I have scarcely heard anyone mention it, but for my money it is the single most comically dense of all of Woody's films.  There are so many truly impressive/hilarious/memorable one-liners that I'm amazed people don't quote this movie left and right. The setting, costumes, accents all add to the hilarity of the film--truly reminiscent of a Marx Brothers romp.  Really outstanding among his pre-Annie Hall films.  Only rivaled by Bananas in my opinion for simple laugh value.Unlike any other of his films, this deals with his deep questions of death/metaphysics in an unflaggingly light and comical fashion.  For instanceSonja But judgment of any system or a priori relation of phenomena exists in any rational or metaphysical or at least epistemological contradiction to an abstracted empirical concept such as being or to be or to occur in the thing itself or of the thing itself.Boris Yeah, I've said that many times.Not Woody's best film (see Annie Hall, Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors), but perhaps his most laugh-filled.

To avoid suffering one must not love, but then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love, to be happy then is to suffer but suffering makes one unhappy, therefore to be unhappy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness.

Why?First, I love Dostoyevsky, and his twisted take on Dostoyevsky is so hilarious, but also so informed, that it lands me on my ass. Second, his dialogue is soexistentialist and yet so ridiculous (Yes, but objectivity is subjective. Not in any rational scheme of perception.) that it makes Ingmar Bergman look like a fool, which he isn't, but it's so much fun to deconstruct the big guy. Third, I love the scene when the little kid questions death about the afterlife. (Are there girls?) I love the one-liners, especially when, surveying the battlefield with all the bodies lying around, Woody's companion says He was our village idiot. and Woodyreplies So what did you do? Place? Mainly I love it because it is intellectual but also as silly as hell. In the movie pantheon, Woody is up there in the godhead, along with Bergman and Dreyer.

Love and Death is probably the most cerebral of the slapstick films and what I suspect a collaboration between Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman and the Marx Brothers would have looked like had one ever taken place.  Sight gags abound along with the philosophical discussions Woody Allen films have as a matter of course.

After the relatively immature but amusing Bananas & Everything You always Wanted To Know About Sex, Allen goes up a notch in the intellectual comedy stakes to produce this fine send-up of Russian culture & historical caricature.Even though some of the one-liner jokes don't always come off it doesn't matter because you never really get chance to think too much about how droll it is because Allen has another half dozen gags waiting in the wings.But I've often found that Allen works best when he has a foil for his anarchic humour and thank the Lord he managed to find the wonderful talent of Ms Keaton. She may not be his intellectual equal but she can run him to ground in nearly everything else. She has a kind of naive charm in this movie, always daydreaming, never really listening to Allen's mutterings & jabberings. And with this naivity brings warmth, humility and a general sense of well being.At the same time Allen can release all his pentup emotions, fears, neo-neurosis to Keaton knowing full well that she wouldn't have a single notion as to what he was on about.And thats what makes this partnership so durable whether it be here in Love & Death, or Sleeper, Annie Hall or Manhattan Murder Mystery. The scripts may vary but they're held together by the spontaneity of the two stars.It should be said also that Love & Death breaks new ground for Allen, because even though he still relies on the childish humour of his earlier films, it is also quite clear that he is more forthcoming with his angst against a problematic world. His philosophic nuances dominate a lot of the film, which he will put to more practical use in his latter films like Annie Hall & Manhattan. But here he gets the mix between jokes & existentualism just right.Love & Death is quite literally a laugh a minute. Whatever people may say about his recent personal problems it cannot be denied that this guy is a pure talent and should be cherished for what he is - a man that makes the world a happier place, if only for a few hours!****/***** "},{"Title":"The last of Woody's uneven (but still hilarious) comedies","Date":"11 October 2001","Score":"26 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, War","Review":"  Love and Death is one of my favourite Woody Allen films, right up there with Manhattan, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Deconstructing Harry. Sure, the jokes are scattershot and don't always work, but when they do the film is a gut-buster. (A tremendous amount of wheat!) Parodying everything from Russian literature to foreign films (especially those of his beloved Ingmar Bergman), it's also one of Allen's most overtly philosophical films with characters breaking into syllogisms and formal arguments at the most unlikely moments. Students of philosophy should get a kick out of it.That said, it is accessible to just about anybody. Almost nobody does fish-out-of-water comedy as well as Woody Allen (see also Bananas and Sleeper), and Diane Keaton shines as usual as the promiscuous object of his desire. And look for Jessica Harper in a small role as the cousin who rattles off a convoluted list of romantic entanglements worthy of Chekhov.This was the last step of Allen's formative period.

Woody was perfect in his role, probably my favorite acting from him along with his acting in Annie Hall.

Although both of whom take two divergent ways in their lives, those paths cross once again . When Napoleon threatens to invade the Russian Empire, the coward soldier is forced to enlist to save his natal nation . Later on , Boris and his lover cousin formulate a scheme to assassinate Napoleon (James Tolkan) . At the end he is detained and the condemned man reviews his past life .Amusing picture fable is plenty of the filmmaker's signature angst-ridden philosophical comedy . Hilarity slips into vulgarity rather too often in this usually in-and-out early Woody Allen comedy which embroils the little man in Russia invaded by Napoleon . Like a Russian soldier , the gags and funny sketches fire off in all directions . There is a lot of spoofs and even Bergman's ¨The seventh seal¨ and ¨Persona¨ and jokes for moviegoers . As the movie featured the Death character of The Grim Reaper , Allen is known to be inspired and influenced by Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman who had featured the Grim Reaper in his film The seventh seal (1957) ; in the Bergman film the Grim Reaper wears black robes whereas in this film he wears a white gown . The movie is considered a spoof of the Russian Novel and every major Russian novel particularly the works of Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky, especially The Idiot, The Gambler, War and Peace, Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, and The Brothers Karamazov. In fact , the movie title is a play on words of such Russian novel titles as Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace and Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment . Nice acting by Woody Allen at his best , as a condemned man who reviews the follies of his life . His comic style paid homage to a number of classic comedians which included Bob Hope, Charles Chaplin and The Marx Brothers ; in fact , it is like a remake of Bob Hope's Monsieur Beaucaire (1946). Intermittently hilarious , pre-Annie Hall Allen fare , it is is one of eight cinema movie collaborations of Woody Allen and actress Diane Keaton, Allen co-starring in six of them and directing seven of them . These are the followings  Play It Again Sam , Sleeper , Interiors , Manhattan , Radio Days , and Manhattan Murder Mystery . It is fun enough to make wish there were more of it and you will have to keep your eyes peeled to spot notorious secondaries as Jessica Harper , Harold Gould , Olga Georges Picot , Féodor Atkine , Gérard Buhr , Howard Vernon and James Tolkan as Napoleón and his double and about ¨fifty-four supporting players .Witty as well as classical musical score contributes much . The soundtrack was originally scored with the music of Igor Stravinsky, but Woody Allen thought it made the scenes unfunny. He discovered Sergei Prokofiev's lighthearted music worked far better . The movie's big battle sequence features Sergei Prokofiev's cantata music from Sergei M. Eisenstein's epic Alexánder Nevsky (1938). Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet , being shot on location in Hungary and Paris , France . Lavish and stunningly produced by Charles H. Joffe , Allen's ordinary producer . This enjoyable motion picture was vigorously directed by Woody Allen , being his sixth film as director . Woody Allen has said that this movie was my funniest picture to that time.

He vowed to get even with Tolstoy and all the rest of those heavy Russian dramatists and in Love And Death I do believe he succeeded. And if you ever were forced to sit through all that turgid prose and heavy dramatics than Love And Death is the film you've longed for. The time is the Napoleonic Wars and the flower of Russian manhood is answering the colors. But Woody comes from a different patch than the other flowers bloomed in and he's not that crazy about sacrificing for old mother Russia.The overall tone of Love And Death is a homage to Groucho Marx and years earlier I could have seen the Marx Brothers doing something like Love And Death with a bit more creative control, just like what Woody Allen has with his movies. But the military scenes were out of the Bob Hope school of cowardice playbook. Lest anyone think that only Russian literature got a good satire, Allen includes a take off on Eugene O'Neill's Strange Interlude as Allen and Diane Keaton both go into those stage soliloquys about what the future holds for them as a couple. Love And Death a must for Woody Allen and a missionary film for those looking to convert someone to being a Woody Allen fan.

And plants eating plants and animals eating... it's like an enormous restaurant.) but cowardly young scholar Boris Grushenko (Woody Allen) is caught by an unpleasant surprise when moved to enlist into the Russian Army (I'm not the army type. I slept with the lights on till I was 30. I can't shower with other men.) in order to fight for Mother Russia (She is not my mother.

Boris' misfortunes begin as early as in an army training camp where we get a significant dose of slapstick in a form of a few cliche gigs (very similar to the ones in 1971's Bananas) of Woody's pastimes with guns and other types of ammunition. Then while of furlough, our hero's adventure continues as he comes in a very close contact with the imminent danger of social illness (I went to a brothel ones in my life. I got hiccups) and while in Sankt-Petersburg bumps into a femme fatale Countess Alexandrovna (Ample bosoms,yes?

The comic timing on display is nearly perfect, and the film does a great job of staying unpredictable with the visual gags and constantly moving forward. Allen and Keaton have never been more fun to watch on screen, and they're aided by a strong supporting cast. The writing is extremely clever as well, satirizing Russian literature and making references to such films as The Seventh Seal and the works of Sergei Eisenstein. The film doesn't require you to have seen those films to find the references funny, though, and that's due to the brilliant execution. The film also contains Allen's trademark mock-philosophical debates that have been seen in his other films, except this time I found them far more engaging and funny than usual instead of rolling my eyes.The use of music was also clever, especially during the big, epic battle scene, which makes use of the music from Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky; an excellent touch. That scene also winds up becoming one of the funniest in the entire film. Those who are fans of the likes of Charlie Chaplin and The Marx Brothers will want to check this film out as well since it pays tribute to them. Diane Keaton played her best character in all of Allen's films here, as it's both fully developed and charming. Demonstrating Allen at his most eclectic and creative, it's here that he made perhaps the most entertaining period piece (if you can call it that) of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, I can't recommend it enough. Even if you don't find it as funny as I did, it's likely you'll still be amused by it.

Yet, there's something more appealing in Love and Death, a sort of endearing quality in the main character, Sergei Dimitriovitch, brilliantly portrayed by Woody Allen supported by a superb performance from Diane Keaton as the delicious, frivolous and voluptuous Sonja. I never thought Kay Adams could be so damn sex... I mean, funny.Sure, Woody plays the usual neurotic and tormented character but combined with the period setting and the picaresque narrative, it immediately provides a hilarious twist. He's insecure, weak, short, ugly, in a way, he makes us feel superior or luckier, but as the movie progresses, and as we get deeper in his subconscious, we're contaminated by his endless questionings about the meaning of life. Woody Allen's Love and Death takes very seriously the humor it uses to make fun of seriousness, and the inner intelligence of the film relies on the level of absurdity it shamelessly reaches while tackling metaphysical subjects such as love, death, life, sex, and turning them into the most pleonastic derision. Ultimately, Woody Allen's epic period masterpiece resonates as the triumphant intellectual demonstration that life is damn too serious to be taken seriously, life is about living, enjoying, having fun, sex&#x85; Disguised in cowardice and refusal to make war, Sergei's approach is in fact more hedonistic and inspirational in its intelligent demonstration that even for the average schmuck, the greatest things can work out of a misunderstanding!But misunderstanding implies the use of intelligence, and if there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, there's no funnier comedy that one with intelligence. And the mightiest power of intelligence relies on its capacity to exceed its idiomatic limits and idiotic means to defy the great law that defines our existence absurdity. Love and Death echoes the philosophical condition of our limited intelligence that can only bow to the all-powerfulness of God, and the infinity of the Universe and smell the stinking feet of our mortal condition. But instead of crying over that defining reality, Allen teaches us to laugh about it. Laugh is the mourning of truth's death. And no mourning could be more glorious than the joyful ballet between Woody Allen and the white-draped Death with the catchy music of Serge Prokofiev, highlighting with a prodigious harmony the cheerful nature of Death, as the ultimate way to get rid of all the torments inherent to life, now, cynicism has never been so deliriously funny! Woody indeed never rhymed so well with funny, at the pinnacle of his comedic period, after Take the Money and Run or Bananas, before his films would rely essentially on homages, especially to Ingmar Bergman. Woody would never be funnier, which is not saying much because this is one of the funniest films ever. Sergei is naturally comical as a living anachronism with his modern existentialist questions, one century and half before this thinking would be developed by Sartre and Camus, not to mention his trademark black horn-rimmed glassed. The whole film is a delightful experiment on the countless possibilities to make people laugh. Slapstick comedy à la Keaton and Chaplin, wisecracking jokes à la Groucho Marx, naughty and vulgar humor à la Mel Brooks, everything deliciously enrobed with a Comedia Dell' Arte grandeur and decadence. And still with this unique Allenian feel, as he successfully transcends his comical abilities and make you laugh from the most unlikely intelligent stuff, and somewhat, we get the intelligence of his script more efficiently through the medium of humor, the genius of Love and Death is that we may get more from Bergman through THIS film, than the movies it supposedly make laugh of. Think about this  To laugh is proper to man. To make someone laugh is to awake the most humanistic side of his nature. Intelligence is proper to man, too. To laugh is to be intelligent. But nonsense makes laugh, therefore, nonsense inspires intelligence. Nonsense is intelligence when it awakes the most humanistic side of his nature. But to makes laugh, nonsense requires intelligence, intelligence inspires nonsense. Yet intelligence condemns nonsense, and then nonsense condemns nonsense. Defining nonsense is depriving it from its essence, therefore its existence, and what exists through its non existence defies the notion of truth and reason. Nonsense is absurd. But what is absurd is funny. Absurd makes laugh. Absurd is proper to man. Nonsense is proper to man. Quod Erat Demonstrandum.Of course, everything you read doesn't make sense, but it does obey to a certain logic that governs our intelligence, the quest for a meaning. All the purpose of humanity, of the philosophers who passed this world was to find a meaning, to end up with the same conclusion that there's no proper conclusion, no possibility to reason with the human condition without getting confused or mixed up with so many frustrating concerns. If one must accept the existence of God, he should accept whatever God gives him, including the free will that allows him to doubt His existence Knowledge implies doubt, doubt inspires knowledge and vice versa, knowledge constructs intelligence, enough intelligence to get the absurdity of the world. To build knowledge to deconstruct the world. That's the essence of absurdity And Woody Allen raises above the absurdity of our world a masterpiece of pure hilarity, proving that if he's not the Eisenstein (God forbid his glasses were ever broken), he's surely the Einstein of film-making!

In one instance, a priest suggests that Spinoza proves God's existence. Boris and Sonja banter back and forth about epistemology and such, and only once does Sonja really offer any advice worth taking in that to love is to suffer and to not know love is to suffer, which really amounts to little more than life is suffering, something the Buddhists or Schopenhauer would have embraced.But then again, you have wise men spouting off silliness, including the view that German Jews have stripes, and Russian Jews have horns. We are left to conclude, as Boris quickly does, that being logical in an illogical world is a complex and unfavorable situation.It has been said that the use of Sergei Prokofiev for the soundtrack adds to the Russian flavor of the film. Other parts referencing Russian culture include a dialogue between Boris and his father with each line alluding to or being composed entirely of Dostoevsky titles. This is crucial to really get the point of how backwards everything was across.I was not able to fully appreciate the film because I am ignorant of its references to the works of Bergman (notably Persona and Smiles of a Summer Night). But that is true of much of Allen's work, I think. His constant references to Dostoevsky did reach me but may have been missed by others. Yet, even if few completely get the picture, it remains beautiful and humorous just the same. Allen has called this his favorite picture, even more so than Annie Hall. I have to see more to be sure, but as of now I am inclined to agree.

Allen's relationship with God, faith and morality has been explored in both his comedies and his dramas, and this story of two peasants in Tsarist Russia who set out to kill Napoleon is no exception. The film begins with a narration by Boris (Allen) as he awaits execution (it was supposed to be a 5 a.m. but a good lawyer got him an hour's reprieve), and he explains how he wound up in prison.There are some hilarious moments in this movie, filmed in Hungary, but the comedy comes off as uneven and even at an hour and a half, it seems long. In an interview, Allen said that he imitated Bob Hope spewing one-liners. One of the most interesting parts of the film is to hear him do exactly that and how different the Hope-type patter sounds when channeled by Allen. (Don Adams' Get Smart voice was an imitation of William Powell; Paul Lynde was imitating Alice Ghostley, yet this probably never occurs to anyone.) Boris' discussions about murder and morality with his wife, the promiscuous Sonja, are very funny. He and Keaton make a great team.Allen comes down on the side of no God or if there is one, as stated previously, he's an underachiever. In fact, there is even a lying angel. Drama or comedy, Allen's films are usually thought-provoking, even hidden behind his non-Hope deadpan line readings and nebbishy face. His work is always worth seeing, and the cleverness and art of Love and Death will not be lost on the viewer.

In fact, Love and Death could be seen as something of a comedic take on certain themes prevalent in Kubrick's aforementioned masterpiece, with both films employing notions of loyalty, war, love, death, games and deception. True, Stanley would never have had his main protagonist shot out of a cannon into the exploding tent of the enemy, or, offered us a supporting character who spends more time worrying about fish than tending to the needs of his young wife... but still, the intention is there.Because of this, the film works on a number of levels... firstly, as a comedy, or more importantly, as a spoof of historical epics, whilst the constant allusions to Russian literature and Russian cinema throughout (check the cross-cutting of the lions during Boris and Sonja's sex-scene, or the soldier shot through the eye in battle as a references to Battleship Potemkin) offer another layer of entertainment. It also offers some rather deep moments and ruminations on the nature of war and humanity and, of course, love and death itself... though these are sugarcoated beneath references to the likes of Socrates, Chaplin, Thomas Aquinas and, most obviously, Bergman.Woody is at his best as the wise-cracking Grushenko, stumbling through battles, banquets and an assassination plot, whilst simultaneously offering more comic one-liners than an open mic night. This, along with Sleeper, is probably Woody's best film in terms of non-stop verbal comedy, with the back and forth sparring between Allen and his muse of this era, Diane Keaton (who is on great comic form as the loveless Sonja) is more obvious than it would be in later (more mature) projects like Annie Hall and Manhattan, with the pair managing to make jokes about everything, from war, to relationships and the metaphysical. Obviously I can't list every single classic line or sight gag, since there are far too many; though it must be said that the character of the father (a land-owner who literally carries his miniscule plot around in his pocket; one day I hope to build on it he says... and he does!!) is comedy genius, whilst the back and forth dialog between Boris and the Countess Alexandra is Allen at his wittiest (you're the greatest lover I've ever had she breathes, before Allen replies well, I practice a lot when I'm alone).The film is packed full of great moments, beautiful photography and production design and some perfectly judged comedic performances (further proof that Allen is one of the best and most underrated filmmakers in America), from Allen's bumbling, bespectacled assassin, to the dry and neurotic creation of Keaton (I'm having trouble adjusting my belt... do you think you could come over here and hold my bosom for a while?), whilst there's strong support from Olga Georges-Picot, Harold Gould, James Tolkan and Jessica Harper.The ending is perfectly pitched, finding the right balance between the farce and the comic pathos, with Woody indulging his influences once again, with that great Tarkovsky-like rumination on wheat (with Allen framing Keaton and Harper in a manner that brings to mind the framing of Liv Ullman and Bibi Anderson in Bergman's Persona) and that final shot that has Woody dancing through the trees with Death... a delightful homage to Bergman's The Seventh Seal. Love and Death is brilliant stuff from beginning to end, filled with great moments of wit (and sight-gags that predate the giddy likes of Airplane and Police Squad), and, is a film that could, quite easily, be considered as Allen's first masterpiece... comedic or otherwise.

The humor of this film touches on such topics as pacifism, warfare and mock highbrow philosophical debates. Battle scenes in the film are shot with the finesse of more serious war films of the 1970s, but are cast in a comical fashion. There is also Allen's final monologue, which is utterly hilarious, particularly his comment about God.

He plays Boris Grushenko, a Russian peasant who enlists in the army when Napoleon invades. From there, much of the movie involves a series of gags based in Allen's unique version of humor. As for the presence of Death, you can clearly see the connection to Ingmar Bergman. I think that my favorite part was Boris's monologue towards the end about sex; only Woody Allen would say that! All in all, this is one of Allen's best. It just goes to show that he does best when going with straight comedy and not when trying to include a bunch of stuff about relationships. As Boris's love interest Sonja, Diane Keaton is as great as in just about every other role. That line about her skin is a classic (and another one that only Woody Allen could dream up).

Because this is a film that first appears to be slapstick with quick quotes, funny lines, and hilarious dialog, it is often disregarded, but it is really significant movie art.Not to become too philosophical, but it is also a kind of serious movie, with extreme undertones of satire regarding the ultimate human joke, that is a subjective, or is it objective philosophy towards life, love, and death? It makes ultimate fun of the subject matter of it's entitlement Love and Death. Woody Allen was quoted once as remarking that this was the favorite of his films, at least of that comic creative period of his during the1970's. I would have to agree with the director, as this tiny little 90 minute gem is my favorite Allen escape into the ultimate question, and the most perfect flight into the darkness of human insecurities, about immortality, as treated with humor.Woody is really on with his stand up shtick in this film . His jokes come a mile a minute, with only a few duds, but mostly his deadpan delivery strikes home with logical humor. An amazing comic in his hey day, Allen was truly one of the funniest men on the planet in the 20th century. And joining him in this film is his perfect straight woman which will always be Diane Keaton.One cannot ignore this amazing actress, and classically beautiful woman, Diane Keaton. The persona she projected during her formative acting career in the 1970's through 1980's was inspired and stunning. She was both a comedienne genius, but also an impressive dramatic female presence, in particular in the Godfather series, and in the so tragic brilliant but flawed film Looking for Mr. Goodbar. Diane possessed a sort of lovely vulnerability, with high cheekbones, steel blue gray eyes, with quick and slight movements, long and tragic fingers, and a delicious overbite that brightened her unique, compelling, sensuous, optimistic, yet always fragile smile.The rest of the cast are chosen for their physical look. In particular the part of French Emperor Napoleon. This is a sort of period piece set in the time of the Napoleonic wars, and it is interesting to see the mock battles between the French and Russians seemingly almost Barry Lyndon accurate when they were not made fun of.The final barometer of this film is that Love and Life are about suffering and that Death is better than spending an evening with an insurance salesman.Love and Death A Woody Allen film than many critics rate as mediocre is misunderstood, as this lovely treatise on the satirical side of making fun of philosophy, by the comic master, Woody Allen, is by this critic, highly recommended to any thinking man's DVD collection. I look forward to viewing it again soon.B. A.

Love and Death is a beautiful-looking film, lush scenery and opulent costumes as well as beautifully shot, of his pre-Annie Hall films Love and Death is his best-looking and quite possibly also among his overall filmography.

The philosophical stuff Allen includes is very intelligently incorporated and nothing comes across as biased or offensive, Allen has plenty to say and does so in a way that has his style all over it without feeling self-indulgent. The story is enormously entertaining from start to finish, very silly but in an endearing and genuinely hysterical way, once you get the references Love and Death is quite possibly among his most accessible films as well. Allen does a terrific job directing and his performance as a purposefully anachronistic character is just as great. No complaints to be had from the rest of the cast either, Diane Keaton in particular is sublime in one of her better performances in a Woody Allen film.

Revered because he is an absolute genius; maddening for the same reason. Even if you have never seen a film he has written and directed, you have no doubt heard his one liners Don't knock masturbation, it's sex with someone I love. I'm not afraid of death, I just don't want to be there when it happens. I'm not really the heroic type, I was beat up by Quakers. His jokes have a delivery that mocks the greats like Rodney Dangerfield and Bob Hope yet Woody Allen's unique on screen persona imposes at least a superficial level of earnestness and faux-intellectualism. It's especially maddening to think he's so freakishly prolific! Since 1969 he has written and directed at least one film a year. Not all of them cinematic gold but considered he has been nominated for an Oscar 18 times for writing, directing and producing I'd say a good chunk of his filmography is pretty darn good.In fact while my exposure to his filmography is less than complete, there's truly not a film I wouldn't see again. The worst I've seen was a little known box office bomb by the name of Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001) with a post Mad About You (1992-1999) Helen Hunt. It felt like a failed TV pilot but nevertheless was entertaining enough to slug through. If it were on TV about as often as The Mummy Returns (2001) I'd probably watch it again if nothing else were on.The best Woody Allen film I personally have seen is 1975's Love and Death. Like Curse of the Jade Scorpion it wasn't nominated for anything of significance. It didn't curry much favor with audiences either making just north of $20 million and while the critics enjoyed Love and Death it still remains one of Woody Allen's lesser known films. Yet while it's lesser known it's certainly not lesser loved. Vincent Canby of the New York Times calls Love and Death one of Allen's most consistently witty films. It enjoys a 100% Fresh rating on Rottentomatoes.com and most early Allen enthusiasts swear by the Russian literature satire.Woody Allen's sixth directorial effort starts and ends centered on the life of Boris Grushenko (Allen), an impertinent yet cowardly Russian scholar who isn't too fond of going to war with the French and Napoleon. She's (Russia) not my mother. My mother's standing right here, and she's not gonna let her youngest baby get shrapnel in his gums, Boris cries as he has pushed by his stout-hearted family to join the war effort. Once he's thrown into the fray, hijinks ensue in a Marx Brothers meets War and Peace kind of way. But while faced with the insanity of war, all Boris can think about is his lovely cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton) who he's had the hots for since childhood.Love and Death evokes memories of Duck Soup (1933) and The Great Dictator (1940) only with less political satire and more philosophical and humanistic satire. One of the reoccurring jokes involves Boris and Sonja taking inopportune moments to argue philosophy using jargon literally lifted from the existentialist writings of G.I. Gurdjieff and P.D. Ouspensky. Philosophy gets skewered along with the thick tomes of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, the historical significance of the Napoleonic wars and the films of Sergei Eisenstein and Ingmar Bergman. Who knew you could cram so many high-minded material into an 85 minute movie who's big battle scene involves Woody wearing a cheerleader outfit and a guy walking around yelling get your red hots.While Allen has fallen out of favor since his heyday in the 1970's and early 80's (much of which is credited to his tumultuous personal life), his movies still create a blip on the cultural radar every once in a while. Friends my age were introduced to his comedic work through Midnight in Paris (2011). A movie that brought to mind another favorite of mine, The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985). His latest Blue Jasmine (2013), while closer in mood to Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989) is nevertheless a stupendous film.I think most, if not everyone could find a Woody Allen film they'll enjoy.

While it's still very much a comedy, Love And Death is noticeably mellower, slower, more mature than Woody's earlier films, with more attention paid to the story and to the general production. It's also more philosophical and theological, as Woody constantly questions the existence of God (I wouldn't want to blow my brains out and THEN learn that they found something up there!). It does get too verbose for its own good at times, and some parts just don't come off (his monologue about Socrates, for example). But Love And Death also contains some of the most unforgettable visual gags (his military training) and classic punchlines (You are the greatest lover I've ever had - I practice a lot when I'm alone!) of Allen's career. And Diane Keaton, besides being great to look at, proves once again that her contribution to Allen's movies is invaluable - Woody himself once again, to an even larger extent than in Sleeper, trusts her with some comic scenes without his presence, which she pulls off fantastically (I could have made love to you more often....once even!!).

Set in Russia in the early 19th century, it is a satire of all things Russian; from 19th century novels to Sergei Eisenstein movies. Its references are often pretty high-brow but seeing as its Allen there are also a lot of pure funny moments. This combination between sophisticated humour and sight gags is what makes Allen's early films so distinctive, and in Love and Death it's a combination at its most extreme. From philosophical discussions on the meaning of life to a man who keeps a sod of earth in his pocket, this movie covers a lot of comic ground.It lacks the narrative cohesion of Sleeper and is overall a bit fragmented. Like a bunch of disparate ideas loosely tied together by theme rather than story. It almost feels more like a series of sketches. It isn't always successful but there are certainly enough laughs. Allen is also very ably supported by Diane Keaton who is a great comic partner for him once again.So not Allen's best but one of his most ambitious and different. And still very funny in places.

Allen gets awfully silly about much of this, but his philosophical conclusions aren't any worse than the pontifications of a lot of great men. but i'm always a little skeptical and hard to please in this category, so irreverence works for me as much as anything.this is really good film making and great farce. the use of the film score from 'Alexander Nevsky' was a hoot.

Part of the humour is the visual references, to Slavko Vorkapich's seminal Napoleonic battle montages for The Firefly (1937) for example, and also more obviously to Battleship Potemkin. There is a great example of deep focus work whilst Allen's character Boris masquerades as Don Francisco and tussles in the background whilst a conversation occurs in the near foreground. Frankly I found that shot quite movingly beautiful and almost forgot to laugh. The movie gives a whirlwind tour of the cinematographic repertoire, and there is some good wide angle shooting to, as well in textbook lessons in composition.The ladies on show prove that Allen had a good eye for female beauty, and I found the movie almost embarrassingly erotic at points.I enjoyed myself immensely, discovering Prokofiev's upbeat Lieutenant Kijé (Suite for Orchestra, Opus 60), and delighting in the intellectual silliness of the debates and also the sheer determined optimism of clothing Death all in white. Allen's self-pillorying (the crucified child) is economical and provokes belly laughter.

Woody Allen's Love and Death, had me in stitches in the first three minutes, and it only gets better. There is a fine line between goofy and funny, and most films that try do not even come close to wedding them. Monty Python usually gets it right, but there are very few comedies which do it so brilliantly as this one.Love and Death is Allen's satirical portrayal of 19th century Russia, the age of Tolstoy and the war with Napoleon. Even when you hear Woody Allen's first lines, you may find yourself in titters already, simply by the fact that he retains his New York accent. If the youngest in your family is over twelve years of age, I would say Love and Death would make a great family feature, assuming you've worked your way through all the Mel Brooks films or all the Disney/Pixar films. The This one is mostly goofy comedy, but there is a fair amount of mature humour as well.One of the keys in making the transition from silly to funny is in both context and delivery. There is a moment in the film where Allen says to a girl you look more beautiful standing here than you do in person Could there be a more stupid line in film? probably not. Coming from Woody Allen however, (delivering the line as if it is a completely mundane thing to say) it is a scream. I'd like to conclude with one last piece of advice. If you watch Love and Death, don't make it a dinner movie, because whatever you are eating you will choke on it from laughter.

Though I have seen almost his entire oeuvre, I think of this one as his break out film, the real Woody as filmmaker, while allowing us to see the true comic genius he is as a performer and filmmaker. Too bad the French appreciate him more than we do as an American audience, which is why they heaped awards and praise upon him through his life.I think what gets by many people is that Woody can also be a serious artistic film director, as surely as any Europe produced in the latter twentieth century. Like any of those efforts, Woody uses the whole drama canvass and this is where he stands apart. Does he repeat himself sometimes through his movies? Sure, but how many times did Van Gogh or Picasso repeat themselves? Celluloid is the same as those other mediums.But upon watching this movie again this week, it made me realize something I have not seen in the other reviews, the influence of the Marx brothers comedies on this film. The obvious zinging sounds, the casual verbal double entendre repartee, the put upon Napoleon double, it's all there. Another insight I picked up this time is that fourth wall breakdown, connection to the audience. While that was standard in early t.v. comedies such as the variety shows, in movies, Woody really pioneers that effort, mimicked to great effect in 'Ferris Buller's Day Off' and even not so great films such as 'Kuffs'.The film is essentially a riff on Russian Literature, Russian music, Ingmar Bergman films, European philosophy, stream-of-consciousness self-awareness. Woody was self mocking Jewishness long before Sasha Baron Cohen and his Borat character arrived on the scene - the purists out there will state Jackie Mason actually pioneered this but not in film. Either way, if one were to begin watching Woody Allen films, this would be the start, where he finally perfected the comic template that would not change until he started channeling his inner Bergman.Sidenote I actually have seen Woody in person, up close, at the Parthenon in Athens, of all places. Regretfully, I never got to meet him but only spoke to his wife briefly. "}{"Title":"A Novel Spoof","Date":"30 July 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, War","Review":" Love and Death is a novel idea, because of all the spoofs---Airplane!, The Naked Gun, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, these horrible new ones like Meet the Spartans and Superhero Movie---Love and Death parodies things none of those other filmmakers would think to. The main thread of the plot is framed like a Russian novel with direct hints at Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, complete with imposed philosophical debates, and freely sprinkled across the film are direct send-ups of Ingmar Bergman films, namely Persona and Smiles of a Summer Night.Love and Death is a special, unique film, a testament to the inventiveness of a certain comic mind, when Woody began exercising not only more ambitious experimentation with the comic possibilities of cinema, but also more cinematic ways of telling an actual story, polishing the banana-peel attitude of Sleeper on the journey to Annie Hall, and, like What's Opera, Doc?, an feat of artistic deflating that bolsters the value of art. Woody Allen meets Dostoyevsky, and the two contrast misanthropic viewpoints The world is a big restaurant, God is an underachiever at best, subjectivity is objective, etc. Allen joins unwillingly and a black drill sergeant hollers at him. Allen's darling Diane Keaton in the meantime engages lovers as the old husband retires to his bedroom carrying a herring.The plot is Tolstoy via Bob Hope, with enough room for Mozart and Prokofiev, Eisenstein's stone lions, pistols at dawn with Harold Gould, reflections on the word jejune. The splendor of Ghislain Cloquet's cinematography is part of the gag. Same with Prokofiev, who is intrinsic to the evocation of Czarist Russia, and yet it gives the film a very lively sound. Splendor can hardly appease the heart of a grouch, however, so Allen gets the noose ready, changing his mind at the last minute to start poetry and, later, revolutionary assassination. Other flashes of sublimity include Napoleon insisting on more cream for the pastry that is to carry his name, and the divine presence that assures safety but flakes out at the last minute.Perhaps the first of Woody's films where God and the meaning of life are linked to the question of whether or not life is worth living. He says to Keaton, What if there is no God? What if we're just a bunch of absurd people running around with no rhyme or reason? To which she says, But if there's no God, then life has no meaning. Why go on living, why not just kill yourself? And then of course Woody, Well, let's not get hysterical; I could be wrong. I'd hate to blow my brains out and then read in the papers they found something up there. Keaton audaciously makes the presumption that if God doesn't exist, then life has no meaning and one might as well commit suicide. Woody asserts that if God doesn't exist, then humans are absurd, and he seems to bow to Keaton's implication, to the extent that he implies that if God does exist, then one shouldn't commit suicide. He'd hate to pull the trigger only to learn that God actually does exist.Such illustrates the film's approach, which is to contrast grave matters with a lively comical disorder. At times that's merely a case of setting up a threatening scenario and assaulting it with a punch line, but Allen repeatedly finds a way to make his point visually. That's not to say Woody isn't still chiefly a verbal comic, because he is, and one of the movie's running gags is a perpetual argument about the philosophical and moral choices continually offered the characters.Allen's idea is a straightforward one. Picture the basic Woody character, and put him in Napoleonic Russia. Raise him to be a militant coward, draft him and send him off to fight the French, and then marry him to Diane Keaton who feels sorry for him because (she hopes) he will be shot dead in a duel. He's the ideal foil for the Keaton character, who always wants every situation both ways, with alternatives. There are dozens of small moments when their looks have to be just so, and they virtually always are. There are tinges of humorous import that could have gotten lost if all we had were the words, and there are entire scenes that play off facial expressions.

That's not to say that he wouldn't have more clownish gags in the future, but that this marked the end of his films that were heavily composed of them.Fortunately, there are no long musical sections in this film devoted to silent clowning, but rather Love and Death ties it better into the ongoing action. The setting is Russia pre- and during Napoleonic invasion. Our hero (played by Woody Allen), Boris, is an intellectual son of a wealthy family who is desperately in love with his cousin (played by Diane Keaton). These two have developed an excellent comic chemistry so it's usually quite amusing to watch them babble in Allen-esquire dialog to each other and I found it especially amusing with the rather comic take on philosophical discussions between the two, poking fun at Russian epics as a whole.The story itself wanders from place to place, strung together by the life (and death) of Boris. Consequently, the film is a little uneven and doesn't seem entirely coherent, but there are several amusing comic scenes sprinkled throughout. Unfortunately, the lack of coherence makes it hard to care too much about Boris and his fate.In the end, this is still the better of Allen's early films, simply due to the fact that it comes together a lot better, but the storytelling is still a little meandering and the film escapes attempts to become a whole film rather than a series of segments. In the end, Love and Death ends up feeling more like a spoof (a la Mel Brooks) with a bit of intellectualism and neuroticism thrown into the mix. Still, for its amusing parts, it's enjoyable enough, but hardly a must watch. 7/10.

You know -- if you've seen one, you've seen them all. That is not a fair assessment. Of course, he repeats themes and ideas and muses over philosophical non sequiturs over and over again -- sometimes, ad nauseum. And he certainly isn't above repeating a joke, good or bad. Yet, in his four decades as a filmmaker he has shown a remarkable amount of variety in his style and subject matter, without really straying too far from his home turf. From musicals to murder mysteries, from farces to overtly depressing melodramas, he manages to be fairly unpredictable.Yet, while watching LOVE AND DEATH, it struck me that it is practically a remake of his previous film, SLEEPER. It would seem that the only things they would have in common are that they feature his favored muse, Diane Keaton, and that they are the last two of his so-called early, funny movies. After that, you have SLEEPER, which takes place in the far future in America and LOVE AND DEATH which takes place in Russia, in the far past. Yet, they are both period pieces, mocking specific types of literary/cinematic genres (sci-fi and historical epic) and as such are time warp comedies, wherein most of the humor comes from injecting Woody's 20th century, New York, Jewish/atheist, left-wing, intellectual pessimism into an alien time and place. And looking past the settings, the plots are identical Woody's prototypical nebbish/coward falls in love with Keaton's vapid, but provocative kook, while they both get sucked up in revolutionary politics and plots to assassinate tyrannical leaders.The political assassination angle is intriguing. He treats it in a farcical fashion in both SLEEPER and LOVE AND DEATH, just as it was used as a running gag throughout BANANAS. He'd bring it up again, most famously perhaps, in ANNIE HALL, when he confesses that his character's obsession with the JFK killing was a mere pretense to avoid having sex with his wife. Though Allen has never been a particularly political comedian, this minor obsession with political violence does seem to have a point, whether it was intended as such by Woody or not. Even though he seems to suggest (albeit in jest and with much reluctance and equivocation) that assassination is the wrong, yet possibly the most efficient means of political change; his greater message is the futility of such acts. Reactionary violence, and indeed war itself, is mocked as being pointless and trivial -- which, I suppose, is also his pessimistic outlook on life, art and, well, just about everything else.The one thing he consistently claims to take seriously is death. Yet, even as he places it right up front in the title of LOVE AND DEATH, his vision of it here is that of the purely cliché Grim Reaper -- hood and cycle and all. Indeed, for an artist supposedly obsessed with death, it really isn't part of his repertoire. Woody's own death is a punchline in LOVE AND DEATH, SCOOP and even CASINO ROYALE. In A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S SEX COMEDY, it is a whimsical plot twist and in EVERYONE SAYS I LOVE YOU it is an excuse for a musical number. The murders at the heart of his later films, like CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, MANHATTAN MURDER MYSTERY, BULLETS OVER BR0ADWAY and MATCH POINT, pointedly place the violence off screen. And the suicide in INTERIORS -- like everything else in the film -- is property borrowed from Bergman. Rather than being obsessed with death, Allen seems more inclined to distance himself from it altogether. Certainly one of his limitations as a director is his inability or unwillingness to deal with unpleasant things like death or violence, except in an aloof, second-hand way. His clumsy handling of the battle scenes in LOVE AND DEATH attest to this -- though arguably such scenes are funnier because they are so poorly staged.Despite a title that promises big themes, LOVE AND DEATH is the last of his gag-driven comedies, less interested in plot and character than in churning out comedy bits. It is interesting that even though LOVE AND DEATH is one of Woody's most esoteric films, it is also one of his most accessible ones. Never one to dumb-down his material for mass consumption, he seems to purposely build so much of the humor and action in the film around familiarity with Russian literature and history -- hardly topics of common knowledge (much less interest) to the vast number of filmgoers, even the more sophisticated ones that Allen attracts. Yet, the film is packed with sight gags, anachronisms and universal observations, so that little of the material goes over the viewer's head. Grandiose themes of epic novels and philosophical theories are cut down to size by a burlesque approach that hearkens back visually to the silent era, as well as the low-brow sarcasm of the films of Bob Hope. One doesn't have to understand the philosophy or recognize the literary references to realize that what is being ridiculed isn't just the the source material itself, but the pomposity of it all -- even the pretentiousness of Woody choosing such a high-brow subject in the first place. If you don't get the source of the joke, the way it is reduced to skillful double talk and pseudo-intellectual patter is funny in its own right. For both better and worse, Woody's growth as a filmmaker would soon make him less willing to be so cavalier with such material. But, for all of its obscure literary references, LOVE AND DEATH is one Woody's silliest films -- and one of the reasons we miss his early, funny movies so much.

It's one of those films that's hugely quote worthy with a high number of wonderful Allen witticisms (My room at midnight. Perfect. Will you be there too?) and a few good visual gags peppered here and there. Despite being hugely different stylistically to Annie Hall you can tell that the two scripts have been written by the same man, though the same can't be said about the direction.The plot is more obviously comedic than the rambling, cerebral style of Allen's relationship comedies, with Allen's character trying to get away from fighting in the wars and later being forced into the position of having to assassinate Napoleon. Despite being arguably more structured than many of Allen's films, it runs out of steam far more quickly. Certainly the more introspective philosophising occurs here only in fits and starts with the script going more for broad comedy and one-liners; this means that the film lacks the more relaxed and realistic direction that Allen would tend to use from the next film onwards. There's nothing of the sense of listening to a bunch of people naturally conversing (one thing I adore about some of Allen's films is his ability to make dialogue between characters sound natural, as if he asked the actors to start having a chat and decided to film them), lending Love and Death a greater sense of artificiality. The direction rarely rises above that of generic comedy. This isn't to say that the film is bad of course - it's very funny, and Allen and Keaton are both absolutely superb in their roles, never putting a foot wrong - but it's certainly not Allen at his best (though probably remains more accessible than his best movies). Fortunately, a quite good film for Woody Allen is still way better than most other comedies.It's certainly no Annie Hall or Hannah and Her Sisters, but Love and Death is an amusing 80 minutes of fun with several of the flashes of genius that Woody Allen would display more wholesomely and effectively in future works.

Action movies have chases and explosions, horror movies have suspense and gore, and comedies have funny characters and jokes. However, they rarely lead anywhere. Sure they may be funny (or exciting or scary), but they don't very frequently leave the audience thinking or feeling truly delighted days after they've seen them. They just sort of whither away and are completely gone by the time the viewer is ready to watch the next movie on their list. This goes doubly in this age of American Pie and teen comedies. And triply when in the past years Hollywood has resorted to parodying itself with titles like Scary Movie, all 5(6? 7?) of them. This trend that went on to parodying other genres and its latest offering was Epic Movie. Needless to say it isn't going very far.Maybe it is time when Hollywood can look back at the wisdom of the ages and then not redo it with fancy new technology, but rather re-imagine it with some new ideas. Love and Death is a prime example that the movie industry could use as a spring board for creating a farce out of something other than itself. There were films like Team America that were original spoofs, but given the profane content they were as accessible to all as most of Woody Allen's classic farces.

A comic jewel, it's essentially a intellectual comedy; an existentialist/philosophical historical costume epic parody based on 19th century Russian classics (Dotoevsky, Tolstoy, Pushkin). At the same time the film seems somewhat influenced by acclaimed Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal, except this time set in Czarist Russia at the time of Napoleon. Released in 1975, it soon faded from many people's memory in the light of the more famous Annie Hall which was released later in 1977. Beloved Hollywood actress Diane Keaton and Woody Allen were already a team before that film, as evidenced in this film and the films they worked on together after this one. As mentioned, Love And Death is a parody of Russian literary classics like War And Peace by Tolstoy and Crime and Punishment by Dotoevsky (hence the three word- title Love and Death). Woody Allen stars as Borish Grushenko, an intellectual, sensitive young man from the Russian countryside. He has a brawny brother named Ivan, who is dim-witted but far more attractive to the ladies, an imperious and domineering mother, a father who is dull and seemingly bored of his marriage, and a crazy uncle who believes a small piece of land and small-scale model of a manor is his actual property. Throughout the film, Boris only loves Sonja (Diane Keaton) who is his intellectual equal but who prefers his brother Ivan for a sexual partner. Napoleon's French armies invade Russia and war ensues. Reluctantly, Boris serves in the army and out of pure luck, gets awarded a medal (he is shot out of a cannon and lands on enemy lines, defeating the enemy commander). Later on, Boris and Sonja marry and engage in a mission to murder the tyrannical Napoleon, a mission which fails and results in Boris' tragic execution. The film typifies Woody Allen's blend of social, philosophical, sexual and visual comedy, neatly organized so that despite its overwhelming excess, it's still very logical and well-written. Almost every line of dialog and piece of visual is a joke- i.e. Sonja says to her first husband's friend, While my husband's away let's play, with a clear sexual implication but in the next shot they are playing a piano and violin duet, or the shot of Boris hanging from the Cross early in the film as he says he was different from his brothers. The characters, especially the principal ones, lament their mortality, seek great truths, question God's existence, and search for meaning in a world that has gone mad. Even with all this good stuff, this film is a lesser success and considerably amateurish next to Allen's more mature, complex and yet hilarious films from the 80's and early 90's. But nevertheless, Love And Death is highly enjoyable and represents a time in the life of Woody Allen when he was budding as a comedian, but not yet reaching the level of success he began with Annie Hall. The scenes between Allen and Death are really innovative and well-written, as is the entire script, and the cinematography is superb, looking as if it were a serious historical film epic along the lines of Doctor Zhivago, making the film somehow even more funny for its serious look. That final monologue by Allen is wonderfully true and well-spoken, and yet somehow comic and sad in its delivery. It seems to express that, even in the face of the inevitable Death that claims everyone, we must enjoy life, seek happiness and meaning and laugh and dance with Death as Allen does in the final shot. With music by the Russican Romantic composer Sergei Prokofiev(Woody Allen favored his light but yet serious music for this film) and Woody Allen's usual flair for thinking man's comedy, this is a great early Allen film and a nearly forgotten treasure of comedy.

Diane Keaton as half saint/half whore Sonja (foreshadowing her serious Looking for Mr. Goodbar character) is simply marvelous and provides a beautiful comic foil for Allen.

Whatever his weirdness and personal problems, he is one of those people who sees the insanity, the beauty, and the possibilities of everything we are.  He is the humble commentator who can take the familiar and push it to the nth degree and do it with style. Love and Death was part of his heyday.  He takes on the entire history of Russia, Dostoevsky, Pasternak, Eisenstein, and Tolstoy, and plays with every nuance that is available. Boris is the same cowardly creature that bumbles his way through all of life, but like Groucho Marx, he always knows when he comes upon the moment.I would just like to talk about some of my favorite scenes, and these are far from completeWhen they drop the village idiot, whom they have adopted, at the Village Idiot's Convention.  There are a huge group of similar figures, dancing around, their fingers in their mouths.The eating of snow to survive the Zhivago winter.The little piece of land.The long philosophical discussion that ends in their saying that all they ever talk about is sex.The meeting with the countess, the destroyed room from a blistering sexual encounter.  Yet, five minutes have passed on the clock.Sonja's willingness to marry Boris only if he can assure her that he will be killed the next day.The slapstick attempt to kill the Emperor.The visual quotations from all the great Russian films; especially reversing the positions of the lion statues from standing to sitting; the opposite of Eisenstein in Potemkin.I could go on, but I just need to say that this is one of those films that grow more wonderful, the more you know.  Woody Allen did this when he was less filled with angst and more of an observer of what culture has blessed us with.  No one could parody like Woody Allen and this is a masterpiece.

It stars Woody Allen as the weak Russian brother who is a coward and does not want to go to war. He does anyway, through a series of incompetencies during training, and while trying to hide in a cannon barrel gets launched into the general's tent, killing him and becoming a most unlikely war hero.Diane Keaton, who was his real life lover in 1975, plays his cousin twice removed. They are great friends, but nothing else, except that Allen's character secretly is in love with her.The movie moves on to an attempted assasination of Napoleon.The grim reaper, draped in white robes, plays a role also in this film.If you are a great fan of Woody and slapstick humor, much like Monty Python, then you'll love this film and rate it 10. I give it 6 of 10. I generally get tired of Woody Allen's style before the movie ends, and that happened here for me. My favorite Allen movie is The Purple Rose of Cairo with Jeff Daniels and Mia Farrow. Woody Allens does not act it in, maybe that's why. "},{"Title":"Make it quarter to twelve.","Date":"7 May 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, War","Review":" Tolstoy may have War and Peace, but it pales in comparison to the sweeping gravitas of Allen's Love and Death, which tackles two even more universal issues which plague us all. In this film, Allen shows his remarkable talent at engaging with grander, more immediate themes that his earlier comedies but still have that magic touch which turns any situation into hilarity. The plot is a parody of the dense, high- minded Russian epics, in particular those of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. Allen's neurotic, wimpy type is dropped right into the setting, Russia during the Napoleonic Wars, where all the young men are practically jumping out of their skin to serve their motherland, whilst Boris would rather sheepishly sneak away and work on his butterfly collection. Allen's physical comedy is on show here in brilliant form; most notably in a montage of all his army incompetencies and goofs, his schoolboy wooing tactics of a Countess, and perhaps the most delightful of them all, a muted, sped up slapstick sequence involving Allen, Keaton and a guard they are trying to knock out with an empty bottle, which recalls the silent film masters and their antics. He uses the frame (see the bickering and slap-fighting of Napoleon and his double) and the edit (six minutes later the Countess' room is strewn with overturned furniture like a thief had been through it) to great effect. The film tackles all the dense philosophical ideas of the Russian literature it parodies with a bemused perspective. Boris sticks out like a sore thumb amongst the gruff and uncivil Russian environment and spouts streams of existential jargon that become so complex and redundant that they lose all meaning. He constantly spars verbally with her cousin Sonja, the Anna Karenina figure, who is also embroiled in a web of social anxieties and troubled relationships. Keaton has a remarkable knack for her deadpan delivery of the absurd, further pushing these situations into hilarity I'm twenty eight and he's eighty one. When that man drops dead suddenly in her moment of faux triumph, she quickly decides on another lover, and the film treats it as if they were destined for each other, despite his tendency to talk about the herring industry very seriously and her tendency to sleep around vicariously (the tender deathbed moment interrupted by exaggerated coughing and clearing of throats at the mention of her 'purity' is gold). Watching this with the knowledge of the prevalence of the Allen-type about to boom next with Annie Hall and so on is extremely valuable. Here Allen has the self-awareness of the pitfalls of his intellectual character and has perfectly emphasised them in a context that asks for the opposite. He is not the heroic soldier but rather stumbles onto an opportunity which covers his chest with medals. His awkward aversion for violence is mistaken for the highest of nobilities (A similarly amusing pistol duel that year from Barry Lyndon also mocks the prissy, formal nature of these life-and-death shootouts). He is an intellectual like so many before and after him, and sensual, and as spiritual as he can be, but never really takes life seriously because there is an existential meaningless about it. Life's cruel twist is that he has this sort of spiritual awakening as he is jailed, a Dostoevskian epiphany, and as just as he decides to have found his meaning for living, God stands him up. And so he dances on along with Death. Very funny indeed, in a cruel and ironic way. "},{"Title":"An absolutely hilarious parody of Russian literature and cinema","Date":"21 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, War","Review":" Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, this is an absolutely hilarious parody of Russian literature and cinema. While I have to admit that neither of those things are foremost among my interests, I was sufficiently familiar with them - mostly though not entirely by osmosis - to appreciate many of the jokes. Woody Allen's script is superb and it is replete with wonderful one liners and exchanges while his direction is likewise very strong. The film was shot in Hungary and France and it made great use of the locations. Sergei Prokofiev's compositions added a suitably Russian flair to the proceedings.The film stars Allen as Boris Dmitrievich Grushenko, a self- described militant coward who is not very enthusiastic about fighting for Mother Russia when Napoleon invades Austria. He is a shy, sweet, pacifist scholarly type who wants nothing more than to marry his distant...ish cousin Sonja, played by the superlative Diane Keaton. Sonja is the only person with whom he can have meaningful conversations. They have many moral and philosophical debates, which run the gamut from thought-provoking to nonsensical, and they constitute a fantastic running joke. The same is true of the frequent faux-depressing statements from Sonja and other people. However, Sonja is madly in love with Boris' elder and considerably braver brother Ivan. On the bright side, Boris' luck changes for the better when he is fired from a cannon and lands on a group of French generals, who promptly surrender, and he is hailed as a hero.After Ivan is killed and Sonja's uninteresting herring merchant husband accidentally shoots himself, she agrees to marry Boris as it appears that he is going to be killed in a duel the very next day. He unexpectedly wins - in spite of being shot twice, once by himself - and the two of them tie the knot. Sonja is initially about as happy about marrying him as Boris was about fighting the French but, over time, her platonic love / mild contempt blossoms into romantic love. However, things go a bit pear-shaped when Napoleon invaded Russia. Boris wants to flee but Sonja thinks that it would be a good idea to assassinate Napoleon. Although Boris is less convinced that it is good idea, he goes along with her plan. The headstrong Sonja is not the kind of person who ever chooses the easy way out of a situation and this is the perfect example of this. However, her insane plan leads to some of the funniest scenes in the film as she and Boris are forced to pose as the Spanish nobleman Don Francisco and his sister in order to gain access to the Emperor.The film has a strong supporting cast such as Harold Gould as Anton lvanovich Lebedokov, Jessica Harper as the Countess Natasha and James Tolkan as Napoleon, who rightly considers it imperative that the Napoleon pastry is completed before the Beef Wellington, and his double. It also features nice small appearances from Tony Jay, Aubrey Morris and Sandor Éles. The unconventional battle scene is a delight, as is the Chaplin-esque sequence in which Boris repeatedly hits Sonja in the head with a wine bottle.Overall, this film is a laugh riot with many memorable visuals. One thing is certain I shall never think of wheat in the same way again. "},{"Title":"Wheat","Date":"6 July 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, War","Review":" You can almost imagine the room as Woody Allen sits down with the outline that his follow-up to 'Sleeper' is going to be a satire of 19th-century Russian literature with nods to Bergman and Eisenstein, featuring direct quotes from little-known Russian philosophers and the music of Prokofiev.But... you're still going to wear the funny glasses and be making jokes about New York restaurants, right? Well, yes, naturally... Love and Death is certainly not as obviously funny as Sleeper was. There are still many slapstick moments but they are less drawn out and the film as a whole seems to rattle by at great pace. The chances are you're going to watch it and, like me, think 'well, that was... unusual', then spend some time researching it to discover exactly what it was that you just watched. And then you'll watch it again. And then again. The more of the background references you start to fill in, the more Love and Death rewards you. Some is parody, some more like tribute. Scenes are recreated from Battleship Potemkin and Persona, music is lifted from Alexander Nevsky and the grim reaper makes an appearance after The Seventh Seal (but before Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey put the finishing touch on that joke). Pieces of classic Russian novels come into play directly (The Brothers Karamazov, War & Peace). The jokes run deeper still. Sergei Prokofiev is credited with music under S. Prokofiev to match Russian credit sequences. Woody and his father exchange dialogue which has been constructed entirely from Dostoyevsky titles. The level of immersion is incredible and complete... you could almost describe the film as a serious comedy. Allen even reprises himself; just as Diane Keaton sings the rebel song from 'Bananas' during 'Sleeper', we have throwbacks to the 'Bananas' dream sequence both in Woody being hoisted on a cross for a quick one-liner and in the dream of the coffins.Much of the comic interplay between Allen and Keaton carries through from 'Sleeper'; the scene of the pair posing at the door as Don Francisco and his sister recalls the operating theatre, but here they are taking on more weighty characters which allow the very genuine acting talents of both to emerge. Many of the set-pieces require precise timing, delivery and expression, and it is always delivered. Allen is a ball of nervous energy, but more focused than before. Keaton is freed from the idiot chains and plays the whole comic spectrum - her earnest deadpan delivery of parodies of the dense Russian prose are especially memorable. Supporting actors produce comedy gold too, whether it's James Tolkan's concerns about the British development of beef Wellington, Father Nikolai's sketches of Russian Jews, the soldier with the 'lock' of his wife's hair (Careful, don't drop it). In its rich tapestry of characters it almost becomes that which it parodies.Much of Love and Death was filmed in Budapest, other parts in Paris. Woody Allen is synonymous with New York, and this filming trip would be his last away from the Big Apple for more than 20 years. While in Budapest (which was occupied by the Red Army), he refused to drink the water and brought all of his own food and water, which enabled him to keep his feet when everyone else was stricken with dysentery. The weather continually worked against the shooting schedule, one of the actors had both legs broken in an accident, some negatives were destroyed and scenes had to be re-filmed. Many of the actors didn't speak English, which was necessary for much of the early humour; we have a whole family who are very eastern European in appearance and manner, and we have Woody as his anachronistic self.The danger in talking about this film for any length of time is that you will end up just listing off great scenes and jokes. Sleeper, as great as it is, was a slapstick comedy that occasionally had to be filled out to fill a feature-length slot. Here, we feel like everything has been condensed in order to squeeze down to a feature length, and that every joke, every sight gag, every parody is like the best selection from a larger selection; a greatest hits parade. Go, enjoy, and enjoy again - you won't be sorry you did.

This is as much Marx Brothers and Bob Hope as Tolstoy, Dovetsky, and Bergman. Woody has read War and Peace and is still angry for putting himself through it. But this spoof layers it on so thick that it is a juicy joy to behold. It is deliriously deep as well as silly and ridiculous. It is more fun than it ought to be considering that most of the literary references will go unnoticed. It is a hilariously profound and prickly Picture. The Genius here is that there literally is no time to contemplate the contemplations.An overlooked aspect of the Film is just how good it looks. Woody Allen is never mentioned as a great Director of Cinematography because, frankly, it matters little in most of his work. But here it is quite impressive.

It opens with 'Boris' ( Allen ) in a cell awaiting execution. What circumstances brought him to this predicament? The film goes into flashback mode. Boris is in love with 'Sonja' ( Diane Keaton ), his beautiful cousin, but she prefers his brother 'Ivan', whom Boris claims cannot even write his own name in the ground with a stick. He is then caught up in the Napoleonic Wars ( we kill Frenchmen, they kill Russians, before you know it, its Easter! ), and against the odds, becomes a hero, seducing a beautiful countess ( Olga Georges-Picot ). He finally marries Sonja, but it is not a happy union, although she manages to make some wonderful dishes out of snow. Sonja then comes up with her grand master plan - the assassination of Napoleon Bonaparte...As with his other films of this period, most of the gags have a strong Marx Brothers flavour, along with anachronisms such as Boris and a gang of cheerleaders suddenly appearing on the battlefield, along with a hot-dog vendor. There is a duelling sequence which one can imagine might have worked for Harpo Marx. Keaton, as ever, is excellent. Her meaningless discussions with Boris over the futility of human existence are priceless. Boris is agnostic; If only I could see a miracle...if only God would just cough!. My favourite moment is Boris quoting from the Bible Yay, I will walk through the valley in the shadow of death...come to think, I will RUN through through the valley in the shadow of death...you get out the valley quicker that way!. 'Love & Death' ends with the sight of Boris and the Grim Reaper dancing through trees. It is easy to see the scene now as symbolically bringing to a close this era of Woody Allen movies. He was smart to make the change when he did as the television show 'Saturday Night Live' was about to unleash a new wave of comedians - such as Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, and Dan Ackroyd - who went on to define 80's American film comedy.

With films like Sleeper and Love and Death, Allen uses particular contexts and settings to show how his outlook on life is as universal as human beings themselves. No longer set in the dystopian future, Allen shifts to 19th-century Russia as famous writers such as Tolstoy and Dostoevsky during the backdrop of the War of 1812 and serfdom.This is fertile ground for comic opportunity and Allen certainly makes the best of it. His signature stand-up routine finds many victims here and there are some very funny one-liners. Yet, what seems to be even more striking is how much stride Allen made visually between this film and his previous, Sleeper (1973). There is much better cinematography here as well as more striking images, such as the battle scenes and the image of Death moving across an open field. It is obvious Allen was quickly assimilating himself as a filmmaker and it would but 2 years before going on a run very few directors can match. Despite some imperfections, Love and Death is classical Woody Allen bizarre, morbid, thought-provoking and very funny. "},{"Title":"Brilliant satire.

All the strengths he was gathering as a filmmaker came together in this brilliant satire of (among other things) 19th century Russian literature, war, epic films about war, Ingmar Bergman, etc. etc. It's very very smart, and very very funny.An amazing mix of sophisticated intellectual verbal comedy, parody, low and high-brow visual gags (from speeded up film of bopping a character repeatedly over the head with a bottle, to homages to great images from early Russian films) , terrific cinematography, and some real ideas, both political and philosophical. Diane Keaton is wonderful, and fully comes into her own as Allen's on screen equal partner. And the look of the film shows the deep visual sophistication that would become a hallmark of the next phase of Allen's career; Annie Hall, Manhattan, etc. With this film Allen completed his journey from brilliant joke teller to brilliant director-writer. It would be his next film, Annie Hall, that would make the world realize he was a world class filmmaker. But you can see the all groundwork laid here, and have a lot of fun in the process.It's shocking to me that as of this writing, the DVD seems to be out-of-print in the U.S. I can only assume that's a temporary situation, but you might want to try and grab a copy now, just in case.

He is in love with Sonja (Diane Keaton), a woman with whom he can discuss philosophies while also admiring her great beauty. And, what with being set in Czarist Russia, there's also some talk of politics and a pesky, little man named Napoleon (played by someone fans of Back To The Future will no doubt recognise).Once again, at this stage in his career, Allen was using the movies as very loose skeletons upon which he could hang loads of gags and shoehorn in as many chuckles as possible. And he does it brilliantly. Wit, intelligence and music from Prokofiev alongside numerous great comedic performances make this yet another worthy viewing choice from his filmography.See this if you like Bananas, Sleeper, Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life. "},{"Title":"As empty experiences go, it's one of the best.","Date":"18 May 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, War","Review":" It's always interesting to observe Woody Allen in his various early, funny movies. In the period beginning with 'Take the Money and Run (1969) and ending with 'Annie Hall (1977)' &#150; a major turning point in both his film-making and how his talents were perceived by the public &#150; we can see the director's work growing in maturity and intelligence. In 'Bananas (1971)' just several years earlier, Allen had melded an assortment of random gags into something of a political satire; many of the jokes worked, some didn't, and the resultant film was a funny, if bewildering, anarchic comedy with a clumsy narrative structure. With 'Sleeper (1973),' Allen looked towards the future, and his dystopic vision of a society gone haywire provided a comfortable combination of witty dialogue and nostalgic slapstick humour, even if some sequences retained touches of juvenility. 'Love and Death (1975)' is the most profound of his transition comedies, and, in the classy setting of nineteenth century Russia, the comedian delivers his thoughts on life, death, God, war and sex &#150; but mostly sex.'Love and Death (1975)' was obviously produced shortly after an Ingmar Bergman marathon, and the film is both an affectionate homage and an enjoyable spoof of 'The Seventh Seal (1957),' Bergman's memorable meditation on the nature of religion and death. The perfect bittersweet ending sees Death, cloaked in a white sheet, leading our hero in a Danse Macabre across the countryside. Also targeted by Allen's razor-sharp flair for parody are the epic Russian novels of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and War and Peace. A singularly-absurd recreation of the Battle of Waterloo, which &#150; among other anachronisms &#150; is catered by a New York hot-dog vendor, is also an amusing send-up of Sergei Bondarchuk's impressive box-office disaster 'Waterloo (1970),' and even Bonaparte himself makes a surprise appearance as both an assassination target, and to demand the completion of the pastry to be named in his honour.Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, in their third of many collaborations, work together perfectly as cousins (and later partners) who like to bicker endlessly about the meaning of life, their conversations descending swiftly into dubious pseudo-philosophical ramblings of which I was able to make neither head nor tail. With the exception of one bottle gag that wouldn't have been out of place in a Chaplin film, most of the humour is purely verbal, and Allen even experiments with breaking the fourth wall, a style of comedy that he would implement with astonishing success in 'Annie Hall.' In terms of story, 'Love and Death,' in spite of its episodic nature, comes together more completely than any of Allen's previous films, and the jokes are consistently funny enough to draw a laugh. Considerably funnier than that other famous historical comedy released in 1975 (if I may be so bold), this is one of Woody Allen's funniest movies, with more than enough intelligent humour to go around.

But in the beginning, there is a great divergence between the horrors depicted and the way Allen shows them to us. The first situation which gets that out of order (and which gets us really to think) is the strange dream scene. But the real wonder of the film is how weirdest kamikaze-humour and deep truth slowly manage to find together. In the end, truth has come into everything (look at the great scene with Sonja and Natasha at the end), and the final scene is unparalleled in its relaxed way of meeting death - Love and Death are meeting in that incredible totally chilled gray-blue tones of the winter landscape and Allen dancing across the final border (and Prokofiev's wonderful music).

Boris Grushenko (Allen) is the weakest and most cowardly brother in his Russian family. He falls in love with Sonja (Keaton), his twice-removed cousin who is his intellectual and spiritual equal, but is actually in love with one of Boris' brothers. When Boris is forced to go to war during the Napoleonic invasion of Russia, he still pines for Sonja, who in turn ends up marrying an elderly gentleman who she isn't in love with, but becomes the village tramp by sleeping with most of the men in it. Through an act of serendipity (he hides in a cannon and ends up killing a major figure on the enemy side) Boris becomes a decorated hero and marrying Sonja, whose husband has died. Together, the two plot to assassinate Napoleon in order to rid war from their country.The plot summary sounds fairly straightforward, but of course, being a Woody Allen film, (particularly one of his 1970's films) it was utterly hilarious. It is so hard to describe why Allen's comedy is so endearing and successful, but I know that a big part of it is its intelligence &#150; even when we are experiencing slapstick humor and seemingly lowbrow moments, there is still an enormous amount of cleverness to it. Allen peppers the film with homages to various Bergman films, which seem so arbitrary to anyone that doesn't know their source that it's almost like a delicious inside joke. Keaton and Allen are an amazing on screen couple who have such stunning intellectual chemistry that it kind of seems a shame he had to go through his whole Mia Farrow phase in film-making. (Though Hannah and her Sisters is probably his best film of the 80's) Granted, I am a Woody Allen fan, but I also know when he has made some crap films. Luckily, he didn't make any of those in the 1970's, and Love and Death in particular is one that should definitely be seen. Any film that contains the line, Granted, I have a few eccentricities.

I have just revisited this film after 20-odd years and still like it.The terrific ideas are many.  From the ha-ha humour section for example, the scene where the Russian soldiers are practicing formation charging is a classic, as is the scene at the opera where Woody flirts with the Countess, as is the scene where Diane Keaton flirts while her herring-merchant husband appears to be taking a herring upstairs to bed with him......... There is also the parody/pastiche section - all those Bergman references (I got far more of them this time than I did the first time round) and the Eisenstein parody using Alexander Nevsky as the music is great.On the cringe-making side, the literature references did not always work for me - the dialogue which throws in every Dostoevsky title under the sun is a little sophomoric for my taste.

If anything it reminds me most in tone to how Allen used to write in his short fiction and little bits he contributed to magazines and books. The comedy is both verbal and physical, and its probably that one film that connects him from those earlier films of the 70s into the more personal realm he would dive into in the late 70s and beyond. It's light comedy even as it deals with Death (both with a capital and lower case d), murder, war, hunger, the struggles of love and marriage, religion, politics, and other penchants of Russian literature. It mixes this up to an effect that isn't 100% successful, but does keep me laughing on repeat viewings.Allen's character Boris Grushenko goes through an epic story at first having to face Death itself as a child (great homage to Bergman, not the first for the filmmaker), then he goes into a War he (of course, being the usual Allen character) doesn't want to go into, but does, and comes out alive somehow. He marries his cousin Sonja (Diane Keaton, one of her funniest performances), to her dismay as she doesn't love him- at first. When she realizes so, it is then into the biggest chunk of the film, as she plots for Boris to assassinate Napoleon. There's almost an overload of some classic Allen quips and puns and other gags, and sometimes as Boris and Sonja break into philosophical discussions, Allen mocks this to the point where you can't help but laugh. I didn't totally get this joke that happens more than once in Love & Death, until I read some Dostoyevsky, and then it clicked further. One particularly funny bit is when Allen's Boris writes the 'ragged claws scuttling across the floor' line. But there are almost too many to list here. The key is that there are enough so that at least some can stick even if one or two are a little cheesy thirty years later. But its hard not to bust a gut as Allen has a talk in close-up with the audience as Napoleon's knocked out.It's a movie with a gleeful way about it as Allen Lampoons many of the most dramatic points, either real or written about or fictionalized, in that time of 19th century European/Russian history. It's a parody, but not one overloaded with dirty jokes like a Mel Brooks movie. And it's another showcase for Allen and Keaton's perfect on screen chemistry, as she shows her own comic chops, usually playing it straight or with some goofiness. I love the musical choices too.

The setting is the time of the Napoleonic wars, and the sets and costumes are often opulent, sometimes reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago. Woody seems to feel that a combination of Chaplinesque physical comedy and his own brew of one-liners is the perfect antidote to the introspective, world-weary dialogs of some of the heroes of Russian fiction. Allen keeps the pace very fast-- so fast that anyone familiar with Russian novels hardly has time to savor any of his gags before the next one comes tumbling in. As usual, Woody plays his ubiquitous cowardly persona, while Keaton plays the object of what passes for affection on his part. Their dialogs are a hilarious lampoon of serious philosophy, mouthing lines about the nature of being in a perfect verbal burlesque. Allen seems to think that the way to Keaton's libido is through her intellect; for her, libido and Allen are mutually exclusive phenomena throughout most of this romp. Keaton's character runs through a whole catalog of Russian heroines, skewering each of them with her unsentimental matter-of-factness. In such a nihilistic farce, Love and Death seem to be quite interchangeable, and it's hard to say which comes out ahead.

Not funny/serious, like Annie Hall, which may be his best film ever, but at times hilarious.Allen and Diane Keaton, who plays his distant cousin, are Russians during the Napoleonic era. The climax is their attempt to assassinate Napoleon after he captures Moscow.The plot is ridiculous and encompasses the war, the tangled love affairs, duels, the tendency in Russian novels towards philosophizing and brooding about God, the distinction between aristocrats and serfs. It borrows heavily from Dostoyevsky and especially Tolstoy's War and Peace. Its cinematic touchstones are Sergei Eisenstein and Ingmar Bergman -- some shots parody exactly the images from both.There are too many jokes to list, and it would be a bad idea to even think about it. I'll direct the viewer's attention to two.(1) Allen and Keaton attempt to knock out the Ambassador from Spain by hitting him over the head with a wine bottle. The Ambassador is alerted at the last moment. What follows is a speeded-up silent comedy shtick in which Allen and Keaton try to convince the Ambassador that it was just a game. The illustrate the game by hitting each other over the head with the bottle and laughing as they do so. No music, just a CLUNK each time the bottle lands on somebody's head.(2) Allen is about to be executed but receives a message from God that the Emperor will spare him at the last moment. This sends him into an epiphany in which he looks heavenward and recites a soliloquy about the meaning of life and the prophecies from the Bible. He's carrying on with banalities about how the wicked man will be delivered into the hands of his enemies. The spotlight on him is extinguished but he adds quickly, Wait, not yet! I'm not done with the wicked man. It skewers a number of sacred cows, God and the belief in an afterlife among them.Some of the wisecracks fall a little flat but there are scenes and set pieces that lift it far above most comedies of the decade. He flirts with the paramour of a marksman and is challenged to a duel. The challenge should be to the viewer Try not to laugh.

As example, as a Woody Allen fan I'd watched his terrific 1975 satire Love And Death, filmed in Hungary and France, probably ten or twelve times, fully getting all the references to Fyodor Dostoevsky's and Leo Tolstoy's works, but I had never been in the position of viewing the film having knowledge of all the sly European cinema references; especially those which poke fun at Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's canon.Love And Death was the last 'purely comedic' Woody Allen film before he entered his great Golden Age, starting with 1977's Annie Hall and ending with 1992's Husbands And Wives. It was a romp, or as one of the aliens in 1980's Stardust Memories said, 'We enjoy your films. Particularly the early, funny ones.' It was also a great showcase of his comedic talents in synch with those of Diane Keaton. No other foil- male nor female, has ever come close to the chemistry that duo exhibited. Of course, like almost all his films, Allen wrote, as well as directed this film. and it represented a step up from his earlier works, like Bananas, Take The Money And Run, or Sleeper&#133;. The film succeeds and holds relevance today because its references and humor are timeless, but also because it works whether you get the references or not. Thus, it is both low and high comedy, and no one has ever done that better than Woody Allen- be it getting shot out of a canon, or psychobabbling with Diane Keaton over objectivity vs. subjectivity. Yes, it is not as deep and alternately hilarious as later Allen masterpieces like Hannah And Her Sisters or Crimes And Misdemeanors, but it is every bit as enjoyable, and that's more than can be said for the bulk of films out there.

Nyet. I don't know my Dostoevski from my Tolstoy, and for years I thought the Brothers Karamazov were a family of Soviet trapeze artists, but that did not stop Love and Death from leaping straight to the top of my list of alltime favourite films.Made in 1975 (I've always thought Allen's best work was done in the Seventies), it is the story of a cowardly Russian who (very) accidentally becomes a war hero. It is the early 1800's and Russia is at war with Napoleonic France. Allen is Boris Grushenko, the youngest of three brothers in a rural family. Madly in love with Sonia, his cousin twice removed, played by a luminous Diane Keaton, he would rather philosophise and write poetry, but is instead drafted into the army. During the height of battle he hides in a cannon. The cannon is fired and he becomes a human cannonball who happens to land on a tent killing several French generals. He becomes the toast of Moscow, desired by beautiful women and reviled by their jealous lovers. But always in the back of his mind is his cousin Sonia. He even keeps a lock of her husband's hair to remind him of her. She is trapped in a loveless marriage to a herring obsessed businessman, and she has many affairs. They eventually find each other but just when life seems perfect she hatches a plan to assasinate Napoleon.If truth be told, any review of this comic gem would only do it scant justice. One has to see it to really appreciate the humour. It has sight gags aplenty, but also some marvellous dialogue. I also loved the incongruity of Allen's New York accent juxtapositioned against the perfect Russian accents of the supporting cast. There are many memorable scenes, highlights for me being the Black Russian drill sergeant, the verbal exchanges between Allen and Harold Gould, and the meeting between the real and the fake Napoleons.Prior to the success of Annie Hall, Allen's films were generally made with a limited budget, but this was no hindrance in this film. There was good costume design and lovely cinematography. I also enjoyed the use of composer Sergei Prokofiev's music to score the film.A sheer joy from beginning to end Love and Death is a lively and hilarious comedy to be savoured again and again.

In the film Allen plays Boris, a weak coward who is too scared to fight in the war but once forced to he accidentally becomes a hero. Back at home he finally admits his love for his distant cousin (Diane Keaton) and the two come up with a plot to assassinate Napoleon. There's no doubt that Allen was on an extremely high point in his career and one that would continue to get even better over the next couple films. LOVE AND DEATH is certainly one of his most unusual films but there's no denying it's pure comic madness as we get one very funny sequence after another. While everyone knows about this spoofing Russian literature, another point that often gets overlooked is how the screenplay seems to be paying homage to the Marx Brothers as well. Throughout the picture you can just see Allen delivering and saying certain lines as if he was in a Marx Brothers movie and you can almost see Harpo and Chico being able to pull these lines off as well. One of the strongest aspects of the film is the terrific screenplay that really fires off one terrific line as another. It's somewhat hard to put your finger on one great sequence because the movie really builds up on small moments. One of the funniest lines in the film has to do with the Keaton character's cheating with a countless number of men and when Allen asks if she's almost done naming them she answers no because she's still in the names starting with A. Another very funny gag deals with Allen's father who carries around the land that he owns. It goes without saying but Allen is perfect in the role as no one can say his lines better than himself. Even better is how great Keaton is and as you'd expect the two stars have a lot of chemistry together and really nail the material. It's funny because Allen and Keaton are so wonderful together yet they often get overlooked when people discuss great comedy teams. The film doesn't stop at Russian jokes as the French get a few hits and there are even some obvious nods to Ingmar Bergman. Of all the Allen-Keaton films, this one here is probably the one that's most overlooked because of the subject matter but if people give it a chance they'll see how special it really is.

Is there a God and does He care about us? What is love? Are moral standards absolute? In Love and Death Woody Allen relies more on physical (as opposed to cerebral) comedy than he does in his Annie Hall and subsequent masterpieces. For example, Boris being accidentally shot from a cannon and weapons that break when Boris tries to use them. There are plenty of individual Monte Python quality comic bits, but that kind of comedy has for me by now lost what edge it once had. Much of comedy comes from the unsuspecting audience being surprised by the punch line. Of his early films that use a lot of physical comedy, I recall really liking Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex. I haven't seen it in decades (perhaps not since it was first released) and wonder if its humor still works today? However, some of the shticks in Love and Death still feel fresh, such as the comically attired Angel of Death, and the messages that newly dead people give to our protagonist. Some of the physical comedy bits, such as Boris being accidentally shot from a cannon, reminded me of Buster Keaton.

However, in this film we see SOME of his previous silliness but it is now combined with references to Russian literature that only Russians, intellectuals and pseudo-intellectuals would understand. For the first time, he shows that he is beginning to lose his audience--his regular fans. References to Uncle Vanya, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy will no doubt go right over the heads of fans who were used to a different brand of humor. While the film is NOT devoid of laughs, they are fewer and the overall message from Allen seems to be wow--I'm funny AND an intellectual. I guess I'm not an intellectual, then.

It is even worse than his early efforts Take the Money and run and Bananas. The slapstick is excruciating. Allen trips over his rifle when he marches and gooses women with his sword when he bows. The verbal humour is even thinner. One can only imagine that Allen was taking an evening class in philosophy at the time he wrote the script; some of the supposedly funny verbal exchanges between Boris and Sonia could have been lifted straight from his philosophy homework. Allen returns more successfully to the Russian novel as inspiration in Crimes and Misdemeanours. The moral anguish over whether to kill one man, Napoleon, for the good of many foreshadows similar themes in Crimes and Misdemeanours and Bullets Over Broadway but the treatment here is very immature.

Before I drown in indignant e-mails from Allen fans, let me make a few comments. The aforementioned Allen fans always smugly say that those who don't rave over Allen's films are Philistines who just don't get it. Well, I do get it. It just isn't very funny. Yeah, I caught the references to Tolstoy, and was mildly amused by the riff working in all of the titles of Dosteyevsky's books, and the mention of Raskolnikov. Allen's humor is wry and absurdist, and was something different when he first hit the scene. But it is all the same. Allen always plays Allen, basing everything on his New York, Jewish angst. And of course his vanity knows no bounds, in spite of this persona. Seeing nothing wrong with porking his (more or less) stepdaughter is Exhibit A on this. Unless you are a fan of Allen, or want to seem to be, skip this one. "}]
