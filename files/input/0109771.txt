It's similar in many ways to Amadeus. Like Amadeus, it has glorious music beautifully performed. Like Amadeus, it tells a good (if melodramatic) story. Like Amadeus, it has a marvelous period feel. Like Amadeus, the characters in this story have the names and occupations of real people, but their portrayal on the screen is not even caricature a caricature necessarily starts with something recognizeable.Farinelli was famous in history not merely for a phenomenal voice and outstanding musicianship and musical connoisseurship, but for poise, dignity, and perfect-pitch judgement of human character; he is portrayed throughout as a hysteric. Handel is shown as a pompous, bullying nervous wreck verging on the psychotic, quite at variance with all reliable accounts of his humor, sturdiness, practicality, and reputation for scrupulous probity toward his musicians and singers.Handel could not have said, to Farinelli, during the latter's first sensational season with the Opera of the Nobility, that he would never write another opera, and not just because Handel was no faux-Freudian opera queen Lady History inconveniently discloses that after that 1733-34 season Handel composed and presented Ariodante, Alcina, Atalanta, Giustino, Arminio, Berenice, Faramondo, Serse, and Imeneo; his last opera, Deidamia, went unperformed, but several in that list were significant successes, and some were revived more than once.The two rival opera companies in London went down the drain more or less simultaneously, notwithstanding the enormous draw of Farinelli for the Nobility company, and notwithstanding the high quality of the music of its principal composers (Porpora, Hasse, undervalued today) and the stupendous quality of Handel's music (also undervalued); rather, the people with the money to afford the (by our standards) enormous ticket prices had simply lost interest.One commentator here is skeptical about many period details. And rightly for starters, that's not the way boys were castrated, but you don't need to know the truth. Relax, just enjoy the music and the costumes and the actors chewing the scenery.

The foreign film, mixed Italian and French, retells the story of the famous and greatest castrato singer Carlo Broschi. The film is exotic, intensely emotional and loaded with beautiful music of the Baroque Era (1600-1750). With all the good things about this movie, comes some things that might be rather disturbing or inappropriate for a younger audience. This is assuredly an adult film. There are two explicit sex scenes at the beginning and end of the film. This is a movie for an adult who is interested in the period, in the life of the castrati and in opera at this time. The opening introduces Carlo Broschi as a little boy singing in the church choir. Another young lad has been castrated to preserve his voice and is so mortified he leaps to his death. Eventually Carlo's brother Riccardo is obligated to do the same to his brother. We don't learn until later in the film that it was Riccardo and not Carlos' brother that conducted the castration. Here, Farinelli is usually quite ill and is forced to take opium as medicine. Farinelli does not seem to think highly of his brother's operas, which are written exclusively for his voice. Instead, he believes the greatest composer of this time is George Frederic Handel, played convincingly by Jerome Krabbe. In a dinner party, in which the Nobles insult Handel, Farinelli is outraged and declares that Handel will long be remembered and not the Nobles and their operas. This ends up being true since Handel is considered one of the greatest composers of this period together with Johann Sebastian Bach. The movie has some inaccuracies and are not historically true. Naturally, this being a costume drama, there are some elements which were entirely fictional created for the sake of sensationalism. Although it is true Riccardo Broschi did compose operas for his brother Farinelli, there is no real evidence they shared the women they bedded. In the movie, a Countess is so enamored with Farinelli that she jumps into bed with him only to discover he's castrated. Thus, Riccardo plants the seed and Farinelli only lures the women into bed and seduces them. This is fabricated material to sex up the movie. In real life, Farinelli I'm inclined to believe was chaste. He sung many times for religious services and was a devout Catholic. He may not have been at all bitter for his castration since he lived like a king all his life, surrounded in luxury. He was well acquainted with European royalty, all of Europe loved him and he died after years of singing in the chambers of King Phillip of Spain. The rivalry between the Nobles Theatre Opera and Handel's opera company is true. In fact, it remains the only true thing about this movie. The English in London disliked the German foreigner Handel and his prominence in London. He was so beloved that even King George and Queen Anne protected him. The Nobles schemed endlessly to get rid of Handel. The portrayal of Handel as a musical genius, a man of stubborn, perfectionist character is all true. I think the most moving scenes are those with Handel, such as the scene in which Farinelli is overhearing him play the organ in the church and is moved by the music and the scene of Farinelli singing Lascio Chio Pianga from Rinaldo which ultimately moves Handel to tears. All the scenes of opera and Farinelli singing in his majestic costumes in this movie are stunningly beautiful. Finally, this movie's soundtrack is incredible. It contains the combined voices of tenor Derek Rogin and soprano Ewa Mallas as the singing voice of Farinelli. The arias sung here are taken from Riccardo Broschi's operas Idaspe and Artaserse and from Handel's Julius Caesar and Rinaldo. A superb film and a must see for fans of Baroque opera.

The story line at first left me wondering why the director had chosen to make the film in the first place. Luscious scenery, beautiful costumes, sets, extravagant, but historically accurate stagings for the opera scenes, great language and dialogue - but why make a film about an all but forgotten singer from almost three centuries ago? Nothing in the film seemed to give a clue as to why anyone would go to all the bother of reconstructing a marvelous voice so painstakingly, and choose one of the great performers of our time to oversee the performances of the music. Repeated viewings did not seem to throw any light on the vexing question that, despite all the lushness and splendour I was still missing some point to the whole exercise. It was only on the third or fourth viewing that I noticed in the opening credits a small remark - in French - to the memory of my daughter . . name. Suddenly the whole thing made sense. This marvelous and true story of the castrato is, perhaps, the directors attempt to describe his impotence in the face of the loss of his beloved child. Viewed in this light the ending of the film and the sequences in London between Farinelli and Benedict finally begin to have a poignancy and a sadness that is truly stunningly and sensitively achieved whilst adding to the story line. I love this film and cannot possibly recommend it enough. Any lover of Early Music should revel in it, but it has been lifted out of the ordinary and into the universal and sublime by that one small realization. Superlatives cannot do it justice.

This 17-18th c. period was, until recent times, skirted over by musicologists and music history teachers.The result of this omission has been an unsuspecting awareness of the extent to which male performers dominated all forms of period theater, including opera, oratorio, cantata, ballet, and stage plays. Ferinneli had an opportunity to provide substantive information in filling this void.Unfortunately, what resulted is just another Ken Russell-type production (a la The Music Lovers, Lisztomania, Mahler, etc.).  In fact, were Andre Corbiau's name not credited as director of Ferinelli, one would swear this was a Russell composer biopic.All Russell trademarks are there excessive closeups of actors in dramatic distress, swirling activity to cover up script weaknesses, and disjointed highlights instead of sequence continuity.Director-coscriptor Corbiau has Stefano Dionisi as Ferinneli forever falling down and collapsing both on and offstage for no apparent reason, and using the old device of having him hesitate to sing on cue before a full house to superficially create suspense and anxiety.In fact, Corbiau, like Russell, is more intent on affecting than expressing manipulating the viewer than sincerely sharing.  As a result, one is held a arm's length of emotional participation throughout.While no contemporary production can create a truly authentic period setting, there are questions which arise here George Frederick Handel, one of the world's most prolific and fine composers, is reduced to that of a mere rival theatrical impressario; and Farinelli is forever acting oddly--claiming vocal loss, serious indisposition, and tripping out on opium.  Indeed, at times this seems more like a baroque version of sex-drugs-and-rock-'n'roll.On the brighter side, the staging of the operatic scenes are wonderfully on-target, having been obviously well-researched and meticulously designed. The combination real-and-computer-created vocal work is fascinating in its etherial timbre and in its negotiation of Handelean melismas, embellishments and assorted ornamentation. Likewise, the baroque pit orchestra and period opera house decor is strikingly detailed.What a pity Farinelli fails in its main opportunity to convey a simple, heart-felt story of one of history's most celebrated singers.

Mid-film scenes set against the decadence of 17th-century European court life make for charming costumes and sets. Contrasting visuals of rural Italy provide their own pastoral allure that is no less charming.  Moreover, the film rises admirably to the daunting technical and artistic task of reproducing the tone of a castrato voice, considering that the musical world has not seen or heard a castrato singer for more than a century.'Ah,' you say, 'sounds gorgeous...but what's it about?' Enter Carlo and Riccardo Broschi, Italian brothers who share musical aspirations Riccardo composes, and Carlo sings what he writes. Carlo is a gifted castrato, but Riccardo is a mediocre composer at best.  In time, Carlo becomes the renowned Farinelli while Riccardo struggles with his lack of talent/recognition as well as the troublesome fact that Carlo is his meal ticket.The simple story line masks rich potential (think 'Amadeus'), but 'Farinelli' is hampered by shallow character development and its inexplicable tendency to substitute all-too-frequent sex scenes for emotional power.  Without the full realization of the characters or the ramifications of the plot, the film struggles to keep a viewer engaged, at least in my own case.  The beautiful pageantry of 'Farinelli' fails to compensate for its hollow dramatic core.In short? Not bad, but a better music movie is 'Amadeus'(among others), and a better movie with beautiful Italian visuals is 'A Room With A View' (among others).

This 1994 Belgian film is an opulent production full of stunning costumes and set decorations, but director Gerard Corbiau is far more focused on the co-dependency between two real-life brothers, Carlo Broschi, the swoon-worthy castrato known to the world as Farinelli, and his marginally talented composer brother Riccardo. Although there are glimpses of the castration that occurred when Carlo was ten, the narrative deals very little with the psychological anguish of this act, instead showing extravagantly vainglorious scenes of Farinelli's impact on audiences at the time. It's as if the story structure of the Baroque operas written at that time took over the sensibility of the screenplay and trivialized the human complexities into exaggerated melodrama.Despite a valiant effort by Stefano Dionisi in the title role, Farinelli is portrayed as a moody, self-centered egotist rather than a misunderstood artist. Compounding the problem is the fact that his masculine speaking voice is at odds with his ethereal singing voice (obviously a creative decision so as not to alienate the general audience from the character's plight). Moreover, the computerized melding of countertenor Derek Lee Ragin and soprano Ewa Mallas Godlewska into Farinelli's voice simply does not sync up well with Dionisi's lip and throat movements. In other words, you simply don't believe it's Dionisi's voice coming out of him. When the film finally takes flight in the last third of the film, it's because the focus has shifted to the competitive, intense relationship between Farinelli and the great composer of the age, Handel. Jeroen Krabbe - familiar to American audiences for his nasty turn as Barbra Streisand's condescending husband in The Prince of Tides - plays Handel with such passionate fury that I wish the film was more about his character. This sequence climaxes with the film's musical highlight, a trio of wonderful, truly classic arias from Handel's Rinaldo.Unfortunately, the remaining musical performances are not nearly as absorbing and rather repetitive. The film again flails toward the end when we are given a rather silly scene involving a solar eclipse and gratuitous nudity with a ménage a trois among Farinelli, Riccardo and Alexandra, the woman who is - quite literally - between them. The remaining performances are fine with Enrico LoVerso conveying his Salieri-like inferiority with appropriate fervor, Elsa Zylberstein beguiling as Alexandra and Caroline Cellier doing a fine Jeanne Moreau impersonation as the jaded Margareth Hunter. Overall it's still a relatively disappointing movie saved by Handel's musical genius. Except for a few trailers, there are no extras with the DVD. For those interested in the world of the castrati in more penetrating detail, I suggest reading Anne Rice's 1982 novel, Cry to Heaven, and the Rinaldo arias are better served by countertenor David Daniels and mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli on their 2002 cast recording conducted by Christopher Hogwood.

He had the voice of an angel when he was a boy and since his family was very poor, an operation of castration was done to him in order to preserve his voice and help his family out in poverty.  There were some strange parts during this film such as when he got older he and his brother Riccardo traveled together and never left each other.  His brother was there during Farinelli's lovemaking in order to complete and finish the task that his brother could not do since he had been castrated.  And then there was the white horses that Farinelli saw every time danger was present or near. This warning was not clearly explained in the film.  The acting was very good.  I enjoyed the variation of languages of French and Italian with a little bit of English thrown in.  The costumes were excilent and the way the actors portrayed the characters during that past time period were done good. One makes you feel sorry for Farinelli because of what he did lack and also makes you feel for him because everybody would make a specticle of him because of his castration and the fact that he could not complete the task of lovemaking (personally..... I do not think that he really needed that, he was good being his own person anyway).  Farinelli's popularity had worn down during the middle of his career due to his excessive use of opium in which his brother provided for him in order for him to sleep and get rid of any pain or stress.  During the end of the movie we find that it is Riccardo that turned his little brother in because of his ability to sing and thus help his poor familiy.  Not much is mentioned of his familiy but in the beginnig of the movie we do know that his family was poor and Farinelli offered himself as well as his voice because his voice was all that he did have in order to stay alive.  This movie was a good film and I give it about a 7.  There were several parts in the film that were not clearly explained and that was the only flaw.

It was as if the filmmakers did not think that the beautiful music and sumptuous settings could carry the film. I don't know if something was lost in the subtitling, or whether too much film was left on he cutting room floor, but I was baffled by a number of the characters. Who was Benjamin and why did he wear a body brace? Who were Alexandra and Margareth? The characters simply seemed to be a device to move the story along to the bizarre and unnecessary sex scenes.My biggest problem was with the poor lip synching, which was so obvious that it distracted and spoiled the flow of the film. It was not just that the facial mannerisms did not match the voice, but that the volume actually dropped to the extent that the voice seemed to be coming from off stage. Nowhere was this worse than the trumpet scene at the beginning. The castrati had very powerful voices, but Farinelli's voice sounds like a far-off squeak. Synching has been done very successfully in the past, most notably by Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady and Ava Gardner is Show Boat, and most famously by Edmund Purdom in the Student Prince, so it should not be beyond the capability of film makers 40 or more years later. I felt that the film would have been more convincing if Farinelli had been played by a soprano doing her own singing, and had concentrated more on the relationship with the brother who was riding on Farinelli's coat tails. How often have we seen a partnership where one half is nothing without the other, and knows it.As for the comparison with the decadent rock star life style, that is how the castrati stars allegedly lived in the hedonistic 18th-century. I am not sure either that the castrati strutted around the stage like drag queens as they were supposed to be playing the women's parts as women. Given Ken Russell’s record of appallingly bad taste portrayals of musicians, it is surprising that he never attempted this one. It was right up his street.

There is a strange fascination with the idea of the castrato, so I found myself watching the movie to learn more about castrati. However, the film romanticized Farinelli like a rock star or something. Some scenes were pretty damn embarrassing. But before I go into all that, here's a grossly brief spiel of castrato history, drawn from M401 music history class at IU and from various websites found from Google, and NOT FROM THE FILM, in order to give some background info During the 18th century in Rome and some other Italian areas, women were not permitted to sing in church. For this reason, boys between the ages of 7-9 who showed potential as a singer were castrated to preserve their unbroken voice, with their permission. Although castrati were common throughout Italy, the procedure was illegal even then. Opera was the most popular and extravagant genre of music at this time, and castrati were often cast as the lead male role. Audiences found the unnatural voice of the castrati quite hypnotic, combining the range of a woman with the strength and power of a man. Carlo Broschi, called Farinelli, remains the highest esteemed of the castrati. Tales include his 3-octave-plus range, and of numerous occasions at the opera house where he would compete with a trumpeter on who could hold a note longer, with Farinelli winning. Physically, castrati were described to be abnormally tall, with a pear-shaped torso (wide hipped). Their voices sounded like a woman's. They had no facial hair, and no male-pattern baldness. And of course, most (though not all) were celibate. Farinelli was like most, I'm pretty sure (don't quote me on that).Now, the film is a bit different from all this. In the film, Farinelli is an Italian Tom Cruise look-alike with a thin waist (like any thin sexy man). He's constantly having sex, sharing his fans with his leech brother. And, I'm no singer, but Mr. Stefano Dionisi did a pretty poor lip-sync job. His posture suggested no diaphragmatic support. Also, he made goofy facial expressions out of place in opera, and he also bared his teeth excessively. The diction and tone that his face suggested would have sounded really bad, for opera standards. Of course, I'm not expecting a MET performance from an actor, but his impersonation of operatic singing looked almost mocking. Also, the whole blending of male and female voice (see goofs above) lacked power. They should have just used a counter-tenor.Also, I am not aware of the relationship between Farinelli and his brother Riccardo, but I'm pretty sure it was not as dysfunctional and psychotic as it was made out to be. And there is no way that Farinelli's castration was such a big deal and an injustice to Farinelli. I'm sure he wanted to be castrated just like everyone else.The portrayal of Handel is a scream. I always thought Handel was a cosmopolitain man, who served the royalty of England and saw far more success than Bach. The movie portrays him as such, granted, but I didn't think he was a bastard! Maybe he was, I don't know, but the relationship and rivalry between Farinelli and Handel, I don't think that ever occurred. First off, Farinelli never performed any of Handel's operas. I doubt he stole his opera score too.Despite the historical inaccuracies, I found the portrayal of 18th century opera society to be really interesting. Typically, American audiences are used to historical movies with British actors, regardless of the ethnicity portrayed. We are used to seeing British people play Frenchmen, Italianmen. However, in this film, the French are played by Frenchmen, and so on. As a result, there seems to be a more realistic portrayal of European society. Also I love how the opera is just this excuse to socialize. It was not like it is today. In this sense, the film was more historically correct.All in all, I recommend seeing the film. Do a google search for pictures of Farinelli, if you're interested.

In fact, it is a blatantly convoluted tale that looks more like a Cinderella story than actual accounts of history. Director Gerard Corbiau's Farinelli is 'all that' but it also is visually stunning and represents castrati singing with richness and clarity. Farinelli is the artistic name of castrato (a male castrated at a young age) Carlo Broschi (Stefano Dionisi), a handsome young choir boy who was accidentally castrated at the age of 10 purportedly due to a riding accident. Ill and under the influence of powerful drugs (opium) at the time, Carlo has no recollection of his unfortunate accident. His brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso), seven years his senior, tells him repeatedly the story of how he was riding a beautiful white horse from which he was thrown, causing an injury that led to his castration. Throughout his life, Carlo has a recurring nightmare about riding the white horse but in his dream he never falls off. The conflict between Carlo's dreams and Riccardo's stories hints at the horrible secret between the brothers that is ultimately revealed near the end of the film. Carlo's astonishing soprano voice (a digitized composition of the voices of Derek Lee Ragin and Ewa Mallas Godlewska) eventually makes him and his brother who composes mediocre operatic scores for Carlo to perform, a phenomenal success. Carlo relinquishes his born name with his professional name Farinelli. Although Carlo suspects that his brother had something to do with his childhood emasculation, he continues to perform his brothers badly written operas. Both brothers are aware that Carlo's superior talent is being undermined by performing Riccardo's operas.An ill-fated meeting with Maestro George Frederick Handel (Jeroen Krabbé), who desired a contract with Carlo, begins a contentious battle between the two for the lion's share of audience. Carlo turns down Maestro Handel's offer is hired to perform in a London theater to draw audiences away from Handel's operas. Farinelli performs wonderfully and eventually takes virtually all of the audience away from Handel. Carlo's looks, fantastic voice, and range make female audience members faint dead away. One woman tells Carlo that he is responsible for her first musical orgasm! A pact between brothers where women are concerned creates titillating ménage a trios scenes which earned the film its R rating. Carlo soon realizes that performing Handel's operas are so desirable to him that he tries to convince Handel to take him in. The rest of the story reveals the tragic secret that Carlo has always known but in the end brings brothers together for one more ménage a trios that would leave Carlo to become a father; the one gift that was taken away from him as a child. I really enjoyed this film and the music that accompanied it. I commend the director for his efforts to take a difficult subject matter and turn it into a story that is both entertaining and titillating at times. However, the early-on innuendo that Riccardo was somehow responsible for Carlo's difficult life took away the endings potential climax that could have left the audience hanging. --Lewis Saettel 2007 "},{"Title":"Nicely filmed","Date":"2 May 2004","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  I was quite intrigued by the scenery in the film.

Just a few notes the ambiguous relationship between the Broschi brothers, the stormy one with rival composer Handel, and Farinelli's own amorous escapades and over-the-top rockstar attitude are totally spurious. But I don't think this makes the film bad, because it is not intended to be a true story.It is somewhat hard to believe that this used to be a real practice... the purposeful destruction of a child just to have him sing high notes.

This movie called  Farinelli  is the finest example of what was once deemed a most unique form of Opera. The story is based on the true story of two brothers who's father fettered them to a life of music and composition. Stefano Dionisi plays Carlo Broschi, AKA as Farinelli and his brother Riccardo Broschi (Enrico Lo Verso). Together they travel far and wide seeking not only an Opera loving audience, but also a rich patron who could afford their talent. The time of our story is set during the Baroque heyday of Frideric Handel (Jeroen Krabbe) who's great Classical music became the epitome of royalty and high society alike. The elder Broschi believes he did the right thing by suffering his younger brother to the excruciating pain of being castrated. However, he is then haunted by the fact his tortured brother has nightmares from the incident. Travel as the two boys do throughout the film, the story becomes more a testament of conscience, than one dealing with the audience appreciation of the day. Still, for Opera lovers or for those who enjoy good operatic theater, this movie delivers a cornucopia of both, with great period costumes and superior acting. Indeed, Stefano Dionisi and Jeroen Krabbé are superb as their lives play against each another. **** "},{"Title":"A Fascinating Glimpse Into A Very Different World Of Music","Date":"5 June 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" This movie has something of a kinship with Amadeus, portraying as it does the important cultural significance of music in a very different time and place - far more significant than music is today - but it's a much darker movie than Amadeus (which itself has some dark undertones.) The movie gives a glimpse into the life of Carlo Roschi (better known as Farinelli) - one of the great opera singers of the 18th century. Farinelli (played by Stefano Dionisi) was a castrato - castrated as a young boy in order to preserve his brilliant soprano voice. Admittedly, it's a bit off putting to see a male portrayed as singing soprano (I say portrayed, because I assume Dionisi was lip-synching, since we don't have castratos today.) But while Farinelli's singing was the centerpiece of the movie, what's really being portrayed here (and, from what I've been able to glean, not entirely accurately, although I'm no expert on 18th century opera singers!) are the complex relationships in Farinelli's life - especially his relationship with his brother Riccardo (Enrico Lo Verso.) Carlo was the brilliant singer; Riccardo seems to have been a rather average composer - but, trying to keep a promise made to their father, they work as a team. The relationship is bizarre, and sometimes even vaguely erotic. Riccardo describes a love between them more passionate than that between lovers - and perhaps because of that passion there are huge amounts of jealousy and anger as well as love. The two brothers share everything - including women, in what are portrayed as strange tag-team sorts of sexual encounters, where - to put it bluntly - Riccardo finishes what Carlo can only start. There's also an interesting exploration of Farinelli's relationship with the great composer Handel (Jeroen Krabbe), which revolves around their work for rival opera houses in London. It's really very interesting.The movie is mostly in Italian and French, which necessitates subtitles for English speakers, which I always find a bit distracting. I was also disappointed that the movie depicts virtually nothing of Farinelli's time in the Spanish court, where Farinelli became court musician to King Philip V - and apparently very influential, as well. Still, it's very well done, and you don't have to be a fan of opera to enjoy this. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Superb vehicle for the study of the Baroque period and performance practice.","Date":"19 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  This sumptuous film is a unique opportunity for the study of Baroque performance practice.

Acutely accurate Baroque ornamentation is observed not only in the musical performances, but also in the impeccable costume and set design. The film is based on the true life story of the most famous singer in early eighteenth century Europe. I highly recommend this film (for mature audiences).

It centers on the life and career of the 18th-century Italian opera singer Carlo Broschi, known as Farinelli, considered the greatest castrato singer of all time; as well as the relation with his brother, composer Riccardo Broschi. Although based on real-life events, dramatic license was taken to a great extent, and only the basic facts of Farinelli's life are correct, while the plot line is completely fictional and far removed from what is known about real-life Carlo Broschi (1705-1782). For example, the ambiguous relationship between the Broschi brothers, the stormy one with rival composer Handel, and Farinelli's own amorous escapades and over-the-top rock star attitude are totally spurious. Additionally, Farinelli's brother is given much more importance than he actually had in his brother's career, while Porpora's own (and that of other composers of the Neapolitan School as well) is De-emphasized; the movie also offers a different explanation for how Carlo Broschi came to take the stage name Farinelli than what has been historically ascertained. George Frideric Handel, played by Jeroen Krabbé, is made out to be somewhat of a villain, but that is based on the competition between the London theater at which Handel's music was played and the rival theater at which Farinelli sang for a short period It was released in 1994 and won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film in 1995. It was also nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. "},{"Title":"To make people understand History, you have to change it (a bit)","Date":"16 July 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" This film is a very correct biography of Carlo Broschi, the most famous castrato-countertenor of the 18th century, and of all times. Not only is it told in a simple and romantisized way, so that everyone can relate to it, but it explains what made him stand out above all the other superstar-castrati of that time, either in Italy and anywhere else. The writers of the story, Renée and Gérard Corbiau, use historical figures to make this clear, much the same way the author of Amadeus did In reality, Antonio Salieri did NOT kill nor try to nor thought he did kill Mozart; he wasn't jealous of him at all, nor did he despise his personality or thought he didn't deserve the great talent he had received from God. In fact, Salieri, much like everybody else in Europe, was quite besotted about Wolfgang. He wasn't considered stupid nor vulgar (well, okay, he was, a bit; but people found that very funny in the 18th century), nor lacking merit. The author of 'Amadeus' simply used Salieri in order to show us how enormous Mozart's genius was, in a way he couldn't have done by merely tell the story of his life. The latter has been done several times, as a matter of fact, without ever having had the huge impact the film Amadeus had. But by doing it this way, it did the real Antonio Salieri great injustice. He used him as a character, not as a historical figure. In quite the same manner, the Corbiaus used George Friedrich Heandel and Ricardo Broschi, who in reality were both perfectly honorable and decent people and massively gifted composers; not to tell how great THEY were, but how great Farinelli was. Big brother Ricardo comes across, in this film, as a user, who profits from his exploited little brother both romantically, financially and musically, by first having him study music, having him castrated, writing mediocre music for him merely meant to demonstrate his extraordinary voice, much like a trained monkey. Ricardo, in this film, represents the popular music industry, which still exists today and is much the same more interested in money and other gain than in beauty, art and perfection. This Ricardo has nothing in common with the real Ricardo Broschi, who took great care of his little brother after the untimely demise of their parents, was a mother and a father to him, hesitated painfully to give his permission for the castration (which was never performed unless at the distinct and repeated plead of the young singer himself), and finally wrote beautiful music. The Heandel-character on the other hand, represents an other group of people the musical snobs, who DO know about beauty and perfection, but who let themselves be blinded by despising prejudice towards popular artists, whom the simple people worship. Those who think if it's commercially successful, it can't possibly be anything but bad! The Heandel in Farinelli, although formidably interpreted by Jeroen Krabbé, couldn't be further away from the real Heandel, who loved and respected his interpretors, who (like everybody else) was in awe before the dazzling talent of Carlo Broschi. Farinelli most probably would have become a great opera singer even without having been castrated he would have been a tenor, maybe, or a countertenor, even a baritone, who will know? But in any case his love and comprehension of music and beauty, his soul was so great, he would have been a god of song anyways. No, in the story, poor Heandel is badly abused; this is however not the real Heandel. That one, the real one, is in the divine music filling this film to the rim. That's where the real Heandel and the real Ricardo Broschi are given the honor they deserve. 'Farinelli' tells how a gifted, but shallow pop star slowly evolves into a fantastic virtuoso, who forces the respect of everyone, and leaves all mediocrity behind. The performances are extraordinary. I think Carlo Broschi would have been pleased with this film about his life. It's not just a long ode to his greatness it's a tale of the struggle a little boy has to go through to reach the top of his capabilities, accepting every suffering, every humiliation, every sacrifice it takes to get there. "},{"Title":"Best ever !!!","Date":"18 September 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":" He was born in Puglia to a family of minor nobility. His father, Salvatore, was a governor of Marate and Cisternino from 1706 to 1709. He was castrated as a boy to preserve his beautiful voice into adulthood.Following in the tradition of those before him he was sent to a 'conservatory', a place reserved for the training of castrati. These places gave the boys extensive voice training, lessons on composing and also provided them with the opportunity to improvise, hence the reports of Farinelli as elaborating on the composed pieces he was given, much to the delight of his audiences. He gave himself the stage name Farinelli, after an Italian magistrate.Under the instruction of Nicola Porpora, Farinelli acquired a voice of marvellous beauty. He became famous throughout southern Italy as il ragazzo (the boy). At the 1720 performance of Porpora's Angelica e Medoro, Farinelli sang in a public venue for the first time. In 1722, he made his first appearance at Rome in his master's Eumene, creating the greatest enthusiasm by surpassing a popular German trumpet player, for whom Porpora had written an obbligato to one of the boy's songs, in holding and swelling a note of prodigious length, purity and power, and in the variations, roulades and trills which he introduced into the air. In operas he often sang the leading woman role in Porpora's Adelaide.In 1724, Farinelli appeared at Vienna, and at Venice in the following year, returning to Napoli shortly afterwards. He sang at Milan in 1726, where Johann Joachim Quantz heard him and wrote of his singingFarinelli had a penetrating, full, rich, bright and well-modulated soprano voice, with a range at that time from the A below middle C to the D two octaves above middle C. ... His intonation was pure, his trill beautiful, his breath control extraordinary and his throat very agile, so that he performed the widest intervals quickly and with the greatest ease and certainty. Passage work and all kinds of melismas were of no difficulty to him. In the invention of free ornamentation in adagio he was very fertile.Farinelli sang at Bologna in 1727. It was there that he first met and acknowledged himself vanquished by the singer Antonio Bernacchi (fifteen years Farinelli's senior), to whose instruction he was much indebted. With ever-increasing success and fame, Farinelli appeared in nearly all the great cities of Italy; he returned a third time to Vienna in 1731.He modified his style (it is said) on the advice of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, from mere bravura of the Porpora school to one of pathos and simplicity. He visited London in 1734, arriving in time to lend his powerful support to the faction which, in opposition to Handel, had set up a rival opera with Porpora as composer and Senesino as principal singer. Not even Farinelli's aid could make the undertaking successful.His first appearance at the Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre was in Artaserse, much of the music of which was by his brother, Riccardo Broschi. His success was instantaneous. Frederick, Prince of Wales and the court loaded him with favours and presents. Having spent three years in England, Farinelli set out for Spain, staying a few months on the way in France, where he sang before Louis XV. In Spain, where he had only meant to stay a few months, he ended by passing nearly 25 years. His voice, employed by the queen to cure King Philip V of his melancholy madness, acquired for him an influence with Philip which eventually gave him the power, if not the name, of prime minister.For two decades, Farinelli was required to sing the same songs to the king. Shortly after the ascension of King Ferdinand VI, Farinelli was appointed director of theaters in Madrid and Aranjuez, and most of the operas he put on had texts by Pietro Metastasio. He was knighted in 1750 and decorated with the cross of Calatrava. He utilized his power at court by persuading Ferdinand to establish an Italian opera. He also collaborated with Domenico Scarlatti, a fellow Neapolitan living in Spain. The musicologist Ralph Kirkpatrick acknowledges Farinelli's correspondence as providing most of the direct information about Scarlatti that has transmitted itself to our day. After the accession of Charles III, Farinelli retired to Bologna with the fortune he had amassed, where he spent the remainder of his days with Metastasio, dying a few months after him. His estate included gifts from royalty and valuable musical instruments, such as a Stradivarius violin.Farinelli not only sang, but he also played keyboard instruments and the viola d'amore. He occasionally composed, writing the text and music of a farewell to London aria, and an aria for Ferdinand VI, as well as keyboard sonatas.This entry was originally based on the entry in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica.This is one off the best movies I have ever seen !!!!

There are plenty of positives though. I personally did find the drama engrossing, true it isn't faithful from a historical standpoint, then again I can't think of any biopic of a musician or composer that didn't take some kind of liberty with the truth, but Farinelli is an emotionally-charged film and there was plenty of that. That is also true of the writing, which flows well and didn't feel jarring. The film looks spectacular, the costumes and sets are gorgeous to look at and is shot and directed beautifully. I have no faults with the music either, it is so good that my appreciation for early music further grew. The singing is equally wonderful, the scene in the theatre with the long high note was unbelievable. Stefano Dionisi is magnetic in the title role, Enrico Lo Verso brings intensity to the role of the less talented brother, Marianne Cellier has a very expressive face and Jereon Knabbe gives one of his best ever performances positively relishing his role as Handel(even if you question whether Handel was really like that).

I find myself very drawn to the kinky drama of the castrato singer -- and longing to hear what his voice really sounded like. I've been listening to recordings of Mozart's Queen of the Night aria recorded by women and boys nowadays and frustrated that everyone who sings it sounds strained and harsh -- wondering what Farinelli, the greatest singer in opera history, would have sounded like singing it.Unfortunately, I don't think the voice or the body in this movie were accurate.A castrato singer would have the lightness of a boy's voice. Sometimes the synthesized voice in this movie captured that, but generally it was too heavy. I sort of imagine a castrato soprano sounding more like Michael Jackson in Little Susie, only probably higher.Also, this actor had a prominent Adam's apple, heavy bony structure around the eyes and jaw, and rippling muscles all over his body. A castrato, a person who had lacked testosterone since childhood, would lack all these things. He would have an angelic face, with childlike eyes -- more like the boy actor used for Farinelli before castration. The castrato would also have few visible muscles -- and certainly no visible Adam's apple. He might have enjoyed sex, but would have been unlikely to be so aggressive as this character was. Also, the idea that castrati could not achieve climax, as indicated in this movie was likely wrong. Moreover, not having gone through puberty, the castrato would likely have had a more gentle, childlike personality than this character, also endearing him to women.Women reportedly fainted when listening to the castrati sing. No one would have really fainted for the character in this movie. He just did not have the kind of eyes or the kind of voice to make a woman faint. It's as if the people who did the movie just were clueless.At the high point of the castrati, they were castrating 4,000 boys a year in Italy, supposedly. Presumably they were drawn to all that barbarism because the voices were really extraordinary, not merely high but of a quality to be drug-like in their beauty.I hope someone will try again -- and do better on the casting and synthesized singing this time. I want to be drawn into the vocal experience that was so amazing that they would castrate little boys to achieve it.
