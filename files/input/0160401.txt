Those looking for a more low-keyed, subdued and thoughtful study of the realities of life as an undercover cop will, however, find much in this film to admire and appreciate.  Omar Epps stars as a Cincinnati-based rookie cop, Officer Jeff Cole, who goes undercover to nab a major cocaine dealer from New Jersey who calls himself `God,' (played by rapper LL Cool J) and who, Godfather-like, involves himself heavily in familial values and efforts to `help' the struggling members of his blighted neighborhood.  In its exploration of its subject, the film wisely eschews the over-the-top fantasy heroics that afflict so many action films and, instead, tethers itself to the harsh, often ugly realities of the dangerous criminal world in which it is set.  The movie builds much of its drama and suspense by bringing to the foreground the fascinating logistics that go into undercover police work, forcing us to witness first hand the risks, the moral compromises (to be convincing, Cole has to snort cocaine himself, for example) and the psychological ambiguities that invariably accompany the job. Cole is a man who has been obsessed from the early days of his underprivileged, slum-ridden childhood with making a difference in a crime-infested world he knows all too well from first hand experience.  This makes him a natural choice for infiltrating this underworld existence since his background has given him the understanding he needs as a point-of-entry.  Thus, as he embarks on this new and dangerous career, we see the innate compassion he extends to those caught in the same environment from which he has sprung, an empathy that, in the context of his job, often leads him into a `softness' that clouds his judgment and ends up endangering his life further.  In addition, as he is accepted more deeply into the inner circle of trust that God has set up around himself, Cole begins to question his own loyalties &#150; or so, at least, the offers in charge of him begin to believe.  (This, I imagine, is the undercover agent version of the Stockholm Syndrome that afflicts so many kidnap victims, often leading them to transfer their loyalties from their rescuers to their abductors).  The screenplay, though it could be sharper and more incisive at times, occasionally achieves substance in its examination of just what happens to an undercover agent's mind when he does indeed get `in too deep.'  In addition, the film frequently achieves moments of genuine suspense, in truly scary scenes involving God's uncontrolled displays of manic violence and torture and in moments when Cole's entire cover seems to have been `blown.'  In those moments, LL Cool J hits all the right notes in his performance but, both he and Epps, unfortunately, lack the dramatic and emotional range as actors necessary to make their quieter, more intimate moments effectively credible.  In addition, the dialogue often rings untrue, especially in the conversations among the commanding officers played by Stanley Tucci and, in another weak portrayal, Pam Grier among others.With better performances, harder-edged dialogue and slightly more energetic direction, `In Too Deep' might have been a great study of moral conflict set within the context of an exciting policier.   On the other hand, the film could also have been much worse.  As it is, `In Too Deep' respects the seriousness of both its subject matter and its audience and provides a number of powerful scenes - factors for which we are grateful but which also make us yearn for the high quality film that might have been.

There's the cop who starts to like, somewhat, his target, there's the beating up of a once trusted confidant on a pool table, there's the frequent meetings in out of the way places with his superiors.

"},{"Title":"In Too Deep makes the grade.","Date":"9 September 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Thriller, Drama","Review":" Despite the negative criticism leveled at In Too Deep for the notoriety of its violence, this superficial but entertaining urban police thriller is considerably less gory and graphic than Belly, last year's stylishly overwrought narcotics yarn. Anybody who remembers classic undercover cop capers, like Serpico, Rush, Deep Cover, New Jack City, Donnie Brasco, or even a Wiseguy or Miami Vice TV episode, should find In Too Deep ranks as a tolerably exciting but hopelessly derivative variation on a well-worn theme. Although Australian director Michael Angel Heart Rymer and Dead Presidents writer Michael Henry Brown and The Octagon scribe Paul Aaron stick to the formula, they have provided enough new material so that In Too Deep doesn't overdose on clich√©s.In Too Deep chronicles the predicament that undercover Cincinnati cop Jeff Cole (Omar Epps of The Mod Squad) confronts when he must prove he is not the heat but a home boy to a suspicious, big-time coke dealer. Worse, after he infiltrates the organization, Coe must never let the camaraderie that develops between the hoodlums and him interfere with his goal of busting him. Rymer and his scenarists dilute some of the suspense by unfolding the story in flashbacks as our hero lectures a class of Chicago rookies about the dangers of undercover work. Obviously, Cole will survive the ordeal intact no matter how treacherous the obstacles, because we see him after the fact rapping to rookies! Anti-climactic and predictable as In Too Deep remains, Rymer and his writers cobble together a serviceable actioneer with layers of atmosphere.Cole is fresh out of the police academy when he volunteers to go undercover for Captain Preston Boyd (Stanley Tucci of Big Night). Initially, Boyd is leery, but he lets Cole make a buy, and nothing terrible happens. The next time out things go haywire when Cole tries to bust two Latino coke dealers. Their imposing, steely-eyed mother grabs his crotch where the latest surveillance technology is nestled to hang the dealers. Cole dismisses this close shave and pleads for bigger game Dwayne Gittens. A refugee from New Jersey who has settled in Cincinnati, Gittens (L.L. Cool J) runs 80 per cent of the coke in town and calls himself 'God. According to Boyd, nobody has ever gotten close enough to Gittens to nail him. Posing as a drug dealer from Akron, Coe pursues Gittens, but he nearly dies when a duo of renegade dealers working for Gittens try to take him out.As J. Reid, Coe defends himself and caps one of the dealers, and then turns himself in to Boyd. Promptly taking Coe off the case, Boyd packs him off to a safe house in the sticks. While Cole cools his heels, Boyd signs him up for photography classes at a nearby university. Coe meets Myra (Nia Long of Love Jones) during a photo modeling session and the sparks fly. After a rip-roaring, gangsta-busting opening, In Too Deep shifts gears from an inner city shoot'em up to a chick flick in the country. Antsy as Coe is to bust 'God,' he goes over Boyd's head and cuts a deal with the D.E.A. Before you can say 'reload,' Coe shows up back in Cincinnati. 'God' is overjoyed to see him and apologizes for the slip-up. Jeff Cole grows so obsessed with arresting 'God' that he crosses the line between good and evil and his undercover gangsta persona overshadows who he really is. Eventually, the transformation becomes complete. When he tries to see Myra, she vows to have nothing to do with him.Although In Too Deep imitates many earlier undercover cop movies, several things differentiate it. Happily, the producers selected a city other than New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago, or San Francisco as the setting for their film. The Cincinnati police uniforms with their white kepis make the cops look like AFJROTC cadets. Even though he doesn't say much as Coe's superior, Stanley Tucci delivers his lines with none of the usual loud-mouthed antics of the stereotypical police captain. Tucci's voice is so crisp and commanding that you hang on his every word that way you might with Anthony Hopkins. The filmmakers know when to turn up the hip-hop music and when to turn it off, especially during the obligatory romance between Coe and Myra where the music lightens up to reflect the intimacy of the situation. Finally, Rymer and company conclude the action with a less-than-gratuitous gunfight that leaves the villain standing so that he can be convicted and sentenced to two life terms in prison. Typically, the villains die a horrible death in these movies.Omar Epps has more to do as an undercover cop in In Too Deep than he had in The Mod Squad. At times, when he dons an obvious wig, he resembles a young Yaphet Kotto. Nevertheless, he creates a sympathetic cop, and he doesn't perform any fake heroics or stunts that an ordinary man couldn't match. Epps convincingly captures the dilemma that his psychologically warped out detective succumbs to when his bad guy persona gains control of him. Meanwhile, rapper L.L. Cool J forges a memorable villain in Dwayne 'God' Gittens. . In Too Deep qualifies as an above-average entry in the drug bust genre, though it pales by comparison with New Jack City, Donnie Brasco, or Serpico. Sloppy scripting sometimes mars the overall sense of believability. After Cole busts the Latino drug dealers, he waltzes out of his house amid a swarm of cops, and a friend of the family spots him. Later, she tells one of 'God's' henchmen, and Coe has to prove himself again. The measure of Cole's success is reflected in 'God's' decision to ignore this cry of warning. Fluid, kinetic helming by Michael Rymer keeps the action moving ahead at a swift clip that rarely slackens off, except in the romantic moments. The villains aren't cupcakes, and the hero's plight is no picnic. If you enjoy slam-bang cop thrillers, In Too Deep makes the grade.

In Too Deep is powerful, dark, gripping and keeps you in uncertainty of what's going to happen till the very end. A very realistic experience, with attention paid to the tiniest details and legalities - this isn't your average stupid Tarantino flick where undercover cops go around happily shooting anyone they want whenever they feel like it; this feels almost *real*! I doubt if the movie was actually based on a true story of an undercover policeman (unless the story is the obvious fact that thousands of policemen risk their lives every month working undercover all over the world), but if anything like it ever happened, you can safely bet that it happened exactly the way the movie tells it. Highly recommended, especially for anyone interested in true crime. I hope it comes out on DVD, with extras and specials - this movie deserves it. If while reading Donnie Brasco (NOT while watching its stupid film version...) you ever wondered what it would be like if moved to the 1990s, In Too Deep will answer your questions! (By the way, have you noticed that God looks somewhat like a thin Suge Knight, while J-Reed looks a bit like an older version of Tupac Shakur...?)

I knew from the plot summary that it was going to be a version of Deep Cover, but with more rappers!  However I did actually quite enjoy it.  The plot, while not original, is actually pretty good fun to watch.  The only thing that slowed it down was the seemingly pointless addition of the romance subplot which took the wind out of the film without adding anything to it.  The main plot though is quite energetic and exciting &#150; the question of whether Jeff will go `in too deep' or not is pretty moot simply due to the nature of the film but it is still good.Although in many films, rappers stand out as giving poor cameos etc, here they all do well.  In fact the soundtrack is a good mix of hip hop all used to good effect.  The opening credits are stylishly shot and the director does a pretty good job of mixing a gritty street feel with some stylish flourishes.  The film feels very polished and professional rather the sort of cheap rubbish that many predominately-rapper cast films have been in the past few years.Speaking of cast, Epps does a good job as a leading man, he is a solid black actor who could be somewhere between Washington and Snipes in terms of abilities and genre.  LL Cool J does a good job, enjoying himself playing a bad guy.  He is actually quite a good actor simply because he picks projects that don't stretch his abilities.  Long is a beautiful woman but is wasted in a pointless role here &#150; she is worthy of more.  Support cast includes a long line of rappers & cameos etc who do reasonable jobs &#150; Sticky Fingaz is perfect in this type of role (albeit perpetuating a stereotype) and other faces include Pam Grier, Nas, Dupri and Mya.Overall this is a surprisingly enjoyable film that is criminally underwatched.

What I didn't care for was the blatant racism from Director Michael Rymer. Everything was very well done, but it is very obvious that the Writer/Director of this film was white, while the majority of the cast was black. What I witnessed was a film where all the people in charge were white, all the thugs were black, but it didn't end there. The white people spoke eloquently, while even the black officers and other non-affiliated cast members all spoke street. Every person from the rookie cops aging father to the man who ran the convenience store were dropping F bombs left and right, adding man to every other word, and constantly saying the N word. I understand the point of this movie was to be real, but part of that realism was that this gang had never been infiltrated because of how smart they were. Instead of being portrayed as smooth and savvy, the leaders of the gang were portrayed as ignorant thugs and that really takes away from the film.

There isn't one original idea to be found anywhere in this film; you'll recognize scenes taken from movies you haven't even seen! The beginning-at-the-end structure eliminates most of the suspense as well. But if you insist on watching the film, be sure to rent the DVD version with optional English subtitles, because only about 50% of the dialogue is comprehensible.

The film contains very strong language , violence and scenes viewers may find disturbing  said the announcer which led me to believe the station might have been better of showing a comedy if they were going to change the schedule Yes indeed IN TOO DEEP does contain strong language and scenes of violence , I sure hope the bad guy chalked his pool stick before taking his shot . From the outset it's obvious what the story is about and where it's heading , an undercover cop infiltrates a drugs gang and ends up going native so right away you're reminded of NEW JACK CITY , DONNIE BRASCO and the little seen British thriller I.D . It's hardly ground breaking but it is entertaining enough if you like streetwise urban thrillers . If I have two criticisms it's the clich√©d dialogue which sound like the opening sequence of the Aphex Twin music video WINDOW LICKER ( Do all homies talk like this ? ) and the very abrupt ending Six out of Ten "}]
