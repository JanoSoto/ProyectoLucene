The game is an amazing 2D fighter with a wide array of characters from different continents who battle it out for...something.The Movie, surprisingly, has more plot than you would think. M. Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) is now portrayed as a megalomanical super villain who has dreams of causing collapse to the entire world, such as killing a large number of hostages unless paid a ransom worthy of Dr. Evil standards, creating a breed of super soldiers and kidnapping the Queen of England and create his own world based off of his image. Trust me, it is as silly as it sounds.Lt. Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) approaches the situation in that he has to save the hostages and hopefully put Bison on ice, once and for all, thus stopping his plans for world domination.From there on in, the movie is basically an almost two hour fan service with various subplots with almost all the characters from the Street Fighter universe. Zangief and Dee Jay work for M. Bison as Muscle and Computer Technician, respectively. Chun-Li, Balrog and E. Honda are all out for get revenge and Ken and Ryu are professional fighters hoping to score a battle against the vain Vega and evil Sagat.Like I said, the rest of the movie is nothing short of fan service, since all the actors deliver some truly awful one liners aside, Van Damme's Guile almost sounds like Tommy Wiseau (The Room) when you close your eyes, and the whole plot itself is actually quite boring.Well, why in the world would someone defend this movie then? I'll give you three reasons, two are part of the movie, and one is a personal thing.1. Raul Julia's M. Bison. A villain who looks rather powerful should be given a great performance. While Raul Julia did die after this movie was over, there is no denying that he went out with a bang rather than whimper. His performance is laughably over the top, but at no point do you look at his face and see a man who seems to think he's in a movie, and as a result, he makes the movie quite amazing. If anything, he gives us a theatrical villain which, for his character, works very well.2. There was a lot of room for potential here. Let's be honest, writing a movie is easy, but writing a good movie is hard. The director (Who is also the writer) took a fighting video game and crafted a movie out of it, and a fairly well done one at that. Sure, not in execution, but in originality, it works.3. It was a movie from my childhood. I was a child of the 90's, and as such, I can remember my parents letting me watch this at a very young age, and it was awesome. Damn the Nostalgia factor, but it's what makes this movie really good. I can remember how intimidated I was in the final battle scenes, and how cool M. Bison was to me (in that over the top Saturday Morning Cartoon style of cool).This movie is a very easy one to attack for just not being good, but understand from my point of view, even knowing how bad it is, having no character development, some truly cheesy one liners and awful performances, including Van Damme giving a performance that makes him sound like Tommy Wiseau if he smoked cigarettes for ten years and you closed your eyes real tight, I still like it.It's cheesy, terrible and ridiculous, but all you need to know is that Raul Julia delivers some of the best lines for years to come, and you know you are dealing with a kind of cult classic when one of the film's greatest lines is, This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely, you've heard of it. In other words, go see this movie if you haven't already.7/10.

But, I enjoyed it from the first time I saw it on T.V. The two main actors, Raul Julia and Jean-Claude Van Damme portray their characters well, though Kylie Monigue turned me off her character a little. Be in mind that being based on a video game it can not be perfected to follow the games exactly. In general the movie is centred around two forces based in Shadaloo, where A.N. (Allied Nation) hostages are taken by General M. Bison (Raul Julia) and unless is demands are met, he'll kill every single hostage is has. It is up to the U.N. leader, military commanding officer Colonel William F. Guile and his army to rescue them. They are joined along the way, under unfortunate circumstances, by a ninja journalist Chun-Li Zang (the voice of Mulan) her two friends a former sumo-wrestler E. Honda (Peter Navy Tuiasosopo) and former boxer Balrog (Grand L. Bush) as well as two thieves, Ryu Hoshi (Bryon Mann) and Ken Masters (Damian Chapa). A good enjoyable movie with some light class actors and a well thought out plot . Okay so not every person in the world will love this, but when you want something for a rainy day (like it is out here) then this is the type of movie I'd recommend. Overall I gave it 10/10 because not only is Jean-Claude Van Damme one of my favourite actors, everyone of his movies entertains me greatly, not to mention the awesome fighting scenes. For fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme who have not seen many of his movies I recommend that you see The Replicant, Timecop and maybe Universal Soldier (if you don't mind a little bit of a corny actors based around him).

The storyline is solid, and is, contrary to what most people believe, somewhat true to the story. Like it or not, Guile and Chun-Li are meant to be the main characters in SF2 and the movie reflects this. In the games, their endings are directly tied to Bison. Of the remaining 14 characters (obviously not counting Bison,) only one other is Cammy's, and that's only because Bison tells her about her amnesia.As for the casting, it was very well done. The only problems I saw/heard are Van-Damme's French accent, Dhalsim's casting as a doctor, which WAS well done despite being unfaithful to the game, T. Hawk's lack of height (I think Rainwater is shorter than Van-Damme) and Chapa's short hair. Otherwise, everything else was spot-on, especially the casting for Bison. Raul Julia is the only person that I think could've done it. He's a fairly versatile actor AND he looks like Bison. A couple other characters were miscasted like Dhalsim, but the excellent acting made up for that.The combination of Charlie and Blanka was both acceptable and unacceptable. How? Street Fighter Alpha didn't come out until a year after this film did, but both Blanka's and Guile's endings disprove the combination. Getting back to the story, it was actually believable for not being based around a tournament like SF2 is. Being forced into a three day timetable by Bison's ransom demands made the movie seem all the more action-packed, to me at least. The scene between Bison and Chun-Li in Bison's quarters could've been cut out, though, except for the part where Bison was about to get his butt kicked by Chun-Li. The final battle between Bison and Guile was the most blatantly choreographed yet still exciting thing I had ever seen in a martial arts movie up to that point, other than the odd scene from a few Jackie Chan movies.The sound was pretty horrible. Generic rap somehow found its way into the movie in the cage fighting arena scene, and I swear I heard it again when I played the god-awful SF3 Third Strike. That one should've been permanently shelved. The orchestrated music that made it into the movie was nearly impossible to hear, although some of it was vaguely reminiscent of Guile's stage in SF2. The worst part was the lack of music from the game. A symphony orchestra doing all the music from the characters that made it into the movie (so no Fei-Long or Akuma) would've been great. So would have the Amiga CD32 version of Super Turbo if it was out or the arcade version of Super.Many of the characters signature moves are not present. I counted one Hadouken (to Vega in the Ryu+Ken vs. Vega+Sagat fight in Bison's quarters, very easy to miss as it's done at point-blank range,) a few flash kicks (minus the special effect,) and one Psycho Crusher (I think that's the name.) No Sonic Boom, no Shoryuken, no anything else.Overall, there are a few glaring issues (sound and lack of special moves mostly,) but it's still very enjoyable.7/10Recommended to Martial arts fans Van-Damme fans Street Fighter fansNot Recommended to Street Fighter fans who believe Ryu and Ken are supposed to be the main characters without realizing only three endings out of sixteen people (not counting Bison and including Akuma) are actually tied to Bison himself.

How ironic, then, that the movie following is anything but. For a movie that purports to be based on one of the most well-known arcade games of all time, the Street Fighter movie does not so much tell the story of the game as it does rape, butcher, and mangle it into an unrecognizable form. The Mortal Kombat adaptation, while certainly not being a cinematic masterpiece, at least stayed relatively faithful to the games.Somewhere along the line in this parade of broken lives and shattered dreams, someone decided that the tournament-based, Enter the Dragon-like storyline of the game would never fly with the American movie-going public. And so it was rewritten, becoming a typical American action flick, with plenty of huge explosions, loud gunfights, and thinly veiled right-wing propaganda. A Japanese protagonist? That will never do. Why not cast the Belgian Jean Claude Van Damme as the American Guile, and have him become the main character? It's not as if fans of the game are going to mind, are they?Street Fighter the movie is a catastrophe. Every character, bar none, from the games is butchered and rewritten beyond recognition. Chun Li, played perhaps the only well-casted actor in this dreck, Ming Na Wen, has become a mere reporter (with a smirking Balrog and a Hawaiian shirted E. Honda as her camera crew, natch) instead of a detective, Ryu and Ken are incompetent gun smugglers, and Jimmy/Blanka and Charles/Nash become the same person in one of the most laughably absurd plot contrivances ever thought up. There are so many incongruities between this movie and the game that it becomes difficult to tell if they are merely the result of the incompetence of the writers, or their actual intent. For example, were the writers (whom I hope are begging for change at bus stop right about now) aware that Shadaloo was merely the name of M. Bison's organization, and not the name of a fictitious South Asian country? (which conveniently rests atop present-day Myanmar?) Or were they simply not paying close enough attention to the game's storyline? Who knows?Consider the most egregious example of the screenwriters' disdain for the source material M. Bison walks into his laboratory and addresses one of the scientists there as Doctor Dhalsim. Was Dhalsim a doctor in the game? Do we ever see him fight in this movie? Do we ever see him using his remarkably elastic limbs? The answer to all these questions, of course, is no. The writer's simply drop in a character named Dhalsim just for the sake of saying they included him. The movie's failing is in its desperation to include every single character to the detriment of the rest of the film. I can only imagine what Akuma would have looked like had the writers decided to include him.Anyone who played through Street Fighter knows that each character had at least one defining personality trait. Ryu was the stoic martial artist seeking to become a true warrior, his friend Ken was brash and arrogant, Vega was obsessed with beauty, Sagat wanted revenge on Ryu for scarring his chest, etc. It should come as no surprise that none of these traits appear in any shape, form or fashion in this movie, and in the rare moment that a character DOES act like their game counterpart, it's more often the result some sort of lame contrivance than a scripted personality trait. Chun Li's cameraman Balrog only happens to box. When Ryu and Ken and inducted into M. Bison's army, the uniforms they wear just happen to resemble the white and red karate gis they wore in the game. To top it all off, M. Bison gives a lengthy explanation of how his magnetic levitation that allows him to perform the movie's equivalent of the Psycho Crusher. It's as if the screenwriters set out to make a completely different movie, and were only told halfway through that it was supposed to be a Street Fighter movie.Which brings me to my next point; there's little actual street fighting, giving fans of the games precious little to chew on through the movie's running length. Whatever fight scenes we get are brief and unexciting, and are nothing next to other martial arts movies. Instead we get Jean Claude Van Damme running from scene to scene, spewing out pithy one-liner after one-liner, gleefully trampling any remaining source material that hasn't already been butchered. Only Raul Julia and Ming Na Wen come through with any dignity left; they apparently realized what a turkey this film was and at least tried to have some fun with their roles. Their noble efforts, however, are sunk by the awful screenplay, which should be an example to future filmmakers of how NOT to adapt a video game to the big screen.As an aside note, there was actually an arcade game made of this movie. Yes, it was terrible, too.

If you believe the Wikipedia article about this movie, Van Damme and Raul Julia's salaries ate up most of the $35 million budget (hard to believe Mr. Spinning Side Kick of Death made $8 million for this crap). Van Damme was also notoriously carrying on an affair during production with co-star Kylie Minogue while his then wife was pregnant.

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE YET, PLEASE DON'T READ THIS REVIEW!Still with me? Good.Street Fighter is based off of the video game series of the same name, though it is more popularly known for Street Fighter II with its vast assortment of heroes and villains. The movie features the same characters from the game and three from another Street Fighter game. Instead of a World Warrior tournament of fighters like in the game, the movie focuses on General M. Bison (the late, talented Raul Julia) wanting world domination in pure James Bond villain style, with a vast secret hideout and dozens of henchmen. Bison has taken 63 hostages and demands 20 billion dollars to be given to him in three days for their return. Bison is also working on a super-soldier program (isn't that Captain America territory?), in which Dr. Dhalsim (Roshan Seth) is unwillingly mutating Guile's captured friend, Carlos Blanka (Robert Mammone), into a green-skinned, orange-haired man-beast (think orange Don King hair on the Hulk, but not as strong or muscular).The Allied Forces are fighting Bison's troops and Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme, whose last name you still can't say out loud without muttering unintentional profanity), Bison's long-time nemesis, is determined to get them back. Guile makes a deal with two arrested smugglers, Ken Masters (Damian Chapa) and Ryu Hoshi (Byron Mann), to join the gang of Bison's main henchman, Victor Sagat (Wes Studi), to find Bison's hideout in exchange for their freedom and passports back home. The problem is, reporter and martial arts expert Chun Li Zang (Ming-Na Wen) is after Bison for murdering her father. Chun Li takes her film crew and fellow fighters, Balrog (Grand L. Bush) and Edmond Honda (Peter Tuiasosopo), to follow Ken and Ryu.At Bison's fortress, Chun Li, Balrog and Honda are captured while the homing device Ken and Ryu have lead Guile to the hideout. With the aid of Cammy (Kylie Minogue), T-Hawk (Gregg Rainwater) and his soldiers, Guile invades the fortress and helps his friends save the hostages, while taking down Bison and his forces.Well, except for Honda being a Hawaiian sumo, Balrog being a hero instead of one of Bison's evil henchmen, Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) being a villain instead of a hero, Sagat not being a 7 foot tall tough fighter like the game, and other various changes, the actors do mostly resemble the video game characters and their looks. The movie actually improves on Ryu and Ken by making them more relatable. In the game, Ken is a wealthy, vicious and arrogant fighter, while Ryu has forsaken everything else in his life to perfect his fighting skills. In the movie, Ryu and Ken are the buddy team you see in every action film, but here it works. The two steal from criminals by selling them weapons that turn out to be bogus. Ryu is a straight-man with a conscience and will to help others without thought of profit, while Ken wants to be rich and has a wondering eye for good-looking single ladies.The cast works well, particularly Minogue as Cammy, Van-Damme as Guile, Jay Tavare as Sagat's helper Vega, Wen as Chun Li, Studi as Sagat, Chapa as Ken, Mann as Ryu and, best of all, Julia as Bison. Bryniarski also does great as the not-so-smart, yet good hearted henchman Zangief who turns good by the end and he has the best laugh-out-loud moments (like when he realizes Dee Jay works for the evil Bison because of the paycheck, Zangief asks, You got paid?).The action works well and the fight scenes work well, especially Ken VS. Sagat, Ryu VS. Vega and Bison VS. Guile. But curiously, most don't have many memorable fights except with guards (like Balrog and Cammy), which is a shame, since so many opportunities for fights don't happen in the film. For example, Chun Li has a brief fight and awesome fight with Bison, but she doesn't fight any other villains except for Bison guards. Others, like Dhalsim, don't fight at all. And while it's nice to try and have an origin for Blanka, he's not as feral or muscular (or cool) as he is in the game, nor does he have any memorable fights, except in quick glimpses with - you guessed it, Bison guards.Also, none of the characters have any special powers like in the game. It's a shame things like Ryu's fireball (which only happens in a brief flash of light in the fight against Vega), Ken's flaming fist when he uses his Dragon Punch move and Dhalsim's fire breath are all absent.If you watch after the end credits, the film has an ending that sets up for a sequel (which, right now, is reportedly in the works).

It was almost that feeling that Star Wars geeks get at new Star Wars premiers and then.....the movie started. Ha ha, oh man this movie was just so terrible in it's live action format. The characters were poorly embodied by their actors. They weren't dead on either. Doctor Dhalsim? Gimme a break! This movie is just awful. I remember the theater being packed and as the movie kept going I just started to slouch and hide in my seat. I was just embarrassed to be watching this fiasco of a movie. The acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, everything is a mess. I just couldn't wait for it to end. When it did, I just wanted to get the hell out of the theater as soon as possible so that no one I knew would know I just sat through that movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. Mortal Kombat 1 is a far superior movie to this garbage and takes it's approach a lot more serious. Street Fighter doesn't amuse or entertain or even make you laugh, it just deserves to get flushed down the toilet. Street Fighter 2 the Animated Movie is a lot better and their characters are identical to those of the video game. No ridiculous flipping kicks by Van Damme either. A 1 out of 10.

Okay, they did that a while back with Pac Man, but that was a cartoon for kids. Street Fighter is not meant for kids - it is a Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie, which to me usually means that it is going to be rubbish. I watched Street Fighter expecting it to be rubbish and I was not disappointed.This movie I just could not take seriously. It was not a comedy and that was what made it worse. The only redeemable character was a tough so stupid that he didn't realise that the bad guy was actually a bad guy. It wasn't funny because it was funny, it was funny because it was just so stupid. This movie is one you watch with friends because you just sit there paying out all of the flaws.Some people say Van Damme can't act. Well, in this movie whenever he spoke I would wince. If he can't act then this movie proves it. And if he is supposed to be French then what is the accent that he has. The only reason Van Damme draws a crowd is because he is a good fighter, but you don't notice this in this movie, the fight scenes are rubbish. The bad guy flies around the screen shooting Van Damme with lightning bolts and Van Damme, with one kick, kills him. And this guy is supposed to be a top notch martial artist. Hey, he spends most of the movie fantasising over killing Van Damme and when he does meet him he gets his butt kicked in two seconds. All I can say is that I wish I missed this movie.

Only problem is, that it was made mid 90's and it had a budget over 30 millions. With that money more capable director would have made very enjoyable action flick, but of that there are no worries in the Street Fighter.Jean-Claude Van Damme gives out a even bit more worse display of his actinic skills than usual.

This isn't necessarily true, the game's plot isn't that deep you, as one of the Street Fighter characters, try to bust a drug lord and his minions. Even the game Is a little deeper than the Super Mario Bros. movie's plot (two plumbers trying to save the day), but try making a 90-minute movie out of it.Same for the movie's views of the characters. Most of them are close enough to the game's characters. The movie did portray Guile, Bison, Chun-Li, Sagat, Ken, Ryu, Cammy, Zangief and Vega correctly (Guile and Chun-Li both still have personal vendettas against Bison, Ken and Ryu have their rivalries with Sagat and Vega, etc). I had no problems with E. Honda, and Blanka and Dhalsim only briefly appear (I personally prefer the 'Charlie mutated into Blanka' story). The only characterization problem the movie had was that a few characters just weren't shown right. Steven E. DeSouza should've just re-cast the actor playing T. Hawk.

First of all, many of the characters were either miscast or shallow. However I'm gonna start off by saying that Raul Julia has changed the way we view M.Bison in the franchise. He glorifies the persona as a simple dictator bent on taking over the world. A few other characters such as Zangief and Chun-Li also kind of helped me enjoy the movie a bit better. It might be because they were the closest in having resemblance to their game counterparts.Other than that, it's pretty funny casting or interpretations of everyone else. JCVD as Guile? LOL..... Kylie Minogue as Cammy, uh.... I guess she looks the part and this extends to stuff like E.Honda being Hawaiian to Ryu and Ken being con men. So practically the movie tried to change much of the law for the shake of making a movie. It's pretty messy or as I like to say...Cheesy.The movie is pretty goofy.... The effects are pretty over the top and same goes for the fight choreography. I mean look at the fight Ryu and Vega have... The dialogue also does belong in this category too but it's pretty laughably entertaining. Alright let's talk about the story.....Well, other than the fact M.Bison wants control. Let's see what the protagonists are up to. They just need to stop him. I mean there should have been more depth for us to care about Guile or Chun-Li's reason to hate Bison. It might have been a better idea to make Charlie a deceased dude rather than integrate the name into Blanka. That's just me, but I don't think adding the name 'Charlie' means a whole lot since later games in the franchise introduce the actual character. Chun-Li on the other hand needs a more fleshed out insight into her story, that's all I want from her. Ryu and Ken who are naturally the poster children of the franchise are nothing more than two goofy side characters who go about switching alliances. They're pretty bland.

On a global scale, it was the first video game-film adaptation to turn a buck, which should count for something despite the routine bashing it receives for how shoddily it portrayed the most popular fighting game of the time on the big screen. I was personally never a huge STREET FIGHTER fan, but while I can certainly spot the plot line unfaithfulness, I can't help but notice just how fun the movie is. It's a poor adaptation and a questionable action movie, but nevertheless a decent teenaged adventure when taken at face value.The story When the mad warlord General M. Bison (Raul Julia) is poised to overrun the earth in pursuit of his own personal empire, it will be up to a multi-faceted group of fighters - including Colonel William Guile (Van Damme), reporter Chun-Li (Ming Na), and conmen Ryu Hoshi (Byron Mann) and Ken Masters (Damian Chapa) - to stop him.This film is definitely over-cast, comparable to MORTAL KOMBAT ANNIHILATION in terms of saturation. No less than fifteen characters from the original two games - more than half of their combined casts - are featured, resulting in a stifling deficit of character development, since next to none of them have the appropriate amount of screen time for it. The actual casting choices of these characters can also be taken to task, but I'm pleased that - through the admirably accurate costumes and cosmetics - most of the performers at least *look* like their animated counterparts (in some cases, like Robert Blanka Mammone, you almost wish they didn't). Personalities and backgrounds have been addled with as expected to accommodate the tournament-free premise, but none of them bother me as much as the case of M. Bison he's the single goofiest part of this whole immature adventure, practically a forerunner to Dr. Evil, having been written so comically that it's impossible to consider him threatening even when he's snapping guys' necks or shooting electricity from his fists.The movie never has a problem with pacing, rolling along fittingly enough at a video game's pace and always presenting you with some silly or bombastic event to watch; it's never boring. Sadly, there's not nearly enough fighting going on, and when it does happen it's not that great. It seems amazing that, considering what it's based on, the movie only has a 'round half-dozen fights, depending on your definition of a fight (i.e. I don't consider it a fight when Guile and his team ambush some soldiers and Kylie Minogue does a cool but unnecessary pro wrestling move), and even more amazing how very bland most of them are with Benny Urquidez supplying fight choreography. Some of the performers just aren't good, and some of them surprisingly so (is this the same Damian Chapa who rocked the house with Michael Worth in U.S. SEALS 2? I hope not!), but other times they just feel stifled. For example, the showdown between Ryu and Vega (Jay Tavare) was my favorite of the movie, and really felt like it could've gone somewhere were it not for the cramped locker room they were in.Apparently, the critical lashing STREET FIGHTER received moved Van Damme to choose his future roles more carefully, so in a pinch, I'll accredit every good movie he did subsequently to this minor disappointment. Seeing as this particular franchise hasn't done too well in live-action film regardless of who's involved, I can't be too hard on this first attempt and will continue to regard it neutrally and enjoy it by accident every few years. Fans of the games who somehow have yet to see the film should avoid it unless they're intentionally looking for something to heckle.

But he wasn't trying to just make a fighting game, he decided to use the characters and ideas of the game as the components of sci-fi action thriller, which he invented. Steven is also a director, this film is his second director's work, after a long break on screen writing career.In the film there is a big semantic implication and teachings, in the form of dialogs and remarks between the characters. The picture is filled with deep meaning, but it does not become tedious or boring, on the contrary everything is very appropriate. The film is very spectacular, excellent stunt work and work of the artists and special effects creators.Despite PG-13 rating, the film does not seem quite childish, it has a lot of violence and murder, ever-present tension. For example, the movie begins with news from the hot spot and displaying of General Bison breaks the necks of the captive soldiers. The director came up with the fictional country Shadaloo in which General Bison is trying to seize power, while on his secret base, equipped with modern equipment and weapons, serve him a lot of fighters and scientists. His ultimate goal is to have the whole world. General wants to create an army of super soldiers, mutants. He takes as a donor of one of the captured soldier named Carlos Blanca - Charly, it is one of the interesting changes of the director, in the game mutant was another man, but his name is also Blanca, in the game Charlie is the name of the soldier who was killed Bison, and for whose death now wants revenge him on another soldier named Guile, Charlie's friend. Also for example, the girl-fighter Chun Li in the film is the leading reporter, reporting from Shadaloo, boxer Balrog is the cameraman, and sumo fighter Honda a television director, they both leave a career and now work in television together with Chun Li. A excellent interpretation.Street fighters, main characters of the original game Ken Masters and Ryu, now deal with different kinds of fraud, they arrive in Shadaloo to crank out another thing, but to cheat Sagat and his men they have not come out. Sagat decides to use them as gladiators. But during the first bout of Ryu with champion Vega, the building bursts Colonel Guile on the self-propelled gun, and arrest everyone. Now Guile wants with the help of Ken, Ryu and Sagat to find the lair of Bison and rescue the hostages. Parallel to this, Chun Li and her friends prepare his plan of salvation. This is very well thought out story. Like in the game, Ryu helps Ken, to make the right decisions.It should also be said that Steven was able to skillfully use the elements of fighting in the story with gun shooting, explosions and chases. In the film there are all super attacks and the habits of the characters, and the actors are strikingly similar. Best turned out Vega - very quick and plastic fighter in the mask and with a glove with blades, which brilliantly played the Jay Tavare, the character literally stepped off the screen of the arcade machine. The same can be said about Zangief, naive strong man, who, being a kind man, foolishly went to serve for Bison.Guile is well played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, in the film he has a short haircut, which in principle is right, because he's military. From Major, he became a Colonel, he perfectly fulfilled all the incredible techniques of this character from the game. But personally I very liked Damian Chapa in the role of Ken, he gave the character a more natural image, a kind of merry rascal. Well, and actually, this actor always liked me. General Bison is great played Raul Julia, this is perhaps his best role, the last role unfortunately, the actor died two months after the completion of filming, the film is dedicated to his memory. As always at Steven De Souza, a very competent humor, really funny in many scenes and dialogs. The film does not become too comedic. All perfectly balanced. He also wrote the title song and exciting radio-remarks. Great Graham Revell music, perfectly emphasizes the atmosphere and morale of the film. Especially managed opening theme, and the theme of sending of the AN(Allied Nations) soldiers.A movie that may many teach the younger generation, an example to follow.

(that's 'Allied Nations' - think United Nations, but with a different name) task force of soldiers against the warlord dictator of (made-up country) Shadaloo, namely M. Bison. The 'Mussels From Brussels' is joined (and hindered) by almost all the other main Streetfighters (not that any fighting is ever done in any street, but never mind...).Unfortunately, what the film does well in coming up with a coherent and (nearly) believable story, it lacks in what fans want to see. Sadly, none of the actors are particularly good. There are too many characters and none of them are given enough screen time to particularly develop their characters. Plus many of them don't really look much like their on-screen counterparts. Not only that, but their computer-generated incarnations are also better at delivering their lines. The actors' dialogue is pretty clunky and cringeworthy. However, all this could be forgiven if the fight scenes were better. Okay, so it was released a few years before The Matrix redefined martial arts battles, but the fights are more similar to old James Bond fights where people just roll around on the floor a bit. The 'special moves' taken from the arcade are pretty hard to spot and, despite having a pretty big budget (for 1994), it makes you wonder where it was spent.So Streetfighter is a pretty bad film. And I still love it. Maybe because as a teen I played the arcade, or maybe because Kylie looks pretty hot as Cammy. It's camp, it's stupid, it's mainly for die hard fans of the arcade. If it ever finds a new audience, it will probably be with twelve-year-old boys as they would find it pretty much action-packed and exciting.The Matrix it is not. Stupid fun it just might get away with, even if Mortal Kombat is actually a better film.Don't be too harsh on it - at least Raul Julia gives one hell of a cape-swishing performance in his last ever on-screen role.

On the one hand as an adaptation of the famous game is not true, but as film itself, however, is very funny, precisely because it does not take itself seriously.The problem is that given a perhaps too caricature parody or tone, rather than as a one hundred percent serious film in every way. The film has humor, but went with it, so that really was hard to take it seriously. Then there's that created a sort of parallel universe, many characters changing sides and giving them a different role or the video game as Balrog, Sagat deejay or appearance. However, it is not an absolute mess, as entertaining as it is quite drinkable. Among the most positive, we can say that the film is so psychedelic and surreal and such a colorful and lively picture that is nice to see, as a kind of bizarre comic. The presence of Raul Julia, his gestures and exaggerated poses and a great and wicked sense of humor, a dictator are the most memorable of the film, and in fact the character of bison is really the only well-focused and tailored all film. Van Damme is on his line, he does what he does best, and even like him for the way he laughs at himself. Actress Ming Na, however, I find it much more believable and sexy as that Kristin Kreuk ChunLi, but putting it as a journalist was a total mistake, journalist should have been a simple camouflage to infiltrate the fortress of bison as part a plan of interpol.

Well, the Street Fighter series of games are just pure amazing. Like seriously, they're so entertaining and they're full of combat and action; obviously because you're pitted against another character, from the game, and you fight each other. It's similar, yet very different in more ways than it is similar, to Mortal Kombat and Tekken. Mortal Kombat is the same, after the games came, the films came....and they were meh. Street Fighter is a lot like this, except the Street Fighter film, for a start, is somewhat different from the games. Jean Claude Van Damme stars as Col. William F. Guile and might I add, is not too bad as him. It could've been worse....trust me. The film has a lot, but not all, of the characters from the Street Fighter games; main ones being Guile and M. Bison. It also has the likes of Ken, Ryu, Chun-Li, Blanka and Honda. What this film fails in though, is it's directing, it's overacting and uncalled for shenanigans.....which by the way aren't funny at all. The often terrible dialogue and stupid-looking martial arts scenes could actually have been a lot better; and by better, I mean they could have took more time into making the fight scenes look more realistic and not cheap and crappy as if they're being thrown back, slowly, by a tug-rope. when certain characters, such as Bison, get kicked back.One thing I love about the film though is, growing up with it was good, and it's good to look back at those memories because certain scenes of action were actually fun to watch when you were a kid. Quite a lot of stupid mistakes in the film too, that could easily have been edited out, as it's their job to do so. Overall though, i would rate the film a 5.5 out of 10. 5.5 you might wonder to yourself? well, since it stars JCVD, Raul Julia and the stunning, younger Kylie Minogue. Some parts of the film are entertaining, but other than that, it's a pretty-poor adaptation with a lot of mistakes and uncalled for scenes, pretty terrible choreography and overreactions from lots of the cast.

The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment.Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in Last of the Mohicans (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser. Never have I seen so many good actors wasted in a movie.

I vividly remember spending many hours bashing buttons and whooping my sister's ass at Street Fighter 2 on my faithful Mega Drive so surely a movie version would be equally kick-ass, especially considering the scribe behind Die Hard would be responsible for the film. What could go wrong? Well, other than casting, scripting, directing and producing then not much else, I suppose. I wasn't expecting much given this film's reputation but what little fun was to be had was mainly for laughing at it rather than with it.In the south-east Asian country of Shadaloo, the armed forces of General Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) are running rampant. When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well.Street Fighter is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel. And this is one of its biggest faults - the game admittedly lacked the po-faced seriousness of Mortal Kombat (which was an equally disappointing film as well) but this feels like a straight-up comedy, were the laughs any good. But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a Resident Evil movie but making it like Shaun Of The Dead! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved.There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults. So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.

Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess.

Of course, I am a fan of Jean Claud Van Damme and the late Raul Julia, but the choices for the other cast of characters could've been more thought out! Raul Julia did add flare of drama to the scenes with his menacing portrayal of Gen. Bison, but it seemed too bad he wasn't trained to fight like Bison actually could. Van Damme's Col. W. Guile was pretty good where fighting was concerned and his acting had improved some from when he first started. Although they all had good acting ability, the martial arts left something to be desired. I almost cringe, anymore, when the media announces another Street Fighter title, and I cannot decide whether or not I actually want to go see it.

Hated by street fighter fans and those who are not. In terms of expectations, the fans wanted the shoto centric characters to fight in a tournament where plasma is thrown freely. They wanted all the special moves and the original story lines intact, the costumes and the exact looks. Probably wanted Japanese subs as well if not the whole movie.Instead they got one of the loosest adaptations to come along. Something so far out of street figther it baffled them. And so in their ignorance they shouted BOOO and all claimed Hollywood was hurting their precious franchise.But when I watched this movie I expected something dumb and colourful. A few fights her and there some nice sets. I got way more than I bargained for. The movie blew me away with how outlandish it was to the point of being cartoony. The characters were so exaggerated as to have trivialised the plot. Fight scenes took weird turns where the fighters tried to outdo the other. Dialogue was chock full of the most quotable things to have you asphyxiate under the strain of hilarity.Everything that went wrong in this movie somehow enhanced it. It became a joy to delve into scenes to pick apart the small out of place details in a where's Wally like quest.This movie can only be described as so bad its good. So out there in both bizarrely and ludicrously that somehow it was all funny. I guess the interpretation is varied. In the mood of watching something serious, slapstick may seem inappropriate and yet the laughter here is so funny as you don't expect to laugh.The fact that the movie has only a passing resemblance is but a blessing. It could tell a story no one would care for and yet push characters into the scenes which gave whole new reactions.A faithful adaptation would have only given what was already there.I would be hard pressed to enjoy viewing the fights over being able to play out those fights myself. The story played by real actors with silly wigs talking in the the silly Japanese stock phrases such as growing stronger would have been annoying. In the game the story could be ignored but a theatrical version would try and be so faithful as to remove that luxury. Pitting all the character with their stories intact for the goal of fighting would mean they might not be able to do much else. To put it plainly fighting games including street fighter have poor plots. The nerdiness of the video game would still come across to the general audience. Fans were selfish enough to think the film should be just for them.This film turned those weaknesses into strengths. By changing the characters whilst exaggerating the more core characters the film became a far better showcase. The games already give plenty of coverage to the shoto's so a film where Guile and M.Bison square of is refreshing. Raul Julia plays M.Bison with such zeal in what it the realised parody of a deluded dictator. From the Nazi skull hat to the sweeping cape, M.Bison is played so grandiose that his insane schemes seem hilarious. Raul Julia, one of the best actors puts his full effort into this swan song. For nothing else of street fighter the movie was about him. Van Damme's guile has a french accent for an all American soldier. He has good chemistry with Raul Julia who exchange insults and threats like a wwf showdown. The whole film pivots on this epic confrontation of the two opposing characters. Everyone else does a decent enough job.So what wins the film for me is mainly the funniness of the whole movie. They didn't care for a poor story but they were creative enough to play on the aspects not fully realised in the video games. Many people will not forget the memorable quotes and scenes used in that movie. They may insult it whilst slightly snickering or they may hold their noses high. Even some will say this film killed Raul Julia. I like to think he lived a completely different life during that movie. The movie which should be by all accounts bad is still enjoyed by some.

When I saw it, though, it was pretty disappointing for what I was expecting. The movie could've have been much better in so many ways.The basic plot is that M. Bison is trying to take over the world with his minions, and Colonel Guile is leading the allied nations forces against his forces. Some other street fighter characters are in the allied nations army. Otheres are civilians with personal vendettas against Bison, others are cons forced into the mix, and others follow Bison.The acting is pretty bad, and I'm not just talking about Van Damme. The only actor who was really good was Raul Julia, perfectly cast as the evil Bison. Some of the others were not good or bad. Also the storyline is very clichéd with many jokes/plots/lines that have been vastly overused or are ridiculous. A good example is where the spokesman for the allied nations says he stopped Guile from taking all the soldiers, and there's 1 cook still on the base. Another example is when Guile has to pretend he's been shot, the medics don't even try to perform CPR or anything. The plot where it looks like the allied nations won't attack was way too quick. It should have been a at least a few minutes long where the characters had to think.The film's worst problem, which defies logic of a Street Fighter movie, is the lack of action. There should have been intense, lengthy fights scenes coming every which way! Instead we are treat to a bunch of quick fight scenes with only a few moves per fight, some of which are not choreographed well at all. Some of the characters from the game don't even throw a single punch! The best fight, and the only one that was really good, was the final fight between Bison and Guile. It was pretty intense and well choreographed. However even it has a flaw. Bison is supposed to be an extremely tough and skilled fighter who can shred any other street fighter. But for a good portion of the fight, Guile is kicking his butt with almost no problem.The plot of the game Street Fighter is to fight off 12 opponents in order to confront and beat Bison. This movie should have been nothing more than all of the street fighter characters entering a world combat tournament and trying to get the chance to defeat Bison. Throw in a few few vendettas and personal reasons to want to defeat Bison, and some dramatic dialogue between actors after the fight scenes, and you would have a classic adaption from the game.

The characters were written differently from what I knew, and that irked me. I'm used to Chun Li working at a hotel in Hong Kong, not as a journalist trying to defeat Bison, same with Cammy being a lieutenant for the AN rather than an assassin. Also, having Jean Claude van Damme play Guile was rather funny, especially since he speaks with a European accent and in the movie Guile comes off to me as a hardcore patriotic American colonel for the AN with the American flag tattooed on one of his arms. (He tried though. At the end of the day, he tried.) The special effects also bothered me, like during the fight between Guile and Bison, and Bison had those electricity sparks around his chest; however, the movie is twelve years old, so I can't really expect them to be excellent. Bison's life support system underneath his clothes bothered me as well. I don't like god modding like that. In the end it was pretty enjoyable, but it's not one of the movies that I would watch five times over or until I get sick of it.

And for the rest of the other fighters, their background stories are also fake and very hard to believe. Basically, the whole movie from start to end was very boring.

Now older and (slightly) more mature, I can point out some of these movie's flaws accurately. First off, the campy style, as funny as it may be, takes away from the gritty and dark attitude that video game of Street Fighter II conveyed. Too many one liners, and predictable reactions are present. POSSIBLE SPOILER ---When Bison tells orders Chun-Li be taken into his personal quarters, E Honda and Balrog struggle harder in the same cliché way most heroes do when a villain is taking a female member of the team---- Some of the choices for actors were also under par, like Van Damme being Guile. I understand he's a kick@$$ action hero, but the guy is not all American, which is what Guile was all about. The portrayal of Sagat was disappointing; he's supposed to be a terrifying 7 foot tall menace, not some weak looking failed businessman. Removing Fei Long altogether was understandable, but Blanka should've been more prominent, rather than some odd rehash of Charlie and the Brazillian beast. Making Dhalsim a doctor, with NO powers at all, does not do justice to the real Dhalsim. I liked this doctor, but I want to see Dhalsim! Some of the characters were okay though; Dee Jay made a surprisingly good villain, Bison was well chosen, and Zangief was hilarious, but that's about as good as it gets. This movie also lacked any special moves at all, I mean understand they were on a low budget, and it was nearly 12 years ago, but come on, you can have a corny movie with cool colors, a cool movie with no colors, but you can't have a corny movie with no colors and expect people to love it (colors means ha-do-kens by the way). The only move they tried to portray was Bison's psycho crusher, and that kind of failed. Although the game was amazing, this movie should only be watched if you're not expecting the glory of the game, and can take this crap lightly. I feel like a teacher who has failed a student...

What really killed it was when the fight started with Ryu and Vega and he did that sorry-ass Hadou-ken which was nothing but a camera flash. The whole plot just screwed the movie up. The only things that the movie got right was Zangief and Vega. Zangief was a big, brainless brute who indeed did work for Bison. The guy they had to play Vega fit his entire profile. He was a pretty boy and he had the fighting techniques from the game down somewhat.

The action scenes look like SNL sketches. There is no character development whatsoever. None of the women are naked. There is more right-wing propaganda than you can shake a stick at(which of course, I missed when I was 12) The characters actually use phrases like Thrust kick! I could go on.

The moves are done exactly like the game, and the casting was flawless(other than Guile's hair, of course). Considering that Street Fighter II is part of my psychology now, this element will always be cool to me. Sure, a lot of fans don't agree with this, and will complain about how Cammy's background isn't exactly like the cheese in the game, but since any time not spent beating those a******s is time wasted, we'll move on.

Don't try to cram every character into the movie.  SSF2T from which the movie is based has 17 playable characters.  As a result we have cameo after cameo with a loosely strung together excuse to get them on the screen at the same time.  Select an elite few and form a good detailed and intricate plot around them, then you can slide in plotless references/cameos of other characters without taking up any exposition time.  This will increase chances of the film's success, and it also leaves room for a sequel!Lesson 2.  Games usually lack in the plot department.  Especially fighting games.  Liberties here and there are tolerated, but when half the characters are rewritten and the entire  plotline/premise of the game is altered then you start running into problems.  Sure, it's okay to tweak a few things and make Chun Li a reporter, but when you rewrite Honda, Ryu, Ken, Blanka, Dhalsim, Zhangief, Sagat, and Balrog?  This is like a corny fan-fic where you take your favorite game character and throw them into a stupid sit-com situation.Lesson 3.  Bright colors work in comic books and video games . . . not in movies unless you're doing a kid's movie.  Granted Street Fighter has kids in its audience, but Mortal Kombat and X-men do too.  Even if de Souza wanted the movie to come across as camp, it ended up campier than he could have anticipated, and that killed any hope the movie may have had.  Mighty Morphin Street Fighters?  I dunno . . .At least the very next year the game-to-film adaptation genre would receive some redemption with the far superior and  probably one of the better translations, Mortal Kombat.

Hell even the obliquity romantic subplot is pushed so far into the background so as to be almost unnoticeable. It's not a laugh a minute, but some of the lines did strike me as funny. Yeah yeah I have a lame sense of humour, but it's not like I get to choose what I find funny.Neither of these two points are any reason at all to watch the film. There is in fact only one reason to do that. Raul Julia. Wow. If you're playing an insane megalomaniacal villain you have to go all the way or the whole thing falls down. Raul Julia goes all the way, then a little bit further. The screen positively lights up when ever he's on it, frankly the film is worth watching once just to see him in action. I would go as far as to say that Bison is now one my favourite film villains ever, and the only thing that stops this film from becoming utterly forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it's still a bad film, but Raul Julia's performance prevents me from hating it.I am surprised to see it so widely panned. C'mon, it's a street fighter movie, what did you expect?? You didn't go into this looking for an emotionally moving experience with numerous fine understated performances, and if you did you're a moron.

A+Guile - huh?? Who cast Jean Claude Van Damme as an American soldier? Once you get past his accent though, he turns in a fair performance. Make no mistake though, that accent is very distracting for the most part. Weren't there any American action guys (with smaller salaries) available? C+Cammy - again with the casting. Why is Kylie Minogue playing a British solider when she's Australian? Granted the American audience won't notice, but it was bothering me for the whole film. Anyway a small part, and again a fair (if dull) performance despite the accent. CKen + Ryu - well their both fairly interchangeable (hey just like the game). They both look fairly good in a fight (or at least their body doubles do), and when their required to actually say something they do a fine (albeit bland) job. C+Zangief - the main source of the comic relief. Hey I liked this guy, and the accent actually fits! Wow! B+Dee-Jay - apparently he's the computer guy. Huh? So why's he called Dee-Jay? The name made much more sense in the game. A lot of his part consisted of having to look at Zangief when the Russian makes a stupid comment. Not very demanding, but he it done well. BE.Honda - this guy sucks. Only the Godzilla reference while fighting Zangief was funny. Otherwise he was just another good guy. Ho-hum. DBalrog - like E.Honda. only without the funny Godzilla bit. D-Vega - well he's not in it very much, just around for the fight scenes which make assessing his character difficult. Still, from what little we got he was good. CSegat - suffered from being the second villain to Bison. Hell anyone would have paled next to that, but the fact that you actually noticed Segat in comparison says a lot.

I admire the producers drive to want to make Street Fighter into a live action movie. I really do, but there were so many things wrong with that I don't know where to even start. Well first of all (a bit of repetition a head), everything was backwards. I can't even say backwards; they just stuck people in roles the producer wanted them. Ryu a hustler? Not hardly. And Vega hispanic instead of Spanish? Don't think so. They had a cast full of notable actors, but 1.) many of them were not suited for the role (first thought that comes to mind is Wes Studi -most notable for playing Geronimo- playing Sagat), and/or 2.) their true talent was suppressed (such as Ming-Na who played Chun Li). The producers should have really thought about this one before they made it.I don't want to continue with this rant because I know I'll end up spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it (as if I hadn't already).

Kylie Minogue is in it too, I noticed, but she's not really for the acting department, she's better off as a singer anyway.  Everything has managed to be kept in similarity to the game unlike other films based on games (check out my other reviews).  There is nice sound in the film, plenty of action and a storyline that makes it worthwhile to be watching it, as Master Bison is smuggling weapons, instead of just a plain old fighting tournament like Mortal Kombat.  IMHO this film deserves more than a crappy 3.1 as a rating - I'd give it 6.5.  It's a pretty darn good film but after you watch it three times or so, you can quickly get bored.

I personally believe this movie is mostly under rated because of its video game connection. Since its release, I have seen it several times and each time it becomes a little more entertaining. This is because the movie is really built around Raul Julia's stellar performance as the quintessential, over the top megalomaniacal evil dictator M. Bison. Van Damm Plays a likable, but cocky, driven tough good guy that exists as a supporting protagonist for Julia (its all about the bad guy). The rest of the supporting cast play small parts that are probably based on the video game but are well enough integrated into the plot not to set off major alarm bells. Several minor characters really add a twist to the irony like, the pacifist Dr. Dhalsim, the simplistic Zangief, the geeky Dee Jay, and others, give Bison's organization a corporate/Nazis feel and make Bison's warped dreams possible. Guile's timid bureaucratic superiors unintentionally aid Bison through appeasement (Chamberland/Hitler). But, back, to Bison. Bison violates almost every rule in the evil overlord rule book, which makes SF a must see for B movie buffs. And, If one reads the personal quotes used by the most unsavory people who ran/ruined the world in the 20th century. The similar type of quotes are used by Bison as all his dialog. My personal favorite Bison line about burning a village is;For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me... it was Tuesday. There are also several art/decor references to serial killers and dictators (i.e. Clown pictures/Gacy). For the teenagers there are explosions, fights, and cheesy jokes. For the adults there are enough scientific/ethical/moral/historical undertones to make it passable as a cheesy what if story. Strip the comedy, the silliness, and the absurd extremes, you would have a James Bond-ish film based on current world events. In a way, SF is a little like Casino Royale (1967), laughable, yet held back a grade (Production values and music) for being the class clown that no one takes serious. SF is not very deep, but it's not shallow. Like nachos, don't ask which wine it goes with best.

Van Damme is as wooden as ever, but it's hard to believe that the disgustingly poor script can make it seem any worse.

Their story of the two gifted Shodoken fighters (one absorbed in the pursuit of the ultimate fighting skill, one self-absorbed and fun-loving) is far more developed than Guile's shallow backstory (basically an excuse to put an American in a Japanese game).  Why do you think all of the new characters in the sequels are Shodoken fighters, not marines?  2)Street Fighter is a fighting game.  Apparently the creators of this film interpreted it as a military shoot 'em up, since we see far too few intense fight sequences and far too many dumb action movie conventions.  3)Chun Li is a perky detective, not a mature news reporter.  I'm not saying that Ming Na Wen isn't attractive (far from it, she is beautiful), it's just that she isn't Chun Li. 4)Charlie is a dead marine, he is not alive, and he'll never be turned into Blanka. 5)Dhalsim is a Yoga master, not a brilliant scientist. 6)Guile is an American marine, not a Belgian kickboxer. 7)...Why bother?  I could go on for years and still not fully describe what is wrong with this film at a conceptual level.  Still, the Super Mario Bros. movie had absolutely nothing to do with the game and still proved to be an interesting vision (If a much maligned box office failure).  I have no idea why the SMB movie is more hated than this one.  Street Fighter throws all of the good points of the game out the window and replaces them with horrid direction and acting.  Yes Raul Julia is a great actor, but he is a horrid choice for M. Bison.  Bison is not an intellectual Viva La Revolucion style dictator.  I always pictured him more along the lines of the Street Fighter anime's MWAHAHAHAHA type of all-purpose evil villian.  But even if you think fanboys like me are full of it, I can assure you that there is no pleasure at all to be gained from Street Fighter The Movie.  Avoid this film like the plague.

Double Dragon, Final Fight, Golden Axe and then came Street Fighter II and blew everybody's socks off so it was only a matter of time before a film version was made but I don't think anyone expected it to be this bad.Just to clear things up, I adore low budget 80's and 90's action/martial arts films. They have a quality that is so pathetic and funny yet is backed up with tremendous action and fight sequences and the reason they are like this is because they are trying to be serious. Street Fighter has none of this charm! The film was not made to be good, it was not made to stand the test of time or reach for any awards or even please fans, it was simply a quick cash making effort with the name of an immensely popular game.For a start the film looks dreadful! A scattered assortment of tents, boxes and scabby buildings make up the wobbly sets giving the whole film a cheap and grubby look that just doesn't work at all. Seriously, King Of The Kickboxers probably had a fraction of the budget of this film and looks 10 times better with genuine Thai locations and vastly superior fights. The costumes all look like they were made the night before by the cast's mothers and aside from all looking far too new, they don't fit very well and would be better suited to a high school pantomime.The script is laughable, chock full of crap one liners, crowbarred in to attempt to get the 8 year old's in the audience to laugh and probably failing miserably. Then comes the changes, the many changes! Street Fighter II should have been what the game was, an Enter The Dragon style tournament which, while not being original in any way, would have more than kept the feel of the game rather than the crappy dictator style story. Ryu is now an American, Guile is now Belgian, Sagat is Native American Honda is Hawaiian, Dhalsim a Doctor....OK the last one wasn't so bad and I sort of liked the crossing of Guile's friend Charlie with Blanka but it was handled in such a shallow, Batman & Robin sort of way that all credibility was taken out. Vega does look pretty accurate I will admit but doesn't actually do much.The fight scenes are few and child friendly (e.g. short, boring and fast cut!) I was shocked to learn that the action was choreographed by the great Benny The Jet Urquidez. A superb martial artist and star of many Hong Kong martial arts films and names including Jackie Chan, but I have s suspicion that the studio told him to calm it all down.It's really hard to like Street Fighter, even as a bit of fun because it's such a poorly tacked together piece of filmmaking that simply doesn't care about whether it is a quality product or not.The wonderful Raul Julia does what he can with the horrible script and actually looks like he is having fun with it. Kylie Minogue looks very hot in a uniform and she's always a joy to watch but that's honestly the best things I can say about the film.If you haven't seen it, then watch it and see for yourself and then watch the infinitely superior Mortal Kombat film which not only manages to be a reasonably faithful conversion of the game but is a great looking action film in it's own right with really some decent fight choreography and special effects (for the time!)If you really crave Street Fighter II specific action on screen then I highly recommend the superb Street Fighter II anime film which pulls no punches and is almost infinitely superior to this garbage in every way including fight scenes, story and accuracy.

As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all.The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed.I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.

A lot of people said it was terrible. I finally saw it on TV in the mid-nineties, and I have to say, I wasn't great, but I wasn't nearly as bad as everyone said it was.The movie is set in the fictional country of Shadaloo, and involves a military showdown between the Allied Nations strike force, and the terrorist army of M. Bison. Bison has captured a group of hostages and will execute them if the A.N. doesn't give in to his demands (typical terrorist threat). Col. Guile steps up to face Bison. Also, other characters from the Street Fighter game get involved either by accident or on purpose.I completely agree that the movie has many gaping plot holes, it's not always coherent, and many parts come off silly. I know most fans were hoping for a serious action movie as opposed to a campy spoof, but in all honesty, it's still entertaining. I think they were trying gear it more towards kids and that's why it was so campy.Quick! Change the channel! Omigosh! That has to be one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life.One thing I would like to address Many people claim that his was the movie that tainted the image of Raul Julia. I disagree. If you watch closely, you can tell he's lampooning the role. The result, Bison comes off as a humorous cross between Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, Saddam Hussein, and Dr. Evil. It was great. Van Damme does a good job as Col. Guile. He definitely a great job on the fight scenes. Ming Na Wen probably does the most believable performance as Chun-Li, who is probably the most credible character in the movie.Bottom line While this movie has a weak plot and cheesy acting, it's so silly, that it becomes a so bad, it's good movie.

Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) and his troops are trying to stop an sadistic evil General M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his men. Since Bison has kidnapped tourists for $20 Billion Dollars in three days and he also has Guile's close friend (Robert Mammone) kidnapped as well. But there's trouble in the way, when an mysterious reporter (Ming-Na Wen) and two crew members (Grand L. Bush & Peter Navy Tuiasosopo) wants to kill Bison for personal reasons. While two con-artists Ken (Damian Chapa) and Ryu (Byron Mann) find themselves caught in the middle between the good and evil. Guile needs to find Bison before he murders the hostages and takes over the world.Written and Directed by Steven E. de Souza (Who wrote action films like Commando, Die Hard, The Running Man) made an intentionally silly movie, based on a hugely popular Capcom video game. Julia is actually the main reason to watch this absurd feature, since it was one of his last films. Julia does has his moments in the movie and he gets some of the biggest laughs in it. Same goes for Andrew Bryniarski (Best known for playing Leatherface in the recent The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and prequel) as Zangief, who's playing not as bright bad guy. But it's actually de Souza's script and some of his cast hurts the movie badly.Van Damme is certainly miscast as the lead and he's never believable as the American Colonel due of his Belgium accent of course. It's bizarre seeing Pop Star Kylie Minogue as Lieutenant Cammy, who gives the worst performance in the feature. Even Minogue admits that as well. The best acting from the film besides Julia is Roshan Seth as the sympathetic scientist/doctor and Wes Studi playing one of the main villains in the picture. Since Street Fighter was made for kids, the script could have used more imagination and better written as well.It is not a total waste, thanks to good production values and most of the cast tries hard to make it work. But in the following year Mortal Kombat was much more successful and better than this campy movie. Street Fighter over the years does have some loyal fans, even those who enjoyed watching bad taste in horrible movies. I find it watchable but it is not the kind of picture, i want to play it on my DVD player soon.From the Van Damme Quadruole Feature, DVD features an clean non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.351) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Collector's Edition of Street Fighter wasn't anamorphic as well. From watching the film, it sure does looks like a mess. Which it explains they were five editors working on this picture. Producer Edward R. Pressman (Conan The Barbarian, The Crow, Wall Street) produces better features than this one. Fans of the video game will be more forgiving at this failed attempted to be a good kids movie. But it should have been much more darker and a lot less campy humour. Super 35. (** ½/*****).

The material, in terms of story-line, characters, etc, really doesn't lend itself to movies. However, that's never deterred even somewhat ambitious studios out to make a quick buck and, in rare instances, these studios unintentionally create a gem.Street Fighter is not a movie to be taken seriously. The plot is unimpressive, the casting is terrible, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a line of dialogue that can be spoken with a straight face. However, all of these seemingly awful elements come together beautifully in one of the greatest examples of camp that the movie industry has ever churned out. Almost every line is quotable due to how unintentionally (or maybe intentionally) bad it is. The entire movie is basically one huge comedy with three minutes of seriousness, in the form of a speech, towards the end with intermittent fight scenes.Fans of the Street Fighter franchise will, most likely, hate this film on general principle. Producers cast the physically diminutive Raul Julia as the power-mad General Bison, relative unknowns as Ryu and Ken, few characters resemble their video game counter-parts (Jean-Claude is possibly the closest fit), and the writers took many liberties with the characters' backgrounds. Likewise, fans of action flicks will be unimpressed (or possibly even annoyed) by the lackluster fight scenes, weak (but strangely hilarious) story, and the like.However, despite (or rather, because) of its flaws, this movie is a great laugh and I'd highly recommend seeing it with a few friends just so you'll have someone nearby that you can turn around to and ask, Did he really just say that?

This one, however, tops them all in the way of being sheer nonsense, and here's why.This movie simply has no cinematic merit. For starters, the filmmakers' first mistake was making a movie based on a video game. Their second mistake was casting non-actor (and non-martial artist) Jean-Claude Van Damme in the lead role. Their third error was casting Raul Gomez Addams Julia as M. Bison, the evil leader of a subversive group who is trying to take over the world, and can only be stopped by Van Damme and his tight-knit group of chop-socky film rejects. This should be enough to deter any film-goer anywhere, but wait, there's more! The plot goes like this M. Bison has gained influence in the southeast Asian country of Shadaloo. He has taken hostages and demands $20 billion ransom, giving the AN (Allied Nations) 72 hours to comply. American Colonel Guile (Van Damme, who sounds more like Ricky Ricardo than any American) sets out to defeat Bison and free the hostages. He does this with unimpressive (and very few) fight scenes, bad dialog (Bison you have made me a very happy man! Guile and next, I'll make you a dead one!), and excruciatingly bad acting. Brilliance, no less!What was anyone thinking when they made this atrocity? Even Wes Studi, the only real actor in the film, sinks to new depths, especially when you consider his involvement in good movies like Heat and The Last of the Mohicans. How this movie ever got produced is simply beyond me.All in all, this is quite possibly the worst movie of the 90's. Raul Julia died shortly after this film was released, and I think I know why (anyone who did so much as operate a boom mike for this film probably became suicidal after it came out.)

I just don't figure why van Damme didn't quality-check this crap out of his movie portfolio. The only good thing in this film is Zangief, and that is only because he was so stupid and funny.

However, I recently saw this movie again and I can't find a single reason why. I've always been a Street Fighter fan, and this movie is just an insult.The basic story Bison is a bad guy, Colonel Guile wants to stop him. More or less accurate to the game, but that's pretty much where the similarities end. First of all, if you make a movie about street fighters you'd think it would make sense to actually include actors that can fight. Van Damme (Guile) can fight, but that's pretty much it. Because of this, the fights suck obviously. This movie should revolve mostly around the fights but there are only a few and they suck. The Street Fighter are known for their signature moves, and there aren't any. Sure, Ryu puts his hands in a familiar way and you see a blue flash, and Cammy (who the hell casts Kylie Minogue in a fighting roll?) yells Thrust Kick while she kicks a random bad guy in the face, but that's it. Obviously they wanted all characters from the game in it, but they didn't know what to do with them. So T.Hawk isn't a huge native American who wants to take revenge on Bison, he's a scrawny dude under Guile's command. Dhalsim isn't a Yoga master, he's a professor who happens to know how to make big green monsters with red hair. (sounds familiar?). So they changed all this to fit all characters in it, and still Fei Long (the only actual movie star from the game isn't in the movie) is missing, but I suppose that's a good thing.So in short, they changed everything there is to change and more, the acting sucks and the fighting sucks even more.

Everything, including the wafer thin storyline, seems to be randomly woven around the characters and it just results in absolute chaos.  I can't imagine what was going through the writers minds as they decided to cast E. Honda as a be-shirted Hawaiian van driver and Balrog as his cheery and lovable accomplice who just happens to box, not the brutal Tyson like boxer we were pitted against in the games.  Ken and Ryu, the central protagonists of the SF games were blatant mockery in the film; a couple of bumbling crooks who attempt to swindle arms dealers by selling them Nerf guns. What???  These two were the heroes of the game - every kid wanted to be either Ryu or Ken, and here they are just presented as a couple of smarmy cowards.  Guile's role was also far too central, but obviously this is due to Van Damme's selling potential.  Blanka, arguably the best character in the game, was also pretty useless in the film, his history also changing for no reason.  (No longer a mutant raised in the Brazilian rainforests, but now Guile's comrade Charlie curiously mutated into Blanka, despite the fact Charlie was just murdered by Bison on the &#145;official' story.)it really irked me that most of the characters just seemed to have been there for the sake of it; Dhalsim for example appeared to just be an ordinary doctor, and not being able to find a place in the film for our elasticised voodoo practitioner, they simply named the guy Doctor Dhalsim.  Pathetic! Oh, and costume.  What the hell was happening there??? Again, going back to Dhalsim, throughout he's a very Indian/Asian looking Doctor, and then at the end, for no reason whatsoever, he's suddenly bald and kitted out in some of his tribal getup.  Also Bison's trooper uniforms just happened to match the colour and styles worn by Ken & Ryu in the games, both men inexplicably given different colours just so they looked a little more like their pixelated namesakes.  Balrog also appeared in his full boxing outfit for no reason, as did Zangief in his little red hot pants. *shudder* I also hated the pointless little tangents that were intended to give the film some form of remote depth; Dhalsim's moral dilemma, the A.N. ordering Guile to cancel the attack resulting in Van Damme's moving little speech etc.  That horrible little bit where Guile lets slip to Bison that he knows Blanka made me cringe also, how contrived and artificial did that need to be? Arrrgh!Sagat and Bison were both portrayed with reasonable accuracy, and possibly the only people on the set who could act.With all things considered though, Street Fighter is an incredible good laugh to watch.  I really have to remove myself from both the original SF games and standards of good cinema to do so, but I usually end up enjoying it, although admittedly not on the intended level. I'm in stitches every time I see the comically tragic flaws in the character writing and the absurd and incomprehensible paradoxes always bring a great big grin to my face.  The shock value in realising the film really is that bad, is comical in itself.  Yes it angers me, but the unintentional laughs are plentiful and for that it deserves a little credit.

The thin story has Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme, complete with a bad dye job and American flag tattoo) attempting to rescue relief workers held hostage by General M. Bison (portrayed by the late Raul Julia, always a professional to the end) in the fictitious Southeastern Asian country of Shadaloo. Guile is in charge of a military force, called the Allied Nations, that has been recruited to defeat Bison. I guess we're finally at peace, because apparently every world leader could afford to deploy hundreds of their soldiers to some destitute armpit of a country to fight someone wearing a red leather suit and cape.While the plot is simplicity itself, it's too bad that the other 99% of the film is an utter display of stupidity, such as having the ethnically diverse cast portray characters of totally different races. For example, Native American actor Wes Studi plays a character of Thai descent, while casting Belgian Van Damme as gung-ho patriot Guile makes as much sense as having Ronald McDonald play Norman Schwarzkopf. It's a wonder that writer/director Steven E. de Souza didn't make someone show up in blackface.Never mind that Street Fighter is based on a game built around the martial arts, because there is virtually none of it to be seen anywhere. There is an incredible amount of gun violence, and of course the good guys are perfect shots while the baddies couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. Guile even holds off over a dozen of Bison's henchmen with a bottomless machine gun clip &#150; as he sits out in the open, no less. Meanwhile, two soldiers, each armed only with a handgun, are able to confront an entire army equipped with AK-47s.The ending is pathetic. Try to keep a straight face when Guile gives a pep talk to a group of soldiers as they gear up for the big showdown, or when he says to Bison, This is the collection agency&#133;your ass is six months overdue, and it's mine. Besides rampant intercutting between several inferior fight scenes, the lousy showdown between Guile and Bison consists of an incomprehensible and dizzying hodgepodge of fast edits in order to conceal Julia's stunt double. (During this contest, the 180-degree rule is broken quite often in one scene, Guile is facing screen right as he attacks Bison. After a brief cut to Bison, Guile is suddenly facing screen left.)Plot holes are as abundant as the story's lack of coherence. For instance, the AN soldiers navigate inflatable assault crafts &#150; complete with outboard motors &#150; through a river that leads to Bison's fortress. Not only is the word inflatable misspelled on every one of the boats, but how could those huge motors fit in the flat carrying pouches, and how were they able to inflate all the boats?On a closing note, here's an interesting bit of trivia In 1999, de Souza had an equally lambasted script for another video-game-to-film adaptation rejected. That movie was Tomb Raider.

Chun Li a reporter? Balrog her camera man?! No, no NO!

Their casting decisions might be considered mediocre at best as well. Thank God that time where Hollywood had to cast a well-known figure as leading role has somewhat passed. Jean Claude is a sucky Guile if I've ever seen one.

It's either good acting, great direction, perhaps an involving plot, explosive action, or possibly humor.  Street Fighter possesses absolutely none of these elements.  Hence it totally fails in all catagories.  Overall, the casting was terrible, save a few minor characters and Raul Julia as Bison.  But I mean, the popular Ken and Ryu play limited roles (oh and their outfits are prison uniforms in the movie) and instead they substituted a Frenchman (JCVD) to play the heroic Guile as the main character.  How stupid.Not only that, but nearly all the characters in this movie are American (so much for the World Warrior gag).  And half of them don't really fight. Perhaps the biggest problem with Street Fighter was that they tried to put too much of the game into the movie (and they didn't do a good job of that either).  They tried to fit in too many characters, who mostly do nothing but let you know that they're in the movie.  But there is one very retarded part in the movie that tried too hard to capture the essense of the game Bison remotely tries to kill Guile using a joy stick controller with a large camera display (just like in the arcade), while Guile is in a hovercraft.

Those who grew up or were around during the big home console boom have even very probably played some version of Street Fighter 2 to death and know the characters quite well. And to those, it will be blatantly obvious how -wrong- this choppy adaption of the game is. People bad-mouth the Super Mario Bros movie for being too loosely based on the games, but the Street Fighter film is much worse in that department. So much in fact, that this almost looks like an alternate universe version of the Street Fighter saga, and not a very pretty one either.As usual with videogame adaptions (especially fighting game ones), one shouldn't really expect anything of earth-shattering levels. Most of us will be satisfied just to see the characters from the games fleshed out on the screen and strutting their stuff for a bit. Well, not so here. There's some kind of silly plot going on about rescuing a bunch of hostages from flipped dictator wannabe M. Bison. Oh well, any excuse would be good enough to have the characters from the games appear and beat each other up, but the movie starts to do everything frighteningly wrong almost right from the start.Primo, some bright spark decided that almost all the characters had to be completely changed from their game selves. I'm all for originality, but this just ends up looking embarassing. The grim and mighty Sagat from the games turns into a dopey-looking smuggler of sorts, Ryu and Ken are cast as bunch of semi-outlaw ruffians instead of the worthy warriors we know (also note that the Yank actors don't even know how to pronounce Ryu's name. If I was called Ryu, I'd slap the face of someone who called me Rai-yoo), and it goes on and on. To fans of the game, a lot of this will seem terribly clumsy, if not downright insulting to the characters they know and love. Beefy Russian Zangief was never a faithful servant of Bison's, and neither was Dee Jay (Balrog the boxer has also changed sides suddenly and is one of the goodies...and a news reporter at that). The whole shebang just seems like a total mess, thrown together after just playing the game for two minutes. The way Blanka and Dahlsim were turned into complete farces speaks volumes.It's doubly painful to see how shoddy this has become when you consider how easily all these mistakes could've been avoided. Unlike a number of other game adaptions, there is some simple, yet solid base material for a film to be found in the Street Fighter games. The movie could've taken on a more linear path, describing a big martial arts tournament just like in the games, where everyone has their own (sometimes slim) reasons for competing and taking on Bison. It would perhaps have been unoriginal, in a Bloodsport-on-acid kind of way (side note; Bloodsport actually reminds one much more of the Street Fighter games than this film, with a world warrior flavor clearly present in there), but at least it would've done it's job of turning a game into a film properly.The way it is now, the character's names and costumes are the only slight similiarities to the games (plus a few teeny-tiny references). Overall it's just a messy and corny film, that's more like a trippy action movie for young children rather than a film based on the games. It doesn't even resemble a martial arts movie very much. Sure, there are fight scenes, but they're not quite Bruce Lee (Fei Long is missing from the movie, by the way), and are hampered by cheesy lines and dumb hampering around. Most of the action you get here would feel more at home in a standard run around and blow everything up kind of film. This is not so much a Street Fighter movie as just a forgettable action/warfare film on caffeine.Although the cast features some big names, one really has to wonder who came up with the bright idea of casting Raul Julia as a flipped dictator (who's even supposed to be a grandissimo martial artist. No, seriously). It's nice to see Van Damme again, though the day-glo yellow rinse they did for his hair won't go down well with everyone. And seriously, if you're going to star him in a film, at least have him strip off large amounts of kit at some point.In a nutshell, this is a travesty. The film fails miserably at everything it tries to do. Still, at least there's an anime version of the game (several ones, in fact) that does a more faithful and overall far better job, I'm told. Just goes to show you that Japanese games are better off being adapted by Japanese studios. Or studios who have some kind of clue, for that matter.

All three basically have the same problem in common - the plot of the movies has little to do with the video game, which may turn off most viewers familiar with each series.Granted, I was expecting Street Fighter to be a high-impact movie laden with special effects and spectacular fight scenes, but this film delivered on neither. The only convincing fight scene was the showdown between Guile and M. Bison (and even THEN, I wasn't convinced).There were lots of inaccuracies in this film (that only hardened Street Fighter purists might notice) - for instance, Dhalsim as M. Bison's evil doctor, E. Honda's character being played by a Samoan, Balrog holding a gun (with his boxing gloves still on, no less!). And whoever did the casting for this film should have been fired immediately after the film was completed! OK, OK, so maybe there were a few casting accuracies (Ming-Na Wen as Chun-Li, and Raul Julia (God bless his soul) as the sinister M. Bison), but there were a few BIG misses (Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile, and Peter Tuiasosopo as E. Honda --- they don't really fit their characters) that couldn't be overlooked.I can't say that this is the WORST video game-themed movie ever made, but I'd give it a 4, because it did manage to retain some of the game's hotness.

By far, one of the most horrendous films ever produced, the truth is this could've been a great film to watch. Sadly however, the martial arts fighting style has been mostly watered down in favour of ammo, guns and bazookas. As for the cast, I beg to differ when in comes to criticising the cast choices; likewise, Cammy- she is supposed to be British and so she has an English accent and yet who plays her role? Kylie Minogue, of whom is in fact an Australian and is more famous for her pop career than a film one. If I was the director, I would've hired Tamzin Outwaite who used to be in the British soap opera east enders, as a) she's blonde and b) she's a Brit. As for Guile, Van Damme? Are you sure? He has a Belgian/french accent, for goodness sake. I would've had Dolph Lundgren instead, never mind Van damme. Okay, Lundgren is from Denmark but he sounds more American than Van Damme does. And instead of Ming-Na Wen for the role of Chun Li, I'd have Zhang Zhi in her place. I have nothing against Ming, as i think she is very talented and deserves better than this tripe but rather I'd have an actual Chinese born actress playing a Chinese Born character. Speaking of Chun- Li, whoever thought of the idea of her being a news reporter?! That is so ridiculous. As others have said on here, Guile was never the main character in the game- and yet to the directors, they thought that because Van Damme was more well known and recognisable than Kylie and the others in the acting, sorry film world, they thought we might has well have him as the main focus of the movie. The inconsistencies in this flick are there for fans to see. The fight scenes are almost laughable to watch.

Oh, it changed my life.  It changed everyone's lives.  Why?  Because it was an amazingly addictive fighting game with cool moves, cool characters, and cool graphics (at the time).  It truly changed the face of video games for ever.  I was so excited about the movie...Well, it's horrible.  I mean it's really, really, really, bad.  I'm talking worse than Super Mario Brothers bad.  Okay, where's the main problem (among many) Jaun Cluade Van Damne.  How many people out there like this guy.  Okay, the two of you go somewhere and die.  Now who thinks he is a horrible actor who is also bad at martial arts mostly due to the fact he is getting too old?  Okay, that's about 2, maybe 3 million people.  I didn't know that many people came to the IMDB.  Anyway, the man is down right one of the worst actors of all time, right next to Daulph Lundgren.  And guess what?  He does a bad job in this movie.Okay, next problem.  There are too many characters.  Aparently, whoever made this movie decided to put EVERY DAMN CHARACTER FROM THE GAME INTO THE MOVIE!  Only really good directors can handle a large amount of characters.  Well, guess what?  This guy sucks, so he failed at his job as well.  Oh, and none of the characters are very interesting and I really don't care who lives or dies.I will say one thing.  Casting Raul Julia as M. Bison was a nice touch.  The man is a good actor and he shows it.  Too bad this was his last movie.  If he were still alive, he'd kill himself in shame.So, other than that, is there ANYTHING to savor about this movie.  Well, it does have a cool high tech boat.  And the fight sequences are... wait a minute.  The fight sequences suck too!  There only a few seconds long and they're horribly done!Okay, in conclusion this movie suffers from too many characters that the audience couldn't care less about and that no one put any effort into this movie to make it any good.  I guess it's pointless to say that the plot is SOOOOOOOOO stupid.  If you thought that Mario had a dumb plot, oooooo boy, wait till you see this.  No, wait, don't see this.

It's a simple story with a simple theme-good vs evil.Set in a parallel or future Earth, a war rages. General M. Bison (Raul Julia) is the megalomaniac who desires world domination but believes his purpose is just and noble. Colonel W. Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is the UN Commander out to stop him. All fans of the game, look out for Ryu, Ken, Vega, Sagat, Zangief (a dumb follower of Bison), E. Honda, Balrog, Chun-Li (a reporter), Dhalsim (a doctor) and my favourite character, Blanka (who is a loyal friend of Guile). Featuring a cameo performance of Joe Bugner (an Aussie boxer) and starring Kylie Minogue (an Aussie singer), the movie leads to a final showdown between Bison and Guile.Entertaining, funny and always corny, Streetfighter is a lighthearted movie, in my opinion, solely aimed at the fans of the game, videos and figurines. As for those who have no background of the film, watch it but don't expect to see a meaningful film-it's an action vehicle for Van Damme and Julia (RIP).

I, for one, loved it.  The game and the movie can be two separate worlds, and still get their points across.  (Sorry, Disney's Inspector Gadget doesn't count)I read in a Gamepro magazine from July, 1994 where Steven E. De Souza (director) discussed some details in this movie.  He did say that all 16 characters would appear, though some briefly.  This movie wasn't trying to be a clone of the game...it was trying to exist on its own terms and merits, off today's headlines, so a few changes were made.  (I appreciate originality) The problem they did have was, the way this movie was being made, they had too many heroes and too few villains, so, to make this movie work, they needed to make a few changes.  Some characters will switch sides.  (ie. Balrog, the American boxer, known to the Japanese as M. Bison, is now a good guy, while DeeJay and Zangief, the kickboxer and the Russian, are aides for Bison)  In the October 1994 issue, a later annoucement was made that everyone but Fei Long would appear.  (I'll discuss it later)  But, still, most of the other characters do appear on their respective sides, in one way or another.  Guile, Chun-Li, Ken, Ryu, Honda, Dhalsim, Cammy, T. Hawk and Blanka are all good, while M. Bison, Sagat and Vega are still bad. Also, I do like the new story they gave Blanka.  The options were a young boy named Jimmy lost and raised in the jungles of Brazil, or a soldier named Charlie (Guile's friend in the game, who Bison murders)taken prisoner and mutated into a beast.  I mean, the former is something right out of Tarzan and the Jungle Book.  The latter plot must have pleased the CapCom execs, otherwise they wouldn't have permitted it!I see Sawada as a stand-in for Fei Long.  If he was in this movie (a Hong Kong movie actor) he'd probably get a wise-guy personality, making him like Ken Masters, the less serious of the two Shotokan students, and Johnny Cage of Mortal Kombat.  It wouldn't be Street Fighter without Ken, so, no Fei Long.  All in all, this is a cool movie.  Better than the Super Mario Bros. and Double Dragon movies.  And unlike Mortal Kombat, it can work on its own, without the game behind it.  It may be mindless fun, but hey, at least it's fun.  I thought Van Damme made a good Guile (he seems to stand up for everything good and right, making him a well-respected SF character), and Raul Julia really went out with a bang (no pun intended) as evil Major Bison.  If you can, also try the American Street Fighter cartoon.  (I have a comment on it, too) And if you hate this movie still, you'll love it after Paul Anderson releases that Resident Evil movie.

My analysis? The movie is too smart for the reviewers.If Street Fighter was simply a serious action movie, than it would be lacking on several levels. However, Street Fighter is not a serious action movie. In fact, the movie is a parody of every action movie, and ultimately a parody of itself.Imagine being a writer and being told to write a script bringing together such random characters as the Russian Zangief, the Brazillian monster Blanka, the Thai kickboxer Sagat, and all-American Guile. What would you do? It would be nearly possible to create a serious and realistic plot from this. So the clever writer, de Souza, didn't. He made fun of the randomness of the game by creating a story that was paper-thin and dialogue that made no sense but sounded like action talk. The result was one of the funniest comedies of all-time.My evidence? Examine this line.Bison Why do they call me a madman? All I want to do is create the perfect genetically engineered soldier.That line, delivered by the amazing Raul Julia, summarizes the perfection of this movie. It is a hilarious and fitting line.Above the obvious humor, there is also a level of subtlety that is very amusing. Some of the jokes are hard to catch unless you've seen the movie 184 times, like me. For example - the text on the boxes that the AN troops are loading reads Inflatable Assault Vehicle. And during the prison break, Vega pulls out a prison claw, made from sticks and twine. These moments are nothing but comical genius.The bottom line is that Street Fighter is a beautiful and perfect movie, one of the only ones that I have ever seen. The only problem is in the ignorant viewer, who can't appreciate humor at its best.

Unfortunately, the movie attracted mainly people who expected cruel, violent massacre and were angry not to see it - an audience obviously not high enough to see and appreciate dozens of little jokes scattered throughout the movie (there are some, which are quite obvious - such as the parody of Japanese monster movies from the 1950s - and others, which require a more careful look - such as the lovely scene with the drawing, a parody showing Bison as Hitler, with a similar creative ambition and similarly ridiculous results!). The script was apparently too good for most of the audience who expected more of a violent fight such as Mortal Kombat the Movie - which those people obviously liked more. However, unlike any other fighting films, this one you might show to your kids and people who dislike fighter films - that is because Street Fighter is a harmless fighting comedy rather than a violent fighting action feature.

The whole game was about colorful characters fighting with each other &#x96; that's it. Not really a material for good and serious movie. Street fighter is quite obviously aimed at kids. The whole story (bad guy wants to rule the world) , the dialogues , the humor , the costumes , music and art-direction are proof of that. The movie makers assumed that little kids are the fans of the video game , so they made movie aimed at them. That's why the movie is so bad.Fans of the game weren't happy with the movie , since it took some liberties with the characters and story. It works however as a decent adaptation. It presents quite many characters from the game that are quite well written into the story. Most of the characters did look like themselves or at least tried to.The movie has it's share of memorable and funny one-liners and dialogue. For example  Quick , change the channel , I guess you didn't see that or Bison's speech about burning the village.The best thing about this movie might is probably Raul Julia (The Addams family) performance as the evil general Bison. Julia understands perfectly the whole B-class movie style and is simply adorable in his performance.Jean Claude Van Damme , Kylie Minogue and the others are terrible when it comes to acting.There are some little jokes hidden in the movie - parody of Japanese monster movies from the 1950s , lovely scene with the drawing , a parody showing Bison as Hitler. You can even hear the voice of who was the main hero of movie Good morning Vietnam If nothing else this a so bad , it's good  type of movie. You will get quite a lot of cheap laughs of it. It's definitely more entertaining that many of those serious and professional movies. It never takes itself too seriously and it's so silly that it's almost an art.

And it didn't have Van Damme. Now you can sit back and relax and let the storyline take over! The plot involves General M. Bison (Julia) who wants to take over the world using genetic supersoldiers such as his guinea pig Carlos Blanka, but stopping him in his quest for world domination is Colonel William F. Guile (Van Damme) and his team of Street Fighters which include all the classic characters you know and love from the game, such as Ken, Ryu, E. Honda, Balrog, Cammy and Chun Li. Some of the evil characters are Zangief, Sagat, Vega and Dee Jay. They obviously took some liberties with the good and bad characters from the game. Naturally, Dhalsim is a scientist (with no stretching power).The 90's gave us some classic video game movies besides this one, such as Super Mario Bros.(1993), Mortal Kombat (1995), and Double Dragon (1994). What a golden time for unabashed cash-ins.When Van Damme isn't wearing his blue beret, we see that his hair is red. Not only is this the only movie to date where he is a ginger, As we all remember, Guile in the game is blond. A Van Damme highlight is when he says Bison...how many children are you going to orphan...I'm coming to get ya Bison! and then flexes his muscles in strange meathead fashion.Raul Julia as Bison once again proves the old adage Never have a last movie. See Raw Nerve (1991) for more information on this. After a speech about stoicism he then proceeds to chew the scenery to pieces. But what would you do in his situation? You have to feel somewhat bad for Julia, but he seems to be making the best of the situation before his tragic death. There is a point in the movie where we see an artists' rendering of Bison as a sad clown. Huh???!!?? Bison's suit has rocket boots and a CPR function. In other words it inflates in and out very funnily. His big line in the movie is GAAAAAMMMMEEE OVVVEERRRR!!!! You gotta love it...I think.Street Fighter is tailor-made for dumb-dums. Everything is spelled out for you. When gas floods Bison's HQ, Honda proclaims It's gas!!! When Chun Li jumps out of a window, Honda yells out She's gone!!!! Either Honda is a big moron, or he thinks the audience is.The budget must not have allowed for Dhalsim stretching, ha-do-kens and sonic booms. All the characters at least attempt to say their catch phrases. However, one of the most disappointing things about the movie is that E. Honda failed to do his classic move, the thousand-hand slap. Why even make a Street Fighter movie if that's not in it? The movie almost justifies its existence when at the end, all the heroes jump up in the air and shout Yeah! and there is a freeze-frame. Then the title comes up (sans the subtitle The Ultimate Battle, inexplicably seen during the opening titles). This is a great fan-favorite technique.After Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter is the second best video game movie of the 90's!

However at the same time they is something strangely compelling when watching film.The story of the film is an international peace-keeping force is sent to a fictional country in South-East Asia. This force is led by Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme (a bad Beligan actor playing an American)). His mission is to help stabilise the nation after the overthrow of the director M. Bison. Bison has an evil plan to regain power of the country and then world dominion. He kidnaps civilians and he demands $20 Million and all the Allied Nations forces to leave the country in 2 days or he would start killing them. Instead of giving in, Guile leads his forces to fight back against the villain, like the American hero that he is. Ryo and Ken are involved as well, but they are con-men in this film, who are involved in the underground fighting scene before getting involved with Bison. Blanka is also in this film as a part of Bison's evil plan, where he hopes to make to super-soldiers that would help him on his quest.There are a lot of problems with this film it is poorly written and directed. They is so much going on that it easy to get lost and lose interest sometimes less is more when it comes to film-making. The acting is terrible, the action is sub-par, only Van Damme is any good at fighting. It also has too many characters from the game, which ends ups people not caring for some of them. It would have been easier to just have a few of the major characters from the game and focus on them. As well the film is disloyal to some of the game's characters, especially Ryu and Ken, who were not lovable rogues but good guys in the game. Balrog was also made into a good guy, when in the game he was bad game. The filmmakers also seem to be on a mission to have as many nationalists as possible and be a politically correct as possible. It adds to a scene of unintentional humour. The film is funny but for the wrong reasons. It is like a car crash, you know you shouldn't watch it but you can't help it.

There are moments when things don't suck all that much. The real problem is that Street Fighter is so cheesy and ill considered that you can't believe that a) the movie produces would release it to the theaters and b) that anyone who wasn't a 14 year old male arcade dweller would ever pay money to see it. Consider some the inherent problems in making a quality adaptation of this game to the silver screen. First of all, you need at least a dozen male and female actors in good enough shape to at least LOOK like martial artists. You have to work up some decent fight choreography incorporating both wildly diverse martial arts style and the 'over the top' stunts that are only possible with wire works and CGI. You have to come up with a story that gives all these characters something to do, and you have to do it in a way that caters to the demands of the original fans of the fighting game. You have to have actors who can pretend to fight, or at least fighters who aren't total stiffs on camera. And (if background info on this movie is accurate) you have to try to do it on the cheap, sparing every expense. Street Fighter solves none of these problems, except for the cheap part. Instead, it goes for camp from the very start, and aspires to be a 1990s version of the original 1960s Batman movie (the one with Adam West, Caesar Romero and Eartha Kitt). It features Jean Claude Van Damme (a fighter who can't act) and Raul Julia (an actor who can't fight) mouthing some of the hammiest, corniest dialog in the history of cinema and forces them to do things neither of them were suited for. It features a plot that would have been rejected by the story editors of the old Republic serials. It utilizes virtually none of the the signature moves and styles of the supporting characters from the video game - the actors basically do ballet at each other while the camera cuts around to make us think that actual fighting is taking place. And the SFX and costumes are so cheap that you long for the purity of the hand drawn animation and character designs of the original games. I will say this for it, though - there are two or three moments in the film that are actually funny - most of these belong to the actor who plays the hulking Russian Sambo expert Zangief as a dim-bulb for comedy relief (BTW the movie never mentions that he practices Sambo). My favorite line in the movie belongs to him - You get PAID ?!?! That line and the way he delivers it add an extra star to the rating. Do NOT approach Street Fighter as anything other than purest Velveeta cheese food product, and you may be OK. Even then you may get annoyed enough to turn the DVD into a Frisbee and sail it out the nearest window.

I can't say that often enough. Every line, every moment, and every explosion is awesome. Sure, 'Street Fighter' may push the lines of silly comedy into inept stupidity, but I love it.

Sure, there is a strange lack of martial arts for a movie based on 'Street Fighter' movie, and it displays some real miscasting, but I love it. 'Street Fighter' gets sillier and funnier as the movie progresses, and providing some really funny lines and even better scenes (the Godzilla scene between E. Honda and Zangief is my favourite).Watch 'Street Fighter' for laughs, and don't think about the game. In fact, don't think at all, just watch and laugh. It is a really entertaining film.

So much potential, but the film would rather wallow around in the cheesiest plot line ever...as opposed to giving fans a lot of kick ass fight scenes.The film attempts to throw a bunch of the popular video game characters into the film, if only to have them in there and nothing else.

Although, its a sad film for such a great actor to leave on (RIP). There's also some humorous moments (intentionally) that made me chuckle, but those moments also took away from the film at the same time.CLIFF NOTES hardly any real action, mostly some cheesy gun battles. when the fight scenes did happen, they weren't anything impressive...especially since most of them DIDN'T have van damme in them.

Bison, even if he isn't supposed to be as insane as he's depicted here. Also, most of the fight scenes were well choreographed. Aside from this, I must really take issue with all the creative liberties they took with this. It just didn't do the game any justice at all. The dialouge was horrible, a lot of the acting a bit too corny (except for Raul Julia of course), and I'm convinced that writer/director Robert de Souza just didn't care at all about either the game or it's legions of fans. I still don't know how Capcom could have approved this abomination. Still, it's pretty good for a laugh. That is, if you don't mind risking your sanity. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and stay far, far, away. By the way, what a waste of a great character like Blanka.

This is a great movie for action fans. Sure, it won't get a Grammy, but it's just a great movie dedicated to a great game.I know that many where disapointed when the Street Fighter movie came out. People said that it didn't follow the the plot of the game. I ask What was the plot to the game in the first place. The world VS Bison, enough said. Many say that the movie didn't relate to the game at all. I find that very untrue. There are many relations to the game. The costumes were very alike. Most were the same as in the game but with color changes. Chun Li's costume is blue, but in the movie it's red. Guile's is green, in the movie, it's blue. The costumes of Bison, Ken, Ryu Zangief, Vega, Honda and Blanka(minus the camo pants) are exactly alike. (I mean Vega's first arena costume not the one he has in the end of the movie.) There are a few other small things about the movie that relate to the game. The cage arena in the movie was taken from Vega's level where you fight him in a cage in the game. There is a little exchange of dioluage taken from the game that few notice in the movie. In the game if a character wins a match, he gives a little comment to his opponent. When Bison and Guile stare each other down for the final battle, Guile says his comment form the game. Are you man enough to fight with me? And Bison replies with his comment from the game. All who oppose me shall be destroyed. I thought that was an interesting dedication to the game. During the Vega, Ryu final battle, notice that Ryu uses a force ball like in that game on Vega. It's a half second flash but his hands are just like in the game. Vega also uses his roll n' stab move from the game a few times in the fight. The best example of how the movie relates to the game is Guiles legendary flip kick. It is amazing that Van Dam does this by himself, completely unaided. That was probable the best part of the movie, watching Guile using mostly authentic moves from the game to defeat Bison. My only disappointment was the under-rated death of Bison. I would much rather see him die from just unending beat down from Guile. It would have been nice to see him die from another flip kick or Guile's other classic move, the Sonic Boom. In all, this movie was very entertaining and I watch it a lot. others who like the game should at least watch it for what it's worth. it is a Van Dam after all.

This movie was based on the popular video game of the time and I felt it was portrayed well, the characters were all in it and on whole it wasn't a bad film.  Ok, enough of the professionalism this movie starred Van Damme as Col Guile and it was a terrible performance, for starters it was Van Damme and he didn't need to be made more of a fool but that hair colour and the script he was given made The Order look like a masterpiece (if you are wondering why I didn't compare it to Replicant just watch it and you will see why).  Some of Van Dammes quotes were just plain awful, F*ck you...Bison, you son of a bitch, yeah sound good quotes for an action movie but listen to him say them and you will hear what I mean with that accent.   It was very disappointing to see the character Blanka in this movie, he was like the anorexic incredible hulk, I detect it was just kylie manogue with her make-up on. As for Kylie Manogues acting in this movie, well lets just say Van Damme was an Oscar winner compared to her.   I'm still not sure what the story was about, oh yeah, rescue hostages or something, there you go; there was a running plot behind this trash.   I have seen worse (for legal reasons these movies will remain anonymous) but this movie was borderline Executive Decision (certain people know why I have chosen this movie), which makes it technically a classic in our books.

Made by Capcom, it's what passed for Tekken in those days although it's still kinda going now. It's a basic 2D fighting game like Mortal Kombat (without the gore) although 3D versions were released in the late 90's Playstation era.And yeah it had its moments. I remember Christmas 95' when the New Challengers version was released. Hours of fun of me and my brother kicking each others heads in over the second controller! Although one memory that it would do well to forget ever happened, would be the reason why you're reading this review in the first place, it's movie based on the series.Street Fighter the Movie is like the first turn on the left as you drive along Hollywood's tunnel of shame. With Red Zone Cuba, Manos and Gigli being at the far depths....but hey let's not go there of course. It is a truly awful horrible film that deserves no part whatsoever in anyone's movie collection, with the exception of Joel and the bots.I know I'm often one to talk about dubious achievements so I might as well get this little tid-bit out of the way. Street Fighter the Movie is the worst ever movie based on a video game. And the video game based on this movie, is the worst ever video game based on a movie! Amazing how it holds both titles.Remember how most sensible Batman fans felt after seeing what Joel Schumacher did to the caped crusader? That's how Street Fighter fans will have felt after seeing this hateful wreck. It takes all the characters, stories and personalities and puts them in a blender. And then decides to convey them with some awful F-Grade actors and terrible role play.Now one of the excuses that the producers of this mess gave was that they weren't sure how to fit people into roles and find the right actors with a low budget. Fraid that doesn't pass Pedro. Just look at the original Mortal Kombat movie. It was no masterpiece, but it still stuck the the roots or the games story and considering it was a low budget, they didn't do all that badly in terms or actors and personalities, and the finished product (although formulaic) was tolerable.Anyone who even has a rough idea of the Street Fighter games before this was released would be able to tell you the following three things. 1) Ken and Ryu are the main characters. 2) Guile is an All- American boy scout. And 3) Chun Li was one of the weakest characters in the game apart from her lightning kick.OK....So why Mr Director, even though even the most average gamer knows these three things, how come 1) Ryu and Ken take a back seat as B-characters?! 2) Guile is a muscle bound machine with a french accent?! 3) Chun Li is one of the best fighters?! To call the casting bad is an understatement! Which brings me onto the two main players in this debacle. Raul Julia and Jean Claude Van Damme. Raul Julia was ill during this movie and was in no position to play the top bad guy, M.Bison. Whose role is reduced from super-villain to a mere crime boss! And since JCVD is playing a character that he's nothing in common with, the result?....The final fight scene is basically JCVD destroying M.Bison.You're telling me that THAT passes as a final fight scene? Get out of here. As a matter of fact, I think I'll get out of here. Look at any other video game action movie, particularly Mortal Kombat or Doom and you'll see where this appalling movie went wrong.Don't Watch This Movie.

Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) disobeys orders & decides to attack Bison's hideout & take him down, however he isn't the only one who wants to see Bison dead & various assorted character's & fighters join in to help including boxer's, sumo wrestler's, karate experts & kung-fu kicking news reporters!This American Japanese co-production (it was part financed by Capcom who made the Street Fighter games this was based on) was written & directed by Steven E. de Souza & I don't quite know what to think about it. The film is based on the very popular Street Fighter series of computer games up-to Super Street Fighter II The New Challengers (1993) which I was a big fan of & without wishing to boast was pretty darned good at & I could complete the entire game without losing a single fight! The script tries to shoehorn every character in even if they don't have a particularly large role except that of Fei Long who is the only character from the computer game that was left out (the final boss Akuma doesn't really count!) which is odd because considering this is a martial arts film I would have thought he would have been the easiest to fit in being a straight Bruce Lee homage. As a straight action flick this is pretty bad, there's actually a distinct lack of action & not that much fighting either. As a film based on a computer game it's bound to upset some who think their favourite character doesn't get to do enough or fight enough & some of the character's seem surplus to requirements & are there purely to get name-checked. Having said that this is one of those so bad it's good type films, the best comparison to it I can make is the old 60's Batman TV series as they both have a certain embarrassing camp value which makes them watchable & it only lasts for just over 90 minutes. For those who don't know keep watching as the end credits roll as once they finish there's another few minutes as Bison's hand bursts through some broken monitors & rubble on the floor.Director Souza is more used to writing big budget action films rather than directing them & it show's, the action isn't anything special & as already mentioned there's not too much fighting. Some of the computer game character's look silly on screen, Balrog in his boxing short's & gloves looks stupid & where did he get them from? Sagat doesn't look like his computer game counterpart, Vega isn't right, Blanka looks awful, Dhalsim looks nothing like his computer game persona & here they turn him into a scientist for some reason nor does T.

There's nothing that violent here or particularly exciting & there's a lack of the character's special moves from the games as well.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 Street Fighter actually made triple that at the worldwide box-office even if it didn't deserve to. It's reasonably well made on location in Australia, Thailand & Canada & some of the sets are impressive but you can't help but cringe at the camp bits. The acting isn't that great, Raul Julia in his last film before he died is in top form, JCVD puts another nail in the coffin of his theatrical career while both Ming-Na as Chun-Li & Australian pop star & actress Kylie Minogue as Cammy are pretty hot looking.Street Fighter is one of those films I have a hard time deciding whether I liked it or not, I mean on the one hand it has a terrible story with stupid character's but on the other it's so camp & fun it's hard not to like it. I'll give it a straight down the middle 5 stars out of 10, I liked & hated it in equal measure. "},{"Title":"This Is Just Terrible.

The acting is painfully bad. The characters are badly written stereotypes, not to mention that the film obviously tries incredibly hard to implement all of the characters from the video-games in the movie, which results in far too many characters, and far too many supposedly interesting characters are pushed into the background and settle for cameos, to make way for the more popular characters. The dialog is awful. The script is horribly badly written. The humor is childish and lame. The film has so many unintentionally funny scenes that it must be a record of some kind. The fight sequences are predictable and, like I mentioned earlier, tame. There are also far too few of them, considering that it's supposed to be the driving point of the film, rather than the predictable and badly written plot. The film really doesn't have anything to offer, honestly. I recommend it only to huge fans of Van Damme, and kids/teens with nothing better to do than watch some badly choreographed fights by Van Damme and various badly trained actors.

As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts. (At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like On Her Majesty's Secret Service or Quantum of Solace. (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Raúl Juliá's characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juliá's final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series Neighbours), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. Street Fighter is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words based on a video game appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece. There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- Prince of Persia, for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clichéd, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn Street Fighter into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10 "}{"Title":"Why do they still call me a warlord, and mad?

In fact it's pretty bad, but part of me thinks a lot of them knew that going in, and they all managed to make the most of it. The lighthearted tone of the film really helps make it better, then it ought to be. I laughed a lot with some of Bison's cheesy, yet undeniably classic lines, and Van Damme showing off a comical side that is refreshing to see. A perfectly wooden, yet fun cast, provide many entertaining antics along the way. I enjoyed the chemistry between Damian Chapa and Byron Mann. They were natural together, and gave the movie a lot of laughs. The absurdity of the costumes worn in this movie, only made the movie that much more fun. Because you see, Street Fighter is all about the creativity, and cheerfulness. It was never meant to be a great movie, just a fun one, and I think they accomplished that well. The silly fight at the end between Guile and Bison, is the worth the price of the rental alone, it was a hoot!. This movie undeservedly gets too much flack for my liking, there are a lot of movies, much worse than this one.Performances. Jean-Claude Van Damme is certainly not good in the acting sense, but he is a lot of fun, nonetheless. His comical awareness is top-notch, and his silly bantering with the cast, gave me a lot of smiles. This is the reason I am such a fan of his, he is very charismatic. Raul Julia is great fun as Bison. It's a shame this was his last film, but he is the true Bison. Ming-Na is cute, and lively as Chun Li, I rather liked her. Damian Chapa and Byron Mann play off one another, wonderfully, I really loved watching them together. Kylie Minogue is pretty sexy, and most certainly wooden, but she had fun in her role, and that's all I wanted. Wes Studi is pretty good as Sagat, and did his job well. Grand L. Bush and Peter Navy Tuiasosopo are a lot of comic relief, and managed to be pretty entertaining. Miguel A. Núñez Jr. is silly and fun as Deejay. Rest of the cast are very lively, and do their jobs well.Bottom line. Street Fighter is a lot of fun, if nothing else. I'm aware it's a bad movie, but you know what? I don't care.

It has plenty of action. This movie is pre-special effects. This is what makes it so powerful yet so simple at the same time. It doesn't rely on effects--it relies on the storyline alone. For adults who were growing up back then, this is a serious trip down memory lane. You have to stop and ask--where were you when the Street Fighter movie came out? I suppose as hardcore gamers and fans, nit-picking is in our system. We expect video game movies to be right on the dot of the storyline within the game. We are disappointed when these expectations are not delivered. A good movie about a fabulous game really doesn't have to do so. Street Fighter proves this by taking elements of each character's story from the game and putting in on screen. It is a classic in its own right.

A stupid scene that was contrived to introduce the Ryu and Ken characters. Now in every other media that I have seen regarding Street Fighter (the game, the anime, the comics) these characters are rather complicated and are normally handled with care. They really don't come off correctly as goofballs. So I hated this interpretation of them. Van Damme was COMPLETELY miscast as Guile. With his accent there was no way he could have pulled it off. Guile's character is supposed to be the gung-ho all American G.I. Joe type. He doesn't even look like the video game character. They could have at least given him the big brush cut and the green fatigues. Sagat looked like an old man. Again...to the casting director...have you even looked at the video game character? He's freakin' huge. He's virtually all muscle. How can you miss things like that? Mr. Julia didn't fair much better, although I like him as an actor he just could not pull this off. Bison is a TOTAL psychopath, Julia gave it his best shot but really fell short. He doesn't particularly fill out the uniform either. The action was also too slow to do justice to the characters. Perhaps they should have thought about enhancing the speed. As for the other characters, I think there were just too many to build upon. I found it familiar to Mortal Kombat Annhilation where they were introducing SO many characters that it was hard to keep them straight. In summation, I didn't really care for ANY of the characters but Vega and Zangief were probably the best cast even though they were still misused.Now as for the plot, I still really don't know what the plot was aside from Bison taking over the world. Bison was dressed up as Hugh Heffner in one scene...maybe that was the plot...hard to tell.Things that stuck out 1. Most of the extras were wearing red uniforms...how convenient 2.

It was therefore only a matter of time before films based on actual video games, as opposed to based on the concept like Tron, began to appear. To say that this new sub-genre had a less than impressive debut is like saying that Star Wars A New Hope was a mildly unexpected success. When one views this example of the genre, however, one can see all sorts of reasons why.First of all, was it really necessary to include every character in the video game? Ken was often regarded as being unnecessary for the video game on which this dreck is based, and very few characters have any distinguishing characteristics. Guile could have had a chance to develop and show a personality, but they chose the worst possible actor on this planet to play him.To cap that off, the filmmakers make it clear in a hurry that they not only had no respect for the actual story of the video games, but for the slightest cultural details relating to it. Ken, in spite of being listed as hailing from the USA in the second video game, is actually Japanese. The bio given in said video game explicitly states that he is only in America to train against a wider variety of opponents. Someone also should have explained to the writers that Ryu is pronounced Ree-you, not Rye-you. That I know this in spite of not speaking a word of Japanese should tell you something about how much effort was put into this turkey.Raul Julia gets a thankless turn here as Bison, the evil dictator that took the story of the second video game out of the realm of mildly implausible and into the downright absurd. No explanation is given of who Bison is, what motivates him, or how he came to be the dictator of a satellite island of Thailand. This is acceptable in a video game, where stories are basically an excuse for action sequences. In film, however, where one is paying to basically see a story presented in a visual form, it is completely unacceptable.Making it worse is the fact that the action in the film is so bland and weak. If you're old enough to go and see a film like Hard Target or Face/Off, you have absolutely no reason to bother with this turgid effort. Not surprisingly, this was the beginning of the end for Jean-Claude's career, and it has more or less permanently crippled many others.All in all, I gave Street Figher a one out of ten. It was another eight years before they managed to make a decent film out of a video game. While this is no Wing Commander, it does come awfully close at times.
