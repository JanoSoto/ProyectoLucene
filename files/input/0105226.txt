There are some holes in here and some goofy parts that make you shake your head in disbelief.....but I haven't found anyone who didn't get caught up in this story. The movie has the right amount of action, suspense, plot twists and interesting characters. In addition, it sports some nice colors and cinematography plus a good guitar-based soundtrack. I labeled this crime movie a film noir because it's gritty and the all the characters are no good. Even the only supposed-good guy, played by Nicholas Cage, gets himself in trouble by lying and has a quick affair he should't have. He also does something at the end which isn't right, but I'm not going the spoil it by saying. Suffice to say, however, that the rest of the characters are so bad they make Cage look good!Speaking of bad guys, does anyone do it better than Dennis Hopper? Not many. At least in the deranged category, he's tough to beat. Lara Flynn Boyle is fun to watch for a bunch of reasons. J.T. Walsh gives another great supporting performance, too.This is one of those films that never got much publicity, but it should have. You'll have fun watching this. By the way, try saying the name of this movie out loud three times fast without messing it up!

Michael (Nicolas Cage) is a down and out, but honest, young man from Texas who goes west in search of work and money. He finds both, but not in the way he had expected.The film's screenplay contains plenty of surprises and plot twists. Excellent cinematography, adroit film editing, and moody western music add tension and suspense. The expansiveness of the big sky country provides a wonderful setting. And the acting ranges from good to excellent, with great performances from Dennis Hopper and J.T. Walsh. Dwight Yoakam's specially recorded country/western song provides the film with a strong finale.Correctly labeled as neo-noir, Red Rock West strikes me as being something else, as well. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and improbable timing, so much so that others may regard the screenplay as flawed. Ordinarily, I would agree. In this case, however, when combined with the moody atmosphere, and the fact that the small town of Red Rock seems almost empty of normal daily life, the coincidences and unlikely timing suggest a story that, beyond noirish, is ... surreal. It's almost as if fate deliberately intervenes with improbable events so as to force Michael to come to grips with himself. From this point of view, the coincidences are not script flaws at all. They are necessary plot points in a nightmarish story of a young man who must confront his own demons ... disguised as other characters.All we need here is Rod Serling, in a postscript, explaining, in his always clearly enunciated voice, that ... a young man, searching for himself, stops in a small, almost deserted town a thousand miles from nowhere. It's his final layover in a journey to ... the twilight zone.

Walsh as the heavy.  These are the types of roles these four can play in their sleep, and they have done so often enough that to see them playing them again borders on cliche. What a relief, therefore, that John Dahl, a master at getting a lot of mood out of a little action, directed this nuanced noirish thriller.  Hopper manages to keep from going over the top, Cage shows a little more depth than his usually-superficial action heroes, Boyle is by turns sultry, innocent, and scheming, and one gets a sense of the hard iron of the soul that is central to his character, Wayne.  Dahl's direction gives a sense of the emptiness of the Big Sky country where the story takes place while also being intimate enough to show how a wrinkled brow can indicate a radical change of plot in store. The plot twists are top-notch, and one of the other great twists in this movie is that some of the supporting characters actually act as if they have brains.  It isn't often that minor characters like deputy sheriffs have more brains than their headlining superiors.  But with a director as smart as Dahl, you shouldn't be surprised by the intelligence of anything connected with this film.  An excellent movie.

The movie even for its short length is boring. The other main problem is the phoniness of the script. What is this the Twilight Zone? He just cannot get out of town; everything works so he is trapped there. Only one other movie tried this and it is even worse than this Oliver Stone's stink bomb U Turn. That film makes his Natural Born Killers look like Citizen Kane. From the beginning, with his arrival, his being mistaken by Wayne as Lyle the movie's sense of reality is painful. If you were hiring a hit-man, would you want a bit of a physical description of him? Does Cage remotely look like Lyle? What because they both drive cars with Texas license plates? Are you kidding me, who believes this? This and the terrible acting, with the exception of Walsh, the only actor in the cast doomed the movie at the box office. Everyone remember the killer Bronson in the Mechanic? Would he have given a hitchhiker a ride? Chatted amiably with him and been thrilled they both were in Vietnam? How dorky!The contrivances to keep Michael in Red Rock would make Rod Serling say,forget it, nobody will buy that, too phony. The pacing of the movie is like geological time, sloow. Hopper wrecks the movie with his ham bone overacting like he destroyed Blue Velvet. From the moment they get Wayne at jail until the crappy scene in the graveyard; Hopper shows why you do not want him in your movie. He is doing Frank Booth light here; it is so obvious and it destroys any remaining reality of the film. Yes, when I am desperate and just got money to kill Wayne's wife, I always stop at the local Holiday Inn for some quick bed action? One ridiculous scene after another with some really bad acting by Flynn Boyle and Hopper lay waste to the film. I love anti greed movies like Sierra Madre but please the writing and acting here are not remotely in the same league. Bogie, Huston and Holt versus Hopper, Flynn Boyle and Cage, the latter shows why he is an action movie star. In drama, like Bangkok Dangerous he is out of his genre. Do not believe me? Watch Matchstick Men, it bombed for a reason. The greed message is lost among the wreckage that is this movie. When it was released it played at small art theaters for a reason, nobody would buy it for their big theaters. It was gone in a few weeks. Boring and slow like molasses, badly acted and written; it was held up as some wannabe Noir in color, no it is just crap, sorry.

It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and featured a marvellous cast including Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and especially J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance) making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed. The film never had much publicity on release (in fact I first caught up with it on TV) and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following.Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of Red Rock. Mistaken for a contract killer named Lyle from Dallas he is shocked to be offered $10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner Wayne Brown (the excellent J. T. Walsh). He plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double dealings - that Cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of! Then just to complicate matters even further the real Lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing (played by everyone's favourite heavy Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what has happened he goes after Cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow.Some favourite lines from the filmNicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle) I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money.J. T. Walsh (to Cage) Michael Williams. Well, Michael, you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this.Boyle (to Cage) You're not a killer?. Cage That's right, no. But the guy I'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here.Boyle (to Cage) O.K. How you're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking $10,000 from my husband?.An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (just 98 minutes) with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals. Any film featuring J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and Red Rock West was one of his best. How sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998. The most prolific period for film noir was without any doubt the forties but Red Rock West is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my Top Ten list of all time favourite films. I look forward to more like this from director John Dahl.  10/10. Clive Roberts.

It's impossible not to empathise with the honest, unassuming hero or to be gripped by the ways in which he tries to navigate his way out of the terrible predicaments that he finds himself in, so all you can do is fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride.The story of an ordinary guy who makes a poor decision and then finds that the repercussions propel him into an uncontrollable sequence of events from which he is unable to extricate himself is pure film noir. The same is true of the themes of murder, deceit, corruption and duplicity which are pervasive throughout. Many of the familiar noir visual motifs are also present, such as the way in which cigarette smoke is lit, the rain soaked roads at night, the heavily shadowed interiors and the lines of shadow (created by louvred doors) across people's faces.Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage), an injured war veteran without money or a job, stops off at a bar in Red Rock, Wyoming and is mistaken by the proprietor Wayne Brown (J T Walsh) for a hit man that he's arranged to employ to murder his wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Michael, a naturally reticent person, does nothing to disabuse Wayne of his misapprehension, especially as he could use a job and at first doesn't realise what he'd be expected to do. After having been told what his mission is and been given a $5,000 advance, he goes to see Suzanne and warns her about Wayne's plan. She doesn't seem overly concerned about the danger she's in and offers Michael double the fee Wayne had offered, for him to eliminate her husband.Michael decides to take the money he'd received from both parties and leave town. His plan fails however, when he accidentally drives into a man who is standing in the middle of the road and decides to take him to hospital to receive treatment for his injuries. At the hospital, things get more complicated when it emerges that the patient is Suzanne's lover and he has two bullets in his stomach. This leads to the local law enforcement officers getting involved and the revelation that Wayne is the Sheriff!! From this point on, things get even more complicated and also decidedly more dangerous especially when the real hit man, Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper) arrives on the scene.Red Rock West has some great moments of suspense, (an example of this is the scene in which Michael makes his escape from Wayne's bar) and also some great performances from its very strong cast. Nicolas Cage's expressions are extremely natural and convincing as he reacts to a variety of situations with anxiety, surprise or uncertainty and J T Walsh is also particularly good as a deceptive character who's always concealing more than he's actually saying. Dennis Hopper is intensely threatening as the vicious contract killer (a role he plays with great gusto) and Lara Flynn Boyle looks suitably cold and calculating as the femme fatale. Dwight Yoakam also provides some good support and moments of humour in his cameo role as a no nonsense truck driver.Incredibly, Red Rock West was originally destined to be denied a general cinema release but has justifiably emerged from its modest beginnings to eventually be recognised as the great movie that it really is.

It stars Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle, J. T. Walsh and Timothy Carhart. Music is by William Olvis and cinematography by Marc Reshovsky. When a promised job in Wyoming fails to materialise on account of an injury sustained in combat, Michael Williams (Cage) drifts into the town of Red Rock and is mistaken in a bar for a hit-man hired to kill an unfaithful wife. Tempted by the high cash on offer, Michael plays along and promptly finds himself in a web of intrigue from which escape is looking unlikely&#x85; Welcome To Red Rock/You Are Now Leaving Red Rock. The studio didn't know what to do with it, a neo-noir flavoured with contemporary Western spices. Put out on cable in America and thriving on its limited release in Europe, it started to gain a cult fan-base. More so after a theatre in the Frisco Bay area started showing it and it made considerable coinage. Today it still remains more of a cult piece than anything else, which while it deserves more accolades and exposure, is still kind of nice for the fans, because it's like we have our own little neo-noir treasure all to ourselves. Red Rock West is essential for the neo-noir heads and well worthy of inspection by the average modern day crime film fan. Plot wise it's a bit, shall we say iffy? Yet the twists, turns and characterisations are so deftly constructed and performed, it matters not a jot. Cage's ex- marine is an honest and decent guy who whilst down on his luck - punished for his honesty - finds himself in a vortex of mystery and murder that he can't escape from. His companions in this scenario are film noir staples, the femme fatale (Boyle) with a smoulder as big as her secret, the hit-man (Hopper) with a glint in his eye to accompany his callous leanings, and the shifty bar owner (Walsh) trying to off his wife whilst keeping his shady cards close to his chest. As the tricksy plot unfolds in a haze of bad judgements and untruths, further pulsed by the vagaries of fate, it becomes apparent that Dahl wants us to know it isn't taking itself too seriously. There's a glorious scent of dark humour hanging in the air, an unpretentiousness about the whole thing that's refreshing. The look and feel is perfect for the narrative, the colour is stripped back to create a moody atmospheric surround, while the score and sound-tracking immediately brings to mind country and western tales of woe. Dahl knows his noir onions, but this is not just a homage hat tipper to the past, he understands what works in noir, be it the blending of the quirky with the edgy, or scene setting in locales such as a colourless bar and a foggy cemetery, Dahl gets the key ingredients right to deliver the goods wholesale. The small cast come up trumps. Boyle as Suzanne Brown is weak if her femme fatale is pitted against the likes of Matty Walker or Bridget Gregory, but it's an adequate performance that doesn't hinder the picture. She is helped enormously, though, by having to share most scenes with Cage who brings his A game. Consistently inconsistent throughout his career, Cage, when on form is a joy to watch, here he gets to thrive as a put upon hero, shifting seamlessly between confusion and boldness, where incredulous looks are the order of the day with a side order of eccentric intensity. Hopper does what he does so well, amusing villainy, while Walsh is effortlessly menacing and suspicious. In small secondary support Carhart and country star Dwight Yoakam leave favourable impressions. This is not an edge of your seat thriller, or a cranium bothering piece of dramedy, it's neo-noir done right. Where morality is grey at best and money is the root of all evil, it's slick, playful, cold blooded and absorbing.

It wouldn't stay in theaters very long because of the distributor's money problems and lack of promotion, but they said it deserved better.The next afternoon, I followed their advice. They were right, it was some of the most fun I have ever had at the movies.  As some readers point out, there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes don't ever seem to end.

In a current contemporary world of American film-making, and one that was almost certainly predominant at the time of Red Rock West's inception, how wonderful it is to uncover a film that refrains from the over indulgence of extravagance and the ideology that awe is built on a foundation of overkill and visuals. That's not to say Red Rock West is without extravagance nor awe, such is Dahl's ability, that the film is full of a number of various incidences and twists that are exactly these things and gotten across by way of little more than a glance from one of the character's or an individual cut of the camera. When we hark back to America's independent cinematic boom of the late 1980s and going on into the early 1990s, certainly a boom that saw a number of films and individual directors both honoured and recognised on the European film circuit at the top level in a series of Golden Palm nominations, the displaying of Red Rock West shows we must not glance over the name of Dahl when speaking of both the films and directors of that era, namely the Coen Brothers; Steven Soderburgh; Spike Lee and Tarantino, et al.The film revolves around Nicolas Cage's character named Michael Williams, an ex-Marine of American nationality down on his luck and strapped for money in the dusty outback of Wyoming. He lives out of his car; uses random road side troughs full of water as makeshift sinks and struggles to find work, the latest failing being a construction site job that doesn't come through, although later on, he'll find ample opportunity at constructing something a monstrosity of a scenario for himself. Unbeknownst to us at the time, he's going into the misadventure he'll come to have with a prior tragedy of having served time in the Vietnam War, but suffering during this stretch at the hands of a missile attack on a base in Lebanon he was positioned at which forced him into enduring a glut of both chaos and death. The event that may very well lend itself to Williams' dishevelled and down-beat tone and attitude, something Cage pulls off in that naturalistic manner he's done so on occasion since, shares eerie parallels with what will come to unfold around him as another glut of death and chaos unfolds around a man who has signed up for something you only realise you don't want to be anywhere near when it gets ugly as 'wrong place &#x96; wrong time' scenario once again kicks in.The devilish premise sees Williams pretend to be the Texan hit-man an apparent bar owner named Wayne (Walsh) called for some days ago so as to do some local dirty-work he wants taken care of. His looming over a seated Cage whilst in the office an early establishing of power, the sort of power that he'll come to have over him as Williams is forced throughout into proverbially dancing to the tune of others. But rather than eliminate the target, Wayne's wife played by Lara Flynn Boyle, Williams warns her of the predicament and that her marriage ought quite clearly be an item of concern form here on in. Once all is said and done, the real hit-man in Dennis Hopper's Lyle shows up in jet black Texan attire and similarly coloured car more resembling a hearse than anything else, whilst developments and complications in exactly who it is the chief of police is in the whole area open up.For Cage's character, and like in most good film noir when dealing with the down-trodden lead whom treads a fine line between right and wrong, the persistent idea of torn morals floats to the surface relatively quickly and consistently in Red Rock West. In just observing the premise, the notion of Williams illegally accepting the offer of being paid to kill someone before refraining from doing it when confronted with the innocent figure of Wayne's wife, Dahl highlights his character's soon-to-be prominent ever shifting; ever changing attitudes to what crime infused activity is playing out around him. Throughout, Williams lies; shoots; kills and steals but additionally saves; offers salvation and actually avoids violence on several occasions when straight forward murder would have offered a simple way out of a predicament. Given this, Dahl expertly manoeuvres Williams from one town in the form of Red Rock to another and then back over the border again, a sort of physical flitting from one place to another in what is a physical manifestation of both the above theories of a film noir's male lead as well as Cage's character's constantly ambiguous hopping from justified in his actions to not as so.Red Rock West moulds a fascinating, and quite terrifying at times, tale out of all these elements; combining a number of items such as double-crosses; multiple identities and intense connections characters have with one another, the sorts that they're forced into forging before later being asked what they truly mean to them. Dahl additionally, and in a very basic sense, taps into a certain idea of post-war disillusionment through his lead in Williams' disconnection from the rest of society seeing him inhabit a desolate and often incomprehensible rural locale in which he just about scrapes by. This, as an old war injury refrains him from making any true advancement in a chosen field of work. Red Rock West is a tight, gripping piece; the sort that arrives with a steady and effective eye on a variety of items all the while under the control of a steady, focused hand.

Walsh giving an tremendous performance as Wayne Brown,thanks to Walsh showing Brown to go gradually more desperate for the killing of his wife to take place,and Walsh also taking full advantage of Dahl's stylish directing,by using the close ups to reveal the darkened lies and dirty deals that lay behind the scar's on Wayne's face.Entering this Neo-Noir like a fire breathing dragon,Dennis Hooper gives a fiery performance as the real Lyle,with Hooper showing Lyle's initially well meaning first appearance to be quickly slashed away and replaced by an outlaw whose only language is increasing the dirty money that is placed in his hands.Kept right at the centre for the whole of the film,Nicolas Cage gives an extremely strong performance,which carefully balances Michael Williams being a down to earth.down on his luck guy,with an increasing,potential deadly desire to get hold of the cash and the woman that are both just out of William's reach,which leads to Red Rock West being a gravel road that is defiantly worth travelling down.

It's well paced, well acted and doesn't leave us with loose ends or unanswered questions so typical in this genre.Nicolas Cage stars as Michael, an unemployed Texas roughneck, desperate enough for a job to drive all the way to Wyoming for potential employment. He is honest to a fault, but always on the dark side of fate.After failing to obtain gainful employment, Michael stumbles into the Red Rock bar where the owner Wayne (J.T.Walsh) mistakes him for a contract killer he summoned from Dallas, hired to do in his lovely but lethal wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle).Wayne gives Michael the necessary details and a down payment for the hit on the adulterous Suzie. With no intent on following through, Michael accepts the money and then sets out to warn Suzanne of her impending demise. He also mails a letter to the local sheriff exposing the plot and splits.As fate would dictate, Michael is not going to be rid of the situation that easy. While leaving in a violent rainstorm, he runs down Suzannes lover. Of course Michael being Michael, he takes him to the local hospital where it's discovered that he's also been shot.The sheriff is summoned and as luck would have it, Wayne is also the local law. Michael manages to escape while being taken on that last ride and is subsequently picked up by the real Lyle from Dallas played with murderous glee by the quirky Dennis Hopper. After discovering that they're fellow marines, Lyle insists that Michael join him for a drink at, where else, the Red Rock bar. There Wayne realizes his mistake and soon he and Lyle are in hot pursuit of Michael who falls willingly into Suzannes waiting arms.As the pace picks up we learn that Wayne and Suzanne are really wanted armed robbers, on the lam for a multi million dollar theft. Getting the money now becomes the films central focus with a series of betrayals, double crosses and murders.The film was very well cast. Nicolas Cage was typically low key, Dennis Hopper and Lara Flynn Bolye assumed their respective roles with more than ample ability. The best performance was by the late J.T. Walsh who was menacing without appearing to be. Walsh was a great character actor who left us much too soon.Marc Reshoskys photography utilized many unique angles which added to the suspense and plot development. The film was further enhanced by John Dahl's tight directorial style and Morris Chestnut's rapid fire editing.

Sandwiched between Kill Me Again and The Last Seduction, Red Rock West was one of three neo noirs directed by Dahl who now finds himself marooned in TV land. It has a cast to die for and Nicholas Cage at the peak of his career. It is fantastic to see that the late J.T. Walsh is given a substantial role as bar owner/sheriff Wayne and shares as much screen time as Cage, Hopper and Boyle.Cage plays an out of work jobless drifter who in desperation pretends to be someone else to secure employment. Unfortunately the job requires him to murder the wife of a small town bar owner. Although he takes the money and runs from the town of Red Rock his own honesty sucks him back into the town into a shed load of trouble. Being in noir territory plot twists and deception abound. Denniis Hopper excels as hit-man Lyle. His acting is a joy to behold - all the usual Hopper mannerisms are present and the razor sharp dialogue flows from his lips in a unique style that no other actor is ever likely to replicate again. A true one off. Having said that the movies sharpest line is given to bit part actor Dwight Yoakam. My only beef is how they made sexy actress Lara Flynn Boyle look so frumpy in her rural cowgirl clothing but her acting is first class as usual.Of course there are the usual plot contrivances only found in movies in order to move the story along - the worst possibly being Cage being rescued by Hopper (the man he happens to be impersonating) just after he escapes the clutches of J.T. Walsh's crooked sheriff.I am always amazed at the blank expressions i receive when i name check this movie to others. Do yourself a favour and rent/buy this movie immediately.

This should be assumed from seeing Red Rock West, though his 'noir' influence comes through in other films as well (Kill Me Again and to a degree Joy Ride). He knows how to write a lone average-Joe type of character, and the shady villain, and a sexy Femme Fatale. He knows this, but he also fills his story of a drifter coming to a small Wyoming town and being (accidentally?) hired to kill a man's wife with some top-shelf talent. Or, at least, the best actors that could make the parts their own.It's a cold little movie where you realize pretty quickly that despite Michael's nice-guy quality, he's still a potential thief and is the comparatively not so bad. Not so bad compared to Wayne the bartender or Sheriff, if that is indeed his name, and his wife who wants to escape to Mexico with all of the money she inherited (please note the quotations). An extra slice of danger comes with the appearance of the actual man hired to kill the woman, Lyle from Dallas played by the late Dennis Hopper. His character and performance is far less aggressive than in Blue Velvet, though this is like comparing a Tasmanian Devil to a bull at a fight.I liked the suspense, of not knowing who might double-cross who next or where the story might go depending on who is alive, and I also liked that they gave each character something to them. Michael and Lyle meet up the first time under unusual circumstances and he gives Michael a ride, where they each find out they were marines, Michael formerly a fighter in a botched mission in Lebanon. This is mentioned about halfway into the film, but it helps to set up this guy as a somewhat tragic figure, without a home and without a job but all of those memories he'd rather not take with him. Certainly not to Mexico, where he has nice ones with his father.Again, the casting and the writing is what makes the film. Lara Flynn Boyle works just about perfect as the female figure of desire and greed, and even if we've seen something like her before she's still fresh because of her performance. JT Walsh is also good but in a different way, where he's a lot more careful with his words, but one can see the look of panic when it surely comes. And Nicolas Cage, at first seemingly a little bored with the part in the opening scenes, really makes it his own as a reluctant hero with nothing to lose. Dialog is used in the film only so much to keep things moving along, but I mean this as a compliment; it's not minimalism, but economy of speech if that makes sense. Dahl knows exactly what he wants in his B-movie premise, and it's like he's taken material sitting on a shelf for years and dusted it and made it vital again.

I saw this film principally because it was directed by John Dahl - a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as The Last Seduction, Rounders and Roadkill. I figured that if this film was up to standard of what I've already seen from the director, it would be well worth watching - and Red Rock West is certainly a film that Dahl can be proud of. The plot focuses on the overly moral Michael; a man travelling across America looking for work. He ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in Red Rock County - only catch is that the job is to murder a man's wife. He's been mistaken for a killer named Lyle, but instead of doing the job; he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway. However, his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real Lyle turns up...John Dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road; he did it three years earlier with Kill Me Again, and again almost a decade on from this film with Roadkill. It's not hard to see why Dahl chooses this sort of location, as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one. Dahl also provides his film with a 'film noir' like atmosphere, as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters. The acting is largely very good, with Nicholas Cage doing an excellent job in the lead role, and getting A-class support from Lara Flynn Boyle, J.T. Walsh and, of course, Dennis Hopper; who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance. It has to be said that the second half of the film isn't as gripping as the first, but Red Rock West certainly is never boring and the way that Dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it. Overall, Red Rock West is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching. It's thrilling throughout, and you can't ask for much more than that!

I was surprised to hear that Red Rock West took nearly two years after its release before it was noticed on a theatrical scale. For any movie lover, this film hits the spot immediately. Cage is a drifter, desperately searching for employment. When a bartender (J.T.

Before he knows what kind of work Walsh wants from him, he agrees without bias. He is just that desperate! Lara Flynn Boyle is the wife he is told to kill, but who herself has a last card (or cards) to play. Dennis Hopper, who is again in the type of role he practically created himself, is the real killer that Walsh hired, one who does not back down until the job is done. Like the best film noir, a truly American form of filmmaking, loopholes and other unexpected turns occur in this latest addition to the series, keeping the viewer pinned to the screen. I didn't have any problem with figuring out what made each character tick, but I did love their chemistry together. All four of them were highly intelligent individuals (a rarity in any American movie), and it was only against each other that they would eventually foul up. Red Rock West reminded me again the reason why I love movies, a necessity in my book to be declared one of the best pictures of the year. Rating Three stars and a half.

Michael is a drifter; Suzanne and Wayne have taken out contracts on each other, and Lyle is a cold-blooded assassin. The story is somber, at times chilling and always suspenseful. Michael gets involved purely on a whim, driven by the need to get some money, fast. That immediately lands him in trouble. It is revealed that Wayne, who is thoroughly detestable not because he is so obnoxious (he is polite and civil) but because he is such a dolt, is an office worker for a large firm who embezzled $1,900,000. To avoid the law and provide himself cover, he becomes the law, getting himself elected sheriff of a small out of the way town, Red Rock. Suzanne, of course, is aware of Wayne's secret, which, of course, sows the seeds of distrust, which then transforms into treachery. Once Lyle enters the scene, the formula for catastrophe can only explode into open violence. Lyle is the catalyst for the violence. He also is charming and detestable, but unlike the other three, is far more despicable. Unlike Suzanne, who is implicated in having murdered someone, and Wayne, who is willing to kill to protect his secret, and Michael who is not vicious, Lyle is a predator. Unsurprisingly, once Lyle, played by Dennis Hopper, enters the story, he subsequently dominates the movie.The only problem with the movie is its ending. It's not a major problem, but maybe it could have been reworked. Michael and Suzanne are on a train leaving town, with the money. Lyle is dead and grumpy Wayne has been shot. Michael and Suzanne have already been intimate and Michael obviously cares about her. The caring feeling, however, is not mutual, and in reaction, Michael tosses Suzanne and the most of the money out of the train. This tests the limits of plausibility. A man, strapped for cash, on a train with a young, sexy woman in possession of a huge amount of cash, and whose life he has saved, throwing both her and the money out? True, she points a gun at him, but he knows it's not loaded, so there is no harm. So why toss her and the money out? They deserve each other, and the presence of $500,000 in cash could smooth over a lot of ruffled feathers.

It is a film made by movie lovers, for movie lovers, with clearly lots of fun and enthusiasm. It is as much a film-noir as it is a western, a thriller or perhaps a black comedy. Set in middle-of-nowhere Wyoming the film starts with the masculine ex-marine Michael Williams (Cage), with his muscle car on the side of the road. He has almost no gas, only some peanuts as food, and little money.He is on his way to apply for a job at an oilfield. Seemingly a friend told him this job would be a definitive. Williams, however, doesn't get hired due to a war injury. Williams hits the road again, searching for a job in another place. He stops at a local gas station, where he wants to fill his tank and ask for advice. The gas station seems abandoned and at the cash register some cash is exposed&#x85; This is one of the first in many moments where William's moral stance is put to the test. Steal the much needed money or leave it alone and stay broke? Luckily, Williams doesn't have to make a choice; the owner unexpectedly appears. Williams asks for gas and a place where he can find a job. You can try Red Rock says the man, while he fills the tank for five dollars &#x96;the last of William's money.Welcome to Red Rock reads a &#x96;somewhat unsettling- metal sign on the side of the road when Williams enters the town. It is a sign that he will encounter many more times, for it seems that leaving Red Rock isn't as easy as entering it. It is here where it all goes downhill He asks for a job in the local bar, which results in a strange twist of fate. The bartender (J.T. Marsh) thinks Williams is the killer he had hired to murder his cheating wife! The pay for it is big and Williams can't resist the temptation; he accepts the offer. Instead of killing the bartender's wife though, he explains her the whole situation, She, however doesn't seem impressed. She actually wants him to do the reverse and kill her husband for double the money! Williams, now full on cash, tries to avoid problems and take a leave from Red Rock, but by bad luck (or fate?), he keeps finding his way back to the diabolical town. When the real killer (a brilliant Dennis Hopper) shows up and the existence of even more money is discovered, Williams' search for money turns into a rat race, where lust, greed, obsession and violence are no exceptions.As you can read, Red Rock West is a dark film. Every character has its own secret agenda and even Williams'' moral is sometimes quite ambiguous. Although the film is quite funny sometimes, with enough irony and black humor, it is still one of the more serious films starring Nicolas Cage. Cage plays his character quite natural and even has few of his famous freak-outs.The atmosphere of this film is just brilliant. The film is well shot, the music is amazing (too bad I couldn't find it anywhere on the internet), the cast is great, the pace is fast and the plot is gripping. It has many great and exciting scenes and the way the thriller and western genres are combined is very entertaining. Still, somehow, the film never really delivers a form of profoundness, which more memorable and canonical films do provide. It is as if something is missing.Nonetheless, I think Red Rock West is an extremely underrated and overslept film. Don't expect a full blown masterpiece here. Rather expect a very good and entertaining thriller/western with a great role for Nicolas Cage.As Roger Ebert fittingly concluded his review of the film In a sense, we've been in Red Rock many times before It's a town where plots lie in wait for unsuspecting visitors, where hatred runs deep, where love is never enough of a motive for doing anything when cash is available.

Apon driving into a little town of red rock he enters the red rock tavern to see about a job and in a serious judgement error ends up taking a job that belonged to a professional hit-man (Dennis Hopper) needless to say all hell breaks loose and the moral of the story is number one money is never easy and number two...watch who's life you try to impersonate as the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Good casting featuring the late great Jt Walsh who was always a pleasure to watch work and a very underrated actor to say the least. Another great and recently passed Dennis Hopper portrays the hit-man that was originally intended for the hit but was a little later then mike at arriving to the bar.

It has been established right from the start that Mr Cage might be down but he is not out,and he might be broke but he will not steal,not even in his present dire circumstances.Consequently when he is mistaken by Mr J.T. Walsh for the man he has commissioned to murder his wife,Mr Cage calls on the wife to warn her of her husband's intentions.In turn she,in the person of Miss L.F.Boyle, offers him even more money to murder Mr Walsh.Mr Cage decides to leave whilst he is still in front but as he is driving out of town he hits a man in the road.Tempted as he might be to drive on,he takes the man to hospital,where it turns out he has been shot.Mr Cage is detained by the Deputies who call the sheriff who turns out to be Mr J.T.Walsh. Events take a further complicated turn when,escaping from custody,Mr.Cage narrowly avoids being run over by the real hit-man on his way to fulfill his commission.About now you might be forgiven for thinking enough already,but as it happens on the screen it seems a completely logical turn of events,the narrative flow of the movie at this point seeming unstoppable. Mr D.Hopper is comfortably cast as the hired killer,like Mr Cage a USMC veteran.This little piece of serendipity keeps Mr Cage alive long enough out-think the murderous trio and survive,a little more battered but still unbowed. It is a tribute to everybody involved that what sounds on paper remarkably like a piece of nonsense is in fact a tense exceptionally well made picture with fine performances all round.

Watching this movie now (in 2005), I can see that it doesn't really fit into the genre of movies that was coming out in the early 90s. I don't really think it can be considered a film noir, but it is pretty dark at times, due mostly to the lighting and odd personalities of the characters.Typical performances from each of the three main actors, who all did a good job with their roles. I thought, however, that Hopper and Boyle's characters were left undeveloped, as it was sometimes hard to understand what they were doing and why they were doing it. Hopper is a love him or hate him kind of guy. The plot is really good, and although I found some parts to be very unrealistic, there were parts where I had to hand it to the director (i.e. when he first sees the sheriff).

WALSH'.'DENNIS HOPPER' plays the character named 'Llye' who is a cold-blooded killer and just focuses on the job he does.This character reminds me the character,'Sentenza' who played by 'LEE VAN CLEEF' in 'THE GOOD,THE BAD,AND THE UGLY' more than the similar character in again played by 'HOPPER' in 'TWIN PEAKS'.And 'LARA FLYNN BOYLE',a femme-fatale character which every crime movie needs.She is also another mystery in this story with puzzles;you don't understand if she really loves 'Michael' the end of the movie.Another classic point from crime movie genre is used in this point,too;less characters with more tension between them.A thing that hits me in this movie is the song playing in the end by 'DWIGHT YOAKAM' who also has a a small role in the movie as a truck driver.'A 1000 MILES AWAY FROM NOWHERE';in the lyrics,the tune,the harmony with the atmosphere of the movie makes an incredible work.'ROGER EBERT' says that Red Rock West is a place we've been in many times.Really there are times we are tempted,out of control,no idea what to do,where nothing seems enough strong against money.In the beginning of the movie we enter the town with Michael by the side of the 'WELCOME TO RED ROCK WEST' signal and the movie ends as we leave the town by watching the train.It's like a period of our lives to stand tall and test our faith.In both cinema language and life language Red Rock West is a town we all have ideas how it seems.

Therefore it goes to show that a project can turn out decent when a director puts his thoughts on screen. The direction is of good standard, however while watching the movie I got a made for TV movie feeling. There were too many close up frames. However this does not deter the movie from being an enjoyable experience. The movie had good pace and the structure was perfect. Dahl written the script with good duration of lenght.Cage portrayed the role as a drifter realistically, though to me his performance seemed somewhat restrained. His facial expressions were on the mark. Lara Flynn Boyle was hot and handled her part perfectly as the femme fatale. Her hairstyle was far out and can make any guy go on his knees. Hopper played his part well. But I feel he was miscast for this role. He did not convince me that he had the qualities of a hit-man.

He roles into Red Rock and is mistaken by bartender Wayne (JT Walsh, not quite as his most menacing-but still evil) for a hit-man from Texas.He pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary. Only when he gets there, just to check her out. She offers him double to kill Wayne. Cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be. But a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo-yoing in and out of Red Rock, back and forth. Eventually this leads to a run-in with Lyle from Dallas (a cheeky and somehow sympathetic Dennis Hopper), the REAL hit-man from Texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated.RRW never had a big release, thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable TV showings. Viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a TV movie but it's bigger than that. The slick, slowly-timed direction, moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the DVD on a big HDTV.The only weak point of the movie I can think of is Lara Flynn Boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke-ish hairdo.

To onlookers, a city like Red Rock would be a quaint checkpoint under the umbrella of a long-winded road trip, perfect for a pit stop and a quick bite to eat. Stay there too long, though, and you'll find yourself desperate for entertainment, money, love, and more. Maybe that's why the characters in Red Rock West are so cold-blooded.When the film was first introduced to audiences during the Toronto Film Festival in 1993, it was immediately well-received, a neo-noir praised for its uncommon quality. Distributors weren't as smitten. When its domestic rights were sold to Columbia Tri-Star, a theatrical release was out of the question. The film doesn't fall neatly into any marketable category. A western film noir isn't something people can immediately spark to, the head of the marketing department of Polygram declared. So it was disregarded, branded as a cable and direct-to-video product. It was shown on HBO seven times in the fall, but the small-screen, after all, is certainly not a distinguished place for a movie to be shown, especially one that should be taken seriously.But just as things could not have gotten any worse, they suddenly became better When Bill Banning, the owner of San Francisco's famous Roxie Cinema, saw Red Rock West for the first time, he disagreed with the distribution it was receiving. Surely, the film had an audience. And after a year of trying to secure the rights, his faith in the film paid off; it became such a box-office smash at the Roxie that it eventually was given a proper limited release, becoming an art-house favorite within a few weeks.Normally, I wouldn't go so deeply into the backstory of a film that came out more than 20 years ago, but as of 2015, Red Rock West still feels like a classic waiting in the wings, desperately wanting to be discovered by another Banning. Even after all the ruckus it made throughout 1993- 1994, it remains a hidden gem, deserving to sit on the same golden throne that Blood Simple currently lounges on.A drifter in the same caliber as John Garfield in The Postman Always Rings Twice, Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) finds himself in the city of Red Rock after failing to acquire a promising oilfield job. When he stops by a local bar to wash away his sorrows, he is confronted by the owner, Wayne Brown (J.T. Walsh), who mistakes him for a hit-man he hired to kill his wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). Michael is young and stupid, so when Wayne offers him an eye-grabbing stack of cash, he fails to correct him that he's actually Michael Williams from the Navy, not Lyle from Dallas.Being the nice guy that he is, he breaks into the Brown home, hoping to warn Suzanne that she's in grave danger. But when the real hit-man (Dennis Hopper) shows up, Michael finds himself tangled in a net of lust and sin that can only end badly. And it surely doesn't help when he becomes romantically involved with Suzanne.In the ashen throes of the film noir genre, there is almost always a recurring feeling of déjà vu; once you've seen a disciple with a drifter, a femme fatale, and a shady husband mixing it up, you've probably seen them all. Film noir has hardly changed since its peak years (the 1940s and '50s), yet it has maintained a startling freshness in the same way comic books have. You may have experienced every storyline possible, but the way those story lines are told, with hard-bitten cynicism and dark alleyway peril, have infinite allure.Red Rock West is a consistent delicacy, a greatest hits album of film noir adventures. Look at the way a cigarette dangles on Lara Flynn Boyle's kissable lips. Look at the way Dennis Hopper handles his gun, like a detective flying off-the-rails of his sanity. John Dahl is a director who knows his movies &#x97; after only a few minutes into the film do you get the sense that Murder, My Sweet and Raw Deal are not just B- movies to him, but cookbooks, its recipes lingering in the cinematography and the writing.Red Rock West isn't without its issues Music plays when a scene should be strictly silent, destroying any tension waiting to be had, and it would have been interesting if the film had explored Michael and Suzanne's relationship as thickly as Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson's. But two minor flaws can hardly deter the success of a film as striking as Red Rock West. Ignoring the disconcerting violence that plagued the majority of '90s independent neo-noirs, the film is deliciously old-fashioned and deliciously stylish.

There's also a delicious undercurrent of humour; whenever Mike tries to do the right thing it invariably leads him into more trouble, and just as soon as he thinks he knows the score he has the rug pulled out from under him again. Cage gives a great weary performance in the lead but the three supporting actors have the plum roles; Hopper is the definitive Texan psycho good-old-boy, complete with Johnny Cash stylings, bolo tie and jet-black Buick V8, Boyle slinks through the picture cheating on everybody she comes into contact with, and Walsh (who sadly died of a heart-attack in 1998, well before his time) is excellent in the pivotal role of Wayne the bartender/sheriff, just the right mixture of ruthless, nervous, mistrustful and squeamish. Watching these characters rub off on each other - especially when all four are stuck together for the graveyard finale - is a misanthropic delight.

The naive Michael thinks it's enough to warn Suzanne and drive away but he got offered a second job by Suzanne this time  100000 dollar if he kills Jim.... 50000 + 100000 = 150000 dollar but Michael forget one thing, two in fact  the real manhunter (Dennis Hopper) shows up and in his own naitivity he wrote the sherrif that a man wanted to kill his wife but the man happens to be the sherrif himself.... You think I told you the whole movie? Well, it's just a start as Red Rock West drives you from one plot to another plot and everything is filmed in a sort of Twin Peaksstyle salted with a violencerate of Tarantino (not that Quentin meant one thing back then). The characters are superb  Dennis Hopper plays a perfect maniac, Lara Flynn Boyle is always the femme fatale people like us can only dream about and Nicholas Cage is just what he is  one of the best actors ever....

He drives into a small Wyoming town, and while in a bar is mistaken by the owner for a Texas hitman. The bar owner Wayne(played well by J.T Walsh) asks Cage to kill his wife Suzanne(Lara Flynn Boyle). Michael agrees, but keeps the money, and accepts Suzanne's offer. Then the fun begins, with Michael stumbling upon the real Texas hitman, Lyle (Dennis Hopper, in a suitably manic performance).The rest of the film is full of twists and action, has Michael and Suzanne elude Wayne and Lyle. An entertaining film, that speeds along. The ending is a bit of a surprise too.

Sometimes this is disastrous and sometimes worthwhile, and realistically he hasn't appeared in a really good movie since Adaptation in 2002.But Cage ruled the 90's, in between the commercial stuff like Con Air, The Rock and Face/Off he continued taking chances with his choices with Wild At Heart and Leaving Las Vegas. Red Rock West was made in between his indie period of the late 80's and the blockbuster guy of the mid to late 90's, it's a pretty good movie but you can see why articles don't say things like Nicolas Cage, of Leaving Las Vegas and Red Rock West fame&#x85;.Strongly reminiscent of some of the Coen brothers early stuff, Red Rock West has more twists and turns than 12 garden variety whodunit thrillers combined. Cage stars as Michael, a man down to his last few dollars that is coming to an end of a long trek to start a new job on an oil drilling site, only due to a military service injury he is knocked back by the boss.So now he is still broke, out of fuel and disenchanted, Michael heads into the nearest town hoping to find work. A couple of early incidents show us he's an honest and ethical guy, the kind of guy that calls a woman Ma'am.Now the next bit can be described, but after the movie is half over the plot becomes impossible to explain simply without major spoilers as reality changes from one minute to the next.So, Michael heads to the local pub and orders a coffee, the barman sees his car parked outside and because of the Texas license plate decides he is the man he is waiting for Lyle from Texas. As the mistaken identity involves paid employment Michael goes along with the mistake, until he finds out that the job is to kill Wayne the barman's wife. Rather than straight out saying No Michael takes the cash and heads to Wayne's home.Somehow Michael happens upon the wife riding a horse to where she is having some hanky-panky with another farmhand, it's never really explained how he knew she would be there but who cares? Michael then goes to the house and waits for her return, when they meet he explains why he is there, and Suzanne (played by 25 kg Lara Flynn-Boyle) calmly counter offers Michael, at double the rate, to kill Wayne instead.Again Michael agrees, only this time he says enough and decides to Lock it in Eddie, taking the cash with the sole intention of buggering off. Now in non-Hollywood this would be the end of it, but because a movie can't be over in 45 minutes we follow Michael as he leaves town in the rain. Here's where the twists get hectic, I'll summarise the next 15 minutes- Michael hits someone in his car and takes them to the local hospital. (He's a nice guy remember?) - The Sheriff turns out to be the last person Michael needs to see, Wayne. - Wayne is a bit miffed at the perceived double cross and decides to off Michael. - Michael escapes, runs off and is picked up by Dennis Hopper, who is, you guessed it Lyle from Texas!I can't explain much more without spoilers and confusion, only from here on in the remainder of the film revolves around Suzanne, Wayne, Michael and Lyle, and includes a myriad of twists and turns, deception, betrayal and double crossing galore. Everything a grown movie needs really.Wayne is played by JT Walsh, usually a bit player in other movies and I have always felt he is a bit over the top.Dennis Hopper is always ultra-hammy, and is almost cartoonish here.Lara Flynn-Boyle is surprisingly low key through most of the film, and has flawless skin regardless of the circumstances.Cage plays the troubled hero part to the hilt, he's the prototype for the nice guy in a situation that he wants to avoid but can't.The finale is in keeping with the rest of the film and is fairly satisfying.If I might digress momentarily, at one stage Michael walks into a bar and says Give me a beer, now I have walked into many bars and know if I ever say that the bartender will say something along the lines of Which one d**khead? Since the dawn of time even the most low key bar stocks more than one brand, in fact most have literally dozens to choose from. Dunno why this bothers me but it does. If you're worried about the perception of product placement do what Tarantino does and make up a brand.Final Rating &#x96; 7 / 10. We twist. And turn. And twist and twist and turn. Twist, twist, twist. Turn, turn, turn. The Itchy and Scratchy Show. I mean Red Rock West.

Can the same be said of neo-noir?","Date":"9 January 2004","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","Review":"  This is the modern west, in all its desolation and deterioration  &#150; a wilderness where the only oases are cinderblock bars tarted up with neon, where there are so few inhabitants that men (and on occasion women) must wear more than one hat.  Into Wyoming, lured by a buddy's promise of a job, comes Nicholas Cage, up from Texas, but loses it because of his bum leg (he was in the bombing of the marine barracks in Lebanon).Ducking into a saloon for a cup of coffee he probably can't even pay for, he's offered a high paying gig by the owner (J. T. Walsh), who seems to know him  Knocking off his cheatin' wife (Lara Flynn Boyle).  No fool, Cage takes the money but, no killer, warns her (and, in an anonymous letter, the sheriff) that her life's in jeopardy.  Driving away, he hits a man; taking him to the hospital, it turns out the man had been shot &#150; and that he was Flynn's trailer-cowboy lover.  Arrested, Cage discovers that the sheriff is the bar owner that hired him.  That's almost the end of him, but rescue comes from an unlikely source &#150; the real Texas hit-man Walsh engaged (Dennis Hopper)....Red Rock West numbers among those latter-day suspense thrillers that are called neo-noir.  Translated, this generally turns out to mean that the plot has a few more twists than usual; it says nothing about look, or outlook, or the other characteristics that make the noir cycle such a distinctive period in cinema history.  And Red Rock West is almost entirely plot (though its spare photography has a unity to it).  Its performances are never less than competent but never much more, either; the characters are outgrowths of the plot, not vice versa.  John Dahl, the director, would do some well-above-average work in his next movie, The Last Seduction.  But that may just have been a fluke.  Judging by later movies such as Joy Ride, his talents slant decidedly toward the commercial &#150; that is, to plot, and then more plot, twisting slowly, slowly in the wind.

Basically drifter Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) is in the town Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for a job, and meeting bar owner Wayne Brown (Pleasantville's J.T. Walsh) he is given a large sum of money, mistaken for a hit-man he has hired to kill his unfaithful wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). He does not correct him, takes the money, and goes to warn Suzanne, and after she makes him a counteroffer, he decides he needs to leave. When Wayne knows his real identity, he chases Michael shooting a big gun, until he gets in a car with Lyle from Dallas (Dennis Hopper). But things get complicated when Michael realises Lyle is the hit-man he was mistaken for, and he makes a quick retreat. He goes back to Suzanne, and knowing they are both in danger, they plan to leave town together, and add another complication by falling for each other. Before they leave however, Suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe. Of course things aren't going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle catch up to them, and Lyle forces them and now tied-up Wayne to go and get the buried money. In the end, Lyle and Wayne both get what they deserve, Michael and Suzanne do get on a moving train together, but it is obvious she cares more about the money, and she gets what she deserves too. Also starring Craig Reay as Jim, Vance Johnson as Mr. Johnson, Timothy Carhart as Deputy Matt Greytack, Dwight Yoakam as Truck Driver and Robert Apel as Howard. The performances, apart from maybe a lame Boyle, are all fine and dandy, and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller. Very good!

It`s at this point I wish to plead to the reader to believe me because this actually happens in the movie , the man Michael ran down is the person Michael is supposed to kill , but being a decent man ( Remember he`s a drifter , not a hitman and he ran the person down by accident ) he drives his victim to hospital where it`s revealed the victim was shot twice in the stomach before getting run down .

Think about it As you can imagine RED ROCK WEST takes some swallowing , too much in my humble opinion , to work as a classic thriller .

It's taut, well acted, and generally well plotted (but see below).  Good performances all around, including the late, great J.T. Walsh.However, I must express my extreme annoyance with a major plot hole.  Near the end of the movie, Dennis Hopper's character agrees to give up his semi-auto pistol, which he places on the ground, removing and pocketing the magazine/clip.  This pistol is then picked up by J.T. Walsh's character. It eventually ends up in the possession of Lara Flynn Boyle's character.  She threatens Nick Cage with the gun, who refuses to be intimidated because he knows the gun is unloaded.  The problem is that the gun cannot be unloaded.  We saw it fired once, earlier, before Hopper relinquishes it, which meant that there had to be a round in the chamber at the time Hopper put the gun on the ground.  Removing the magazine alone doesn't render a gun unloaded.  The round in the chamber has to be ejected to do that, and this was never done in the movie.  (NOTE the Al Pacino movie, SCENT OF A WOMAN gets this right.  At the end of the scene where he has been talked out of suicide, he ejects the round from the chamber of his .45 semi-auto from which he had earlier removed the clip.)Nick Cage is supposed to be viewed as being clever by remembering that the gun is unloaded, but in the real (as opposed to Hollywood world), he'd be dead, killed by the last round in the gun.Rating 7 - 2 (for the awful plot hole) = 5  "}]
