[{"Title":"Probably only a non-American could make this movie","Date":"2 April 2004","Score":"88 out of 100 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":"  I've watched this movie twice now on DVD, and both times it didn't fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude. It seems more like a depiction of reality than most other Hollywood fare, especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed. Even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint, it doesn't fail to question it, and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost, not matter what, and cruelty is a common denominator.What really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to over-dramatize. Nowadays truly good movies (in a nutshell) are few and far apart, with mainstream fare being enjoyable (if you don't have high expectations), but terribly commercially spirited. I think this movie comes off as a truly good movie (without being a masterpiece), because it sticks to itself, and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it, instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence. This movie is cool, observant, and generally light-handed in its judgement, which is GOOD.The story has its flaws, especially Jewel's Character comes off doubtfully, but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic, that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life, even by liberally taking each next guy. Still she doesn't come off as weak, in fact I think she's one of the stronger characters, she's always in control of the relationships, with the men just tagging. And I take it very gratefully that she's not a weeping widow. I believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now. You could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries, so the prospect of of someone dying, while surely causing grief, didn't traumatise people like it does now. People didn't seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now, and I like that attitude.My recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie, if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare. Don't watch if if you want non-stop action or heart-renting emotion.

The border states in this war were completely divided and often the inhabitants of these states were caught up in desperate struggles for their lives and homes.Certainly Ride with the Devil does not feature the epic battle scenes that Gettysburg brought to the screen, but it does give an excellent insight as to how everyday people dealt with the total destruction of their lives.Ride with the Devil certainly gives a fresh and unique perspective of the Civil War.  It is to the movies credit that it fully explores the tedium of life experienced by the common combatant who faced moments of tremendous anxiety while in combat and the long dull periods of no action.Furthermore, I am really tired of movie critics harping on the dialects and language used in the movie.  Well folks I hate to tell you, but in the 19th Century people generally spoke in the manner that this film depicts.  I believe that the language in the film is one of its finest points.Ang Lee went to great pains in making this one of the finest period pieces that I have encountered.  Mr. Lee used hundreds of Civil War re-enactors and took great care in making sure that his principle actors, sets, and scenery looked the part. The movie was filmed in Missouri and Kansas and captures the scenic beauty of this area.The actors are of a fine calibre and should be recognized for their outstanding performances.  Considerable kudos should go to Tobey Maguire and Geoffrey Wright.  They both were believable in their mannerisms and dialect. Tobey Maguire is outstanding in his use of period language.All in all the movie is great.  Since it wasn't on the big screen long we can only hope that the video will arrive soon.  Sometimes it is refreshing to go and see a movie that is about real people and events that really happened.

Daugherty was a very young teenager during the civil war in Missouri. While still twelve he was put to work as a mule-skinner by one of the black-flag bands of bushwackers around Cedar County, in southern Missouri. He later mastered the use of the six-shooter, and rode with Quantrill. He claimed to have ridden with Jesse and Frank James during and after the war, but every man of his generation made the same claim. Were all the claims true, it would probably be about fifty thousand in all who rode with the James boys.J.W. claimed not to have been present during the burning of Lawrence, but so did everybody else. With so many thousand occupied in riding with the brothers James, it is passing strange that so few managed to be present during the actual burning of Lawrence, the single most important action of the Quantrill band.I am, incidentally, named after Lawrence, that appellation being my first name.J.W. claimed it was the James brothers who invented the idea of gripping the reins in their teeth while firing both revolvers, thereby availing oneself of a full twelve rounds in flight. J.W. ended up being the champion fiddler of Missouri, losing that title only when jealous rivals shut him out of the fiddling contests because he could read music.Another great-grandfather of mine was James Quinn, a young captain of the Union calvery. This was a Missouri militia unit, but militias on the border often saw more action that regular units back east. His job was to guard the railroads from the highway agents who even then were perfecting the feat of robbing the trains of yankee gold sent south for payroll.James and J.W. were supposed to have been on opposite sides during the Battle of Wilson's Creek, but it is impossible to know for sure. I have copies of Union orders for Captain James Quinn, having to do with the bandits operating in southern Missouri.This film, RIDE WITH THE DEVIL, is one of the truly great American films, and the only one that even begins to get close to the feeling of the border wars, the bushwacking, the betrayals, and the split families. In Missouri, the Civil War was hell on earth, breaking every family apart at least once.Toby McGuire is overwhelming in his grasp of the teenage border warrior who has known nothing else but killing, and who finally decides to make a new life in California. Jewel is astonishing as the young survivor widowed twice, but full of life and a desire to live it to the fullest.The historical details are almost always spot on, and the faces of the men and women are disturbingly like what they must have been in those terrible days.But finally, it is the script that is almost unbelievable in its power. Even when one or two words are wrong, the scriptwriter manages to somehow capture the mood and the rhythms of 19th-century speech in that part of the country, in all its humor and deep fatalism and courtesy--and yes, its cruelty too.This is the first work of art that made me feel something close to what my great-grandfathers must have gone through. They left many stories and written records behind, but such autobiographies conceal as much as they reveal, especially about the violence and its traumatizing effects of the young males who experienced it.I am grateful to the makers of this film, the script-writer, the author of the original book WOE TO LIVE ON, the actors and others who created RIDE WITH THE DEVIL and somehow managed to make it such a stunning work of art. To them I am thankful for bringing me closer to ancestors who made me what I am; and who--for better or worse--made this country what it is.Lawrence Swaim  "},{"Title":"There are no heros ... just great film makers","Date":"2 April 2001","Score":"63 out of 65 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":"  Easily 9 out of 10 for a film by director we will continue to grow to admire. But don't watch this movie expecting to be entertained. Ang Lee takes an objective look at a relatively unexplored aspect of the Civil War. What is beautiful about the movie, like all of Lee's films, is that he doesn't side with his characters. He creates characters, embodies them with life, problems, and ambiguity ... and endows them with a reality that often hits far closer to home than with which many are comfortable. This film has action, but it is not for the action lover since the violence is deeply disturbing and far from gratuitous ... i.e. like the characters, it is real. And as you would expect about one of mankind's most horrific wars, the violence is horrific.But as an exploration of the greater human ambiguity that surely dwelt within the Civil War, it is a masterpiece. Was the war about slavery and an abolitionism? Lee seems quite willing to blur that line made so popular in depictions like the Blue and the Grey. Neither is about idealism, though, as seen in Gone with the Wind. It is about freedom, about the desire to have something which is yours and to fight for it. As you watch the characters, you will ask yourself how can they be fighting to preserve slavery? The fact is, I don't think they really are, and in that the film shows the problem of why so many were caught up in the maelstrom of the Civil War.The fact seems clear that many of the characters we learn about are fighting out of senses of loyalty to home though they may never have examined what home represents or whether they truly espouse its values. The letter scenes are very moving and yet subtle. Jake and Daniel are other examples of loyalty stretched to the limits. And when the tension finally snaps, and these characters find themselves suddenly free ... we see the birth of new men.All this mixed in with Lee's beautiful incorporation of humankind's environment with breathtaking vistas and frames. Lee has a style which is his, somehow European in its art (a slow camera, unrushed), Asian in its epic-ness and development of story, and yet somehow familiar and easily accessible to so many in North Americans.Relax, let go of your preconceptions about what the Civil War is, what the western as a genre is, what a war movie should be ... and let Ang Lee take you into a world so fragile, so hard, so real that few of us can comfortably see it.In this, Lee continues what he wrought in Ice Storm. Again, the movie is slow paced and without apparent direction ... a sure sign of Lee's ability to direct without imposing himself on the story or screen. His direction is amplified by what he brings out of Jewel (yes, the singer), a hitherto unproven actress who puts in an amazing performance.A movie for those who love film and are not lovers of the standard Hollywood epic.

A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch.  Luckily though, I had a good feeling about this director. This movie was wonderfully written.  The dialogue is in the old southern style, yet doesn't sound cornily out of place and outdated.  The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie.  Toby Maguire was awesome.  I thought he was good (but nothing special) in Pleasantville, but here he shines.  I have always thought of Skeet Ulrich as a good actor (but nothing special), but here he is excellent as well.  The big shocker for me was Jewel.  She was amazingly good.  Jeffrey Wright, who I had never heard of before, is also excellent in this movie. It seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand.  A movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa. This movie had the perfect combination.  The actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular.  This movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others.  It lets you really get to know the characters, which are all very dynamic and interesting. The plot is complex, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing, and ready for anything at any time.  Literally dozens of times I was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were too quiet (brilliant directing).  This was also a beautifully shot movie.  The scenery was not breath taking (It's in Missouri and Kansas for goodness sakez) but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings. Has that rough and rugged feel, but keeps an elegance, which is very pleasant on the eyes. The movie was deep.  It told a story and in doing so made you think. It had layers underneath that exterior civil war story.  Specifically, it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for. There were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie, too many to pick out.  It was like a beautifully written short story, filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done. If you like great acting, writing, lots of action, and some of the best directing ever, see this movie!  Take a chance on it.

Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, it follows the exploits of a group of Southern guerrillas, known as bushwhackers, as they fight their Northern equivalents, the jayhawkers in the backwater of Missouri.As one might expect, there is plenty of visceral action, but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it - many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family. Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) is such a man, or rather, boy, as he is only seventeen when the war reaches Missouri. He is the son of a German immigrant, but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a Unionist, he joins his lifelong friend Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and rides with the bushwhackers. Despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed Union men, he remains loyal to the cause. So does his friend Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the South.Lee handles the subject with aplomb, never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war - long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting. The action is unglamorised and admirably candid, recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities.The performances are superb, with Maguire and Wright both courageous and dignified. Up-and-coming Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers is particularly chilling as a cold-blooded killer, while Skeet Ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant. Lee never flinches from the reality of war, but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it - the growth of friendship, the demonstration of courage and, on a wider scale, the emancipation of oppressed peoples. Ride With the Devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that  regularly shocks but always moves the audience.

It stars Tobey Maguire, Skeet Ulrich, Jeffrey Wright, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Simon Baker, James Caviezel and Jewel. Music is by Mychael Danna and cinematography by Frederick Elmes.On the Western Frontier of Missouri, the American Civil War was fought not by armies, but by neighbours. Informal gangs of local Southern Bushwhackers fought a bloody and desperate Guerrilla war against the occupying Union Army and pro-Union Jayhawkers. Allegiance to either side was dangerous. But it was more dangerous still to find oneself caught in the middleMade for $38 million and intended to be a sweeping epic for the summer blockbuster crowd, Ride with the Devil was a considerable financial flop. With a limited release both in America and abroad, the financial figures are hardly surprising. More so considering it was given next to no promotion by the distributors. Factor in a little controversy about the events featured in the story, some cuts made by the studio (Lee didn't have final cut) and a delay in home release formats because the distributor incredibly wanted Jeffrey Wright's presence removed from the cover art! Well you would be forgiven for thinking that the film has to be something of a stinker. Not so say I.Part rites of passage drama, part reflective war movie, Ang Lee's film is a grand film viewing experience. Dealing as it does with the often forgotten part of the war down on the Missouri/Kansas border, where Lee also shoots on location, film manages to be both savage and lyrical in equal measure. The savagery comes with the fights, bloody, frenetic and high on potency, while the lyricism comes with the human relationships, internal conflicts and the political awareness of the men (boys) fighting for their cause. All given deft treatment by Schamus, whose screenplay contains crisp period dialogue and a narrative correctly showing that this part of the war was not just driven by racist Dixie's hell bent on revenge, violent lust and political allegiance, but often for family, land and rights. Picture is at pains to let us know the youth of the main characters, ramming home the point of boys forced to become men, killing machines, very quickly. Case in point, the culmination of the violence in the film that comes by way of the Lawrence Massacre, a tragic and upsetting slaughter that saw 180 people murdered under the leadership of a vengeful William Quantrill (John Ales). Lee and Schamus aren't interested in showing heroism in this particular war, they show it as futile, nasty and it leaves the taste of bile in the throat.From here the film slows considerably, as the lead characters withdraw from the action of war, to awakenings and friendships forming. It's here where Lee is at his best. No great director of action, as evidenced by the previously mentioned Lawrence Massacre; which lacks the cutting edge to really grab us by the throat and never let go, but for human interest aspects and bucolic scenes with characters framed within, Lee owes film fans absolutely nothing. The latter of which he is aided considerably by Elmes' widescreen photography. Ulrich and pop star Jewel nicely handle their parts, he puts a confident swagger into Jack Bull Chiles, she is tender and unassuming in the pivotal female role of Sue Lee Shelley. Caviezel gives Black John Ambrose a brooding menace, while Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is on overdrive as sadistic loony Pitt Mackeson. But it's with Maguire and Wright that the acting plaudits go. Maguire has arguably never been better, he gives Jake Roedel an effective sensitivity as a virginal boy receives a violent initiation into manhood. Wright is sublime, said to be one of his favourite performances, Wright as freed slave Daniel Holt is the heart beat of the film. Conveying most of the good traits available to man, Holt fights not just out of loyalty to his friend George Clyde (Baker), but to gain ultimate catharsis in is life. It's a beautiful measured turn from Wright, and it deserves more appreciative attention. The last third of it may be too talky for some, and a couple of dangling narrative threads left unanswered stop it from being a masterpiece. But it's close to being just that, a savage, beautiful and lyrical movie. The stupid studio execs had no idea Putz's. 9/10 "},{"Title":"One of my favorite westerns","Date":"31 January 2004","Score":"9 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":"  POSSIBLE SPOILERSSkeet Ulrich is great in this Civil War drama, and got top billing. But this is really Tobey Maguire's movie. He is magnificent in this film. This is my favorite TM movie, and my favorite TM performance.Ang Lee is also one of my favorite directors, thanx to this film. I loved THE ICE STORM and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, but this film is the best of the three. Many people say this is historically inacurate, but I've done some research and I don't see more than one or two minor little flawed details. Anyway, I don't know what historical period piece HASN'T been criticized and called inaccurate.Ulrich and Maguire lead a great cast that includes Jewel Kilcher, James Caviezel, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Tom Wilkinson, and the outstanding Jeffrey Wright as the semi slave who befriends Maguire's character.The story centers on the moral tug of war going on inside a young Missouri man named Jake Roedell (Maguire) who, being of German decent, is looked on with scorn and suspicion by Confederate people he lives with, even though he is Confederate thinking. His father is Unionist, and after Roedell joins an army of bushwackers, going on vengeful killing sprees far from home, his father stops talking to him. His friend Jack Bull Childs (Ulrich) protects him whenever their peers start harrassing Jake about being German. The one who does the worst harrassing is Pitt Mackeson (a very campy but fierce performance by Rhys-Meyers).There is a lot of violence and some shocking moments, including but not limited to the loss of a finger, being shot thru the face (oh!!!), the death of a father, and the long, painful death of one of the main cast members. But amid all the violence there remains a poetic, graceful humanity. Someone describes the scenes of the Missouri and Kansas woods as pastoral. I agree completely. It's weird to see bloody battles occuring in lovely green meadows rather than in concrete settings.Whatever critics don't like this film, it remains to me one of the best new westerns ever made, in the ranks of Tombstone and Dances With Wolves.

And, as in any story about any war, beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving.  It is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective, which is what director Ang Lee provides in `Ride With the Devil,' a Civil War drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the War itself, and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the War, the infamous raid on Lawrence, Kansas, by Quantrill and his raiders, which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the Confederate point-of-view.In 1863, the Union influence predominates in the State of Kansas, and even across the border in neighboring Missouri, those with Confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching Northerners, especially without the aid of what could be considered any `regular' Confederate troops.  And when things begin to really heat up around their own town, Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) form a band of their own and join in the fray, doing damage to the Union cause wherever it is practicable.  Jack Bull and Jake do not like the War and do not like killing; but they are standing up for what they believe to be right.  There are others, however, even among their own, men like the young Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality, perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims.  And so, for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many just like them, it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested; a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood.  And they will have to ride with the very Devil himself, against seemingly insurmountable odds.As with all of his films, director Ang Lee approaches his story through an incisive, yet subtle examination of the traditions, cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting.  And in so doing, Lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers, perhaps, a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged.  Whether it's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters (`Eat Drink Man Woman'), the effects of class distinction (`Sense and Sensibility'), the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies (`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above (`The Ice Storm'), Lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level.  This film is no exception; and (as he does with all his films), Lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography (in this film, by Frederick Elmes, who also did `The Ice Storm' brilliantly), which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry.  It's that special Lee touch, and it adds a wistful, reflective sense to whatever story he is telling, which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable.As Jake, Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops, and his character along with it.  Most importantly, Maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him, which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation  His stoic acceptance of death and the news of those `murdered' in the various skirmishes and battles; the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere, even in such troubled times; the betrayal, which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly.  It is all of this that Maguire achieves through his performance, and it is no small accomplishment.  It is, however, the kind of studied, understated performance that is often taken for granted, which is unfortunate; work like this is worthy of acclaim, and should be recognized.Skeet Ulrich is effective, as well, as Jack Bull, and Jewel (in her motion picture debut) turns in an engaging performance as Sue Lee Shelley.  It is Jeffrey Wright, however, who stands out in a notable supporting role as Daniel Holt, as well as Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who brings a chilling Christopher Walken-like menace to his role of Pitt.  Also, in what amounts to a cameo role (one scene), Mark Ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time.The supporting cast includes James Caviezel (Black John), Simon Baker (George Clyde), Tom Guiry (Riley), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Ales (Quantrill), John Judd (Otto Roedel) and Kathleen Warfel (Mrs. Chiles).  The Civil War will forever be an open wound upon the nation; but hopefully, as time goes on, it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films like `Ride With the Devil' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing.  In light of more recent events, it is something that is sorely needed, worldwide.  Film is a powerful medium; it can be educational as well as entertaining, and perhaps in the future more filmmakers, like Ang Lee, will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are.  8/10.

While tackling a dark, gritty subject, the brutal guerrilla war in the American West during its Civil War (which in turned spawned the outlaws of the old west of the 1870s), the movie maintains a strangely satisfying, unmanipulated atmosphere.  What I'm refering to is the tendency of films' music and lighting to make you feel the mood you'd expect to feel.  But RWTD instead has a relatively upbeat soundtrack, and lets the words and action do the talking set the mood rather than manipulation of the viewer's senses.As an enthusast of this particular area of CW history, I'm greatly impressed with the accuracy of the film.  The diologue is expertly written, (even with subtle humor occasionally) with references to bushwhackers and previous boarder battles (Independence for example...A far cry from the Oregon Trail!).  The minor events that occur to Jake's band are similar to actual events that took place...Especially the attack when they're holed up in the house, and the destruction of the store/booth.  The battle scenes, though rare, are pretty well executed.  It even has the first CW cavalry battle put on film recently.The directing shows the talent everyone expects of Ang Lee in subtle ways. Example  The character of Black John is shown taunting a Lawrence resident during the massacre Where's your army? Who are we to fight!? Who are we to fight?!

Little touches like that really enhance the movie's quality.There are no major glaring areas in the history, something that can not be said of the masterpiece of film Glory, which was basically fiction within the context of the major events it follows.  Some minor problems include the fact that the years as shown by the events represented don't add up.  But you will never notice that. A larger curiosity is the fact that the only African-American man-at-arms character in the film is the quasi-slave fighting for Jake and his Confederate bushwhackers. It is true that some blacks did fight for the Confederacy out there, including one who scouted Lawrence for Quantrill before the attack (Who would suspect him?).  Though this black rebel is a fasinating character (whatever PC African-Americans might think of him), not a single black Union infantryman is seen in the film, which would have been more represenative of the black experience in the Western CW.  One of the first black regiments of the CW was raised in Kansas (by the murderer Senator Jim Lane, and before the 54th Mass. Reg. of fame was organized), and black troops in such battles as Baxter Springs, KS, played a critical role.No glaring historical errors.  Good, realistic action, which is infrequent and not gratitous.  Good Directing.  This film may not be the blockbusters other recent Civil War were, but it's the cleanest job of any.

It is dismaying how many films just do not get this right, and it ruins everything. If you want to see a film about the Civil War and feel like you've had a glimpse into history, watch Ride With The Devil. THIS is how people acted, and talked. There is a plethora of films about 19th century America in which the script and the dialogue is of the usual ridiculously anachronistic variety (that is, people did not say things like Okay, that sounds like a plan! in 1950-- let alone 1850!). Verisimilitude is the 10 dollar word for it, and it does wonders for the enjoyment of a movie. I might add that another movie that comes to mind that has a similar you are there accuracy to the script and dialogue is that masterpiece by Martin Scorsese Gangs of New York. Ride With the Devil is worthwhile also because it DOES NOT follow the usual and hackneyed rules of movie story-telling. If you just want to enjoy the usual predictable anecdote, don't see this film. If you like a little truthfulness and true-to-life unpredictability, Ride With the Devil will convince you. It figures it takes an intelligent foreigner to make a really decent movie about the Civil War. Having said that, there yet remains to be made THE classic Civil War film.

I will not rehash what has already been said about this wonderous film, but I would like to say how much the historical research and painstaking attention to detail the crew no doubt went through was appreciated by this filmgoer.As a student of history familiar with the period and setting of this film, I must say that this production is one of the most accurate fictional films regarding bleeding Kansas. Yes there were liberties taken on the actual events, as all fiction is apt to do. But the overall feel of the film is genuine. Authentic costumes, authentic attitudes (no PC hindsight here) even the actors look authentic.Even  Jewel Kilcher (who has a small part in the film) looked like she stepped form a mid 19th century photograph.A few viewers I talked with have expressed their incredulity at the stylized dialog. They cannot believe that 19th century farmers would talk like poets.What they don't realize is that in this age of verbal slobbishness, the American public public of the 19th century was a surprisingly literate and eloquent bunch. These people were raised on Shakespeare and the King James version of the Bible. The screenwriters reconstructed the most likely verbal styles of these people, judging from documentation of the time. The stylized dialog just adds to the magical atmosphere of the film.But in addition to a historical document, this film works on a visceral level as well. Beautifully photographed and performed, it harkens back to the days of the great western epics. The raid on Lawrence, Kansas, done so many times before in so many other, lesser films is portrayed with a sense of urgency that puts the viewer right in the midst of the action.Romance, adventure, moral and ethical conflict.This film has everything a discerning moviegoer could want. In a year that was dominated by overhyped garbage like American Beauty, this great artwork was buried by an indifferent studio system. But I am certain that Ride With The Devil will be given it's due in the coming years. Please rent this film. You will not be disappointed.

Well, I finally received an advance copy of the film on video and it was definitely worth the wait, but I am devestated that I will probably never see this on the large screen.  This film did not receive the marketing it deserves, and I've heard nothing on it's upcoming video release...it's a shame, really.The film follows two young boys who are swept into the battles of the Bushwhackers in 1861 in Missouri.  It is not meant to be an historically accurate account of the Civil War, it is a character study of the boys who fought these battles.  The film accomplishes this beautifully, as the veiwer is swept up in the danger and drama these young men endured.The main character of Jake Dutchy Roedel is portrayed perfectly by Tobey Maguire, which did not surprise me in the least.  He is one young actor today who is truly talented, and I believe he is just beginning to scratch the surface of that talent.  I can't wait to see what he does next, and someday, as he accepts his first Academy Award, I will be jumping up and down in my living room cheering for him.  He puts his heart and soul into the charcters he portrays (see  Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules, Wonder Boys) yet never manipulates his veiwers.  He doesn't shove the emotions of his characters into your face, he pulls you in with them, to the point that you become attatched and marked by these characters emotionally.  He has left traces of Homer Wells, James Leer and Jake Roedel on my heart forever....if that's not good acting, I don't know what you call it.Jewel, Skeet Ulrich and Jeffery Wright are superb in their roles as well, this film was so perfectly cast.  All the talk of Jewel the singer trying to act.....she did very well here, and the scenes with her and Tobey are funny, warm and touching. They have endured tragedy together, and she portrays the all-knowing young widow to his innocent-boy war veteran.  Jake Roedel has killed 15 men so he hasn't had time yet in his young life to bed a woman! Their scenes are the heart of the humor in this film, and there is a believable warmth between them.The battle scenes are well-done, special effects so realistic that you want to turn away from the grusomeness of them, especially the guy who gets shot in the mouth....UGH!  If you're looking for gore, there is some!  All in all, it's a must-see.  It's on video July 18th.  Run to Blockbuster and rent it!!

It deals with Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull (Skeet Ulrich) , two friends living in Missouri when the Civil War bursts out . Jack Bull's dad is murdered by Jayhawkers , so the young men join the Bushwhackers to fight Union soldiers . Bushwhackers are irregulars loyal to the South led by Black John (Jim Caviezel) and the violent Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) , besides George Clyde (Simon Baker). One of them is an African-American , Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), beholden to the man who bought his freedom . They are a little-known band of Civil War fighters known as Bushwhackers . They skirmish then spend long hours hiding. Sue Lee (Jewel), a young widow , brings them supplies . She and Jack Bull become lovers and when he's grievously wounded , Jake escorts her south to a safe farm . Later on , there takes place the looting and burning of Lawrence , Kansas , actually occurred on 21 August 1863 also known as Quantrill's Raid . As his friends die one after another, Jake must decide where honor lies .Exciting film based on historical events set during American Civil War (1861-1865) in which the Bushwhackers use guerrilla warfare to destroy Yankee targets and led by men set on revenge, make a raid into Kansas. The picture efficiently describes the atmosphere of violence in which Women and Blacks have few rights, confrontation among bands and bloody battles . Emotive and evocative musical score by Mychael Danna . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Frederick Elmes. Very good production design , including breathtaking attacks and battles ; the scenes of the Quantrill's Raid on Lawrence, Kansas were filmed in Pattonsburg, Missouri , Pattonsburg was flooded out during the great flood of 1993 and the town was relocated leaving many empty buildings and homes available . The motion picture was well directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback mountain , Sense and Sensibility , Hulk , Crouching tiger , hidden dragon). The flick based on real deeds , these are the followings  The Lawrence Massacre, was a rebel guerrilla attack during the U.S. Civil War by Quantrill's Raiders, led by William Clarke Quantrill, on the pro-Union town of Lawrence, Kansas. The attack on August 21, 1863, targeted Lawrence due to the town's long support of abolition and its reputation as a center for Jayhawkers and Redlegs, which were free-state militia and vigilante groups known for attacking and destroying farms and plantations in Missouri's pro-slavery western counties .By 1863, Kansas had long been the center of strife and warfare over the admission of slave versus free states. In the summer of 1856, the first sacking of Lawrence sparked a guerrilla war in Kansas that lasted for months. John Brown might be the best known participant, but numerous groups fought for each side in Bleeding Kansas.By the beginning of the American Civil War, Lawrence, Kansas, was already a target for pro-slavery ire, having been seen as the anti-slavery stronghold in the state and more importantly, a staging area for Union and Jayhawker incursions into Missouri. Initially the town and surrounding area were extremely vigilant and reacted strongly to any rumors that enemy forces might be advancing on the town. However by the summer of 1863, as none of the threats had materialized, citizen fears had declined and defense preparations were relaxed.Quantrill himself said his motivation for the attack was, To plunder, and destroy the town in retaliation for Osceola. That was a reference to the Union's attack on Osceola, Missouri in September 1861, led by Senator James H. Lane.The attack was the product of careful planning. Quantrill had been able to gain the confidence of many of the leaders of independent Bushwhacker groups, and chose the day and time of the attack well in advance. The different groups of Missouri riders approached Lawrence from the east in several independent columns, and converged with well-timed precision in the final miles before Lawrence during the pre-dawn hours of the chosen day. Many of the men had been riding for over 24 hours to make the rendezvous and had lashed themselves to their saddles to keep riding if they fell asleep. Almost all were armed with multiple six-shot revolvers.Lawrence in ruins as illustrated in Harper's WeeklyBetween three and four hundred riders arrived at the summit of Mount Oread, then descended on Lawrence in a fury. Over four hours, the raiders pillaged and set fire to the town and killed most of its male population. Quantrill's men burned to the ground a quarter of the buildings in Lawrence, including all but two businesses. They looted most of the banks and stores and killed between 185 and 200 men and boys .

I agree with one who said, A fresh and unique perspective. Hat etiquette; the approach of a woman, the mention of death, many topics cause the hats to come off. Certainly a woman entering a room was the basis of a remarkable display of respect with the removal of all male headgear. A notable subtle aspect such as the touching of one's hat brim in front of the brow with the right hand as a display of respect and compliment. This was a commonly performed function.The language is prominently gracious, elegant and superior. It demonstrated a period of times with exceeding consideration. Such language, its dialects and delivery still exist today in a few areas, even here in Kansas but more so in Southern areas still reverent to the real issues of the Civil War. Some of this is mentioned in other reviews.The funniest moment in the film is the discussion where Holt is offered Turner's bacon. His reply was, I could eat more. When Jake Roedel received the same offer from George Clyde, he was told, Well, I'll ---- it out by the oak tree tomorrow and you can help yourself.There is historical accuracy about the founding, and the reason for Lawrence is sound. Topographically it is less than 15 miles from the slave Capitol of Kansas which existed in Lecompton. Proximity to the issues was an everyday point suffered by both sides as it was dangerous to be known as showing allegiance to either side.This dangerous discord in Kansas spilled over into the issue of its coming into the Union on one side or the other. Skirmishes such as portrayed in the film are totally accurate in what was called Bloody Kansas. Its motto even speaks of these times and its joining the Union Ad Astra per Astra, or To the Stars, Through Difficulty.Jewel's speaking voice has a bell-like quality which leaves a resounding impression, even after the end of her speaking. She is an example of exceptional acting which must certainly derive, aside from acting training, to her many years performing on stage. Every scene she appears in leaves this writer spellbound. I regard her best work in the extended scenes at the end of the film, after she and Jake Roedel are married. The exchanges with Pitt Mackeson between Jake and her switch rapidly from confrontation and memory of past events and pronouncements to a more civil conversation, almost forgiving in which Jewel's acting skill carries much of the heightened anticipation of the next series of exchanges, what they may be and what their content will promote.Others have spoken remarkably accurate about the portrayals by other actors.I don't know of another film which addresses this period and location.

The research that went into this production was precise, down to the creation of Lawrence, KS, using the little abandoned town of Pattonsberg, MO as the basic pattern, and dressing it from there. Signage and storefronts were reproduced from photographs of the period, and the town was spot on, including the dirt streets - dirt was hauled in to cover the original macadam to a depth of a foot, in order to prevent serious injury to horses and riders, as well as to maintain accuracy.Language - anyone who has studied language of this period knows how accurate this production was. People spoke in what would be considered stilted today, only because we have become slaves to slang. Read text of the period to verify this.Events - read the history of the timetable of events. RWTD went blow-for-blow with history to repeat the story, from the gathering of bushwhackers to their demise. It's not pretty, but war seldom is.Characters - again, there were thousands of each type of character throughout the area. History research is your friend. The little drama of Jewell - well, those things still happen.The Stuff - all wardrobe, hair, weapons, tack, tactics,etc., were reviewed daily by Any Lee and his assistants. Ang Lee is a bear for accuracy. Believe it.As far as the political ramifications, and why the film did not fare well initially, a few thoughts. It has been said that the NAACP was unhappy with the portrayal of a black man seen as a fighter for the confederacy, and was ready to protest that issue in the press. This may or may not be hearsay, but I heard it from people in production before and after the film was released, so take that as you will.I worked on the production from almost start to finish in Misouri and Kansas. It was the most historically accurate production I've ever worked on, and I am pleased to have been a part of it.

As I watched it, I was amazed at the simultaneous subtlety and depth of the film! The movie tells the story of the guerrilla warfare that took place between Border Ruffians in the frontier between Missouri and Kansas during the Civil War. Missouri was a border state that did not secede, but was politically dominated by pro-slavery forces. Kansas, on the other hand, was a hotbed of Unionist, anti-slavery forces. And if you think the politics of today are ugly, you should research the brutality of the bushwackers and jayhawkers. Imagine anti-abortion and pro-abortion people shooting, stabbing and scalping each other rather than just yelling at each other.Anyway, this is an excellent film. And I am not being politically correct when I am forced to point out that Jeffrey Wright's spot-on performance as Daniel Holt, a slave caught somewhere between freedom, slavery and war was the best in the film. And, yes, that is exactly how some black men ended up fighting for the south.Another surprise Jewel Kilcher can ACT!

True, the storyline may have trouble holding the average Joe's attention.  But, as any history major or Civil War buff can tell you, director Ang Lee did his homework when he made Ride With the Devil.If you're looking for a pseudo-historical drama full of modern verbal anachronisms, impossible non-stop action sequences, and numerous clearly unresearched historical contexts, rent Shanghai Knights.  The language in Ride With the Devil reflects most accurately how the people of the time spoke, according to the letters and written narratives we have from that period.  True, the actors in the film may speak slowly and repeat themselves often, but this is true not only of the time but also of Southern dialects of today.  The floweriness of the language reflects the way the people of Jake and Jack's class thought, to the best of our knowledge.The manner in which the cause of Southern liberty was portrayed in the film is also a very non-partisan, as well as accurate, way of putting history into film.  Most southerners owned no slaves, and cared less whether slavery continued forever or ended within minutes.  Thus the New Englander's view of slavery as the sole cause of the war is highly inaccurate from a southern standpoint.  Ride With the Devil portrays the war in the West for what it was--neighbor taking up arms against neighbor simply because an army had invaded their home and caused the inhabitants to take sides.  The scene where Jake and Jack are eating with their host family in the winter holds some of the greatest Civil War movie dialogue I have ever heard.  The host says something to the effect of, The Yankees won't stop until the entire world thinks, acts and speaks as they do.As to the sudden action sequences followed by periods of little or no action, any soldier who has spent time in a combat situation can tell you that this is nothing but accurate.  War (even guerilla war) is a sequence of spending weeks of boredom and training interspersed with moments of intense violence and terror.  I felt that Ride With the Devil portrayed this aspect of the conflict very well.  The bushwhackers in the film talked about things and did things that real bushwhackers would have done during the war. To me, the accuracies in costume, weaponry, fighting and living conditions were astounding.  I was hooked the moment I saw the upturned US belt buckle in the scene where Jake and Jack take revenge for Jack's family's death.  The speech given to the bushwhackers to persuade them to raid Lawrence, Kansas, and the raid, itself, were both very well done and appeared to be very well researched.As to the actual depth of the characters, themselves, it may seem that there is nothing to admire about Jake and his drift-along way of looking at things and living, but that is where the average amateur film critic is wrong.  Many of the men who fought in the war had no deep-rooted convictions about the side on which they served.  Indeed, there are far too many circumstances where we know that men switched sides (especially in the West) periodically for their own well-being or that of their families.  The character of Jake Rodell (Toby McGuire) is typical of the men who fought in that part of the country, merely trying to stay alive and enhance himself in the eyes of his neighbors at the same time.  Jake exhibits the traits of mercy, gratitude and civility far more than any of the other characters in the film.  He is meant to stand out from the other characters as the one true vestige of decency left in a world turned upside-down.One last thing about this film if you want to have a good look at how outlaws and known men like Frank and Jesse James got their start, (the similarities are numerous throughout the movie) and would like to better understand why men like the James brothers never stopped fighting the war, watch Ride With the Devil.  It is a well-researched historical production that shows things from a mostly non-biased (or at least not the typical Yankee textbook way...which, by the way, we get sick of seeing here in the South) viewpoint.

That means total attention to detail, realistic dialogue and characterisation that makes one understand these people who are on the run for their lives.We've all known that Ang Lee could direct, for most that would start with his 'Sense & Sensibility', which shocked an awful lot of people, for a Taiwanese to turn in such a great film, his first film In English and about that elitist of film genres - the English period drama. For some of us others, who've tried to check out his earlier stuff, there's his excellent 'The Wedding Banquet'. I've yet to find a region 2 copy of his 'Eat Drink, Man Woman', though, unfortunately.After 'Ride With...' many many more found his favour with 'The Ice Storm' and then legions more with 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.Anyways, 'Ride With the Devil' will always find more favour with the Sunday evening older population than the popcorn brigade as the film goes at its own pace, not ours. It's not hard to keep up with the measured pace but does require some concentration. For those that do can be rewarded with a textured story of depth, that is also beautifully filmed and well acted. There are no special effects, CGI or tricks of any kind.

The partisans on both sides, frankly, were intent on payback, on settling old scores, resolving generational feuds and grievances which they had inherited in many instances from fathers and grandfathers who had migrated to Missouri from elsewhere.  (The call of these ancient grievances was such that even a family's black slave could feel their pull and identify with them more than with a pro-Unionist outloook which was ostensibly more to his personal advantage, a point which Ang Lee ably illustrates here.)Most of the film's characters -- save, primarily, for the failed schoolteacher-turned guerilla leader William Quantrill (here portrayed hypnotically, chillingly by John Ales) -- are apocryphal.  This makes them no less real or authentic.  (Jesse James, as one example, was no older, nor less baby-faced, than the fictional Jake Roedel when he joined his childhood friends --and older brother Frank -- in the bloodbath.)What makes this film succeed?  Several things.There's a sense of objectivity, for one a lack of judgment, based on the larger issues at hand, an insistence on examining its characters on their own merits and motivations -- rather than what others on either side might insist were the larger issues -- and which leads us to treat them as individuals.  There's also an uncanny sense of time and place, which speaks as much to screenwriter James Schamus' dialogue (it captures both the relatively declamatory nature of even the common man's speech of that era as well as the post-romantic notions which Walter Scott's novel had imparted) as to the sense of pacing and nuance which Lee imposes upon the film.  There's an uncanny feeling of You Are There (minus Walter Cronkite's narrative in that '50s TV program), but there's also a sense of ultimate optimism, a feeling that this nation (personified by at least one of the film's characters) will grow -- and flourish -- beyond the conflict here depicted.  A sense that the evil which individual men might commit for their own ends may well yet subordinate itself to the ultimate good of all.It's a film well worth watching.  Again and again.

You might have a much more conflicted look on middle America (SW Missouri and E Kansas territory) rather than the idealized Tara plantation with its Irish family connotations;  you might have people dying right and left versus the relatively bloodless plot of Margaret Mitchell's novel about N Georgia; and you might need to actually pay attention to the historical particularities of the 1860-5 era as this Taiwanese-American director does when he utilizes a modern novel like WOE TO LIVE ON.  I still haven't seen Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Best Oscar for Foreign Film this past year) but I heard some Oscar buzz that he was well-versed with diverse settings in his films (from San Francisco to Connecticut to Victorian England) and a capable and faithful literary director. What I viewed on video recently makes me want to sound a vote of full assent!  This film, RIDE WITH THE DEVIL (1999), is a solid film that stays true to a single visionary idea the American Civil War was fought by soldiers and armed personnel firing one gun at a time, in all the most despicable of ways and only infrequently with noble ends in mind.  The screenplay is a bit mystifying and reading the original novel helps only somewhat.  The visuals though are entrancing and the concept is undoubtedly more like the actual Civil War front lines and side-battles (like Lawrence,Kansas when Quantrill led his raiders) must have been less a politically correct contest between those for freedom and tolerance and racist slavery-lovers.  Ang Lee displays in this 2-hour epic more of a whirlwind of revenge and tornados of cruel shots fired on enemies and allies during firestorms of hellish mayhem than the 1939 film benchmark.  GONE WITH THE WIND was fascinating to me during my younger years. However, since re-viewing it on video recently, the hardly redeemable central character of Ms. O'Hara is really too much of a paper doll who doesn't deserve the focus of the entire film that she locks in.  What if David O. Selznick could have produced RIDE WITH THE DEVIL with an equally powerful director like the Ang Lee of 2001?  Would it have been a battle royal like he had with director Alfred Hitchcock over the novel REBECCA in 1940's Oscar-winning Best Picture? Some of the less understandable elements of this 1999 film might have been smoothed out, but then probably some other odd loose ends would have been evident in that hypothetical collaboration as well.

Towards the end of the film, he is again confronted with the meaning of marriage as he and Jewel's character discuss possibilities.The filming was done in Missouri and Kansas, the setting of the book upon which it is based.

How many movie directors in history have successfully tackled so many different cultures in so few films such a short time? The hilarious present day comedy Wedding Banquet included New York and Taiwanese characters. Sense and Sensibility was an early 19th century British costume drama treated in a fresh style. The Ice Storm looked at troubled middle class New England families in 1973. Now we have a very unusual American Civil War drama. It is not about conventional battles between large professionally organised armies. This is messy guerilla warfare on the Missouri/Kansas border. As Lee obviously understands, professional soldiers have always detested amateur partisan bands far more than their professional opponents on the other side of the battlelines who fight in conventional ways. Spanish guerillas fighting Napoleon in the 1800s, Irish freedom fighters against the British Army in the 1920s, Italian and Yugoslav partisans against the Germans in the 1940s and the Vietcong in the 1960s all incited ferocious countermeasures. The military professionals HATE these small forces who come out of the woods and mountains, deliver sudden ambushes and melt back into their native terrain like shadows. In Ride with the Devil the savagery of this style of warfare is increased by the fact that families and communities were split down the middle over the question of slavery, with regional and racial loyalties being muddled in unpredictable ways. Lee is prepared to focus nearly all the story's attention on a Confederate band whose views on slavery and race relations will be completely anathema to most modern audiences. We are allowed to see them as human beings who are desperate to defend their families and their way of life against the alien Yankees. The poignancy of their sacrifices is compounded by our knowing that they are on the losing side and that they are dying heroically to defend an utterly unjust way of life.Yet they are also shown as ruthless predators who are prepared to kill all the men in a community and destroy all their homes and property. In contrast, the enemy women are carefully spared, even when their husbands are murdered in front of them. The merciless invaders treat the ladies with old-world courtesy. But any softness in sparing even a grandfather and his young grandson is viewed as a suspicious sign of weakness and potential treason.I cannot praise the virtues of this unusual drama too highly the outstanding performances from a largely unknown (though Oscar-caliber) cast, the beautiful cinematography, the set and costume design and the overall FEEL for the period. Unlike most historical  filmmakers, Lee understands that the past is not another time - it practically another planet, whose inhabitants' attitudes may be almost incomprehensible to 1990s man. He depicts the brutality of warfare as convincingly as Saving Private Ryan, though without that film's excessive length and preposterous plot contrivances. The scene where a wounded warrior's arm has to be amputated (without anaesthetic or medical care) because the gangrene is advancing up to his armpit is almost unwatchable. Yet Lee does not need to show us all the gruesome details which Spielberg insists on shoving in our faces.Most fascinating of all are its small details which you will probably never see in another movie. The hero is from the German-American community. Although they are the largest ethnic minority in America, you practically never see the Germans mentioned in movies, unlike the Irish, Jews, Italians, Africans and so on. The hero is a virgin on his wedding night - when did you last see THAT! The female lead breastfeeds her child; when did you last see the breast used as anything, but a sex toy?Most highly recommended - 9 out of 10.

But, there is far too little of this. While the set design and costuming are spot on, the film's cinematography, by Frederick Elmes (longtime collaborator with director Jim Jarmusch), is mostly static, content to allow the scenery alone to carry the image, rather than framing it interestingly. The film's score, by Mychael Danna, is likewise rather inert, neither detracting nor adding to the images. Schamus's script has been assailed for its supposed archaic sounding dialogue (which, if one reads the Civil War era letters extant, is no problem), but it's mostly in synch with then contemporaneous idioms, and one wonders why those detractors don't rip into the bloat of so many scenes, and the length of the film, rather than the dialogue. While Jewel and Wright give performances that underwhelm (see the many scenes with Baker's character, the man who saved his life, and defends him from others' racism), and Meyers' dominates every scene he is in.The DVD, soon to be released by The Criterion Collection, is in a single disk package, with the film shown in a 2.351 aspect ratio. Extras include an insert booklet with essays by critic Godfrey Cheshire and historian Edward Leslie. Both are off the rack, while Cheshire's veers into a bit of fawning. There is an interview with actor Jeffrey Wright. It runs about half an hour, and reveals little of depth, save that Wright feels that his work and character were somehow important, as is the film. There are two audio commentaries, one by Lee and Schamus, and the other with cinematographer Elmes, sound designer Drew Kunin, and production designer Mark Friedberg. The latter one, is, by far, the superior one; and an excellent one, in its own right. It deals with the making of the film, the historicity of the film, and other aspects of the film and its place in the history of Civil War cinema. Overall, the most enjoyable of my three viewings of the film came with this commentary.But, since the artistic level of the film is so lacking, it opens up the film for scrutiny on its historical accuracy, and here, and despite Lee's protestations to the contrary, the film also fails, often abysmally. First and foremost is the treatment of the Daniel Holt character. While it is true that there were some black bushwhackers and blacks who fought for the Confederacy, the fact that Holt is treated fairly well by his three main comrades, allowed to serve side-by-side with white men, and later allowed to sleep inside the home of a white family, rather than the barn, as well as eat from their dishes, is simply implausible. If one, or possibly two, of these things occurred, perhaps there is some plausibility, but the whole string, plus several other minor PC touches? No way. If the white folks had been John Brown devotees, then this would be likely, but never in the home of Confederate loyalists, whose friends, family, and neighbors had died in support of keeping blacks in chains. The only explanation for this is Lee's almost terminal Political Correctness, evident throughout his film work, and which came to a nasty boil in Brokeback Mountain. In fact, in his commentary, Lee almost brags about his historical revisionism, by trying to recast the Civil War as the first wave of what is now modern globalization. Yet, despite the revisionism and PC, the film also bends over backward to sympathetically portray the Confederates- it makes racism almost non-existent amongst the majority of whites, as well as making that which does physically non-threatening, it treats its characters as if they were contemporary- especially in terms of sexuality, and it utterly decontextualizes Jayhawker attacks into mere terrorism while glorifying the true terrorism of the Lawrence Massacre.Unfortunately, that moment is rare in this rather mediocre film, which meanders inoffensively, somewhere between great and terrible. Watching it, I kept wondering what this raw material would have ended up being in the hands of a true master, like Michelangelo Antonioni, Stanley Kubrick, or even Martin Scorsese in his prime (he never did a Western). But, I suppose that this was the best a studio director like Lee could do. I do wonder, though, why this film was chosen to be given the Criterion treatment? It is not historically nor artistically important, and it does not even have the 'cheese' factor that some other Criterion titles do. Given the number of important and great foreign films that are neglected and unavailable in America, in good quality DVD packages (Kenji Mizoguchi's Life Of Oharu, anyone?), and given the sparse resources Criterion and other DVD companies have been devoting to new releases, one has to wonder why such an average little film as this was elevated, when it can only come at the expense of far greater films whose future audiences are left hanging. Regardless, Ride With The Devil is not a classic, nor a great, film, but Meyers' performance is one of the better performances in the Western and/or Civil War genre. It's not much, but as the Bushwhackers learnt, sometimes you just have to take what little life offers. "},{"Title":"Not Perfect, But Technically Amazing","Date":"4 August 2010","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":" Directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Ice Storm, etc.), edited by Tim Squyres (Gosford Park, Rachel Getting Married, Crouching Tiger, etc.), shot by Frederick Elmes (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Night On Earth, Broken Flowers, etc.), produced by Ted Hope (too many cool movies to name), starring loads of great people and based on Daniel Woodrell's novel, 1999's Civil War epic Ride With the Devil is one of the more interesting films of the last 20 years. Here's why &#x85;Lee, who has made some major classics in his still-young career, has also made some smaller films. Smaller, such as Lust, Caution, The Ice Storm and The Wedding Banquet, but none so small as Ride With the Devil, a film that only played on eight US screens for a total of three days - less than 120 total US showings. The difference between the small productions of Lust, Ice and Banquet and that of Devil is that Devil cost a whole lot to make. It cost as much as many of the summer blockbusters coming out around the same time.To put all that into perspective, this huge Hollywood production - mind you, that featured the work of so many great artists - was seen by less than 80,000 people in the US when it came out in late 1999. That's about the number of tickets that sell every three hours for the current No. 1 film, Inception. Also, aside from a small spike when Sam Raimi's second Spider-Man film came out (both films star Tobey Maguire), the Devil DVD has never sold or rented remotely well. So, in short, Devil is a one-of-a-kind major production in that it's beloved by critics and industry types, yet almost no one else has seen it. Some film buffs even consider it to be the best civil war film ever made.There were no billboards or ads promoting Ride With the Devil. Maguire and Lee didn't go on talk shows and newspaper's didn't run Roger Ebert's review of the film. No soundtrack, no cross-marketing, no nothing. There are six theories often discussed when talking about why, after completion, Devil saw the studio treatment it did 1) Matt Damon was originally signed on to star, but dropped out after the film had already gone into pre-production; 2) director Ang Lee was not given final cut of the film; 3) the studio heads simply thought the movie was awful; 4) the film tested poorly in the UK (only partially true); 5) a whole lot of loudmouth history buffs made public issue of a few inaccurate details; and 6) people hated the idea of a true-to-life sub-plot featuring a black man, John Noland, who joins the Confederate Army.So no, people did not seen this movie, but they might now. The Criterion Collection just released what they're calling the definitive cut of the film on both DVD and Blu-ray. The difference? Well, for starters, many of those original problems are no longer relevant. The main issue, the editing, has been fixed, Lee re-cutting the entire film in late 2009 on his own dime. So now, after 10 years, it's here, the much discussed yet little-seen Civil War epic from Ang Lee, out on shelves just waiting for your cinephile hearts.What do we at the Screen time offices think of the movie? Well, it's fantastic. Of course it's fantastic. Or, should we say, pretty much anything cinematographer Frederick Elmes photographs is worth feasting your eyes on. He's one of the best working today, topped only by Christopher Doyle, Roger Deakins, Robert Richardson, Janusz Kaminski, Bruno Delbonnel, Vilmos Zsigmond, John Toll and a very few others. So yes, Ride With the Devil is a beautiful movie to look at &#x85; in fact, as is the case with every Ang Lee film, all of the technical elements are handled incredibly well.The cast? Well, Maguire shares the lead duties with Skeet Ulrich and the great Jeffrey Wright. If that's not enough, check out this list of supporting actors Jonathan Rhys-Meyers; Mark Ruffalo; Tom Wilkinson; Simon Baker; James Urbaniak; Jim Caviezel; Jonathan Brandis and even the super underrated Margo Martindale. We were sold at Ruffalo, Wright and Wilkinson, though Urbaniak and Rhys-Meyers are great as well.So is Devil the best Civil War film ever? Meh. Nah, we can't agree with that, though we would agree that it's likely the best made Civil War film ever. As far as the best all around Civil War pictures, go, we'd probably go with either Edward Zwick's Glory, John Huston's The Red Badge of Courage or even Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain. Lee's final cut is a fine one, sadly though, Screen time can't quite give this movie the classic rating so many seem ready to give it. The cinematography and coloring are amazing. Amazing. But the storytelling and direction is too often forgettable for such high accolades. As great as the movie is, I get the feeling that, at times, Lee found the script tedious.So how then, you ask, did Ride With the Devil make the prestigious Criterion Collection cut? Well, from what we gather, similar to when they did releases for The Rock and RoboCop, the folks at Criterion added Devil to their collection because, technically speaking, it's that well made. It's the kind of movie that any future Civil War film projects will have to consider before going into production. Is it the kind of movie you'll watch over and over again? No, in fact, unless you're as in love with the cinematography as I am, you might even struggle to finish it the first time.

Fantastic job depicting 1860's Missouri/Kansas.  The plot was the only weak part.  There appears to be several holes in the plot, like some scenes were deleted (to make it shorter?).  The film is a little long, but the plot holes only make it seem longer.  There are several little things in the movie that happen so fast and just pass by that you'll probably miss them the first time you watch them.

"},{"Title":"Slow starting, but finally very interesting Civil War Drama","Date":"2 December 2000","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":"  Ang Lee's 1999 film Ride With The Devil came and went at the US box office. Actually, to say that it even arrived is close to an overstatement -- made on a 35 million dollar budget, the film grossed less than a million in the United States and althought it was released in order to get Oscar attention, it was completely ignored. Frankly, it's easy to see why Ride With The Devil has a very peculiar rhythm and only occasionally goes where you expect it to and these things are both to its advantage and its fault.Tobey Maguire and Skeet Ulrich play lifelong friends who are drawn into the ragtag skirmishes and battles that made up the Civil War in Missouri/Kansas. Both young men are Confederate sympathizers, but politically speaking it's tough to know why until a man putting the fighters up for the winter explains it Basically it's about being able to do your own thing in your own time, as Peter Fonda explained it in Easy Rider. It's about being able to live your way of life and not being forced into another even if it happens to be obviously more fair. To which one can only say, OK.But as war films go, Ride With the Devil is plot-light and character-heavy. At times the script (by frequent Lee collaborator James Schamus) seems slow and clunky (largely in the film's first act), but at other times the dialogue falls in to a uniquely relaxed pace and the film becomes structurally quite impressive. Basically, there's little going on at the surface that you haven't seen before. In war, some people are innocents, stunned by the brutality of the endeavor, but still bound to fight for honor, dignity, or some code. We've got Toby Maguire to fill that roll. Then there are some people who fight with a passion bred of revenge. James (or Jim) Caviezel there for that. And sometimes people just fight because they're more than a little bonkers. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers fits that bill.You also know that since the film's leads take the side that we're raised to believe was wrong,  there'll be a character inserted so that our heroes can show dignity and tolerance. Jeffery Wright, as a freed slave who may not really be so free, takes that job.Ride With The Devil's greatest virtue is an amazingly assembled cast. Somewhere down the road this film will be rediscovered (or perhaps simply discovered) when it becomes clear how many amazing actors are on display. Toby Maguire has already established himself as a leading man capable of carrying a film. His talent at playing man-children has been used to great effect in excellent films like Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules. James Caviezel is a star waiting to happen. While I would view him as a less quirky (and also slightly less talented) Billy Crudup, he holds the screen well and knows how to deliver a line with emotional gravity. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers may be an actor designed for British costume dramas, but trust me, the guy can act. And Jeffrey Wright, who broke out with Shaft, but has a Tony and several fine performances in indie films, is simply a fine actor. For reasons discussed above, his character is crucial to any success the film can have and he ably carries the burden as much as he's able. Oh and Skeet Ulrich isn't bad. The fact that he looks like Johnny Depp, but doesn't act as well is a bit of a drawback, but the movie does not fall when he's on screen. In smaller appearances, Mark Ruffalo (currently breaking out onscreen in You Can Count On Me) and Jonathan Brandis give solid support.As for Jewel, there are two ways of looking at her performance in this film. The first Does she damage the film in any way at all? Answer Nope. She's perfectly serviceable and sometimes even very good. The second question Since she inevitably got the part because she's Jewel, could the part have been better played by a more experience actor? Answer Of course the part could have been better played by a more experienced actor. The question of who comes to mind, but whatever... It can only be said that she is fine.Ride With The Devil rises to no obvious military climax, so all of the weight of the film must be on a series of emotional high points in the final act. It's worth noting that the film improves as it goes along, ending on a number of satisfying notes.It's of course a little tempting to wonder why Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director best known for intimate family dramas, would want to make a movie about the US Civil War and if it was a good decision on his part. In the early goingthat question seems valid. The brief preamble centering on the split in the Missouri community between Union and Confederate supporters is supposed to pack a punch that carries the movie.  It fails, as do the first few encounters involving the band that Ulrich and Maguire run with. Around 30 minutes in, though, things start getting interesting. Of course this occurs around the time Wright's character begins to be foregrounded. Anyway, Lee produces an ample epic sweep and is very comfortable with the slow build of the various relationships. The cinematography by Frederick Elmes is beautiful even if all of the actors he's shooting seem to have designer dirty faces with designer scruffy beards and designer hair extensions.Ride With The Devil requires a little work. It's not the obviously crowd-pleaser that, say, Glory is. And probably it's not as good a movie as that Civil War effort. If you can make it through the bumpy parts at the beginning, though, the rewards are there.I'd probably give it a 7 out of 10.

I wish I had known about the filming of Ride with the Devil, I would have been there.   Ang Lee should be recognized for his work in this project.   Jewel added a homespun gracefulness to her part. Toby Mcguire, a rugged simplicity ; and Skeet Ulrich a unpredictable forcefulness to his part of Jack Bull Chiles. (Thanks Matt Damon for turning Skeet's part down.

It's one thing to produce the compelling scores in Gettysburg  and Glory, but its quite another to incorporate grandeur with the simplicity of the period. (Edleman and Horner, take note.) This movie will not get the recognition it deserves, because it's not P.C. enough.

It stands out from the rest with its fluid weaving of history, drama, unexpected humor and characters all set against a striking backdrop of one of the blackest periods in American history - The Civil War.  Most of the action takes place in and around the area of the midwest where I grew up, but I'm not as familiar with the particulars of historical accuracy as I'd like to be.  To me, that's not the real point anyway.  The movie was based on a novel, set in the 1860's, and focuses on characters who fight for the south in the war.  One of the best things about the film is the way that it portrays the two sides, glorifying neither while allowing the audience to see the forces that drove so many men to kill one another - loyalty, friendship, vengeance, fear.As an American, a movie like this will really make you think about your country and its sometimes inglorious past.  Wonder what you would have done in the same situation.  More than most films do for me, at least.The acting is solid, something I was worried about with the relatively unproven cast.  Even Jewel acquits herself admirably.  And the direction by Ang Lee is superb.  Most of the action takes place in the early going, and she handles the frenzy as well as any grizzled director could hope to do.  I don't think I've ever seen a war movie directed by a woman, so kudos to Ang for breaking ground with such a stunning piece of work. 9.5 out of 10.  Go see it and make yourself think.

It has some of the wittiest dialogue in recent memory, with the banter between Tobey Maguire and Jewel matching the best Tracy-Hepburn repartee. The plot moves steadily but surprisingly - never racing ahead (hence the viewer who found it slow) but also never telegraphing what's going to happen next. With most movies it's easy to tick off plot point one, reversal, climax, but with Ride with the Devil the structure is buried deeper than that. The themes are also profoundly understated. The friendship between Maguire and the black slave humanizes the Civil War. It also shows why it's far more interesting to make the heroes southerners fighting AGAINST emancipation (who then have more to learn), as opposed to conventional good-guys with their moral compasses neatly pointing in the politically correct direction.Jewel has such a well-written and lively role that it would be almost impossible for her to screw it up. Many other actresses could have played the part; however, it's to Jewel's credit that she doesn't seem out of her league here.I sat through heaps of films during the Toronto Film Festival. This one stood out above flashier critical darlings like American Beauty. I'll even go so far as to say that the horseback-riding, pistol-waving battle scenes were some of my favourite moments, and I normally hate macho stuff. This film earns its epic big-screen glory.

The rich countryside beauty and reenactment style horse skirmishes involve us in the thrill and adrenaline rush of the young warriors. When there are strict social rules, men can exhibit broader emotions and asexual brotherly love. A second theme is what happens to women in the chaos of civil war. The irony is the scene of a woman watching her husband shot and her business destroyed saying kill me too but the soldier saying Mam, we don't hurt women. The debutante Sue Lee lost two men and is reduced to doing farm work. Wilma teaches Sue Lee how to be a mother and wife, Ort demands that Jake either husband Sue Lee or leave. To save face, Jake had previously reassured Cave Wyatt's social pressure (It ain't right not to marry her...Duchy are you that kinda man?) and since Holt wants him to marry Sue Lee, he accepts fate. However, it is on his own terms. He wasn't afraid of sex with Sue Lee, but since she wasn't his sweetheart and a known game player (Are you lying now?), he stubbornly stood his ground until she came to him, exampled by the wedding night. He would have allowed a marriage of convenience and taken care of her, he made no sexual demands. Sue Lee had to come forward and make love to him, thus it was she who consecrated the marriage vows. The symbol of the clean shave and Ort, the last adult male left alive, cutting Jake's curls to bring him into the circle of married men is as heartening  and the reality that after war, the surviving men get the babes.

Ride With The Devil certainly appears to have done so; many have complained that the events are fictitious, that real-life heroes and villains of the Civil War are ignored, that the movie is inauthentic. This is a shame as they are missing the point. Ride With The Devil, like most Westerns and most war films, is not about its environment. It is about hardship, loyalty, struggle, affection, betrayal, compromise and love &#150; all the things that come with human relationships.Ang Lee is possibly the most thoughtful and sensitive director working today and he has made another fine film. This has a far more sprawling setting than the excellent Sense & Sensibility and The Ice Storm, but this movie's characters are no less finely drawn and the director imbues each with colour and heart. He is well served by a quality cast the always superb Tobey Maguire as Dutchie, a startlingly good Skeet Ulrich (real name Bryan) as Jack Bull, Jeffrey Wright strong and pensive as Holt and a viciously brooding Jim Caveziel, in one of the best and most intense bit-parts you'll see, as Black John. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is also wonderfully petulant and dislikeable as Mackeson. Jewel, in fairness, acquits herself no more than adequately, but it's inspired casting nonetheless. Her open face and childlike beauty lends itself well to the complex role of the young widow Sue Lee and she surprises us at every turn.The film skirts around the issues of sex and race in the period without really confronting them, which is a shame. Ang Lee, though, is always at his strongest when focusing on intimate relationships rather than themes, and the friendships and love struck between the characters - Dutchie and Jack Bull, Jack and Sue Lee, George and Holt - are emotionally charged and never less than believable. Ang Lee handles the action and battle scenes well while never letting the viewer forget that it is the feelings and impulses of one man, Dutchie, that drive the story on. It ends up being that strangest of beasts &#150; an intimate epic. But it works both ways it's emotionally resonant and visually splendid.Of course, it did zero box office. In the UK, however, this might be explained by the fact that - as far as I could tell - it was only showing at one cinema in the whole country, the Empire in London. I missed it during its two-week run and had to wait for video. I don't know why I'm adding this - just a plea for wider release for quality films like this, and a bit less coverage for the dismal likes of The Next Best Thing and its pathetic ilk. Please.

He has already made all kinds of movies that don't really seem to have anything in common. His most famous one is probably Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but he has also made movies like The Hulk and Sense and Sensibility. With this movie he has made a film about the American Civil War, a time period that has been used more often in movies, but because I know that Ang Lee always tries to do something original with his movies, I decided to give it a try.Ride with the Devil is situated in Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. Jake Roedel and Jack Bull Chiles are friends and they decide to join a militia called the Bushwhackers, after Jack Bull's dad is killed by Union soldiers. Jake Roedel is the son of German immigrants who normally chose the side of the Unionists and that's why he isn't really accepted by the other members of the group. Daniel Holt has a similar problem. He's black, but no slave. His friend George Clyde had bought him and offered him his freedom. That's why Holt decided not to flee to the North, but to stay in the South and to fight together with his friend at the side of the rebels. They sometimes get involved in some skirmish and then have to flee into hiding places, offered to them by the locals. One of those locals is Sue Lee, a young widow who brings them food. She and Jack Bull become lovers, but when Jack Bull becomes deadly wounded, Jake escorts her south to a safe farm, leaving the Bushwackers behind. Some of his 'friends' who never liked him all that much anyway, now not only seek for revenge on the Federals, but also on Jake...The fact that this movie looked historically accurate and didn't tell the story from the perspective of some regular soldiers, but from the irregular, rebellious side, was something that I really appreciated in this movie. Normally you only get to see the battlefields, but this movie offered me an idea of how the other fighting parties lived and acted and how the normal man and woman was confronted with the war. The story, which has been well-written, has spent a lot of time on all the aspects of life, so not only on the fighting and that's very good. What I also appreciated was the acting. With Tobey Maguire as the only big name and Jewel in a leading role, I had some doubts about what the acting would be like. But I admit that it all looked a lot better than what I feared. Especially Jewel proved to be capable of playing a leading role. I guess I should have known better. Ang Lee isn't the least of directors and I'm convinced that the man can spot real talent, even in people who aren't very famous for their acting.All in all this is an enjoyable movie that shows a different aspect from the Civil War. It may sometimes be a bit slow, but overall this is an enjoyable movie that is able to keep you interested for over two hours. I really appreciated this movie and that's why I give it a 7.5/10.

These were people from the deep south where there army was not fighting (further up north, if you were inlisted) and taking care of their families and friends and neighbors.  The story showed how the main character learned tolerance (became friends with a negro) and showed that compassion to others, mabey saving himself from a same fate, as he was not born in the south, but german.  It shows a side ot the civil war that you never see. I thought it was great, I loved how they spoke historically acurat, instead of modern(a la Robinhood).  I don't feel it was pointless, it was more about one man's journey, than about a war.

Lee, acclaimed director of Sense And Sensibility and The Ice Storm, scores a winner in yet another genre with this story of a group of southern renegades battling union soldiers.The first hour of the film sets the world of these bushwackers as they seize several towns in bloody shoot-outs with federal soldiers. We also learn the men are not fighting for the continuation of slavery, but the preservation of Southern society as is.  The film is at its best as it focuses on the personal lives of Jake (Tobey Maguire), Jack Bull (Skeet Ulrich), and Holt (Jeffrey Wright), the two whites and a black scout guarding a pro-south family in Missouri. Jewel is the widowed daughter-in-law of this family and immediately takes a liking to Jack Bull.After the family flees for Texas, the men drop Jewel and bounce back and forth between traveling solo and with the bushwackers. The film always travels parallel to the war with some symbolic references made between the bushwackers' battles and the Civil War. Lee makes a strong statement for the cause of these men in the name of fighting until the death for what you believe in, but it will be difficult for most to empathize with those basically battling for the South.It is a sincere shame that what should have been independent star Jeffrey Wright's coming-out party was crashed by the craziness surrounding Jewel's debut. Wright is outstanding with both Jewel and Maguire providing adequate support.The biggest reason for the film's success, however, is Lee's delicate direction. He sets very well another era unfamiliar to movie-goers and paces the film very well (the 219 never seem arduous). Ride With The Devil gets a 7.

This Taiwanese director burst into fame with The Wedding Banquet and Eat Drink Man Woman a few years ago and then moved on to Sense and Sensibility and The Ice Storm.  Now, he turns his attention to another American icon -- the Civil War.This story takes place in Missouri, a Union state with Southern sympathies. These never officially joined the Confederate army.  Instead, they formed outlaw bands, called bushwhackers, grew they hair long, and sometimes would confiscated Union uniforms which they wore over their regular clothing.The movie depicts their moral dilemma, the high drama of the times, and their supposedly heroic missions of killing storekeepers and farmers who aided the Union.  There are no stars in this movie, unless you consider Jewel the singer, well cast as a young confederate widow as a star.Tobey Macquire is cast as a young German farm boy who is derided for his heritage because the Germans were supposed Union sympathizers.  This young man is an excellent actor, full of fresh faced youth whose performance encompasses his wonder and subtle realizations as he's exposed to the horror of war.Jeffrey Wright is a freed slave who travels with the bushwhackers because of his loyalty to the young man who bought him his freedom.  He gives a fine and understated performance.Some of the acting, however, is wooden, especially in the long conversations they have about morality.  And their costumes are too new.  And the southern gentleman theme of manners and hat-tipping and politeness to women comes across as a bit much -- especially since they make it a point to murder all the men who they pull from their women's arms, then burn down the stores and houses.While I don't think that this will go down as one of Lee Ang's great movies, I did find myself fascinated by it, in spite of the slow parts and its excessive length of 140 minutes.  I was interested in what was happening next and felt empathy for each of the characters who all came across as real and imperfect human beings caught up in the forces of history.Not as much action as the usual war movie, but yet still recommended -- especially for Civil War buffs.

The squalor of the civil war is not much in evidence here - the story follows a group of post-war marauders, so there are no massed battle scenes - and nor is the politics, in a simple tale of people defending their land. The pro-confederacy heroes are made sympathetic by their unprejudiced friendship with a (saintly) black man, and while there's a small hint that this is not universally popular among their compadres, there's no real acknowledgement of the fact that their cause is an extension of the fight for slavery or that the resistance, within a few years, morphed into the Ku Klux Klan. Tobey Maguire, in the lead role, struggles to give it the gravitas it needs, while the plot expects us to believe he kills fifteen men while remaining completely sexually innocent. But the strangest part of the script is the way that it jumps over the crucial transition in this character's life, from good-hearted farm boy to cold-blooded killer. The story effectively tells of his re-humanisation; but the failure to properly chart his prior revolt means that those fifteen bodies remain an aberrant item on his C.V., not fully consistent with the portrayal we are shown. This is not an awful film, and although long, I found time passed quite quickly when watching it; but for such a long movie, and one with such a weighty subject matter, I was a little disappointed with how little it actually has to say.

Lee has helmed a variety of films in different settings and eras, among them Sense and Sensibility, Brokeback Mountain, Hulk, The Ice Storm, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Life of Pi. This complex, multi-gray shaded tale boasts a number of robush performances from a stellar cast featuring Tobey Maguire, Jim Caviezel, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Simon Baker, Jeffrey Wright, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, Skeet Ulrich, and Jewel Kilcher. Jake 'Dutchy' Roedel (Tobey Maguire of Spider-Man) and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich of Scream) are Missouri natives who ride with the First Missouri Irregulars, notoriously known as the pro-Confederate Bushwhackers. Leading this disheveled, unkempt bunch is sinister Black John (Jim Caviezel of Person of Interest) and murderous Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys Meyers of The Tudors) who hate the Unionists with a fervor. Riding alongside them too are George Clyde (Simon Baker of Smith) and his African-American sidekick Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright of Casino Royale), and these combatants live off the land. The remote action transpires in anonymous woods, hills, valleys, and densely thatched woods. Eat Drink Man Woman scenarist James Schamus has adapted Daniel Woodrell's 1987 novel ''Woe to Live On. Lee and he go to extraordinary lengths to capture the dialects and eccentric linguistic manner of speech like a period western rather than an anachronistic Hollywood shoot'em up with popular dialogue. Ride with the Devil isn't just another Civil War tale. Lee and lenser Frederick Elmes make it look like the wood cut photography from the era. Myers makes a terrific villain, and our hero and he have a dramatic showdown at the end. Lee's gunfights are well staged but never obscenely bloody. The Lawrence raid is especially brutal but realistic unlike the one sanitary version in Quantrill's Raiders. After the raiders have evacuated the town, a youngster finds a drunken raider passed out in a store. He takes his revolver and before the raider can brandish his own gun, the youngster shoots him. This is the kind of movie where realism is stressed, particularly in the scene when Jake has to amputate Jack Bull's arm in their hovel in the middle of the woods. The costuming is as authentic looking as it can be. Genuine Civil War buffs will enjoy this outstanding opus. Ride with the Devil ranks as the best border war adventure on film.

Stilted, wordy, over done, florid, yet with a touch of a Southern drawl to it. Some of the letters that are read you are sure they are real. Most important, what they say makes sense and the unusual way they phrase things is humorous and very entertaining, yet realistic. Not an easy thing to do. The young actors are brilliant. Tobey Maguire shows he is so much more than Spidey and Jewel is so natural you can't imagine she is acting. The whole cast is perfect.This movie has a few scenes in it that are all time greats. Not an easy thing to do as movies are now into their 100th year of being made. In fact, almost every scene is quotable. The authenticity of the dialog is matched by the battle scenes. It is guerrilla warfare, small scale and intensely close quartered. This movie doesn't miss on any level. The dialog scenes between the main characters is unforgettable and some of the best ever made in Hollywood's history. To mention one scene or another would be to disparage the other three dozen of them. If you want to see a lesser known movie, for no fault of it's own, that is perfect, see this movie. Great acting, action, dialog, and Ang Lee is one of the modern greats. He proves it with this jewel, total pun intended.

In Devil, Roedel's a soft-spoken, timid kid who seems to want no part in the erupting Civil War. Indeed, it is only in response to the violence committed by Unionists, and the peer-pressure exerted by fellow Southerners, that Roedel takes up a sixshooter and starts killing Bluecoats. Like the hero of Lee's Hulk, Roedel essentially morphs from a man to a beast, a six-shooter equipped Bushwacker who kills without batting an eyelid. What's odd about Devil, though, is the subtly at which these changes occur. As the film progresses, Roedel shifts from a genteel kid to a killer and then back to a genteel family man. Similarly, a character called Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright) shifts from an outright slave to a man bound to an unspoken life-bond and finally to a free African American. Throughout the first half of Devil, Holt is virtually invisible. And when he is addressed, it is often indirectly or in the form of a racial slur. Gradually, however, Lee brings Holt to the forefront of his picture. Holt questions why he is fighting for segregationists, racists and observes first hand the hypocrisies of the Confederate cause. The film then ends with Holt and Roedel addressing one another by their full personal names. In affirming their identities, both are asserting a freedom or sense of self not bound by place, time or ideology. But Lee knows this is but a feeble affirmation; his film ultimately asserts that identity is always subservient to history. One seldom owns who he is.Devil is bookended by a pair of weddings. During the first, Roedel likens marriage to slavery, and chastises any man who'd wed a woman. Through a bizarre sequence of events, however, Roedel finds himself forced to marry the pregnant lover of a close friend. Ironically, it is this enslaving wedding which emancipates Roedel from the war. As husband and father he's thrust into a new role, a role which carries with it a clear set of pre-packaged actions; flee the conflict and protect his new family. In countless similar scenes, the sheer arbitrariness of history, identity and so belief and behaviour, is highlighted. Take sequences, for example, in which Roedel's rejection of the beliefs of his German American father have little to do with Roedel's understanding of Unionist causes, and more to do with an unspoken loyalty to his neighbours. These neighbours' hatred of Roedel &#x96; he's seen to be a traitorous immigrant - is likewise capricious; Roedel fights for the South, IS a Southerner, but they nevertheless hate him because of the identity of Roedel's German father. Unsurprisingly for a film preoccupied with how roles and rituals are unconsciously play-acted, Ride with the Devil systematically undercuts and subverts the expectations typically brought to films set in the American Civil War. Such films typically revel in the splendour of antebellum Southern life, unironically celebrating and sentimentalising the luxury and civility made possible by the horrors of chattel slavery. But Lee, though he also ignores any overt depictions of slavery, never romanticises either the North or South. Both sides are brutal, horrible, but both are also humanised and shown to be swept up in movements they don't quite understand. In several scenes, for example, we watch as Confederate militiamen go to lengths to exhibit proper etiquette (directed at both blacks and women), and yet in others we witness bloody raids, like one sequence in which Confederates massacre 180 civilians in Lawrence, Kansas. Such juxtapositions make it spookily clear how easy it is for social animals to ride with devils. Everyone's swept up in something, and humans are rarely strong enough or smart enough to break chains of complicity.For all its attempts at revisionism, though, Ride with the Devil is still quite tame. Lee's Civil War ultimately boils down to good Unionists and evil, racist, Confederates. That both sides were acting with profit, greed and the interests of land owners &#x96; which happened to coincide with the abolition of slavery - is ignored. For all his revisionism, Lee ultimately offers an idealistic portrait of the times. The great film about the American Civil War is still yet to be made.8/10 &#x96; Excellent, and one of the better westerns (though set in eastern Mississippi) of the 1990s. See Shenandoah, Pontecorvo's Burn, Hombre and The Beguiled. Worth two viewings.

But in the end, I found the movie to be greatly uneven. On the positive side, the movie feels authentic, from the props and costumes to the locations chosen. The acting by all the players is also professional and helps sell the characters the actors play. On the other hand, the screenplay misses some key moments that might have given the characters more detail. For instance, we see precious little of the hero before the incident that pushes him to be a raider, and then the movie skips a year ahead to show him in midstream. A bigger problem is that the movie is too long. While the movie never gets to the point of being boring, it seems to be taking its sweet time during many moments. The movie also ends at a point that kind of leaves its characters hanging; I would have liked to have seen a more definite resolution. This is not an awful movie, but it's greatly uneven, and I can understand why despite its strengths, the major Hollywood studio that bankrolled the movie in the end only gave it a limited theatrical release.

This film is beautifully produced, but not very engaging for much of its run. Maguire in the lead doesn't help at all. He can be a decent actor in the right circumstances, but he doesn't fit into the Civil War that well. Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon were both considered for the role, and Damon, in particular, would have been great in it (I think DiCaprio was still kind of a weak actor at the time, though he would have been better than Maguire). The film gets a bit better as it goes along, particularly when the main thrust of the story, the relationship between Maguire and a black man fighting on his side (Jeffrey Wright) emerges. Then there's the raid on Lawrence, Kansas, which is a fantastic and horrifying centerpiece. Wright gives a fine performance, but my favorite performance in the movie belongs to Simon Baker, who plays Wright's master. Yes, Jewel co-stars. She might be the reason that no one took this movie seriously when it first came out, but she's not half bad, really.

I enjoyed how Tobey and Wright slowly develop a close friendship, as well as Wright's growing sense of freedom as the story progresses. Jewel makes an impressive acting debut and should do more films, she's a natural.One reviewer erroneously stated that the film ran 3 hours so I was surprised when the credits started rolling at the 2 hour and 13 minute mark. In fact, I was disappointed because I wanted the story to continue; this is a sign of a good film. The story takes its time and gradually pulls you in.Before viewing Ride with the Devil I caught the new Indiana Jones flick Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. The contrast couldn't be more different -- Crystal Skull is essentially a 2-hour Road Runner cartoon, whereas Ride is a totally realistic drama/Western. Although I enjoyed Crystal Skull for what it is, it can't be taken serious for even a second, not to mention they overdid it with the over-the-top action and fake cgi location enhancements & props (cliffs, waterfalls, jungles, monkeys, etc.). Ride with the Devil is the perfect antidote to such loony-toon drivel. It's totally realistic and takes its time so you get to know the characters and FEEL their experiences. For instance, what's it like spending the entire Winter in a dugout hut in the woods with three other guys and the only highlight is some cute blond stopping by to drop off food? What's it like when you have no other recourse but to saw a buddy's arm off? What's it like when a blood-thirsty comrade tries to kill you during battle? What do you do when you run into him two years later and you're not sure what his intentions are? The film was shot in Western Missouri and Eastern Kansas where the conflicts actually took place. Authentic locations are vital to this viewer. After all, how are we to accept the film's visualization of history if it wasn't shot where the actual events occurred? I encourage you to view the film with the subtitles on as the language is sometimes hard to understand due to accents and archaic phrasing; this will help you follow what's going on and who's who.FINAL ANALYSIS Ride with the Devil is reminiscent in quality & style of films like Cold Mountain, Pharoah's Army and The Long Riders. If you appreciate those films you'll enjoy Ride. It's leagues better than the generally aloof and soporific Gettysburg. It's a class 'A' picture which brings to life Quantrill's raid on Lawrence, Kansas, including what leads up to it and what follows -- how can you go wrong?The DVD includes Jewel's music video for the song What's Simple is True.

Jake and Daniel take Sue and flee Missouri eventually making their way West.This is a brutal disturbing movie about a previously untold, on film at least, part of the American Civil War where your enemy may have lived as far as the next farm. You couldn't be sure who were your friends were sometimes and the wrong beliefs may have gotten you lynched. It's easy to see that the Jake Roedel's character doesn't believe in the institution of slavery but rather the principles of freedom and independence. He goes along with the Bushwackers against his dad's wishes due to so many of his friends taking up their cause. His life changes and not all for the good with the choices he makes, but by the end he's made peace with the man he was and now is.

It is refreshingly absent all those toy soldiers lining up across a field and slaughtering each other with reluctant glee. This is more about character, tradition, changing paradigms, and cultural considerations.It is part action and part History and part Sociology, combining to tell real-life events intruding on real-life Families caught in the midst of this insanity. The Movie has a scriptural charm of past dialects and speech patterns delivered by Actors ranging from competent to excellent performances. It is up to Tobey Maguire to carry this and he is more than capable despite his limited physical stature and less than resonant voice. But mostly his eyes and effortless posturing are pleasingly possessive.The Film also benefits from a smooth, lack of flamboyance, and keen eye from the Director and together with the Screenplay and fine Cinematography this is a welcome entry in an overloaded Movie cannon that has dealt with this struggle with inconsistent frequency.

The War was miserable enough for anyone involved in it, but as the introduction to this movie describes, it was especially horrible for families caught on the borders and outlying areas of the conflict, such as western Missouri and Bleeding Kansas, the locales in which Ride with the Devil takes place.Toby Maguire, Skeet Ulrich, and Jewel turn in fine, occasionally outstanding performances as three Missourians caught up in the struggle, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers lends a chill throughout the story, as a sadistic Rebel who fights only for the joy of killing. But Jeffrey Wright is superb in the film's most difficult role, playing an ex-slave who fights on the side of the Rebels, for his own complicated personal reasons.The dialog is a bit uneven, with the rebel Bushwackers declaiming in almost Shakespearean diction for the first part of the movie, and later lapsing into modern colloquial speech and Hollywood cliches toward the middle and end, but this change may have been a semi-successful attempt to convey the deflation of Southern pomp and bravado that the movie documents.  In general, the story and direction seem to sag a little towards the end, but are redeemed by the last few scenes.  Ride with the Devil is a powerful, moving depiction of the most awful episode in our nation's history, and well worth seeing.

It begins with its hero riding determinedly, to arrive at a wedding, and for the rest of the film, the horizontal movement of horses across the Missouri frontier is the signature image of a film about an incoherent, brutal war which never stays in one place long-- our Bosnia-- as it played out in the Missouri hinterlands. The film has problems-- stylized dialogue  spoken in flat, barely inflected tones (a fair amount of it not quite intelligible), and a narrative heart that is defined only after about an hour, when Jeffrey Wright's character becomes prominent.  The pluses include a real epic sweep, beautiful stunt work mostly involving horses, and an unemphatic moral viewpoint that is best-displayed in a final devastating image of the film's most hateful character.

Although as in some Westerns, it's the men who get drunk and fight, while women (and the men who adopt their values) are the civilising forces.I liked the way ordinary people were thrust into an extraordinary situation and we could see the tussle between their will and character moving them forward, and the huge forces of warfare continually re-arranging their everyday terms of reference.Irrelevant but significant enjoyments?

I shivered with revulsion -- another Pearl Harbor. Actually, it's not badly done. Yes, the widow figures into it but the love story -- if that's what it is -- doesn't smother the larger issues that are the film's main concern.The border states and western territories were, in a sense, what the Civil War was all about. The Southern states (up to and including Delaware) were slave states; the Northern states were free. That was settled. But in the 1850s the United States was expanding westward, all the way to the Pacific. So how about Kansas and Missouri, for instance. Should they enter the union as slave states or free? Of course no one agreed and the fighting broke out before Fort Sumter in these states. The landscapes are captured here by some nice location shooting. The politics were terribly complicated and this confusion was reflected in the use of irregulars, mostly on the Confederate side. The conflicts we witness aren't the mythical sort that informed 1939's Jesse James but are grounded in reality. Somebody ought to show the thing to high school classes.The characters whose careers we track here belong to one of those irregular groups of Southerners, and they're presented in all their mortal forms -- jealous, loyal, proud, polite to ladies and children, and with varying degrees of allegiance to the cause.None of the performances are overwhelming. Toby Maguire has the lead role and he's, let's say, not prepossessing. He has a pleasant and undistinguished face and the high voice of a young man not long out of adolescence. The widow of the TV guide is warm and attractive enough but hardly ravishing.There are some weaknesses. The men all seem to have the same hair style -- Cher in the 1970s. Sometimes it's hard to keep the characters straight, even the important ones, if their appearance is brief. Characters, even the less educated, sometime speak in the perfumed language with which letters were written in those days, and sometimes not. And the U. S. Cavalry by this time should have carried breach-loading carbines as well as pistols, though no carbines are in evidence. But it's a believable story with a nice blending of action and refractory periods during which people heal from their wounds, trade information, and form bonds. It could have easily been so much worse.

This, of course, is because our referant for authenticity - of which we can know little beyond the history books - is the traditional movie Western, which has bypassed actual fact to become a sort of ingrained cultural history.  A Western that seeks to avoid or break away from its cinematic past risks seeming unsatisfying, as all Westerns since PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID have.  Peckinpah's is the last great Western - he understands how mythology is crucial to the 'truth' of the West.RIDE WITH THE DEVIL, excellent in so many ways, is a bit like THE INSIDER in that it is so good at undermining the assumptions of its genre, that it doesn't leave much left.  Ang Lee is most famous for his domestic comedies, exploring the tensions between individuals and their families, and he continues this work here.  The Western is often associated with the conflicts of civilisation and progress, of the making of masculinity, of the lure and freedom of the West, the myth of leaving one's past.  Lee invokes this myth, but, using race, subverts it.As you might expect, families dominate this film, but, unlike the ingrained conservative units of his previous films, his characters are caught up in one of the most disruptive periods in history, the American Civil War, and conventional family values are rent apart.  The opening sequence dramatises the governing conflict - a lone rider travels through beautiful forest and thickets on his way to a wedding here is the individual in a social context; nature vs. civilisation.The tensions in this civilisation are marked.  Weddings are all about union, but the guest talk about the coming War, the disunion of the States.  Even in this Southern idyll, partiality and xenophobia proclaim themselves, the cursed claims to authenticity that will tear this society apart.  Tobey Maguire is different from these people in so many ways - he is the son of a German immigrant, his father works hard for a living, his mother is dead - and, even though they treat him like a son, he feels like an outsider. As the war begins, families are destroyed - the murder of Skeet Ulrich's dad encourages the boys to join a makeshift guerrilla army; Maguire's father is murdered by a Union neighbour prisoner he's just set free.  But amid this disjunction, new families are forged which necessarily, as is true to the West, involves loosing the shackles of the past.  He befriends an ex-slave and marries Ulrich's mistress, while all his old friends lie dead.Yet all the time Maguire, ostensible hero of the film, is a very passive presence, rarely other than a quiet observer of events and more charismatic compadres.  This becomes literal in a SONATINE-type sequence, where the three friends and Jeffrey Wright, the ex-slave, recuperate, in a hidden clearing, away from the war, in a time-and-place suspended realm.  The Western usually deals with some kind of progress, even if it's just moral progress.  The white characters don't make any progress at all.  Most die; Maguire starts in a family environment, spends the war with a surrogate family, and ends the film married, 'civilised', emasculated, his wild hair and clothes rejected.  The closing scene with Jonathan Rhys Meyers, however, shows the precariousness of this 'civilisation', shows how it needs to be defended, and how the means of that defence, 'guns', are what cause the trouble in the first place.  So that the melodramatic circularity of the plot and character development figure the vicious circle America hasn't yet got itself out of.But if there's no progress for the traditional Western heroes, there is for one figure normally marginalised, or just plain ignored, in the genre.  Wright starts the film a minor, inscrutable figure, and we fear that Lee is pandering to stereotypes.  But as circumstances develop, as the Southern/Western codes are found wanting, he grows in stature as his part grows bigger, until finally all the dreams of the Western, of progress, of journeying alone into the great unknown are given to him - while Maguire, like the Easterners in old Westerns, is stuck with a wife and child, retreating from his 'manhood'.  Wright rides into the distance, uncertainty, possibility and the wide open spaces his reward.  And yet, even this is ironised his quest is his disrupted past - he looks for his mother - and this is another quest that can only reveal the darkness obliterated by the traditional Western.As one would expect with Lee, the film's uniqueness - for the Western prefers broad strokes - lies in the details; the use of physical dismemberment to figure sexual inadequacy, gender anxiety, national failure; the homoerotic elements are also pleasing in such a macho genre.  Considering the powerful sense of encroaching nature in his last film, THE ICE STORM, there is a disappointing lack of contact with nature - the play of light on the trees is beautiful, but we never get a sense of the landscape as a character, determining the fate of history's puppets. Such is the film's ominous calm, and concentration on emotion and human contact, that when the rare spurts of violence do erupt, they lacerate the screen.  The unexpected move towards a kind of comedy in the last half hour make one regret what might have been.

On the positive side, much of my father's family comes from the St. Joseph, Missouri area and, I think (from looking at my family tree) were living in that area at the time of all this pre-Civil War craziness.  So, the movie motivated me to do a little research and trace the geography of me papi's family.  This was positive.  As for the negative  It must have been very ugly to live in this part of Missouri in the 1850s and 1860s.  Uglier than the cleanness of film can ever dramatize.  Read  lots of deep psychological pain, alcohlism, gambling, lack of respect for human life, and pointless violence.

And, I know, film is supposed to be entertaining.  But why make an entertaining film about something so ugly, so painful, so not entertaining?  As for the acting, I think this is Toby McGuire's best role, but it still seems to me like he always plays the same character in every movie he has been in.

When it's combined with film, I'm in a sweet spot because it automatically adds another level to the film's being. It allows us an additional entry into the film world and means for making sense of it.Three filmmakers that have attempted meaningful work in this category Ron Maxwell, Ed Zwick, and with this film, Ang Lee. Good directors all three, all with varying methods.Griffith? No. He had the good fortune of timing as far as film history, but misfortune as far as his prejudices (shared by many others in that era) coloring American history. Today his Klan epic is no more than a curiosity.Of the modern efforts, Zwick's film, Glory, is the most anachronistic and the least accomplished. It is good-hearted and inspiring, definitely, but its technique comes from the same primitive, emotion-bating model Griffith used. Who knows how future generations will respond to its machinations? It introduced Denzel, who in almost every subsequent role has played some variation on the same noble character. Still, it was a worthy subject combined with quality craftsmanship from Zwick, ability that has long since eroded (now he is burdened by celebrity muggers such as Cruise). I credit his cinematographer for part of the Glory achievement. The Ft. Wagner assault is one of the most powerful, painterly realizations of action movement on film I have ever experienced. The whole story is worth sitting through just to reach that moment.Maxwell's double feature is the most opaque and ambitious of the group. The two films (especially Gods) are not concerned with matters of gloss nor tracing easy mythology with dazzling technique. They are about the reflexive business of history as perambulated by cinematic forces, and how the subjectivity that is endemic to history can be objectified, exploded, and finally, reconstituted, into a greater understanding of that same history's blurry parameters. By appearing simplistic his films actually fight the simplicities.Lee is somewhere between the others. He doesn't penetrate as deeply beneath the surface as Maxwell does, but he's also incapable of the same bluntness as Zwick.I think he took on this project because it was easily adaptable to the structure he's used throughout his career characters in alternating groups of two, with scene changes corresponding to tonal shifts as the pairings merge, split, and converge into others. Roedel and Jack Bull, George Clyde and Holt. Now enter Sue Lee. Sue Lee and Jack Bull, Holt now with Roedel. At the halfway point, or the pinch, there are five key persons. The death of one is involved. The pairings are uneven, so it follows that one must be hewn for parity. Sue Lee and Clyde begin to disappear from the third act. It becomes Holt and Roedel. Finally, when it becomes Roedel and Sue Lee, Holt must go. But it's a much kinder break than before, necessarily so due to the running theme of transforming redemption, something that allows a gentler gravity to emerge from the war's fatalistic din. Even the final confrontation is one of pairs, with Pitt Mackeson and Turner.These transitions and the balance between them are some of the most natural -- and complexly varied -- to be found in any of Lee's pictures. Yes, it looks great, all those seasonal changes, his camera as deeply textured and languorous as ever, but we expect that from him.Of the three filmmakers' approaches, I value Maxwell's the most. His is the deepest, the richest, actually life-changing. He's just as good as the other two at drumming up all the visual detail for us but he also moves behind it to interpolate many contextual riches. He explicates narrative mechanics, connects them with 19th century ethics, and expounds on them with a highly abstract terminology. He isn't a cinematic innovator like Kurosawa, nor as eager for Lee and Zwick's more direct dramatizations. You won't find him with a dancing camera or editorial flourishes. But I have yet to encounter anyone else who so trenchantly, so poetically, expresses both the pros and cons of cinema as an annotative tool. His tableaux style is a knowing riff on Griffith's template, an adroit framework for self-referential study on the nature of history as it's fashioned for storytelling. This is why people who approach his movies as Spielberg-type entertainments or basic history lessons tend to be disappointed. They're conditioned to seeing only surface machinations. To the extent that the Zwick and Lee films are more yielding to this conditioning, their value is diminished.But in the end these four movies support each other and, if you're interested in exploring the connection between film and this particular period in history, you must see all of them. Which do you prefer? How do you see and interpret past and present?

I rated the Audie Murphy movie a 3 (I'm a harsh grader), the second lowest I ever gave Audie (the worst being Battle at Bloody Beach if you're curious). I give this movie a rating of 8 (and I'm a harsh grader) It's the Civil War story of renegade soldiers, if you want to call them that, against the North. People like Quantrell, and the men who rode with these outlaws.The original was a watery version, very clean cut, while still depicting the horror of what these men did. Actually, movies such as the older version are best viewed by mature audiences, who can discern the story. I would be more apt to rate the original R and this one, with it's gruff nature, a GP, because the newer movie gives a very honest version, a message more easily deciphered by a juvenile than the older version.Film makers since the early sixties have boasted about Realism, but few of them deliver. Instead, they just give the drab scenery, drab costumes, and drab events, but with comic book cardboard stereotype characters, the weakness of the spaghetti era.Modern film makers have realized this mistake. It is evident in a superior style of Western we usually see today. This movie is an example. It gives the realistic settings, but also gives us characters we can believe exist in that era.It has a few lulls, which makes a complete sit through a bit hard, and it has some unexplained situations. But unexplained situations are okay as long the entire movie holds up, and the characters are intriguing enough.It begins a bit campy, but really improves. The main character is one we can identify, and at least have some sympathy for. The Audie Murphy character of the early movie really evokes no sympathy, and is too self righteous without motivation.The character in this movie follows the lines of a true anti-hero. There is motivation, and a method to his madness. We never feel he is truly right, but we can understand where he comes from.There is plenty of action in the movie. There is also some humor. One good scene is when the heroine tells the hero she wouldn't lie to him, and he mulls that over.This movie succeeds in doing what film makers have been trying to do for decades.

(it should be noted that then, even if someone was against slavery, they usually still didn't want blacks 'living like whites' in true equality, as neighbors and friends- they just didn't want them to be slaves. If you find this hard to believe, think about the national problems to this day with prejudice - the 'free the slaves' faction was, for the most part, much less noble and free-thinking than we like to think it was) This interference and coercion enraged the Kansas residents - understandably. Check into the history of some of these crazy, violent elections for an idea of how vicious and divisive this time was in the area. The Bushwackers were not Confederate soldiers, and the Jayhawkers were not Union soldiers - they were bands of citizen militia/guerillas who roamed back and forth over the borders of the states, killing each other and residents from the opposing sides, and burning/pillaging largely for local revenge - with the state's rights/freedom issue as a larger backdrop. Think Hatfield and McCoy on a much larger scale. This time, often referred to as Bleeding Kansas, is widely considered by historians to have been the spark for the Civil War.Interestingly, Kansas and Missouri still have an intense, fairly unfriendly (though veneered with pc civility) competition going which doubtless can be traced to this horrible time...it is very noticeable if you live in Kansas City, which straddles Missouri and Kansas. The University of Kansas in Lawrence basketball team is called The Jayhawks - from the Jayhawkers, of course - and Lawrence especially is rife with border war names, including Free State Brewery and Quantrill's Flew Market.This movie is beautiful, but drags somewhat. The most notable performances are Caveziel, Wright and Rhys-Meyers; with MacGuire turning in an adequate but not inspiring portrayal. Skeet is okay, but looks uncomfortable and out of place in his period costume- which seriously mars his believability. (most American actors can't pull off period clothing, unfortunately) Jewel seemed to be cast for being a popular singer, not for being a good actress. Historically it is more accurate than most Civil War era films in action, more's, props and dialogue. Caveziel is suitably enraged/vengeful in his few scenes, very convincing. Rhys-Meyers provides great flair - giving a gracefully strange, genuinely menacing personality to the psycho Pitt, who otherwise would be a cutout villain. (Why do so many guys in this country equate grace or a colorful personality with being effeminate? They are not the same thing...and it's always the guys who have no grace of movement or personality themselves who condemn it in others, unsurprisingly - oh, and men are built to have swinging hips, not women - that is only a cultural expectation, nothing more) "},{"Title":"disappointing film   (*may contain slight spoiler)","Date":"26 November 2002","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, War","Review":"  I love Ang Lee's films and I appreciate his work across all genres, so even though I don't generally like war films, I expected a good film.I was disappointed.

Enthusiasm that was, alas, somewhat let down.Acting wise, the movie is fine. Tobey Maguire is a capable young actor as he has shown in Pleasantville and Wonder Boys. Jewel shows that not all singers, in acting roles, need to have a Glitter effect and the rest of the cast credit themselves. I was initially wary of having such a teen cast in the movie, but they proved relatively unfounded - particularly since this was a movie *about* young Southern Bush-whackers.The script is what I cringe at. Here we go - American Civil War time. Again. Fair enough though, that can be done well and its a period that hasn't nearly been plundered so much as World War II or Vietnam. The movie starts off well by having characters whose morales are not clearly defined (at least in typical Hollywood style) - the gang of Bushwhackers calmly go along and gun down people without breaking a sweat. And then we get the unnecessary concession to PC as Maguire's character - Jake - befriends the black ex-slave Daniel Holt, and learns that Holt Is A Man Too. That sort of heavy-handed scripting is poor. Additionally the movie tends to drag. There's nothing wrong with being contemplative, but the movie tends to meander along aimlessly. The romance element seems half-hearted and very much done because-its-expected-to-be-done. Yes the romance was treated as a matter of honour, more than love, but it seems tacked on, as if it were a concession to fit the Hollywood mould. While a movie can plod along, it's normally okay if it has somewhere to go. The movie's ending left me going, That's it? because I felt that I had barely been on a journey with the characters, let alone finished one.Ang Lee shoots the film well. The camera is held back normally, to capture the landscape and people and not ever try and impose on the situation. It looks pretty and the violence - while in your face - is edited in such a manner that there's no traditional gallons of blood washing across the screens. The steadiness of Lee, and refusal to concede to modern MTV-style effects, works in his favour but it cannot lift the movie up from its sheer dullness and unsympathetic characters.

In a nutshell, the movie attempts to update the traditional ethnocentric foundations of the American Civil War genre.  One might say that &#145;Dances with Wolves' is a predecessor in this effort.  In modern westerns, moral authority resides in the non-white characters.  A wise indian generally has the last word.  'Ride with the Devil' tries out this formula, making a former slave the moral heart of the story.  The best I can say is 'good try.'In this new civil war tale, moral authority resides in Holt, a freed slaveI doubt that many in the audience will find the role resonates.  The role breaks a lot of traditions and fails to build a good case for believing the story. 'Gone with the Wind' established the 'expected' civil war story class struggle.  The northern merchant class and factory workers destroy the aristocratic south. In this version, slaves were 'off stage'.  The fighting was a white man's affair.Ride with the Devil tries to update the old story line. The screen writer gives us a former slave as a central character.  Despite the effort, Holt, our black hero, might as well be from Mars.  Aside from a few dead slaves piled in a heap in a battle scene, he is the only black in the movie. Despite a few words to explain his status, he does not particularly act like a former slave.  I found it impossible to overlook the many examples of friendly southerners treating him like an equal. These folks were killing anyone who offered social equality to a black! Despite an effort to imitate 1860s speech patterns, Holt talks like a white man.Others might find this engaging, but I was only confused.  I was not emotionally involved.

I'm a Southerner, and must have some historical memory.Watching the Tobey McGuire character learn to respect the dignity of a former slave, as he looks at the scalps of blacks and Germans (his ethnic background) being wagered at a poker game.....was interesting. Many twists in this movie. The wife, who is forced into her marriage, shows both lust and a strong will, characteristics we're not used to seeing in 'respectable Victorian southern belles'.The crazy wacked out renegade southerner gave me some insight into why my cousin, head of the Copeland Horse-thieving Gang, Inc. in Mississippi, was hung about that time. Bands of homeless men were roaming the countryside, armed. Remind you of Iraq? And how similar we are underneath the facade of religion and ethnic background? And why southerners are STILL fighting that civil war today.Too bad we can't use that same knowledge in our handling of the country we've just invaded and are occupying, fomenting civil war everywhere. That's Mesopotamia, now called Iraq, who happen to have the misfortune to sit on oil. The wild-eyed killers in Missouri, raiding Lawrence, Kansas could as easily be the insurgents we're fighting now with no success.Another anomaly was the father's tribute to the Yankees who move into Lawrence and erect a school even before they erect a church. And for that reason, they'll win. Huh????? I was taught history in Birmingham, Al and we were taught that the North was much more industrial and richer.....that's why they won.

God, what a horrible legacy slavery gave us.Acting pretty good, lots of blood and gore as the warriors ride gleefully into battle (but didn't hear any rebel yells, so reminiscent of football games in Alabama). You also get a real feeling for how stupid the war was, as the bushwackers and jayhawkers gather their forces for another raid. They have lost sight of why they're fighting, and so do we. Just more mindless slaughter.You're also brought up to date with the limbless kids coming home from Iraq, as the bushwacker (ahh, what connotations) first has his arm seared shut, trying to save it, then has it amputated, and then dies. So much suffering for such a stupid cause.The cinematography is fantastic. Now I have to get back to the DVD and get the production notes, one of my favorite parts of any movie. I suspect that this movie was written by a Gore Vidal, as the spoken language is of a type you would associate with that era, if you knew History. The dialogue is definitely thought-provoking. Not your ordinary blood and guts war movie, by any means. You see the wounded but still active-duty soldiers, still fighting cause they have nothing else to do. You see the southern raiders, living off the land, stealing indiscriminately. Yet, at the beginning, you've seen the battle stop, so the women could be evacuated from danger. As I read the escalating number of women and children dying in Iraq, I'm thinking, Where did we lose our sense of honor as a people? I have forgotten why I sought this movie out and bought it after 20 years, but some book somewhere lauded it. With good reason. Tobey at his best, pre-Spideyman. Buy the DVD or rent it.

It really was too long.The story is set in Civil War era Missouri, and is about a young man (Roedel) who joins the feral forces of the Bushwackers, sort of renegade Confederate sympathizers who conduct geurilla type fighting with the Jayhawkers, their Union counterparts.  He and his close friend, Jack Bull Chiles played by Skeet Ulrich, join the group after Chile's father is shot point-blank and his home is burned, presumably by Jayhawkers.  The story follows Roedel's and Chiles' raiding adventures and their interactions with other victims of the war, including former slave who fights for the Bushwhackers (Daniel Holt played by Jeffery Wright), and a war widow played by Jewel.It seemed that every time the film developed the story to an interesting point, it would turn to some other subplot and leave things undeveloped. For example, the agitation among Roedel's group caused by former slave Holt participating in the confederate cause is shown briefly through some conflict regarding propriety and protocol, and then dropped until later in the movie.  A young villian/bully Bushwhacker hates Roedel and directs much angst and violence against him, but, we never know why.   Some of the characters never seem to surface; I think that is because the movie embraces too many of them as well as taking on large amounts of history.The historical detail was excellent.

When the Civil War breaks out, Missouri is in chaos with the Union armies coming down to the north to be met by Bushwackers, irregular soldiers loyal to the confederate army. A year passes and we find Jake and Jack are both part of a group of Bushwackers led by Black John. The group fights with violence and speed but Jack's relationship with Sue Lee and his later wounding combined with Jake's friendship with black tracker Daniel Holt lead them to become disillusioned with what they are doing and start to question the point of all their violence.Following the tone he had previously established in The Ice Storm, Ang Lee surprised me by managing to produce a small scale story about a couple of individuals set in the middle of a large war. However he didn't do it as well as he did in Ice Storm and I think part of the problem was with the story as well as the characters. The story is told painfully slowly. At times this works and comes across as sensitive, at other times it comes across like it is just filling time. I'm sure that the former was the intention but it doesn't always work. I see what the film tries to do and it has potential to be an interesting anti-war film but it never pulls it off because it never really drew me in. It still was interesting and kept me with it, but it didn't have enough punch to it to really do the job.I didn't feel like I ever got to know the characters; we are given little time with them before the war so we don't see them change. The focus is during the war and we do see changes and have moments with the characters but they are not frequent enough and they come across as rather distant and cold characters &#150; all painted with the same slow Southern style and mostly failing to stand out as individuals. The direction is still beautiful and Lee does direct with both scale and sensitivity (although the later appears to be his strength here). The film looks great and has good attention to detail but I needed more in the way of accessible characters, good dialogue and a better story.The cast do OK but they all have a horrid Southern drawl that is hard to get past; I'm sure it is realistic but it is hard work to listen to. Maguire is always interesting and he is pretty good here although at times he is doing stuff without much help from the material and he does feel forced.

The support cast are all OK, be they Jewwl, Rhys-Meyers, Wilkinson, Caviezel, Ruffalo or whoever; however they all do struggle with not having the film have the pace or the material to really use them well.Overall I did really want to be all sensitive and deep and just love this film but the truth is I didn't, although I still quite liked it. The story and characters are hard to get into and I did feel like I was left a little cold by them all. The direction is good and the film looks great but the material is not there. At times it gets close to being an anti-war film painted on the lives of a few main characters but then it loses this for the most part in a slow, wandering film. Maybe worth a try once due to the quality involved but certainly not as good as I had hoped and not up to the standard I have come to expect from Ang Lee.

I had to see this movie. The movie begins... A short introduction...OK, it plays in Missouri. Special problems with the North and South of Missouri and the German settlers. It seems to be interesting... Then the first awful thing the time jumps in the beginning a year forward, and the audience doesn't know which time it is actually. I disliked it, and until the end i didn't know in which year it plays, because it jumps a lot in the time without one little date. For a historic movie, not really a good sign. The next bad thing is Tobey himself. He seems to practise for his next role in Wonderboys. This little psycho touch with the i am not here attitude and short sentences to speak, doesn't work out here. In the first minutes we have an action scene, in which Tobey looses one of his fingers. I think nice and i am now eager to see more, and i am waiting and waiting, to be very honest i am still waiting. After this little action scene Tobey and his 3 companions are spending a lot of time in a hideaway in the wood. And the movie is getting longer and longer. Now we have to learn how stupid the war is with 3 little examples First one Tobey is a German, the other Southerners dislike Germans...... Second one Jeffrey Wright plays the Afroamerican Daniel Holt, who is fighting with Southerners. (By the way, this Black-White racism, is getting more and more boring. This thing is exhausted, for sure in movies. Dear Americans, if you have to go on and on with this, take some other races, like Asians too.) And third thing are the letters from the enemy. Oh, who could have thought about it, they have the very same problems like we have.OK, i've got the message War is bad, and our heroes are between this insane thing....Next action scene, and a short one, the farmers house got arsoned and Tobey shoots the perpetrators. Then we have the next action scene with an insane attack on Kansas City, in which the suspension is built up between Tobey and an evil crazy man. Now the audience is waiting for the result in this case. You think that there will be a last shoot out between the two, a nice action scene....And the end Tobey invites his enemy in the wood for a tea...then he says him, he has to get out of here..... THE END A long stupid movie..... "},{"Title":"Eh..

I could see where the film makers were coming from and that they were trying to express the fact that the two sides in this battle weren't a whole lot different from one another, that the individuals were getting lost in the fighting, etc, etc. (well, that's my presumption, anyway =^_^=)At any rate.. the movie kind of bored me.  I've watched a lot of really long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on.. basically because I just couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters.  I just kept thinking.. who cares???  I also found the acting to be rather dead pan and the dialogue strained.  I understand that this was the 1800s and all, but most of the conversations just seemed rather unnatural.  No one seemed to have any emotion throughout most of the film except during melodramatic events.The romance in the story didn't seem to be supported by anything other than I'm a guy and you're a girl, which I don't consider much of a romance, and yet I felt I was being steered to the belief that these people were in love.  Oh well.. I guess it's the whole all this horror around us, we have each other to cling to type thing, or whatever.  I was also hoping for some sort of dynamic between the two best friends (who both initially seemed to have an interest in the girl) but that was just sort of dropped. Maybe avoiding a cliche love triangle.  I don't know.Oh well.. Daniel Holt was about the only character I really truly liked. And Sue Lee was all right.  I didn't exactly dislike Jake, but he seemed a bit too... spineless, I guess.  Jack Bull I did not care for at all.  And I'm pretty sure you're *supposed* to hate just about everyone else, with the exception of the poor normal people who just get mowed down left and right. It was pretty graphic and had that whole the horrors of war thing down, but I've seen plenty of other movies with the same theme, done better. (I enjoyed The Patriot a lot, for instance, even if it was a bit emotionally manipulative)  But, as I've already stated, I'm a cynic.

Missouri never withdrew from the Union and the Union Army was not an invading force. The Southerners fought for State's Rights the right to own slaves, elect crooked legislatures and judges, and employ a political spoils system. There's nothing noble in that. The Missourians could have easily traveled east and joined the Confederate Army.It seems to me that the story has nothing to do with ambiguity. When Jake leaves the Bushwhackers, it's not because he saw error in his way, he certainly doesn't give himself over to the virtue of the cause of abolition.

From there the movie plods along with characters killing and being killed, who we don't care about one way or the other. It's too long, too redundant, and tries to accomplish way too much.

On the other hand, I wish more American Civil War movies were MERELY two hours long.  Gone with the Wind, Gettysburg - that's about the length I've come to expect; although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted; and even Gettysburg lasted as long as it did because things HAPPENED in the course of it.By contrast Ang Lee's film is bloated and uneventful.  It actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours.  That wasn't a compliment.  It's really no different to any other form of sensory deprivation at the time it feels as though it will never end, afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all.The film gets off on the wrong foot, as Lee plays his interminable credits OVER the opening footage (bad mistake) in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to loathe.  The central two are Jake, the son of German immigrants who are staunch supporters of Lincoln, and Jack, an equally staunch Southerner whose values Jake shares.  (I had to re-read that sentence to make sure I hadn't written Jack instead of Jake at some point or vice versa.)  The two go off to become bushwhackers - Southern militia who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can't even be bothered to join the official Southern army, which I presume they think is for sissies.  I'm afraid Lee lost me right there.  It's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them, or feel as if we know them in some way, then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more.  Not so here.  We aren't properly introduced to Jake for at least an hour; when we are, it becomes clear he's a gormless pimple of a man, who isn't a confederate by choice so much as by habit - the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does, whose psychology is purely immitative.  The people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way.  I found myself cheering whenever the Northern cavalry appeared on the screen.  I thought good - kill the rebels, end the damned war, let me go home.Aggravating this problem is the horrible, horrible dialogue.  Everyone speaks in the same whining Southern accent.  I've heard accents from all over the English-speaking world and this is the worst of them all.  I don't care if Southerners really did talk like that, it's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours.  And believe me, we do listen to it for the full two hours Lee's picture is a talky one, largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their ungrammatical, say-everything-three-times, folksy drawl.  It would help if they talked faster, but not much.  Can't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate?In short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life, who talk in an offensively ugly mode of speech, who don't bathe often enough, to whom nothing of interest happens, despite their being involved in a war.  Good points?  Jewel was nice to look at, and so was the scenery.  But I have complaints even here.  The cinematography, nicely framed, looked as if someone had susbtituted colour film for black and white by mistake; and as for Jewel, we were teased with her body, but never actually allowed to gaze upon it, which I think is the least we were owed.

The filmmakers put in much work to ensure that it was as historically accurate as possible. And on this end they did a wonderful job. Yet as a viewer of the film, with limited knowledge of Civil War history, many of the details seem false. Yes, there were black men who fought on the side of the South. It is true that there were many, intelligent, courageous, even good men who fought for the South as well. However, true these things are, my 21st century mind had difficulties believing them.It goes against the grain of traditional Hollywood war, or even action, pictures. Our main characters are fighting on the losing, and wrong side. (Yes, there were many other factors contributing to the Civil War besides slavery, but this film does not get into them, and so neither shall my review.) We watch these characters commit many atrocities, including the murder of innocent people. Yet it also shows soldiers from the North commit similar atrocities. It seems more a film depicting the horrendous actions of coming-of-age men than any real declaration on the themes of the war itself.There have been great movies made from the perspective of the wrong. These films show how even soldiers fighting on the wrong side of a war are still human. They have families, loved ones, hopes and dreams. If done well this type of film can show us the humanity in each person, and the atrocities of war. Yet in Ride with the Devil I never learned to care about any character. With few exceptions, the men we watch in this movie, are not sympathetic. Even the few with redeemable qualities are not given the space for us to care about their lives.The story centers on a small community within the grand scale of the war. It takes place in Missouri, where literally brother fought against brother on both sides of the battle. Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) play friends who run off to join a gang of outlaws fighting on the side of the South. Here they meet George Clyde (Simon Baker) and a black man named Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright). Holt's reasons for fighting for the slave minded are only slightly revealed toward the end. Yet it is his relationship with the other three men that make up the central theme of the film. As each of these characters learns to trust and care for Holt, they must question the sense in fighting a war bent on keeping his fellow brothers enslaved. It is to Ang Lee's credit that he uses subtle hints to follow this theme rather than pounding it in with a sledge hammer. The characters change, and evolve, but in slow, slight movement that resemble real life rather than movie life. For even at the end of the pictures no one has made new resolves with life, or changed their beliefs drastically.The action sequences, though well directed, still fall flat. Lee is unable to stir any real emotion out of the war's central motives or the intensity of its loss. It is when Lee focuses his attention of the relationships between his characters that this film succeeds. This is not surpassing when considering Lee's earlier films were small films focused on familial relationships. The bonds that grow between Roedel and Holt are moving. The love story between Sue Lee Shelley (a surprisingly good Jewel) and her suitors (to give names would be to give too much plot away) is also a treat. In Lee's next picture, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, he found a way to entwine both beautiful action sequences and smaller, meaningful exchanges of love. Here, he seems to be still growing into this ability.For Civil War buffs this film offers a reliable package of history. For the rest of us, it is a well made film that ultimately doesn't generate enough interest to really care.

But aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie. Perhaps it was a political statement? That war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence? If that was the point it was done quite well, but I don't think that was the point. I think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here, but as far as I was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot.
