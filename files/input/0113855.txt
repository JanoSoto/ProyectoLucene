[{"Title":"Street Fighter Correction","Date":"22 September 2003","Score":"84 out of 89 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Following up the spectacular disaster of competing fighting game turned movie, Mortal Kombat succeeded where Street Fighter failed.  Not a fantastic movie nor one that goes in my top ten, but Mortal Kombat (without a doubt) is one of the better game-based-films.MK wisely avoids inventing plot in unwelcomed places and sticks to the game as frequently as it can get away with.  Actually the biggest contradiction that comes to mind is Scorpion and Sub-zero on the same team.  Die hard fans will call the screenwriter on this, the rest of us won't care.All the mistakes Street Fighter made, MK avoided.  Instead of colorful campy cameo-fest, Mortal Kombat comes across as a dark tale about a handful of martial artists shot with an exaggerated epic style with humorous undertones to provide comic relief every now and again.  Then again, it is ironic that Street Fighter would feel cartoony and Mortal Kombat more concrete when looking at the style of the games (drawn sprites versus live actors).  MK is a little silly when reproducing game effects and trademark moves, though now more and more films are moving in that direction (Matrix, anyone?)The movie's premise is the first Mortal Kombat arcade game featuring a few plot hints (journey to Outworld) and a few characters from Mortal Kombat 2 (Kitana, Jax, a youthful Shang Tsung.)Christopher Lambert and Cary-Hiroyuki Takawa make the most memorable impact as Thunder God Rayden and Shape-shifting Sorcerer Shang Tsung.  Both ham up their performances just enough to remind us that we're watching a live-action video game, but they don't go overboard into Street Fighter's territory.  The rest of the cast plays their part straight forward and makes their characters believable.It's a quick and slick film, gets to the action and gets over with before you can ask too many questions.  It's a pretty decent martial arts film, and an outstanding &#145;video game' film.  And in 1995, it was the best game-inspired film you could find.  Today it's still in the top five.

This time, however, the stakes are even higher, as the outcome of the tournament will determine the fate of the Earth.Believe it or not, this is the first time I've seen this film, and I've not yet had experience with any of the games, the other films, the animated series, the lunchboxes, or anything else related to the Mortal Kombat universe. After watching the first film, however, I definitely will seek out some of the other material, as I enjoyed the film quite a bit--it earns an 8 out of 10 from me. At this point, however, I can't compare it to any other instantiations of Mortal Kombat.The film is basically a combination of a classic Hong Kong-styled martial arts actioner and a fantasy that leans slightly to the horror side of that genre. To the film's benefit, it's also not something that either director Paul W.S. Anderson or writer Kevin Droney take too seriously--the film is ultimately an adaptation of a popular video game, after all. There is a tongue-in-cheek, slightly campy sense of humor and playful cheesiness throughout the film, the humor being primarily fueled from two characters, Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) and Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert). True, Lambert has a kind of almost smarmy campiness to anything he says or does, in any film, but for me, that's part of his attractiveness--it's a large part of what sold me on the Highlander films.The fantasy aspect was something I didn't expect before watching the film. It was a very pleasant surprise. Being a huge horror fan, I was especially taken with the set design. The fantasy characters, such as Goro, and the fantasy traits of other characters, were well done and even subtle at times.As for the fights, which are the propelling force behind the film, they're pleasantly varied and well choreographed, although having just watched Master of the Flying Guillotine (1975) again recently, I was slightly disappointed that the fights weren't more brutal and gory (and in fact, this is one of the areas where I subtracted a point). But they almost make up for the lack of violence but their imaginativeness, especially the fights with Sub-Zero and The Scorpion. That cleverness was required over brawn in most instances was also a nice touch.Overall, this is a great film that any fans of martial arts or fantasy films should enjoy.

But Warner don't seem to understand what a goldmine they're sitting on when it comes to Mortal Kombat. The franchise has so many characters, complex back-stories, and mythology that it honestly dwarfs the X-Men. There is a huge amount of potential in Mortal Kombat. This juvenile 1995 effort only scratches the surface of that potential, but still manages to be an enjoyable no-brainer.I remember when this was released back in October 1995. It had been No. 1 at the US box office for three straight weeks. The audience did actually manage to go along with the silly, tongue-in-cheek hokum, and it worked. By modern standards this film is laughably awful. The CGI effects look like they were rendered on a Commodore 64, even when the technology to make much better was readily available at the time. I feel so old thinking about how dated and retro Mortal Kombat is.A bunch of muscular tough-guys are called to an exotic island to take part in a fighting tournament that could decide the fate of the planet. The Outworld Emperor wants Earth as his new dominion and is one tournament away from victory. His mortal, demonic minions, led by the brilliantly over-the-top Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa as dark sorcerer Shang Tsung, must fight Earth's toughest warriors. All but three are expendable Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade. The film follows them as they fight their way through many colorful environments.It looks and feels very much like an old-fashioned kung-fu movie. The production design is frequently wonderful, and there's hardly any unlikeable characters. Even 4-armed Prince Goro (brought to life by lovely puppetry) is fun to watch. The story however is paper-thin. Like I said, it could be so much more but the talent or motivation to make such a film in 1995 just wasn't there.I've never been a fan of Paul Anderson (as a matter-of-fact, he's one of the worst filmmakers currently working), but his US debut is a fun, little pot-boiler with some funky 90s techno.

The characters from the game series make appearances. Some of these include Kano, Sonya, Rayden, Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, and Goro.2. Scorpion has his iconic Get over here! accompanied by the blades that stick out from his hands.3. Each character for the most part have relatively similar backgrounds when it comes to the movie and the game.4. MK theme was present in a few fight scenes. The kick-ass theme song that sticks in your head was used in the opening credits and the closing ones.5. Three words Johnny Cage's nutshots.Differences 1. Little to no, and I mean NO, fatalities are present in the movie. There is a lot of MK-like action throughout but the one thing that truly made the games awesome is completely left out. To fill you in if you haven't played the games, fatalities are pretty much an attempt (and success) at you being able to brutally murder your opponent in as gruesome style as possible.2. No blood. I understand that New Line is trying to make the movie more appealing to wide varieties of audiences, but Mortal Kombat without blood isn't Mortal Kombat. This is probably the reason why no fatalities are involved.Pros 1. The movie has some damn good action scenes in it. They were simply entertaining to watch and each fight didn't drag out for a long excessive period of time.2. The acting wasn't mediocre like I believed it would be. Like so many other game-to-movie crossovers the major appeal is to display the perception of how games should be made. I put 'should' in quotes because it fails most of the time, but Mortal Kombat managed to put all of that behind it and made a pretty good movie.3. Paul W.S. Anderson. Again he has managed to do an awesome job with these video game adaptations. Although it was after, his best work I believe was with the Resident Evil movie seven years later. Personally, I think he's best when it comes to adapting, which is a rare cause when it comes to these types of movies. For example Uwe Boll. Worst director of all time and he always managed to ruin some pretty good games (House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Postal).Cons 1. The CGI. Oh my lord was this film's CGI terrible. I mean it was just simply AWFUL. Goro looked like it was animated by a first grader. The visual scenery is great and all the money probably went towards making that aspect look real but they completely ignored this very one distracting aspect.2. The costumes weren't bad, but they weren't as good as I would have expected. I like how Reptile was a ninja, but Rayden doesn't look anything like he does in the games. An argument can be made that he was in mortal form during the video games to compete in the tournament so that's why they look so differently, but I object to that because he looks just so ridiculous.3. Like I stated before, no blood is present. It's understandable that the attempt was made to make it PG-13 and all but if this could be remade with more blood...a lot more blood, then it could be made better. That's not something I would usually say, but hey, it's Mortal Kombat, and Mortal Kombat is all about brutality.Despite the cons and differences it doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable to watch. It's all around pretty good, could have been better, but I'm still fine by what I received.

And it was definitely worth the wait; I saw it a total of 13 times, which stood as my all-time record for nearly four and a half years. When all was said and done, it had grossed a strong $70 million domestically, plus $100 million worldwide.I'm not a Mortal Kombat fanatic anymore, but in retrospect MK was one of the most entertaining movies of the 1990s. It was easily the first video game-turned-movie to contain a halfway decent plot, exciting special effects, good acting and spectacular martial arts action, the latter which was before all the present-day Crouching Tiger wire-work nonsense. The actors underwent a three-month crash course in martial arts training, and their hard work paid off beautifully. On screen, they looked like they were really performing those moves instead of just imitating them. Unlike previous video game movie washouts like Double Dragon and Street Fighter, MK also had a comprehensible plot that remained faithful to the games, and in the end won a space in gamers' hearts.Along with the supporting cast of well-renowned martial artists, MK featured a nice cache of actors Linden Ashby &#150; whose screen personalities have all had a bit of a humorous smartass element to them &#150; was perfect as Johnny Cage, likewise then-rising star Bridgette Wilson as Sonya Blade and Robin Shou as the film's centerpiece, Liu Kang. Christopher Lambert gave a witty performance as thunder god Raiden (constantly misspelled as  Rayden, much to the aggravation of many MK fans like myself), and nobody cared that he was a French actor playing a Japanese character. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who recently starred in Tim Burton's version of Planet of the Apes, clearly had a ball playing the evil Shang Tsung, and it showed. (Heck, how many evil sorcerers get to wear cool black leather jackets?)Unfortunately, save for Tagawa and Wilson, MK unfortunately did not spell the worldwide exposure that many had predicted would come to the stars following the film's success, and the art of animatronics, used here to bring the four-armed Goro to life, is all but extinct in this day and age, but there was no denying that back in the day, the cast and filmmakers knew they had made an entertaining movie. While I hardly watch MK anymore, the bottom line is that it was undeniably a kick in the pants during its time, and for that reason alone it continues to maintain my highest vote to this day. 10/10  "}{"Title":"Best video game adaption movie.","Date":"30 November 2012","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" This movie certainly did not disappoint me at all.

Did they not realize when they wrote this movie that if they strayed from the storyline at all it would flop?? Well I guess not. Lui Kang (Robin Shou) was a student at the Shaolin Temple, so why did they write it so that he left? They felt there was another movie needed to suggest that you cannot fight your destiny? Give me a break!Straight away we see Lui Kang's brother, Chan Kang (Steven Ho), being killed by Shang Tsung (Hiroyuki Tagawa) at the Shaolin Temple. There is a definite problem with this. Did Lui Kang have a brother at all??. Where was Kung Lao during all this? Kung Lao is the last descendant of the one who fought in the first Mortal Kombat and won, his name sake. Did they study the history at all? The introduction to this movie would have been one hundred times better if they looked into the history of this game. It would have been so much better having Lui Kang as a devoted student of the Shaolin Temple and Shang Tsung carried into the temple on a pagoda and Goro behind him completely covered and hidden by a cloak.Making a prequel to this would have blown away the majority of the fans of Mortal Kombat. It would have also brought in much more money. I have no idea what possessed the people who produced this movie to let it out in the condition that they did. It should have been left on the cutting room floor.Okay. I have said enough about the storyline. But that is not where it stops going down hill. The settings looked completely fake and was sadly lacking in atmosphere. The settings look like painted cardboard plastered onto the structure pulled together to make the setting with no form what so ever. I expected the walls to cave in whenever there was a fight scene. When the camera zoomed out as they climbed up the staircase when they first arrived at Shang Tsung's Island, it looked like it belonged in Krull. Now Krull isn't a bad movie, for what it was. But let's face it. MK was made 20 years later. Hence the comparison. The sets and scenery should have been 20 years to the better. Not 20 years behind. As for the atmosphere, it felt like a pirates' den rather than the island of a great sorcerer in another realm.The fight scenes; where do I start? Robin Shou took part as one of the fight choreographers. Unfortunately this does not save the movie. There seems to be no natural flow in any of the fight scenes and how they repeatedly jump off the walls is over the top. Laughter passes my lips every now and then.When I first saw this movie in the cinema I had high hopes, but the more I watched it the worse it became. Characters were left out, they mixed one and two and there was very little of the background stories for any of the characters. I do have a complement to give however. The casting was spot on. Robin Shou as Lui Kang, Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Tsung, Linden Ashby as Johnny Cage, Brigette Wilson as Sonya Blade and Christopher Lambert as Lord Rayden did an exemplary job at playing their part. They were believable and easy to follow with no complexity or hesitations. The dialogue was well written also, with both comical and storyline based scenes.A hand full of people on a leaky boat are going to save the world?, Brigette Wilson. Exactly!, Christopher Lambert. A wonderfully delivered and written scene. Unfortunately there are times where the dialogue is melo-dramatic, mainly Shang Tsung's one liners. It has begun. and Your soul is mine! although delivered well are too melo-dramatic and are two of only 3 or 4 lines which were taken from the game at all.There were a lot of games made for this series. If they played their cards right they could have made several great movies all following the rich history and storyline created by the game makers, and brought in more money and provided a better level of entertainment. After all if they don't provide us with entertainment they don't get our money. I am very disappointed with this movie and I will not be viewing the third installment to this disaster.

I was only five years old at the time! Back then it was a fantastic film, and in 2015, it's still a great film! Maybe it's nostalgia, but on the other hand compared to all the other overrated junk of 2014 and 2015, I consider this movie excellent and it is one of my favorites. This film and franchise even encouraged me to study martial arts for almost 15 years now.Mortal Kombat, simply put, is a movie rendition of the original Mortal Kombat arcade video game. It's about a group of warriors from Earth who compete in an ancient martial arts tournament for the fate of the world. In more than one way, it borrows many concepts/ideas from Enter the Dragon, but on the other hand, it has it's own unique twist and storyline to it.Everything about this movie is awesome. Simple storyline with humor in the right spots, great casting, EXCELLENT choreography, and a fun soundtrack that still rocks today. In particular, this is one of my favorite fighting movies because the fights were excellently choreographed. Some standoffs between characters were extremely convincing and fun to watch. The fights were very dirty and not too over-the- top. They also paid homage to the video game with cool fatalities and even a funny friendship scene. Probably the ONLY weak spot in the film would maybe be some of the CGI (especially for Reptile); Reptile didn't look great in 1995 and the movie aging 20 years has not helped! With that being said, the non-CGI Goro looks better than any junk they would probably try to make today. It makes me very sad that the franchise (as far as the big screen goes) is in limbo. But at least we have this great classic filmed by Paul Anderson! If you enjoy video game films, martial arts, or the new age MK video games, I recommend you check this film out.

When the film was being advertised, several people were either excited for it, or skeptical due to Street Fighter being a total stinker, and since the film was rated PG-13, which meant the violence and gore from the game had to be toned down to appeal to the then-young MK fan base. Thankfully, all expectations were surpassed as Mortal Kombat actually turned out to be, believe it or not, a good video game movie. Upon its release, the film was, surprisingly, a box- office success, making it the first video game adaptation to be successful both financially, and with fans, despite mixed reviews from critics (although Gene Siskel gave the movie a thumbs up). To this day, it is considered one of the better game to film translations. Now, it's time to find out why that is the case.The film succeeds by sticking to the plot of the first game while incorporating elements from Mortal Kombat II. The plot itself is very similar to Enter the Dragon (which I consider to be the greatest Martial Arts film ever made), but with a supernatural twist to it, which is rather refreshing, and helps it stand on its own. Unlike Street Fighter where the focus was on Guile instead of Ryu and Ken (the original protagonists of that franchise), this movie centers mostly around the Mortal Kombat game's original protagonist; Liu Kang.All of the characters from the first Mortal Kombat game (as well as a few from MKII) are present in the film, and are given appropriate development, and screen time. The casting is also spot-on. This is one of the few adaptations of a video game, comic book, and cartoon show (at least one of the few I could think of) where all of the actors are cast perfectly. Christopher Lambert, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are especially great as Rayden and Shang Tsung (respectively), they deliver the right amount of charisma without chewing the scenery. Linden Ashby also plays a great Johnny Cage since he brings the character's cocky personality to life, and delivers some of the best humor in this movie. But my favorite casting choice in the film has to be Robin Shou as Liu Kang. Not only is Liu my favorite character in the games, but Shou looks very much like the character, and makes you feel for him by showing his impulsiveness, and guilt over the death of his brother. It's a shame he didn't receive more starring vehicles after this movie, because I feel he is a capable actor, and Martial Artist. He definitely has more of a personality than Steven Seagal.While the movie is rated PG-13, and doesn't contain the large amounts of gore from the game, it does make up for this area with the large amounts of Martial Arts action. The fight scenes are very well done, and often emulate more of the Hong Kong style of fight choreography, which was a refreshing change from most American action films prior to this. They also incorporate several of the special moves from the game, such as Liu Kang's bicycle kick, Scorpion's spear that comes out of his hand, etc., and they manage to make them look believable, and not embarrassing, unlike Street Fighter.The person who directed this movie is Paul W.S. Anderson, and if that name sounds familiar, that's because this is the same man who would later go on to butcher Alien vs. Predator, and the Resident Evil movies. Despite his more recent efforts, he does a solid job directing this film. One of the strong points of his direction (aside from how well he filmed the fight scenes) is how he handled the movie on a technical, and design level. The cinematography, set designs, and lighting are stylish, and keep in touch with the game's dark, and mystical atmosphere. The special FX in the movie are also pretty cool, granted, they aren't exactly Terminator 2, or Jurassic Park, but they work fine for a film released in 1995. Though not everything is CGI, the character of Goro is a puppet, which still looks good to this day, and was created by special FX masters Alec Gillis, and Tom Woodruff, Jr., Overall, Mortal Kombat is still a fun film to watch. It made up greatly for Street Fighter, and in my opinion, it still is one of the best video game movies (right up there with Street Fighter Assassin's Fist). It may not be Oscar winning material, but it is one of my personal favorite movies, and as a huge fighting game fan, I couldn't be any more proud of it.

In all honesty, it's a solid action flick, and stays focused on its source material. Perhaps it's boosted by the sea of terrible video game-to-film adaptations that were coming out around the same time. I mean, when you compare it to the live-action Street Fighter*, Double Dragon, and Super Mario Bros. films that came out in the mid-90's, it easily accomplishes what they failed to do (and failed badly at that). The Good coherent story, keeps you entertained, great actions scenes, stays faithful to the material, kick ass soundtrack.The bad Not the strongest dialog, some characters not utilized properly.My only major complaint with Mortal Kombat is that certain fight sequences could have definitely been better, and could have shown off the characters better as well. Sub-Zero and Goro don't really get strong fights, Rayden doesn't get a fight at all, and they're all MK favorites. However, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Lui Kang, Reptile, and Shang Tsung all have solid outings. I think they're worth the price of admission alone.If you're a fan of the series, it's definitely worth a viewing. *If you're looking for a good Street Fighter film, check out the anime Street Fighter II.

Mortal Kombat gave to players of the game a thrill they could not only understand but go along with. I found that after watching this movie I remembered specific details from the game I never thought of. First off, the action. Watching fighting like this, in a time pre-Matrix to life, gave me a want to be these characters. I don't know about you, but this was one of the last great films that I wanted to be a character from. For me it was Johnny Cage, others have different opinions on fighter choice.Anyway, back to the movie. Second comes the valiant efforts of each of the actors. Particularly on the side of Linden Ashby, it's a crying shame you don't see this guy in action films these days. He is an untapped resource. Next comes the ever great, fighter not actor, Robin Shou. He has a humbleness to himself that not everyone can achieve, sort of a Bruce Lee of today. Bridgette Wilson also starred in this fine adaptation and brought not only impervious beauty, but also a dramatic sense. Her quest for revenge made for a great character history, as with Shou. Then comes Christopher Lambert to play the ever shocking, forgive the pun, Lord Raiden. Though he never fought a single true battle, he didn't have to. I felt satisfied to see that not everyone was out to prove something.Finally comes the expert directing. I don't care what anyone says, Paul Anderson is a genius when it comes to adaptations, aka Resident Evil, especially video game adaptations, and here's why He plays these games like all of us who go out to see these films, whereby he knows what is to be expected.

Sounds already like great thing to do a movie adaptation of. With the tenth MK game (titled Mortal Kombat X) out fairly recently and the series still going strong after so many years, lets have a dig into the past...So, here you have the first of two Mortal Kombat movies which basically is doing your tournament story consisting of a handful chosen warriors representing planet Earth (or Earthrealm) against the bad Netherrealm guys who want to conquer. The tournament itself loses its meaning faster than you can say Finish him! as there seem to be no rules to the fights and no bracket whatsoever so it's essentially pointless, but considering that it's still somewhat entertaining and, as one would expect, just an excuse to pile up fights, it's still passable for a f*ck yeah! popcorn action flick.From what it is adapting from, the MK movie actually does a good job at keeping things in perspective. Obviously, it doesn't try to cover all the characters of the game which number by that time already was large enough for at least five movies. So it strips down the roster to more or less what is actually needed, with a few throw-away and/or who da heck are you!? characters here an there, but that's still considerably forgivable. What is also a plus is that they stayed fairly true to their characters, with Johnny Cage being the cocky Hollywood-star, Kano the bad guy with the mechanic eye which received some overhauls for the better, the monk Liu Kang, Princess Kitana, Prince Goro and so on... they all look and feel spot-on and it actually does work for the movie. The setting and backgrounds are great too.Now on to the biggest thing about Mortal Kombat the fights. Obviously the biggest gripe here is that it was aiming for the PG-13 rating whereas the games were way beyond brutal for their time. While the movie has fatalities, which the games are most (in)famous for, they are toned down considerably. You won't see ridiculous amounts of blood or any gore. The fights themselves are pretty good with decent martial arts and performances, albeit a few of them are underwhelming to say the least (such as Liu Kang vs Kitana and vs Sub-Zero...). A personal highlight for me was the Johnny Cage Vs Scorpion fight which has some bad-ass stunts and stages it takes place in, with awesome lightening, camera angles and fast-paced all out martial arts action. Its a good thing they didn't overdo them with hectic camera-cuts and you get a decent grasp what is actually going on in the fight. Kudos to the director. Definitely the best part of the movie.Generally the mood of the movie is something in between fantasy and cheesy Hollywood martial arts action, it's never aiming for the more grittier and morbid tones, something that at least the first two games had to a degree. It's never going to shock or disturb you, which might really disappoint true hardcore fans of the franchise.All in all, Mortal Kombat is still entertaining if you know what to expect. Sure, it's stupid and silly, but you wouldn't really expect Shakespeare here. It does a competent job at what it tries to achieve enjoyable action that's best enjoyed with your brain turned off. It is like your typical Michael Bay flick only better executed and self-aware even though not without a good punch of cheesiness. As far as video-game adaptations go, this one is still holds up and is surprisingly not bad while somewhat true to the games, even though in a family-friendly way.Or the tl;dr version if you want *uppercut hit sound* Test your might!

Then again, after crap like Super Mario Bros. and Street Fighter, my expectations were very low, but whatever.The first thing you notice is that someone actually paid attention to the games. While there were a few errors (such as Sub-Zero and Scorpion being on the same side), the movie at least tried to follow the game's plot. Unlike Super Mario Bros, it didn't take the whole story into a pointless direction, and unlike Street Fighter, it didn't use a bunch of lousy special effects that had nothing to do with what was going on.Second, the acting was pretty good. While nowhere near Oscar-winning, the actors at least sound like what you would imagine the characters to sound like (except for Kano; whoever played him can go to hell). Special points go to the actors who played Raiden and Shang Tsung; both were very well done, and added to the mysterious atmosphere of the two. The fight scenes, while not all THAT great, were at least partly decent (then again, I wasn't expecting Bruce Lee here).Now for the bad. The plot was at least passable, but they killed major characters much too quickly. The fight with Kano, for example, was barely thirty minutes into the movie, and he gets killed before he even had a role. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero's deaths are shortly before and after that, respectably. We never learn much about the characters, and while the games could get away with that oversight, a movie can't. Also, some fight scenes were very badly done (especially the aforementioned Kano fight), and the fight with Goro was very anti-climatic, if you ask me.Still, at least check this one out once.

Lambert, ugh) and screenplay make it just too big of a problem to overcome.  Since I am comparing this movie to other movies of its genre a rating of 7 out of 10 was given.

I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great action/martial arts film that has a decent storyline combined with spectacular effects and martial arts. "},{"Title":"Quite possibly the greatest Hollywood adaptation of a video game to date.","Date":"6 February 2010","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" The plot of Mortal Kombat is almost completely identical to the plot of every American martial arts movie made in the 90s&#x97;a demonic warlord from another dimension is planning to conquer earth and only three heroes have any chance of stopping him by defeating his chosen warriors in a tournament of the elder gods. To be perfectly frank, the plot is almost inconsequential; Mortal Kombat is an action movie out and out, one which doesn't disappoint. The production, soundtrack, and action are all first rate and the special effects rate favorably for that of a film produced in 1995. Mortal Kombat makes only one promise and on this it delivers viewers expecting a first rate martial arts action extravaganza will be more than satisfied with what it has to offer.I was extremely impressed with this film's choreography, in particular the stunt work of leading man Robin Shou as the heroic Liu Kang. For reasons unclear to me, Shou's is not a name well known in Hollywood action circles. I assert that the physical performance he delivers in this film rivals any by Hong Kong greats Donnie Yen, Chow Yun Fat, or even Jet Li. Further, if one is to compare his martial arts prowess to that of his American martial arts star contemporaries, he stands on even higher ground. Certainly, the very ability to lift his leg high enough to throw a sidekick outdoes any physical feat ever performed on screen by Steven Seagal, the poor man's Van Damme.On the subject of Van Damme, one of the main characters from the video game on which this film was based was in turn based on Van Damme's portrayal of martial arts shyster Frank Dux in Bloodsport. The most vainglorious of the heroic trio, Johnny Cage is played with beautiful yuppie poise by Linden Ashby. Ashby is tremendous here, reveling in the shortcomings of his character. Rather than try to recreate Cage in the mold of an iron jawed John Wayne-Clint Eastwood hybrid, he instead has fun with the role, portraying the character as a pampered mountebank. Draped in excessive luggage and designer sunglasses, Ashby is convincing as a Hollywood hipster trying to be taken seriously. He is handsome, posh, and unapologetically narcissistic. I didn't buy the romance between the metrosexual Cage and the icy Sonya Blade for one moment; it felt tacked on and seemed to fly in the face of all common sense. But really, this is the smallest of complaints.Heroes can only look heroic if they are matched on screen by adequate foils. There are no shortage of villains in this film, several of whom are either enhanced by or comprised solely of special effects animation. On the more human side of villainy, Trevor Goddard delivers a fine performance as the ill mannered henchman Kano. Here is a man who eats with his hands, doesn't think twice about hitting a woman, and makes no effort to disguise the pleasure he takes in human suffering. I enjoyed Goddard's performance as the brutish Kano almost as much as Cary-Hiroykui Togawa's brilliant performance as the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung. Tsung is the right hand man of the evil emperor Shou Kahn and his personal enforcer&#x97;the four armed, eight foot tall, half man-half dragon Prince Goro&#x97;is the reigning champion of the tournament. A fine martial artist in his own right, Togawa delivers the film's most memorable one liners ad nauseam, including in no particular order of importance Finish him! Flawless victory, and of course, the spellbinding Your soul...is mine! Togawa nonchalantly oozes evil, stealing every scene with understated delivery.Rounding out the supporting cast, the heroes are guided on their quest by earth's sworn protector, the lightning god Rayden (Christopher Lambert). It was a pleasure seeing Lambert on screen again in an action movie. Already known for his stoic deliveries, he seems to take his cues in this film from Togawa, commanding fear and respect without so much as lifting a finger. Credit director Paul W.S. Anderson for understanding that the truly powerful need not posture endlessly.The women of Mortal Kombat are few and far between and, quite frankly, look a little out of place on screen standing beside real martial artists. Still, they are both very beautiful and deliver adequate, if not outstanding, performances. Bridgette Wilson, perhaps better known today as the wife of tennis great Pete Sampras, portrays the cagey, hardened Special Forces Lieutenant Sonya Blade with an aloof inclemency. Fiercely independent, Blade is on a mission of vengeance, seemingly willing to follow Kano to hell and back to avenge the murder of her partner. As attractive as Wilson is, she is upstaged by the absolutely breathtaking Talisa Soto. Soto is a visual feast as Princess Kitana, the renegade step daughter of the evil emperor Shou Kahn. You get the sense Kitana was thrown in to the script more for the sake of eye candy than necessity to the plot, and to this end, the contrivance works quite well. Mortal Kombat is an extremely good looking movie in more ways than one.I already mentioned my dissatisfaction with the subplot of hinted romance between Cage and Blade, but let me take this time to mention how displeased I was regarding the general lack of character development of Blade. We at least see the death of Kang's brother on screen, and everywhere Cage goes, his underwhelming reception as a legitimate martial artist reaches hyperbolic proportions. (Note that this movie predates the popularization of the UFC; an action star wouldn't have to travel far these days to convince people he's the real deal.) Blade however is simply not given adequate screen time to explain why she is driven, vengeful, and independent to the point of being obstinate. Still, these are character discrepancies I am willing to forgive in a film as otherwise outstanding as Mortal Kombat.

Many movies seem to struggle with a story they cannot hold onto nor do some movies seem to understand what exactly do they want to present to audiences.In 'Mortal Kombat', the guys behind it took their chance to give us movie that would hold the crown for 'best video game movie' in a long time. This movie achieves an astonishing record of that title arguably.First of all, the movie contains the same premise of its game counterpart. Try not to let 'Enter The Dragon' cross into your mind too much.You have your fighters from Earthrealm fighting against Shang Tsung and his Outworld minions. That takes place on an island.... Shang Tsung's island.... If you really wanted to see Scorpion and Sub-Zero go through their story I'm afraid you have to throw that aside. We instead follow the journey of Liu Kang, Sonya Blade and Johnny Cage in their different motivations in taking part in the tournament. It's not bad as long as the characters are cool. I think they are decent enough as protagonists. As for Raiden(Yes, not Rayden), I really like the kind of persona they embodied for him. It's not my preferred rendition of him. But I accept it.So we have some decent heroes but our villains do happen to be more entertaining. Mr. Tagawa especially embraces his role as Shang Tsung and makes up for a pretty funny villain. Kano on the other hand is another entertaining aspect of the villain household. Goro is faithfully impressive and the filmmakers did their best in bringing Goro to life at the time being. As for Reptile, the CGI is not really good as this is one thing to draw audiences back from the quality. Again I'll touch on the iconic ninjas later.Each fight that takes place has some decent choreography placed into it making it be a little authentic as all those Hong Kong martial arts movies you may have seen. Fans may be disappointed with the lack of gore and fatalities but here's the thing. The movie kind of needs to appeal to a target audience that might consist of teens. I sincerely believe they still tried to give us a bit of brutality in the fights. Look at how Scorpion is finished off or how Sub-Zero finishes that poor guard.Set-wise, it is good to look at. Although I question the inaccuracy in showing off China. It's nice they took in Thailand as their filming location. Gives the movie some visual interest. The acting is passable, it's not great as a whole but it is serviceable. I'll say that this movie still gives MK fans a good movie by diving into the lore of many MK characters. It's a bit cheesy but not to the point of me cringing.Oh yeah in regards to Scorpion and Sub-Zero, while they are cool. Ultimately they have better representations elsewhere. Both are just cannon fodder with only one line to pass them off as rivals. They are also a bit more expensive to do than other characters which is why they aren't used effectively enough. Or they need Shang Tsung to have some kind of fighting force. As a fan of these characters myself, it does kind of hurt to see a bit of mistreatment.Anywho.... The movie is still good for its fans. If it weren't for this movie then don't expect the theme song to be there and if you wonder why Kano is Australian.... Look at this movie as to why. Same with Your soul is mine.... Combining some good references from the original game along with elements of MKII and in addition to its other aspects in filmmaking, 'Mortal Kombat' displays signs that video game movies can be realised.

But to me this is one of the best American made martial arts based movies. Let me start with what I think is good.The fight scene's...The fight scene's in this movie are very well written and choreographed. The actors and stunt doubles did a great job of representing the respective martial arts displayed in this movie. One particular scene I want to point out ''Spoiler Ahead'' is Johnny Cage vs Scorpion...This was in my opinion the best fight scene in the entire movie...Surpassing even the final battle between Liu Kang and Shang Tsung. The Johnny Cage vs Scorpion fight which takes place about half way into the movie is a fight scene where the Music/Choreography and overall ambient feel come together to make this fight scene truly memorable. It really conveys how good both fighters are...Scorpion is a nearly impossible to hit specter and Johnny Cage is probably the best American Martial Artist in the movie...Both are portrayed very well in this scene.Another notable mention in this movie is the humor, Some things in this movie are actually quite funny. Rayden played by (Christopher Lambert) is quite humorous. The musical score is also well done for this movie. The music is always involving and plays a rather large role in helping portray the fight scenes.Downfalls? This movie is an early example of CGI technology. The CGI in this movie is quite obvious when it is used. CGI had already been done and done quite a bit better when this movie came out most notably by Jurassic Park. Thankfully though, all of the fighting was done by actors and stuntman. The CGI in this movie is pretty sparse and that's a good thing.In closing, I think Mortal Kombat is a great action flick and one of the few case's in which a movie based off a game is actually done quite well. If you're a fan of the game series and not a stickler for things like overly noticeable CGI or a few cheesy lines, then you might enjoy this movie.

It is one of the few video game adaptations that doesn't suck so bad you want to cry. No, it gets the job done-the right way. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed by none other than Liu Kang himself-Robin Shou. It is also very well cast and decently acted. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is fantastic as Shang Tsung, the designated 'bad guy' of the Mortal Kombat world.There's not much more I can say about this movie except that it will always be a classic in my eyes. Maybe the effects are a tad cheesy, but who cares? That just makes it all the more fun. I urge all Mortal Kombat fans to give this movie a chance-I promise, you won't regret it. The constant flow of action will keep you immersed the entire time. This one will not disappoint. "},{"Title":"It has begun!","Date":"2 May 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" Back in the 90s, I remember when the classic video game hit the markets and caused a stir. Not only did it make a huge commercial splash, but it was also quite controversial for its graphicness. I honestly never had the pleasure of playing these MK games, and in this day and age, fighting games are not my forte. But action and martial arts movies certainly are, especially when they're based on popular video games.The Mortal Kombat movie offers plenty of fun. It's got enough fight scenes to satisfy; some are short and some are pretty cheesy, but some fights hold up really well and are a blast. It's got some very old-school special effects that, even though appear gaudy by today's standards, are good in concept and design. Above all, this is a film that doesn't take itself that seriously; it's probably an important aspect for a film with such a weak story and with so many limitations. Most of the movie's flaws are forgivable given the tongue-in-cheek attitude, and altogether it's not too far off from the original video game.For better or for worse though, the story suffers tremendously. Of course, fighting games like this don't usually have a story to draw upon, so the movie does the best it can to extrapolate the characters and tournament-themed conflict into an Enter the Dragon-style plot.It works for the most part, but I find it pretty darn shallow, unoriginal, and lacking in proper immersion. Some more depth to the story, characters, or environment would probably have helped.The film shows fine photography and editing, with some interesting lighting effects. Acting is pretty hammy all around; Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is almost laughable with his facial expressions and over-zealous dialogue, and I found it hard to take Christopher Lambert seriously. But, the three main leads (Robin Shou, Linden Ashby, and Bridgette Wilson) fit their roles respectably. Writing is not terribly sophisticated at all. The production shows some limitations with its horrid CGI-graphics and some fake-looking sets and props. But, the designs are awesome and the costumes aren't bad. Music is really smashing.I'm sure this film will appeal to kids wanting something exciting and don't mind something slightly cheesy. Video game fans and folks who grew up with this movie will probably get a nostalgic kick out of it too. Otherwise, I can only recommend it as a rental.

However, if you understand the video game series and appreciate it, this is an enjoyable action/martial arts flick.The film starts off with Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, and Sonya are chosen to compete in the martial arts tournament, Mortal Kombat, by Raiden, to prevent the Outworld from winning their 10th MK tournament and conquering Earthrealm. While Liu Kang and Sonya have legitimate reasons for entering the tournament (revenge for lost brother and partner, respectively), Johnny Cage is just a selfish asshole looking to disprove media rumors of him being a fake.The characters in this movie are portrayed fairly well. As stated, Johnny Cage is a selfish asshole who fails at hitting on Sonya. This was a letdown as Johnny Cage was my favorite fighter as a kid because he wore sunglasses. Sonya is a dedicated special forces soldier who takes her job seriously. Liu Kang is a Bruce Lee clone who is sort of a dick to Johnny Cage, and seems to be the main focus of the film.The chosen actors are actually rather fitting, with the exception of Liu Kang actor Robin Shou whose hairstyle is ridiculous and looks nothing like classic Liu Kang.The film itself is incredibly cheesy and over-the-top, not unlike the video games. The violence is surprisingly low and nobody performs any fatalities with the exception of Shang Tsung. Scorpion's toasty fatality appears but fails to actually kill anyone. While it is lacking in fatalities, the characters' special moves do make appearances, such as Johnny Cage's ball breaker, Liu Kang's bicycle kick, and Sonya's legcrotchgrabstrangle.The fights are decently choreographed and look very MK-esquire complete with impossible yet hilarious-looking stunts and cheesy effects. Something I noticed is that there is an excessive amount of GRUNTING AND SCREAMING, particularly from that annoying bastard Liu Kang.You won't find any of the MK2 fighters in this film although it is certainly referenced a few times. I actually like that they stuck with the original MK cast because some of the new MK2 characters kind of sucked, and Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, and Sonya are fan favorites despite Liu Kang being infamous having the worst fatality in the series next to Stryker's stupid taser fatality.The story is present but you won't really care unless you are one of the aforementioned retards who is expecting a serious martial arts movie. MK is loaded with humor that will be enjoyed by fans, both new and old, and to be fair the whole tournament/Outworld backstory does make sense in the MK universe. I must note that the term Flawless Victory is used after like every freaking fight despite both parties sustaining a decent amount of hits. It got annoying after a while, and is proof that the script writer had never played MK in his entire life and had a very loose grasp on the English language.Overall, Mortal Kombat is an enjoyable experience for fans of the series, with its cheesy effects and story tying in perfectly with the game series. The fighting is choreographed with great consideration to the movesets in the games and the personalities of the characters, while they may be different from what our minds had to conjure up as children, are understandable and fitting. If you played MK, see it. If not, play MK dammit. "},{"Title":"Best Video game adaptation along with Silent Hill","Date":"3 April 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" I remember when I first watched this film, I was about 10 years old. Now into my mid-twenties, I had a chance to watch the film again, and it is still very enjoyable.What Video game adaptations seem to be doing wrong these days (especially fighting game/manga adaptations like DOA, SF Legend of Chun Li, and Dragonball Evolution) is that much much respect is given to its source material - often the story is twisted some other way or the actors' acting is just hilariously bad.This movie got most of the factors right in making a good video game adaptation1. Sticking to the story. This film, while directly taking the story ofMK1, incorporates the elements of MK2, and it works great. The viewer goes through on a journey into the tournament with the hero Liu Kang, as he battles several fighters such as Subzero, Reptile, ShangTsung and other unknowns. Sticking to the story of the first game is one of the biggest credits I would give to this movie. Sure the director did make some liberties (such as Scorpion and Subzero on the same side, Johnny Cage fighting Goro when in game Liu Kang defeated him etc), but the overall flow of the story still remains intact.2. Fighting is top-notch. The fights are also the highlights of this movie. In movies such as Dragonball Evolution or Legend of Chun Li, we were treated with almost no fight at all, or even if there were fights, they were below expected quality (poor). The best fights that I would pick are Johnny Cage vs Scorpion and Liu Kang vs Reptile. Other fights were okay, except I was maybe disappointed a bit with Liu Kang vs Subzero, and Liu Kang vs ShangTsung, cause I wanted those fights to be longer, and could have been choreographed better to be more epic. Another point to add to the fighting is that we see various special abilities of the characters such as Scorpion's spear with the taunt Get over here!, Subzero's ice beam, Shang Tsung's soul drain, Liu Kang's bicycle kick etc. It just makes me reminiscence about the games.3. Acting is passable. Acting is done great from Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa,he has done many villain roles in many films, but the most memorable character he played (till now) is still his ShangTsung from the MK film. Other characters' acting is passable - though I could have wished for some characters to not use cheesy lines or one-liners, but heck, this is a video game film after all, and those lines weren't that bad.The only thing which pulls this movie from being great is that cgi is a bit dated now (its been released 15 years ago!), but considering the advancement in cg technology, it is understandable.Many people still consider this film to be one of the best video game film adaptations, and I definitely agree (even with its cg setbacks/cheesy lines/some fights which could have been improved). It stands the test of time pretty well - sure it's no Oscar material, but it sets out to deliver what fans really want and whole lot more). It's such a shame that the sequel annihilation was so horrible that it took 13 years to reboot the franchise(with upcoming MK film by Warners, that is if they can get past this legal dispute with Threshold)However, the first MK film still comes on top as best video game adaptation along with Silent Hill film.**I guess this will be tested by the new Prince of Persia film, Tekken film, King of Fighters film coming out - whether these films would be better adaptations than the first MK film "},{"Title":"Brainless Beat-em-up movie that delivers only what it promises","Date":"9 January 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" In every generation, the best fighters from across the globe come together to compete in a tournament called Mortal Kombat. But whether they come for the fame, the glory, for vengeance or other reasons, Mortal Kombat serves a darker purpose as a pivotal point in a war between earth and an evil realm called Outworld. Already the out-world fighters led by the evil soul sucking sorcerer Shang Tsung and the four-armed giant Goro have won nine previous tournaments. If the fighters of earth lose this last tournament, then earth would come under the rule of the Outworld Emperor.This adaptation of the controversially violent video game series follows the adventure of Liu Kang, a man seeking his brother's killer, Johnny Cage, a washed up film star looking to boost his reputation as a fighter and Sonya Blade, a SWAT team leader with a vendetta against another Mortal Kombat participant called Kano. The unlikely trio form an uneasy friendship which develops as the film progresses. For a movie based on a game known only for its violence, the characters are given a decent amount of development. Impulsive, vengeance obsessed Liu Kang learns of a greater purpose in his life, Johnny Cage grows from selfish stuck up snob to a genuine friend willing to risk his own life for others and proud Sonya learns a lesson in humility and how to trust in her teammates. A straight out Flawless Victory goes to the awesome production design that preserves the otherworldly look of the video game but does not go overboard or end up looking cartoony. Unlike campy video game movies that came before, Mortal Kombat takes itself seriously with only some well placed humour in between all the doom and gloom. The deadpan sarcasm of Christopher Lambert's Raiden, exaggerated hamming of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's Shang Tsung and witty one liners from Linden Ashby's Johnny Cage all work well within the surreal context of this show, constantly reminding the viewer that this is, after all, a video game adaptation.Fans would be happy by how closely the movie sticks to the game in both the look and feel of the characters. Even the special moves like Cage's Shadow kick, Sub-Zero's ice blast and Liu Kang's Bicycle kick are featured. The fights are short but a sure crowd pleaser. High flying wire stunts that are over used in so many modern movies are kept to a minimum, giving each fight an unpredictable and raw style that does not look overly choreographed.Though Mortal kombat manages to toe the line without falling into campy territory, it never goes beyond its perimeter as video game adaptation. It delivers only what fans of fighting games want; good fights set to a raving heavy metal/techno soundtrack and lots of action with a paper thin excuse of a story to connect one fight to the next. In fact it is possible to just skip ahead to every battle scene, watch just those scenes, and be satisfied at the end of the day as the credits roll and that memorable Mortal Kombat theme song plays.In the unstable field of movies adapted from video games, Mortal Kombat still ranks among the best, being able to please both fans and casual movie viewers alike by being just as fun as actually playing the game. Those looking for anything deeper than superficial fighting video game fantasy would do well to look elsewhere. "},{"Title":"Nice work","Date":"23 August 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Nice work, but Mortal Kombat is not a comedy. It's a blood-thirsty video game with a lot of character driven plots, but Paul Anderson just loves to create comedies that are really drama's(for the exception of Alien vs. Predator). I like this film, but I excpected to love it not question it. Well maybe I wanted this film to be a surprise hit, where everyone would love it, and Mortal Kombat would be one of the highest grossing films ever. Critics hate this film, but what really counted in the mid 90's was the audience, not the critics, but now in the 21st century there are critics like Peter Travers, Roger Ebert, and Richard Roeper that give no hope for a movie.If Mortal Kombat came out today, no one would see it. Roger Ebert is the kind of critic that want to keep you from wasting your money on terrible films, and it works. Films like Freddy Got Fingered, Full Frontal, Charlies Angels, and my favorite film Saving Silvermen. But even with that kind of power to convince people not to see a film, we still didn't listen to him when Spider-Man came out. That film made about 400 million dollars, and to this day at least 30 percent of the 100 percent of people would still argue whether Spider-Man or Spider-Man 2 is the best. Well in the end Spider-Man 2 has made almost 370 million dollars and is probably the most critically acclaimed film of the year. And the people love that film, so I quess that's what a film needs, critical acclaime, appreciated by the audience, and become one of the highest grossing films ever.As for Mortal Kombat, what should have been the best martial arts film in the business, has turned into a B movie. To bad the sequel is probably THE WORST FILM EVER, and the third one is coming out, well sense it's not done by Paul Anderson, then I think I won't see it. I give this film ***(out of 4 stars).

But if one was to look at this like a work of art, then one may be surprised at how many meanings it has. **********************SPOILERS*************************** For starters, the basics  Great special effects, enough to be eye-candy, but not over the top CGI that is fake. The Goro statue looked cool, as did Shang Tsung's boat and Scorpion's and Sub-zero's projectile abilities. There's decent dialogue, with lines that had the theatre howling, especially Cage's lines when he looks at the 20+ opponents who were itching to beat him up and claims that they're lucky Rayden stopped the fight. And the fight scenes were top-notch, arguably the best in ANY movie, and without the invisible wire stuntwork that, while is fun to watch in controlled doses, gets incredibly boring when everyone can fly. Here's a piece of news - Francois Petit (Sub-zero) literally running on a wall and then jumping behind his opponent was real with no wires. How many films can say that? To give credit to Paul Anderson, he made a movie that fans of this game could enjoy, like Johnny's split punch and Liu's bicycle kick, but also one that people who never heard of MK could still enjoy. That's a delicate, carefully put together result, and one that was lacking from his future video game film, Resident Evil, which had all RE game fans wondering what it had to do with the game they loved. I wish the film had given its characters more dialogue to interact with each other before the fighting started, as these actors were a lot of fun to watch. But that's really the only drawback that this great movie had. Now, to analyse the fights. We have Sonya versus Kano, where she basically fights him in an even battle till the till she gets the upper hand by placing a death grip on his neck. Instead of the typical Must Be Better Than My Opponent By Sparing Him cliché, we have a heroine who kills him on the spot even though he wasn't a threat to her at that specific time. Reason for that was a good one. Kano was her equal, and she had no guarantee that he wouldn't get lucky and get the upper hand on her once released, so she had to take advantage of that scene and finish him. There's a need to deliver the killing blow when the protagonist is afraid of the antagonist's abilities. Then there's (IMO) the biggest fight of the film, that being Johnny Cage against Goro. Here was the reigning champion who's been wiping the floor with the best that Earth has to offer for nine generations. His mere appearance was probably enough to send fear and panic into the mind of many humans who saw him for the first time when he stepped into the ring to fight them. That's a crucial advantage, as an opponent who is shocked on the spot won't be able to concentrate on the battle, and Goro counted on that. And even if they weren't shocked, then of course he had no problems using his huge size advantage to quickly pummel his opponents. He had already destroyed most of the humans who arrived on Shang Tsung's boat before Cage decided to challenge him. Things didn't look good for Cage since, if he has to be more talented (via endurance, speed, technique) than his physically larger opponent to make up for the size and strength disadvantage he'll face due to an adversary who is literally twice his size, then how much more talented did this guy have to be in order to overcome Goro's incredible stature with his feet, fists and heart? But Cage knew that Goro wasn't going to be beaten in a fair fight. He'd be knocked down and he'd always get back up, and keep doing that till his attacker was eventually tired, and then move in for the brutal kill. So Cage lured him into changing the battle from the ring to the edge of the cliff by punching him in the nuts, a bait that Goro, in his overconfidence, took. Once at the edge of the cliff, Cage had the opportunity to knock him down, and then over the cliff. Thus, we have a new winner who used his brains to beat the unbeatable gladiator. Finally, we have Liu versus Shang Tsung, and Tsung thinking he was going to have an easy time besting Liu by playing on his worst fear, which was that he was a failure by letting his brother down. Initially, it seemed to work. But once Liu overcame his worst fear, Tsung wasn't prepared for that, as it had never happened so far. As a result, Tsung becomes confused, throwing blind punches that even an average fighter can block. Liu even went as far as giving Tsung a chance to surrender, something that he refused to do after defeating Reptile (stepping on the lizard-like creature as soon as it emerged from the statue). So that's how confident Liu became as soon as the tables were turned, which, granted isn't a very realistic portrayal of how someone would feel as soon as he/she faced personal fears (as someone with a phobia could face their fear and still be shaky for ages to come, not getting over it within an instant), but still an encouraging one that urges people to face their fears nonetheless. Overall, in a world that absolutely enjoys putting people down for its own benefit (reasons for that are for another discussion), things like this film are necessary on top of being enjoyable. People are told that they should give up, not fighting for what they believe in. MK, on the other hand, tells its viewers that they should never give up but fight instead, and fight nonstop, as giving up is worst than anything else. Thus, it's compelling as well as entertaining.

The narrative itself is extremely simple, with classic binary oppositions of good vs evil and regular humans vs freaks and sorcerers. It's Earthrealm vs Outworld in an adrenaline pumping tournament ripped straight out of Enter the Dragon.

Although it didn't cast any movie superstar like 'Street Fighter' (Raul Julia & J.C. Van Damme) it has other things which favor it. The characterizations were very good and to detail, as if the characters jumped from the video game to the screen. Mighty Prince Goro, for example, is a proof of the hours spent by the producers on visualizing every single detail form the game since it is a fiction character and it did not look like a creepy movie puppet. In a way this was a compensation of an unknown cast since the only known faces were Bridgette Wilson (Sonya Blade) Lindel Ashby (Johnny Cage) Christopher Lambert (Rayden) and Talissa Soto (Kitana). Secondly the environments were also something that the production set his eyes on too, nice visual effects, nice alike-to-the-game-sets which improved the graphics from the first Mortal Kombat video game wishing sometimes they could look as good as the movie, so the money that they may have spent on a super (and overpaid) cast starring Van Damme or any other traction.I mean action hero was well invested on sets and visuals. Good one! The only thing that didn't quite fit was the relationship of the characters in the movie. Yes, its script follows the main plot of the game but there are a few bloopers that worth take into consideration. Firstly, in the movie there is a polarization of forces, since there is a predictable line which divides who are the bad guys, Shan Sung, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Kano, from the good guys, Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Liu Kang who are selected to face Shang Tsung's evil forces under the command of Rayden. now this may be confusing for those people who are not familiar with the plot of the game (and confusing for some fans too) since on the arcade version plot every character has a reason of his own for participating in Mortal Kombat and there are no good or bad guys, neither they are friends. You can see Johnny Cage kicking the creeps out of Liu Kang or Rayden beating the hell out of Sonya as if they were enemies to death. (Besides who said that Rayden was a 'good guy'? Being a God does not always means you are against evil) Something else that is out of the line in the movie is the romance that held Liu Kang with Princess Kitana. First she is a character from the game 'Mortal Kombat II' so there is neither room nor a reason to show up Kitana's character in the first movie. Secondly a flashy romance is completely out of bounds in the logic of the game, no character is sentimentally linked to another in any version of Mortal Kombat, and this is just an old wasted Hollywood trick! So for some people this might be a bunch of mindless action pieces, but it is a movie based on a video game plot. Adding more character or plot development would have lead to a movie with no room in a creative field (since it is based on a video game history) nor in Mortal Kombat field itself (since an apocalyptic fighting contest is a thin history for a movie but a great plot for a video game.So considering the pros as well as the mentioned cons above I give this film a rate of 8 out of 10 it is a nice choice for fans of Mortal Kombat, as well for those who are catching up with this arcade classic and its plot, just consider the mistakes I pointed out.

Many people have ripped on it for many reasons, such as acting & script, but let's face it That's NOT why we watch movies like this! We watch these movies to see ACTION & be ENTERTAINED! I mean, Enter The Dragon had awful dialogue, eyelash-thin characters, & cardboard performances in spades, but everyone regards that as 1 of the world's greatest Martial Arts films. Think about it.Anyway, the story was really hard to follow, but it's the same way with the games; I would suggest seeing this movie only if you know the 3 games very well. I'll admit the acting (except for Ashby & Tagawa) wasn't anything special, & the effects are kinda old-fashioned by today's Matrix standards, but the fights are quite good. It's mostly just normal, one-on-one, man-to-man, hand-to-hand fighting, not 2 actors flying around on wires & dodging bullets; not that that's bad or anything!Here's what I think of the character-character fights Sonya Vs. Kano could've been so much better if it weren't so damn 1-sided; Johnny Cage Vs. Scorpion was simply superb; Liu Kang Vs. Kitana was pretty pointless; Kang Vs. Sub-Zero was good, but it should've been longer; Cage Vs. Goro was wonderful (This is where you fall down, had me laughing); Kang Vs. Reptile was the other candidate for best fight; & Kang Vs. Tsung was a little too 1-sided. Tsung didn't inflict much damage, & I sincerely doubt that Kang could defeat all those guys that Tsung unleashed. Also, I was surprised that Rayden, my favorite character, didn't fight, but it wouldn't have been fair, seeing as how he's a god!There were some touches I liked, as well Ed Boon, who does some characters' voices for the game, did the voice of Scorpion here; & when Reptile takes on human form, you can hear the game announcer say, Reptile like he does in the game! Great stuff.All in all, Mortal Kombat is no 2001 A Space Odyssey or Enter The Dragon, but it's still leagues ahead of its predecessor, the boring Street Fighter, whose only redeeming quality is Raul Julia's (unintentionally) hilarious performance. This film here is a good time-waster & entertainer; I even knew in my heart that there would definitely be a sequel. However, it could've been so much better if it had the unbridled, super-graphic violence that made the games so famous; or infamous, depending on who you ask. Other than that & a few other minor failings, an awesome movie.Those were $500 sunglasses, asshole!

Keeping very accurate to the whole mythos of the game, Mortal Kombat blends the story and elements from the first two games into one movie.  The actors and actresses who play the Kombatants are actually allowed to have a little personality and depth in between all the chop-socky, and try to make them into people you would at least root for in the movie.  The characters are at least likable in what they do and add some humor when needed.  And the two strongest fight scenes still remain a tie between Johnny Cage/Scorpion and Liu Kang/Reptile.Where the film shows it age lies in the the CG and fighting choreography. What was passable as standard CG then, doesn't look as good now, and Goro as an animatronic character is kind of laughable by today's standards.  (My favorite scene is Goro's search for Johnny Cage through the caves.  It was a dark scene for a reason, and not for mood purposes)  And I remembered the fighting being a little more dynamic than it was, but in the days of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I guess the film-goer just expects more these days.But it does retain its dignity and doesn't get overly silly for the sake of being so.  There are elements of the fight scenes which are still impressive (Robin Shou being the best of the lot), the MK techno music still adds a certain flair to the battles, some of the SFX still hold up well enough for story purposes, the game's source material was worked in without it seeming contrived, and is was decently acted.In comparison to its sequel, which was just heinously awful and ridiculous, this actually wanted to be an interesting and fun movie, and I think it was and still is.  It's not going to stand the test of time other than being a footnote of pop culture, but in the rebirth of video game based movies these days (the bland Tomb Raider and the under-appreciated and only other good game movie, in my opinion Final Fantasy), this is the only video game based film of the '90's that wasn't terrible.

Everyone should be forced to see this movie. I honestly love it, and planning to buy it on DVD. Its probably my favorite movie of all time (battling against Happy Gilmore and Mystery Men) and sad it is overlooked. I love the game, and its faith to it is very respectable. It doesnt overdramatize its material (as in say, X-Men-which was a good movie) nor does it poke fun at it (the horrendous Street Fighter) or make it boring (Wing Commander...yeah, that was a movie) and it obviously appreciates its fans, rewarding them with the little things (Johnny's Friendship; Liu Kang's bicycle kick; the awesome Scorpion fatality) and the ending is fabulous. (although I found it one of the weakest fights-the way the fight started should have been the way it ended-although the Chan thing was a nice touch) I feel it could have been a little better with Kung Lao (hes mentioned a lot) and if Sub-Zero (one of my favorites) wasn't reduced to a supporting character. Its also really funny and tongue in cheek-(almost all scenes involving Johnny Cage with-hmm, any character). Although the sequel was VERY disappointing (it destroyed the story-line and fell victim to usual Hollywood traps-not to mention Rayden, Shoa Kahn and Sub-Zero sucked) the first is the best.

Being a female fan of the video game of the same name (and some of its sequels), even with all its gratuitous violence (though I stated in another review that I despise horror films, but violence doesn't bother me if it's computer generated), I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this film.    I didn't even know if I could take it after watching the first minute after the opening dragon sequence... it sent a chill straight through me... but it turned out to be the worst violence in the film at all.  And that's all I'll say about it.       By the end, I was completely immersed and enthralled, which eventually made me into a more dedicated fan for two or three years afterward.

I must say, however, that while there couldn't have been a better choice for Liu Kang's character (sorry Jason Scott Lee, you'd have been better as Kung Lao if they ever introduced him), I could think of quite a few actors who would have fit the other characters to a tee... except perhaps Shang Tsung... Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa is quite a talented martial artist and actor in his own right.

Visually it is very rich and the characters are quite well developed.  If you've played the game you'll instantly recognise them and know what they can do.  Even if you haven't played the game this is still well worth watching.One thing to note in this movie are the lack of high-profile actors.  Christopher Lambert is the biggest name in this movie and, ironically, has the worst character and is given the worst lines and delivers the worst performance.  I don't think so and At last, they are learning have to be the more cringe-worthy lines ever spoken on the big screen.  Every line Lambert has he ruins, although they aren't that good to start with.The fact that the main fighters were all unknowns adds to the movie as you consider them as equals.  Had Van Damme or Jackie Chan been in this movie you would instantly flag them as 'the star.'  Despite the actors relative obscurity they do pull off some good combat sequences.  I have seen this on video many times but there are still moves done by Liu Kang (Robin Shou) that have me punching the air every time I see them.Another element that only adds to this movie is the music.  I'm a KMFDM fan anyway, but I feel their theme tune really works in this kind of movie and every time it kicks in it just heightens the excitement.Not the best martial arts movie ever but certainly not the worst.  It is quite strong in a lot of areas and hasn't been skimped on anywhere.  The action, the characters, the visuals, the music...it is all quite high quality and you're getting a lot of movie for your money.

A big-name franchise like Mortal Kombat could at least shell out the cash for more than just one competent actor.

Seriously--the plot makes little sense but it doesn't matter. This is basically just a non-stop series of fights with little bits and pieces of a plot thrown in.This was based on a video game which I never played so I can't say how faithful it is. Still I enjoyed it for what it is--virtual non-stop action and PG-13 rated violence (no gore and very little blood). You just turn off your brain and enjoy. The special effects are excellent, the music is great (always loved the theme music) and the fights exciting. As for acting--well who cares? There's no depth to any of these characters--Liu Kang is the serious one, Johnny Cage the wise guy (who actually has quite a few funny lines) and Sonia is the sex object. Lambert is a howl in a fright wig walking around throwing out bits of wisdom. This was a big hit leading to a sequel (which was terrible) and is considered one of the best video games adaptations ever. Faint praise I know but why do you expect from this? I give it an 8.

It scores pretty high when viewed as any one of films from these genres - if you use the metric of old school kung-fu, and sci-fi flicks. For instance if I think of this as an extension of Shaw Brothers kung-fu movies from the '70s, it makes lot of sense, and if you look at it from perspective of an old school sci-fi like the Dune, it also makes sense. But if you use the metric of newer sci-fi, and action flicks, this lacks imagination, and is visually antiquated. My point is that this movie is just another extension of what's been done up to that point and added nothing new. Maybe that was the point - not to take too much risk and focus on cashable elements. So it's an okay film, and nothing new, and that's how it stands out today when you watch it. There wasn't anything eye opening about this movie, and none of the characters had endearing characteristics to them. Acting was wooden and below par, but that might have been due to the screen play, but maybe they should have brought in at least one or two A list actors to give life to the whole story. The movie was bit morbid and it was due to lack of acting talent in this movie. So in the end, the company who made it accomplished what it started out to do, and made money, but movie isn't anything of a serious caliber in any area of its production.

That being said this did loose some points with me for a few reasons.1) This is PG13 and the source material is Mature (that's Rated R in video game terms) The violence was cut down to appease a wider audience. I found that as a cope out and it should have been Rated R and had all its gory glory.2) They did mesh the first and second games together into one, and their are obvious changes to characters, namely Sub-Zero and Scorpion. But that is forgiven, as it was explained in the story so I am not happy with but I understand it.3) The fights were good but I would have liked more recognizable locations from the Game. They have some vague reference to some locations, the Sonya/Kano fight could be the courtyard, Cage/Scorpion could be the Living Forest, but the second half was meant to be the Netherrealm...though they don't explain how Cage escapes. Liu Kang/Sub-Zero could be a location from MKII. But nothing Definably noticeable.The movie story follows Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade entering the Mortal Kombat tournament for their own reasons. Liu Kang is looking to avenge his brothers death at the hands of Shang Tsung from the prior tournament. Johnny Cage an action movie star is looking to make a name for himself as a real martial artist admit rumors his movies are all fake. Sonya is looking for a dangerous arms dealer named Kano and finds him boarding the ship that is taking the Kombatants to the tournament grounds and subsequently gets entered in the tournament. They are aided and guided by Raiden, the Thunder God and guardian of the Earthrealm. Raiden unlike his game counterpart does not participate in the movie tournament, but acts as coach for the three main characters. Other established characters from the game that appear in the movie are, Princess Kitana, Goro, and Reptile. The Movie also holds a decent cast of actual martial artists as Kombatants (characters and originals for the movie) like Chris Cassamassa as Scorpion and Hakim Alstin as Liu Kang's first opponent.Over all the story progresses very easily and is not difficult to follow, the roles Shang Tsung and Goro play are exactly that of their game counterparts and the matches are choreographed very well. We do also see some of the characters special moves we see Johnny Cage's Shadow Kick, Scorpion's Spear, Sub-Zero's freeze and Liu Kang's Bicycle kick (first seen in MKII) The overall movie I enjoyed and would recommend as a Good Video Game Movie, and actually a Good movie overall.

You could argue that Mortal Kombat is one of the better video game to film adaptations which it probably is but not because it's deep or well made but because it's pretty good fun & delivers what it sets out to & that's to have as many character's from Mortal Kombat beat each other up & give as many name checks & little homages to other aspects of the game as possible including infamous phases like 'flawless victory' & 'fatality'. The fantasy elements are a little silly but in context work well enough & they keep your mind off the lack of story, I would have liked a bit more violence as the Mortal Kombat games was one of the first to show explicit blood & gore inflicted against very human like digitized character's & it just seems odd that the makers went totally in the opposite direction & ignored the extreme violence in favour of some cool if tame martial arts fights. Mortal Kombat is a film you cannot take seriously, it's not set in the real world & there's no real threat & there's a really bad final scene but overall the fights were good & any fan of the game will be entertained & will get all the nods & homages to the game.Most, but not all like Baraka & Kung Lao, of the character's from the video games are here who were originally based on character's or actors from films themselves with Liu Kang the Bruce Lee clone, Johnny Cage is the Jean-Claude Van Damme imitation while Sonya Blade apparently owes her inspiration to Cynthia Rothrock. The fight sequences are well staged with various moves lifted from the game like Liu Kang's bicycle kick or Sub Zero's ice blast or Johnn Cage's low blow & the film has great production values with exotic locations & lush fantasy sets full of giant statues, symbols, skulls, flickering lights, rickety wooden walkways & a real desolate other worldly feel. Some of the CGI computer effects don't hold up that well these days, in particular the Reptile creature looks awful although the huge lumbering four armed monster Goro is quite impressive even if he does get a lacklustre send-off. Cameron Diaz was originally cast to play Sonya Blade but broke her wrist & had to drop out, Brandon Lee was originally cast as Johnny Cage but died before filming on the set of The Crow (1994) while Jean-Claude Van Damme turned down the role of Johnny Cage so he could make another video game adaptation Street Fighter (1994) which in hindsight looks like a bad move.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this had a fair bit spent on it & it looks the part with great sets & some cool martial arts fights although some of the special effects look a little dated. Mortal Kombat was a big success at the box-office going straight in at number one & staying there for three weeks. Filmed in Thailand, California, Budapest, Texas & for some reason Wales. The acting isn't great but Talisa Soto who plays Princess Kitana here is easy on the eye.Mortal Kombat is a martial arts film based on a computer game but takes just as much inspiration from Enter the Dragon, I liked it for what it was & indeed is. Followed by Mortal Kombat Annihilation (1997) & the short lived telly series Mortal Kombat Conquest (1998).

Each character's personality suited his style and background as was shown in the game. The fights were well choreographed in terms of being faithful to the individual styles of players. However, there was one thing missing in the movie. It was the fatalities. Fatalities were not as exciting and brutal as they were in game. Blood and gore, the major reasons for which the game had become famous were far too scaled down in this movie. I am sure the creators of the film were apparently targeting a 13+ age group and must have wanted to cut down on the violence but I could still do with an alternate version with a little of the blood and gore added. And yes, I needed some more fights involving Cage, Sonya and Kitana.The best part of the movie was the music. The music was really amazing and fit right in place. It is the kind of music that makes you want to raise your hands, take a stance and say, Bring it on! The dialgoues borrowed from the game and subjected to a little improvisation were also good. And yes, another important aspect of movie - the sets. The sets came very close to replicating the fighting arenas as shown in the game.

Goro actually looked pretty damn cool given how old this film is, and the CG on Reptile is always good for a laugh The characters were all faithfully portrayed too. Look at the Street Fighter and Mario movies, release around the same time and tell me the same could've been said about those. This was faithful.

The storyline of MK is, all though elaborate, very limited and somewhat cliché. Don't get me wrong, aside from a few flops I love the game series, but... come on.Anyhow, the casting for this film is rather good, aside from Sonja, who I think was a terrible choice. In fact, the actors used for Scorpion and Sub-Zero did an outstanding job.For the budget, the film was done very expertly, and even though there are a few alterations from the game series, it is surprisingly loyal. The characters are essentially the same, aside from the costumes being a little different, and Scorpion's spear being organic and spawning from his palm, and the spear concept felt more suiting to me. Scorpion is suppose to be macabre, while Sub-Zero is meant to be silent and intimidating (which is done very well here). My only major complaints are...1. Kano. I liked the job they did, but he was too young to be Kano. I picked this character being around 45 in the games, and this guy was a lot younger. They did make him have the perfect personality, though. Sadly, he died far too easily, and at the hands (or in a more literal sense, feet) of my least favourite character.2. Goro. A lot of people seemed to like him in this, I think he was done poorly. Goro is a classic character from MK, more-so than any other 'boss' figure, and he's known for being infamously tyrannical and monstrous. Even in this film, for a time, he seems invincible, but at the same time he seems like a miserable lap-dog to Shang Tsung, rather than an employed champion. His voice was terrible for the fact that... I never pictured Goro talking much. Yes, I figured he'd speak sometimes, but in this he talks all of the time, usually spewing out pathetic dialogue and half-a$$ed roars. And then you have his death... Johnny Cage uses 'Ball Breaker' on him to escape him, and then runs out onto the outer ledge of the tower and tricks Goro into falling off and plummeting to his demise. Goro would beat Johnny to Hell and Back, but I guess there's just no way to include Goro in the films without killing him off, and the first MK film couldn't be much of a movie without him, I just wish they found a better way for him to die, or maybe a mystery death where people aren't sure if he actually is gone. I just hope the new film doesn't include Kintaro, because I know after seeing what this movie did with Goro, and what they did with Sheeva in the sequel, they are terrible at expressing Shokans in film form.However, many things did impress me. The entire concept of Sub-Zero was brilliant, I could not have done him better (even though he could have been involved a LITTLE longer). The idea of Scorpion was exactly what I pictured, except they took his catch phrase a bit too far by making him say Get Down Here! in the same way. Shang Tsung was casted very well. A creepy, older man who looks almost harmless but turns out to be entirely brutal. That's exactly what you get from him in the games, and they did they successfully in this movie. Liu Kang was done well, maybe better than the games did him, but the actor seemed to try a little too hard to look like Bruce Lee in the fight scenes. Raiden... could really go either way, and there's nothing very notable about him. I didn't hate the actor who played him, but I think they could have found somebody better if they really tried.Overall, MK is a good game-to-movie adaptation. It's impressive to see a loyal game film, and seeing as how this movie had almost no blood in it... and still entertained me, I couldn't think much higher of it. I would like to see it redone with some casting changes, a little more length, and an R rating due to some gore, but I enjoyed it.8/10 "},{"Title":"A really entertaining action packed martial arts movie a good adaptation to the popular video game.","Date":"25 September 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" This movie was very good according to me and is the best movie by far that portrays a popular video game and this movie deserves the number one spot considering how well this movie did.

Robin Shou who played Liu Kang also choreographed the many fight scenes that took place and they portray good martial arts as well. They may not be as fast as say a Jackie Chan film, but the movements you can catch and are fast enough to be exhilarated. Also you can't help but feel the heart that some of the fighters find in themselves. A quote from Christopher Lambert's character Raiden appealed to me the most. You possess the knowledge all that's lacking is the will. So basically what that's saying is will will help a person overcome obstacles that may be crucial no matter what the situation is. Other characters include Johnny Cage played by Linden Ashby who serves the comedy purpose and does serious when he needs to. Also Sonya Blade played by Bridgette Wilson-Sampras who's one of your typical tough women. The chemistry between her and Johnny I found to be opposite and common at the same time which was quite amusing at times. Action flick fans will enjoy this movie.

Another realm, Outworld, is ruled by an evil sorcerer, Shang Tsung, who takes his victim's souls (bum bum bummmm.....)For one reason or another, which isn't specifically stated, should Outworld win 10 tournaments in a row, they will able to conquer Earthrealm. Well, they have won 9, and this will make 10.The major heroes of this movie are Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade. Liu Kang had fled to America from Japan and the Temple of Light, due to he didn't believe in all the fight-to-save-the-world jazz, yet his brother, Chan, did. Chan foolishly challenges Shang Tsung, and loses the fight, and his soul. So, Liu Kang enters the tournament to represent the Temple of Light at the Tournament, to avenge his brother's death.Johnny Cage is a big-shot movie star in the movie, who is having bad times with the press thinking he's a fake. His old master comes and tells him of the ancient tournament known as Mortal Kombat, and tells him that if he fights, he'll win the respect of the world. Johnny decides to go, and it is later found out by the audience that Johnny's master had been killed, and the man that told Johnny of the tournament was none other than.....Shang Tsung.Sonya Blade is in the Special Forces in the United States, who is hunting another main villain of the movie, Kano. Kano had killed one of Sonya's partner, and she has been hunting Kano restlessly. Kano is hired by (you guess it) Shang Tsung to lure Sonya Blade to the island where the tournament will be held, which in essence, brings Johnny Cage, Liu Kang, and Sonya Blade to the tournament.I'll bet you're wondering What happens next? right?

I give it a 10 because it deserved it, despite being based on a game series. My only beef (Which wasn't enough to lower its score) was that they didn't have my favorite character, Kung Lao (They had a reference to it, saying that he was Liu Kang's father, but nothing else) In any case, this deserves its ten.First off, the battles. They weren't cheesy like I've seen in some movies. They were inventive and not all of them the same (Like the games, where every battle had pretty much the same strategy). The fights with Scorpion and Sub-Zero were cool, mainly because of Sub-Zero's freezing abilities and Scorpion's weird skeleton face. I also liked the battle with Reptile, though when Liu squashed all of the bugs I got a little grossed out...The music was also excellent. I downloaded the main theme and I love it. It has a nice techno beat as well as the announcer guy from the games saying different phrases (Fight! Finish him! Excellent) and the character names. Sure, it doesn't get much more inventive than the one song, but it's good anyway. The single song makes up for the otherwise lack of it.The dialogue is also good. There are some pretty funny parts (Like Johnny's famous fight movie fight scene This is the part where you fall down.) as well as when he fights Goro. They even took some of the moves from the games and the actors used them (There weren't many, mind, but...). Between this movie and its sequel (Mortal Kombat Annhilation), they used almost every character in the MK universe.The actors were good, too. Some movies have terrible actors that make good dialogue sound bad, but this movie had good dialogue and actors. The characters sound believable (With Kano's evilness, Sonya's want for revenge, and Johnny's cockiness). I think this movie truly deserved a higher score than 5.1.

S. Anderson isn't that bad. Mortal Kombat incorporates a lot of elements from the series' first two games into its plot. Unlike the Street Fighter movie, product a year earlier, this movie has an underground fighting tournament. It's here, that Shaolin warrior Liu Kang (Robin Shou), U.S. Special Forces agent Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), and Hollywood superstar Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) meet each other. Handpicked by Raiden (Christopher Lambert), the god of lightning and defender of the Earth realm; the three mortals must travel to an uncharted island to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld, an evil realm build on constant fighting from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. The premise of the film is greatly influenced by 1973's Enter the Dragon, you really see it in the movie pacing. Each of the three has a character arch for his or her own reason for competing Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) for killing his brother; Sonya seeks revenge on crime lord Kano (Trevor Goddard) and Cage, having been branded as a fake fighter by the media, seeks to prove them wrong. The character of Art Lean (Kenneth Edwards) doesn't appear in the games. He was created exclusively for the film. I kinda wish, they used another character from the game to replace him, because it's really predictable, whom of the good guys will probably end up dying during the tournament. While, that part of the tournament, makes sense, the whole idea of the tournament as a whole, doesn't. Mortal Kombat is held once a generation to determine Earth's fate. Outworld need to successfully defeated Earth's best challengers in ten consecutive tournaments to conquering humanity. Why? I guess, the tournament existed; as Raiden explains, the tournament is designed to give humans a chance to fight for their world against realms with greater powers, which keeps the realms in check so the strongest ones simply cannot invade the less powerful ones at will. Why again? It's seem like they can travel to Earth, very easy. While, the story doesn't make any sense, the action was alright. Still, you can tell, the different between those actors with some fighting skills, with those with none. Some of them are so slow, and choreograph as hell that it doesn't look real. The PG-13 rating kinda hurt the film, due to the game, being known as very violent and gory. Still, they did what, they can do with it. Lots of freeze deaths, falling off cliffs, and stabbing with no blood. Lots of Easter eggs like finishing moves, and a hint of the 'Friendship' finisher. It was very funny to see that. The special effects are a hit and a misses. The 1990s CGI is barely realistic for me, but at the time, it was alright. The character, Reptile looks kinda stupid, due to that. The puppeteer that control Goro's movement were pretty good. Kevin Michael Richardson did pretty OK job in the voice acting for him. The sets are pretty haunting with the abandoned Kaiser steel mill, being used for Outworld. I love that the movie used the location of Old Ayutthaya as the temples of the Shaolin Monks. It was a nice touch. The movie moves really fast; there is little to no slow moments in the film. I'm pretty glad, they cut the idea of Liu Kang was supposed to fall in love with Kitana (Talisa Soto). It's also pretty cool to see an Asian character in the main role, with white supporting characters. I don't even mind, the fact, that supporting characters like Kanos whom is Japanese-American in the game, and Raiden whom is Chinese in the game, were played by white actors. I just glad, to see Liu Kang as the lead. You rarely see Asian actors in the main role in films. The acting is over the top, and mediocre at best. There were a lot of cheesy dialogue that could had been cut. The soundtrack of Mortal Kombat became a huge hit on its own, becoming a fitness jam that seriously gets you pumped for anything. The movie was well received by fans and was a box office hit at the time, leading to a sequel, 1997's Mortal Kombat Annihilation, which was not well received, even by camp movie standards. Also check out the 1995's prequel animated film The Journey Begins or the spin-off television series, 1996's Mortal Kombat Defenders of the Realm and 1998's Mortal Kombat Konquest for Mortal Kombat fix. Nonetheless, the original introduced its own take on the mythology, some of which was integrated into the canon of future games. Overall Movies based on video games have never been great, but I believe most can agree that Paul W. S. Anderson put more effort into creating this movie than what other directors have given their video-game film adaptations. This movie is an great example. It was very memorable.

This is true, the characterisation was slipshod at best, however, again, action can be interesting and amusing without reasonable characterisation sometimes.  Perhaps then it is the fault of the script writers.  The script was horrendously bad, marked chiefly by dialogue that simply did not fit in with the action taking place visually, and of course, sometimes contradicting the story.  I am not sure if they really did employ script writers on this movie, or perhaps they were foreign and something was lost in the translation, but again action can be interesting even if the script is poor.  The special effects were equally dismal with the 'Goro' character looking laughably silly waddling around, 'Kane's' head looking like it was stolen on trick or treat night and sundry other bizarre blunders.  The whole film did have a distinctly tacky and silly look.  The designs were pathetic, the film itself had an atmosphere of cheapness, and the enemies all looked uninnovative and unimpressive.  The direction was bad with the main characters, and villain being shown in an amiable comic style.  The action was unimpressive because when all of these deficiencies are taken into account there is nothing positive to say.  The directing was particularly woeful, but the script writers too must accept a large amount of the blame for this waste of film.  The acting did come over as being of a very poor standard as well, but I would refrain from criticising that since with that script, that plot, and that director, they never stood a chance.

To make it work like the game, you are forced to make it look nothing like the genre -- but there goes your brand.Three elements here honest earnest heros, evil scheming villains, but most important even more exotic (and therefore more engaging) tests of physical prowess.For this to work, the scheming and exotic challenge needs to enter the story the evil ones are not just messing with the hapless heros, but with the viewer as well.

It was rubbish.  This is just another of those martial arts movies that can only appeal to children and those who need to be told (but still don't believe) that WWF Wrestling is faked.  The kind of people who think that Steven Seagal really is one of the hardest men on the planet.  These films are always full of fights that are choreographed by people who seem never to have seen a real fight (or even a decent movie fight), the characters taking turns to execute their ridiculous moves. If this is your thing, then I envy you; it means you can get enjoyment from the worst of movies as well as the best. It is a huge mistake to make a film with such a violent premise as gladiatorial death matches for children; it can't be done! Kids from 6 to 13 years would have loved this film had the violence been trimmed to make it suitable for them and yet as it stands, the adult viewer is disappointed with the *lack* of violence. Another problem was Christopher Lambert; he is quite a big name and would have undoubtedly taken a serious chunk out of the budget.  I think they would have been wiser to have hired another newcomer for the role of Rayden and kept the money they would have saved for better art direction and SFX. They had the script in their hands and must have known that it wouldn't make money on its own; so they gambled on star-power to save them.  What they forgot was that even Lawrence Olivier can look awful with a bad script. They gambled and lost.  The film was obviously short of money; the sets were of television standard and lighting has its limits on what it can do to hide this sort of thing.  The effects were the same; a small effects house with an inexperienced team cannot hope to look as good as the likes of the masters at I.L.M.  The acting was unremarkable, nothing that any soap actor couldn't have done.  The female interest was lacklustre and ordinary looking with even Talisa Soto so poorly lit she looked bland.  The plot was weak as wet tissue paper and the fact that the movie was based on a video game is no excuse; it was so full of holes the cast could have fallen through them (and I wish they had)!  The soundtrack was a vulgar synthesized effort that any music student still in university could have knocked up in his bedroom. Still, as I said, it will appeal to some people...because some people can get excited by monster trucks! Rating Very poor, 2/10.

A lot of people who are not familiar with the game(s) will most likely not enjoy this movie as much as people who did play the game(s). The thing is, the game is a very silly and wrong fighting-game. This movie is a very silly and wrong fighting-movie, so with that I think a lot of people must agree with me that this movie is at least a good remake of the game.The plot of this movie is about 3 people going to a fighting-tournament called Mortal Kombat (makes sense right?) to fight for their own personal reasons. It is a very thin story-line, but perfect for a movie like this that is mostly about fighting. The cast is very good. Neither of them are great actors by any means, but they look and act like the characters in the game, especially Liu Kang. My favorite parts are where Liu Kang does his 'bicycle'-kick move like in the games. This is exactly what makes this movie good; it doesn't drive away from the core of the series (fighting), they included scenery and moves from the game, and it features characters from the game.To top it off, this movie is also supported with great special effects for its time, and a awesome soundtrack that fits perfect with the B-movie atmosphere. The only remotely bad thing I can see is that this movie has a sequel called Mortal Kombat Annihilation that is unworthy of the name Mortal Kombat. But in conclusion, if you enjoy action and fantasy films or any of the games overall, then this movie is for you.

The music and several characters, of which there is a nice amount, as far as I know, are straight out of those releases. Shou is a martial artist before an actor, but hey, which will draw in a bigger audience for this? In fact, that seems to be the general rule here, with Wilson as a possible exception(and some that aren't skilled at either). Great decision, casting the king of B flicks, Lambert. The fighting tends to be marvelous, if some could have been captured better. The slow-motion in this is seldom effective. This is very much an Anderson piece&#133; some of the humor really doesn't fit the otherwise reasonably well-established dark tone(presumably it was to avoid this taking itself too seriously, but it instead winds up making parts come off silly, whilst not even accomplishing said task), I'm specifically referring to Ashby's remarks.

So this movie would be a success.The movie displays at perfection the events of the original MK plot. You know, the chosen warriors have been invited to the tournament in order to be defeated and that way, Shang Tsung and his evil empire would enter Earth and start a reign of terror. The chosen warriors are Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, and Liu Kang. The out world kombatants (or villains) are Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Reptile, Goro, and Shang Tsung. Unlike the video game, Rayden cannot fight in this tournament. So, basically, the movie displays the plot at perfection. The fight sequences are also great and are a deadly combination of martial arts moves with the distinctive Mortal Kombat special powers. Here is where my big problem with the movie begins. Now, don't get me wrong, I won't bash this movie because I liked it overall. Still, my problem with the movie is that I, along with thousands of fans, got too involved with the thematic of Mortal Kombat. And by thematic I mean gore, violence, fatalities, a macabre setting and chilling sound stages. The movie has a 100% martial arts feeling mixed with techno music. Now, I understand that in order to make it big time in mainstream cinema, you need elements such as big budget, a catchy soundtrack, and a famous director. The MK video games were 100% dark until MK3. No space for techno music or jokes (despite the Friendships which were 100% black humor). Back in 1995 I expected a gory movie with dark character development and of course, FATALITIES! Where the hell was Sub-Zero's spine cord rip? Or Cage's torso rip? , etc.Anyways, this movie was intended for a PG-13 audience although the games are restricted for adult players. Still the movie is pretty good and follows the story to perfection, even has some in jokes that make reference to the games.The acting is pretty good. Special mention deserves Trevor Goddard (R.I.P.) who delivers a wicked, macho performance. Bridgette Wilson delivers a sexy, believable performance. She's a delight to watch. Robin Shoue is convincing as the hero and Linden Ashby convinces as the charming hunk. Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa is in my opinion the best villain from any video game movie adaptation. The guy is simply terrific! Christopher Lamber is okay as a bad ass but black humored Lord Rayden. I dug his personality. Goro was a cool, spectacular villain.Anyways, watch Mortal Kombat to experience probably the best video game adaptation to any fighting game to date.

It fits the story. The effects are great. The martial arts fights are phenomenal. The fights, the background music, the settings. With the choreography of Pat Johnson and Robin Shou they created an atmosphere that was almost touchable.Further, this was a perfect mix of serious and comedic actors (Johnny Cage, Linden Ashby). And even if you think that they're not so good, Chris Lambert and Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa were well cast and could have saved this movie on their own.Ever since 1995 this movie makes me feel like training even harder in martial arts than I ever did, and it still does.

I really could sense his will to fight Goro and I really felt the friendship between him and Johnny Cage. I really believe Art Lean should have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. As for the movie, Christopher Lambert seemed outdated and the action scenes were extremely lame.... except for Art Lean's action scenes. Art Lean really expressed Mortal Kombat to its fullest and I can't believe Art Lean wasn't a character in the game.All in all I believe that instead of Mortal Kombat it should be called, The Adventures of Art Lean in the Mortal Kombat Tournament. Liu Kang should have been fighting to save him not his own brother. So check out this movie because of Art Lean and not because of everyone else.

The story is simple, a handful of people on a leaky boat have to save the world from the forces of Outworld, by defeating them in a scared competition called Mortal Kombat. The whole cast in this movie give it life. Robin Shou as Lui Kang does well as the unwilling hero. C.Lambert is absolutely brilliant as tough guy Rayden. B. Wilson as Sonya with the I don't need anyone attitude is okay, Talisa Soto as Kitana the wise one is cool, Linden Ashby is the perfect wise cracking picture of Johnny Cage and all the bad guys kick ass. The greatest performance however was Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Shang Shung, the guy is absolute class. He looks like Shung, he walks, talks and fights like Shung. He performed the role of the evil sorcerer to perfection. They was he expressed his lines and how he put emphasis on the right words at the right time was acting at its best.The fighting scenes and the music throughout the whole movie was special to say the least. All the fights were so cool, it's too hard to pick which was the best. Being Mortal Kombat there should be a lot of fighting, that's the whole point of the movie and it delivers. Also the story is simple but good and the acting is good also and along with the reasonable special effects, it has three traits the sequel lacking. In terms of the music and the fighting they're pretty much equal but this film has got the story and decent acting the second movie lacking. Definitely worth a look.

It does action, and it does it well, without trying to throw in too much of a plot.

Simple as that.But don't think I'm cutting the movie down -- I love Mortal Kombat. It's one of my favorite movies of all time.

He may not bring perfection in concordance to the original design (i.e. Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, etc.), but he does bring a story. There were some things he could have gone farther with, but those can be overlooked and forgiven. What *can't* be forgiven is the fact the director of the second MK, John R. Leonetti movie was the DoP (Director of Photography) of this movie, and did not even bring a fraction of good film-making in the second film. Leonetti in comparison to Paul Anderson could be the second Ed Wood, or even the second Uwe Boll.What I admire about the film is the camera work (the only thing I'll give Leonetti kudos for); especially in the fighting scenes. It actually reflects upon how fight scenes were shot in the old Chinese movies. Instead of having the fight seen from up close (where you don't know what the hey is going on), you have wide shots so that you can see what is going on. And, actually, the fighters from afar looked *really* fast and really strong. The best fighting scene in the whole movie was the fight between Johnny Cage and Scorpion; it was just outstanding in the highest, and really put on a show for me. And more hand-to-hand combat movies should have more focus on the fight from a good distance as opposed to boring the audience with blinding up-close shots.A great story point in the movie was the point where Liu Kang frees all the souls captured by Shang Tsung, in it that it shows how evil can defeat itself; because Shang Tsung, even with the souls of countless warriors, could not defeat Liu Kang. It may not go with how the original games were going for, but this part in the movie certainly goes for what the film was going for; and that's a big and important difference that fans have to be aware of.I give Paul 8 out of 10; a good vote in my opinion.

Several times they used game catch phrases in a cheesy manner for a game pop (Game editor Boon's flawlessvictory, fatality) though once or twice they used it in a proper way(Scorpian's Get over here). Bad acting or bad scene writing isnotable in the movie as seen in the end though there are a few humorousone liners. Mortal Kombat shows it has a better plot by remaining loyal (or asclose as possible to) the plot of the game though it does stray off attimes and touches upon the second Mortal Kombat game (Kitana, YoungShang Tsung). Where as in Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Super MarioBros, it appears they made up it up on the go or drastically changedthe storyline to fit some humorous motive. I found several of the cast selected to play the various characters tobe interest though I question their picking Christoper Lamber asRaiden. I enjoy Robin Shou as Lui Kang and he does have theappearance of the Lui Kang of the game as well as the fighting ability. I can not judge if it was bad acting or bad script that effected themovie. The special effects are good and not over doing it unlike StreetFighter which relied upon it heavily (Goro).

The movie is a combination of quickly sketched out, paper thin characters that can't serve a decent role, poor acting, barely any plot, pointless action, cheesy dialogue, and so on. I could just laugh at how poorly done the movie was. Mortal Kombat relies only on quick, paced action, which relates to the videogames. Their is no creative plot. The movie is laden with multiple fight scenes, which is what any teenage boy would enjoy. However, there is a good soundtrack and some memorable lines such as Fatality and Get over here. With the exception of the few positive things written, the rest of the film is complete rubbish. Even as a fan of the Mortal Kombat video games, I found myself offended by the film adaptation. Mortal Kombat would have been a better movie had Paul W.S. Anderson not have directed it. Unfortunately, the idea of making Mortal Kombat into a motion picture was wasted.

Directed by Paul Anderson (Event Horizon, Resident Evil), it tells the story of three people who have come to a mysterious island to fight in a martial arts tournament. The three people are Liu Kang, a former monk who has returned home to avenge the murder of his younger brother; Johnny Cage, an actor whose martial arts skills are in serious doubt; and Sonya Blade, a police officer who is chasing after a dangerous criminal. They are introduced into the tournament by the mysterious Shang Tsung, who is really an evil sorcerer, and who also if he wins the tournament for the tenth time in a row, will be able to conquer the world. Shang Tsung's mortal enemy, Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) is trying to get the three people to be able to fight and save the world as well. And so the fight begins...First of all, I really do not know how anyone could truly hate this film without saying that they at least enjoyed the well-choreographed martial arts sequences. I'll admit that the acting may not be that good, but the fights almost certainly make up for it. I mean the fights are the heart and soul of this film. My favorite fight is the one between Johnny Cage and Scorpion on the plantation and later in his lair. The sets are amazing too.The aforementioned plantation and Scorpion's Lair, as well as Outworld, all look great. I am a huge fan of the Mortal Kombat video games and I must say that it remains very faithful in terms of story and characters. Many of the other characters are here as well and who include Jax (Sonya's partner) and Kano (a one-eyed criminal who Sonya had been chasing). My personal favorite ninjas are here too. There is Sub-Zero, who has the ability to freeze things; Scorpion, who has a spear that comes out of his hand which he uses to subdue his opponents; and lastly Reptile, a dragon-like creature that has assumed human form through a re-animated corpse. As I said before, Mortal Kombat is an amazing video game adaptation that has held up extremely well.

Mortal Kombat is one of the most violent blood-baths that ever hit the arcade in 1992 and we all know that there was no way that they can fit all that gore into a PG-13 or 15 film, this film should have been rated R or 18 instead. It's not Mortal Kombat without blood. Also, Scorpion and Sub-Zero are awesome in this film but sadly, they are under the control of Shang Tsuang and they never explain why. Also, they don't really make Scorpion or Sub- Zero very memorable (at least in my case anyway) which is a shame because they are the most recognizable characters of the video game series.

Scorpion has his iconic line Get Over Here! and it really makes me pumped up considering that I'm big fan of the video game series. The action sequences in this film were really awesome and they made it pretty brutal, it was simple and entertaining to watch.

Also, all characters in this movie made the spectator believe Shan Tsung was a quite strong sorcerer, and when we finally get to see him fighting with Liu Kang, their fight is very light and Shan Tsung dies too easily for such a strong character.

I believe I heard the soundtrack first, because I was getting interested in electronic music at that point and still find Orbital's songs on the soundtrack to be very good. I was hanging with my 14 year old nephew and we were looking for a movie to watch on cable, so we came across Mortal Kombat. I lied and told him it was a good movie and it was free, so we figured what the heck? My brother joined us as he had never seen it. We laughed nonstop through this movie. Johnny Cage's moves were horrendous and it's not like the character required a good actor, which they didn't get anyways, so they could have paid a bit more for Jean Claude Van Damme and gotten a person with some acting experience as well as a person to pull off the martial arts believably. The guy who played Kano was horrible, as were his moves. The same goes for Sonja. The director butchered her patented hand standing move where she grabs a guy by his head with her legs and flips him over, or flings him through the air. Cables would have fixed this, but they didn't use them for that scene, however they did the same move with Liu Kang later in the movie. Goro is also hilarious to watch, and when he is supposed to do the move where he grabs an opponent and pummels him, the viewer is left with only this awkward sequence where Goro pounds the guy once due to the limitations of the animatronics involved. Reptile CGI looks OK in some parts, but really bad in others. At one point I started cracking up because this movie was starting to get ridiculous. The boat (sailboat) had bilge pumps and a see through floor built into the hull and I don't really picture Shang Tsung heading down below to observe sharks, coral, or manta rays. Scorpion and Sub Zero were on the same side, despite them being enemies. Towards the end I began laughing so hard I was crying, because Rayden's (Lambert) dialog was just too ridiculous for anyone to take it seriously. Rayden also does not fight in the tournament, despite having cool powers, and Lambert who has done action before. Some scenery and sets look good, while others are not so good. The scene on the deck of the boat was horrible, including the stars which looked like Christmas lights or holes poked through black paper in front of some lights. Would it have killed the producers to find a real boat and film at night? Acting was less that something I would expect in a 3rd grade play. Liu Kang was by far the most talented fighter in this production. Story made no real attempt to stick to the video game, which is surprising, because it's written by the game's creators. The stunt/fighting choreography was less than I would expect from a theatrical release and I'm being polite. With all that being said I still had a great time watching this movie, as it made me nostalgic, gave me some quality time with my nephew, and I've never laughed so hard, even at a comedy. There's no shame in having a really bad movie that people will still watch years later. I'd rather watch this movie than some pretentious movie where everything is supposed to be so artistic. I will remember this movie like my parents remember the B movies from their past. 20 years from now I will watch this, but I wouldn't watch inception, or The Dark Knight. I wish they had gotten better writers for this movie. I also would have paid a bit more to get guys like Seagal, Van Damme, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, or any other host of actors who could have pulled it off at that time, and they wouldn't have demanded the money actors demand today. There was a scene where Johnny Cage walks off the set of a movie and his director is yelling for him to come back. The director kind of looks like Spielberg and my sister in law asked if it was him. Everyone was laughing and told her that Spielberg wouldn't be in the same time zone as the filming locations just in case...

Anderson (Resident Evil, AVP Alien vs. Predator, Death Race), there are some terrible films based on video games, e.g. Silent Hill, Doom, this was one of the first I heard apparently worked for viewers, so I watched. Based on the popular video game franchise this tells the story of an ancient fight tournament where different Realms of the best of the best battle each other. Ten wins will allow a take over of the losing Realm, Outworld led by the Emperor's sorcerer Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) has so far won nine times and collected against Earthrealm. It is up to three human warriors, Liu Kang (Robin Shou) avenging his brother, law enforcement officer Sonya Blade (Bridgette Wilson), and egotistical movie star Johnny Cage (Linden Ashby) to stop the opposite side gaining final flawless victory. The undefeated champion Goro (Kevin Michael Richardson) is obviously going to be the hardest to win against, but united by Lord Rayden (Christopher Lambert) they are gaining the power and ability they need to do it, and in the end of course they do it. Also starring Licence to Kill's Talisa Soto as Princess Kitana, Trevor Goddard as Kano, Chris Casamassa as Scorpion, François Petit as Sub-Zero and Keith H. Cooke as Reptile. Having played the game myself on Playstation I was interested to see how many of the characters I would recognise, and if they could really bring the fun of punching and killing the opponents, especially in the special effects for powers and violence amount, it did not quite have enough of this stuff, but it is not a completely boring martial arts action adventure.

It's a question that has tormented movie fans since the beginning of time... Well, at least since 1995 when this was released.Sure this film is over the top and stupid and has some really weird performances, but is it actually bad? Now some will say Yes right off the bat and I completely understand this. It's based on a video game, it's plot doesn't really make sense if you really think about it, and the fight genre is not for everyone.Mortal Kombat is about an inter generational Martial Arts tournament taking place in another dimension known as the Outer Realm. If the Outer realm wins 10 in a row they get to invade the realm containing earth. They have won 9 on the back of the dominance of the Realm's host Shang Tsung. So the earth fighters are going to need to lift their game and kick some serious outer realm ass or we are all going to get invaded by outer realm emperor Shao Khan. Now I'm kind of expecting that the further I get through explaining what happens in this movie, the more people are going to decide it's not their thing.Representing Earth in this tournament are shaolin warrior Lui Kang who wants to avenge the death of his brother Chan at the hands of Shang Tsung, Martial Arts Movie star Johnny Cage, who is upset that no one recognizes his awesome fighting skills and so decides to compete in a tournament in another dimension that no one in our dimension will ever see or know about to prove it, and Sonya, who's a policewoman in some weird type of whacky futuristic police force who wants to take revenge on some bad super villain named Kano.They get there, meet Thunder God Rayden (Christopher Lambert in a bizarre performance), the defender of our realm, find out what Mortal Kombat is all about and off they go to fight.It is the fight scenes in this that really work, or maybe I should say work the best. The fights are varied, from slug fests, to prop driven magic, to (unevenly edited) battles with monsters and the way the tournament works isn't always explained well. When you lose, Shang Tsung takes your soul. Bit of a downer. Anyway, you can pick from the start that this is all going to come down to an epic battle between Lui Kang and Shang Tsung.Kang emerges victorious, but not to be outdone, Shao Khan turns up at the end to invade our Realm. Rendering the final battle, the Mortal Kombat tournament and indeed the entire film, completely pointless.In the cast, the only one that really went on to do much was Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who played Shang Tsung who was and remains something of a go to actor in films looking at Asian culture, he went on to star in Memoirs of a Geisha along with many other films. Bridget Wilson, who played Sonya, went on to become Mrs Pete Sampras. Robin Shou, who played Lui Kang, went on to star in the sequel to this Mortal Kombat Annihilation (dreadful) Dead or Alive, another video game movie, and the Death Race series, which felt like a video game too. Linden Ashby, who played Johnny Cage hit bit parts in Iron Man 3 and Resident EvilExtinction, but was mainly into straight to DVD films after this. The film also stars former Bond Girl Talisa Soto (License To Kill) as a millennia old woman trapped in the body of a young hottie. They're kind of OK in this I guess? There is a lot to poke fun at and even hate here, but I just can't hate it. It's inoffensive, silly and kinda fun. If it doesn't sound like your type of movie from what I've mentioned, go with that first instinct. However, if you don't mind martial arts flicks and you're in the mood for silly, give it a look.

Since I've never been a video game buff, I've never been familiar with the Mortal Kombat game. I don't think I ever heard of this film before 2001, when I first heard the soundtrack of its apparently inferior 1997 sequel, Mortal Kombat Annihilation. For a while, I knew about the two films without ever seeing them, but I recently came across a copy of this first one at the video store, in the action section, so I decided to rent it. After doing so, I don't think I'll ever watch the sequel, that's for sure! An ancient tournament called Mortal Kombat is held every generation. In each tournament, warriors from Earth fight against warriors from Outworld. The evil Emperor of Outworld plans to conquer Earth, but in order to do so, Outworld will have to win ten tournaments in a row. However, they have already won nine in a row, so Earth must win the next one in order to save their planet! On Earth, Lord Rayden gathers a group of martial arts experts together; Sonya Blade, Liu Kang, and Johnny Cage, who are all taken to the island where Mortal Kombat is about to take place, and where they will have to fight for Earth! With Outworld very close to being able to conquer their world, the pressure is on! This movie has a lot of action in it, you don't have to worry about that, but action isn't everything. It doesn't start very well at all with the dream sequence (showing a dream that Liu Kang has), and personally, I found very little excitement in the film. It's filled with mindless action, and not in a good way. I found most of the fight scenes simply boring, and sometimes found them unintentionally funny because they were so bad (a lot like certain Power Ranger battles, but maybe funnier), but very rarely. I guess it could have been fun if the film had a lot more sequences like that. Some scenes put a puzzled look on my face, though I can't remember which ones, which I guess shows how forgettable this film is (I certainly can't describe it as memorably bad).After my experience watching Mortal Kombat, it isn't much other than mediocre and forgettable in my book. I'm not sure whether being familiar with the video game would have effected my opinion on this film or not, but as a casual viewer, I have stated what I think. I feel that even 5/10 MIGHT be too generous. So, I think I've made it obvious why I won't be watching Mortal Kombat Annihilation. Sequels can usually be expected to be inferior to their predecessors, even if their predecessors aren't that good, so it's no surprise that the Mortal Kombat sequel is generally regarded as inferior to this film, and is also generally regarded as very bad! If you like electronic music (like techno), then I'm sure you would enjoy listening to the soundtracks for both movies, but unfortunately, this movie itself doesn't have much entertainment value, and I'm sure I can assume that's the case with the sequel as well!

When this movie was released, I was psyched and I was satisfied when I first saw it. Well, I was young and naive back then, and as I've grown, so have my taste in movies. Now I can't watch this movie without laughing at how terrible it really is.You can tell the writers didn't spend more than 5 minutes working out the story of this movie. I mean, sure, it's based on a fighting game...but come ON. These guys could've at least TRIED. Mortal Kombat is a tournament held every year and if the Outworld (basically another dimension) win ten tournaments in a row, they take control of Earth. Well, it's year ten and the Outworld have had a nice nine year winning streak. The fate of the Earth has fallen into the hands of three people Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, and Johnny Cage. Kang (Robin Shou) is a member of the White Lotus clan attending the tournament to avenge his brother. Sonya (Bridgette Wilson) is a government agent following a criminal to the tournament to avenge her partner. And Cage is an arrogant movie star attending to improve his image. That's about all the character development we're given; I guess nothing else about these three really matters. The writing overall is pretty bad.Aside from the thin story and shallow characters, the dialogue is laughably bad throughout. Characters generally spout off crappy one-liners and intelligence is minimum. The worst has to have been the evil Outworld sorcerer, Shang Tsung (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa). Few of his lines were ever more than 3-4 words, and most of them were just sound bites from the game! I swear, the majority of his lines were growling Finish him! or Fatality!. Like I said, these writers didn't even TRY. The only time we get any real dialogue out of Tsung is when he's going off on some Bond-villainesque plot explanation halfway through the movie, basically five minutes of exposition to make sure the viewer understands the situation.I can't comment on this title without mentioning the craptastic special effects. I realize that this movie came out in 1995, but seriously, these effects are even bad by 1995 standards. Prince Goro, an Outworld creature with four arms, looks like a muppet. The powers displayed by Shang Tsung and Rayden look like something from the 1980's. The absolute worst has to have been Reptile. Before he possess a statue and takes human form, Reptile looks like a Saturday morning cartoon! It's horrible, and Scorpion's harpoon isn't much better. On top of these outdated special effects, I think what really annoyed me was the film's lighting. For some reason, this film's cinematographer thought it'd be a spiffy idea to use colored party gels...a LOT of them. One scene would be completely blue, another green, and so on. What was this man thinking? This movie had a $20 million budget!! Where did all that money go?! It sure didn't go into production value...With so much negative things to say about this movie, I'm sure there's gotta be SOME good...Well, the fights were halfway decent. The choreography wasn't half bad, especially the final battle. Of course, the fights are missing the one thing that made the Mortal Kombat video games unique...GORE. The video games are known for their use of gore effects and the only blood we see in this PG-13(!) movie is Shang Tsung's bloody lip. WHY?!?! All right, well I guess I can't really think of anything good to say about this movie other than the actors LOOK like the fighters from the game. At least they did something well. I understand this movie is based off of a fighting game, but that doesn't mean the production team shouldn't try. Sadly enough though, this movie really is one of the better movies that is based off a video game, if only because its mildly entertaining. Fans of the video game prepare to be disappointed.

I decided to rekindle my lost youth by watching this film version. I was hoping for a fun, distracting piece of nonsense that would be entertaining but forgettable at the same time. Well it was forgettable alright, but not what I would call entertaining...The big problem here is the story which is quite poorly conceived. Although the Liu Kang story arc is quite well established, the Sonia Blade storyline with Kano isn't very well developed meaning for me that this aspect of the film was quite uninteresting. The fight scene between Blade and Kano was also quite poor and really lacked any kind of intensity. Johnny Cage tags along as the requisite jock who was more of a smug irritant than anything else.This leads me on to another big issue with this film and that issue is character development; the writers here don't seem to bother fleshing any of the characters out meaning that many characters appear quickly and disappear just as quickly. Surely it would have been a stronger film if both the protagonists and the villains were fleshed out a little more. All of these problems do mean that it is a very hard film to care about while you're watching it.Another jarring thing about this film was the soundtrack which was pumping at 10,000 decibels during every single fight scene. Did the director go to the MTV school of directing? Not only was the soundtrack annoying and unnecessary, but it didn't help that the fight sequences were poorly choreographed and anti-climactic. The fights had no intensity about them and just generally lacked in excitement.The performances in this film were pitiful with the possible exception of Tagawa who was actually quite effective in his role as Shang Tsung.This could have been a film that you could say was so bad it's good, it has the silliness, but it isn't entertaining or exciting enough to work.

As I said before, the best movie that was based on a computer game was Super Mario Bros, and Mortal Kombat does not knock that movie off of its stand.My friend, after seeing it the first time, was surprised that it followed the game so closely (please). Basically it is a movie about a martial arts competition with some guys with funky powers and a plot thrown in. The plot is that the emperor of Outworld wants to conquer Earth, and to do that he must win the Mortal Kombat competition 10 times in a row, and guess what, he was won it nine times in a row so if he wins this time he gets Earth, so three people, Sonja Blade, Liu Kang, and Johnny Kage, join to defeat him.To me Mortal Kombat is a try-hard American movie trying to be a Hong Kong movie. The effects were good, but that is one thing that you expect from American movies, and generally good special effects cover up very bad plots. The movies with bad special effects generally have much better plots, which is why low-budget movies are generally far better, and I look at Doctor Who and Clerks to support me in this argument.The other annoying thing was that the characters had flaws which they had to overcome. The use of flaws is not bad, but when it is you must overcome your weakness to succeed Johnny Kage then it gets a bit pathetic. A real movie which uses flaws has these flaws constantly dragging the character down until a point where if he does win, it is a hollow victory because he has lost so much along the way. This is not such a movie.Simply Mortal Kombat is a try hard movie, and when the sequel hit the screens, it basically passed without a comment.

To conquer the earth, Tsung must win 10 consecutive tournaments &#150; with 9 already under his belt, Lord Rayden of thunder and lightening puts together a group of humans who must defeat Tsung and save the world &#150; Johnny Cage, Sonja Blade and Liu Kang. However the competition is, well, out of this world.Considering the level of many video game conversions this is actually pretty good. Baring in mind that the game never left the fighting arena the makers did quite well to put together 90 minutes that, although not great, actually hangs together as a film. Most of it is fighting but at least it knows it's limitations and stays within them. The fights are all pretty good and are driven by a constant (noisy) soundtrack that isn't as naff as it is the first time you hear it. The plot may be paper thin but it is good enough for Friday night stuff like this!The acting is good while everyone is kicking each other. When they have to speak then it is a little shaky &#150; party due to the actors but mainly due to the cartoon dialogue they are given to deliver, it reminds you that you're watching a video game! Lambert turns up for the money and looks like he isn't taking it that seriously! On the other extreme Tagawa is fully into it and is taking it like it's his drive for an Oscar! He is good value and can do villains in films like this in his sleep. Shou is worthy but lacks character but Ashby and Wilson both make up for this with attitude to spare (even if they aren't that great when not fighting).Overall Anderson did well to make this film enjoyable. It isn't great and you really need to be in the mood for what it is &#150; a silly but fun Friday night film that you need to turn your brain off to enjoy. Fights, fights and more fights &#150; if that's all you want then this will please you. An enjoyable, if inconsequential, video game adaptation.

I just couldn't elaborate further, due to only lasting a very short time before fleeing from this tripe. I can honestly say that the acting was nothing short of atrocious.If you want to get your friends or family out into the fresh air or perhaps participating in healthier activities than sitting in front of the box, put this on.Maybe it's just me, but I lasted all of 11 minutes before fleeing! I had to walk away and go play with the cat! Thankfully, I have a cat, a computer, a good book and umpteen other channels to watch ... anything but this!

Why not make a film based on a video game with an involving storyline , and decent acting and half decent fight scenes with real martial arts stars ? , at least that way you`ll appeal to a wider market . All these things are missing from this film version of MORTAL KOMBAT . In fact it`s so bad that it doesn`t feel like a film based on a computer game but more like aa advert for a  film based on a computer game . Weird huh ?   "}]
