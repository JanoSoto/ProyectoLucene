Do I even have to mention his name?  It seems that even the least-buffiest of film buffs knows who the terrific bad-toothed bug-eyed fellow from so many films is.  But, because I'd rather use his name than refer to him by his facial features, I shall.Steve Buscemi.The man with the perfect comedic timing.  The man who can play ruthless, cruel criminals (Fargo and Reservoir Dogs); nice, loving losers (Trees Lounge, Ghost World); and the man that can even save the worst of Adam Sandler movies from total hell (Mr. Deeds, Big Daddy).As I said, Buscemi (great last name eh?) wrote, directed and starred in Trees Lounge, the story of alcoholic Tommy Basilio (Buscemi), the kind of man that defines loser.  His girlfriend left him for his best friend (Anthony LaPaglia), who's no longer his best friend.  His uncle (Seymour Cassle) just died, and the only way he can work is by taking over the town ice cream truck.  Not only this, but he's constantly finding himself at Trees Lounge, the neighborhood bar, drinking more than he should.Trees Lounge is an ensemble piece of only one.  Buscemi's writing is amazing.  The words flow so well, making this one of the few films that convinces you the characters are completely real.  Every character has their own way, their own style of talking.  Whether it's Mike's (Mark Boone Junior) lazy slurred speech or Debbie's (Chloe Sevigny) Gen-X type rebellious talk.The directing is done quite well too.  The whole feel of the film - even the shade of the screen - is a grayish, tragic one.  He even uses some film tricks he seemed to have picked up from other directors he's worked with.  The unique flashback/video sequence of one of Tommy's relative's parties is reminiscent of Tarantino.  The fast paced scene where Tommy is assaulted by Debbie's father (Daniel Baldwin) reminds me of Robert Rodriguez.And, of course, the acting.  Everyone who's seen a few Buscemi films know that he can bring new (or more) life to a comedic, dramatic, ruthless or just plain weird role.  In this, he blends them all together.  Comedic - when he's trying to convince a cousin that his uncle loved him.  Dramatic - when he's sadly telling his former girlfriend he can change.  Ruthless - when he takes his former best friend's offer a little too far and buys an expensive gift.  Weird - his hilarious impression of Marlon Brando from On the Waterfront.And, just as Buscemi blends his acting talents together he blends every aspect of filmmaking in his control to create a heartfelt dramatic comedy in Trees Lounge, 8.5.

This is a story that is hard to tell, let alone find an audience. Although many can relate with the cast of lost souls hanging out at a bar most of the day, many will not admit to being somewhat connected to any of the characters. Filmed for less that 2 million, this independent, low budget, and somewhat of a masterpiece is brilliant as well as entertaining. Much of the cast has gone on to do other known films. Carol Kane, Mark Boone Junior Steve Buscemi, Bronson Dudley, Anthony LaPaglia and Steve's brother Michael Buscemi star in this Minnie and Moskowitz type story.

Tommy's character, while on the surface, demands both pity and sympathy. It's in his anti-heroic attributes ie. selfishness and callousness, that make the film so human and believable.

But he's got more range than that, as he showed in LIVING IN OBLIVION(1995), and this movie, which he also wrote and directed.  The nice surprise is he also has the makings of a fine writer and director.  There's no real plot here, which undoubtedly will throw some people(and has, if some of the comments are any indication), just observing a certain type of people(working-class and barflies) and how they live their lives.

Meanwhile his ex-best friend is with his ex-girlfriend who may or may not be carrying Tommy's child.  Tommy drifts day to day before finding himself a job and a new friend.This was Buscemi's first attempt as director and is semi-autobiographical in it's plot.  Plot, however is a poor way to describe this film's story.  Rather it is an amusing character piece, following Tommy through his life.  Tommy is likeable but is also selfish, clueless, aimless and friendless.  We like him because he has a good loser-quality to him that brings part sympathy and part empathy.  During the film he hurts many through his selfish actions and his life is consistently aimless and pointless.  However it still manages to be interesting because of Tommy.  Even when I didn't care about him the story had enough good support characters and goings on to keep me interested.Buscemi as actor is just as good &#150; doing a weasely version of himself but managing to keep him just likeable enough to get by.  It something about the way that Tommy clearly hurts himself all the way that makes it hard to dislike him.  The support cast are all very good.  Junior, Kane et al do well as the various barflies while LaPaglia, Bracco, Baldwin, Imperioli, Rogers and Jackson all deliver well on their various roles.  Sevingy is very good again in another sexually laced child role &#150; but I'm glad she's not been typecast too much since Kids.Overall this is plot light but is still interesting, amusing and enjoyable.  Buscemi directs with a light touch and keeps everything light until the sombre final shot.

Totally engrossing, especially to a *cough* former *cough* barfly like myself.

And whether or not a particular project is a hit or a flop, Buscemi is always good, and can always be counted upon to add that extra something to any given film, as he has in `Trees Lounge,' an affecting drama he not only stars in, but with which he makes his debut as a writer/director-- and an impressive debut it is.	Tommy Basilio (Buscemi) is an out-of-work mechanic who lives alone above a bar called Trees Lounge in Long Island, N.Y.  He's more than a bit down on his luck; not only did he lose his job, but his pregnant girlfriend of eight years, Theresa (Elizabeth Bracco) recently dumped him for his former boss, Rob (Anthony LaPaglia).  He wants to pick himself up and get his life back together, but he doesn't seem to know where to start, and the garages to which he's applied for work aren't exactly knocking his door down to hire him.  So he gravitates to the Trees, where he can at least interact with others who seem to be in situations not entirely unlike his own, though at different stages and for different reasons.  But they all have one thing in common-- they're people just trying to get through the day; they're trying to get through life.  If they can only figure it all out.	With this film, Buscemi proves that he is more than just a talented actor, but rather a true artist in every sense of the word, with his chosen medium being film.  He has an eye for detail which complements his insights into human nature and enables him to effectively translate his material to the screen.  His characters are finely drawn and complex, and with each and every one he manages to successfully avoid the stereotypes to which a setting like this could easily lend itself (and no doubt would, in lesser hands).  Even with the minor characters, he succinctly gives you enough of who they are that it allows you to see beneath the surface and know what makes them tick.  And he does it imaginatively-- by filling a room with photographs or items that reflect who a certain person is, for example, or simply by training his camera on someone's face and allowing that extra beat that affords the viewer a telling glimpse of what's hiding behind a character's eyes.  Buscemi has an innate sense of knowing how to convey what he's trying to say, and he does it in a million small and different ways that are subtle and incisive.  Simply put, he knows what works-- including how to get what he wants out of his actors-- and he presents it all with a pace and timing that are right on the mark.	In Tommy, Buscemi creates a character to whom many will be able to relate and identify on any number of different levels.  To say that Tommy is a `loser' would be too much of a simplification, because the character is too complex for that tag alone to be accurate.  Tommy is blue-collar, down on his luck, and like so many people in real life, just can't seem to put it all together, can't figure out how `life' is supposed to work.  And that's what Buscemi conveys so subtly and so well, and it's the key to the success of this character-- it's what makes Tommy believable and real.  Obviously, Buscemi knew exactly what he wanted when he wrote this character, and he puts it across with a brilliant, memorable performance which also demonstrates his ability to star in and carry a movie on his own.  Certainly, he has a wonderful supporting cast that gives him plenty of help, but few character actors have ever been able to step into a lead role with such facility and achieve the level of success Buscemi has here.  And it's work that deserves to be acknowledged.	There are a number of notable supporting performances in this film, as well, beginning with Mark Boone Junior, who as Mike captures the essence of a guy who is successful, but a loser nonetheless; LaPaglia, who gives a solid performance as Rob; Bracco, with a performance that is introspectively revealing; Debi Mazar, who with very little screen time leaves an indelible impression (and her eyes are absolutely mesmerizing); Kevin Corrigan (another of the finest character actors around), as Matthew; and especially Chloe Sevigny, as Debbie, Theresa's mature-beyond-her-years, seventeen-year-old niece.  	Rounding out the ensemble cast are Carol Kane (Connie), Bronson Dudley (Bill), Michael Buscemi (Steve's real life brother, playing Tommy's brother, Raymond), Suzanne Shepherd (Jackie), Rockets Redglare (Stan), Seymour Cassel (Uncle Al), Annette Arnold (Sandy), Michael Imperioli (George), Mimi Rogers (Patty), Daniel Baldwin (Jerry) and Charles Newmark (Puck).  An involving story presented with a rich assortment of memorable, convincing characters, `Trees Lounge' is a drama about life-- about the things going on in your own neighborhood, or downtown or two streets over, no matter where you are in the world.  Wherever people are, there are situations like the ones depicted in this film, problems that have to be solved and life that has to be lived.  And that's what makes this film so good; it gives the audience a chance to connect with, or at least examine, things that anyone anywhere will be able to recognize.  It may have taken a collaborative effort to make this one what it is, but in the end, it's Buscemi's film from start to finish, and a satisfying little gem of a movie it is.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.

This demands the proper mix of compassion and dispassion, which for Buscemi, as for others similarly gifted, leads to an almost inseparable mix of comedy and pathos up is down, down is up.  Buscemi plays himself, or what he probably would have been had he not found his talent in movie making, namely, a loser trapped in a downward spiral of unemployment, drugs, alcohol, and loneliness, familiar ingredients of endless movies, TV docudramas, talk shows, and news, all humbuggery and false preaching; so familiar, in fact, as to pose an American fixation, something we see so much of that we no longer see at all.   He's not afraid to let things get ugly, really ugly, down right squalid. An unemployed, unemployable car mechanic ends up by default driving an ice cream truck through the sun-drenched tree-lined streets of suburbia, a peculiarly American version of hell.    Strange to say, the whole mess is uplifting and absurd; Buscemi loves his characters, warts and all; he warms us to them with a wealth of detail, emerging us in a whole crowd of people, complete with its own history and past, each member whole and completely formed, with hardly a trace of exaggeration or artifact, a false note or cliche.   Because more is at stake--the American dream--this is a better movie than Buscemi's   i Living in Oblivion  (1995), which was about the trials and tribulations of making an independent film on a shoe-string. Because both films are centered on the social life of a bar, comparison to Barbet Schroeder's  i Barfly  is inviting; but the latter's hero is a diamond in the rough, while the one here is just a schmegegge.

It is about a semi-alcoholic (Buscemi)who throws away his life hanging out at a local bar in a small town outside of New York City. I liked the way he was portrayed of being liked and despised at the same time. The main character obviously came from a well established Italian-American family in the community. So, people know and associate with him, but at the same time are wary of him because he appears to be a loser. The main character was once a very good mechanic, but lost his job when he stole money from the garage's till. The owner (Lapaglia) is torn. He is guilt-ridden, because not only did he steal the main character's girlfriend, but also is sorry to see his former friend throwing away his life drinking at the local bar. I also like all the supporting cast. There is a great deal of sorrow displayed in this old man, who is obviously beyond hope. When the old man is finally dying, all the locals who pretended to like him at the bar really are discovered to have not cared at all. The things that detracted from the movie was that the main character was immature and irresponsible. It was hard to empathize with a guy who does drugs and sleeps with a seventeen year old girl. In addition, there was a lot of lack of clarity in the film. Who was the main character in relation to the ice cream man who suddenly died. He is obviously treated like a family member, but no explanation is given as to whom he actually is. If someone just said that is the nephew, it would have resolved a lot of confusion. So, the movie was interesting, but suffered from a lack of empathy for the plight of the main character, and confusion about whom exactly he is.

I had it at the end of a video tape I'd recorded (off IFC) after 'Monument Ave.', a Boston-mob film that had a similar bar tone to it, but was nothing like 'Trees Lounge.' 'Trees' takes place on Long Island and the vast array of crazy characters are a lot to choose from! There's a lot of humor in this film - and a lot of secrets & desires. The lounge is a bar that has a lot of losers who frequent it - the main one being Tommy (Buscemi)! There are the standard barflys who sit there all day drinking, and who must be on a fat social security paycheck to pay for it all! Anyway, we follow Tommy through his break-up with a gal he treated like crap and who has left him for one of his more-stable friends who owns a garage, going to family funerals and getting beaten up by a certain 'guido' in the 'hood. The only thing Tommy has, and the rest of his drinking buddies for that matter, is drinking his blues away. One of the cool people Tommy meets at the Trees is 'Mike', played by Mark Boone Junior - who gives a great performance as a guy who's wife is also threatening to leave him if he doesn't straighten up his act. So Mike & Tommy drink together and at one point, bring home 2 teenage girls to smoke some pot and dance to some records, in a bout of drunken bad judgement. When the wife returns, she asks Tommy if there were any girls there and Tommy, as a pro, covers for his new friend perfectly. There'a also a small part with Debbie Mazar, who Tommy almost gets to take home - until she passes out and her friends tell him to leave her alone! And Carol Kane is wonderful as the feisty bartender who keeps Tommy in line when he needs it. Also look for Kevin Corrigan as a coke-head loser, similar to the one he portrayed in Buffalo '66. By the end of the movie, you really start to feel sorry for Tommy. You wonder how much of it is based on Buscemi's life in New York, before he made it in the business. They say he actually drove an ice cream truck for awhile in NY, so that part must be true. All in all, Buscemi gets totally DICKED OVER in this film. But it is still a great film. And real.

He crafted some genuinely memorable, dare I say classic, performances playing desperate, low people skidding on the bottom of society's hierarchy.Then he made a movie. In Tree's Lounge, Buscemi cleverly uses his familiar role as the down and out bottom-feeder to create a character that effectively draws sympathy instead of parody. Buscemi's movie is about an ordinary loser, but it is told with such striking honesty that it becomes a poignant and absolutely original drama.Recalling the poetry of Charles Bukowski and the music of Tom Waits, Tree's Lounge chronicles the misadventures of someone dwelling in the gallows of society. Buscemi's character Tommy plays a familiar archetype that exists in any town and any family - the stubborn child who always refuses to become a man. His arrested development seems too deeply progressed that any chance of redemption has faded in the past. Tommy isn't a bad guy, but his selfishness and immaturity put him at odds with the rest of the world. The story finds him at a crucial point in his life, where he may have one more opportunity to learn something valuable about living before it's too late. However, Buscemi makes no easy compromises and he smartly values honesty over sympathy. His portrayal of Tommy is truly skillful, because he allows enough subtlety to let the audience care about him and judge him at the same time.I love Tree's Lounge because it tells its sad story with the passion and humor needed to let the audience truly understand its character. Tommy is the kind of guy who hurts everyone around him to the point where they eventually stop giving him opportunities to redeem himself. Chances are, everyone has someone like Tommy in their life who they give up on after awhile. What this movie explains is that some people are too selfish to ever learn the essential things about life, and therefore usually can't ever earn back the trust and loyalty of those they love.

Therefore he lost his love and present, lost having a dream or a tomorrow. At one moment he says Everybody is lost. But nobody says that about himself ! That guy lives above a bar, (and in it !). After 8 years of affair, his girl goes to his boss; who deserves her more, since he achieves himself, and planed his tomorrow. Now we follow the features of that 40 year old teen's aberration; a caprice with a teen girl that equals his adolescence, being too cowered to admit that he's a loser, his torn connections with everybody, his incapacity to have any kind of balanced human relationship.. So that's why he begged a touch of hand from the girl who danced with him (who drunkenly slept before requesting any physical love from her side).The movie managed to embody the statues of some people from that loser town as well; the dancing woman is unhappily married, the company's owner &#x96; who goes constantly to the bar &#x96; is irresponsible towards his wife and kids,.. etc. As you see, everybody is a drunken adolescent who has no hope for getting out of their stalemate or that town, along with those rotten invariable values; such as negativism, laziness and separation, that they imprisoned themselves in.The funniest thing is the lead's transforming at the end to a twin for the old drunken man who used to sit in the bar for all the time like a corpse. It insinuated that he'll meet the same fate; turning into a lonely aged, no talker no listener, frozen sot who Will wake up someday, not breathing ! There are some clever scenes. 2 of them are unforgettable. The first is when the lead's ex-lover was re-watching his old home video. Look how the movie's camera goes beyond the TV's screen, to live the good memories. Maybe because the frivolous past of a character like Tommy is his present and future. Or maybe because these memories have some hot feelings that still alive inside that tape, and that lover who deplores Tommy as lost or determined on being lost.The second scene is when the lead sees his ex-love after giving birth to a baby. He understood there that he can't push the time back to win what he resolved to lose. And that the baby isn't his son; whether due to how he can't give life, even for himself !, or due to the fact that that baby would never have a life under his dead tree. This is surely the best climax for this movie. So when you read the tagline  a story about one man's search... for who knows what., you'll easily understand that his search is for an escape, away from his irresponsible self, or admitting it.I knew (Steve Buscemi) first as an extra in (Pulp Fiction), then as an always scary psychopath killer in movies like (Con Air) and (Some Things to Do in Denver When You Are Dead). To an extent that in 1999, when Empire magazine published a reportage about the best 100 movies in history, the icon that they used to define the degree of bloodiness in every movie was a face so similar to his! So imagine my surprise to witness how he can act, write, and direct something distinct, serene, and not bloody such as this.I just hated the poster's line Black Comedy. Clearly the term Drama is unprofitable or unpopular in America of the last decades ! There was no need for such a lie or for hiring big name like (Samuel L. Jackson) to do a useless cameo either. But these were some ways to market the movie in a market that mostly doesn't welcome anything except the holy  action and comedy flicks ! As a direction it's astonishingly simple and sensitively done. (Buscemi) did it without one second of allegation or exhausting technique. And as a script; it's subtle, bitter and enjoyable study for the anti-hero. In other words, sometimes a short novel bewitches me. Here's one of them.

Tommy's life is a mess. He hangs out at a local Long Island bar, called the Trees Lounge, where he hobnobs with other neighborhood deadbeats.None of the characters here have anything going for them. They drink alcohol, smoke, and talk. They're frustrated, unhappy, angry, and in a lot of emotional pain. Some viewers would call them losers. They don't know how to adapt to life's changes. They can't see beyond the dreary little world they've boxed themselves into. Their perspective is too confining.The best scenes take place inside the bar, where depressing jukebox songs play in the background. Outside the bar, scenes are largely uninteresting and perfunctory. But they do add depth to the characters, if the viewer has any interest in them to begin with. Some scenes play like a soap opera of life's defeated. Pace is slow. Dialogue is voluminous.Superficially, Buscemi, bug-eyed and anemic looking, is something of a trial to watch. Yet, he's no less attractive than other actors here. And that's a welcome change from blow-dried, photogenic fashion models, right out of central casting, who populate so many mainstream films.Low-budget, and very low-concept, Trees Lounge is just the ticket for the viewer who is depressed, bored, or feeling blue. One can empathize with Tommy, or his cohorts, knowing that the story is semi-autobiographical of Buscemi, before he got into acting.

Each cast member should be awarded an Oscar for how real they portray this sad set of characters. Like a step into the daily wrongness of a typical craphole which can be anywhere in the USA, Buscemi's breakout performance as the alcoholic ice cream man captures a rawness of how a man can be degraded so swiftly in the morays and questionable social structures that permeate our culture. Brilliantly written, Buscemi makes the assumption of just how relationships are all based in fear and the fact of this fear is why the characters act out and react as they do throughout this film but as we all do in the real world as well.

No phony props or gussied-up stars need apply for this amazing blend of humor and pathos, centering on Tommy Basilio, a drifting, booze-loving, socially inept, confused 20-something, who is in the throes of a pre mid-life crisis. Steve Buscemi's genius lies his total absorption of the central character and his ability to extract much of the same from his fellow actors. One is totally immersed in the middle class consciousness of this typical Long Island suburb to the point that you actually feel you are watching this happen on a sidewalk in the town, rather than in a theater or on TV. This by no means is a mere comedic foray, as the inherent dysfunctionality of our central character and his immediate world become more evident and problematic as the film develops and the story's flow changes gears to a deeper and more somber tone. It's somewhat reminiscent of a film 30 years prior called Alfie in that each central character has to eventually ask himself What's it all about? But back to the lighter moments, as in the character interaction between Steve B. and Chloe S. from the ice-cream truck to the Munchkin song. The cameo-ish performances of T. Lapaglia, Sam Jackson, etc. really augment the story line impeccably. Samuel Jackson has to crack you up when he says to Tommy's new-found drinking buddy Your wife likes the city because she is a city girl, and you are too!

His writing seems effortless, wry, naturalistic and shy, much like his public persona as a wonderful character actor of our times (character actor meant with the highest regard).  I could comment on the existentialist angle of the characterization of Tommy as a wanderer, that spartan romantic who like a teenager remains in between worlds, in decisionless void of heartbreak and regret.  He is far from a loser, because he is very aware of what he has lost; a loser is moreso lost because he lacks consciousness of his actions and his place.  It's a fairly apt post-modern statement (not to get too highfallutin') on men especially. It is a delight to watch Buschemi at the heart of a very reflective, introspective film surrounded by great moments from Seymour Cassell, Chloe Sevigny, and others.  The only disappointments for me were the overblown displays by LaPaglia, who is usually splendid, and Daniel Baldwin --  the extremely volatile proto-masculine images left impotent among more subtle performances such as Bracco's. I look forward to Buschemi's next written work; this is a really wonderful first go!

In the movies, we usually see this kind of ethnic gathering, here Italian-Americans in the part of Long Island that's just over the border from New York City, at a funeral or wedding, rather than in the every day life of the casual, lazy days of summer when the neighborhood ice cream truck coming down the street is an event.What distinguishes this movie from so many others about losers is that each one here has a moment of recognition about what they're doing, and gets to see themselves as others see them. For a slight story, we do wait in suspense if Buscemi's Tommy in particular will have enough of an epiphany to turn himself around.While the alcoholics among them seem perhaps too comfortably tolerated, our attention is also kept by similar curiosity if their enablers will stop protecting them as they keep sliding backwards. But what happens to both sides in the struggle is handled in an unusual way. Rather than feeling like a tragedy, the sliding and prevaricating is done with love and humor. Even the other bar fly, Mike Boone Junior's Mike, while played for some broad laughs, including his screechy but understandably fed up wife, also has pathos for our sympathy.Uniquely compared to so many other debut films that rely on some semi-autobiographical bases, none of the characters are frustrated artists seeking or getting a big break in Manhattan or out of the neighborhood relationship as a deus ex machine solution. Even the city girl rejecting these suburbs turns out to be from the outer boroughs that are not that different.Very unusual for a film set in this environment, it is very sensitive to the women, who are not stereotypes even though their options aren't much above the wife or the girlfriend or staying with a cousin in the city. They mostly are the ones who have backbone, particularly as they wisely see what is needed to protect themselves and especially their children. There is a lovely scene when Tommys very pregnant ex-girlfriend, by whom she's not really saying, is viewing old home videos of happier times when they were all friends and younger. She's not the only one in tears.Also very refreshing is for a film to recognize that messing about with a pretty 17 year old is not a plus, but a sign that a lonely older guy is avoiding age appropriate women who have given up on him. Chloe Sevigny portrays less a jail-bait temptress handing out sweets than an envious, imitative little sister from a pop song.Mimi Rogers, usually so frostily WASPy, surprisingly does a Long Island accent well enough to believably be the wife of a one-note Daniel Baldwin. Also against type, Carol Kane is not a kook. Debi Mazar has a small but memorable role.Samuel Jackson is in the film for a minute a two, along with Larry Galliard, Jr, pre-The Wire, but well helps to establish a different side of a character who surprisingly turns out not just to be an amusing barfly, but rather a serious alcoholic who has more at stake. Anthony LaPaglia was a lot thinner ten years ago, but is charismatic here and not just the mechanic as lovable lug.The soundtrack selections are a nice blend of bar band classic rock and older tunes.Live Entertainment's 1996 VHS tape seemed to be in blurry EP mode for a 96 minute long film.

Naturally, when I heard he'd directed and written a movie by himself, starring him, I wanted to see it. I found this to be more of a drama than a comedy, but it didn't really bother me. It didn't have much of a plot, but that didn't bother me either. The film is about Tommy(Buscemi) who's an alcoholic. He just lost his job, and his boss took over his pregnant girlfriend. So, what should he do? Going to the local bar is probably low on the list of good ideas, but that's what he does. The plot is almost non-existent... then again, there's plenty of back-story to make up for it, and the movie has a pretty good pace, even though it moves kind of slow. The movie is primarily a study of the environment of alcoholics, and as such, it's great. Just great. There's tons of little details, thrown in here and there that don't really add to the plot, but rather to said study. The acting is mostly great. Buscemi is great, as always, and some of the supporting actors are equally good; Baldwin and Sevigny, in particular. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is a rarity in the film, but it is mainly a drama. Also, what little there is, is great. The environment presented is entirely realistic and accurate. There isn't really anything about it that seemed to just be put in there, everything is perfectly believable. The dialog is well-written. There wasn't a lot I didn't like about this film, apart from the few tell-tale signs of Buscemi's inexperience in the director chair(long takes for no apparent reason, one or two acting performances that are either under- or overdoing it, the occasional odd camera angle), but I can see why many probably won't like it. It's not a fast film, it's not that fun, and the ending doesn't really resolve anything. Everyone is still caught in their respective situations, none of which are satisfactory. No major revelation is made by the end of the film. In the end, Buscemi just makes his point... that the life of an alcoholic is an empty one. Nothing else. Don't rent this to laugh or learn a useful lesson. Rent this to get insight into the day-to-day life of alcoholics and their environment. I recommend this to fans of Steve Buscemi and people who enjoy films that just indulge in study of a certain group of people.

And I say actor, not star, because he has re-defined the true art of divulging into character and literally performing so well we come to believe he is an entirely different person. He also has some of the best lines of all time. (You're acting like a first-year thief; I'm acting like a professional; Whoa, Daddy!; You should see the other guy!)In Trees Lounge, his directorial debut, Buscemi (pronounced Bu-schemy) plays Tommy, a struggling alcoholic living in a pleasant middle-America town. Tommy thrives on the Trees Lounge, a local bar, where he mopes about all day long in self-loathing, hitting on the bartender (Carol Kane) and getting into brawls. His life is an utter waste until he lands a job as an ice cream man and thereby sparks a daring relationship with a 17-year-old girl (Chloe Sevigny). I'd be lying to you if I were to claim that Trees Lounge had a bare minimum of character metamorphosis. Tommy doesn't evolve very much throughout the film - in the beginning and until the very end he remains a miserable soul, unable to decide whether he's unhappy because he's drunk or drunk because he's unhappy. It brings to mind the speech by John Cusack in High Fidelity, or even Mike Myers as Fat Ba$tard in Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me Are they unhappy because of their passion, or vice versa?Trees Lounge is obviously a low budget effort by Buscemi, apparently powered by his own passion towards the project. A lesser actor and director might have turned Trees Lounge into an unfunny bar-based comedy in the vein of Cheers, minus the likable characters and witty one-liners, and presented us with a one-dimensional character who displays all the characteristics of a hero and yet is found sitting in a bar all day long. Almost magically, Buscemi avoids these clichés and reveals a wonderfully wise and observant character study of one man - and although he isn't always the most likable of people, he always manages to remain realistically crafted, and realistically kind - he does things we disapprove of, such as drinking, drugs, etc. Yet we never feel any content towards Tommy. Perhaps because he connects with a vital human element within all of us.Indeed, Buscemi portrays Tommy as a very flawed character, and yet a strangely addictive one. I'm glad the focus of the story wasn't on someone else - out of all of the characters in the film, I liked Tommy the most, perhaps because he is given more depth and focus than the others. But yet I also firmly believe it has something to do with Buscemi's great acting abilities. As a character actor he is superb, and one of the funniest men in Hollywood - despite being what could be considered as a serious actor. When he makes a movie as good as Trees Lounge, it makes you wonder why he feels the need to pop up in all of Adam Sandler's tired vehicles. He's even the highlight in those films.The film has its fair share of cameos, most noticeably by Samuel L. Jackson in a role similar to that he played in Hard Eight. But where the film truly succeeds is not via the surface, but through a much deeper level of realism. We meet people like Tommy a lot. Whether it is drunkards or loafers, they're everywhere. Trees Lounge is disturbingly depressing on a very subtle level because of the way it deals with Tommy. It's hard to truly explain the feelings the film creates without ruining the ending, which I will resist doing. But it's unexpected and somehow very depressing on an unusual level. No stereotypical deaths or such bold turns in the screenplay. It's the subtle stuff that drives Trees Lounge. It has its flaws but it also surpasses movies of its kind on a level that not many manage to do.

Steve Buscemi creates a very interesting study that focuses on how several people surrounding a bar's lives intersect.  It's also nice to see Steve Buscemi in a role where he doesnt play a ruthless bad-ass, but a good natured man.  If you like Steve Buscemi, you should certainly give it a try, it might surprise you. 8/10.

This film tried to be funny and failed miserably at every turn and the story really dragged on at 95 minutes although it felt longer . The characters I couldn't relate to and the relationships between all characters weren't believable . Buscemi has tried to portray himself as the lovable loser and we are meant to laugh at his shortcomings , however I must concede Buscemi is the best character in the film the rest I found irritating .Of course this is merely an opinion and Buscemi fans should give it a watch anyway I just personally never enjoyed it at all .

I missed the first 20 mins of the film, so I'm looking for it it the shops to buy.This film was an excellent watch and Steve Buscemi should be given respect as this is as far as i know was his first film hes directed. Whats really great about this film, is there is no obvious plot it just flows. It is also quite funny but I think its much more of a drama. Samuel L Jackson and Mimi Rodgers also are in this film(probably supporting there friends first directed film). Chloe sevigny who plays debbie in this film offers some sexual tension in an ice cream van with Tommy (Steve Buscemi)that scene stays in the memory and the on screen chemistry between them is great.I'm quite rubbish at writing reviews, but this is good stuff and well worth a watch. ) "},{"Title":"Steve Buscemi's drinking movie","Date":"14 October 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" First of all this isn't a film for your casual movie viewer. You won't see anything like this in a theatre, or at least not a theatre looking to make money. It's a story written intelligently around the down and out lives of drinkers and smokers of a small town in New York.There are very funny parts and depressing parts but Steve Buscemi manages to blend the two very well. This is aided wonderfully by absolutely perfect acting from the main cast, especially the always wonderful Buscemi who also starred in the film as Tommy Basilio.Tommy is an auto mechanic who has been recently fired by his boss, his boss also being the one who stole his pregnant girlfriend. Ironically the bosses name is Rob played by Anthony LaPaglia. Now Tommy spends most of his time in the Trees Lounge bar where he encounters and helps many interesting characters. After his Uncle Al dies he takes over his ice cream truck, albeit unsuccessfully which leads him to trouble when he gets involved with a very young Debbie played by Chloe Sevigny in her first role after Kids. In the end Tommy Basilio learns a lot about himself and life in general and has a wild time doing so.This interesting independent film is a must see for hardcore Soprano fans, Indie film fans and drama lovers in general. This movie makes up for its leisurely pace with wonderful acting, script and direction. This film also has a great theme song performed by Hayden appropriately named Trees Lounge.8/10 "},{"Title":"I didn't like it","Date":"27 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Tommy is an unemployed mechanic who had a problem on his last job and can't seem to get another job until he finally gets to run an ice cream truck.  He also might have gotten another man's wife pregnant.  Other than that, I can only say that this movie was about the people who hang out at a bar called Trees Lounge.  I did like the scenes with Tommy and Debbie.  Other than that, two scenes had promise  one with an old man in an ice cream truck with lots of children around, and one with Samuel L. Jackson.  Unfortunately, Jackson wasn't around long, and the ice cream truck scene didn't lead to anything positive.There was some good music, specifically old-style jazz.  Unfortunately, there was a lot of music I didn't like.I guess there are people who would like this.  I just wasn't one of them.

He then inherits an ice cream van from his deceased uncle and drives around the streets half-bored selling sweets.This is a perfect example that illustrates good actors don't necessarily make good films! The characters are weak, the story told a thousand times before and the complete luck of active plot makes the film suitable only for TV on a Sunday afternoon. Buscemi fails to push the actors to their limits resulting in a 'soap opera' style performance which is well below the average. Most of the scenes were pointless and contributed nothing to the film.Trees Lounge could have started straight after Tommy inherited the Van (thirty minutes before the end) and still wouldn't make any difference! If you do end up watching the film just imagine how the film would be like if Tarantino directed it.Better watch TV commercials ( "}{"Title":"This movie is horrible...its dreck !","Date":"12 March 2002","Score":"8 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  It's really unbelievable how bad this movie is.

It`s a really low concept ( ie character based story ) movie where not much happens .

MILD SPOILERS !!!!I should perhaps also give some praise to Buscemi for writing a screenplay with an obvious subtext of never getting what you want  Tommy want`s to snort yet more drugs but someone comes into the bathroom , Tommy wants to take a woman he`s picked up in a bar but she falls asleep while he`s in the bathroom , a young kid wants to buy an ice cream but the ice cream man suddenly has a heart attack , so the theme to this movie is very clear .
