It shows that there is always something worth living for and that life goes on even though it may seem at times that there is nothing left to live for. (spoilers) This film was all one man's story of how he dealt with having a broken heart, and how he recovered. It is an autobiography by Mario, the main character, who tells the story himself, which is made clear in the first few minutes of the film. Mario returns to find Laura, his ex, getting the last of her things, and he begs her to come back to him but she is happy living with another man. The dancing scenes in the film seem to show a way that Mario tries to escape from his emotions, but it backfires because he sees Laura there dancing with the man that she left him for. Whenever he sees her, everything else that is going on in the movie stops abruptly. There is nothing but the music, the dancing, and Mario's mesmerized stare. He seems to be in a trance every time he sees her, and he even has murderous visions. His mind seems to be so choked with emotional turmoil that he cannot function when he is in her presence, he is absolutely captivated by her.When Mario finally meets another woman, it is a result of her dancing ability. In fact, the first thing that is spoken of her in the film is about her exceptional dancing skill. This is very effective because from this point on, she is seen as being superior to all of the other women, and she is focused on when she is in a large group, which makes Mario's romance with her more moving. She represents a new beginning for Mario, and she makes him forget about Laura, which is all he seems to want up to this point in the film. There was one very quick scene worth noting because it is an exact example of what the film is about. Mario is at a dancing school where there is a classroom of young students learning to tango, and he is speaking with an elderly man. The man tells him that his wife recently passed away, and his life no longer has any meaning, he has nothing left. As soon as he finishes saying this, he looks across the room and his face breaks into a wide grin as he points his granddaughter out to Mario, claiming her to be the `best in the class.' This is a perfect example of the meaning of this movie! The moment after this man tells Mario that his life is meaningless because his wife passed away, he lovingly boasts the dancing skill of his granddaughter. His life obviously still has meaning because, even though his wife is gone, he can still watch this girl grow as both a person as well as a dancer. I hope Mario noticed this man's glaring miscalculation of the importance of his own being. The surprisingly ironic ending of the film represented the fact that life goes on, and also that sometimes it is really necessary to end some relationships in order to be happy, even if it seems like the end of the world. Mario is very happy with this woman that he met, but in order for her to be with him, she had to break a man's heart just the same way as Laura had broken his. That man's heart was broken the very same way that Mario's was broken at the beginning of the film, which is very ironic because this man is in the exact same position that Mario was in after Laura left him earlier in the movie.The title of this film refers not to a particular style of dancing, but to the emotional tango that people can dance with each other. Even though dancing is abundant throughout the film, it's not actually ABOUT dancing. However, the dancing did tie everything in the film together.Another element that is particularly interesting is the way the camera is used. This is the first film I have ever seen that actually seemed to give the camera itself a bit of personality. In the second half of the film, the director did not seem to make the slightest effort to avoid filming the camera's reflection. There was even one scene where the camera was looking directly at itself in a mirror, which for some reason I find fascinating. I think that this was supposed to suggest that all of the dancing that went on in the film was all rehearsal for a play or some sort of live presentation, rather than people acting for the movie itself. This gives you a whole different perspective and, ironically enough, it makes the film seem even more realistic.

When the major investor Angelo Larroca (Juan Luis Galiardo) asks for an audition for his lover Elena Flores (Mía Maestro), she succeeds and participates in the play; however, Mario falls in love for her and Elena fears the dangerous Angelo.I saw Tango for the first time on 01 January 2001; I have just watched it again and I still believe it is one of the most wonderful tributes to the tango. Carlos Saura uses the concept that history is indestructible and recalls the dark years of military dictatorship in Argentina after the amnesty entwined with a passionate love of a middle-aged man for a young woman to build the plot, supported by stunning cast, choreography, music score and lighting. However, the conclusion is confused and disappointing, and I really do not understand the relationship of Angelo and Mario acting like pals in the last scene. Cecilia Narova and Mía Maestro are extremely beautiful and fantastic dancers, and I do not get tired of seeing them dancing tango.

Brown. The tune is a famous one, La Cumparasita or something like that, turned into an American pop song in the 1950s with English lyrics and named Strange Sensations. Anyway, the dance is played for laughs. Well, it's understandable. The conventions of the tango seem so automated to someone used to other forms. But what surprised me here was the flexibility of the form, the way it is adapted to circumstances. There is, of course, a number here in which two or three dancers express intense passion, the emotion we usually associate with the tango. But there is also a number that is informed by humor. Suarez, who is about to direct a show featuring the tango, native to Argentina, is alone in his studio, talking to himself about the folly of falling in love, and he imagines a scene in which the silhouettes of two dancers perform a comic number, waggling their bottoms at the camera, the music bumping along in the background featuring a few strings and a flatulating tuba, itself an amusing instrument in sound and appearance. Thank you for that tuba, Lalo Schifrin. As an Hispanic himself, Schifrin knows what he's doing. (He makes good use of the bandoneon, a kind of concertina, too.) There is a less-successful number that uses boots and military uniforms in an evocation of the period in the 1970s and 1980s when citizens of Argentina were disappeared. There are tango-tinged encounters between men and others involving women, that are homosexual in effect. And sometimes there is no music behind the dances at all -- only the natural sounds of clothing rustling and soles squeaking on the wooden floor as the performers twist and turn. Let me get back to that homosexual dance between the two women. One of them, if I got it right, is Suarez's ex wife, a superb dancer played by Cecilia Narova. The younger one is played by Mia Maestro. The dance ends with a sensuous kiss, and I can understand why another woman might want to kiss Maestro. I could understand it even if some twisted extraterrestrial whose native notion of esthetic perfection looked like the inside of an alarm clock wanted to kiss Maestro. She is egregiously beautiful, two-thirds Diane Venora and one third Audrey Hepburn, and sports what must be, even to the most jaded eye, a nearly perfect body whose movements are entirely under her own control. Her high kicks beat those of Eleanor Powell. And when her numbers freeze in tableaux, it would be perfectly okay if she just retained those balletic poses for, oh, say five or six minutes so we can burn the images into our brains. I don't think the human form and the suppleness of which it is capable has ever been displayed more elegantly. Not to put down Fred and Ginger. That's a different ballroom game.The Spanish as spoken is appropriately Argentinian too, for what it's worth. The pronunciation is regional and so is the grammar. I say this out of complete ignorance of the language except for that which comparative linguists tell us. And a chat buddy in Buenos Aires. (Besos a vos, mi compaera).The plot is nothing much. Abstract and arty and colorful. Saura's 8 1/2. Suarez, the benign director of a musical show, falls for Maestro. She is living with a Mafioso who is a dangerous dude, sub specie aeternitatus. But she tells the Mafioso off anyway and stalks off as he shouts after her -- You're making a big mistake. If it did turn out to be a mistake we don't learn about it. The movie ends happily if trickily.I want to emphasize that the dances are just about everything here. They bear about the same relationship to Lemon and Brown's tango as Fred and Ginger's superbly rehearsed dances do to the twist. There is one number by Maestro in which she does nothing but walk around slowly and strike an occasional pose. It's stunning in it simplicity and sensuousness. And in the duets, the dancers hold each other so close through so many acrobatic movements that, without stretching too much, I can imagine one false step bringing them tumbling to the floor wrapped up in each other.The photography and lighting (by Vittorio Storaro) is superlative and the art direction equally so. Everything takes place in a carefully designed studio with mirrors and stages and painted backdrops scattered around. Sometimes we don't know if we're looking into a mirror or seeing the real scene. Nor can we always be sure that what we're watching is taking place in real life or in Suarez's imagination -- sometimes the imaginary turns into the real. But none of this detracts from our understanding of the film. The double structure is not simple directorial self display, nor is it just more hokum about what's reality and what's illusion?. It adds visual texture to a film that already has more than a dozen Hollywood monstrosities could hold. It's really art, without quotation marks around it.

Similar to their last joint effort  'Flamenco', 'Tango' is both an examination of the music and dance of the tango and, more importantly, it's role as a reflection of the human condition.  Saura and Storaro have gathered these elements and taken them, and the audience, one step further.

As he did in Carmen, Carlos Saura invites us into a beautifully crafted melange of realism, impressionism, and surrealism to express the human emotions of love, betrayal, jealousy, fear and redemption. His melange results in a film that is an enigma wrapped in the sensuality, color and passion of a tensive tango that expresses his horror at the atrocities of Argentina's Dirty War. This film is as much a political statement as it is a well-crafted masterpiece of cinematic art, color and music. In Carmen we never know when Antonio's real relationship with Carmen ends and the flamenco drama begins. So too, in Tango, Saura sucks us into a reality carefully created to deceive us while at the same time it teaches us in colorful shades the subtle and sometimes unnoticeable differences between illusion and reality. Until the end of the film the viewer actually believes that Mario has lost Laura and found himself again in his love for Elena, who he suspects will be murdered by one of LaRocca's henchmen. Saura films the scenes with Elena and Mario at the restaurant and in the bedroom in a colorless reality that assures us that this is a real relationship. Thanks to set designer, Waldo Norman (Ricardo Mourelle), Mario is able to travel between time and space through color, particularly shades of red, giving the dream sequence in which he kills Laura a surreal affect. The devils of Mario's surrealistic subconscious are exorcised again in the graphic choreography of the torture and rape scenes depicting the Dirty War against liberals, students, artists, union workers, and intellectuals. In their acrobatic bends, twists and rolls, the dancers give us the impression of intense pain at the hands of their cruel torturers. Perhaps this surreal dance is the only way that Mario, and Saura, can deal with the horrific atrocities inflicted on the thousands of Argentine desaparecidos (the disappeared ones) from 1976 &#x96; 1983. Mario says as much in the bedroom scene with Elena. While holding her in his arms, Mario states that imagination is the only guardrail that keeps us from plummeting into the depths of horror and atrocity. It is after this scene that the Repression Tango, Saura's balletic version of the horrors of the Dirty War take place. Having experienced a choreographed impression of Hell, the viewer is jolted back to reality in the end, when Elena awakens from death to ask if she had played the scene of her murder well. The lights are on and the stage is bustling with actors and stage techs. Mario with his arms around Elena seemingly incredulous at her resurrection, realizes that he too for a moment was sucked into the artist's illusion, but now stands redeemed through art in a reality free of his inner-most demons.

It could have gone down different paths. It started in the hands of its engineers as simple novelty, quickly abandoned - it seemed there was nothing left to discover. Men from the theater saw it as an opportunity to construct a stage and dazzle with effects. People wanted to be told stories though, deep stories about life, and there was money to be made, so that's where it swung to. We lucked out because erudite minds who wanted to work in the new canvas had to puzzle about how it all amounted to a sort of life, create their paintings or music or philosophy in the midst of life. Film as a language would have been tremendously impoverished without this limitation, which is the same one we encounter in life there is painting or dance only for someone whose senses they strike with curiosity or desire, who has a past and future life that they enliven, in other words a narrative.So we have here a triumph of this language in its struggle to deliver a richer life than usual.It is about dance, wonderful tango. But it can't be just filmed dance, dance itself is more than bodies to music. It is about desire, age, creativity, passion, loss, meaning; all the great dilemmas of life. But they have to be uncovered as life so there needs to be a narrative framework. We want in both cases to find human subjectivity in the dancefloor of its taking shape.The story around these things is about a director who puzzles about a new show and passion in his life. It starts with him on his desk narrating the film we see. It's followed by a hallucination of a male and female pair dancing in a dark soundstage, an old flame we have just seen walk out of his life and her new man. We have some obvious parallels of course his eye as the camera, his face superimposed on narrative walls. So the point is that when we return to the soundstage the space is already charged with dimensions of memory and mind, internal space where the urges first come to life.The space itself is marvelous and provides endless opportunities to create mind blank or colored walls, slides and movie clips, painted skies where figures of history emerge from, endless rows of mirrors. We have of course the filmmaker as the protagonist ruminating on lost friends, cruel politics, senseless war and duty to memory. It's his show after all, the broader film, his space of expression. What's so marvelous though is the conflation of inner life into dance. Desire as seeing and settling on her face among many. Couples dancing. Choreographed order. Piercing gazes locked together in tango. A tension that is both affected and yet real just then. Something inscrutable in the air that can only maybe danced out and never quite figured out more. Dance as looking for union.All through the film we see the show take shape, the slow process. In one particularly evocative scene he blows air into empty dresses and this comes alive as inspiration, and this is followed by her stepping out from behind canvas screens to meet him. Soon there's danger that is foreshadowed for the end, an old boyfriend with possibly mob ties who is also funding the show, his heartbreak and loss mirroring the narrator's.So the violence bubbling in the narrator has been merely postponed, what's the resolution?It ends with the lovers' duel sublimated on the stage between dancers, this was a pivotal scene in one of Saura's previous dance films (flamengo there). The whole scene is a masterstroke. The key players looking, immersed, affected. An implicit tension that may be just the show. The dance ending with a knife's flash. The scorned man gets up and yells as if having her stabbed was a thought or an urge that he regretted only too late. (Saura could have made it more clear that the dancer who stabs her was also one of the funder's men, earlier he is seen escorting the girl to a car that has come to pick her up). At this point it may seem like a trivial setup reality shown to be fiction.But the point is, as all of them walk out of the stage together, reconciled, enthusiastic, casually exchanging words, that all this emotional drama and hurt that was foreshadowed is seen with more distance to be a trivial fiction, an appearance on a stage, an illusion. Wonderful Spanish sensibility.The last shot in context is one of the greatest I've seen, a Marienbad tracking shot through empty space towards glass, tentative reflection that engulfs our vision. Storraro excels all through the film, but here he surpasses himself. It's seen here as clearly as anywhere else that the film is in the company of Resnais, not Bob Fosse.Something to meditate upon.

To bring it all together and make it personal, the through-line concerns a film director's budding romance with a young dancer he has discovered following his traumatic split with a legendary dancer. But that's one element of the film only, and not necessarily its most important element. The film tells us of Argentine history, the prevalence, and even the reemergence of its archetypal themes through the generations, romance, passion, freedom, repression, violence, hope--all told in the language of the tango.The cinematography is first-rate, the overlapping narrative elements (the love story, the story of film-making and its struggles, the story of Argentina in the 20th century, and the story of dance itself) is engaging. But the real reason to see this film is the dancing, which is quite simply stunning. Among the cast are dancers legendary not only in Argentina, but across the world. Mia Maestro, who plays the young up-and-coming dancer, has the exhilarating but probably terrifying job of dancing among all these professionals. While her own dance training is not as extensive as the men and women she dances with, however, she does a really wonderful job in her own dancing scenes--and only someone with significant dance experience will be able to spot the differences between her and the professional dancers.In some ways, though, even these differences make sense in the context of the story. Elena is the young dancer, and part of the drama that Saura presents is her own evolution in the tango. As she learns more, she becomes more alive to her history and her identity. Her dancing deepens throughout the film.And if you don't want to learn to dance the Argentine tango after you have seen this film, then you have no soul. Many thumbs up!

This film has weaknesses, but the ambition is so grand one can forgive, at least in deciding to watch.The general problem is mixing film and dance. Rarely, oh so rarely is it done well. The stock choices are two either film a dance more or less as an audience would see it, or to incorporate dance into the theatric presentation as a device. Either way, the audience is necessarily at a distance. And that's the problem dance is human, to watch it (I'm talking about a performance here) you intimately participate in the space built and folded by the dancers. So by definition, most film/dance mixtures turn flat.The solution here is to create an openly recursive storyline, mixing the dance as sometimes a filmed performance or rehearsal, sometimes real life, sometimes dreams or visions or imaginings. This combined with a never-rooted camera -- which sometimes plays the role of a character itself -- makes the audience part of the dance, and adds depth. The sets are designed to confuse sloped floors, mirrors (used liberally) distortion, translucent screens and so on, further breaking the performance mold. On these terms alone, this is an intelligently conceived film.I cannot say the same for the dancing proper. I think the film suffers from sticking too close to an Argentine palette, so the music and dance lacked breadth, and ultimately became repetitive. Whether the dancers were authentic, I cannot say. There certainly were exciting moments for me, but the dancing wasn't sufficiently vibrant to carry all of the scenes.The Latin flavor was intriguing in the large that the director would attempt such a self-referential conflation national horror; angst of aging; layering of creation. Such a project would be considered outrageous in the US long before it is explored. And the Latin character was also interesting in the small bigbottomed dancers and dumb, dependent women talking about how intelligent and independent they are.Check this out.

In each film there are several levels of reality which inter-tangle making sometimes hard to distinguish if in a given moment an actor is talking/acting as an individual or as the character who the actor represents in the production. The resulting ambiguity (not always clarified by Saura) is then part of the understanding of Saura's work. Although other sources of inspiration are possible, Saura' technique may have been influenced by Luis Bunuel and other surrealists who also like to present confusing levels of reality, like the world or reality/dreams/daydreaming/fantasy/flashbacks of Bunuel's Belle de Jour or dream /reality in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. Let's remember that Saura admired the works of Bunuel, who as a good surrealist (and Freud follower) refused to admit that there are limits and borderlines between the different levels or layers of reality. In Tango Saura has replaced the flamenco dancing of the trilogy with tangos and milongas to present us the multilayered world of a film production based on those Argentinean dances. The plot and character development are secondary (and surely perceived as weak and schematic)since the main efforts are centered in the production of elaborate dance sequences. Instead of the average, aging tango dancers preferred in the Broadway production Tango Argentino, Saura has opted for using in his film stars and good-looking performers who in their majority have extensive ballet training. The main exceptions are the performances by Maestro Juan Carlos Copes (Carlos Nebbia), who in the milonga (dancing hall) and in his interpretation of La Cumparsita provides a tango dancing which will surely please even the most refined tango aficionado. Some other sequences will be controversial to the tango connoisseur, like the lesbian tango and the male homosexual production number so expertly choreographed and performed by ballet star Julio Bocca. Other sequences are already presented in the film as controversial, like the desaparecidos dance sequence which offends some of the film producers. Like in Saura's trilogy, the dance sequences in Tango will please the dance fanatic, but will seem somewhat long and tedious to the average viewer. Everybody will agree, however, in the exquisite technique of the main dancers, especially Mia Maestro and Cecilia Narova, as well as in the solid acting performance by Miguel Angel Sola as the troubled director. In all, a serious and professional effort by Saura that surely deserves its Oscar nomination as Best Foreign Film and the many other international awards which have already received and will continue to receive in the near future.

If we add that Francisco de Goya was also Aragonese and the singer Miguel Fleta also hailed from the Pyrenean province of Huesca, it should be clear that this region has produced some artistically important people, not forgetting historical personages like Catherine of Aragón who had her head lopped off in the court of Henry VIII.The Buñuel-Saura tandem has produced some magnificent cinema, and it is Buñuel's surrealism which Saura frequently echoes, albeit using more modern techniques and technology. Whereas his films `Goya en Burdeos' (1999) and `Pajarico' (1997) (qv) have evidently more tangible story-lines to follow, `Sevillanas' (1992) (qv), `Marathon' (1992) and `Flamenco' (1995) are more documental, but not lacking in cinematographic effects by such geniuses as Vittorio Storaro and Javier Aguirresarobe. However, in Tango the matter becomes more complicated, as, supposedly, anyway, there is, or so we are to understand, a story-line to follow. The story is not clear perhaps it was Saura's intention that each one of us should make up our own story! Better forget the story, whatever it might be, and concentrate on the visual aspects, as they are stunning. Firstly it is a kind of investigation into the art and philosophy of the afamed Argentinian Tango; secondly it an interesting musical appreciation, as most certainly Lalo Schifrin has done his homework, and the music that is not his &#150; and there is quite a lot &#150; has been wisely chosen, including even an extract from Verdi; thirdly the camerawork is of the finest to be seen. Storaro has played with luminosity, playing orange against yellow, magenta against purple, as well as using reflections in mirrors and glass panelling to tremendous effect.In `Tango' Saura once again used music, as in `Sevillanas', `Flamenco' and to a certain degree in `Marathon' as the vehicle for transporting his visual concepts. The result in `Tango' as well as in `Marathon', is quite extraordinary, captivating, and, whether you are a great enthusiast of sevillanas, flamenco or tango or not &#150; I am not &#150; you cannot help but being satisfied by the result, though perhaps not so much in `Sevillanas' as it is a rather overhurried cursory glimpse at a subject matter which should have deserved more time.

Of course, there are exceptions like the wonderful Japanese films, Shall We Dance (1996). But in general, a film devoted to a subject like the Tango is a very, very difficult sell to me. The only reason I watched it was because it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Picture. Otherwise, I doubt if I would have ever gotten around to seeing it. So please keep this is mind as you read--I am not a dance lover.This Argentinian film is about the production of a film devoted to Tango. It is shown from the viewpoint of the director and follows his ups and downs in his personal life as well. A couple HUGE complications arise when the director falls for his main backer's girlfriend--and the backer is a mobster. And, it gets worse because he wants to make a political statement in the film and it also upsets the backers.If all this sounds really exciting, it is....if you adore Tango. As for me, I just felt bored...very, very bored. About the only really nice part of the film was some of the camera-work--the lighting and angles were lovely. Not a bad film but also not a film the average person would enjoy.

We are given the impression, or rather we are told, that Mario must be careful as her lover is a dangerous gangster. This is an attempt to create a dramatic counterpoint to Saura's exploration of different aspects of the tango myth - passion, violence, nostalgia and the mirror of the Argentine national psyche. Sadly the drama succumbs to these other intentions and the movie stumbles more or less confusingly from dance to dance. Characters hover uncomfortably between real humanity and symbolism and fail in both respects. As a consequence, the big themes are merely referred to rather than explored - and the gangster's threat fizzles. This leaves us with the music and (some of) the dancing. We are given a fair sample of tango music. Some of the best is non-dance tango music; highlights are Adriana Varela singing 'Quien hubiera dicho', Horacio Salgan playing 'A Fuego Lento' and tantalising snippets of Gardel singing 'Arrabal Amargo' and Tita Merello singing 'Se dice de mi'. There are also some fine stage tango pieces; such as the ensemble piece with the male dancers. However for me, the most compelling moment is when Carlos Nebbia (Juan Carlos Copes - why did they bother with the alias?) selects an anonymous young woman from the crowd at Confiteria Ideal and they dance to Pugliese's 'Recuerdo'. (In fact, the centrality of Copes to the movie reveals what this movie really is; an attempt to turn a Copes stage show into a movie. I suspect that this movie might have been more successful if they had stuck to that more modest intention.) However I must confess that my criticisms do lay me open to a charge of gross ingratitude. Four years ago, I knew nothing of the tango beyond the dumbest clichés. I had never heard of Pugliese or Copes or Pugliese or Gardel. Then one Sunday evening in March 2004, my wife and I watched this movie. Inspired, primarily by that 'Recuerdo', we took our first tango lesson three days later. There have been some days since when we haven't danced a tango but there cannot have been many when we didn't listen to tango music. Or read about tango. Or watched tango DVDs or YouTube clips.In sum, although I have seen many, many better movies than Carlos Saura's 'Tango', I cannot think of any other movie that has had so much impact on my life.

This 1998 film, in spite of its best intentions, feels flat, even to the unexperienced eye.To make matters worse, Carlos Saura wrote a screen play that feels empty. Not even some of the inspired dance numbers lift this movie from the plot the director wrote. The story behind the film seems false from the start. It doesn't help that most of it seems superficial and contrived. The way the film was filmed, feels claustrophobic since it all takes place in as studio set. The film would have been more enjoyable if Mr. Saura had opened the film and brought it out to the districts of Buenos Aires where the tango reigns supreme.Miguel Angel Sola, a good actor from Argentina, is seen as Mario, Mr. Saura's alter ego, perhaps, since he plays the director of the film going to production. Cecilia Narova, Mia Maestro, Sandra Ballesteros, Juan Luis Galiardo are seen in supporting roles. Juan Carlos Copes, a great dancer of the tango is seen in the film, as well as Julio Bocca, one of the best classical dancers from that country.

There are even, on occasions, films which are truly idiotic.  What is surprising is when an acclaimed art-house Oscar-nominated hit directed by a renowned auteur turns out to be so... stupid.There are three basic problems with this movie.  Firstly, the film is supposed to be about dance - a magical, delicate, abstract art form, capable of great emotional truth, and offering an enviable access to our subconscious.  Here, the many tango scenes are filmed with the flattest of feet.  Saura's reputation largely rests on his innovaations with dance and film.  I haven't seen these, so I cannot comment, but here his direction is so lifeless, uninspired, theatrical and, the worst crime, literal.  Any time a dance threatens to burst into flight, it is weighed down by Saura's rigid framing and editing, and by his need to confer it with deadly significance.If you've seen The Red Shoes - a film in which the form itself actually dances - you will only be insulted by this film.  The great musical directors - Lubitsch, Minnelli, Donen, Demy - have all used the genre to express the profoundest emotional realism.  Middle-aged naval-gazing is not an emotion.Secondly, the plot.  it is a cliche in talking about dance or musical films that, while the set-pieces might be extraordinary, the plot's a joke.  But here the set-pieces are so ham-fisted, that the grotty story draws embarrassed attention to itself.  Saura knows even less about people than George Lucas, and his childish attempts at self-reflexivity mock truly great, inquiring artists.  Any time Saura's tawdry characters fail to excite passion, or any kind of feeling, he piles on the masters - Borges, Goya, Verdi - and claims their power as his own.But the real crassness is the politics.  Essentially another update of 8 1/2 (without Fellini's insight, storytelling nous, visual eye, absurd humour and Marcello Mastroianni) - a middle-aged artist inflicts his impotence (he limps with a cane), anxieties, past failures, political guilt, and desires (there's nothing like a European auteur for embarrassing wish fulfilment); the film suddenly invokes the terrors of the Argentinian junta to bestow upon this creep a soul.  In a ghastly lapse of taste even Mel Brooks might reconsider, these vicious fascist crimes are turned into a musical number, except, unlike the Producers, this isn't satire.  If that's not bad enough, the trick ending adds contemptuous insult to talentless injury.  Every wrong-headed accusation hurled at the mighty Life Is Beautiful is spot on here.The film's only saving grace, and which makes it a masterpiece if you close your eyes, is Lalo Schifrin's astonishing score.  Although old-fashioned, it gives the film an energy and human drive absent in the mise-en-scene. Schifrin forsakes hazy Hispanic stereotypical exoticism in favour of a cool, sophisticated palette of the most astonishing emotional variety.  The only scenes with any life in them are those showing the musicians at work, although that is typical of Saura's directorial vanity.  Dump the film, buy the CD instead.
