Sometimes it pays off spectacularly (Nashville); sometimes it flatters to deceive (Short Cuts).It works well here due to the necessary discipline of the single location and the greater opportunities for interaction among the characters this affords. Add to that an exemplary cast of (mostly) British character actors and a knowing script by Julian Fellowes that gives Altman's keenly observant camera plenty of time to make its own points.Rightly, Altman is less concerned with the murder mystery, which is almost an aside, than with the opportunity given by a shooting party at a 1930s stately mansion to observe the English aristocracy and their servants in social interaction.Never happier than when involved in a bit of human anthropology, Altman lightly dissects the complexities and hierarchies which go on both above and below stairs; in which many subtle and unsubtle rituals are played out among groups of people who clearly dislike each other but are forced through circumstance, need or employment to observe the fundamental social practices required.1932 is also a time of intruding change into the nature of the old English ruling classes, slowly disintegrating in this between-wars period and, in this case, largely reliant on the wealth of one particularly reluctant patron to keep them in furs and flunkies. In on this act comes the (to them) faintly odious whiff of 20th century new money, represented by Hollywood and popular culture. These intruders are kept in their place, but the message is clear - change is coming, and coming fast.The muted colours and autumnal setting continue this theme of a world in terminal decline and of a group of characters keenly conscious of place and tradition yet also wearied and exhausted by it. Only at the very end, when fundamental change has occurred and many characters are left to face up to very different destinies do we see a bit of sunshine creeping in, heralding the dawn of a new era.The cast are all excellent, with special mention deserving of Maggie Smith's effortless scene stealing as a bitchy but broke old Countess; the ever reliable Jeremy Northam as matinee idol Ivor Novello, well aware of his place in the great scheme of things and young Kelly Macdonald in the pivotal role of Smith's harassed maid who's inquisitiveness rattles a whole load of family skeletons.

If viewers think that Gosford Park is boring or confusing or even the worst movie ever, it may be that you're not willing to see what really is portrayed the authenticity and its story. The authenticity of Gosford Park is as close as it can get to real life as it was back then as it can get. Experts who were maids, butlers, or cooks themselves were constantly at the scene criticizing the actors behavior and moves. Another main focus is the story behind it. The brilliant story as well as excellent character development are like no other only Robert Altman could do a film such as this.

In Gosford Park, Altman makes only two changes to this formula Hollywood stars are replaced by Top British talent that may be unfamiliar to most American audiences, and a straightforward murder mystery supplants his traditionally complicated plot line. It is in these changes, however, where Altman charms his audiences in a new way. The story takes place in 1932 at a gathering of aristocrats and their servants for a hunting country weekend at the estate of Sir William McCordle. Some time after all the guests are settled in and whose affairs begin to intertwine, one of them is bumped off. While all the characters are well fleshed out, it's Mary, played by Kelly Macdonald, who is the focus of the drama. She's the maid of Maggie Smith's Countess Constance of Trentham, and is being groomed to follow a path to become head servant. After the murder takes place, emotions unfold and secrets from the past are revealed that help the characters - and the audience - solve the mystery. The drama is even more punctuated when Mary's innocence and naivet√© is lost as she pieces together the deeper scandal, involving servant-master sexual relations and bastard children.One of the best aspects of film is how it illustrates that fine line dividing the master-servant social structures, and how often that line is crossed, reminding us that life is just a game of costumes and masks, and we're all the same underneath. While the story was reminiscent of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians, where it's the mystery that captivates the audience, Altman goes beyond the mystery with Gosford Park by using the murder as a vehicle to draw attention to the human condition and class hierarchy.On the downside, but to no surprise to fans of Altman's work, the movie is often hard to follow. His style of filmmaking involves entanglements of characters and subplots that don't appear to have much to do with one another at first blush, and Gosford Park takes this to the next level. Here, the murder takes place at the climax of this confusion, leaving you rather disoriented in the middle of the 2-hour-plus drama. Fortunately, the tone loosens up when a comedy-dim police inspector basically gets nowhere in his investigation, but the pieces start coming together through the other characters. The good news is that it all seems to come together in the end in a way that didn't require grasping every detail of every scene.Despite its intricacies and confusing moments, there is so much more to Gosford Park that makes it interesting and enchanting. While it is clearly a sophisticated piece of film work with impeccable acting, directing and design, don't stress about not keeping up with it all the time. Sit back and take it in, and you'll feel satisfied in the end.

Director Robert Altman once again takes the Hollywood formula and gives a unique twist.  The story begins when aristocrats during 1932 gather at Sir William McCordle's (Michael Gambon) estate for a shooting party.  The guests are wealthy people with their trusty servants.  People arrive at the McCordle estate two by two and the traditions begin.  The servants set up dinner for their masters and the aristocrats begin their personal routines. The story moves on as the characters begin to establish their names and the audience learns their varying social status.  The intertwining stories among the guests begin to surface and the audience begins to realize there is much more in this house than what meets the eye.During the night one member of the elite group is killed.  None of the guests seemed to be fazed by this event and are only upset by the inconvenience it sets up for their lives.The only one troubled is Constance, Countess of Trentham's maid, Mary (Kelly McDonald).  The story begins to focus on Mary, who discovers secrets among the visitors and leads the audience to solve the mystery.The great aspect about this film is Robert Altman's abilities to bring the past to life.  He pays excellent attention to detail and is able to recreate the feelings and morals during the time period.  He emerges the audience into a film world filled with history and story.  Throughout the film Altman visually shows the audience the contrast between social classes through his various shots, lighting techniques, and camera filters.  His fluid camera movements visually portray foreshadowing and relationship among characters. These elements give the audience a complete understanding of the mood and atmosphere in the film.I recommend this movie to anybody who has the patience to sit and focus on this excellent film.  Although the beginning is appropriately slow moving and the characters names are difficult to remember, the payoff is worth the efforts.  This movie is made for active film viewers and all Robert Altman fans.

There are directors who have done nail-biting suspense, usually drenched in subtext, like the Director, Alfred Hitchcock. There are others who can do whatever they want and create beautiful, detached yet powerful films like Stanley Kubrick. Then there are ones who are brilliant with ensembles, telling stories which converge and often overlap within a main plot. One of them is the great Woody Allen. The other one is Robert Altman.GOSFORD PARK is an update of Jean Renoir's 1939 film LE REGLE DU JEU, in which wealthy relatives of an aristocrat come to a shooting party at a country home. Here, because of the obviously strained relationships between the host and his family has been less than amicable, it serves as a springboard where everyone's worst behavior and heretofore concealed feelings towards each other really come forth with an undertone of mean-spirited cruelty just brimming below the surface, while the servants act as non-entities when in their employers' presence but occasionally break into.Boasting one of the best introduction sequences ever, itself lengthy but necessary, GOSFORD PARK is a tour-de-force of narration that recalls Jane Austen's work. We first see Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald, playing innocence that becomes a keen observer), maid to Lady Constance Trentham (Dame Maggie Smith, having a splendid time in her role), and Lady Trentham's flighty demands and annoyed conversation as they make their way to Gosford Park. They cross paths with movie actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), his agent Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), and Weissman's prot√©g√©, Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe), who is the only one who doesn't introduce himself proper for reasons made clear later on, also heading towards the manor. The hellos are strained -- Lady Trentham is clearly not the friendly type --, but Mary is starstruck like the young girl she is. Once they (and the other guests) reach the house, activity is buzzing almost factory-like (factory being an important term here) as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren, taking self-control and omniscient stillness to a whole different level in a performance that has to be analyzed frame by frame), calmly gives out her orders. However, Altman, Fellowes, and Patrick Doyle bring a little extra dose to the scene the moment Robert Parks (Clive Owen) enters the picture and introduces himself to Mrs. Wilson while Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins) passes them by and turns to hear. Not soon after, the camera makes a zoom into a bottle of poison itself symbolic since immediately after that, the rest of the characters begin to show hints of their own shared poison. Isobel McCordle (Camila Rutherford), William (Michael Gambon) and Sylvia McCordle's (Kristin Scott Thomas) daughter, is carrying on with Freddie Nesbitt (James Wilby) who is tied to a marriage of convenience to Mabel (Claudie Blakely) whom he feels ashamed of. The Stockbridges are also on the outs, Lord Raymond (Charles Dance) preferring the safety of his own kind according to Louisa Stockbridge (Geraldine Sommerville) who is one of William McCordle's many women. Mary learns of the McCordle's familial relation to Ivor Novello from fellow maid Elsie (Emily Watson) who, while staunchly expresses her near-hatred for Lady Sylvia, suggests ever-so-slightly she whom she prefers working for. A later scene reveals little love between the McCordles, William McCordle's repudiation of Lady Constance (and his threat of withdrawing her pension) and even less love between the Nesbitts, and even more tension between the Merediths (Tom Hollander and Natasha Wightman) as they try to con McCordle into some odd business. Greed, lust, and secrets, permeating every pore of Gosford Park and its inhabitants.As a script (and a story written by Julian Fellowes), GOSFORD PARK is one of the most tightly and detailed ever committed to film because it forces the viewer to pay close attention to what characters are saying or suggesting to each other through their body language because everything has its own meaning; nothing is said or done to fulfill a plot requirement or for the sake of making conversation and even the most trivial hints are steps leading towards bigger and bigger denouements, primarily because the characters reveal in snippets pieces of information that tell us they know more about themselves than we do -- and this is its greatest asset. It is the equivalent of an abstract painting that upon scrutiny reveals layers and layers of what people dare not express up front and direct. This makes it, in fact, a delicious mystery and an open secret at the same time. Death and its cause-effect, an element ever present in an Altman film, never looked more elegantly funny. In this movie, with death coming as a murder (or double-murder if you will) to a widely disliked character, only Louisa Stockbridge expresses concern and even then it's somewhat insincere. Altman has great fun exposing the crime scene, but even more fun introducing Stephen Fry as the largely inept investigator because while the truth is brandished right in front of his face under the form of the aforementioned blink and miss pieces of information we've been getting, he doesn't see it before we do.GOSFORD PARK is also a meditation about an era where people who represent the exploited part of British society -- Robert Parks, Mrs. Wilson, Elsie --, and outsiders such as Mabel Nesbitt or Morris Weissman react against this caste system that seemed unmindful of the changes happening in the outside world. This doesn't necessarily solve anything or everything that occurs in GOSFORD PARK -- some plots are hinted at and that is fine -- but it does present an intricate comedy of manners of a time gone by just before WWII when Upstairs people mingled and shared their lives with the Downstairs people.Edited 11.17.2006 "},{"Title":"AWESOME ALTMAN!!!","Date":"21 November 2001","Score":"70 out of 103 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  This film opened the London Film festival and I was lucky enough to see get tickets. Robert Altman was there and so were most of the cast.I've seen over half of the Altman cannon of work and this has to rank up with his best. Set in the 1920's, a group of people get together for a shooting weekend at the estate of Lord and Lady Mcardle. There are two sets of characters, the Toffs upstairs and the servants downstairs.  With his customary multi-streaming overlapping narrative, cross cutting dialogue and interwoven storylines, Altman sets up dynamics within and between the two classes. There are up to 32 speaking parts and each of them is invested with a clear identity. Just from a few lines, a gesture, raising of an eyebrow, we have an idea of a character's feelings and motivations.At times the narrative moves at such a fast pace, but we never lose track of whats going on. Scenes such as the Toffs in the Drawing room having tea - many conversations happening, dynamics being set up - and another where the servants are rushing around downstairs, as the camera weeves its way through the corridors, are exhilirating cinema!!  Altman has a tight grip on the proceedings and this only wavers slightly towards the end.There is a fantastic scene, where Ivor Novello - a guest, is invited to sing for the other guests and all the servants listen covertly from whatever vanatge point they can find. Novello oustays his welcome, amongst the gentry, but the servants cant get enough.What Altman has done here, helped enormously by the wonderfully humourous script by Julian Fellows, is invested these period characters with a modern sensibility. These are not the boring, stuffed dummy museum pieces of your typical period picture, these people are real. Rich or poor, their fallibilities, desires, disaffections and frustrations are evidently clear. This movie is so good, I wanted to get up and cheer at certain points. Altman is well served by the 'creme de la creme' of British Actors. All are excellent; Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Kristin Scott-Thomas and Jeremy Northam to name a few. This film may not be everyones cup of tea and i am someone who can go watch anything from Scream 3 to the latest hot film from Asia, but those that invest the time on this film, will be much rewarded.  Altman deserves the Oscar that has eluded him for far too long.

As the relationships and tensions twist and weave upstairs, so too do the dynamics and relationships between the various house staff and valets below the stairs. Stories and characters play out but whenever a murder takes place, the police move in and everyone is a suspect.My plot summary suggests that this is a sort of murder mystery and that this will act as the driving force behind the narrative, however this is not the case and in reality the film is much more about the characters and relationships than it is about the murder. To this end the film will annoy some people who are perhaps not used to the sort of film that Altman produces and will be looking for the mystery aspect to be the all. However, I found the rather free-wheeling ensemble approach to be very enjoyable and the first hour moved quickly by thanks to the natural interactions and relationships and it was actually the mystery aspect that didn't work as well because it required too sudden a change in pace &#150; a change that the material seemed to resist and hamper. Despite this it does still work mainly because the Oscar winning writing brings out such convincing relationships and social politics, making it enjoyable and interesting throughout. The direction is great; the use of two cameras in group scenes means that the actors seem to flow around as naturally as their dialogue would suggest &#150; few seem forced to act to a fixed point and seem more realistic.Considering the talent on board, it is not surprising that nobody really upstages anyone in particular and the ensemble feel is strong. Smith, Gambon, Thomas, Dance, Northam, Balaban and others make the upstairs fizzle with snobbery and unspoken resentments. Meanwhile the downstairs staff are just as well drawn and delivered by Mirren, Owen, Jacobi, Watson, Bates, Grant, Atkins and others. Stephen Fry is fairly minor within the plot but he is delightfully comic, even if he doesn't quite fit into the film that well.Overall this is a classy film very much in the Altman style &#150; an ensemble piece of characters and relationships that we are left to drift within. Some viewers will find it frustrating that it takes so long to get to the point where the mystery kicks in but I actually found this to be the weaker aspect of the film and the most enjoyable parts were the well written characters and dialogue, which deservedly won Fellowes his Oscar.

It's a film that works on many layers and needs to be seen more than once for one to fully appreciate its resonance.The film admittedly stinks as a murder mystery---it's almost funny how little Altman himself seems interested in the who-dunnit.  But, typically for Altman, it's the deconstruction of the genre that he's interested in, not the genre itself.  This movie isn't about a murder in a country house; it's a movie about class differences and people connecting (or not connecting) with one another.It seems futile to mention stand out performances in a film filled to the rafters with stand-out performances, but I did especially like Emily Watson as a cheeky maid, Helen Mirren as the perfect servant, and Kelly MacDonald as the novice lady's attendant who grows more than anyone else over the course of the film.The film is at its best when it's probing the emotional depths of the story---it comes across as a bit too glib when the satire gets especially acidic (mostly with the Kristin Scott Thomas character), but like the best of his movies (Nashville, M*A*S*H, Short Cuts) Altman knows how to control his own cynicism and doesn't let sarcasm rule.With his on again-off again track record, we can expect the next Altman film to tank, so let's enjoy this one while we can.

People think that this film sucks because they don't like multi-story plot and they find it difficult to follow the stories. Some may expect a spine-chilling murder and want to be scared and wet the seat. However, those who really appreciate and understand the movie know more than clear that the film itself focuses on the life of the upper-class people (and the life of the time) rather than a bloody crime. The movie defines the word originality no better. In fact, Julian Fellowes deserves all the awards he received since the screenplay is challenging to write and it's difficult to pack all the stories in a 150-minute movie. He explains the complicated relationship between the visitors so well, and he virtually creates a motive for murdering Sir William for everyone so that the crime itself becomes very mystifying. Of course, I must admit that there are really too many characters and it's simply impossible to keep track of everyone's movement in the first half of the movie; but Julian leaves the necessary hints for our understanding that our feeling intensifies more and more as the story unfolds. Even better is the dialogue - sharp, sarcastic, amusing, clever. It confers life to the film and fully delineates the character of the many visitors however short the time is when they appear on the screen. Before I saw it, I had always asked why Memento did not win an Oscar. But the time when the film ended, I was left stunned on my seat. I mean both stories are great and original, but when comparing the relative difficulty in writing the screenplay, Gosford Park apparently wins.Gosford Park is to me perhaps the second best movie I've seen this year (after A Beautiful Mind). If you like films like Magnolia and Traffic, which require much patience to enjoy, it's perhaps the greatest movie of your lifetime.

Naturally, I was looking forward for some good social satire in the shape of the always reliable clash of the classes theme. Robert Altman had the right pedigree as a director, and I actually liked some of his previous works such as The Player and Dr. T and the Women, so there was some cause for interest there. Also, this was promoted as a story of a classic old Hollywood murder mystery, another motivation to go see it. Boy was I wrong. I can't even start to explain how many things went wrong for me upon watching this train-wreck of a film. For starters, the film was way too talky - not that its bad, but in this case, the endless discussions never actually reached a point. Also, it was very hard to relate to the belated ensemble cast, given the fact they were mostly made up of actors portraying pretentious and extremely dull English snobs, who lead a decadent and obsolete way of life. The movie didn't make me care for any of the characters, want to learn more about them and what motivates them, or give any further attention to their boring tea parties, hunting trips or twisted relations with their butlers and maids.At one point of the film I just began looking at my wrist watch, trying as hard as I can not to fall asleep, waiting for the promised murder mystery to occur so there would be some sort of force of interest to push the plot forward. After all, there is a certain degree of patience one can bare when staring helplessly at yawn-inducing characters talking about ever so boring issues. I felt as though the film was just going on and on with no real plot or point to look forward to at the end of the tunnel. When the foul felony finally took place, I was apathetic towards whatever was happening, that I couldn't care less. It was THAT bad.Thankfully, I gave Altman another chance and really enjoyed A Prairie Home Companion, his final work before passing away. However, that still doesn't erase the fact that Gosford Park is one of the slowest, pointless, dullest, unsatisfying experiences I've had at the cinema. I'm usually into dramas, and I have an incredibly low bar of entertainment &#150; even the most overused clich√©s in films tend to amuse me the slightest bit.

I wonder why so many people miss this.Balaban is from an old film family and is among the more intellectual men in the business. Altman spends an inordinate amount of time thinking about the art and how he differs from others. And he does. Now you don't have to imagine what they talk about.The conventional approach to high quality visual directing is for it all to emanate as a vision in the author and/or director's mind. The actors are expected to recreate that vision. So when a particularly strong image results, it is because the actor filled in the space in front of the camera. Think of this as actors in service to the director, the employer.Altman is different in a fundamental way. He comes up with a vague sketch of a script descriptions of characters and a situation. He allows the actors to find their own way. The result is often -- as here -- remarkably dense, taught, real. So much finer than can be filtered through several minds. Think of this as the director is service to the actors.Here's where the upstairs/downstairs metaphor comes in.Now think how Altman works with his camera. He has astonishing movement. His legendary reputation as a filmmaker rests primarily on his skill in adding to the effect of the scene by making our eye an active part of what is going on by placing lights and moving the camera. Hitchcock invented this notion, but then he is in that large group of directors who simply boss the actors about. Easy to place the camera right when you know where everything is going to be. But what if you don't? Then you have to be the perfect servant, understanding your masters so thoroughly that you can anticipate what they are going to do.There you have the idea that Balaban and Altman first sketched. Now to make it highly self-referential, what do you do? You set a conventional murder mystery and actually place the filmmaker in the middle of the action, continuously commenting on how this is to be shaped. But he's completely ignorant, hence the references to formulaic Charlie Chan. The real solution would only be known by someone who understands this notion of anticipative service. Enhance the metaphor with notions of `children' from the upstairs through the wombs of the downstairs.More make it obvious that we are talking about the moving camera eye, so actually insert Ivor Novello in the action as `entertainment.' Ivor was in `The Lodger,' Hitchcock's first film where he used this `moving eye' style. His attunement to Ivor's movements (it is a silent film) was what was so remarkable at the time. Notice that Balaban doesn't `shoot.'Altman is not a man of half measures, so make it even more self-referential make one (only one) of the privileged guests disguise himself as a servant, to cross the line. You can't play on both teams.This is not a film about manners, not a costume drama, not a whodunit. The story is about what it is a film about the fluid, anticipative eye, in service to some of the most talented theatrical actors alive. The enjoyment in this film is not in watching the actors, pleasant though that is; it is in watching how we watch the actors and marveling at how our eye becomes part of the `team.'Every actor here, every footman and scullery maid is a better actor than Julia Roberts, who incidentally shot Balaban in the throat in Mexico. Every actor except Ryan Phillippe. He's the white space, the reference point of bland American fare, intended to show us what bad acting is all about. Notice how staid the camera is when following him.It is all heavy symbolism and would be the first thing commented on in a P T Andersen film. But not here. Now that's art.

Class distinction is demonstrated funnily between the people who live above the stairs and those who live below. It is especially the interaction between the characters, who clearly dislike one another but are forced by circumstance (due to various obligations) to practice social rituals, that provides some of the most amusing cinematic moments. It is all done with clever subtlety.Bob Balaban and Robert Altmann story idea combined with Fellowes's eloquent writing is first rate. The dialogues are filled with wit, humour and subtle depth. The mansion itself plays a key character in the story but it is the spellbinding cinematography that functions as the mansion's eyes.

The film also slowly demonstrates the disintegration of the English class system (that started around the war).Altman has assembled a mountain of talented actors that include a bitchy Maggie Smith, a pompous Michael Gambon, an obnoxious Kristin Scott Thomas, a vulnerable Camilla Rutherford, a desperate Tom Hollander, a devil-may-care Geraldine Somerville, a knows-where-he-stands Jeremy Northam, a douchebag Bob Balaban, a horny Ryan Phillipe, a stupid Stephen Fry, a loyal Sophie Thompson, a principled Helen Mirren, an enigmatic Clive Owen, a no-nonsense Emily Watson, a not-to-be-messed-with Richard E. Grant, a pulling-it-together Derek Jacobi, a frightened Alan Bates, a grumpy Eileen Atkins and an adorable Kelly Macdonald. 'Gosford Park' has one of the best ensemble cast.I also loved the soundtrack. It is never overdone. The jazzy tracks contribute well in setting the atmosphere and there are some wonderful songs performed by Jeremy Northam's character.In the beginning, it is a little difficult to keep up with the names of the characters which leads to a bit of confusion but with a little bit of patience, once you're over that, it becomes easy to follow. Like a beautiful painting, once it captivates the viewers attention it immediately involves them in an alternate world. From the start, you feel like an ignored guest and at the end it's as though the host has just seen you out.

In reality, it is damning indictment of the class system and the level of servitude expected from those at the top of the tree from those that wait upon them.What was surprising was the level of humour that Altman brings to what is, as it unfolds, a very sad story of transgression and loss.  Maggie Smith has all the funniest lines as a viscious but impoverished woman who comes to her family with begging cap in hand.  Those playing characters above stairs all look and sound the part and effortlessly give the impression of wealth and privelege and the callousness that breeds.Many of the downstairs characters drive the story and there are some wonderfully wry performances from the likes of Richard E Grant and  Alan Bates.  As the moral centre of the film, Kelly McDonald is excellent and is well matched by Emily Watson as Emily and Clive Owen as Parkes.  Ruling the downstairs troop is Helen Mirren whose cool visage hides a seething mass of emotion.  A well deserved nomination here.Only Robert Altman could assemble a cast of this magnitude and distinction and have many of them speak no more than a few lines !  Greats of English theatre like Derek Jacobi have small but memorable roles and there is not a bad note struck from any of the predominantly English cast.I was slightly puzzled by the character played by Ryan Phillipe (although his perforamce was fine) but felt that the intrusion of two Americans into this  English mix worked well to highlight the entrenched class roles played by everyone in the house.Whilst perhaps not his best work, this is a very good Altman film - we move in and out of conversations whilst never losing their import and the cimematography has a fluidity that few other film makers can match.A classy piece of film-making that rewards careful attention from the viewer.

I did somewhat enjoy Nashville, BUT, his particular style does not leave sufficient time or space on film to develop the characters in any depth, nor do we see any real growth.I had a similar reaction to this film, but found Gosford Park even less satisfying, thanks to the very high hopes I had based on the writing of Julian Fellowes, which has been so magnificent in Downton Abbey, and on the sheer number of extremely talented actors/actresses in the cast. Sadly, all of this talent is wasted in this film. Mr. Altman seems not to have sufficient regard for his audience to feel that it is necessary to actually tell a story.The result for me is a film which doesn't know what it wants to accomplish - will this be a rich, rewarding drama of lives affording us the opportunity to care about intriguing characters, or will this be a brain-teasing British mystery? Sadly, as a mystery it is an epic failure, since the murder in the story and its solution seem not to interest the filmmaker at all and none of it is really resolved. As a British drama, it also fails miserably, in that we don't really get much of the interactions of the characters to learn enough about them to be interested or to care what they do.In fact, I will be forced to muddle through this film a second time (should I even waste my time?) merely to see which character goes with which name. There is no excuse for this sort of sloppiness, regardless of whether that is Robert Altman's personal style or not. Perhaps he just is an incompetent director? I would love to see this film remade with the same cast including an extra 30 minutes of screenplay written by good old J. Fellowes. As it now stands, it doesn't quite add up to a whole story.

Boring, insignificant soapish details, boring characters with very sporadic interjections of almost-funny humor that does nothing.  Folks, I'm not a sadist or anything so don't take this the wrong way, but EVEN THE MURDER WAS BORING.  As for plot, absolutely nothing happened in this film, even with a dead body present.  The ending fell more flat than a week old soda, and throughout the film not so much as a spark toward any climax of any kind happened.

It was sold as a detective film, which it most assuredly is not. The theme is a favorite of Altman's that he returns to with regularity disillusionment. Before you consider watching this penetrating look into the upstairs / downstairs worlds of a landed 'noble,' whose conduct contradicts his title, be warned, it is an existential character study of nobility upstairs and the servant world below them. William has converted his opulent palace into a brothel of sorts, preying upon the servant women then dumping the babies, unceremoniously, in the closest orphanage. Unbeknownst to William, one of his rejected children has returned for vengeance. Secreted amongst the army of attendants waiting on these 'nobles', is the rejected boy who has come to kill William. Trust me, by the end of the movie you won't have a tad of sympathy for him. The only one he shows kindness to is his dog, the humans, all waiting in line for begging from him, he treats with open scorn and contempt. Maggie Smith's Constance steals the movie as the world's richest beggar. Completely helpless, from the opening, her Rolls must be pulled over because she cannot figure out how to get the lid off of a Thermos. Looking down her nose upon everyone, she delights in torturing Northam who plays a famous actor. She cannot tolerate his singing and playing, which are quite good actually, flinging venom all about her. She loves the knife,Say, what do you do when one of your pictures flops like that? If you asked me what Altman's theme is it is contained in the words of Northam's sad ballad,We shall never find that lovely land of might have been. The male servants are not spared bed duties either. Watch for Sylvia putting the arm on Weisman's valet, really his homosexual lover infiltrating the servants for movie research, she instructs him when to return to service her. William revels in torturing his relatives; he boasts to Sylvia how he is going to wait until much later to tell the desperate businessman he is pulling out of his venture. Altman uses some great symbolism here, at the garden party, where William joyfully tells the man he is ruined. Watch for the Bloody Mary cup, which looks like his blood, knocked onto the cement floor. William has got his latest victim, played by Emily Watson, completely deluded that he cares for her. To Altman's credit, the servants are not delineated with the slightest idealization. The two head ladies do not speak to each other except for house business. Again, there is a murder which Altman uses more to show you the Law's differential treatment of the landed rich. The bumbling detective couldn't find his desk in his office. What you see here is just like Kansas City, where the Harlow worshiping woman gets her husband returned to her gutted like a fish by the local gangster. The pair were so sure that he could rob an African American and there was nothing, in the 30's, that he would dare do to them. You see this motif in most of his films MASH, 3 Women disillusionment. Constance will have you throwing things at the screen for she revels in working her servant to death while constantly subjecting everyone to scathing abuse. Even the breakfast fails the standards of the worst richest beggar. Altman is at pains to show their helplessness after decades of being waited upon. They all observe the clock, when Weisman asks for breakfast, it throws them into deep confusion. The best way to review this movie is to ask you if you like deep, misanthropic looks into human groups nobles and servants? The movie took plenty of spleen, as you see here, because people expecting Murder On The Orient Express, were none too pleased to be in the middle of Altman's dissection of humans, their cruelty and, also, their secrets. Altman always rivaled Kubrick for his deep misanthropy which is always present. A movie that opens with,Suicide is painless, it brings on many changes and I can give or take it as I please. Northam's song is quite evocate of that MASH anthem. The verses contain the movie's central message the cruelty of human society and what a contrast it is to their delusions about its putative warmth. This features his usual excellent acting with a truly one of a kind cast. Yes, my friends, upon this earth we shall never find that lovely land of might have been. An Excellent Movie.

It might well be a well-produced drama of the sort the UK excels at but personally, I find such costumed outings rather dour, plodding affairs. However, this movie - with its Agatha Christie-style country house and a cast-list for the ages - offers something a little different. It still feels a little slow but it offers an authentic look at class, privilege and gender politics. It's also brilliantly written, directed and performed and is probably Roger Altman's best film after MASH.In 1932, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his trophy wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott Thomas) invite a number of guests over for a shooting weekend. Among their guests are matin√©e idol Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) and his Hollywood producer friend Morris Weissman (co-producer Bob Balaban) as well as the Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her maid-servant Mary (Kelly MacDonald). As the weekend goes on, Sir William has to fend off constant attempts to secure his fortune from his guests while the gossiping house-staff, led by his butler Jennings (Alan Bates) and housekeeper Mrs Wilson (Helen Mirren), ensure that the weekend goes as smoothly as possible. Before long, a murder is committed but who is the guilty party? Is it head house-maid Elsie (Emily Watson) who has something to hide? Could it be enigmatic valet Mr Denton (Ryan Phillippe) or charismatic loner Parks (Clive Owen), the valet of Lord Stockbridge (Charles Dance)? Hopefully, Inspector Thomson (Stephen Fry) and his constable companion Dexter (Ron Webster) can crack the case before all the guests have to return home...Like most murder mysteries, Gosford Park spends a lot of time filling the screen with details both relevant and irrelevant. In fact, the murder is arguably the most surprisingly thing about the film as so much time is spent with both upstairs with the party-goers and downstairs with the staff that it almost feels like a documentary at times. To prevent boredom from completely taking over, the film injects a good deal of humour into proceedings - Smith's cantankerous countess is witty and loaded with barbed asides while Fry's detective is as gloriously aloof as those he interviews, maintaining an almost Clouseau-like ignorance of the facts presented to him. But all the cast are superb - I've never seen this many British stars at once outside of a Harry Potter film - but this is a true ensemble piece as dialogue blends together to further enhance the authentic feel of the film. The script, penned by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, leaves just enough to keep you guessing but because it spends so long setting the crime up, you sort of feel as though he's more concerned about writing a period piece as opposed to a mystery.Although it won't be to everyone's taste, Gosford Park feels like a big-screen outing for Mrs Marple but without the silver-haired sleuth in attendance. Yes, it's brilliantly made and at times very funny but I wanted a bit more pace to proceedings. I honestly felt that once every red herring imaginable had been planted in the first hour-and-a-bit, Fellowes simply worked out yet another possibility and wrote that as the ending. And to be frank, the climax felt a little rushed and the least believable bit of the picture as nobody actually seems that bothered that they've spent the weekend with a murderer in their midst. Still, credit must go towards the look of the film which is spot-on and the actors who are all magnificent. In truth, the film is less a murder-mystery and more a realistic portrayal of life in a country house in the early 1930's. Fellowes almost feels nostalgic for such a time when ladies knew their place, their men could be utter cads without them batting an eyelid and both were wholly reliant on their staff, who held them in mock-respect as though their livelihoods depended on it - which they did, of course. It is as British as Earl Grey tea, cucumber sandwiches and strawberries and cream at Wimbledon - something which appeals more to foreign markets more than the UK where I'm from. After all, if the TV series Midsomer Murders can be a global hit...

But what in those films was inspired chaos is, in Gosford Park, just chaos. And all the King's horses and all the King's men (to say nothing of the knights, ladies and other A-list British actors who mostly comprise the sterling cast) couldn't put Gosford together again.The idea of creating one movie from several familiar English story lines no doubt seemed tasty to Altman and his collaborators Bob Balaban and Julian Fellowes. They set out to present a scathing examination of the upper class in that time-honored setting&#151;a shooting party&#151;using an Upstairs/Downstairs-style format, and encase it all in an Agatha Christie-esquire drawing room murder plot, with a John Cleese-y bumbling inspector thrown in for good measure. If this sounds like too much, it is. The movie is pulled in so many directions, it never gets anywhere. While some of the class satire is wickedly well done, the murder story is given perfunctory treatment. The subplots explaining why several none-too-suspicious suspects want the victim dead are so forgettable, and carelessly presented, you get the idea that Altman himself doesn't really care. The revelation of the real killer seems more an afterthought than a climax. And Stephen Fry's incongruous, idiotic investigator seems mistakenly edited in from another movie.Trying to tell too many stories at once isn't the only problem afflicting Gosford Park. It also suffers from too many characters. While the many roles in Nashville were as deftly and distinctly drawn as Hirschfeld caricatures, Gosford is confusing in its superfluity of indistinguishable minor parts.The frustrations noted are lightened by the many fine performances. Clive Owen, Eileen Atkins, Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren earn top honors, with honorable mentions to Kristen Scott Thomas, Jeremy Northram, Michael Gambon, Ryan Phillippe, Emily Watkins and Richard E.

Alan Bates and Derek Jacobi are also on hand to ensure that Gosford Park offers the most spectacular cast assembled since Murder on the Orient Express.All in all, not unenjoyable, but a very mixed bag.

Thrown into the mix is an American (Ryan Phillippe) who serves as director Robert Altman's chance to show how indiscriminate and non-snobbish Americans are by having him sleep with every available person in the household, whether servant or society, male or female.Handsome atmosphere, elegant settings, a bit of intrigue and an unpleasant main character (destined to be murdered by someone in true mystery fashion) are not compensation enough for a story that leaves us unsatisfied with its conclusion. There are superb performances by Maggie Smith, Ryan Phillippe, Kristin Scott Thomas, Helen Mirren, Derek Jacoby and others in roles not fully fleshed out thanks to a relentlessly murky screenplay. The cynicism of Robert Altman is apparent in every frame.Slow paced and ultimately unsatisfying both as entertainment and for those who think they are going to see a good old-fashioned mystery. The dialogue is a crisp putdown by both the snobbish uppercrusters and the servants of every conceivable person within the household, leaving one with a nasty feeling that back in 1932 the British class system was even more poisonous than it is nowadays.

(We are spared one of the usual easy target pickings, the Fascist sympathies of the aristocracy, by fixing the shooting party weekend as taking place very specifically in 1932.)The ensemble character acting and camera movement are simply masterful -- with Altman's mandate that we only see scenes that the downstairs folk pass through or are in, equating them with the spying camera, and us, too, of course. If these names weren't already a Who's Who of British (and two American) actors, each of their key scenes would be one of those star making break-outs. In an interview Altman noted that he intentionally made most of the biggest stars downstairs, though our guide through the very confusing relationships upstairs and downstairs is a newcomer, Mary Macdonald (interestingly the first actress cast for the film), representing the audience. Roger Ebert pointed out how key the performance is of another relative newcomer, Claudie Blakley as a put-upon parvenu, in putting the relationships into relief, particular the changes the weekend has wrought on the participants. While Maggie Smith seems to stand out because her character is noisier, a fellow actress protested in an interview that Smith did not in fact get the best lines -- she just did more with them -- like what she does to the phrase day-old marmalade. Spotlighting particular performances could be endless -- though of course I got a kick out of two of my favorites, Clive Owen, who fairly radiates sexuality here, and Ryan Phillippe, playing for both teams, plus Richard Grant's smirks are priceless. Helen Mirren is startlingly different than so many of her other roles.The class differences even amusingly extend to the investigating policemen. The inclusion of Bob Balaban as a Hollywood producer (and co-producer of this movie) also opens up the film to Hollywood and American jokes. The movie is really laugh out loud funny, and the full house I saw it with really got into it, particularly the visual jokes and overheard lines. It quickly spins serious as the camera restlessly glides throughout the house -- the actors had to stay in character throughout all the scenes, adding chitchat to the script, as they had no idea where the camera would be. Until the credits, I had no idea that Ivor Novello was a real songwriter, sung and played here charmingly by Jeremy Northam, and the characters' various reactions to his typical pop music of the day are a key element to the film.Three cheers to a 76-year-old director!

Maggie Smith is, as always, great--but hasn't she played the mean old rich woman once too often?  Clive Owen is--interesting.  He's certainly good-looking but seems somewhat stiff in his role (although that's how it should be played).  The worst acting is easily from Phillippe--get some acting lessons bud!Also, blessedly, there's no gratuitous female nudity in this film--Altman seems to usually have a thing for having his actresses strip for no good reason--he held back this time.  Why this film has an R rating I can't say.  No nudity, no sex, the murder is bloodless and there's no swearing.  So why the R?All in all, not top-notch Altman but still pretty good.

He lifts their spirits, they forget themselves, and for a moment all work ceases. The irony here is that because they're so entranced they fail to grasp the song's meaning, which is about hopeless longing and dreams unfulfilled. It puts smiles on their faces anyway, but has no effect at all on the upstairs guests, who spend so much energy posturing that they can't seem to recognize the value of any of the many graces offered to them. The downstairs staff certainly appreciates the entertainment, since they toil day and night over details like the distance between the knife and the fork, and whether strawberry marmalade will suffice when the raspberry jam runs out. 'The perfect servant has no life,' declares Mrs. Wilson, and while her pride is admirable, her sacrifice is tragic. What a shame, giving all of your time away to dote on people who don't themselves seem to know how to live, either.The super wealthy can't be entirely blamed for their plight, which I think stems from loneliness. People tend to behave oddly around the rich and famous&#x97;they get nervous, begin putting on an act, or trying so hard not to that they clam up. Like a highway patrol cop in traffic, the presence of esteem inspires everyone close by to alter their behavior. It makes sense then that the rich prefer to surround themselves with hired help who are paid to behave respectfully rather than go out into the world and live their lives in public. Their wealth affords them the illusion of a public life in a private and controlled setting. The danger is that after spending years dealing primarily with one's own servants, one might become incapable of dealing with anyone else&#x85; even, say, an inspector who needs help solving a murder.Consider the inspector's interactions with the guests. They treat him like the pizza delivery guy. They talk at him flippantly, begrudge him a moment for questioning, and fail to summon a shred of helpful information. This apparent insubordination is more out of apathy than defiance, and the inspector isn't blameless either. He treats witnesses with kid gloves, allows himself to be interrupted but never himself interrupts. I imagine that he would have more vigorously interrogated potential witnesses had the murder occurred in a poor or middle class district, but he behaves submissively when dealing with the guests at Gosford Park.Attending a shooting party like this one is an exercise in straddling that line between intent and image. Image obscures intent, so it must be hard, being a wealthy host, to trust whether guests are attending out of true friendship. We, the audience, can certainly be sure that they are not because of the film's fly on the wall point of view. We quickly become aware of their disparate natures, that they only harmonize in their collective effort to remain in the good graces of Sir William. To open up to each other is to risk exposure or embarrassment, so distance is crucial to maintain a safe proximity. These aren't friends; these are satellites in tow. I makes sense, then, that when Sir William is killed and an inspector starts asking questions, no investigative headway is made. This is because as far as the guests are concerned, with Sir William gone there is no longer any need to engage. It's time to float away, like debris in outer space.The idea of behavior obscuring motive is relatively foreign to Americans. I recently hosted an English traveler who needed a couch to crash on, and he told me that in English culture, protocol of behavior is of the utmost importance. We can enslave entire cultures, but we'll do it with a stiff upper lip, while we have our afternoon tea, he said. I believe Americans tend to flaunt our motives more overtly, embody them. It's seen as a sign of virtue when a salesman embodies salesmanship, an athlete competition, a computer whiz nerd-dom. I feel (and this is pure conjecture) that to embody 'good manners' is valued but not to the degree that it is in Europe, particularly England. In America, we are almost suspicious of those whose intentions aren't clear. Consider the way characters in reality shows interact. Their behavior is motivated by primordial urges&#x97;chiefly, the urge to impose their personality. The line 'I'm not here to make friends' seems to be a reoccurring catchphrase. Gosford Park operates by almost opposing values America's brand of 'reality' is best concealed so that the surface always appears squeaky clean. I would guess that even a non-English speaker, having spent a weekend with the casts of any of the new 'real world' shows, would walk away with a pretty good understanding of who those people are simply because the personalities are so unabashed. Yet I feel as though a fellow English speaker, even a thoughtful and aware individual, could spend a weekend at Gosford Park and walk away thinking only of how charming the affair was, but having no clue as to what was really going on.Despite all of this I can't agree with the film's outlook, an outlook I would call altogether cynical. The alternative to the lifestyle of affluence is a lifestyle of needs-based living. For years I lived minimally, considering excess a burden and ambition a form of avarice, and you know maybe I wasn't wrong. But if we must rise with each new day, I don't see the harm in striving for some form of highness, even if illusory, as long as an attempt is made towards balance. This film is about the imbalance, the extremity of Postbellum English aristocracy. It emphasizes the evils and the folly that wealth and servitude cause without acknowledging that wealth is simply the end result of something inherently good. It doesn't express the reality that if we didn't posture whatsoever, we would be left crawling.

Hold on a minute, there was a library in Cluedo, wasn't there? There's no library in the Gosford Park house. At least, I didn't see one... Whatever, the point being that there is a murder at the core of this lavish, period piece from 2001 and a handful of people of varying genders; backgrounds; nationalities and classes all caught up in this stately locale facing down the barrel of a charge. Alas, I wanted to like the film more than I did; eventually finding myself to be worn down by the film's run time and its excessive amount of characters depicted therein, where in the past I have often taken to Altman projects feeding off such things. And yet it doesn't have any right to often be as engaging as it sometimes is - unlike a game of Cluedo, the death at the heart of Gosford Park is inconsequential; it is ultimately about the people and the talking, the dialogue driven scenes depicting a bygone British class system nattering away about not much in particular but doing well to side us with the perspective of a young female maid engaging with her infirm, snobbish elderly boss. I wanted a film about them. In a sense, we get one; in another sense, it isn't anything to do with them. The imbalance is cause for frustration.Dignitaries of all sorts and of differing ilks are gathering at a huge country estate in 1930's England; they're there for a weekend of hunting and whatnot at the behest of their host, Michael Gambon. Like most of Gambon's characters, the host is brash and loud and swans around the place coming across as being in control without necessarily having to do much. He likes to shoot birds for sport; enjoys the presence of the young female maids at his home (especially when they're wearing what they wear) and isn't generally much in the way of a bang-up guy. The ship that is the manor house is run so tightly under his watch, that should certain maids be caught on the incorrect storey, severe ramifications would unfold.All is not well away from the host and his friends either. Within certain couples staying at the lodge for the duration, arguments are arising and there is a general sense of both distrust and unease amongst everyone as this disparate congealed unit consisting of this body of personnel gear up for exquisite dinners; rich company and the pleasures that apparently come with being able to go out on a hunt and shoot stuff the sort of things that need to run smoothly so as to even have a hope of working. A good deal of it does consist of people both sitting and standing around; talking, eating, arguing and switching between their public personas and private personas faces and attitudes their friends know them for, as well as such things for which their closer peers know them. When the time comes for Gambon's character to die at the bereft of one of those present, there is room for most to be a suspect; in spite of Altman's guile to cut to a specific few people looking shifty and suspicious as they re-enter the lounge wherein everybody congregated away from the crime scene.For most, the idea of a film wherein a lone murder doesn't have to, or need to, constitute as the focal point around which the entire film must hinge will sound like a masterstroke of film-making; pacing, et al. I found it engaging without being riveting, a matter of style over substance for a great deal of its time. The film is more a snapshot of what a smattering of folks, typical to 1930's Great Britain, at a manor retreat for a weekend of hunting and fine dining might resemble. The rummaging around for a narrative; an event anything gives way to something as jarring as a death that's not even the focal point of the piece in the first place. We don't mind this, of course, but apart from Kelly Macdonald's scenes with her elderly employer, played by Maggie Smith, we are scrapping around for scant consolation in terms of plot and character, with these specific sequences becoming beacons upon which we grasp for any kind of interest. Macdonald is better than what her job says she is someone curious where curiosity in a young woman is frowned upon; someone outgoing and looking to engage, someone working for Smith's character not out of respect or because Smith can boss her around with consummate ease (although she does), but because she comes cheap. There is an amusing self-aware, sub-The Player skit nearer the beginning of the film, arriving in the form of an American character pitching an idea for a detective story which eerily begins to sync up with what's transpiring before everyone something with a similarly subversive idea to that of The Player, but not unfolding in a film quite as good. Ah yes, The Player THERE was a film.

But the movie turned out to be much more...excellent character studies, dialogue, shrewd observations of the class system and a plot that exposes the linkages between the disparate group that comes together on one weekend in November 1932. The guests and their entourage of servants give a masterly demonstration of the English class system at work with its many protocols and unwritten rules. One can see how it was the inspiration for the television series Downton Abbey with relationships and codes of conduct parallel to what turns up in the current TV saga. In their gossip and the petty details that dominate their lives, we find that underneath their respective roles, these individuals, both the servants or aristocrats, are not really very different form one another. Ironically, the servants are as much the creatures of habit upholding the system, as are the rich and titled who are often not very rich and struggling to hold on to their status. There were enough tongue-in-cheek lines to keep me entertained from start to finish.The movie also shows the world and attitudes of the old order British aristocracy clashing with the new money class from the American film world. There are few references to the world outside that was being torn asunder in the 1930's by depression and impending war. This is the one flaw I found in an otherwise splendid production. The story hinges on the working class victims of the master of the estate, who systematically covered his misdeeds at their expense. There is a murder mystery but it occurs well into the movie. It further highlights the insecurities and vanities of almost everyone in the household.Maggie Smith was brilliant in her role, delivering her lines in a way that mocked the very character she played. The acting of Kelly MacDonald (Boardwalk Empire/HBO), as the personal assistant to Maggie Smith's Lady Trentham, was impressive. We are also treated to the acting of Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott-Thomas, Eileen Atkins, Allan Bates, Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, Clive Owen, Charles Dance, Jeremy Northam, Derek Jacobi, and others. All in all, a great movie but with the emphasis on dialogue and acting, it may not be to the liking of all movie-goers. I have seen it on three occasions and would happily watch it again.

So I expected some likes of `Murder on the Orient Express'. The murder scene shown in the film was a huge giveaway, so at that time I KNEW there would be some likes of `Orient Express'. One suspect was VERY OBVIOUS.By the time of the murder I guessed almost all personal histories and connections explained in the very end, all the important ones anyhow. There are PLENTY of very obvious hints if you can manage to hear or read every word. There are many clues altogether, but somehow the ones that turn out true are much stronger and more believable from the beginning, so the wrong ones don't hinder your guesswork. So as far as mystery is concerned, there is not much of it the film.How about the social life of British aristocracy and their servants? Don't know about you, but in my school I was taught from grade four (the first year we had history) that aristocracy, or any ruling class before the dictatorship of the proletariat, was stupid, idle, self-absorbed, while the lower classes were honest, loyal, patriotic, hard-working and selfless. So that message didn't sound very original or believable for me either. As a formerly brainwashed person, I don't appreciate anything that resembles the ideas that were once stuffed into my head. Until the very end of the film I expected a miracle &#150; a plot twist. It didn't happen. And here is the real twist despite of all said above I really enjoyed watching the film.

Altman at times gets carried with his characters; the first hour sped by and it was difficult to grasp all the dialogue as scenes flitted by.The film gradually settles and there are some great moments; one being Ivor Novello (Northam) playing his repertoire to a sometimes unappreciative audience whilst the servants peer hidden from doorways rapt in attention or dance together in a darkened room.Some have said that the murder mystery is incidental - who cares who murdered who etc,it's the social interaction which counts etc- but for me, it was the highlight esp. the explanation, which cleverly linked characters above & below the stairs.

'Gosford Park' is stylish and elegant, witty and sharp, well written and excellently acted out. To begin with, I was wondering whether the filmmakers would be able to tie all the different people and their stories together in a coherent way, but my fears were put solidly to rest.The film is set on a country manor in England in 1932, where a group of guests arrive for a weekend shooting party. We follow both the 'upper class' in the luxurious lounges and their servants in the quarters below, and watch how their lives and actions intertwine. There are literally dozens of people to keep track of, but somehow Robert Altman manages to convey some individual character traits in all of them to help us keep them apart from each other and keep our interest in them going. Numerous plot lines are served for the viewer to enjoy and be puzzled by as the characters eat, drink, laugh, smoke, go hunting, have sex and insult each other with impeccable perfection. Conflicts, jealousy, secret relationships and sexual encounters take place, not only among the nobility, but also between the nobility and their servants. Then, suddenly, a murder takes place. A fumbling police inspector arrives to investigate, but it is one of the servants, a young chambermaid named Mary, who on her own manages to solve the puzzle and discover who the murderer is.The murder mystery is not the centre of attention of this movie, however. It rather focuses on the relationships between people of different classes, and is a brilliant insight in a 'lost era' &#150; the lavish lifestyle of the British upper class in the period between the two world wars. Rarely has the class differences in British society been better portrayed than in this film. Quick glances and subtle (and sometimes even not so subtle) remarks are enough to put someone thoroughly in their place. One of the less fortunate upper class wives appears in the same dress two nights in a row. 'It's so nice to be able to travel light, isn't it' one of the other women sardonically comments. It is also interesting to watch the relationship between the British elite and the small American contingent at the party. 'Oh, don't mind him &#150; he's an American', one of the main characters informs the detective when he arrives to investigate the murder. Another excellent example is when the American film producer arrives at breakfast and expects the servants to wait on him, only to be told very coolly and matter-of-factly 'in England, nobody is served at breakfast'. It's a delicious understatement which really portrays the way (many) Englishmen (used to?) look down upon Americans.The upper class gossip among themselves; as do the servants below. But interestingly enough, their stories are exchanged in the many private chambers of the manor. Mary's employer, the formidable Countess of Trentham &#150; brilliantly played by Maggie Smith &#150; downright expects Mary to give her 'the dirt' on the other guests which she has heard from their servants. Discretion is a trait she doesn't value in a maid, she proudly announces &#150; unless it's discretion concerning herself, of course. And in the end, it is Mary's ability to put two and two together and uncover the hidden past of several of the weekend guests which enables her to find out who the murderer is.With a veritable 'who's who' of British elite actors (who all do their very best) involved, it's difficult to point out someone in particular. But Maggie Smith has to be mentioned, as she truly excels here. She certainly has been given the meatiest role, with dozens of razor-sharp one-liners on her repertoire (she effectively castrates Mr. Novello, the actor, who plays the piano in the lounge &#150; 'don't encourage him, or he'll go on forever'; and when the American film producer is reluctant to give away the ending of his latest film at the dinner table, she deadpans 'oh, don't worry &#150; nobody here will see it'). She literally steals every scene she's in, and is certainly worthy of her Academy nomination (she should have won, too). Other excellent performances come from Helen Mirren as the head servant, Kristin Scott-Thomas as the snobbish, world-weary lady Sylvia, Stephen Fry as the Inspector (although his incompetence is stressed a little too heavy in my opinion) and Alan Bates as Jennings the (alcoholic) butler.As a true anglophile, this film was really 'my cup of tea', as the British would say, and I rate it a perfect 6 out of 6 on my dice.

Most films and TV shows showing the British aristocracy in the old days depict a comfortable life, with deferential people to wait on you and plenty to eat and drink. Life has an agreeably slow pace and the conversation is stimulating. Upstairs/Downstairs hinted at some of the dark side of this picture, as did Remains of the Day. Now, one of the greatest directors, Robert Altman gives us his take on the form. Every character in this is in some sort of turmoil. Some are afraid of getting fired and thrown out to be on their own. Some are afraid of dark secrets being reveals. Some are afraid of being cut off and unable to maintain their lifestyle. Some are thwarted by life and very angry about it. Some are just bored to tears. But everywhere, there is chaos.Don't tell anybody, but this is not a murder mystery. It's also not a comedy. If you were looking for suspense, intrigue or laughs, you will be disappointed. What this is, as are all of Altman's films, is a group character study, a cross section of a place and time. That's the reason that so many fine actors flock to his films. they know they are going to get something to sink their teeth into. While you are looking for the famous faces, please note that Kristen Scott-Thomas's maid is played by Meg Wynn-Owen, who played James's wife, Hazel on Upstairs/Downstairs. The head cook is played by Eileen Atkins, who co-created Upstairs/Downstairs with Jean Marsh. Their original conception took a much more cynical view of service and the upper class than the eventual series that came out. They wanted to make a show about a drunken butler and an upstairs full of twits, something a little more in the spirit of what Altman was doing here, although he didn't go so far as to make his film into a comedy.Arguably, Altman's films are not comedies at all. They just seem to because he refuses to sympathize with his characters.

When the household staff has a class system, things have gotten out of hand.Eclectic and occasionally confusing, but intriguing all the same, Gosford Park follows a group of uppity socialites and their help at a weekend shooting party in the home of Sir William and Lady Sylvia McCordle (Michael Gambon and Kristin Scott Thomas).  Among the guests Sylvia's sister and brother-in-law (Geraldine Somerville and Charles Dance), haughty dowager aunt Constance (Maggie Smith, exuding icy elegance and nonchalant cruelty), and film idol Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam).  Central figures among the help include Constance's maid Mary (Kelly MacDonald), housemaid Elsie (Emily Watson), and housekeeper Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren).To trace all the history, affairs, and secrets between the occupants would not only be very time-consuming, but difficult--even after two-and-a-half hours, I still don't have all the details down (though trying to puzzle it out kept me interested in the film).  While the confusion is a bit disconcerting, I can't help but think this might have been the idea that Robert Altman is mocking the convoluted and incomprehensible mess these people have made from their lives, resulting in a web so tangled they can no longer see what's right in front of their noses.Due to the facts that a) nearly every room in the house seems to contain a bottle or two of poison, b) one of the knifes goes missing from the silver drawer and c) Sir William is not exactly Father Christmas and makes enemies on a regular basis, it becomes clear that the gentleman is not long for this world.  When the murder does take place, the investigation is conducted by one Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry, with some of the best comic moments in the film).  Hercule Poirot he's not; Thompson is content to question the family and friends in a vague manner while his partner does the real forensics.  It hardly matters, as the point is not on whodunnit (the motive and identity of the killer are the most easily determined points in the plot), but on the blindness of the characters entirely absorbed in their own lives they not only cannot determine who killed Sir William, they don't seem to care much about it in the first place.  Even the servants are self-absorbed when one of their number proves to be not all he said, they ostracize him with an offended pride worthy of anyone above stairs.The ensemble cast is fine and universally solid.  Smith gives the strongest performance, providing Constance with all the hypocracy and hauteur of an Austen villianess.  MacDonald, the closest thing the film has to a central character, conveys sweetness and genuine appeal as Mary.  She resembles nothing so much as Alice down the rabbit-hole a sane human being curiously regarding the insanity around her.  Watson is also notable, bring an interesting mix of cynicism and wistfulness to the role of Elsie.  Even the peripheral characters provide strong, captivating performances.  You wouldn't want to live at Gosford Park, but it's a nice place to visit.

I must look forward to the DVD with its subtitle capability. Otherwise, I've lost half the dialogue in the mix of gabby characters and roving camera.However, the film is rich in cars, costuming, and upstairs/downstairs for a delightful take on wealth and class rigidity of England in 1932. It's a weekend shooting party at Gosford Park; the host, Sir William, played crustily by Michael Gambon, has the temerity to be self made and necessary to the financial stability of many attending aristocrats.The German situation is not an issue and the fragile world economy is obliquely hinted at only in the desperate finances of a few fawning relatives.The drama is downstairs, coordinated by Helen Mirren and Alan Bates as the embodiment of the stiff upper lip of the lower orders.  Although an aristocrat says about a servant overhearing a conversation,  `Don't worry, he's nobody,' Altman makes the servants so pervasive that they are actually every bodies. An aristocrat impersonating a servant is told bluntly, `You can't be on both teams at once.' It's tough downstairs.Upstairs the reigning snob is Maggie Smith's countess.  An unforgettable conveyor of the putdown, she is never better than when cutting on the bourgeois film star and the fussing American producer. Neither belongs in her frigid world.The actual murder mystery is a plot device, seemingly unimportant to the guests and the director.  The film rests on the tension surrounding the classes, birthrights, birth parents, and access to power and money.  For these themes and his layers of superb actors, Altman is the ultimate ringmaster. For atmosphere and style, Altman is worth every bit of lost dialogue.

The biggest comedic relief of this reading is the reference by so many to this film as a comedy and/or mystery. It's a drawing room drama of near epic proportions. The producers/directors seemed to want to throw it all in, and the crime part of the thing surely was not intended to be taken seriously. Blake Edwards may have recognized that police inspector, but Agatha Christie would have shuddered. She didn't do comedies, and her detectives were expert and successful. And, how can this be a whodunit when they show you who did it?? Clearly, everyone connected with the project worked hard. And they got their A's for effort. And a big Q for quantity, but 0 for quality. No matter how much talent you assemble, rabbits pulled out of hats, it all just gets lost in the jabbering herd. A lot of people are referencing this movie right now because of the huge current following of PBS' Downton Abbey. There are comparisons of site and theme and so forth. So, it sends one to or back to GP. It no doubt was ground breaking, in proportion at least, for its type and in its time -- but it has been majorly eclipsed with Abbey. Somehow, the more civil versions of this theme have surpassed offerings of this sort. You can scream artistic expression in many categories on this, but the period films (or other) that are the most revisited (and awarded as well) are not of this ilk. These characters don't live on. Who could even remember half of them? That's not the case with other period films of the type and subject, which have and are becoming classics, like Downton Abbey, one in the works - undeniably a smash hit.There's a problem today with confusing filthy talk and wholesale shoddy behavior with realism. Again, the characters that become real to people are not from films that attempt to standardize lower forms of human nature and expression. People have a way of wanting to spend their time and revisit works that reflect upward from dysfunction, with liberal sprinklings of sleaze. Sorry, but that's basically what you've got here. It may be a part of real life, but most people really aren't impressed by it, nor seek it as entertainment. Adult themes can be represented without being crammed down your throat. Applause to those with the artistic skill and human depth to bring that off. Unfortunately, that did not happen here. Innovative spectacle for its time -- a reach for a positive commentary.

Altman had crafted the ensemble cast concept into a visual delight - M*A*S*H and Nashville spring instantly to mind. But, like the saying goes, all good things must come to an end and Gosford Park is definitely the end of Altman's creative spark. Altman proved that an ensemble cast of 15 people could be a rare confection indeed. Under his skillful control he was always aware of how a good plot and subtle character nuances could bring out the best in his characters&#x97;and hence the story.

At the beginning it seems to fit with this profile as an array of guests make their way to a large house in the English countryside. However, as the film progresses, it becomes apparent that this is not a mystery in the Agatha Christie sense, rather it is primarily focused on showing the lives of the characters in great depth and highlighting class distinctions in Britain as they were in the 1930s.The film has a number of good points. Sets and costumes were very well-crafted and impressive. The film was well-scored and particularly notable was the ditties sung by Ivor Novello while he played the piano. Notable performances come from a great cast and the film has its brilliant moments, particularly when we learn key details about the shrouded characters.However, observing the rituals of the house in between the film's top moments became tedious. The film seemed to be picking up steam when the promised murder took place. However, the last part of the film ultimately did not gain significant momentum after the murder. Stephen Fry's character was amusing initially when he could not seem to speak his full name without being interrupted, but his bumbling approach to investigating the murder was unfortunate. However, the movie does provide an interesting conclusion as the final details of key characters are revealed.Gosford Park is well-filmed, but the fact that the mystery aspect is deemphasized relative to exploring the conventions of the house left me disappointed. If you are looking for an Agatha Christie type mystery, look elsewhere. But if a thorough exploration of English society and class distinctions in 1930s Britain appeals to you, see Gosford Park.

However, whats interesting is that it's not just the guests who are important, the servants control the plot as well to an equal if not greater extent. The movie explores the relationships that the guests have with each other as well as with their servants.The cast is top-notch. The ever-glorious Maggie Smith who plays the role of Lady Trentham nails her character. Tart, condescending and snobbish, she revels in her role of old English gentry.I have never seen Kelly Macdonald act before, but I was very impressed by her performance. Cast as the maid Mary Maceachran waiting on lady Trentham, she manages to portray the necessary timidity and meekness, at the same time convincing the viewer of her understated loyalty and honest simplicity.Kristin Scott Thomas has a sizable role as Sylvia McCordle, the wife of the host. Hers I found somewhat of a complex character, for it was hard to fathom her out at once. The shades to her character were revealed very gradually over the course of the movie. But Thomas pulls it off very deftly, the transitions are smooth, and one learns about her as the story unfolds.Ryan Phillippe, perhaps obvious in a different sense for he stands out as an American actor among largely English co-stars, of mention-ably high pedigree. All may not agree with his performance, but I felt Phillippe held his own. As the valet to Mr.Weissman, he seems from the start as the the odd one out among the rest of the servants. And this is obvious to almost everyone who works down below stairs with him. His interaction with the others is intriguing to watch as they all suspect him of hiding some secret.Helen Mirren is another one of the fine English actresses in this film. She plays the role of Mrs. Wilson, the housekeeper who essentially runs the whole show and the servants as well, much to their annoyance. She seems like a hard-hearted woman, who shuns the company of other human beings and can't abide anything other than subservient behavior from the domestics who are under her reign. All this plays out for most of the initial movie, but gradually we glimpse the cracks beneath the surface, which lead us to see that there is more to this women that meets the eye.Also notable among the cast are Clive Owen as the valet Robert Parks, who doesn't seem to be all that interested in valeting and Emily Watson as the maid Elsie. Watson I think does a really good job playing a maid who seems to want more from life than just waiting on people, but at the same time is tied to her employer for a very different reason.Summing it up, Gosford Park delivers.

Instead, we drift through the house, upstairs and downstairs, watching the events of a shooting weekend at a magnificent old-money house in the (very rainy) English countryside, piecing together characters by catching a snippet of conversation here, a liaison there.We're watching from the point of view of the servants (there's one in every scene). Some characters are more thoroughly explored than others, but even those who aren't particularly foregrounded feel like people we aren't really getting to know rather than underdeveloped extras. As a result, a few of the plot lines (especially the two involving letters) are obscured in the general texture of the piece, and some are never resolved at all, but again this feels deliberate - we catch intriguing glimpses, but do not get to know the whole story. If this sounds frustrating, let me assure you that it's entirely the opposite - it makes everything even more absorbing. Like life, we don't get all the answers.There is a plot, in the classic whodunnit style, but to concentrate on this plot is to miss the point of the film entirely. That said, the secrets brought to light by the murder are heartbreaking, and 'who' is nowhere near as significant as 'why'. But the focus of this film (such as it is) is on the subtly developing characters, the rich production design and the satisfaction of feeling things fall into place in your head as you mentally assemble the various plots and characters from the details you've managed to 'overhear'.The film leaves me with a feeling of melancholy - of nostalgic regret that such a grand (albeit classist and exploitative) way of life had to end, and that change is on the way.

You know why nobody cares about the murder, because nobody, even his wife, really cared about who was murdered.  Isn't that the real crime here?  These characters are so full of themselves, that the death only means a slight step up on the totem pole.Another thing that I want to say about this film, is that after having seen Black Hawk Down a couple of days ago, this movie is as much a technically visual masterpiece as the Ridley Scott film.  The use of foreground and background is simply amazing.  The choreography and blocking of the movement is perfect.  Is it rigid? Yup.  And that's the point.It's a shame that movies like this are refered to as boring and stiff. One reviewer suggested that it would work as a thirty minute short as opposed to a nearly two and half hour long movie.  That seems like a ridiculous notion to me because then all it would have been a murder mystery as opposed to what a wonderfully filmed character drama.And hey, I didn't remember a single name either.  Maybe people who have criticized this movie for that should look back and see how many movies they remember all the names of all the characters upon the first viewing.  My thought is that most of the names are inconsequential anyhow.

For him, authority is to be mocked, morality to be shown as hypocritical, conventions as exercises in preservation of power or privilege, virtue is either the booby prize of the loser or merely the sanctimony of the narrowly stupid.Instead, the hero is always the rebel - the one outside respectable society who wishes to upset - often humorously - all convention and morality. This is typical of his movies - this one is set not in South Korea in the 1950s or the Old West or contemporary Paris but in an English country house in 1932.  Altman's interest here is to reflect on the cruelty of class differences in Britain of the 1930s, hidden by the social structure of the day. A murder mystery is simply the device employed (and amateurishly so).It may assist some to know that this is a weekend house/shooting party at a country estate in northeast England (Northumberland) in 1932. The hosts are a wealthy and able man who is married to a younger woman -they have one daughter. They invite the wife's relations to visit a) her two sisters (and their husbands), b) the three sisters' aunt, c) a man and his homely wife (invited through a connection with their daughter), d) a distant cousin of the host who should provide entertainment (an actor who has brought an American movie producer and apparent servant in tow), and e) a friend of the daughter who has brought someone he seeks to set up with her. Oh yes, there are valets and maids who come with almost all of them - and a full staff at the house.The movie is interesting socially - with the great agricultural depression of the late 19th century (farm prices were depressed due to worldwide competition from more efficiently farmed and transported crops around the world), land has ceased to be able to create and support great fortunes. Between 1870 and 1900, vast numbers of members of the upper class have moved into the commercial arena they once disdained. With the Liberal Government that entered in 1909 - and even more with the Government policies of the 1920s and 1930s - taxation has begun to crimp the retention of wealth between generations - through inheritance taxes, property taxes, graduated income taxes. After World War I, servants are more difficult to find and retain - and far more expensive due to alternative possible employment. With the coming of the Depression, the upper class (now in the trade they once disdained) has been nearly as affected as in America. The host's business acumen and resulting wealth makes him a lifeboat for many. He knows it - but for him, business is business.A privileged class has therefore found itself in jeopardy - and this is evident in the many subplots among the upper class in this movie.Altman is a deeply cynical and rebellious man - and most of his movie sets out to kick the upper class for its purported affectations, snobberies, vanity, cold-heartedness, and general inhumanity. However, he does still allow some affecting portraits of devotion - whether it is Derek Jacobi (the host's valet) to the host, or the maid Dorothy's devotion to the head butler, or the affection borne the host by his sister-in-law or by one of the maids, or the feeling of one  husband toward his wife.I sympathize with those who didn't understand the identity of the murderer, but suggest they simply pay better attention. The movie, and the relationships of the characters, are better understood on second viewing - things are said that presage later conduct, you understand better why some people accompany others. This is a fine movie - but careful attention must be paid. It should not be taken as a last word on the upper class or class differences of the time. (A striking contrast is shown in Remains of the Day). However, it is an intelligent take - and a closely observed one.

Experiencing it with a French audience no doubt enhanced its power to reinforce the feeling of being in voluntary exile from Britain. Today I have been haunted by recurrent images of the servants' domain, a warren of low corridors, cramped rooms and frantic industry that I had never seen before. The grandeur of life upstairs we have all seen many times, but never in such a context of servants' lives. The image was of a workhouse or factory jammed into the basement of a palace. Factories play a significant role in the story the lord of the manor owns several and a number of the servants started out in them. Imagine what life in the factories was like (the film is set in the 1930s) if domestic service of this kind was a step up.The overwhelming tenor of the society is one of brutality. The owners behave savagely towards the servants and to each other. The servants reproduce this in their own hierarchies. Only Americans could have made this movie, since the British are still seduced by the national glory the lifestyle represents. The plot is eventually a murder mystery, but no-one pays much notice to the victim, since it seems to be a natural expression of the culture he embodied. Gosford Park is so parodic of the Agatha Christie genre invented in this period as to point up the bitterness of the social satire. There are not many jokes.What then is this magnificent cast of British actors doing in such a movie? Many of the greatest of them on show perform as servants the superb Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi, Alan Bates, Eileen Atkins. Some of the others create memorable upper class monsters Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott-Thomas. Does this express what they feel about their role in a British society dependent on Americans to make films? The creaking plot device of an invasion of Hollywood types doesn't quite work, but it does allow us to see the British as others see them.What makes this film tragic for me is that it depicts the appallingly recent source of a contemporary Britain that has not shaken off the loss of an empire it made in the image of the society revealed here. I grew up after the war, but my journey from the provincial lower classes to Oxbridge and beyond constantly exposed me to the residue of this brutal class hierarchy. It is the mark of a great movie to make us feel that we are seeing something new. Altman has done us all a favour by exposing upstairs/downstairs without any hint of mystique. I wonder if, when seen through the cultural blinkers of London's suburbs, it provokes nostalgia, not pity, if only to witness so many of our greatest actors as servants looking their age.

But he sometimes loses hold on the basic storytelling and emotional aspects of a film, losing at least part of the viewer's involvement. That's no small flaw, in the end, and Gosford Park, like The Player, is both admirable and cold, virtuosic and needlessly busy and clever. So watch it for the details more than the plot, which is smart enough if you can keep up with all the details, some more pertinent than others. The mise-en-scene is utterly convincing (and house or houses used for shooting is beyond perfect for it). The class structure, and the interplay between classes, is played with constantly, and with wit. The blocking of scenes (the movement of characters in the space) is complex and involving. And the camera-work is subtle and beautiful, and varied. Note how often the camera moves just slightly toward, and around, an actor being singled out, giving a fluidity to watching. Indeed, this could have been a really horrible movie, a bore, a confusing morass. But it is so well made it is worth watching, and maybe, for a film student, worth studying. The acting, on top of it all, is superb, Clive Owen and his confident diffidence not the least of the great roles.But the distractions persist. The annoying and oddly inconsequential American, for one of several characters who might better have been left out. And why all the subplots between some of those upstairs meant to recreate the haughty snobbery of the scene but little else? The confusion, even while paying attention, doesn't so much make you rapt but make you glaze over. "},{"Title":"Complex and Demanding, but Never Boring","Date":"19 March 2007","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" One November weekend in 1932, a group of guests assemble at Gosford Park, the country seat of Sir William McCordle, for a shooting party. During the course of the weekend Sir William is found dead, apparently stabbed to death, in his study. This scenario recalls the classic English country house murder mystery popularised by Agatha Christie. There was a vogue for filming Christie's novels in the seventies and eighties, but today she is widely regarded as quaint and old-fashioned. It was, therefore, something of a surprise to see Robert Altman, a director with a reputation for being forward-looking and experimental, making a film based upon what could easily have been a Christie plot, although Julian Fellowes's screenplay was in fact an original one.Yet in some respect Altman's style is suited to a murder mystery. One of his trademarks is the use of multiple story lines involving a large (and normally all-star) cast, and this fits in well with the traditional murder story, in which it is necessary to establish that there were a considerable number of people with a motive to commit the crime. This is what happens in Gosford Park; there is no one obvious suspect because Sir William was a highly unpleasant individual and most of the people present in the house had good cause to dislike him. (For example, he had threatened to cut off the allowance paid to his sister Lady Constance).That does not mean, however, that the film is a pastiche of the likes of The Mirror Crack'd or Evil under the Sun. The first half of the film is taken up with introducing the characters and establishing the relations between them. Whereas the traditional murder mystery concentrates very much on the relations between the eventual murder victim and those persons who will later be suspected of his or her murder, in Gosford Park there is a much more complex web of interrelationships. This enables Fellowes to concentrate not only on those upstairs- the McCordle family and their guests- but also on those downstairs- the servants who work in the basement. (Interestingly, one of the servants is played by Eileen Atkins, one of the creators of Upstairs, Downstairs, a well-known British TV series from the seventies which also portrayed life in a wealthy household and in which the servants also played as important a role as their master and his family).The social structure revealed in this film is a complicated one. For all his baronial pretensions, Sir William's wealth derives from his ownership of factories in the London suburbs, something which in the eyes of the traditional landed aristocracy and gentry would be enough to damn him as new money. (We learn that in his younger days he was a notorious sexual predator, preying on his factory girls, and his habit of fondling attractive young female servants suggest that he has not changed his ways in old age). We see the arrival of an even newer moneyed class in the persons of Ivor Novello (who was a real-life actor, singer and composer of the period) and Morris Weissman, an American film producer in England to learn something of country house life in preparation for a film he is making. (Ironically, also a murder mystery). It is not only life upstairs that has a hierarchical structure; the servants' hall has a hierarchy of its own, in which a valet outranks a footman but is outranked by a butler.Another difference between this film and the traditional whodunit is that there is no omniscient detective to act as a Deus ex machina and resolve the mystery at the end. Unlike, say, Hercule Poirot, Stephen Fry's policeman is a minor, and rather comic, figure. It is a much more unlikely character who actually solves the mystery.The film's cast list reads like a Who's Who of the British acting profession. There is not space enough here to praise all those who deserve it, but I must single out exceptionally fine contributions from Maggie Smith as Lady Constance, Helen Mirren as the housekeeper, Kelly Macdonald as the Scottish maid, Alan Bates as the drunken butler Jennings, and Clive Owen as Robert Parks, a young man who harbours a long-standing grudge against Sir William.The film also features another of Altman's trademark devices, the use of overlapping conversations. I have never been a great admirer of this device, but in Gosford Park, however, it seems to work, making for greater realism without (as it sometimes does) sacrificing comprehension. Altman and Fellowes succeed in taking a traditional, often hackneyed, genre, and putting it to fresh use, both as a character study of a diverse group of characters and as an exploration of social issues. The result is a complex and often demanding film. Unlike some reviewers, however, I never found it a boring one. 8/10 "}{"Title":"I was rooting for this for Best Picture.","Date":"19 February 2006","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" In what may be Robert Altman's best movie since McCabe and Mrs. Miller, a plethora of aristocrats and their servants come to an estate in rural England in 1932 for a hunting party.

Moreover, this movie's prominence when it came out gave Altman a chance to take a swipe at George W. Bush. Julian Fellowes took home an Oscar for his screenplay (I was rooting for this movie for Best Picture). And now that the Academy is giving Altman an honorary Oscar at the upcoming ceremony, I think that it affirms everything that I've just said here.When Ryan Philippe starred in I Know What You Did Last Summer, who ever would have guessed that he would co-star with Miss Jean Brodie a few years later?

There are way too many characters to keep track of; indeed, there are forty-four speaking parts in this film. Also, the film's structure is mostly set-up, which requires viewer patience, as one plods through the meandering first act. And, the English accents are extreme, perhaps intentionally, and thus render an added burden for American viewers.Alternately, one could view the film as a study in contrasting social class structure and behavior, under one roof, in 1930's England. From this perspective, the film's production design and costumes engender respect. The viewer gets a feel for the atmosphere of the above stairs English aristocracy of the era, and the corresponding atmosphere of the servant class, below stairs. The best approach here is to absorb the overall ambiance, as the details quickly become tedious and tiresome.But mostly, Gosford Park is a study of Robert Altman's directorial style of storytelling, as nonlinear, animated art. This contrasts to Agatha Christie's style as linear, animated algebra. In Altman's paradigm, you gaze at selected parts. Your eye's movement, or rather the camera's, is random. You look here, you look there, at a kaleidoscope of human interaction; you see tiny bits of the whole. What you do not do is progress in a rigid, linear fashion from point A to point B in the drama, which in a classic sense, leads logically to point C; hence, the film's high character count and multiple plot lines. They are there on purpose, to enhance fragmentation, and to frustrate solutions.All of this can be unsettling to casual moviegoers who expect a traditional whodunit. What they get instead is directorial slight of hand, or misdirection, as it were. Indeed, my opinion is that this film is not even aimed at the general public, apart from revenue. The film's underlying message is aimed at intellectuals, serious film critics, Hollywood insiders, and most of all at ... posterity. And that message pertains to the art of film-making.When one becomes as well known as Altman, and reaches a certain age in life, perhaps it is natural to want to leave to posterity your philosophy of film, your artistic vision. You want to leave a lasting imprint, as a director. For Robert Altman, Gosford Park is that imprint. In this context then, the wants and expectations of the movie going public is ... irrelevant.

Robert Altman cut his teeth on big, multi-layered ensemble pieces like Nashville and Short Cuts. Even his break-through film, MASH, had a large number of characters and discordant stories running through it as well as an almost blatant disregard for conventional narrative. Still, you might have been forgiven for thinking that a British country house melodrama complete with body in the library and set in 1932 was beyond his range. Far from it. This wonderfully quick-witted movie is quite the equal of his very best work. The humour is certainly there in Julian Fellowes' script and the murder plot is something on an old chestnut, (the denouement is almost something of an irrelevance). What matters is the detail and Altman gets it right with an almost documentary-like precision. He is equally adept in dealing with the vagaries of those upstairs and down, (there is a pecking order among the servants, too), in a way that would not have disgraced Renoir. Indeed the film is at its best when picking away at the social mores, not just of the rich and their snobbish attitude to 'new' money but of those who serve them, (servants judge servants as much as by who they are and where they come from as their masters).In this, of course, Altman is greatly helped by his magnificent cast. It would be insidious to single any one performer out from another, so I won't, suffice to say that down to the tiniest part this is an extremely well-acted film. And like the best of Altman's work there is a wonderfully improvisatory feel to Julian Fellowes' screenplay. The original idea was Altman's and the actor Bob Balaban's, who also appears in the film. For the sake of entertainment they give us some broad comedy and a silly murder mystery by way of Agatha Christe presided over by a bumblingly daft Inspector of Clouseau-like incompetence played by Stephen Fry. But you know instinctively that this is not the real reason for Gosford Park. This is a precise and stingingly accurate piece of social history. I can't think of another director who could have pulled it off other than, maybe, Lindsay Anderson who seems to have been au fait with both sides of this particular coin.

In fact, at this point I feel more of an affinity for his last film, the unfairly despised Dr. T and the Women.Still, one can't at all watch Gosford Park without being amazed at it. It ranks along with the many great European films in this tradition. It is undoubtedly most influenced by Rules of the Game, directed by Jean Renoir in 1939. That film generally ranks at #2 out of every film ever made on the Sight and Sound polls, taken every decade (they're to be taken this year, 2002, for the seventh time since the poll's founding).

These films all play with the relations between the master and servant class in varying degrees. Godford Park is perhaps the most complex in that respect it gives equal time to both sides, allowing for a lot of character identification. It also contains an enormous cast, as you might expect from Altman, and all of the characters are perfectly developed, also as you might expect. The acting is brilliant. Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith were singled out by Oscar voters, both receiving a Best Supporting Actress nomination, but I don't know how they chose between the two dozen actors and actresses in order to arrive at those two. Everyone is equal to them, and I imagine a lot of the actors who didn't make it were suggested by the Academy members. The direction, of course, is beautiful. It's on par with the rest of Altman - I don't think he's ever directed poorly, even in his bad films. The score is beautiful. Stephen Altman's production design is miraculous - it was nominated for an Oscar, but defeated by Moulin Rouge!. Moulin Rouge! is merely showy. The production design here is subtle as hell.I do find some fault in the script. Most of it is brilliant. It won the Oscar for Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. I would have chosen Memento myself, but Gosford Park is nearly as deserving. The dialogue is always spot on, and the plot is fantastic - that is, until the murder. I'm not going to spoil anything, unless you didn't know that there was a murder (sorry if you didn't, but it was in all the ads!). It's just that the murder feels forced - a lot like the murder in Rules of the Game. It just never seems necessary, and what results from it is not as interesting as I would have hoped for. There's also a ton of setup for the murder in the plot, with tons of bottles of poison being shown and the victim nearly getting shot and so forth. And not enough results from it. The mystery is also not interesting. It was much more interesting - and in line with the theme - when the two groups were simply interacting. The explanation doesn't say anything that wasn't already implied, and some of the unforeseen relationships between the characters don't add as much weight to the drama as they are meant to.That's all a rather minor criticism, to tell the truth. It still works, it's just not as strong as I think it could have (or should have) been. Of course, Gosford Park does qualify as one of the best films of the year and a very worthy addition to Robert Altman's stunning cinema. I've seen around a dozen of his films, and, while I really haven't ranked many a 10/10 (only Nashville, very nearly my favorite film, and 3 Women), Altman has the rare distinction of producing a body of work that is actually greater than the sum of its parts. I give Gosford Park a 9/10.

It was fun to see so many familiar faces, especially Maggie Smith from 'Downton Abbey' (which was made as sort of a sequel by the producers of this film - as I understand it). Laurence Fox (DC Hathaway in the TV-series 'Lewis') may easily be missed, since his part is very small. For the rest of them, just check the IMDb cast list.'Gosford park' is a somewhat chaotic movie. It's pretty hard to figure out who's who and what is exactly going on in all the nooks and crannies of the big estate, but if you stay focused, a first viewing should offer enough information to get the gist of things. There is of course a murder mystery, but not until late into the film. The most important themes aren't revealed until even later, either, so what remains for the bulk of the time, is the doings and dealings of the upstairs and downstairs population, which I found quite entertaining and intriguing to observe. The addition of an American movie director talking about making a detective film, was rather funny. And there's plenty more parts like that, of which I must mention Stephen Fry's detective character.Maybe the story is quite contrived, but it worked for me and Robert Altman's direction is always a pleasure to witness. There's a lot of fine acting here (of course), but I will probably never become a fan of Clive Owen; something about his presence is just plain dull to me.Good fun was had by all, so to say. 8 out of 10.

It turns out that even the tiniest details and bits of business in the film -- food and drink, clothing, pecking order, salutations, customs, rules of etiquette, etc. -- were carefully thought out and as authentic as Fellowes could make them. (He's also, for what it's worth, refreshingly generous when it comes to giving credit to his actors.)Altman also contributes a commentary on the DVD, but (like his commentary on Nashville) it's quite disappointing. He sounds old, a bit dim, and a little past it, as if he hasn't seen the movie in years and has forgotten most of it. That's okay; Gosford is still, to my mind, his best movie, and we do have Fellowes to interpret it for us.

It is a murder mystery although the focus is on class. Plot centers upon a hunting party that arrives at the estate. They are observed through the eyes of their ever present servants. There is a murder and director Robert Altman makes everyone a suspect because everyone has a motive. This is remarkable craft by Altman who not only masters mystery elements but also an ensemble of characters that often appear together within the same frame. Altman's previous works include such classics as Nashville and M.A.S.H. Helen Mirren plays the strict head servant who keeps everything in order. Emily Watson is also a servant who gets caught up in an affair. Kelly MacDonald is the one servant who guides viewers through these events. She is portrayed as an innocent who tells of nothing outside of fact. Maggie Smith plays an elderly guest who belts out the funniest lines. Stephen Fry brings great comic relief as an inspector in that Sherlock Holmes tradition. Everyone delivers flawless performances as they interact within each scene and plotted social event. The story is set in 1932 and backed with exquisite art direction and a theme of wealth, class and placement render it one of Altman's greatest achievements.

If I was in a party, my guests would be the Gosford Park ones for sure, it even includes Ivor Novello, the star who's most famous role was in the silent Hitchcock masterpiece The Lodger. This film received the Academy Award for best screenplay (in the same year as Mulholland Drive), the plot was classical, but it still held my attention and even made me laugh throughout the 2h11m. The dialogs and the characters (that I've already mentioned) were very good and the adaptations by the actors were great too, not to mention the photography that I enjoyed a lot. For anyone who has seen Luis Bu√±uel Exterminating Angel before, will find some similarities, they both showed a dark side of the high society, but Gosford Park a even more degrading one, yet, still humorous.

It's like a ironic documentary, a scientist's experimental setting, of people and classes who are placed together in a closed surrounding, meeting each other, moving upwards and downwards, leading their own lives, being dependent on each other and pretending not to care. I just love the movie. Can see it over and over again - when you know the plot, you can drop the subtitles and concentrate even more on the whole. I love the extremely well worked-out interiors. Everything in that movie is done with a crazy care for detail up to the choice of cars (snobbish ladyship Trentham in a ways too old, once elegant model, the young folk in a sportive Bentley), the complexity of tasks, tools and handwork that the servants perform all the time, the subtle hints of the camera to what's going to take place... That movie shows a whole society in a nutshell. And when you know HOW it was done - with the advice of real servants on the set, original jewelery, right clothes and a lot of acting carefully like in the real old movies - you understand why it's so convincing. I love the complexity of the plot. So many lives and stories in that little universe every person's important. And never seen a more convincing way of telling important facts to the viewer in a very natural way. I loved the personages, and am still moved to tears at the end. No way, ten stars.

Altman, like Welles, uses the movement of the camera in the most adventurous ways, and in this respect alone this is a great ride. The camera moves so effortlessly amongst people it's exhilarating to watch. The hallways, corners, doors and the stairs. Everything is so beautifully dynamic.Not to mention that this is skillfully written and atmospheric. Most of the film is all about the dynamics between the people and how the camera, being one of them, sets in to the house. So we also as an audience are given our time to get acquainted with the labyrinth of a house, the corridors, stairs and especially the two overlapping lives of the people involved the masters above and their servants below. The great mystery is ultimately solved so elliptically that we realize it wasn't even the real mystery of the film to begin with. And of course there's the self- referential stuff of an actor playing a servant, and a film-producer making a Charlie Chan crime mystery into which the reality they're trying to emulate transforms itself.My favourite Altman by far.

For the first half-hour, I found myself struggling to engage with the very loose narrative, eclectic characters, and dry, relatively ordinary conversations that lacked commonality or relatability on my behalf. After half-an-hour or so, Altman's motives became more clear to me. After an hour and a half, they were beyond crystal. Then the last forty-eight minutes became something of a slog for the mind and the heart.Altman's grandscale film will wow some people, bore others, alienate, detach, enchant, invigorate, and intrigue - some, like me, will experience all of those at least once - in its 138-minute runtime. A film like this deserved praise alone because its craft will be disposed of by some or justified and cherished by others. I doubt two will have the same ideas after viewing the picture as well. It's the kind of film where while you're watching it, you're already planning when you'll see it next.The film's story seems conventional and relatively cheap material, until Altman's intentions and direction becomes more vivid. It depicts a large gathering of wealthy Britons and their servants at the luxurious country house named Gosford Park. Actors such as Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Charles Dance, Stephen Fry, and Clive Owen portray these people, as they gather for a lavish weekend of shooting a film. However, if social classes and net worth weren't the only thing from dividing many of them, a murder occurs in the country house, leaving guests scrambling and searching for the killer and a possible motive. It doesn't help that half the house already hates another half of the house for some reason or another either.It took me about half an hour - well before the first murder event occurs - to realize the film attempts to show the mannerisms, behavior, and social classes of a large, selected group of Britons as they gather together for a weekend of enjoyment that turns into calamity. Altman has little interest in making this film a murder mystery or a film that relies heavily on clues. It's not about piecing it together; rather, it's about embracing culture and existing as a class-study, if anything.I feel that if you don't recognize this at some point during the film - or even before seeing it - your experience will be a boring and rather uneventful one. Because of this stylistic and rather meticulous focus added to the story, Gosford Park is sort of a challenge to watch even after you recognize it. However, it's a beautiful piece in regards to the acting and the slowburn writing, which many directors and writers would undoubtedly find a task to do. Altman doesn't really care if you agree with methods of storytelling; I'm not even sure he cares if you watch them. He wants to make his mark and go from there. His mark is definitely made with Gosford Park.Starring Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Charles Dance, Stephen Fry, Michael Gambon, Richard E.

A murder occurs after a dinner party and the film goes on to present the subsequent investigation into it from both the servants' and the guests' perspectives.It was written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman.Sir William McCordle and his wife Lady Sylvia are a pair of wealthy British socialites who have invited a variety of friends, relatives, and acquaintances to their mansion in the country for a weekend of hunting and relaxation. Among the honored guests are Constance, Lady Sylvia's matronly aunt; Ivor Novello, William's cousin who is also a well-known actor and songwriter; and Morris Weissman, an American film producer who is friendly with Ivor and researching an upcoming project. Observing the proceedings are the domestic staff of the mansion, including imperious butler Jennings (Alan Bates); footmen George and Arthur; Probert, a valet to Sir William; housekeeper Mrs. Wilson; Mrs. Croft, who oversees the kitchen; and Elsie, a maid. Also on hand are the guests' personal servants, including Mary, Constance's maid; Henry, Weissman's valet; and Parks, a butler. While the servants are required to display a high level of decorum, they are expected to be passive observers who do not comment on what they see, though the gossip among them travels thick and fast once they retire to the servants' quarters downstairs. And it turns out that there's plenty worth gossiping about, especially after Sir William turns up dead, and everyone is ordered to stay at the mansion while the police investigate the killing. This is a scintillating comedy-drama and one of Altman's most richly moving and entertaining pictures as contents and style converge smoothly and seductively in this luxuriant period drama that applies Agatha Christie murder-mystery format to a rigorous anatomy of British class structure in the 1930s, with all the who's who in U.K. in the cast.Also,it juggles about thirty different characters, moving them from the upper-class upstairs to the servants' quarters and the movie does so without losing the audience.It is is slow, but it does eventually lead of to a murder,which happens to be the main focus of the film, but at the same time it emphasizes the entangled relationships of everyone in the house. I think that's the reason this film succeeds despite of its negative flaws which makes it at least a good film but not a great one.

I'm a rather laid back guy who isn't much impressed by the snootiness of socialites and those who think they're better than the rest. So it's rather revealing to be a voyeur into this 1930's world of English royalty and see that, you know what, they're really no better than the rest.As a movie fan, I was also quite intrigued with the constant movie references, and was quick to recognize Ivor Norvello's name as an actor of the era who appeared in the film mentioned in the story. In fact, just like the murder victim here, the real Norvello actually did it twice! The first time was for Hitchcock in a 1927 silent picture - it's actual title The Lodger A Story of the London Fog. Five years later, Norvello reprised his original role in the first talkie remake of The Lodger titled The Phantom Fiend. For me it's a toss-up choosing between the two, as they each have somewhat different endings for essentially the same story.What's really cleverly done here is the actual murder itself. Though the identity of the killer we see is kept under wraps, it's not until the story progresses that we learn that Sir William McCordle was already dead by the time he was 'stabbed to death'. As intriguing as the story is up to that point, it gets even more mysterious on the way to revealing the real participants in the crime and their relationship to each other.Obviously this won't be every movie viewer's cup of English tea, as it plays out over a two hour span, and as mentioned earlier, nothing really seems to go on until the pheasant hunt and the eventual murder. However if you have some patience, you'll be rewarded with an insider's view of life both upstairs and downstairs as it were, and see just how catty both the upper and lower crusts can be. All as a backdrop for a stylish whodunit in a grand setting. Charlie Chan would have been proud.

Without getting as picky as many other reviews floating around, I'd say this cross of an Agatha Christie Ms. Marple mixed with Howard's End. Even then, I'm making it seem quite dark - which it isn't. This is the most entertaining ensemble piece I've seen in a very long time and Altman has an effortless touch with so many legendary actors crammed into an old house around a dead body.In a sense, there's almost too much going on for the film's own good. In the last third, some characters drift in and out of the narrative simply because the plot gets in the way which is a disappointment compared to the first chunk of the film. Before the body turns up, it's less a forced setup for suspects than a supreme exercise in just hanging out. Howard Hawks made a western in the same style with John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan and Ricky Nelson called Rio Bravo. There too do we get caught up in the daily musings and sing song of some old friends locked in a jail house. There too does the film lose steam when the story gets in the way. But here, one must congratulate Altman for corralling so much talent and funneling it into something genuinely entertaining and, at times, even absorbing.Gosford Park is a victim of it's quality. There's so much to see and so much to tell, when he gets around to making a movie out of it, it's just not as interesting as what came before. Even so, there's few other movies I've seen in the last 20 years that offer so much for your time.

But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade of Altman's goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Altman has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today.

He trusts this kind of motion to be real. What he requires is that his camera is one of the company, improvises along and is in turn imbued with a real gaze. The collaborative process is akin to a jazz ensemble; everyone in turns providing rhythm and soloing where is room to do so. Usually he tries to spin two or more plates together so that every story-specific notion bounces back and forth increasingly abstract. In Nashville it was politics and music. In his genre films, the genre is one of the plates and always deconstructed.So another Altman film; another large cast mostly stellar and acquitting themselves well, whodunit for the genre. Another layer referencing class relations in 1930's England and trusting these haven't changed a hell of a lot so that we hang on them our own frustrations.Upstairs mingles aristocracy about to be swept aside by the tide of events. There is wanton secrecy and intrigue, luxurious boredom. Greed, with money always defining the state of affairs. Down below are the servants, arranging themselves after their masters above. It doesn't matter who they are, only who they belong to.In ordinary hands these would be enough to create a dramatic situation that employed for added tension one or the other of the whodunit tropes. We know for example there's going to be a murder at some point and the culprit is going to be one of many people we have closely followed all this time. We know furthermore that it's going to take some deductive logic on our part as we try to anticipate disaster. The game would be between the film and us, with us called to evaluate facts faster than the film can obfuscate them.Altman of course deconstructs as anticipated. It takes a long time before the event occurs, and the ensuing investigation unfolds helter skelter with clues swept aside and our police investigator always interrupted before he can even announce his name. No one is paying him or the case much mind. Officially at least the murder goes unsolved but not just for inept justice, mostly because no one really gives a damn either way.This is okay but slight and has been already milked for comedy several times. Luckily this is a more ambitious project the third layer is about film, in general and the film we are watching.There is a Hollywood producer with his star in the midst of this, both of them researching real people for what we learn is a Charlie Chan film, the most formulaic whodunit. There is a marvellous scene where our actor performs on the piano in a way that binds together the imagination of the whole house, up and down. Down below is another actor we soon learn, another maker masquerading as a servant. Perhaps now we get to note how everyone is acting some part and performs in company. We get to note a collaborative process criss-crossing the two worlds that sustains polished appearances. At the root is sex and money. Save for our murderer but even this is duplicitous because it was not one but two. One of them was much more talented and anticipated the narrative.So for all intents and purposes, this is a solid, complex work about the effort to surmise truth from a fictional wrap-around, emotional truth about life. I just can't bring myself to rate any higher because this was anticipated by the likes of Jacques Rivette and Greenaway even better.

However while his other works of the many-casted variety pushed me further and further away as they went on, this did the opposite and managed to bring me in more and more.His technique in shooting this was remarkable and absolutely perfect for the setting in which the story is staged. By having two cameras constantly moving at all times, it truly felt as though we were absorbed into the middle of this early 20th century English house, becoming a part of the gossip and the class disputes. I don't think a film of this nature could have been directed any better than how Altman did it.The thing that holds it back a lot for me is the script, which piles on way too many characters so the thing can never properly gain it's footing. The overall experience felt properly done but there were just too many people. Even at the end of the film there were times where two characters would be talking and they'd mentioned someone and I would have no idea who they were talking about. The (mostly) tremendous cast manages to make up for a lot of this, by bringing great depth without a lot of screen time, but it still feels like this would have been better suited with a longer duration. A lot of the more integral dynamics feel underdeveloped, despite the best effort of the cast.I also had a problem with how closed off the whole thing was. It couldn't (re shouldn't) have been done any other way, but the muteness kept me at a distance for the whole thing, so in some of the more emotional moments my reaction wasn't as strong as it could have been.Still, there's much, much more to admire here than there is to criticize. Altman's technique is tremendous and he was able to gather together a fine ensemble cast to play out these cold creatures. Helen Mirren is heartbreaking, Kristin Scott Thomas is always the perfect bitch, Emily Watson and Kelly Macdonald bring a human touch to the piece and Clive Owen again demonstrates that he has a lot of talent that he hasn't been putting to proper use lately.

"},{"Title":"A most subdued Agatha Christie.","Date":"18 July 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" The classic set-up for what many see as a murder mystery is shaken up and given a good thrashing in Robert Altman's Gosford Park, taking the form and context of such an episode and practically paying no attention to the actual murder. Indeed, the murder doesn't even take place until well over an hour into the film and by the end we get somewhat of an explanation as to the who and why, but all that is an aside.Typical of Altman, what he attempts to do, and succeeds brilliantly at, is show all facets of what ordinarily wouldn't be shown in the stories of Christie and other famous British murder-mystery writers. In most cases, the servants are involved one way or another yet are hardly used in the narrative until the climax. Here, Altman uses his gliding camera and overlapping dialogue to explore and find out information about all the characters, be they high-ranking or low. Here, the servants' gossip and information is just as important, if not more so, than that of the people sitting outside in the dining room with nothing to do but immerse themselves in idle chatter and sardonic wit about others less fortunate than themselves.In many ways, Altman observes this dry behavior of the typical stuffy British aristocrats and is somewhat poking fun at them. Yet, he still maintains a veil of sympathy and we still care for many of these characters, particularly the under-appreciated staff. As I said before, the murder is quite unimportant yet still provides some interesting surprises at the end. As a fan of Altman, this doesn't rank with MASH, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Nashville, or 3 Women. But, it is a breath of fresh air in the unbelievably stuffy British murder-mystery genre. "},{"Title":"The Land of Might-Have-Been","Date":"16 July 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" The bedrock of Robert Altman's Gosford Park is Jean Renoir's 1939 classic, The Rules of The Game. Both films take place at a magnificent country estate, and both delve into the lives of the upper classes and their dutiful servants. In Renoir's film, masters and servants seem to exist separately, occasionally crossing and colliding. With Altman, however, both domains intimately intertwine.Like Altman's Cookie's Fortune, which examined the baggage of race in modern America, Park's characters are trapped in a stratified class system. Both films are also preoccupied with the way in which the past maintains an iron grip on the present, affecting how we think, view and judge others.Take Morris Weissman, a character staying at Gosford Park's country estate. Weissman is condescended to by everyone in the film, not only because he is bourgeois, but because he is Jewish. One woman's desire to remain uninvolved in a court case epitomizes these attitudes, her wishes echoing the silence that permitted early 20th century anti-Semitism to flourish. When other characters mention that they don't know whether Weissman is a producer or a director, or even what the difference is, they mean, but of course don't openly state, that nothing at all matters about him. He is dismissed for his very social class and his very Jewishness.But it isn't only Jews who suffer disdain. Would you stop snivelling? One might think you were Italian! one character growls, pointing to both the universal reach of British xenophobia and the high value placed on withholding emotional expression.A hunting sequence in Renoir's film became Renoir's metaphor for warfare. Altman's similarly staged sequence suggests something else; the picking off any and all undesirables, be they dirty Jews, pompous men of wealth, the lower classes or illegitimate babies.More specifically, everyone in Altman's film struggles to tolerate someone whom they wish they could just brush aside but ultimately can't because they're pinned behind a mask of civility and exist in a kind of sprawling, symbiotic relationship with everyone else. The owner of the country mansion, a man called Sir William, for example, helps maintain the lives of various relatives and hangers-on. But his wealth is itself the product of the many barely subsistent wage-earners who work in his sweatshop factories.Gosford Park was written by Julian Fellowes, a shameless reactionary. Throughout most of his work, Fellowes puts forth the notion that, as everyone in society ultimately parasites off someone else the class system is therefore morally sound and mutually beneficial. We see traces of such thinking in Gosford Park; privileged men and woman rely on servants for sex, countesses depend on loans and allowances, aristocrats and businessmen depend on deals and alliances, wives and husbands depend on tactical marriages, artists depend on financiers and servants and butlers depend on the scraps thrown down to them by their masters.Altman, an aging hippie with a strong anti-establishment streak (he heavily re-wrote Fellowes' script), understandably focuses on such scraps. The film's servants, of course, have inferior beds, accommodation, clothes, food etc. That is to be expected. But consider one scene in which servants gather on a stairwell to listen to a musician entertaining his fellow guests upstairs. What the servants hear sounds like echoes of music rather than actual music the sonic equivalent of table scraps. Why do we have to live our lives through them? one servant says, realising that their very dreams, desires and interests oft amount to but discarded leftovers.Just as sex mixed races in Cookie's Fortune, sex mixes classes in Gosford Park. Years ago, Sir William impregnated some of the women who worked in his factory. William then discarded these babies, an act which leads, quite literally, to the past coming back to kill him, as one of the adopted babies (now grown up) infiltrates the mansion and kills Sir William.The second half of the film thus becomes a murder mystery, a whodunit akin to Agatha Cristie novels or the board-game Cluedo. But Thompson, the funny and incompetent police detective who investigates the case, can't find the killer precisely because he is locked into thinking in terms of class boxes and precisely because everyone had justifications for wanting William dead. This working-class inspector announces that he will probe upstairs only, that is to say, only those who had something to do with Sir William, as though no one downstairs conceivably might have had anything to do with him. Our detective so heavily buys into England's class structure that he halts his judgement so that he may submit to the authority of his betters. In short, he is ultimately not in charge of his investigation; those he is investigating are.This being Altman, the film is also implicitly about film-making. Three artists - Novello (musician), Denton (actor) and Weissman (a producer in the film and also Park's producer in real life) - bridge the upper and lower classes, neither belonging upstairs with the aristocrats or downstairs with the servants. Likewise, the artists must go undercover when both upstairs and downstairs, Denton pretending to be a servant and Weissman and Novello pretending to be straight and sophisticated (they're both homosexual). Weissman is also associated with Charlie Chan detective movies and The Lodger, Hitchcock's first film to utilise a roaming, curious camera. Playing out behind the film's drama is thus a meta-comment on film-making, Altman the classless artist who infiltrates, roams and reports upon both domains, but remains forever dependent on the money-men upstairs. This is director as both dutiful slave to his improvising cast and ignorant financiers, and the God behind the whole proceedings (Weissman is reflexively brainstorming the film we're watching). Fittingly, Gosford Park ends with the song The Land of Might-Have-Been, its lyrics (Somewhere there's another land, far more mercifully planned than the cruel place we know) longing for new modes of social organisation.9/10 &#x96; Masterpiece.

I told her about the first Altman movie I had seen, McCabe and Mrs. Miller. I told her about the pioneering of the rumble. You enter a room with many people talking. You cannot figure out what any one person is saying. I told her about Alman's interest in sociology, how people interact and how it relates to the world around them. She was fascinated. She thought how neat I was. It was entertaining to listen to me. I did not care about that. As I thought about what I was saying to her, I said the movie was interesting as an intellectual puzzle. It did not engage me emotionally. Though I did not say this to her, the cri de coeur of Helen Mirren, I found very startling. I did not understand her cry, until it was explained in the movie. I volunteered the most important point. I knew what the movie had to say and I would never watch it again.

In the Altman fashion the story - a standard whodunnit - becomes the armature for a whirl of vignettes. It is a marvel that one can follow the tapestry of subplots at all (and a great testament to the sound engineers, who coherently capture and mix much of the simultaneous dialogue). The tidal rush of ensemble and intimate action means that the big twist is one of a number of revelations (this is as much a wothappened as a whodunnit) and Altman thoughtfully provides a powerful melodramatic catharsis in its place.I liked the script and its committal to film immensely; so understated, so sharp and full of character. As for the characters themselves, this film seethes with the cream operating at their finest. It's so wonderful to watch. I think that Kelly McDonald, Emily Watson and Clive Owen may be the most sympathetic but only as the least anachronistic symbols as their contribution is only from the same top drawer as all the others.Two small gripes. Stephen Fry is a notable exception to the otherwise unimpeachable cast. The excuse may be that he was a late replacement for Kenneth Branagh, but with a great traditon of The Inspector's Arrival in such a film (Dial M For Murder, An Inspector Calls, any Poirot), this role is too important to have compromised on. Also, the film doesn't tell me anything much.

We are expecting to see Monsieur Poirot enter anytime during the second half of the movie. But putting this idea aside it's really a good movie with its atmosphere of an old aristocratic British mansion in the thirties of last century with all its lordships and ladyships, guests and their servants above all. The characters are all very interesting and well depicted in images and dialogues by an extremely good cast of actors and actresses. This is really the most important part of the movie and we get the impression that the murder that pops in suddenly in the middle of the movie is a mere pretext to give a plot to its story otherwise we would be left with no more that a lot of sketches and scenes regarding this or that couple of characters often with no relation between them. The murder story is indeed the weakest part of the movie and is not totally explained in clear terms being a bit confusing in terms of who did what, why and how. Nevertheless we feel ourselves compensated by watching this impeccable typically British aristocratic atmosphere of the time, the relations among its members and the servants'lives and their different behaviour in front of their masters and behind their backs including their opinions and comments about those same masters. One last word to the scenery and particularly to the mansion interior which is gorgeous and contributes to its realistic view totally adequate to the general atmosphere of the story.

Very well made film, and one of Robert Altman's best. Beyond perfecting the old murder mystery dinner party genre, it dwells on this odd microcosm of snobbery versus unaffected love, and of the deeper mystery of class and exploitation amid a specifically British idiom of keeping one's chin up and one's lip stiff. This is done with charming wit mixed equally with genuine passion, if understated then all the more effective. Altman's camera moves fluidly among the layers and nooks of this mansion, capturing the interplay of private moments and public scenes. The ensemble cast is as great as it is very large, and the challenge for any viewer is to keep track of who's who. I sense that the average person, like me, will require two viewings to appreciate the achievement of this film.

The film is set in 1932 at a shooting party in a country house, owned by a wealthy man who has made the crossover from trade to landed gentry. So in theory straight away you have a class tension. However, I found right from the start that the story itself seemed stiff and unnatural. For instance Henry would have been picked up straight away as incredibly insolent servant, and Mr Jennings would have had something to say about that.The casting was excellent, with several of Britain's best thespians being cast stunningly against type. I particularly enjoyed Richard E Grant's remarkably restrained performance, and Sir Derek Jacobi was superb too. Maggie Smith's performance was amazing, in probably the most irritating part of her long and illustrious career. I was somewhat at a loss to understand what Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) was actually doing at the party, unless it was simply an opportunity to use his music as part of the soundtrack, so it seemed a particularly awkward plot device used to introduce Weissmann into the house.This is not a bad movie, the period feels right and the performances rise above a story which does not go anywhere very quickly. I just found it a little long and somewhat clunky in parts. Enjoy it for its revealing interactions and ignore the odd awkward plot device that does not really make a great deal of sense. "}{"Title":"A cinematic portrait of post WWI British aristocracy.","Date":"24 November 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" GOSFORD PARK is definitely not a standard whodunnit movie with winding plot twists and suspenseful sequences that keep the viewer on the edge of the sofa from beginning to end. Instead, it's a brilliantly produced film that gives a fluid portrayal of British aristocracy circa the 1930s. Viewers expecting a story with a Doyle or Agatha Christie twist could be disappointed from watching this film due to the movie being a complex drama versus a mystery. However, there are two good things about this movie that really captured my attention 1)the pompous-like British aristocrats and 2) the servants that attend them.The film itself gives a generally realistic look at upper-class British life through the guise of Lord William and his guests. Secluded from society in a countryside manor, we see the goals and motivations that drive the characters. I guess what really impressed me about this group of characters was the contempt that I felt for most of them. Apart from a few of the guests, the majority portrayed in the film were conceited, vain, and just utterly selfish. I simply loathed most of the assemblage, and I think this is why I particularly admired the quality of the film. Simply, this is a film depicting the lives of these individuals and their interwoven relationships.While displaying a collection of pompous aristocrats, the film does a great job juxtaposing that same group with the servants of the manor. I particularly enjoyed the attention to detail that was used in filming the actors that performed as butlers, valets, cooks, maids, and chauffeurs. Through their eyes we see the challenges they faced, both professionally and personally. One crucial scene that I thought was powerful, although brief, was Elsie's flagrant outburst against Lord William's wife in the middle of a dinner party. The timing of that particular dialog was exact, tense, and well placed. Kudos to the director.There are probably five or six other reasons that I could use in convincing anyone to go see this film. The only negative thing I'd have to say about the story overall is that most of the plot dragged in certain places and was a bit slow-paced. I'd have to give it a 7 out of ten for that, but overall a good film to watch.

As much as I liked Ridley Scott, my preference went with David Lynch.  That's where this movie failed.  There was no mixing of narratives that Lynch is infamous for so, once again, Altman doesn't get my credit.Interestingly though, this movie showed a departure from Altman's 'MASH' train of thought.  Oh sure, it uses his old subtexts (social commentary, class difference), but that's background here.  The marked departure rests in the style of acting.  The servants are better actors than the ruling class, that's the biggest irony here.  The authority figure is a twit, but I'm that was intended.  I'll avoid critiquing on the British class system since the film speaks for itself.  It's like expecting a Brit to explain the American reaction to Vietnam.

Similarly, Altman relies on creating varied depth of space by moving around our characters and environments.The editing here is also interesting.

It was, in my opinion a little misleadingly, advertised as such - Tea At Four. Dinner At Eight. Murder At Midnight but I suppose advertising it with the tagline - Tea At Four. Dinner At Eight. Up Early for Shooting Pheasant isn't really going to bring in the crowds ...If the murder mystery part is not so important to you, however, and you want to see a wonderful period piece, with great actors and acting, a very subtle, dark humour full of character interaction this may be for you.I won't really go into the murder plot - it happens so late in the film and is practically given a back seat to the fact it has inconvenienced all the rest of the guests (and staff) that it's virtually secondary to their interactions. Actually it is really only there to hang this 'study' onto and to make a specific point at the end of the film. This is a weakness for sure and I would have preferred more emphasis on this and the resulting ending but that flaw is not a fatal one when you have a cast like this for a period drama;   Maggie Smith Room With a View, Harry Potter - faultless as the visiting Countess   Michael Gambon Singing Detective- the host, Sir William, with his hands on too many people's purse strings   Kristen Scott Thomas Four Weddings ..., English Patient - born to play a 1930s Lady and does so here with brilliance   Charles Dance Last Action Hero, Dark Blue World - the English Lord    Helen Mirren Prime Suspect, Madness of King George - the perfect housekeeper   Derek Jacobi Cadfael, Hamlet - leading the household servants   Alan Bates Love in a Cold Climate, Hamlet - a superb butler   Richard E Grant Scarlet Pimpernel- George the 1st footman, always off for a crafty smoke   Stephen Fry Peter's Friends, Wilde - the bumbling police inspector ... and many more who play their parts perfectly - the Lord who married beneath himself for money, the suspicious wife, a visiting American film producer, downstairs staff and upstairs guests having affairs both within in without of their station, the relatives requiring investments, a man with a mystery past, the military men, the men who avoided the military ... all this and Ivor Novello too. All have some secrets and almost all of them are revealed by the end of this movie.Actually Stephen Fry as the police inspector to me was the only small let down. I think his humour, though exceptionally well done, lacked the subtlety and darkness seen throughout the rest of the picture so stood out as a bit of an incongruity ... nevertheless he got away with it and I'm sure for many his will be the funniest bits of the film!It has been alleged that the film is very hard to hear with many (mostly seemingly US citizens) needing to use subtitles to catch all being said due to more than one person speaking at once and or speaking in a quiet voice plus being a difficult film to follow anyway. Yes, you do have to concentrate to keep up with the characters because of their large number, intricate machinations and (usually sordid and or selfish) intentions but I must say, as an Englishman I had no problem with making out the dialogue and various accents (even the many Scottish ones <g>). In fact I found the way voices were overlapped and heard in the background simply added not only to the realism but also the atmosphere ... no permanent rumble of traffic or piped music in the background just the low mumble of half-heard voices.Atmosphere - that's really a lot of what this film is about after all. It tries, and in my opinion succeeds, in capturing the atmosphere of the 30s (it is set in 1932) - of the slower pace of life, of the distinct class attitudes from both Upstairs and Downstairs and of the interactions of people of that age. This may be why the film seems so slow to many viewers that are used to the fast pacing and deliberate plotting of a modern Hollywood movie.In fact anyone used to the fast pacing of modern life, let alone films, *may* find it hard to slow down and appreciate the grandeur of this film and to express my thoughts below is a table of the present scoring received on the IMdB by a modern comedy (I've chosen Something About Mary as a popular comedy with the exact opposite type of humour) and Gosford Park. Obviously this is a coarse tool but it does seem to make its point...Something About Mary 18-29yrs 7.4, 30-44 7.0, 45+ 6.6, Male 7.3, Female 6.8Gosford Park	18-29yrs 7.4, 3-44 7.8, 45+ 8.0, Male 7.5, Female 8.0Quite noticeably as the audience gets older the score rises for Gosford Park and falls for Something About Mary. At my 36 years I must admit I enjoyed much more the delicate and restrained humour of the former to the in your face and (to me) often juvenile humour of Something About Mary.To support this age bias; for the Director's Chair showing in my local cinema I seemed to be one of the youngest in the packed theatre ... what you read into this is up to you!To support the male/female split It makes a change from the usual blood and violence films you take me to was the comment as we approached the cinema from my fianc√©e ... yes it was her choice, but I for one am really glad that she made that choice!Of course all the above just shows a trend and certainly doesn't mean you'll like or dislike it just because you fall into one specific bracket or another but maybe it'll help you to decide if this is your 'kind of movie'; I hope so.In summary the plot and ending lacked direction but this clever, subtle period piece needed neither to make it worth watching if you can keep down to the pace ...7/10  "},{"Title":"ambitious film that falls a little short of the mark","Date":"11 August 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  It's Britain between the wars, and a large group of aristocrats--and their servants--are gathering for a weekend shooting party at a magnificent country estate.

The first one are the owners of the house and the guests of a shooting party organised in Gosford Park. The lower class is represented by maids, cooks and pages. This clear split has reminded me a 1970th British TV-series. Two actions in parallel are described and one character, a false page, builds up a bridge between the two classes. He is in reality an actor who wants to learn about that world.   Nothing is missed, everything is there with a precise and maniacal description. Even a murder gives the leit motiv and the thrilling effect to dig out the personality of the characters. Robert Altman, the excellent director, has never disappointed but films as this one improve certainly his already famous career.Rating 7/10   "},{"Title":"A winner for Robert Altman","Date":"25 July 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Depending on whom you ask, legendary director Robert Altman is either a fool or a genius.  His fifty year career includes prominence in the early days of TV with his direction of dozens of hit series such as `Alfred Hitchcock Presents', `Maverick', and `Bonanza'.   His filmmaking credits include `M.A.S.H.' and `The Player', both critically acclaimed.  His mercurial style of filmmaking is probably a rebellion from the highly structured approach imposed upon him by early TV.  The direction of his recent films can only be described as chaotic, with a cacophony of actors speaking over one another, and moving hither and yon as the camera sweeps from one side of the room to the other attempting to home in on the dialogue of particular characters.  Altman himself admits that he doesn't even read the script and really isn't concerned with what the actors say, as long as things sound right to him when they come out of their mouths.  He encourages ad-libbing and the more disordered the scene, the better he generally likes it.  Often, this produces utter disasters, like `Dr. T and the Women' and `Gun'.  Sometimes it produces a gem like `Gosford Park'.As a murder mystery, Gosford Park is not all that special.  It is fairly predictable with obvious hints dropped at every turn as to who did it and why.  As is the case in most of Altman's recent films, it is difficult to make out a lot of the dialogue with the din on the soundstage of everyone talking at once.  However, what makes this film unique is the treatment of the human dynamic between the aristocracy and the servants.  While lampooning the wealthy by contrasting their behavior with the simple wisdom of commoners is nothing new, never has it been done with such depth and nuance.  Altman's flowing direction of simultaneous events is probably the only way this could have been accomplished so effectively.The all-star ensemble cast is superlative.  Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Jeremy Northam all give fabulous performances upstairs, and Kelly Macdonald, Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Emily Watson and Alan Bates are marvelous downstairs.  For film lovers who enjoy good acting, this film is paradise.Genius or fool?  Who knows, maybe both.  However for Robert Altman, this film is clearly a winner.  I rated it 9/10.

Boring, rubbish, dull, this film is most certainly not. I have heard bitching about how hard it is to follow what is going on, that the storyline is rubbish, the dialog is rubbish, the acting is rubbish. Was I watching the same film? Apparently not!This film is slow I will happily admit, but whats the point of having a remotely speedy movie when all Altman is trying (and in my opinion succeeding) to do is to convey the atmosphere at the time. Do you ever wonder why old people moan about every one being in a hurry in this day and age? Its because compared to there time it is. As for the viewer not being able to follow whos who throughout the film. It doesnt matter, and for me is subtly the point. The majority of the people are out for themselves and dont mind who they screw over to get what they want, but at the same time hypocritically look down on everyone else. The only characters who you really start to follow and recognise are those who have, well character, and in this case this tends to be the servants due to the fact that they dont spend all their time doing one thing, looking out for themselves. When watching this movie you have to keep in mind that it is less about murder and more about the 1930's and the people in it. The murder only highlights what we already know, that no-ones cares about the deceased but only what it means for them, and the fact that the dead man was hated by so many simply highlights that he angered many by again,looking out for himself. Oh and to the person calling themselves Kanerazor. If you think that Memento (admittedly screwed over at the Oscars along with Tennenbaums) was wittier than this then you must have either been asleep or deaf and blind as Steven Fry's character is one of the most ineptly funny characters I have seen for a long time!

This is not a normal murder mystery. In fact, its not even about the murder. Its about the characters! If you are used to normal popcorn flicks and know nothing nor care about huge ensemble pieces, directing, or characterization you probably will not appreciate this film for its powers. Save your money. It will probably bore you.  Robert Altman introduces a wide range of aristocrats and their servants and spends three-fourth of his film letting them show you their various personalities through their interactions with each other. And he's devilishly subtle about it leaving dialogue and visuals low-key when they should be. People who have already seen this film should make a special note to remember how each single character was practically introduced in some shape or form. There is almost not a person staying at Gosford Park that does not get their word in and does not add to the intrigue of the plot. The storyline is set with people who have motives to kill and subtle hints are given to the reasonings of the killer...but the killer remains to be known until the end and by then you don't mind the killer or his/her reasonings.   This is perhaps the best casted ensemble piece I have ever seen. Every person is their character. Every person is believable. Helen Mirren's performance is a near flawless example of an affective quiet role. Maggie Smith was perfectly casted as the snippy Aunt Constance. Kristen Scott Thomas plays the uber-bitch lady of the house to the t. The list goes on... I almost felt that AMPAS could have filled the Best Supporting Actress category with women from this film and been perfectly justified.  This is a new Altman classic that I hope is not ignored for years to come. A nine of ten in my eyes.

We are in the English countryside, it is the year 1932, and guests are invited to join a hunting party. A very English pastime, at which the host is completely inept, half the guest are no better than him and the rest finds it either boring or distasteful. For the first two hours, thus, we are treated to the most intriguing social study, since we are given the gift of multiple characters of astonishing substance (considering that other directors cannot even develop their leads beyond the one-dimensional) and a double view from both the gentry upstairs, and (mostly, and more insightfully) the servants, downstairs. And just when we are content to enjoy no more than said social study, the simmering tensions quite unexpectedly do come to a head. It is then that we finally get the murder we remember from the trailer, at which point the film gains astonishing momentum. Not only do we learn how mid-20th Century rural Police work (or not), but all remaining story threads are resolved to perfection. This includes hints to stories that are just about to begin - which proves that the best kind of movie does not end with the credits, but continues in the minds of the audience.

It isn't Hollywood glitz but its delightful ensemble acting and direction.The cast includes Alan Bates, Helen Mirren, Stephen Fry, Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, Michael Gambon, Richard E. Grant, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Northern, and Kristen Scott Thomas. There are a couple of American ring ins too, Bob Balaban and Ryan Phillippe to round out a classic English cast.Director Robert Altman (Mash, The Player, Nashville, McCabe and Mrs Miller, Short Cuts, Kansas City and Pret a Porter, et al.), the master of large stellar casts, has conceived with Bob Balaban a masterful Agatha Christie who done it which at the same time profoundly satirises, with a good dose of gentle humour,  class snobbery in 1930's English county houses.The head of the household Sir William (Michael Gambon) has with his wife Lady Syliva invited guests to their country mansion for a shooting party. Constance (Maggie Smith) and Anthony (Tom Hollander) are desperate to court favour with the nasty Sir William because without his support they are destined for relative poverty.Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban) a brash American in England researching his next Charlie Chan film, has brought with him his valet Henry (Ryan Phillippe). Henry isn't averse to seducing anyone if it suits him. Downstairs we meet Helen Mirren as the head housekeeper Mrs Wilson and the head cook Mrs Croft played by Eileen Atkins. Then there's the wonderfully manipulative footman George (Richard E. Grant). Gosford Park mixes and matches this lot, and many more, with delightful dexterity.Inevitably a murder occurs. It has to! There's a missing knife and lingering views of poison bottles. Then a wonderfully inept policeman arrives (Stephen Fry) who's becomes yet another clever comment on just how silly and vain some of us humans become in the face of a class ridden and driven community like the one that exists in Gosford Park.Gosford Park isn't just a who dunnit by any stretch.

Altman has taken particular care to detail, accurately recreating a country house party of the 1930's.  However, what the director is obviously much more interested in is the inner workings of the house, how the relationships between the characters differ between appearance and reality.  The film is slightly deceiving in advertising itself as a murder mystery, as the main theme of the film is not murder or detective work, yet the different between the social classes, the 'upstairs' and the 'downstairs' party.  The films closing credits epitomise this by dividing the cast list into two, in the same way the characters would have been divided in their contemporary period.  The extent of Altman's genius is shown in his ability to interweave so many different storylines and relationships between the characters.  He has assembled an eclectic list of characters, each with their own quirks and personal interests, and then throws them 'Big Brother style' into a house, observing how they interact like a scientist testing rats.  The representation of the characters is also extremely clever, as the film doesn't generalise the upper classes in a derogatory role whilst presenting the lower classes in a more general light.  Instead, each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, making themselves completely individual to the rest of the house.This, however, is one of the films pitfalls as by the end of the film, the audience may not have figured out every character and may have made their own conclusions, which do not concur with the directors intention.  However, this remains to be a wholly fascinating study of class differences, and character relationships, in the 1930's.

Very Worthwhile.","Date":"13 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Gosford Park is a most unusual and complex film. Its all about the getting there, and then when it does get there the gotten only serves to compliment the getting. Yes, there is a        mystery, and yes it is solved, but this only further complicates the characters and their relationships to one another. The revelation of the mystery only affords a greater mystery. So, in all actuality, the ending is only the place where the movie ends and the credits begin. How Gosford Park is all this and still manages to be satisfying is, perhaps, the greatest mystery of all.The plot of Gosford Park is entirely to complex to be neatly tidied up here, besides anything less than a full script would be superficial. I will say, however, that it concerns a massive group of impossibly rich characters, invited to a          party circa November 1932. Nearly all of these are restricted to the upstairs (aristocrats) and downstairs (servants). The first half of the film would seem to show the differences between these, but then, ironically, someone is       ed and the film takes the opposite turn. Suddenly, each of these people are all just people, and the only thing dividing them is a set of stairs and musty ideals. Each group is, after all, made up of individuals put in their place solely by chance. In the end everyone has their own specific problems and concerns, that may or may not relate to their class, and are often either paralleled or mingled with the opposite class.Do these themes resolve the movie? Well, yes and no. In the end the        is irrelevant, and could have been substituted by any similar scandal or tragedy. It is the characters that matter. We never really find out just who everyone is, but that, the mystery left unsolved, may be the point of the movie. Gosford Park is at first all about surfaces, every character begins a caricature. However, gradually we realize that there is something never completely disclosed going on beneath the surface. Sure there are little revelations throughout, but all they really tell us is that each character is more than meets the eye. In an exact reversal of typical narrative, the characters start out simple and accessible, but end complex and mysterious. So their plights are never really resolved, they may still come away a little bit wiser for their visit.All of this is made rich by cunning direction, lush photography, and impossibly wonderful performances. That director Robert Altman (M*A*S*H, Nashville) manages to drag a brilliant performance out every every member of his whopping 23-character cast is, well, like I said... impossible. But then again Altman really doesn't seem to give a damn. He is one of the most talented directors of our age, and he puts that talent to good use here. He knows the tricks of his trade very well. He can make any character an         , a suspect, and all with the angle of his camera. And how he handles that cast...!Speaking of which, it would take entirely to much text to detail the performances of each main character, as there are so many of them. However, there are two female performances that stand out, and seem to be garnering special attention. Maggie Smith is a show-stealer. She is so wonderfully bitchy and disdainful in her role, really giddy to behold. She manages to teeter perfectly between being a part of her class, and absolutely contemptuous of it. Then, in the opposite light is Helen Mirren. A servant, her performance is composed of subtle glances which tell us just enough of her bitterness, cynicism, and ultimate love, without completely revealing her. She is ultimately very sad, and she suppresses and reveals that sadness in just the right way. Altman openly claimed his film to be greatly influenced by the classic French film, La Regle Du Jeu, a very similar study of social classes. Does this detract from the film's originality? Not really. Upstairs-Downstairs movies are really a genre all their own. Antiwar films, interracial love stories, teen angst dramas and other specific types of movies all may express very similar themes, but they can also be very unique. Gosford Park expresses the universal ideas of La Regle, but in a different manner. It lifts the themes and settings of the earlier film, and populates them with many different characters, and situations. The tone is different as well...In Gosford Park Altman takes a very sly, farcical approach to his material. When watching it I got the feeling that he was like a kid throwing rocks into a busy anthill. His        is his greatest rock, and one the ants spend a great deal of time figuring out how to approach. Should they swarm all over it, stand aside and laugh scornfully, hide away, or blame each other? Altman's ants all take a different approach. In the end there's just this rock sitting in the anthill, and they all leave. Besides, if anyone committed the        it was Altman himself.

He plays on all the cliches of the genre the murdered aristocrat, the suspect servants & aristocrats, a beautiful old English country house to make it appear that this is just another genre film.  This couldn't be farther fr. the truth.  Altman has composed a sly, corrosive commentary on the English class system in which he completely turns the genre on its head.  The aristocrats are totally secondary characters in this film.  The entire film is carried by the servants.  They are the main characters, they drive the plot & completely dominate the denouement.

Be very careful in noting the plot developments because you may not notice the subtle references which reveal the killer at the end.  If you don't follow the action closely, the solving of the murder might not even be apparent to you.Altman wants to tell us that the wealthy classes only think they're important.

The presence of Emily Watson was also a major factor ('Breaking The Waves' -for me, one of the saddest, most beautiful and most brilliant pieces of cinema ever).I'd heard this was maybe a little above the usual English country house period drama fodder. Indeed, the start was impressively done, as you get sucked into the world as it was in the 1930's and the way the extended family suckle at the fat belly of Sir William McCordle (played by Michael Gambon). Upon his death, it's rather stultifying to witness the calmness, almost warm wave of apathy that seems to infuse most of the gathering. Unfortunately, this lack of emotion from the characters infected me as well.It's sometimes difficult with such a large cast simply remembering who is who and how they interrelate with each other. To overcome this, it helps if there is enough depth to encourage repeat viewings. Unfortunately, it takes so long for anything beyond character development and scene setting to occur, that repeat viewings are (for me anyway) unlikely. The volume of characters and their equality in terms of importance unfortunately renders the viewer's relationship with even the most interesting ones - such as Robert Parks (Clive Owen) and Mrs Wilson, The Housekeeper (Helen Mirren) - not necessarily intimate enough to generate any real feeling when their denouement comes.The absolute nadir of the movie is the atrocious Inspector Thompson (portrayed by Stephen Fry), such a ridiculous unbelievable caricature of an incompetent 1930's Detective that by his appearance he sucks out all seriousness and believability from the final third of the story. Handling unfingerprinted decanters? Ignoring clues found by enterprising Constables? You betcha. Thankfully the good points - the performances of Emily Watson, Maggie Smith and Richard E Grant, the articulation of the class differences and arrogance of the upper-classes - balance this somewhat.

Perhaps he thought the anthropology of it all was interesting or just wanted to try out the genre. Anyway, he has produced a very English film about as far away from `Mash' or `Nashville' as you could get, although not terribly far removed from `Cookie's Fortune.' He has used a galaxy of English acting talent, (sometimes rather under-utilising it &#150; Charles Dance is almost completely wasted) to produce a rambling, crowded and moderately scintillating 1930s country house murder mystery. The plot itself is not too difficult to work out (Altman is no Agatha Christie) but it is a little difficult at times to follow all the by-play and even remember who everybody is &#150; there are at least 30 significant speaking roles. The original `Upstairs Downstairs' TV series (represented here by its co-creator, Eileen Atkins, in an acting role as Mrs Croft the Cook) took a fairly sanguine view of the master-domestic servant relationship. Altman is under no such illusions and his servants , both above and below stairs, are a thoroughly exploited lot, though many seem happy enough in their station. The head of the household, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon, in a fairly restrained performance) is not aristocracy, but a self-made millionaire who has married up - to the very elegant and younger Lady Sylvia (Kristen Scott-Thomas). He is a nasty sh*t and she is about as faithful as a tomcat, so there's plenty of scope for trouble. A late autumn shooting weekend for friends and family brings matters to a head, though it is not Lady Sylvia's insatiable sexual appetite that provides the trigger. There are lots of personal stories, if not too many real suspects; the chief police investigator (a sublimely incompetent Stephen Fry) gets nowhere, and the mystery is solved for us by a young lady's maid, just in case we couldn't work it out ourselves.The real interest here, as is often the case with Altman, is the characters and their social situation. In this society the nuances of social distinction are very fine indeed and breaches of the rules are sternly dealt with. Elsie the head housemaid (Emilie Watson) is bonking Sir William, a fact Lady Sylvia is aware of and which she tolerates. When, however, Elsie intervenes in defence of Sir William in an argument at the dinner table between Sir William and Lady Sylvia, a total breach of decorum for a servant, she is instantly dismissed. .The household is run with great efficiency by Mrs Wilson, the housekeeper, (Helen Mirren) though Jennings the butler (an addled Alan Bates) is nominally in charge, and despite the murder the breakfast trays continue. There is a parallel between this movie and James Cameron's `Titanic', a fascination with how the great obsolete machine, in this case a large country house, worked.The movie is rather overstuffed with characters, and I wondered whether the Ivor Novello character was really necessary. Jeremy Northam does a very good portrayal of the great English (actually Welsh) silent film matinee idol (who also composed `Keep the Home Fires Burning' and various other crowd-pleasers) and does justice to several Novello songs. His participation in this story is entirely fictional and doesn't add much to it, though the different reaction of the servants and their masters to his crooning at the drawing room piano is interesting. I suppose his friend Morris Weissman, the putative  producer of Charlie Chan movies, provided a good opportunity to send up American crassness and self-importance with his endless trans-Atlantic phone calls, but it's not terribly original stuff. Ryan Phillippe is good as his `valet' &#150; a rotten little self-seeker from Central Casting with the Fox studio label still on his striped trousers which he drops whenever he gets a chance. The acting honours go to Maggie Smith as William's sister Constance, Queen of the put-down, who is nevertheless convinced she doesn't have a snobbish bone in her body. She has many of the best lines and uses them to deadly effect.It's an amazing piece from a 76 year old, but I noticed the audience at the preview I attended was pretty ancient (ie even older than me)., I guess Altman will expire about the same time his fans do, but he seems to have a picture or two in him yet.

I haven't heard any critics or any of the moviegoing public mention Rules, nor do I see the creative team from Rules listed among the writers of Gosford Park.  It's 90% Rules and 10% Clue.This film has, without a doubt, the longest stream of scenes before the first plot point is reached than any I've ever seen.

It's impossible for me to give a damn about any of these characters (except the cute girl from Trainspotting), and therefore the whole story under these circumstances.  It's just a mess, plain and simple.As for Rules of the Game, many consider it among the all time greats ever made, so if you liked Gosford Park, you should certainly give it a look.  It also takes place in a large mansion in a secluded place where a group of pretentions upper class European jerks bring their servants along for a weekend of pretention and game hunting.  Painful truths are revealed, murder takes place, and equal time is spent from the perspectives of both the upper and lower classes.As for me, I lump both films into my The Big Chill class of films.  Everyone, even the most ardent film fan, has a type of film they can't stand, and this is mine, so take my thoughts with a grain of salt.  But, man.  If I have to sit through one more film where a group of pretentious ******* get together for a weekend in a large, secluded place so they can make painful but necessary revelations or find out long lost truths before they return to their empty lives, I'm going to blow my brians out.

Dinner at eight. Murder at midnight) would lead you to believe that this was going to be a standard whodunnit story, you would be some way off the mark.  It is rather a richly layered drama which requires the audience to keep up at a fairly quick pace with everything that is going on within it.The vast majority of characters enjoy plenty of screentime and those actors on show who do not appear as often make the most of what time they have (see Richard E Grant's mischievous manservant and Stephen Fry's inept Inspector). A few of the standout performances come from Maggie Smith, Kelly McDonald, Helen Mirren.In fact there are so many characters to discover in this movie that it can, at times, become a little confusing, but that would be missing the point because this is an ensemble piece.  A who's who of British cinema is on display here (no small achievement) - Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi, Kirsten Scott Thomas, Alan Bates, Emily Watson, Clive Owen, Richard E Grant, Stephen Fry, Jeremy Northam, Charles Dance to name but a few.On the downside the irritating and over-rated Ryan Philippe makes an unwelcome appearance in the film although, on the other hand, perhaps this is an example of perfect casting because his character is not intended to be likeable or convincing.Whilst there may be those who feel that the film takes its time starting, drags in places, is overlong and that not enough really happens, they will all generally have to gone to see the wrong movie. Simply put this is one of those rare gems of moviemaking which firmly, and unashamedly, focuses on the characters and allows the plot to flow from them as opposed to the reverse. Despite the many serious and complex elements of the movie though humour is never far away and there were some genuinely funny moments in this movie - made all the more amusing by the tragi-drama of the film.Gosford Park does require thought and patience from the viewer but it is a great movie.  Fans and non-fans of Robert Altman alike will not be disappointed by this movie because he delivers one of the best films of the year and is, without doubt, worthy of many of the oscar nominations it has received.

Indeed the acting throughout was superb, but after 20 minutes I was thoroughly dazed sorting out the characters, and asking myself When are they going to get on with the story? Well, the simple answer is...there isn't much of a story.  Anyone believing it is going to be a murder thriller will be sadly disappointed.  With an extremely large cast the film becomes confusing with so many fleeting glances of characters popping in and out of rooms, peering around endless corridors and doorways, snippets of conversational gossip....it feels very much as if you were there with all the noisy background of chatter emanating from people who are living very empty lives.  Slowly you begin to put the pieces together and you comprehend what is going on.  Despite a murder near midnight, nobody seems terribly upset as they adjust to a police investigation which in itself seems very casual.  You get the feeling in the end that it won't be long before another outdoor shooting party will be arranged when the company can get together again and have a nice gossip and the servants below can spy on the goings-on upstairs.

I dont go to watch a cast, I go to see a story told. True, the better the cast, the better the telling, in theory. But when the story is so flimsy, cliche ridden and bereft of originality, then the ensemble becomes just another bunch of misdirected actors. And this ensemble can't disguise the fact that Gosford Park is built on a weak, confusing, and frequently dreary script. It seems that Altman saw Howards End, thought I can do that, and then proceeded to prove he couldn't. There is a difference between style and craft. To be fair, the movie is beautifully crafted. But it is devoid of passion, plot and personalities.  Instead, it is crammed with dead-ends, scenes with no purpose or meaning, stereotyped British aristocracy and their stereotyped lackeys in a plot that meanders, stumbles and drifts to a silly crime with an obvious perpetrator.  The bumbling policemen, the besmirched maid, the alcoholic butler and the prim dowager all make an appearance. Sure, the metaphoric statement is recognisable, but given the multitude of similar movies, television shows and plays that all used the same vehicle for their social commentary, its hard to miss. If the identical movie was made by an unknown director, with an unknown cast, it would be declared a turkey. Dont let big names fool ya!!! This thing will put you to sleep better than Temazapam.

Maybe it's because he's an American (as am I), but I don't think I've ever seen a more enjoyable or lucid exposition of the British class system. The look of the film is faded and decaying, mirroring the eroding class system it portrays. Juxtaposed to the muted colors are vibrant performances of the ensemble cast.

Make sure you see this movie in a movie house with a good sound system!As a murder mystery, Altman is sometimes heavy-handed with clues. Unlike some, I found the English Twit inspector (with his long-suffering competent assistant) funny, and at the same time, a believable product of a world where the class system and meritocracy did not see eye to eye.This is Altman's best film in many years, and one of his best ever.

Add to that a collection of some of the finest actors, every one of them radiating brilliant performances, and the actual murder whodunnit is of almost secondary interest to the detailed goings on of everyday life amongst the gentry and servants. Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Stephen Fry, Kelly McDonald, Maggie Smith. The list goes on - you couldn't squeeze much more top notch talent into a single movie.

Attempt was to combine Shooting Party with an Upstairs, Downstairs situation, plus a few others (Cold Comfort Farm, Agatha Christie's you-name-it) thrown in for self-parody's sake. The intent I assume was contrast, but the result is a grayish blur -- visually as well as figuratively. Same problem I had with Black Hawk Down (or Watership Down, with its cast of lookalike British bunnies for that matter) so many characters I couldn't keep track. G Park is a more quality piece of writing than I make it sound, but the intent was apparently to have conflict develop gradually until it busts loose near end, and by then I don't care much -- shortening the running time 15 or 20 minutes would have kept me a little more interested, and not at the expense of anything important. Characters are consistently disagreeable anyway. Sameness is not a preferred goal when the project is potentially hackneyed from its very conception, no matter how loudly the credit for this idea is touted by Messrs Altman and Balaban. That sameness is not just between this film and the ones it's imitating, but within the film's own structure from beginning to end.I did not absolutely hate Gosford Park. It may in fact grow on people after a second viewing, when it hits Bravo on basic cable or when the video can be rented for a few bucks, and one's investment in the expectation involved in going to the movies is no longer a factor.

Was I happy after it? Well, yes I was.The story is essentially simple - a group of upper class lords and ladies attending a gathering in a British manor, in the 1930s, along with their valets and hand-maidens. Throw them all together and mix and see what happens (a murder). One of the film's greatest strengths, and weaknesses, is the huge cast. It's a strength in that the acting - from all - is spot on and there will be someone for everyone. It's a weakness in that it's initially confusing trying to place who everyone is. Even when you do get to grasp with most of the characters, the little touches that are invested in each means that there's never enough time to focus on your favourite. For myself this was easily the wonderfully caustic Countess of Trentham, for which Maggie Smith gained a deserved Oscar nod. But she's not the only one on top form - Richard E.Grant excel's as the cynical footman, Helen Mirren is in fine (and Oscar nominated) form as the cold head of the household, and Kelly McDonald (playing Trentham's maid) shines as her character tries desperately to cope in the huge bustling labyrinth of the house.The script mostly sparkles. It relies on the interplay of characters - much in the manner of Altman's Short Cuts - and the social divisions. Classic upstairs/downstairs scenario, as has been mentioned elsewhere. There's some great lines from Trentham's witty observations, to Freddie Nisbett's it's nobody comment when he sees one of the servants. The murder is, in many ways, irrelevant since it's very obvious who will be murdered. Even the murderer isn't all that surprising - but since this movie is about characters, it doesn't matter. The movie looks well, and particular mention must go to the actual design of the house itself, where the layout is perfectly designed to suit the bustle of the characters without ever seeming too empty, or too cramped (except when the occasion demands it). The films look is somewhat dull, in terms of lighting, but Altman does show enough skill that he's able to firmly rove between characters without the camera ever seeming to interfere, or be the central focus of the action - we're left, as we're meant to be, as an observer to the events and lives. I'm not sure if I would give this the Best Picture award, as I feel there are stronger contenders. Similarly Altman isn't as strong directing here as he has been previously, and there's better work produced by other directors this year. Nevertheless the script is excellent, the acting well above par, and the movie is a lovely escape from the brain-dead action movies we're subjected to now-days. A well deserved 7.8/10.

A weekend party is thrown, someone is murdered, and a detective shows up to try to solve the mystery. While the movie occasionally seems to drag, it's well worth it's two and a half hour length. It give us, unlike other murder mysteries, time to really get to know the victim. As to the cast, all are terrific. All the actors and actresses fit their roles to the letter (even Phillipe, which surprised me). Some standouts are Helen Mirren as one of the lead servants, and Kristen Scott-Thomas as the lady of the house. I always enjoy Charles Dance, and it was nice to see him in the credits. I found myself dubbing his character, Colonel Mustard! Clive Owen puts plenty of Charm into his servant role, and I wouldn't be shocked to see him take over the role of James Bond when Brosnan decides to opt out. And it was no surprise to me that Maggie Smith scored an oscar nomination. She steals the show as one of the socialites. Also providing a lot of comic relief was Stephen Fry's Inspector Tom...... But my favorite actor, and character, in the movie was Richard E. Grant's George. he had several funny moments. Plus, he got to spill coffee in Ryan Phillipe's lap.

And these moments do not make up a compact 30 minute segment.  No, they are a few moments here and there (only about 5 of which last for more than a minute) spread out throughout the entire film.  The remaining 2 hours and 10 minutes are waste, where we get snippets of several characters who are slightly interacting together, developing aborted plots and character semi-portraits.  About a third of these characters are speaking in soft voices with thick common accents and low vocalization, making their snippets of dialogue even more pointless to the untrained ear.  They might as well have included static to replace those moments, because there's nothing interesting to look at either (regardless of the costume and set design Oscar nominations, which are merely for the ability to recreate the look of an English mansion falling into decadence in the 1930s, not because any of it is eye candy; filler nominations, if you ask me).Despite the crowding of characters and Altman's alleged legendary abilities to weave many stories and characters together and explore them fully, there's only about 6 to 8 characters that we really get to know about (and for half of those, most of their information is revealed in the last-minute exposition at the conclusion of the film).  And unfortunately, only three characters are regularly entertaining a rich socialite grouch (played by Maggie Smith), a nobleman who dreams of being an entertainer yet is met with flops, and a police inspector's smarter assistant.  Unfortunately, the latter two are left to a side.  Thus, it's up to Maggie Smith and her character (Constance) to carry the movie for us.  After a while, you share her grouchiness towards the fellow socialites.  Smith's nomination is deserved, although it is odd that she's in the supporting actress category, when her name is top billed in the credits, not to mention the movie opens and closes with her.  I guess the lead actress is considered to be Emily Watson, who plays Constance's servant, Elsie, a character who serves as a vehicle to connect the other many characters, although Elsie's emotional gamut is limited, and some of her decisions are inexplicable.  Helen Mirren is also top billed, although she's in the background during the entire picture, except for the last 10 minutes, when at last she gets a chance to show off her marvelous acting talents and tells us something about her character.Supposedly, Gosford Park is a murder mystery spoof.  Actually, that plot line does not develop until 1 hour and 20 minutes into the film.  In other words, there's practically an entire standard movie before the advertised plot develops.  The rest is a look at the different interaction between social groups in old Britain.  If you've seen ANY other movie about the British elite and their servants, then you've seen and know everything this movie has to offer on that topic.  And it isn't an entertaining take on the division (don't expect any humorous Tom Jones-like direction here).  The screenplay offers some amusing lines here and there, but most of it is bickering, or random lines spouted by obnoxious characters, like Bob Balaban's gay filmmaker of Charlie Chan flicks - geez, can't Altman make a movie without lamely attacking Hollywood's elite?  The Player is 10 years old, and wasn't that great to start with.  To round out Gosford's problems, Robert Altman directs this in a limp, standard, hardly caring manner, with even some amateurish moments (e.g. overly dramatic music bursts out when a servant is informed that her hard work of the previous night was meaningless).  He does have the occasional interesting shot, but those are quite few.  His Oscar nomination just shows the influence of Hollywood politics on these awards (let's give him an Oscar before he kicks the bucket - Altman is 77 years old and Oscarless to this date).  Heck, the only deserving nominations are for the actresses.  It's troublesome that the wittiest writing of the movie is featured in the its poster, yet it has a best original screenplay nod.The best thing I can say is hey, at least it isn't H.E.A.L.T.H.!

I did think figuring out the connections between the characters was difficult - this was not necessarily a bad thing, indeed it adds to the realism - people do not explain who they are related to and who they are having affairs with in real life. I did think the cursory way the murder was treated was irritating as well. Then I had a bit of a think about it... Portents of death and doom are all over this movie. They go shooting for birds, the bloody mary smashes to the floor leaving red stains all over the floor, the upstairs characters discuss the loss of the empire and the devastating effects of the war whilst the downstairs lot mull over orphanages, factory work and dead babies. In this atmosphere, what is one more dead body? Going to watch this film two days after Princess Margaret's death gave it an extra resonance in a way. The Royal Family is so moribund and irrelevant, her death is hardly a surprise it feels like she (or at least what she represents) has been dead for years already. The film gestures towards the new fluidity in social relations and affluence that will come, but only after the devastation of World War 2. Pain and death is a necessary precursor to a more hopeful future, represented by the Americans and the two maids, Mary and Elsie (played brilliantly by Emily Watson and Kelly McDonald  - last seen advertising deodorant!)It is Mary, the young naive girl who solves the mystery where male bombast and confidence fails. It is the American, Morris, representative of glamour, who rescues Elsie and takes her to a new life. America is forward looking, fluid, modern, where Britain is hidebound and ridiculous. The maid wakes the Ryan Philippe character. 'Can't you tell I'm not like those a***holes?' he asks. 'You can't play for both teams' she replies. The point is now you can, through films and acting and pretence. You can be anyone you like in the dream factory of Hollywood. Is it going to far to say this film is predicting the importance of America and its film culture in post war Europe? Maybe. But did you notice the little plot detail - the American is a vegetarian. I'm a meat eater myself, but what more symbolism could there be of someone dedicated to life over death, humanity over selfishness?

But it's by no means dull; I laughed a lot.The characters are good. It can be a little hard to keep everyone straight at first (make sure you can hear it well; I saw it in a theater with a whacked out sound system and it was very frustrating). But once you settle into in, the characters are very rewarding. The actors all did a good job. Lots of fresh faces and many known ones.Kelly Macdonald, as Mary the maid we spent so much time with, was very sweet without being saccharine. And, hello Clive Owen as Parks the valet; he rocked. He was friendly, handsome, wise, and he played barely-reigned-in without being manic.It was interesting (although frustrating) to see the excellent Jeremy Northam in a smaller roll. I think this was the first time I've ever liked Derek Jacobi in a movie. Helen Mirren as the housekeeper was a steady hand. Richard E.

A fantastic cast; a great director; a wonderful period setting; 'upstairs downstairs' with a richer cast.. So what happened? I admit I am a fan of crime fiction, and I did not go along just to watch a whodunnit, but I did feel that, apart from the well-drawn class distinctions clearly on show, we might have made just a little bit more of the fact that the poor host got murdered? Was this all part of a grand joke that I obviously failed to get? Is it an in-joke that chaps getting murdered in a country house is so commonplace that the action will just skirt round the minor point of a dead body? I suppose that will explain why the hapless Stephen Fry struggles to get his name out. Thankfully, due to the crime's low profile, we don't see too much of Mr Fry. All in all, inspite of the undeniable great acting, especially Kelly Macdonald and Maggie Smith, I was disappointed. I mean, why bother with a murder if you're not going to 'delve' a bit, rather than just tell us 'Oh, by the way, sowinso did it, with the thingy, because of whathisname.' Yes, the main point WAS the class thing, but it shouldn't have stopped us having a good old mystery to get our teeth into, whilst we marvel at Maggie not bothering to wear the shirt which Kelly has stayed up half the night to wash and dry for her! Yes, I did yawn. I tried to suppress it, mind you, but that was only because I didn't want to yawn in the presence of my superiors. Oh, alright then. I admit it. I yawned twice. Good, but overrated.

English upstairs and downstairs storyline with reasonable murder and intrigue. It's rather a fun romp, murder or no murder, under Robert Altman's direction. Reminds me how Woody Allen has been optimizing ensemble casts in his annual outings. Hannah and her sisters 1986 was superb; Manhattan Murder Mystery 1993 could be a good parallel here. Just watching the ensemble cast enjoying themselves in an Altman or Allen film is sporting enough. With Altman films, mischief and misbehaving are regular ingredients. While Allen has his New Yorker condiments sprinkled throughout matching his Woody sensibilities.Gosford Park has practically an all British cast other than young Ryan Phillippe, and Bob Balaban (whose shared idea with Altman became the literal script) as the Americans in the midst. It's stylistic in set and costume, language and manners. A full 137 mins. of watching the interactions between the stellar cast  upstairs with Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Camilla Rutherford (the McCordle), Maggie Smith (the Countess), Charles Dance and Geraldine Somerville (the Stockbridge), James Wilby and Claudie Blakly (the Nesbitt), Jeremy Northam, Bob Balaban and others, including inspector Stephen Fry. The downstairs, more colorful in tone, is led by Alan Bates and Helen Mirren, with Eileen Atkins, Derek Jacobi, Richard E. Grant, Emily Watson, Sophie Thompson, guest attendants Clive Owen, Kelly MacDonald, and the 'out of place' Phillippe. Call it a farce, mockery, or mere play (in every sense of the word) - if you dislike not the English ways, you'd enjoy this fine. If you're looking for deep meaning, exciting drama, a tear-jerker (and don't care for spending time with Altman), there are other choices plentiful Monster's Ball (d Marc Foster); In the Bedroom (d Todd Field); Lantana (d Ray Lawrence); A Beautiful Mind (d Ron Howard); I Am Sam (d Jessie Nelson); or a swash-buckling revival of Alexandre Dumas adventure Count of Monte Cristo, The (d Kevin Reynolds).

Quite simply, some people will see this film as a masterwork and others will see it as a complete mess.I think the trick to appreciating this movie is to realize that every element of the film in some way serves the fundamental theme The line between Upstairs and Downstairs may seem very thin, especially behind closed doors, yet the social structure ultimately endures.  If this structure should be compromised, it is almost invariably the servant class that will suffer.The murder mystery storyline merely serves as a backdrop against which the social relationships are exposed.  The plot is so secondary that the film is admittedly quite boring to watch despite the biting social commentary. Consider yourself warned. "},{"Title":"The Butler did it!","Date":"10 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  With the assistance of a collaboration with Bob Balaban, an exceptional screenplay by Julian Fellowes, a cast of Britain's finest, and charmingly dreary sets and cinematography, Robert Altman returns to prime form in Gosford Park.  Against the backdrop of a meeting of aristocrats, their army of servants, and a spying but strangely unobservant movie producer and his `man' for a weekend of daily hunting and nightly gathering and the inevitable murder which results from such activities at the movies, Gosford Park explores the relationship between the classes in 1930's Britain. The main plot faithfully follows the English `whodunit' paradigm---a weekend at an isolated ancient family manse, an assembly of friends and relatives all of whom are relatively unfriendly, unexpected guests of uncertain pedigree, back-stair shadows and whispers, a moment when the likely suspects have all vanished, a murder, the appearance of a detective, a passing comment recognized as critical by a great mind, and, finally, a solution to the mystery. But, by using customary formula, Altman is able to explore subplots and variations on familiar themes.  For example, one of the movie's most marked departures from its model is the importance of the servants.  Rarely, in 1930's murder mysteries, does the butler actually do anything other than wait on his master.  Instead, these characters have traditionally formed part of the moving scenery; even at Gosford Park the upstairs guests treat them as near automatons.  In Gosford Park, however, the servants also have secrets, emotions, and intelligence to hide and to reveal.Increasing the main cast by two or three fold to include the servants, however, poses certain problems.  Some of the minor characters are introduced and almost immediately and completely forgotten.  Conversely, Altman spends considerable time creating rich stories for many characters through a slow series of hints and whispers.  As a result, the plot movement lags and stalls.  At the beginning it was almost tedious to follow who was who, who did what to whom and who belonged in which household.  The purpose, however, of much of the early garbled gossip and banter is to mirror the history of the real mystery and is not critical to understanding the film's resolution. There are, of course, many secrets at Gosford Park, and it is through many of these secrets that Altman explores the class structure and the state of that institution in pre-WWII Britain.  Secret babies, averted pregnancies, cash-flow shortages, and WWI dodgers speak to the crumbling of the rigid class system and the rise of middle-class opportunity.  Not every character's motivations and secrets, however, are explained by the movie's end.  This lack of revelation, however, gives the movie a feeling that there is more to tell, that if it could, the stories would continue outside the confines of the script.  Altman uses this tactic often, but it works well in Gosford Park perhaps because Altman convinces the audience that it is a good idea to leave the structure of Gosford Park. Altman also uses the subplots as studies in contrasts and comparisons. The boredom and coldness of the wealthy is contrasted with the industry and capacity for feeling of the servants.  Conversely, both the upstairs and the downstairs, on the whole, enjoy a juicy piece of gossip or a midnight tryst. Each group is also a gaggle of consummate snobs --- note both groups' disdain for Mabel's (Claudie Blakley) cheap green dress and the seating arrangements at the indoor servants' table.  Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas) and Constance, Countess Trentham (Maggie Smith) both direct nasty quips toward the suave actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northram), but they are too full of hubris to realize that they and their way of life are about to become a Hollywood caper comedy at the hands of Morris Weisman (Balaban).Moreover, each major character seems to have at least one double.  There are two characters whose wealth is rooted in the industrial age, Sir William (Michael Gambon) who is fawned after by the upstairs visitors because of his factory made fortune and Mabel who is dismissed by all because her family's factory did not produce enough cash.  At least two people desire money from Sir William; while Freddy (James Wilby) is a crafty amateur extortionist, Lt. Meredith (Tom Hollander) is a jam-loving man-child of open desperation. Several servants have changed names and identities, sets of sisters abound, and would-be mothers skulk in every corner.  There are even three sleuths (but only one great detective). The ease with which all the actors in Gosford Park handle their intricate roles is superb.  Kelly MacDonald as Constance's underestimated maid is stunning and intelligent as she takes in every secret and revelation with a disingenuous eye.  Clive Owen's Mr. Parks is tortured, sexy and righteous and even at the end, we are uncertain if he is a hero or villain.  As the would-be valet Ryan Phillipe is a comic eros---so certain of his beauty; so horrible about knowing his place, so oblivious to convention.  Stephen Frye, stepping out of the butler's role is hilarious (laughter cannot be suppressed when he tells the constable that they have people to sweep up evidence).  Balaban is perfectly ridiculous as producer who is on the phone conversing about his English countryside whodunit so much that he misses all the action including the murder!  Kristin Scott Thomas and Maggie Smith do not disappoint playing cold witty bitches.  Emily Watson is enthralling as the practical yet wishful Elsie---she can get even a jaded audience to gasp when she speaks out of hand.  Northram and Blackley are, respectively, suave and humble, and they have surprisingly good chemistry together in the drawing room scene.  The rest of the cast also deserves individual praise for their skill and willingness to take on small parts with such zest.  In this category, Derek Jacobi is the most notable; he barely has three lines.Overall, Gosford Park is worth the time and attention.  It is sophisticated, engaging, illuminating and, simply, entertaining.

Not surprising, however, that most of the disgruntled viewers should have had no real idea what to expect from a Robert Altman film when they went into the cinema. This was never going to be a straightforward Agatha Christie-type murder mystery, in fact it went some way to subverting 1930s country-house whodunnit conventions, not least, as someone else pointed out, by making the detective a clueless duffer and thereby avoiding the climactic 'we shall all convene in the drawing room at eight o'clock when I will unmask the murderer' denouement.At the same time, I disagree with the notion that the murder mystery element of the film was almost an afterthought, tied up as it was with everything else the movie was trying to convey. (To say more would warrant a spoiler warning.) Those who worked it out before the truth came explicitly to light and criticized the film as a result are obviously better at sussing out detective fiction that me (and I admit I've always been lousy at it); to them I would simply say that you can understand a murder plot without beginning to get your head around a subtle study of the intricacies of the British class structure. And to fail to appreciate as large a gathering of British screen and theatre actors working at the height of their powers as you're ever likely to see again is a very sad thing indeed.9/10.

Five minutes in and Becky leant over and gushed in my left ear `This is wonderful!' I nodded my agreement. The film is deliciously wicked as it allows the viewer to observe the idiosyncrasies of people who are unaware they process any. The plot is not overly complex and is certainly not the strength of this movie. The structure of this film is in its interplay of characters and the contrast between the vital world below stairs and the bored existence of the upper classes. The introduction of an American into this world provides an alien perspective though which the audience can identify.  	 One of the complexities of the film is in remembering who's who, especially upstairs. `Which one's Lord Stockton?' whispered Gina in my right ear. And a discussion on the journey home revealed that Becky believed Sylvia's sister was her daughter, which would have given her a very odd relationship with Bill!  My advice is to pay attention to those casual introductions you will be tested later!I also wished that I had known more about the Charlie Chan movies that the American supposedly produced. Research afterwards revealed that there were a series of thirties B movies in which a Chinese detective competently solved crimes. Thus Stephen Fry's bumbling detective is an antithesis of this fictional character. Perhaps there is an element of truth in that a modern audience, used to watching TV detectives gather evidence and solve crimes, are more knowledgeable about the methods of deduction than a nineteen-thirties, English, police inspector would have been. As Stephen Fry's performance has been highlighted in several reviews as the weakest link perhaps I am looking to justify it. However as the audience I was with definitely found it amusing perhaps that is sufficient justification for its presence.One of the advice bytes a writer is always reading is &#145;show don't tell'. Early in the movie Elsie (Emily Watson) warns Mary (Kelly MacDonald) of &#145;George's wandering hands'. However throughout the movie there is no indication of this vice from George (Richard E Grant). Although nicotine addiction and a willingness not to waste good wine are displayed! In a film of outstanding performances Richard's was one of my favourites, with his malicious remarks and permanent expression of disdain there was a definite edge to his presence in any scene. Another character I enjoyed watching was Mabel (Claudie Blakley), the wife of the obnoxious Nesbit (James Wilby) who had only been invited to make up numbers. She is the female outsider in this upper class habitat and is easy to overlook as unimportant. No character in this tableau is unimportant. The most memorable dialogue is in the expert hands of Maggie Smith who delivers it with such a wonderful, naivety that she reminded me of my 7 year old, who seems to specialise in outrageous comments issued in total innocence. My impression, from the recent Altman Omnibus, was that the director wanted to remove that &#145;air of knowing' which permeates most period dramas. In the finished product I was aware of his success in this endeavour. The film is a glimpse into a moment of people's lives. Everyone is busy with their own lives, and, particularly with the staff, we are conscious of their individuality. There are reflections on the past, but there is a stronger awareness of the present. The future has not happened yet. The death of the master may force the sale of the house, there may be a trial, a film may be made and a war may be coming, but in the meantime the silver has to be polished, and meals cooked and served.Finally, before you all think this hierarchical society is part of British history. I recently viewed a documentary on Windsor Castle where a servant was measuring the distances between place settings, for a banquet, exactly as George had in Gosford Park. A dying breed yes, but please do not make the mistake of thinking it extinct yet.

There is so little new to this film that one half-seriously wonders if plagarism lawyers are working feverishly at his studio to protect this so-called Oscar-worthy performance.This film teaches us that rich people are sluts and scoundrels obsessed with their petty squabbles (we knew that already). It entertains us by giving us almost two hours of set up, 10 minutes of rising action and then with 10 minutes left a climax. The tagline tea at 4...murder by midnight is right...It does seem like it takes 8 hours for the climax to get there.There are many who claim that this film is artistic and that Altman is a genius for interweaving so many storylines into the piece. I however contend that no storyteller ever becomes great by confusing his audience, by intentionally adding in more characters than he knows what to do with, by underdeveloping the characters to such a point that they only reinforce how one-dimensional and cliched they really are, by adding scene after scene to show the same thing, and by slowing the pace to the point that more happens in the theater itself than the film in the course of the showing. Yes, some great works of art do confuse the masses, but that doesn't mean that all films that confuse the masses are great.This film in essence is like the sentence Murder, sex, at, rich, clothes, servants, dogs, jokes, stupid Americans---There's just too much detail and no real point to it.

Downs are rare - Stephen Fry seeming to be inspired by Jacques Tati is bad characterisation rather than bad acting.Overall, however, the main heavy-handedness is in the over-emphasis on the callous disregard of the masters for their servants.

By Hollywood standards, the studio that made this picture did not have to mortgage Planet Earth to get it produced.  In addition, this film did not sink to the lowest common denominators with bathroom humor, nor did it rely on spectacular special effects for it to be a great movie.  Robert Altman's direction, which deserves much credit for this brilliant film, keeps us interested as the storyline moves along.  Though the cast is full of many characters, we can easily identify with those characters.  The characters in this film are distinctive from one another, which is one of the signs of a great film.   Once again, Maggie Smith, as the Countess of Trentham, gives her usual brilliant performance.  She stands head-and-shoulders above the rest of the cast, which is the highest compliment since I was pleased with ALL the performances.  Kristin Scott Thomas gives one of her best performances as the perfect 'snob'.  If she is overlooked by her peers, it would be a shame, because she was incredibly believable.  I usually do not take notice of the writing unless William Goldman is the screenwriter, but I have so much respect for actor Julian Fellowes for writing the film's screenplay. It is his first major motion picture success as a screenwriter, and what a success it is!  Gosford Park is intelligent and witty.  A good portion of movies today are not intelligent - or the writing tries to dumb-us-down to grade school levels.  Gosford Park credits the audience for being intelligent enough to understand the intellectual plot, witticisms and one-liners.  I have added Gosford Park to my long list of favorite films.

Director Robert Altman does an excellent job with an average screenplay by Julian Fellowes.  Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren and Clive Owen are the stand outs and the tone of the movie is vintage Altman with a little bit of James Ivory's flavour thrown in for good measure.

It seems that most people that really love movies hold one of two positions on Altman.  They love him or hate him.  I don't mind two hours of little to no plot as long as I have good actors to watch and this movie has them.  If you are an Altman fan or if you are willing to wait while the plot comes slowly to the front, then go see this movie now.  If you don't like Altman films with their large and confusing casts and want the action up front and moving along all of the time, then don't go to see this movie.Altman's movies are epic in the sense that there is a large scope to the story and an interesting tangent doesn't have to detract from the overall story.  The story that is told includes more than the bare bones of the story to be told.  The full story could be told in just a paragraph or two. But brevity would destroy the story.  The story is characters and their relationships.I see one or two movies a week at the theater and I have noticed in the last few months that the movies are getting better and that more people are going to see them.  When I went to Gosford Park the theater was FULL!  All of the seats were certainly not filled in the past for Short Cuts or Kansas City and not even for the more mainstream Altman pics of The Player or Dr. T and His Women.

No, you CAN'T identify who's who, or who's who's servant is, or what the relationships are amongst the host family and their guests. Anyone who hasn't seen and appreciated the 99% British actors' previous works (i.e., anyone under 25, and certainly not a general audience) wouldn't have a clue who Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Eileen Aitkins and Michael Gambon were. If I hadn't known myself, I'd have been as lost as anyone else! There's nothing here that either Ivory or Kenneth Branaugh couldn't have done a better job with, with a lot more polish to boot (no pun).That said, there are two reasons to see this movie (maybe at a cheaper, rainy-day matinee) Maggie Smith and Emily Watson. Smith is as great as she's ever been, playing the kind of character -- the slightly soiled socialite -- that no one else can. She's completely delicious. And Watson's turn as a worldly housemaid is perhaps the most fully formed character in the film we know where she's been, we don't know where she'll end up, but there's no doubt she will survive. But once again, these talented actresses could have pulled off these performances under anyone's direction, not singularly Altman's. If there's an Oscar he deserves, it's the Thalberg for the body of his work, the good, the bad and the ugly. And who knows he could still end up with this year's, just so he's guaranteed a consolation prize. "},{"Title":"Spoilers?

Beginning with the characters, I must admit that they seemed a bit stereotypical and one-dimensional. A good example is Maggie Smith's Costance. Although I have read numerous accounts of her acid wit, and I agree that her timing is impeccable, it is nothing you couldn't get from a good BBC comedy. Further, her character seems to exist only for the cruel treatment of Kelly MacDonald's Mary and to unload her sarcastic zingers. Perhaps the problem was that Altman casted so many good actors that he forgot that developing them might be important. That said, I quite enjoyed MacDonald's Mary as the ingenue, Helen Mirren's stern yet troubled Mrs. Wilson, and Stephen Fry's fatuous, bumbling Inspector Thompson.Turning to the plot, it was somewhat familiar territory. Although I can't say that I am a fan of English class-addled epics, Altman does produce a reasonable pastiche of UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, LA REGLE DU JEU, and various Agatha Christie murder novel devices, complete with the surprise revelation of the bastard kin. It was a fun romp, but nothing spectacular.Turning to the Altman-esque elements (cut-away shots that emphasize the emotions of foreground characters reacting to background events, overlapping dialogue and emotional sincerity), the film has all that you would expect from the man who brought us M*A*S*H, NASHVILLE, THE PLAYER, and COOKIE'S FORTUNE. I have always liked Altman's cinematic vision and was not let down here.

And I appreciate a few other Altman movies, not all of them. But I've come to respect GP as a very nuanced, layered movie after viewing it again a few times. Here Altman appropriates a set-up familiar to those who've seen The Rules of the Game, and turns it into a whodunit. But terming the film a 'whodunit' will surely cause disappointment, as who done it? is nowhere near as interesting as the depiction of hordes of servants lingering in the wings to support an enfeebled upper class. And even more intriguing is why an unexpected character can solve the crime, but the police inspector can't.The movie presents a world teetering on the edge of Depression, in which a crime can't be solved because information needs to be exchanged between two strata of a cross-section of English society; but the social order is so codified (the gentry and the service) that they do not meaningfully interact. No one who's ambitious can bear to interact with the servants - And due to a dehumanizing class convention, the gentry doesn't even know their last names. In the end, a fawning, class conscious inspector can't solve the crime, but a lowly maid, who enjoys the most relaxed relationship with her superior seen in the movie - and thus moves easiest between the two worlds - uses information gleaned from both worlds to solve the murder, and the mystery.Just after everyone is let off the hook, the credits roll and a song performed by Jeremy Northam underscores the bifurcation that results in two classes, hitting you with the message Somewhere there's another land different than this world below (get it?), far more mercifully planned than the cruel place we know. For the previous two and a half hours, social boundaries have for once resulted in mercy for the lower class. The oppressive system has, in an unusual twist, worked in favor of the servants this time.I have small problems with the movie but it IS smart. And 'boring movies, as some have termed this, offer you space to think, instead of just sitting there passively distracted by equally meaningless surface activity. There is much more to say and multiple ways to receive the film, but I've hit on my major points. It works on different levels; other people are free to say other smart things about it.

The fault is in Julian Fallowes's clich√©d script, which is P.G. Wodehouse without the funny bits. Every member of the upper crust is merely a twit, a cad, a fraud, a boor and/or a snob. We are invited at first to sympathy with the host, a nouveau riche industrialist of intelligence, energy and ability, but he turns out to be more vile in his own way than the genteel parasites who cluster around him. There isn't the slightest redeeming human quality in any of them. Only below stairs is any humanity to be found. If Jeeves had vented all his spleen in a memoir after 30 years of valeting for Bertie Wooster, it would have read something like this script.Renoir understood three things to which Fallowes and Altman seem tone deaf. First, even people cursed with having been born to privilege, or some of them,can be decent and interesting human beings within the conventions of their caste. Second, the conventions of the pre-capitalist aristocracy, however decayed they had become, put a high value on the personal virtues of courage, honor and integrity. Third, in a system where class lines are clearly drawn and well understood, there can be a peculiar personal intimacy between master and servant. Because Renoir grasped these things, Rules of the Game was complex. Because Fallowes does not, Gosford Park is only complicated.The script simply has no patience with these people. Its undergraduate radical view of the upper class means that it misses some of the dramatic opportunities inherent in an aristocracy on its last legs. Freddie Nesbitt would be a more interesting swine, and Commander Meredith a more desperate pathetic failure, if one of the other upper class males, Lord Stockbridge for instance, exemplified the standard they had failed to live up to. Isobel, Sir William's daughter, is thrown away as a character because Altman doesn't use her relationship with Elsie, the Head Housemaid, to open her up. Even a few minutes of dialog between Elsie and Sir William would have gotten us under his surface. But Altman simply doesn't want to get under the surface of the people above the stairs. He is interested in only the servants as human beings, Those they serve, like the American guests at the Jamaican hotel in Smile Orange, are just a ridiculous but burdensome part of the environment in which the lives of the real people go on.

Several of the grips were in the audience, along with a couple of best boys.  I took some notes1.  There are so many characters in Gosford Park it's impossible to keep track of who they are and what they're up to.  Some are utterly superfluous, like the two guys who arrive late, by car.  I realize this may very well be a satire on British who-done-its of the 1930s, which tended to overwhelm American audiences with their excessive cast of characters.2.  The accents make listening to the dialog excruciating.  Despite bravado demos of sound systems by the likes of THX, with its pin-drop-in-the-puddle, the clear recording of human speech still needs work.3.  The film is morally abrasive and unsatisfying.  While no one regrets the murder of you know who, it bothers me that the Countess (Maggie Smith) does not go unpunished.  Her treatment of her maid, beautifully played by Mary Macreachran, is cruel, and in the year 2002 should not be tolerated without some kind of comeuppance.4.  And yet, the film is great fun to watch, partly because it satirizes the genre, film-making, and actors. There are homages to Rules of the Game (the pheasant shoot) and The Wizard of Oz (Here, Dorothy, you take the dog.)  Watching Maggie Smith is a joy, but by now, a predictable one. I felt Eileen Atkins's performance was more deeply human.  I thought the talents of Ryan Phillippe were wasted, and his role too casually discarded. Helen Mirren, naturally, ruled.5.  The one enchanting sequence in the film is the musical entertainment by Jeremy Northam in the role of Ivor Novello.  Singing his own material at the piano, he welds almost the entire household, upstairs and downstairs, into an audience enraptured by art. Altman's camera records it all, lovingly, like a wonderful divertisement.  Strange that Altman should award the prize for enchantment not to film, but to music.

Some critics have likened the film to Upstairs, Downstairs but Altman and his superb cast had to create their 1932 fun-and-games soiree in about two and a half hours and they succeed admirably.  Listing the main actors alphabetically was clearly the right thing to do - this is a true ensemble effort.What do the upper crust of an England recovering from one war while blundering unpreparedly towards another do?  They shoot birds, down quite a bit of alcohol, indulge in some cross-class bed hopping and generally insure that few marks of intelligence will be observable.  What occupies the days and nights of the downstairs staff?  Well, they don't shoot birds.For those who savored Upstairs, Downstairs or some of the Merchant Ivory films depicting a languorous and somewhat useless titled class, the characters here are  faux  representations of those already familiar.  The butler is a bit like Hudson but with layers of complexity that open up gradually.  There is a Mrs. Bridges but she has a melancholy side to offset her steely command of her domain. Helen Mirren is subtly touching as a chief housekeeper with secrets.  And the CID inspector most assuredly is not based on Hercule Poirot's Inspector Japp.Kristin Scott Thomas, a wonderful actress, slides preternaturally into the role of a bored, beautiful and morally rootless presiding hostess.  She elides through the circles of visitors more as a spectator than one truly involved with her guests (about whom she probably doesn't give a farthing).Mr. Wiseman, definitely Non-U, is a bemused Hollywood producer of Charlie Chan films basically out of his element but trying to absorb the flavor of the country set.There are a number of sub-plots and some of the dialogue is hard to catch.  A better job of sound editing would have helped rather a lot.  Patrick Doyle's score is very nice and the music complements the many scenes.This is a much better film than most others in this familiar genre.  Altman was in good form but he also had the actors and actresses to raise to a level of high interest what might well have been a mirthful but essentially shallow parody.

In Britain of 1932, NO ONE said things like No worries! or End of story!. There are other linguistic anachronisms, but these two are the worst ones. Both expressions are examples of modern estuary English and no educated person would ever utter either. The wealthy, the landed gentry, and the aristocracy in England would never even have heard this type of expression; in fact, they had not yet been invented. The ghastly, interminable soap EastEnders has a lot to answer for regarding the debasement of British English, as has the never-ending Australian soap Neighbours.The plot is very derivative and there are glaring flaws and holes in the narrative. In some ways, Gosford Park reminds me of an Agatha Christie mystery but the plot simply doesn't hang together. HOW did the housekeeper KNOW that the son she gave up shortly after giving birth to him 31 years previously would kill his natural father? For that matter, HOW did she even know WHO he was? She had not seen her son since he was ca two weeks old! He was brought up in an orphanage, and at the age of 31 he is now the valet of Lord Stockbridge, who just happens to have been invited to stay at the country house belonging to Sir William, the man who fathered an illegitimate son on one of his female factory workers 32 years earlier. This woman is now the housekeeper at his, Sir William's, country house. That in itself is rather odd, to say the least. HOW did the valet KNOW that Sir William was his natural father? He states to a fellow servant that on his birth certificate it said Father unknown. There are far too many incidents of the two terrible twins contrivance and coincidence.

The story is lovely, with some great whodunit elements and themes such as class and social interaction.The acting is very good. Stephen Fry is delightfully comic, and Ryan Phillippe is also decent. And while Kelly MacDonald does really well in the pivotal role, and Jeremy Northam and Michael Gambon are great value, it is Maggie Smith who steals the show in effortless bitchy mode.Overall, a great and hugely entertaining film and one of Altman's best.

Other films touch on the same ground - Merchant Ivory's Remains of the Day most notably, and perhaps The Shooting Party. But these are totally different films although set with similar characters and in a similar milieu. (How on earth is that bloody word spelled? - But I am sure you get my drift.)

It didn't for me at first. However, after looking a little deeper into things I discovered something surprising. Gosford Park has been nominated and even won various awards to date. Looking through all these awards made me look forward to seeing the film. As I began to think about what I was going to see, I remembered a colleague mentioning that there were multiple principal characters. Once the movie began I understood why there would be a large cast. I was now ready to sit back and enjoy a day in Gosford Park.It is November 1932. Gosford Park is the magnificent country estate to which Sir William McCordle and his wife, Lady Sylvia, gather relations and friends for a shooting party. Invited are a countess, a World War I hero, the British idol Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) and an American film producer. As the guests assemble in the drawing rooms above, their personal maids and valets swell the ranks of the house servants in the teeming kitchens and corridors below. But all is not as it seems neither amongst the elegant guests lunching and dining at their considerable leisure, nor in the attic bedrooms and stark work stations where the servants labor for the comfort of their employers. Part comedy of manners and part mystery, the film is finally a moving portrait of events that bridge generations, class, sex, tragic personal history and culminate in a murder. The entire movie revolves around William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and the desire of the others to have his estate and all that it is worth. As the weekend goes on we learn more about the other characters in the play and we also learn about some of the secrets kept inside the house. It seems as if everyone in the house, whether they are upstairs or downstairs, is interested in what they are to receive. The question remains how can they get it? I feel that Altman did a great job of showing the separation of the classes and directing the large cast to not make me feel as though there were that many characters. There were the upstairs and then there were the downstairs. Each area was separated through the stark, dark lights downstairs and the bright golden touch upstairs. There was one unifying element to the movie. All the people regardless of location were arranged in order of their rank or their master's rank. This made it so no matter where you were in the house you always had someone above or below you, in more ways than one. If you happen to be interested in murder mystery films. Then you would definitely enjoy, Robert Altman and Bob Balaban's Gosford Park. Here is their schedule for the day. They will be having tea at four, dinner at eight and murder at midnight.

Everything feels somewhat authentic to what it was in Britain in early 1900s, at least for me (but I'm not an expert, I'm not even British ) ). The setting was a gathering of some of British elites, where some wealthy men and women came to a fellow rich man's mansion to go hunting for a few days. In the interactions among these people, the filmmaker's showing us how these 'lords' and 'ladies' think and live their lives. And since it's their servants that for most part make them 'lords' and 'ladies'; the servants are important parts of their lives. And the servants are important parts of this movie as well. The 'lords' and 'ladies' have their own world and so do the servants. And sometimes the two worlds intertwine, naturally some might say. All in all, the movie mocks the class system in those days, and I enjoy watching it. The characters are rich in variety. Some are charming, some are selfish, and some are very boring. But every one of them makes the movie works. The acting is fantastic. One thing that I somewhat regret is that the filmmaker did this gathering setting (which means it involves many many characters) so 'real' (the filmmaker didn't do much effort to introduce the characters in order to let the movie flows very naturally. And he succeeded), that it's quite hard to know every one of them. I had two or three characters that I could only guessed who's who. Some words of caution, if you look for a story, you may be left wanting, especially in the end. For me, the movie gives a setting rather than a story. And it's perfectly fine for me. It's a good movie.

Where Scorsese plunges into gritty crime-infested streets, Altman shifts his setting onto something infinitely more pleasant an off-London country estate in November 1932, filled with lords, ladies, counts and their servants and peppered with upper-class rapid-fire dialogue.The ensemble is largely at focus, consisting of a multitude of mostly British actors. The camera dawdles and intimately stalks these people during 2 days or so &#150; whether they are lords or maids &#150; expertly navigating every little detail of their lives from the plates that they use to the silk boas that they wear. Naturally, this invests the film with the utmost cozy atmosphere. What is most admirable is that Altman somehow lets us thoroughly get to know ALL of his characters, in spite of there being so many and in spite of ultimately mostly offering us trivial details about them. Although there is no protagonist, Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith and Clive Owen all tip over into this territory at several points in the film, only to be firmly placed in the backseat once against to make room for other characters in the country estate. Their interactions are wonderfully dynamic; their dialogue snaps and crackles like kindling in a fireplace.So is there a story at all? Why yes, certainly. 'Gosford Park' is embroidered in intrigue that delicately interweaves all its characters; central to the events is a murder that takes place at midnight. Perhaps the reason why Altman follows his ensemble around everywhere they go so patiently in the film is in search for an answer who was the murderer? What were their motives? Gosford Park undoubtedly offers much to choose from &#150; pride, envy, snobbery, lost love, greed... and more. Yet, much like Scorsese, you get the feeling many scenes do not really surve any purpose other than to give us a feel for the way things are run or to establish the atmosphere.

Given its strictness, it is not a genre that one would normally associate with director Robert Altman, who has built a career on a style that gives equal weight to myriads of detail both important and inconsequential and then draws all into a multi-layered thematic whole. And yet in GOSFORD PARK Altman's peculiar style serves not only his broader intent, it serves the genre as well--and it does so to great effect.Like most Altman films, GOSFORD PARK presents us with a wide array of personalities, in this case shown against the backdrop of a 1930s English countryside shooting party where a number of unsavory story lines unfold before us in the form of remarks overheard in passing and details caught out of the corner of the eye. And in this respect, Altman becomes almost as Agatha Christie as Christie herself, distracting us with certain relationships and events even while he clearly specifies the drift toward murder--and the motive behind it--in clear view at one side.But like most Altman films, GOSFORD PARK is about a great deal more than any simple plot summary can indicate. Even while presenting us with a classic murder mystery it is as much about the cruelty of a rigid class system and the manner in which it distorts the personalities of both master and servant, even at a point in time when the control of the ruling class has begun to slip. Surprisingly, however, even these themes play into both the crime and its solution, and the result is a much neater package than generally found in an Altman film.Altman, who works in a mosaic-like style, is an extremely problematic director in the sense that you either like his work a great deal or you dislike it with considerable intensity. GOSFORD PARK, which features a particularly fine ensemble cast even for an Altman film, will not change the opinion of either group, and for all its success the film does not attain the same shocking sharpness and breadth of his penultimate statement, NASHVILLE. But even so, it is Altman at his best and in an somewhat more accessible form than usual, and I recommend it very strongly.Gary F.

The action centers around Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas), who host a shooting party at their mansion, Gosford Park. Guests arrive for the weekend, bringing trusted servants with them, and we are presented with parallel stories of the lives of those above stairs, and those below. Intrigue abounds in both worlds, and their intersections occur in surprising places. When Sir William turns up dead, the suspects are many, and an investigation turns up a few secrets, but it is ultimately, Mary Maceachran (Kelly Macdonald), servant to Constance Trentham (Maggie Smith), who turns up the most surprising secret of all.The script contains a number of plots and subplots, all of which are handled with surprising alacrity. Points of view shift constantly, but not in a confusing way, and never to the detriment of the story. The investigation adds an interesting element to the story without overpowering it. And in the end, neither the servants nor the masters are presented as being the better world to belong to.The movie is an ensemble piece, and as such, boasts a number of strong performances without anyone overshadowing any of the others. Thomas is her usual ice princess, but since Lady Sylvia isn't especially likable, her performance works. Michael Gambon's gruffness works well for Sir William. Maggie Smith is wonderful as a pampered old woman, and Macdonald is equally charming as her inquisitive servant. Jeremy Northram is exceptional as Ivor Novello.

Downstairs, hostility between housekeeper Helen Mirren and cook Eileen Atkins builds to a moving, revelatory confrontation without impeding butler Alan Bates' regulation of the staff.Holding their own in this company are Americans Bob Balaban (Altman's partner in the conception and production) as a coolly-received Hollywood producer and Ryan Phillippe, affecting a purposefully dubious accent, as his highly suspicious valet. Jeremy Northam is just divine as matin√©e idol Ivor Novello, who's presence provokes sniffs from the aristos but excites the housemaids.The pivotal character is Kelly Macdonald's Mary, the new lady's maid whose quiet labours position her perfectly to observe the misbehaviour and foibles above and below stairs with perception and sympathy. And although Dame Maggie Smith's imperious countess grabs the largest share of memorable lines, everyone has his moment in this inventive and fully-detailed piece. That includes the valet protesting, I've washed him and I've dressed him, and if he can't find his own way to the drawing room it's not my fault! This is Altman's best movie in years - an astute exploration of British culture that can stand proudly with his satires of American life. Atmospheric, absorbing, amusing and really fun.9/10 "},{"Title":"One of my Top 5 favorite movies","Date":"11 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  I have never been all that interested in early 30s Britian. This film certainly turned me around. I have watched the film about a dozen times and am still taken back by the hyper attention to detail. I get amused when someone refers to Gosford Park as a murder mystery. The murder is secondary to the plot, if that. This movie is all about the British class system. For me, the most interesting thing is to watch is the dependency the landed gentry had on the servant class. Another element is the class stratification that occurred upstairs extended to the downstairs as well. An interesting point one of the downstairs characters made was Why do we live our lives through theirs? The interaction between the characters is very interesting to watch. The acting was absolutely first class. The direction, up to Altman's usual standards. One thing I don't usually mention is the movie sounds track. It complemented the movie quite well. I will say it is the first movie sound track I have ever purchased. I am quite comfortable placing this movie in my top 5 favorites.

The movie isn't about who killed William McCordle. Instead, it beautifully illustrates how and why the British aristocracy disappeared in the 12 years that followed the year in which the film is set. Perfect only when viewed from a distance, life at Gosford Park is doomed. The house will be sold and turned into a geriatric hospital. The staff, apart from Emily Watson who's off to wrap Hollywood round her little finger, will all find new jobs on the underground or in Department Stores, where they'll mix with upper class twits like Fox and Wilby who will discover that hanging on to Lord So&So's coattails no longer provides a viable living. The war will come and at the end of it, the British people will vote to strip this lot of their last penny to buy a welfare state (and a decent police service!).It's all there, you just have to get onto the right wavelength and realise (as more than one American reviewer has) that you're watching the very best of the craft of movie making at work. Altman and his crew may be working on a small canvas, like Jane Austen did, but they're addressing great issues. The film is a jewel box of quality performances. Watch Charles Dance as he's introduced to Morris Weissman, Maggie Smith when Novello is singing, Geraldine Somerville and Kristen Scott Thomas as they greet each other for the first time or just marvel at the fact that Sir Derek Jacobi is 24th on the cast list and still has Richard E Grant below him.Sure the murder mystery wouldn't sustain Angela Lansbury between two commercial breaks. Who cares? Our world turned on its head in the 20th century and THAT'S what Gosford Park is about. And hats off to Robert Altman for a terrific, mature piece that will stand the test of time. His murder mystery with no mystery is right up there with M.A.S.H. his pivotal war film with no war.

It is true there is a murder, and that is where similarities to usual murder mysteries ends.  However, Hollywood chose to market this as some sort of P.G. Wodehouse comedy about class morals and etiquette.  I think this a big reason why many people here did not like it, and it's understandable; they were simply led to believe it was going to be a very different film.  Although theres' some funny moments, it is more or less a drama, not a comedy and not even really a murder mystery.I just watched Gosford Park for the first time now, and I know, like a great book, it's going to be a movie I watch again and again.  Like almost all of Altman's movies, we are simply dropped right in the middle of the action from the beginning.  We eavesdrop on seemingly dozens of conversations, so many that the first hour or so is quite a confusing and even frustrating experience.  But then, as in Altman's masterpiece Nashville, the story suddenly snaps together and we realize that this movie isn't about the murder at all (just like Nashville really wasn't just about the country music business), but rather the circumstances and social powers that led to it.Gosford Park is quite a subversive and, at its heart, even angry film.  It is not just an attack on the British class system, or even on class systems in general, but it is also about the hierarchies and judgments all of us constantly make, everyday.  The servants in the movie maintain every bit of the level of gossiping and social hierarchy of the folks upstairs.  True, the class system and terrible treatment of single mothers at the time ultimately leads to the murder, yet the servants are not free of prejudice, either.This is by far one of Altman's most subtle and powerful films.  It is not his greatest, I agree with others that the detective is just too cartoonish and overbearing, and I tired of the film within a film jokes, which were used brilliantly in The Player, but somehow just didn't seem appropriate here.  In a weird way, I wish it were a tiny bit longer, there was so much left unstated and hanging.  But that is Altman's point, too; our own lives are certainly not neatly folded into plots and subplots that are resolved neatly after two hours, but rather half-remembered conversations, small yet telling gestures or glances, and powerful, truthful moments, such as when one the maids abruptly says that all she really seeks is true love. (Okay, sounds hokey here, but, really, it's a remarkable scene.)  The murdered person in Gosford Park stirs up even more emotions and life-changing moments after he is dead.  And after the movie is over, we can certainly think about the issues it brings up in our own lives.   "},{"Title":"Whodunit? Why bother!","Date":"24 March 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  One should never expect Robert Altman to do the obvious, so when he tackles a genre, he usually goes the long way around and ends up someplace else. His war movie, M*A*S*H, is a black comedy. His musical, NASHVILLE, ends up being a political drama. His satire of Hollywood, THE PLAYER, is a facade for an amoral film noir. So when Altman tackles the classic murder mystery formula, a la Agatha Christie, one is apt to be intrigued by the possibilities. The murder mystery is, by nature, the most structured of all genres in that it is actually a game that is played by the filmmaker and the audience. Whodunit and howtheydidit are the film's secrets that the viewer must discover. Therefore, there are unwritten rules. One must expect Altman to break the rules, yes; ignore them, no.As is, GOSFORD is less a whodunit than an obvious essay on class distinctions. Indeed, for all it is worth the whole murder mystery angle could have been forgotten all together. Having rounded up a remarkable cast of Britain's finest actors, Altman gives them precious little to do Those upstairs set around being arrogant and bored, those downstairs stand around being bitter and stuffy. Along the way, there is a murder and no one seems to care.Therein lies the fatal wound. Everyone treats the killing as if it is, at best, a dreadfully uncouth faux pas, not the social embarrassment it should be for the aristocrats and the threat to the livelihood that it should present for the servants. Okay, that's the joke a murder of an important person who no one will really miss. But if the murder mystery is inconsequential, then Altman owes us a distraction that would also make us indifferent to the violence. He does not deliver.The obvious model for this film is Jean Renoir's classic THE RULES OF THE GAME, a similarly themed film, rich with colorful characters, intriguing plot twists and a general air of orchestrated chaos. Altman's exercise in class confrontation doesn't even come close to matching Renoir's Indeed, it doesn't even come close to matching Altman's own ramshackle satire A WEDDING. A few of Altman's mighty cast, such as Maggie Smith and Jeremy Northram, manage to infuse their roles with a bit of color, but most just seem bored. So will the viewer.

To say it's not only the best film of 2001 but it's also one of Robert Altman's best. Perfectly crafted, 'Gosford Park' plays a game on our eyes as well as our minds with the essence of 1930s England. It's Agatha Christie meets Robert Altman in a short summary. But don't just look at it as a murder mystery, because if you do, you miss out on what Gosford Park has inside it's walls Classic pose, creative intricate plot, and a nostalgic look you won't help but love. If you were to see this as your first Altman film, good job, because this film is simply stunning and amazing. The surprise with the film is the all-out British cast, and it's do so rightfully well that you admire it. Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jeremy Northam, Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Richard E. Grant (Hugh's Brother), Michael Gambon, and Ryan Phillippe are just some of the many cast of the film. The large group may seem like too much for a murder mystery to contain while keeping the flow nice and tight, but that's the joy of the film it fits naturally, with nothing rushed or overacted. You enter the film knowing nobody, and leave knowing everyone and their dark little secrets. While everyone gets their fare share in the film, the one who steals the show is Maggie Smith as Lady Constance Threntham, an old, wise cracking woman who's out to get her respectable allowance from Sir William McCordle (Another stunning performance from Michael Gambon). Unlike directors who burnout jumping the gun on films, Robert Altman continues to shine, and will keep going. Gosford Park is a Disney World in film-making.

Not it.","Date":"31 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  This movie will be a severe disappointment if you are looking for an engaging murder mystery. From the very beginning I started to make mental notes as to who the would-be killer would be (there is a host of deliciously aristocratic characters and even a charismatic actor character who belts out showtunes).   I anticipated great fun.  All this set in a definitive English country house complete with hunting grounds.   Lavish settings, with lavish characters.   I was expecting a multi-layered whodunnit which would have me guessing till the very shocking end.Except this movie was not what I expected. First, despite the nigh 3hour runtime, there really wasn't much character development.  Who are these people, really? We are allowed next to nothing on their backgrounds/personalities short of quick introductions heard from the mouths of gossiping maids.  Save a general air of importance and wealth, the characters are not fleshed out.Then there's the climax, if you want to call it that.  The investigator was a complete waste of screen time, and contributed nothing. He was no Sherlock Holmes, and the movie would not have been any different with/without him. Unfortunately, the same could be said of most every character.   Since they were not developed (as per my first gripe), any one character did not hold more suspicion than another.   Nor did we care for any character.  There was no dark, brooding,  wary, or  paranoid atmosphere you would expect to have followed after a killing. The characters were the same bland characters they were before.   They were certain surprises, but they were completely arbitrary, like the background of one of the characters with a shady accent.And I have to mention the way the details behind the crime were eventually brought to light. As mentioned before, there was no sleuthing for us viewers to follow along.  It was essentially one character with abrupt epiphanies who would confront suspects with a `Why did you do it??'  It has to be mentioned here that the suspects express no surprise but instead immediately confides to her their disgust for the victim.  And no one seems to be aware or frightened of the repercussions.  It was almost as if a murder did not occur. Crimes are discovered and confessed yet no one alerts the authorities, and everyone goes their way, and then the movie ends.This was no murder mystery.  Watch this film if you like the setting., or enjoy ensemble casts. But that's about all this film has to offer. And I have to say, anyone who gave this stellar reviews is either a diehard Altman fan, or of the type quick to jump on the bandwagon and praise anything British.

As is typical with Altman films, one has to really pay attention or risk missing a crucial detail.  Altman himself says that he hopes people see this film at least twice.  For the first viewing, the film will be experienced as a typical whodunit in the Christie style.  But instead of a brilliant detective figuring out the mystery, the police detective is a buffoon, and only a servant puzzles things out.  But the film is truly enjoyed with the second viewing.  Gosford park is more a comedy about the British class system than a whodunit.  And the acting is superb  there are easily half a dozen actors who could have stolen the film, including Emily Watson, Clive Owen, Mary McDonell, Maggie Smith and others.  And then one sees an actor of the caliber of Derek Jacobi playing a minor valet!  All the details are perfect.  I was inspired to write this review partly because the review featured at IMDB complained about fake accents.  The only fake accent in the film is Ryan Phillipe's, whose character is an American faking a Scottish accent. The English characters are played by English actors, and the Scottish maid speaks with the same Scottish accent in real life (she is one of many actors who is included in the features in the DVD - I highly recommend the DVD for anybody who missed this in the cinema.)In summary, a delight and a true Altman masterpiece.

Featuring a dream cast of England's most prominent actors, such as Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas, Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon or Alan Bates, this is a movie which offers at least five Oscarworthy performances (most notably Maggie Smith and Emily Watson, in my opinion). It was a sheer delight to see Alan Bates for example, who played in a string of wonderful films in the sixties and seventies (Women in Love and the Go-Between are my favourites). I have to mention Kelly MacDonald (from Trainspotting), who is marvellous in the role of Mary.    The film is a really haunting crime-mystery but it also can be seen as a social commentary on the English class system - and this aspect of the film is more interesting. Old traditions, deviations, greed, snobbery and decadence characterise the lives of the upper-class and the lower-class as well. We see that neither the aristocrats nor their servants are normal people - only the newcomer Mary (Kelly MacDonald) seem to be a down-to-earth person until the end of the weekend her eyes tell everything when she gets into the car. No words required.     In the first hour we are introduced to the group of people who gather together for a shooting party in the countryside. This first hour is the best of the film Altman draws a breathtakingly accurate and detailed portrait of the worlds upstairs and especially downstairs where every gesture is right-on-target. I have not seen anything like this before. While the servants are preparing for the dinner, the others upstairs are sharpening their teeth on each other - it is a festival of one-liners (especially for Maggie Smith).  I sat down with great expectations and I can say this movie did not disappoint me. It is always good to see a great cast and director working at the highest level. The cinematography, the music and the art direction are first grade (this is the minimum in the case of a film like this one).  Finally, I cannot do anything but highly recommend this masterpiece to every movie-lover and for those who would like to see the mechanics of the class system. "},{"Title":"Sheer Class.

Scenes are shot as if the subject matter was framed within a painting, and something as simple as a dining room table was made breathtaking by Robert Altman's expert direction.**Possible Spoiler** 	 Gosford Park follows along the footsteps of `Upstairs/Downstairs' by simultaneously featuring the trials and tribulations of the wealthy and the servants who have to tend to the every need of the society upstairs. It quickly becomes very clear that there isn't a lot of distinction between the two classes other than their money and social standing &#150; even their servants are called by their `masters' names.  Taking place on a weekend in an English home in the countryside in 1932, an almost secondary plot point is the murder of the not-so-genial lord of the manor.  Among the many guests he is entertaining that weekend, there are several suspects.  I say this is all secondary because the main focus is the relationship between the upper and lower class.  While there are class distinctions even among the upper class, there are the same disparities among the servants as well, depending on their job and whom they serve.  While there are some stellar performances in the cast, which is basically a Who's Who of British actors, Maggie Smith is the definite standout.  While she quite obviously revels in her upper class status and is oblivious to the plight of those who serve her, she adds a hint of humanity to her character.  Additionally, she says so much with a simple eye roll that I found myself laughing several times due to her dry humor.  The real star of the film however, is the script.  In a film that sees virtually no action, I was kept interested by the amazing dialogue that was clever, profound and disturbing in its frankness.This film received many accolades for good reason.

The dividing line was strict and if you were going to cross it you had better not let yourself be caught.  This is the theme which runs through `Gosford Park'.  The big taboo is to be caught out of one's place on the other side.  Its OK to have sex with one of the other team but its not OK to be caught doing it.Its when Stephen Fry appears as Inspector Thompson that the modern outside world of 1932 intrudes.  Thompson appears to be a buffoon, a sort of Clouseau, who is almost completely ignored by both the upstairs and the downstairs teams because they, and he, could not work out which team he was on.  An Inspector has rank in the police force which places him above Constable Dexter who identifies quickly with the servants.  But the Inspector's rank does not grant him admission to the social circle above stairs.  He does not fit in and therefore is a nobody.  They did not even know his name or want to know what it was.

That having been said, I loved this film, and think it's one of the best Altman films. It's interesting that a murder mystery set in a British country house shares a lot with one of Altman's first movies, M*A*S*H, set in Korea in a different time all the comments above also apply to the early movie as well. In Gosford Park, it becomes clear that the plot's not the thing; if anything, it's a bit of a distraction. A group of relatives and friends - well, acquaintances, at any rate - gather in a for a weekend of shooting and socializing; somebody ends up dead, we find out whodunnit, everyone leaves. How common is that? But the point isn't the murder; it's, among other things, the tensions created by the class/caste system at that time, the hostility masked by the manners exhibited by the upper classes, the subtle (and not-so-subtle) insults and barbs thrown around, and (it seems to me) the constant tension created by an environment of huge disparities of income. Kind of like Dallas on any Sunday.Visually, the film is a complete treat; the cinematography is superb. Sonically, non-Altman fans (and myself) will complain that much of the dialogue is obscured and fragmented. This is completely deliberate; I got the DVD and turned on the subtitles and got quite a bit more out of the third viewing. But - and this is what makes both this (and M*A*S*H, and McCabe and Mrs. Miller) really a masterpiece - even though you don't get every word, suddenly you realize that you know exactly what's going on. Altman's ability to get this across to the audience in spite of the difficulty of understanding the details is what makes him a master.Finally, the one thing I really disliked about this movie is that, in the end, you realize that these people, all of them, really don't care for each other at all. Some of them hate each other, others just don't care for each other, but there's so little, or none, real affection shown in the movie that it's a bit absurd and mannered.High points every moment on screen with Helen Mirren in it. She just crackles. Recall that she and Michael Gambon were also in The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, with him playing a younger and louder version of the same role. Every moment that Jeremy Irons is singing, indeed, every moment he's onscreen. And of course, Maggie Smith, who just licks up her part like a purring, nasty, housecat lapping up cream; she steals every scene she's in and you know she knows it. Her comments to Ivor Novello (Jeremy Irons) What is it like, you know, when a movie just kind of flops? It must be so difficult so venomous, and delivered with such faux sympathy - defines her to at T.As I said, not everyone's poisoned cup of tea.

But this is not what makes the film intresting. It is the line up of characters we see, coming and going. The story is presenting us all kinds of people, a neurotic teenager, the typical american producer, the money-hungry son-in-law, the innocent maid or the dull inspector. They all add their pieces in the story wich makes it worthy of the nominations it recieved. I could not place any actor in front of the others saying he or she played very well. I would say that the casting was outstanding. They choose the right actors/actresses for the right parts, and this what made a solid ground of the film, on which the director could easily add on the tale. But what makes this film strong may weaken it also. There are just too many characters to keep track on, and it might seem to some, that when the movie is finished, they did not comprehend the storyline for full, instead lost in the maze of relations which the many characters have with each others. I want to recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good film, and foremost like a film that carries the classic style. It is also recommended for the wonderful scenery.

Like several others who have posted here, I ended up turning on the subtitles. I have had to use subtitles before with a few British films (Those with what I suppose to be 'lower class accents,' namely in Little Voice and The Full Monty. However, I have never previously used subtitles with Merchant Ivory films or others depicting the upper class.)  Strange. Anyway, I also agree that there were too many characters to keep straight.  Even at the end, I was trying to connect the names with the faces and sort out their relationships.  (Having the subtitles on probably made this worse as I was paying more attention to the words rather than what was shown on-screen.)  I disagree with those who have said that the mystery is not solved at the end...the 2 parties are accused and both are guilty!  I think I would have gotten even more out of this film if I would have viewed it again, but I don't have the patience to do that. Afterwards, we watched the Deleted Scenes with Altman's commentary on why they were deleted.  Time after time, Altman said that various scenes were deleted because they were not necessary to the plot, or that the point had been explained elsewhere.  I disagree.  With as many characters as there were, I think that reinforcing a few points would have made the film easier to follow.  Overall 7/10.  I am thinking about down-grading to a 6/10.

There are too many potentially interesting characters and their depiction becomes necessarily stereotypal and the story seems interminably long. Good performances don't help Altman's generalization that the wealthy and sophisticated can be just as dull and petty as the lower classes since we all know or should know that and films of this magnitude and budget should at least try to be entertaining.  The wit and cynicism that characterizes Altman's work when he strings together connecting vignettes, such as he did in Shortcuts, is missing here.

It's almost unanimously considered one of 2001's best movies. (I've read that if Altman kept his mouth shut during Oscar-voting season, he'd own one now). Set in 1930s England, it transpires over a weekend-long hunting party at a baronial country estate. The action is split between the high-society guests, and their servants. In true Agatha Christie fashion, someone is murdered, but the murder is not the heart of the movie. It's the characters themselves, and how they interact and relate with one another, formally and informally, servant and master. This movie is Grade A in every respect. It's an especially good choice for a rental on a 'family night' and everyone's sick to death of romantic comedies and cheap actioners.

They were both a little disappointing, although there were great performances. But I can assure you Altman is back with this British whodunit story, plenty of great British actors (Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Alan Bates, Hellen Mirren...) and also a few Americans like Jeremy Northam. Altman is known for his cast, there are always great actors in his films.He still is a great director, he was responsible for 'M*A*S*H' or 'Short Cuts'.  I was wondered what this Agatha Christie story would bring? Well like in the most films of Robert, there are a lot of characters and that makes it sometimes confusing. We have 2 groups of people in this film.(1) The servants, the butlers, the maids, the cooks... = the people from downstairs like Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, Alan Bates...(2) The countesses and people with a lot of money = the people from upstairs like Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott Thomas. So we get an upstairs, downstairs film, where the two classes are wonderfully shown to us.We have almost 15 characters in this film and you hardly know all their names. But grace to the director and screenwriter you can follow the film very good. There is also a guide in this story, Kelly Macdonald (the maid of Mrs. Trentham). Well you don't see clearly, but she is there in every important scene. Every character gets the time to show to the public, who they are, what they want. This kind of cinema is a good opportunity for the actors to give the best from themselves and you see that they enjoy it, but I give lather some more details about the performances of each actor.Now something about the story The shooting party in Gosford Park is always a great event; a lot of visitors come to enjoy the event together with their employees. But than suddenly Sir William (M. Gambon), the head of Gosford Park is killed and nearly everyone could do it and almost everyone has a motive. So detective Thompson (S. Fry) comes to look at the case. In this movie you have two things to follow;  - Who has murdered Sir William? - The evolution of each character.I choose the most important characters to follow, because follow every character is too difficult.Some words about the performances of the actorsMaggie Smith Harry Potter, Richard III, Death on the Nile, Sister Act... plays Countess Constant Trentham. She is one of the greatest leading actresses of England, and also one of the oldest. But she is great as snobistic countess. I am happy that in Europe the older actresses aren't forgotten like in Hollywood. Maggie is great and she is still acting wonderful. Her Academy Award nomination is totally deserved, she even deserved the Oscar.Kristin Scott Thomas Four Weddings and a Funeral, The English Patient plays Lady Sylvia the wife of Sir William. She is beautiful in this film, the perfect actress, in the perfect part. The scenes between Maggie & Kristin were the most beautiful of the movie.Helen Mirren Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (2002 - tv movie), The Madness of King George played one of the servants. One worth for here performance GREAT. She said in the movie, I have no life, because I am the perfect servant, well she also the perfect actress.Ryan Phillipe Cruel Intentions, Igby Goes Down, AntiTrust a great talent, wonderful performance and a great Scottish accent, he has nearly the same accent as Sean Connery. He played wonderful as Henry Denton, also a servant of an American guest.Alan Bates The Sum of all Fears, Far from the Madding Crowd played in his own, good style a very good butler, Jennings.  His performance was similar to these of Derek Jacobi.Other actors are E. Atkins, S. Fry, M. Gambom, E. Watson, J. Northam...This a great, I hope that `Voltage', the next film from Robert will be as good as this one or even better. He has again a great cast for that one; Joaquin Phoenix, Liv Tyler...Who murdered is the question, but don't forget that there is so much more to enjoy. Enjoy every moment of this is long movie (but one with quality).Thanks Robert for the fantastic 2 hours (and 17 minutes) of cinema pleasure.Rating 9/10 or ***1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"Gosford Park is one of the most misunderstood movies ever made.","Date":"20 July 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  I think everyone who sat down and watched Robert Altman's acclaimed film, Gosford Park, truly loved it... but just didn't understand it. I must admit that the first time around is the equivalent to chasing a psychotic horse down a rocky hill you can't quite keep up with the pace, and the action seems to be dropping rather than rising. You also can't follow the plot because you're too busy thinking, Who the heck is Mr. Blond? Though with 35 principal characters who are never formally introduced, this comes as no surprise. I first saw the movie when I bought it in conjunction with Ron Howard's Oscar-winning A Beautiful Mind on DVD (there was a $5 discount if the two were purchased simultaneously, and I am a well-known cheap-o) I had never seen it in theaters, and I was relying entirely on my instincts and the usually-unreliable critics. Even with the modern advent of closed captioning and the rewind button at my fingertip, I was rather confused throughout the film. When the credits started scrolling up the screen I was still craving more the finale seemed a bit unsatisfying and there were a lot of subplots I did not catch. So I put the DVD away and said to myself, I guess it was worth the $15. A few weeks later -- when I had nothing else to watch -- I grabbed the movie off the shelf and popped it back in my DVD player, hoping that this time it would make a bit more sense. Man, am I glad that I did! Immediately I began to understand why this defeated The Royal Tenenbaums and Memento for the Best Screenplay Academy Award. There are some fantastic lines and a lot of great, juicy dialogue. The jokes are so sublime it's no wonder most people never laughed throughout the course of the film! The characters gain much more depth when you can actually comprehend the events that unfold, rather than when you are trying to just remember their names. All actors and actresses give excellent performances, especially Maggie Smith and Kristin Scott Thomas in their Oscar-nominated roles. Altman is a genius director, and although many people despise his over-lapping dialogue techniques, I've grown rather fond of them. I loved the soundtrack and the cinematography of the English country-side, both of which deserved statuettes. After Lord of the Rings, Memento, A Beautiful Mind, and The Royal Tenenbaums, Gosford Park is one of my favorite films of 2001. So for those of you who watched it and hated it, rent it again and pay close attention... you're bound to enjoy it.Overall rating 10/10 "}{"Title":"I didn't like it","Date":"16 July 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  The cast is a who's who of Brit actors I find mostly unwatchable -- Kristin Scott Thomas, Emily Watson, Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi -- plus a couple of dull American ones for good measure.

Can their servants have been quite so smart, sensible, and superior to their employers? I doubt it. I fancy the upper classes of that time were fairly erudite and educated, though of course there were some fools and freeloaders, as there were--and are--at every level of society. Nevertheless it was an absorbing and amusing movie--no plot to speak of, no denouement, more like a Dagwood sandwich--mustard on the bottom, mayonnaise on the top, slices of ham, pickles, ripe (very ripe) tomatoes, cheeses, baloney, and lettuce (as in, not enough). It was seasoned nicely with humor, irony, pathos, naughtiness, and passion.I suspect the mechanics of servicing a large house party were portrayed accurately; these scenes rang true, and were quite fascinating in fact. Some of the direction was nothing short of amazing. The shot of the lone butler holding an umbrella at the end of the opening scene--that was a small story in itself. And wasn't it brilliant how the second car just slid into view from around a curve and refocused your attention elsewhere. In fact this sort of thing kept happening throughout the film--you'd be following a line of thought, only to have it nudged away by another.Some would not care for this kind of disjointed story, but I found I could tolerate it quite well. The cinematography was excellent. The actors were well-cast and really superb. I recognized the lovely Kelly MacDonald not so much by her face as by her lyrical Scottish burr, which was so arresting in My Life So Far.This could have been a great film had the social viewpoint been more balanced and realistic, but then perhaps ridiculing Western culture was the whole point--I don't know enough about the writers and director to say.I would recommend this to persons who delight in nuance and subtlety.

(If you can't find it, look for it on the Bravo channel.)  Then, compare/contrast that film to/with Altman's movie.Uh, seriously folks, ever since Nashville (1975), Altman has been coasting.  If someone had just told him then, that, for the sake of the listening audience (except for those watching at home with the benefit of subtitles), it helps if the actors take turns talking--one at a time--perhaps we would have been spared more than a quarter-century of auditory confusion, to say nothing of having to turn the volume all the way up to distinguish the half-dozen English/American/Scottish dialects that assault you from every direction, and in competition with background noise, as you must in this movie.  Really, what was originally a clever convention is now an annoying and unnecessary contrivance.And then there is the small matter of the story.  Nashville convinced Altman that he could film a succession of scenes, most of them disconnected, and he would have a story.  The next year (1976), Altman rolled out Buffalo Bill & the Indians, really one of the worst movies EVER made, and yet a few critics raved about it, evidently convincing Altman that he had found THE formula.  There is a tiny story hidden away in Gosford Park, but it does not emerge until the last twenty minutes.It's not that Gosford Park is a bad film, it isn't.  Instead, it's an ordinary film.  Nothing exceptional.  The actors?  Sure, they're talented, but they weren't challenged in this movie.  This is not Shakespeare. And the costumes?  They hardly make a film.  Check out Buffalo Bill's and Annie Oakley's duds in the 1976 film.I had a slight problem with the setting--1932.  It would have been better had the story been set in 1922 or, better, in 1912 (see The Shooting Party).  By 1932, Britain was in the middle of the worldwide depression (it was not just an American phenomenon), and the lifestyle depicted in Gosford Park had essentially disappeared (although obviously not the class distinctions).  This is a minor nitpick.I do think Altman had trouble deciding whether he was making Murder by Death, Clue, Upstairs, Downstairs, or the extraordinary The Shooting Party.  It contains elements of all four.  There wasn't a single scene in the movie that was not derivative of some other movie or television series. There have been so many truly excellent British productions in the last ten or 15 years, but this wasn't one of them.  It's an expensively produced melodrama that is nice to look at, but it took too long to tell, and has almost nothing else going for it.  See The Shooting Party.

Juggling a huge cast and multilayered story with the visual requirements of the era the movie is set in. Most films, especially today, follow an disappointingly narrow, linear path. Everything that characters say or do in them is in the service of the plot and arrival at wherever it is that the movie is supposed to arrive. Well, this is not how Altman makes movies. His characters are real multifaceted personalities, they don't spew lines simply because that is what's required to move the plot along. Watching this movie I felt like I was invited to this 1930s English lavish estate. Altman took his time to introduce me to these fascinating characters, their quirks and insecurities. He showed me around this house and in doing so gave me plenty of insight into this era and it's people.

This is just a dramatic setting for Altman to work his magic and one aspect of this film, but  there's so much more to it.

I feel cheated!In my own opinion, anyone who actually thinks this film is worth any humans time has more than one screw loose.As i said before, this film lasts approximately 130 minutes. The whole thing could have been summarised and produced as a short (30 minute) film and still had as much impact on the viewers, infact, probably alot more. They would have been glad it was over so quickly.I have watched alot of films.. some good, some bad, some really bad. But this is the original TERRIBLE moive.

Living in England, one is dished up a glamorized version of the Victorian golden era, but it is rare to hear critical comments about this period.  Even today, the films produced about this era deal with the upper classes playing their little games or solving yet another silly murder.Gosford Park is a movie that debunks and de-glamorizes the Victorian era. Although the surface image of this era may be glamorous due to the opulent setting and the sophistication of its characters, the film reveals the upper classes as a shallow, snobbish and mean spirited bunch.  The aristocrats barely tolerate each other, and their meetings have a lot to do with obtaining allowances from the wealthy factory owner who grudgingly subsidized the lot.  This time the tolerance gives way to outright hostility because the industrialist refuses to distribute allowances that were forthcoming in the past.    Once the economic relationship is brought into question, the false gentility gives way to a bare disdain.What sets the film apart is that it is also willing to explore the people who are usually in the background in other films.  The butlers and the maids also have a story, one often intertwined with that of their masters.  At Gosford Park all the servants lose their identity - they are not referred to by their own names, but are referred to as `servant to X'.  Not only is their identity erased, but also more pernicious aspects of the abuse of power become evident.  Yet another myth of this most prudish of eras is debunked and it pertains to sexual exploitation.  It is clear from the film that the alternative to working at this ghastly house is abject poverty, and thus there was little alternative to what amounted to prostitution.The film culminates with the murder of the industrialist - and it reveals that everyone has an ax to grind.  Below the veneer of upper class gentility resides an egoistic and shallow bunch of people with little regard for others.  The servants are victims of their circumstances, but some of them are perhaps willing participants.Gosford Park does us all a favor by demolishing the glamorized history of the time.  It is time to take the good bits of history, and safely jettison and question the remainder.  This film will make you think twice before going to the next Victorian period film that pops up.

It's an insightful foray into the human condition, filled with pettiness, indiscretion, passion and lust, dignity (as well as lack thereof), an aloof disregard for our fellow man, and finally, even love; all of the things that make life-- well, if not worth living-- just `life,' by definition.  It's all found in `Gosford Park,' during one particularly eventful weekend, from which Altman manages to paint a vivid and realistic portrait that is a telling study of what it is that makes the world go &#145;round. 	It's 1932 England, and a select group of those from the upper crust of society have gathered at the country estate of Sir William and Lady Sylvia McCordle (Michael Gambon and Kristin Scott Thomas) for a weekend shooting party.  But it's a weekend that will find the guests engaging in a variety of `sports,' the least of which has to do with the shooting of birds, and will ultimately involve the untimely demise of one of those present.  Yes, murder is afoot among the privileged and those who serve them, and there are suspects and motives aplenty.  And though it's a dreadful affair, it causes seemingly little consternation among the friends and family of the deceased, and at the same time affords at least one guest, Mr. Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), with a unique opportunity.  Weissman is a Hollywood movie producer, in attendance at this extended soiree for the purpose of researching his next project, `Charlie Chan in London,' a murder mystery that takes place at a country estate.  So it appears that this may become a case of art imitating life.  First, however, the dust will have to settle and it will all have to be sorted out; and we find that before it's over, that can be a murky business, indeed.  But such is life among the aristocracy, among whom even murder can be taken in stride-- and life goes on.  	Altman's film makes a subtle, yet powerful statement about what compels the human animal and serves as the impetus of his actions.  Written by Julian Fellowes (from an idea by Altman and Bob Balaban), the film sagely explores the cross purposes inherent in the convergence of individual agendas and needs, and the conflicts they must, therefore, naturally inspire.  Altman's characters are extremely well developed, and presented in such a way that the audience is able to keep track of who is who and where the many and myriad pieces of the puzzle fit together, though they are numerous and involve a number of storylines and subplots.  As he is wont to do, Altman keeps you emotionally somewhat at arm's length, yet still involved, setting a deliberate pace that will make you oblivious of the time it takes him to tell his story (137 minutes).  The contrasts he draws between the classes, and even the diverse personalities of those within them, are incisive; and in that distinction we learn so very much about who we really are and what makes us tick.  The oppressively dry and reserved British bearing and atmosphere that permeates every frame of the film suits Altman's stoic style exceptionally well, and he displays such an eye for detail, from everything that happens visually, to the little snippets of peripheral dialogue and the rendering of all the human flaws and imperfections that make it so real, that this just may be his most perfect film yet.	As can be expected from such an inspired cast, the performances that drive this film are second to none; but the fact that he was able to sustain such consistent quality and excellence from his actors-- considering the size of his cast alone-- is quite a feat, for which Altman deserves another nod of acknowledgement.  There are a number of outstanding performances here that deserve to be singled out, but the most memorable are turned in by Helen Mirren, who is extremely affecting as Mrs. Wilson, the housekeeper with a dark secret; Kelly Macdonald, as Mary, the new maid struggling to learn the ropes of service and the ways of the very rich; Emily Watson, as Elsie, the Head Housemaid whose entanglements lead her into murky waters; Sophie Thompson, as Dorothy, the Still Room Maid (Thompson is arguably one of the best character actors around, as she demonstrates here); and Maggie Smith, as Constance, the Countess of Trentham, turning in a performance that is the definitive portrayal of privilege.  Also noteworthy are Gambon, Kristin Scott Thomas (who is absolutely elegant) and Ryan Phillippe, as Mr. Weissman's man, Henry Denton.	Rounding out this superb cast are Alan Bates (Jennings), Jeremy Northam (Novello), Camilla Rutherford (Isobel), Charles Dance (Lord Stockbridge), Geraldine Somerville (Lady Stockbridge), Eileen Atkins (Mrs. Croft), Derek Jacobi (Probert), Richard E. Grant (George), Clive Owen (Robert Parks) and Stephen Fry (Inspector Thompson).  A transporting film that captures a time and place that now belongs to the ages, `Gosford Park' establishes the realization that environments and those who populate them are ever changing-- and yet they stay inexplicably the same; it's the nature of who we are and how we thrive, for better or worse.  And it's that essence that Robert Altman captures so succinctly here.  This is riveting, entertaining drama that teaches us something, if only we are willing to listen; and even the best of us would be well served to do just that.  By seeing the way things are, perhaps it will give us pause to reflect upon the way things `should' be.  Perhaps it is possible to create a world in which the `Upstairs, Downstairs' mentality is no longer viable; a world in which all men are viewed as equal.  It may be concealed within the context, but it's a question Altman nevertheless effectively asks with this film.  That's the power of the cinema-- and it's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.

When it is surrounded by big sloppy and grandiose pictures and is given plenty of time to disappear from critics memories and subsequent top ten lists, would it still be remembered come Oscar time or even Golden Globe time?  I ask this because I saw this film last Wednesday, five days before the Golden Globes were awarded and when I walked out I was aghast at how lame of a film this was, how truly boring the film really is.  Then I am watching the G.G's and not only is the film nominated in categories it has no business being nominated in, but Altman wins for best director.  I says pardon?  But to be fair, not that most of the other films that are being heralded this year as Oscar front runners are much better ( with the exception of Lord of the Rings) but to include Gosford Park on a short list of films that are the best the year 2001 has to offer is quite appalling. I am not going to bore you with plot devices or names of people in the film or the character's they play because let's face it, you could seriously be here until tomorrow trying to make sense of it all.  If you want a glowing positive review about the film and a review which tries to make sense of it all, go to www.chicagosuntimes.com/Ebert and then type in Gosford Park.  The venerable old film critic loved it and has dissected the film for all of those who may want to know everything there is to know about the characters.Gosford Park takes place in jolly old crusty, parvenu England in the 1930's.  Many of England's aristocratic population have been invited to a rich guy's house for a hunting party for the weekend.  Here the guests worry more about who they are sitting beside and what they are going to wear than they do about the well being of one another nor do they really offer any sort of friendly allegiance to any one particular person.  Everyone just seems to go because if they don't then they would be missing the social event of the year.  This is where all of the gossip takes place and perhaps business is talked about in it's infant stages.  Most of the people on the upper level are boring old bats that lead sheltered lives and have no idea how the rest of the world lives.  They may wipe their behinds with gold-laced tissue but they probably couldn't tell you what the capital of Greece is.  Their lives are protected by the bubble of naivete that most of them live in.  The only lives I was somewhat interested in were that of the American movie producer, the movie star and their Scottish valet.  Of course, there is a secret that this vallet has and if you can't figure it out in the first ten minutes of the film then you haven't seen enough movies.  The valet is played by Ryan Phillipe and to me, he has turned into quite an impressive performer.  I enjoy him in almost everything he is in and this is probably his most complete performance since Cruel Intentions.  Downstairs you have the proletariat, the humble servants.  And while their lives seem to be slightly more intriguing than those that they serve, I still wasn't swayed.  Upstairs and downstairs people gab and chatter and talk and converse but more times than not it really amounts to much a do about nothing.  I realize that all of this bantering about is supposed to set up the murder of one of the rich guys.  But with this much going on in the house, both up and down, you tend to lose site of the facts.  Okay, was this maid sleeping with this rich guy or was this butler really that bitter towards that employer and so on.  By the time the murder does take place, I was almost asleep.  And there lies the problem.Boredom.I really was bored with all that was happening.  I didn't really care for the snobbishness of the upper echelon nor was I intrigued with the tenderness and sweetness of the lower class citizens.  And finally when someone gets a knife in the chest about six hours into the film, I was ready to exclaim haleluaaaaa!!!.  Things do get a little interesting when the inspector arrives on the scene.  He seems like Keystone cop, John Cleese like from a Fish Called Wanda.  He is dull, not very careful with what he touches and amusingly overlooks obvious clues.  His deputy seems much more in touch with what is happening than he ever chooses to be and this adds some much needed comic relief.Gosford Park is just another in the long list of over-hyped late season films that are really just disappointments.  The list includes but is does not end with Beautiful Mind, The Majestic, Ali and even The Royal Tenenbaums disappointed me a bit.This has not been a banner year for films and Gosford Park takes it's rightful and deserving place as one of the bigger disappointments and one of the weaker films I have seen thus far this year.5 out of 10- This is only rated this high because I enjoyed Phillipe and I have to give credit to the editor of the film who must have had hours of work ahead of him and did quite an admirable job.

We hear snatches of conversation, offhanded remarks; we see gowns that don't quite fit, impolite glances, tics of boredom; we move from bedroom to bathroom, scullery to dining room. There are the usual boundaries defining the roles and places -- upstairs and downstairs, master and servant, English and American, wife and husband, but the borders are all dotted lines, permeable, and as roles become transparent and places overlap there develops an underlying connection and duplication between upstairs and downstairs servants overhear guests' gossip and relay it in confidence to their masters; masters confide in servants; servants and guests engage in trysts, servants and guests use aliases -- in fact, to help the house operate smoothly, the servants must take on their masters' last names during their stay. Doors open and panels close; at any moment a servant can be in the midst of guests criticizing another guest's clothes or a guest can be in the kitchen stealing a taste of jam.The audience, moving through and along with the ordinary events of meals and outings, becomes simultaneously a participant and an impartial witness in a world where everyone is playing a social role and a private role and -- for Altman and us -- a cinematic whodunnit role. None of the characters stand out as more or less likeable or suspicious than any other, and the possibility is always present that everyone is not who they really are or staying within the boundaries, with the result that they are always 'acting' while 'enacting'-- on several levels at once. Even the ordinary props -- photographs, hunting rifles, bottles of toxic household cleaners, kitchen knives -- have this possibility, as does, ultimately, Altman's creation. All this brings an 'edge' to the procedings, an expectation that something odd may happen in this hackneyed world, a simultaneous sense of safety and danger. Set in the predictable machinery of a whodunnit (a usual murder with the usual suspects rounded up in the drawingroom for questioning by the usual bungling detective) we're left guessing and involved but detatched and feeling like we've seen all this before this is after all a cliche (in fact the American tells the English guests that he's a Hollywood producer who makes Charlie Chan whodunnit movies) but we can engage or not (the English guests tell the American they'll probably never see his films).That we can see, or not, while being aware of the reasons why or why not, and that we can know or not know while being conscious of how -- this is what makes this film so dramatically engaging and intellectually brilliant, a subtlety that works on many levels and an icon that will stand the test of time.

Each character lives in each word they say, which is fortunate because, with this large ensemble, no one gets a great deal of screen time. Perfectly cast and artfully directed. Altman's camera meanders through the huge English mansion, pausing on bottle of poison, tables full of knives, and cases of guns to foreshadow the inevitable foul play. The conclusion (and the revelation of the culprit) come along so smoothly that, when they both arrive, one is left with that satisfying combination of surprise and inevitability. Well, of course that's what happened. I should have known all along. By the way, don't worry if the you get a little lost in the flurry of characters and stories that get introduced in the beginning.

Nobody could be removed without altering the uniquely organic fabric Altman weaves between the different classes, genders, and families. The intricate, dense screenplay by Julian Fellowes provides a clean and precise roadmap and disciplines Altman's improvisatory technique to follow stricter period guidelines. However, the passion, intensity, and spontaneity are still very much there. And there's Altman himself - directing with astounding fluidity, agility, wicked humor, incisiveness...but above all deep compassion. A masterwork.

Probably just as well as Altman's latest doesn't run the risk of winning any. It's a disappointment to see the man who gave us Short Cuts, possibly the greatest film of the 1990s, come up with a string of turkeys. Gosford Park is the fourth installment in what one had hoped would have remained just a trilogy of rotten eggs (pret a porter, cookie's fortune and Dr. T) On the face of it all we have all the ingredients to make a great film a fabulous cast too long to list playing the aristocrats and their servants, superb period setting in the 1930s, in the gap between the two word wars. The themes are endless class struggle within the microcosm of an grand and isolated country estate; a once-fearsome naval power losing its grip on its empire and desperately holding on to its fusty traditions; America, the teething threat across the waters, embarking on its cultural invasion of Europe. Alas, what Altman gives us is a shallow Upstairs-Downstairs scenario laden with cut out cardboard characters. To make sense of these shallow and uninteresting people he gives us a hackneyed and pointless murder mystery plot, which even Agatha Christie would have disowned. The danger of bringing together over twenty actors, all used to being protagonists, is that you fail to flesh them out and allocate each of them a time slot to taken centre stage and shine. It was a trap Altman ingeniously didn't fall into in both Nashville and Shortcuts, when he solicited understated yet compelling performances from every single of his vast ensemble cast. His genius was to weave the intricate strands of the story into a coherent and gripping mosaic of people and their environment, combining humor with human tragedy. What can I say, Kristin Scott Thomas is utterly wasted. Charles Dance barely gets a word in. Maggie Smith is a painful caricature, but a mildly amusing one at that. Helen Mirren, Clive Owen and Emily Watson, playing someone who isn't hysterical and neurotic for a change, redeem themselves. They're all far too good to be playing bit players.

I fall into the former category. Gosford Park is a slow-paced but wryly perceptive examination of British classes in the early 1930s. Think of it as Upstairs, Downstairs as viewed through a microscope. The huge cast is difficult to identify upon first encounter, just because of the sheer number of worthy characters who share screen time. So effective is the acting that each of the personae seems to have a back history. This may cause momentary confusion, as you wonder why he or she is behaving in such an inexplicable manner. But it also fleshes them out and makes them appear to be real human beings, rather than conduits of stereotypical posturing. The story line is convoluted in the extreme, perfect for such a murder mystery. I put that in quotes because homicide is only an excuse for screenwriter Julian Fellowes, director Robert Altman, and a brilliant contingent of actors to provide some of the most captivating dialogue and characterization that you are likely to see in any film anywhere. (Personally, I fell in love with Kelly Macdonald.) By all means, invest your money in Gosford Park. You will not be disappointed, unless of course mindless action is your thing.

Many people that I've talked with about Gosford Park have said they disliked it because as a whodunit, it's really awful. Well, okay. But I think that Altman doesn't really care about the whodunit as the point, but rather as just a vehicle to expose the inner workings of the manor. It's really more of a whydunit--what motivates the characters and why they do what they do.If you like the film reasonably well, WATCH THE WRITER'S COMMENTARY! Not the director's, which is okay. The writer's commentary is fascinating. The writer talks about how life works in the English upper crust and in the servant's lives downstairs. Hearing details about how the upper classes of England try to be as rude as possible within the limits of the rules of etiquette is fascinating. It's full of observations like that.

For a comedy/crime/drama/mystery there isn't much comedy, crime, drama or mystery. Most of the characters seem like cardboard cut-outs they aren't given any depth whatsoever. This isn't the fault of the actors but of the script (and the over abundance of uninteresting characters). This would be forgivable if Gosford Park was entertaining (ie. funny or mysterious), but it's not.I think the main problem with Gosford Park is that nothing happens. The acting is fine, the directing is fine, ... but nothing happens. The characters have no arcs they interact, but virtually none of them change during the course of the movie. They don't even face any personal conflicts. In fact, the movie as a whole lacks conflict.As a crime/mystery, Gosford Park could have worked. Even if the characters weren't very deep or interesting (and don't change), a surprising twist and some good dramatic scenes could have made a pretty good movie, but Robert Altman doesn't even try.Perhaps the point of Gosford Park was to be a realistic period piece with a wide variety of different characters (who sometimes talk over the top of each other!

A little bit Agetha Christie, but not really, the story of a dismal weekend in the country is made all the better by Altman's direction, or his ability to direct without interference in his actor's performances.Stellar performances include Maggie Smith (Prime of Miss Jean Brody), delightful as the Countess without a pot to p*#s in, Michael Gambon (The Singing Detective), the victim of greedy in-laws and dog-haters, Jeremy Northam as Ivor Novello delivers blissful musical entertainment to guests and audience alike, Emily Watson (Metroland) demonstrates why she is one of the best young actors working today, and the wonderful Helen Mirren and sexy Clive Owen are mysterious players in the upstairs-downstairs dilemma. The depth of cast talent is akin to an archaeology dig, it just keeps getting better as time passes.Gosford Park is a film that makes film watching a pleasure.

I'd seen many of the year's movies but somehow had never got around to seeing Gosford Park. The snippets and previews made it look so intriguing I decided I would see it quite soon which I then did not do. My loss because I finally saw it recently and have to say this movie is really good.I have read many of the negative comments and actually many people I know have seen it and not enjoyed it. I can actually understand the negatives and will freely admit, that at times, this is a tough movie to just relax and enjoy. You have to constantly be on alert-the amount of main characters in Gosford Park, is so expansive, I can't imagine anyone NOT having a hard time remembering names or even who is who. I struggled with all of that as well as with the incredible talky dialog-something that I usually like but that in this movie, was taken to such extremes it was difficult to make out a lot of what was said. If this review is sounding negative I don't mean it to. But, there's no doubt that it can be understood why somebody would have a hard time with this or even turn it off in midstream.For me, I was having such a hard time following what was going on that I finally gave up and just figured I'd relax and try to enjoy what I could actually understand. And once I did that, I started liking this movie a lot more. Part of the reason is because the movie contains so many interesting things going on, it's inevitable that something will make one take notice. It's really not a movie I could tune out or turn off. And though the confusion is present throughout the film, the story is such an interesting one I'm glad I gave it a chance and saw it through.Many have commented the murder wasn't the focus of the film and that is true. It doesn't even happen to well more then halfway through. But the who done it aspect is still there to some degree. This movie combines many different things- a scorching, almost satirical and mischievous drama on social class-with a multi character study with an Agatha Christie like mystery. It is throughly confusing, at times very frustrating, amazingly talky, and sometimes a bit muddled. And yet it is also intriguingly beautiful and brilliantly made. It maybe that if one can't like it, they can certainly admire it and though it had many a strange and challenging moment I'm not one who thinks a movie has to be enjoyable all through to still be an excellent movie. This wouldn't, by any means, make it into my top ten, not even my top 100, but I maybe admire it a bit more then many movies that would be on that list.I wont even bother to single out any particular performance as all were great and the photography, direction etc were all great as many have said but there are not a lot of comments on the musical score. Simply fabulous, that's what got me in the first few seconds of the movie. The musical score fits so well-it's got that same almost indescribable element as the movie and that's important because music can be so important to a movie. This is one of the best movie scores I've ever heard.Gosford Park is a movie that almost begs to be seen twice. I plan to, personally I don't think this is a movie that can be full enjoyed the first time around. I freely admit I still can't remember over half the names of the characters. Or who said what. And who they said it to. Maybe I still won't after seeing it again but you never know. An impressive movie and my vote's 8 of 10.

I didn't see 'Gosford Park' when it was released and have only now purchased the dvd on a bet because  I have liked Altman in the past and this flick had a very interesting cast. It is a genre picture akin to 'Murder on the Orient Express' (though not as efficiently scripted) and every Merchant/Ivory production I've seen.  This is a derivative, busy and empty film.  The cast is wasted but some of them still entertain and lift the general level of boredom a tad higher during brief moments, as in one of the last scenes with Helen Mirren and Eileen Atkins which is a moving moment.  There are some good lines here and there and the cast is always interesting to watch.  The house is the most interesting part of this movie.The most glaring problem with 'Gosford Park' is that there are just too many characters whose function in the storyline is nil.  The plot is very basic, there are no twists or turns, contrary to great Agatha Christie stories and others, and the countless side plots are too prominant and only confuse the situation.  The corker is that at the end of this mess I still wasn't sure who actually committed the murder.Altman is too clever by half, or perhaps half as clever as he really needed to be.  The dvd contains the scenes excised from the finished product and they only add questions to my way of thinking.  Facets of characters are revealed in those lost scenes but only add confusion as to who they are and what they are up to.  The finished product is a hairball of loose ends.  In the narrated portion of the out-takes Altman seems very smug and proud of this half-baked effort.  The script won an Oscar which is incomprehensible to me, unless the competition that year was even more scrappy than this effort.Altman has tried to interpret a society that he has no understanding of or sympathy for. He has interpreted the early days of this century in a great house in England through his clich√©d eyeballs.  The rich are bad, the poor are good, the poor gets his revenge by stabbing the corpse of the Lord in the heart and then gets away with it, I assume, since the movie doesn't get as far as an actual trial.  The Inspector, played by Stephen Fry, is a complete waste of time.  It makes no sense to have him come in at all.  He does not find the killer and is totally unbelieveable as a bumbling Clouseau-cum-Poirot idiot.The only top drawer performances are from the aforementioned Mirren and Atkins and a couple of young actresses, Sophie Thompson and Kelly MacDonald.  Maggie Smith is Maggie Smith and she's fun, as usual, and lifts the energy up greatly in her scenes.  All the men are bores and have no character.  Charles Dance and James Wilby, both favorite actors, drift around ranting, noses in the air.The basic premise of this movie would never have gotten it past the producers had it not been Altman's project.  This turkey is a bomb but it is pleasant to look at and harmless, but what a waste of money, talent and time.

There were so many characters that some were reduced to irrelevancies, and the dramatic centre of the movie was disappointingly limp and long in coming.  It's almost as if the murder were an irritating distraction that got in the way of - rather than revealed - the characters' idiosyncrasies.   The character stuff is entertaining, but as I said, there are too many of them, and if a film is intent on capturing my attention for two and a half hours then it must act as if the tension is integral to developments, rather than merely being an insubstantial in-joke for the audience's amusement.If you like character studies then I think you'll find the murder gets in the way, and if you like murder mysteries then much of the interaction only serves to confuse rather than inform.

The Altman work this has the closest affinity with is A Wedding, a strong but messy film during which you feel that a number of sub-plots and minor characters have been largely lost in the cutting room. No such problem here. The mastery of the director is everywhere evident, and the screenplay by Julian Fellowes, based on an idea by Altman and Bob Balaban, provides a rock-solid structure. Clearly there are several genres and influences in play in Gosford Park the Agatha Christie-style murder mystery, shading ever so slightly into Clue-land; the Jean Renoir country weekend in The Rules of the Game; the classic British television series Upstairs Downstairs (this last debt is underlined by the fact that the Gosford Park cast includes Meg Wynn Owen, who played Hazel in Upstairs Downstairs, and Eileen Atkins, who co-created the series with Jean Marsh). The cinematic style is utterly fluid, and the rooms and halls of the great house (an actual noble estate) are as palpable to us as if we were guests.There are too many fine actors in Gosford Park to single out all of them, although one must mention the foxiness of Clive Owen (headed toward major stardom, believe me); the gravity of Helen Mirren; the inevitable perfection of Maggie Smith in a role that seems tailored for her; the brittle aristocracy of Kristin Scott Thomas; the severity of Charles Dance; the furtive appeal of Ryan Philippe; the solid masculine charm of Jeremy Northam (and who knew he could sing?); the skunkiness of James Wilby; the hauteur of Richard E.

(Nashville, Short Cuts, 3 Women, A Wedding, The Player, to name a few) -- the 90's brought about a revitalized creative energy from the great American director, after the downward spiral of his 80's output.  Granted, the 90's brought about a fair number of misses (Kansas City, Pret A Porter, Dr. T. and The Women), as well.  However, the heights reached by Short Cuts and The Player dwarf like a Mt.

Much like the impression I had after my first visit to London to witness the starry hullabaloo of the West End theatrical scene -- seven highly-acclaimed plays, in seven cramped to dilapidated theaters, in a whirlwind four days -- my posterior felt numb and I couldn't help but feel that the critics must've seen a different version than the one I just witnessed.  (At least in the live theater outings, the plays came with intermissions and a bar.)  Gosford Park (sans intermission and spirits) was a complete and utter bore -- much like the boars that inhabited the film's wafer-thin scenario!  How arbitrary and lame was that whole third-rate Agatha Christie-like thread!  Oh, you might say, Ahhh, but the acting!  Like the world-weary upstairs characters, I was unimpressed by what can best be described as competent -- retreads of far superior characters in far superior stories/films.  Yes, those English actors sure have their bored airs down pat!  Gosford Park, my fellow filmgoers, is ultimately an expensive-looking, high-minded (read snooty), far-less amusing, far-less intriguing version of any number of Agatha Christie filmed novels, including sorely underappreciated Murder Under The Sun.  If someone says that I'm missing the point, that the film is more a study of the classes and less about the murder and subsequent investigation, then I reply by saying  Give me original characters worth studying! Give me original characters that I can care about!  Give me ANYTHING original! Murder By Death anyone???

In actual fact it is the tale of a group of men larking about, playing pranks upon each other without ever threatening to be funny.In The Long Goodbye Altman thought it would be a great idea to transform Philip Marlowe from a wisecracking, smart-arse, world-weary detective into a lazy, uncouth tramp played by the woefully miscast Elliott Gould.Popeye is universally recognised as being terrible.The Player is seen as a witty, incisive yet cynical view of Hollywood to this viewer it was nothing more than a long protracted bore.Which brings us onto Gosford Park...Again we see Altman indulging in his belief that having a variety of characters all talking at once so you can't hear a word is art.But this is Robert Altman we are talking about here, the man who deflects criticism of his films by stating with astonishing arrogance that they are all marvellous, a director who clearly does not know art from his elbow.This alone (if you are generous enough to forget the poor quality of his films) should make it obvious that he is no great amongst the cinema world. How many of the truly great filmmakers often felt dissatisfied with their work always feeling that there was at least one aspect that should have been improved upon? The answer is the vast majority of them if not all as it was this along with their talent that enabled them to consistently produce work of such a high order.In the documentary about the making of this film he talks about what a maverick he is. Often he would do a scene and feel totally satisfied with the result and prepare to move on only to be reminded by the script girl that key elements of the scene have been completed missed out. To approach a scene in this manner with total disregard for its content is sheer stupidity. Either this is the truth and he is a fool or it is another feeble attempt to fuel the insane belief that he is one of the last great mavericks.Nonetheless I looked forward to seeing Gosford Park on the strength of its reviews remembering that many of these critics often ridicule his other films so I felt that they were not among the morons that praise Altman's work simply because his name appears in the credits.What started as an intriguing opening with the impression of a real event about to unfold simply went on... and on... AND ON...For an hour, yes AN HOUR, Altman 'set the scene', focussing on one unattractive character after another involved in utterly banal actions that were of no interest and of no relevance to the story. He just wanted us to get to know everyone.How nice.Then it happened, the murder.This was the cue for a whole string of revelations about most of the cast (surely so many in such a short space of time is far too much of a coincidence) that yet again were of no relevance at all. Some servant was actually an actor preparing for a role (who cares?). The butler (played by the once great Alan Bates who sadly stopped acting after 'A Day in the Death of Joe Egg' and decided to devote his talent to playing dotty Englishman) having been a conscientious objector years earlier.These are all items aimed at maintaining the interest in a film that could quite easily have been cut down to an hour and nothing would have appeared to be missing.Then we find out who the murderer might be and its over. The credits role.A terrible film.I saw Gosford Park a few months ago but was only moved to write about it when I saw earlier today that the latest version of the Halliwell Film Guide made it the first film for two years to get the maximum four star rating.Astonishing.The first film since another criminally over rated flick American Beauty to be hailed as a milestone in cinema history.Arguably the most accurate and reliable film guide is becoming far too lenient whilst Robert Altman is riding the crest of a wave.What a sad time it is.This truly abominable film and the accompanying documentary confirmed my view of Altman as one of the worst filmmakers and one of the most conceited men associated with cinema.The man is getting on in years, thankfully he won't be able to do many more films but the next time he makes a film that attracts the attention that Gosford Park did I fear there is a real chance of him being given the Oscar for it.The Academy will say amongst themselves 'Lets give him the award, he's going to die soon'There is only one Academy where Altman's films should be sweeping the board.

We feel as though we're intruding on the guests assembled for a weekend in Gosford Park in the England of the 30s. The Altman technique of having characters talk at the same time works very well here. We're like eavesdroppers to all the conversations taking place in the different rooms. We can peek at how the upper classes behave in their natural habitat, as well as how the servants revolve around theirs.There is not a false note in this film. It involves us thoroughly, as is the case with other Altman pictures. We're afraid not to pay attention, thus missing a bit of dialogue. We are like eavesdroppers on the other side of the screen savoring the antics of the rich and famous.Maggie Smith is brilliant as the impoverish noblewoman that is going through bad times. Michael Gambon strikes the right note with his portrayal of the head of Gosford Park, as does Kristin Scott-Thomas, as his wife.It was very good to see Alan Bates as the butler. Helen Mirren is incredible as the head of the staff, always in the background, in her thankless job. What a pleasure to see Kelly McDonald, Clive Owens, Derek Jacobi, Eileen Atkins and Emily Watson. They are the devoted servants who keep this household going.

Director Robert Altman once again takes the Hollywood formula and gives a unique twist. The story begins when aristocrats during 1932 gather at Sir William McCordle's (Michael Gambon) estate for a shooting party. The guests are wealthy people with their trusty servants. People arrive at the McCordle estate two by two and the traditions begin. The servants set up dinner for their masters and the aristocrats begin their personal routines.The story moves on as the characters begin to establish their names and the audience learns their varying social status. The intertwining stories among the guests begin to surface and the audience begins to realize there is much more in this house than what meets the eye.During the night one member of the elite group is killed. None of the guests seemed to be fazed by this event and are only upset by the inconvenience it sets up for their lives.The only one troubled is Constance, Countess of Trentham's maid, Mary (Kelly McDonald). The story begins to focus on Mary, who discovers secrets among the visitors and leads the audience to solve the mystery.The great aspect about this film is Robert Altman's abilities to bring the past to life. He pays excellent attention to detail and is able to recreate the feelings and morals during the time period. He emerges the audience into a film world filled with history and story. Throughout the film Altman visually shows the audience the contrast between social classes through his various shots, lighting techniques, and camera filters. His fluid camera movements visually portray foreshadowing and relationship among characters. These elements give the audience a complete understanding of the mood and atmosphere in the film.I recommend this movie to anybody who has the patience to sit and focus on this excellent film. Although the beginning is appropriately slow moving and the characters names are difficult to remember, the payoff is worth the efforts. This movie is made for active film viewers and all Robert Altman fans.

After several attempts, I decided that it would be a fun parlor game to provide guests a list of characters and try to keep track of individuals' motives and try to guess who did it.

The most striking thing to me about the film is the strict British adherence to etiquette and class distinctions. The prejudicial response to the US guest and his valet, especially by Maggie Smith's character, is amusing. But it is the disrespect and abuse by the upstairs guests to the downstairs servants that makes the film so confusing.

And did I ever? The movie is based on the exceptional writing of Julian Fellowes and tells the story of some aristocratic wealthy people and their servants in the late fall of 1932. But through the directing of Robert Altman, we come to see, witness and understand much more.Fist of all, we witness the immense difference between the guests, some aristocrats and snobs and others, servants. This difference is underlined by the 'Upstairs' (where the guests sleep) and 'Downstairs' (where the staff and servants sleep, eat and work). We also sense the difference by the clothing, the manners and the snobbish behavior.Second of all, the movie is that incredible, that we witness the grand manner in which wealthy people lived in those days, the way they interacted with their help and we notice that so few things have actually changed through the ages.Britain's finest and a few Hollywood actors had been perfectly casted for this portrait of a decaying Empire, its traditions (which the British are very fond of) and of the always-hunting-for-some-fresh-meat-Hollywood. Because of the brilliant cast, the plot becomes secondary and we are being portrayed a wonderful and apparently boring, typically English, weekend. Rarely have I seen actors master the art of acting so good, that even the boredom of the characters is played perfectly.Robert Altman managed to built an eternal antithesis in this movie, may it be the wealthy vs. the poor people, servant/staff vs. master, 'downstairs' vs. 'upstairs', the British vs. the Americans (He's from America.

Even a film like MASH is inferior to the TV show and NASHVILLE becomes tedious in its third hour, whilst POPEYE is painful to sit through.GOSFORD PARK - his only British-made film - works because of a tip-top script by the English actor Julian Fellows and a waterproof cast of British thesps. It won the 2001 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and the BAFTA for Best British Film, and it's about all of those things that often fill films about England's past class, period costumes and country houses. In fact, at times it feels like a retread of Alan Bridges' little-seen 1985 costume drama THE SHOOTING PARTY in which the English upper classes congregate in a stately home for a bit of symbolic pheasant shooting on the eve of the Great War. Gosford Park isn't a real house - the film was shot at three different stately homes in the south of England and at Shepperton Studios in London.Fellows script nicely observes what a country house weekend in November 1932 must have been like the way servants are referred to by their employers' names, for instance. The tremendous cast of Equity's finest has upstairs Michael Gambon, Kristen Scott Thomas. Maggie Smith, James Wilby, Charles Dance and Jeremy Northam (as Ivor Novello), and below stairs there's Helen Mirren, Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Clive Owen, Richard E. Grant, Derek Jacobi, Emily Mortimer and Kelly McDonald. I'm sure had she not been playing Iris Murdoch at the time, a role would have been found for Judi Dench. And when the Lord of the Manor Michael Gambon is bumped off two thirds of the way through, up turns a pipe-smoking and raincoat wearing police inspector, played for comic effect by Stephen Fry. The film is loosely structured and full of fractured dialogue and half-observed and half-resolved sub-plots. There's also a couple of Americans who feel surplus to requirements, including Ryan Phillipe as a Hollywood actor posing as a Scottish valet, Henry. It has one or two lovely little moments, such as the staff standing in a doorway listening to Ivor Novello play and sing on the piano; or Kelly MacDonald's Ladysmaid, who stays up all night to wash her Ladyship's blouse, only for her Ladyship (Smith) decide the next morning she's not going to wear it. Watch closely a gem of a scene when Richard E Grant as a butler 'accidentally' drops hot coffee into the unpleasant Henry's lap - the giggling and smirking delight on the various guests' faces is a joy to behold. Sir William ends up having been killed by his illegitimate son (Owen) and his housekeeper (Mirren), whom years ago he had gotten pregnant when she worked in one of his factories - as he did with many of his employees. In fact, it's actually no more substantial than a couple of episodes of the 1970s TV series 'UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS' (no bad thing considering the undeniable quality of that programme), only with a faster pace and a 24 carat gold cast.

As another reviewer pointed out, the whodunit aspect takes a back seat to the spontaneous interactions of the characters, which are split between the filthy rich and the hired help. The story is completely non-linear. The script is literally wall-to-wall character studies, with the players moving from scene-to-scene like real people moving from room-to-room. What they do and how they got to this place is revealed only incidentally, leaving the audience to speculate as to the characters' back stories. And there is plenty of overlapping dialog to add to the ambiguity. It feels more like the viewer is spying on these people rather than watching a typical movie presentation.In true Altman style, two dozen characters are thrust together by way of a holiday weekend at a large English manor. The aristocrats are very busy, dressing, gossiping and shooting harmless birds by day, eating luxurious meals, playing games, and enjoying entertainment from a Hollywood movie star by night. They probably need some relaxation from all that work. All the while the servants are preparing food, washing clothes needlessly at night, and polishing their employers' watches with barely a moment to enjoy a meal or other extra-curricular activity themselves. But the servants and aristocracy share something in common they all have their own little stories which are revealed in bits and pieces through unselfconscious dialog.Both sides enjoy equal screen time. However, as the events progress, the viewer realizes that the hired help is not viewed in quite the same way as their aristocratic counterparts. Even from the beginning, when two of the upper-class characters are squabbling about their problems, one of the servants overhears their discourse. When one of the aristocrats realizes that eavesdropping is occurring, the reaction is rather unexpected, Don't worry, it's nobody. The servants don't really count as people, probably the prevailing view in 1930's England which had much of the same view of commoners as it had in the 16th and 17th centuries. And yet this attitude toward servants as lesser people has a profound impact on the quite unexpected ending of the film. One of the worst of the snobbish aristocrats is Countess Constance, played with perfect over-bearing stiltedness by the incomparable Maggie Smith. And of course she has one of the best lines I haven't a snobbish bone in my body. But of course she has her employee on bended knee throughout the film. You wonder if she may be a just target of the murderer's weapon! Later in the film, one of the servant characters moves up a few rungs on the hierarchical ladder literally overnight, much to the jealousy of the rest of the hired help.Part of what transpires seems very unscripted. Even by half-way through the film, the viewer only has a vague sense of who these people are. It is akin to certain science fiction films where aspects of futuristic life are presented without explanation. In Gosford Park, the stories of the characters are never announced but only hinted. Even by the moment of the murder, which occurs about 2/3rds through the story, the viewer is only beginning to understand some things about the characters, but much is left unsaid and unrevealed. One of the interesting features of the film is that the story is entirely cast-driven. The ensemble is made up of name talent, but no big Hollywood stars, which is quite a breath of fresh air from the typical star-driven offerings that Hollywood is constantly cranking out. Instead, the cast is comprised of recognizable character actors who are often in supporting roles in the larger-budgeted Hollywood films. These people are some of the best actors in the business. It's somehow fitting that they would come together for this project.One other notable aspect is that some of the best actors play the servant parts, such as Helen Mirren (academy award-winner) who plays Mrs Wilson, the head woman servant, the late Alan Bates (renowned British actor) as Mr Jennings, the head of all servants, and Derek Jacobi of Caedfel fame as Mr Probert, another butler/servant of the Lord's manor.An outstanding film, with an unexpected and sobering ending that forces you to think rather than feel fully satisfied in an escapist sort of way, like an Agatha Christie presentation might. This is a major achievement and a fitting swan song to one of the most innovative directors who worked in Hollywood, the late Robert Altman. Although this was not technically his last film, this was probably his last best achievement. Not to be missed if you're into cutting edge film-making particularly of the overlapping dialog variety. Altman wrote the textbooks on it, called MASH, The Player, and Gosford Park.

GOSFORD PARK is a gem of a film and only grows better with repeated viewings.Gosford Park is the estate owned by grumpy William McCordle (Michael Gambon), his bored wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott Thomas), his frumpy daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford), and served by a staff of servants who include the very in control Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the butler Jennings (Alan Bates), and the head of the kitchen Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins).

Among the odd assortment of guests (each with a pack of secrets and prejudices) are Maggie Smith, Tom Hollander, Charles Dance, Bob Balaban, Jeremy Northam, James Wilby, and their valets and servants Clive Owen, Kelly Macdonald, Ryan Phillippe, etc. The servants are incorporated into the staff rooms by the strange Emily Watson, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Swift et al. The arrival evening drops a few hints of problems afoot both among the guests and among the servants. The hunting party is scarred by a minor accident, but the real problem occurs at the dinner following the hunting party - a time when some of the occult problems become more obvious and culminate in the murder of the vile William McCordle. The police are called and Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) uncovers some strange evidence that leads to not only the events of the murder but also unveils many of the secrets of both guests and servants. There is a surprise ending that somehow makes all of the characters seem more human than their artificial roles they have assumed.This is a banquet of fine acting and ensemble work and adds such treasures as a series of songs performed by Jeremy Northam with great style as well as unexpected cameos by a large number of lesser known actors.

In fact, the film is more than half over before any crime is committed and, curiously, it is only after the murder of curmudgeonly womaniser William McCordle (Michael Gambon) that the film begins to lose its way a little.Like all of Altman's films, this isn't a film for the casual viewer, and those not prepared to pay attention will not last the pace. And it is a film that requires close attention due to the large cast. Some characters have few lines but they are all integral to the plot and, even when paying close attention, it can be a challenge to get a handle on who exactly is who - especially amongst the upper class characters. Other filmmakers may have chosen to combine two characters into one to simplify the storytelling process but, as always, Altman credits his audience with a degree of intelligence of which other filmmakers are not always so confident.Perhaps the only real flaw for my money is the character of Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry), who is played for a comic relief which doesn't really match the tone of what has gone before. The inclusion of Ryan Philippe's character, the American actor Henry Denton who poses as a butler for research purposes on a Charlie Chan film, is also questionable useful as an instrument for placing important information in front of the viewer, he sticks out like a sore thumb in the upstairs-downstairs milieu, even when using a Scottish accent.Overall, Gosford Park is deserving of the reputation it has won for itself and is recommended viewing for those looking for an intelligent story told at a measured pace.

D.H Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover in reverse. Lady Chatterley is in fact a Lord. And everything is different. The Lord has the right to have as many affairs with the female servants as he wants. He has the right to have as many children with these female servants as he wants and then to have the babies abandoned and sent to orphanages. Absolutely disgusting. And what's more he may keep the servants for further use eventually. When we know that we know the murder of the Lord will be accepted by everyone in his own social class as justified, that they will cover it up for the police not to find out the murderer. And what's more they will have been backboneless enough not to murder him themselves and let the servants murder him. Here Robert Altman imagines a thriller that becomes a vicious denunciation of the deepest hypocrisy you can imagine, that of the British aristocracy. There is little to add to this tale, except that all in all only the servants have the human dignity that provides them with some human feelings, including for the son that has managed to survive and is condemned to remain officially unknown. It is also the servants who have the liking and taste for the Hollywood sentimental and sentimentalese songs that are sung for the entertainment of the ladies and gentlemen who treat that music as some charming accompaniment for their simmering hatred of the world and themselves. Of course Altman also manages to put one note against the Americans in the two characters from California, one having a typically non-Anglo-Saxon name, viz. Weissman. They are vicious enough to infiltrate the servant quarters just for the sake of a film on the very same situation, hence to guarantee the realism of the servants' side of the film. But they are also gross enough to reveal the subterfuge before the end and that reveals too how much the servants hate this indiscretion that reveals their side of ,the household to someone from the other side of the household. The gap between the two social classes that live along to one another in this mansion is wider than the distance between the earth and the moon.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne "},{"Title":"Wow!

That kind of feat is AWESOME, how the thread co-operates through this film from the first shot to the last, all the while maintaining the most spectacular production design and cinematography, elements that must have taken a lot of time to get right, but seem somehow effortless. I won't get much into the plot, but if you know Altman you'll know there are a lot of interlocking stories with a colorful cast of characters who might or might not be innocent and who might or might not be who they really seem to be.

Second viewing on DVD in the comfort of home allowed me to fully enjoy it for what it is - an ensemble social satire with a huge, superb cast sparkling with delights at every turn.The murder mystery has been deliberately rendered unsubtle, with obvious, loud advertising - the incident of the missing kitchen knife and intrusive close-up shots of the poison bottle. Nor are there ingenious twists &#150; you may not have guessed the murderers (mainly because there are too many suspects) but then you're not terribly surprised when you see the solution which is not given in the usual gather-everybody-around-for-the-grand-revelation manner. Interestingly, there is some similarity to Francois Ozon's 8 women (which DID proffer the solution in the said manner) in that in both cases, it's a young girl's keen observation that unlocks the key to the mystery.A whodunit Gosford Park definitely is not, but rather a social satire of the British Upstairs, downstairs phenomenon in-between the war years, with as an add-on the irritating impact of the New World, particularly Hollywood (the Countess doesn't bothered with telling the difference between a director and a producer).Masterful Robert Altman helms the direction of the almost astronomical permutation of relationships among the characters with amazing dexterity. Incidentally, he has been recognized in this year's Oscar with its special life achievement award. The introduction features the beat moment of the evening, with Lily Tomlin and Meryl Streep giving a superlative demonstration of his trademark style &#150; the overlapping dialogue, which is seen in abundance in GP, as in many other Altman films.Not much more need be said other than sit back, and enjoy every little bit of the exquisite detail, and don't fall into the trap of looking for the usual whodunit here. Instead, I would like to use whatever space IMDb allows to take a look at what SOME (there are too many) of these great actors have been up to since GP.Maggie Smith, who rules every scene she appears in as Countess Constance, continued with a couple more installments in Harry Potter and also created in Keeping Mum (2005) a wickedly delicious character (Grace Hawkin) that makes you fall in love with murders.Michael Gambon (the hateful, murdered aristocrat), unlike Maggie Smith, got involved in the Harry Potter series only part-way through, taking over the role of Headmaster Dunbledore from Richard Harris upon whose unfortunate death after the first two installments. His most recent screen appearance is in an almost cameo role in the remake of The Omen (2006) as the man who possesses the secret and the tools to killing the Antichrist.Kristin Scott Thomas co-starred with Maggie Smith in the said Keeping mum, playing a much more human character than the icy cold wife of the murdered man in GP.Another top-notch British actress Helen Mirren (the taciturn head housekeeper with a dark secret) went on after GB to lead the cast in the acclaimed Calendar girls (2003).About Clive Owen (the valet who has a hidden past) I need not say much &#150; King Arthur, Closer, Sin City, Derailed, Inside Man.Jeremy Northam (the crooning American entertainer) played an important role in Possession (2002), of the romantic poet in the past segment of the parallel stories in that movie.Ryan Philippe's performance in the first half of GP is adequate, playing a professional actor impersonating a role of a valet. When the actor resumes his real identity in the second half, however, Philippe's wooden expression fails to convey the difference. The recent Oscar winning movie Crash (2005) gave Philippe a role better suited to him, - contemporary, a young police officer.Bob Babalan, co- creator and writer of GP and taking the role of the gay American movie director, was seen recently in a minor role in Capote (2005) which earned Philip Seymour Hoffman his overdue Oscar.Charles Dance (typical aristocrat Lord Stockbridge) appeared in Francois Ozon's (again) Swimming pool (2003) which is, unfortunately (for any male role in this movie), a movie on the psychological duel between the two women leads.Tom Hollander (Commander Anthony Meredith) was the clownish suitor Mr. Collins in the latest version of Pride and prejudice (2005) For Alan Bates (who is in charge of everything downstairs) who passed away in 2003, I can go nearly half a century back to Whistle down the wind (1961), in which he played the man, who was mistaken by Hayley Mill's character as Christ in the second coming.Playing the two key downstairs characters are Emily Watson and Kelly Macdonald. While the former starred in Punch-drunk love (2002), the latter had a minor role in Finding Neverland, playing the boy Peter Pan.And don't let me forget Stephen Fry (the sensibly low key inspector) who appeared recently in V for Vendetta (2005), playing an ill-fated mentor to Natalie Portman's character.

Second, the resolution is woven into the story, but is only a very minor part of it.

Thus it is not only overlong with too many side notes, they become more irrelevant for the viewer during the movie. So in the last part we have the reverse of the beginning Almost everything is known; we can easily see what's important and what's not so it becomes somewhat boring.Still interesting are other ideas a movie-maker (also American) is thrown in to add a layer to the story.

Nevertheless this is still an interesting movie that gives a good insight on how society in the period between the two world wars was organized in the UK (and in other European countries as well).In the beginning of the movie you'll only get to see the differences between the high society and their servants in the 1930's, but as the movie progresses, you'll see that the image of perfection and separation between the two classes wasn't always that clear. Even though Sir William McCordle lives like an aristocrat, with servants, hunting parties, dinner parties,... the man isn't really loved at all. He is in fact a wealthy industrialist who is only accepted by the family, the aristocracy and his 'friends' because of his money. And they are all prepared to go a long way to get it...Gosford Park is a complicated, but very interesting story that has been spiced up with murder, hate, love, deceit, romance, betrayal,... and that has become a very fine movie thanks to the good direction of Robert Altman. Not only has he been able to portray his characters in a very fine way, he has also managed to give the movie a feeling of authenticity. If you are interested in this time period and the people that lived then, than this movie is definitely something for you.

Starting as a study of class divisions, it soon slides its swift lens to the mutual dependent worlds of master and servant, slowly yet surely exposing the links that bind both seemingly disparate worlds. What's most engaging about Altman's approach is his fluid camera-work. There are so many nuances to be had in what we see that most require multiple viewings to decipher each. The rich tapestry of English actors is excellent to behold and brings the hitherto formulaic Agatha Christie to life but the slightly heavy-handed socio-political comment spoils it a bit; the rich are all too often portrayed as caricatures (with the exception of Maggie Smith's character); while the only American is baffled by such class divisions - not that class snobbery was ever an issue in 1930s America of course!

Throw in a Who's Who of contemporary British actors and what can go wrong? Well, nothing exactly, but despite some good moments the film never fully lifts off.The main innovation, of course, is the focus on the downstairs segment of country-house society. It's an admirable attempt to give the servants more-than-equal time, for once, and it's not entirely surprising coming from this populist director. But what is surprising is how Altman, for once, does a little *too* much explaining, falling into the Merchant/Ivory trap of fetishizing the period. For instance, did you know that servants visiting country houses would be called by their employers' names? And did you know that latecomers to dinner would be sent a tray rather than being allowed to join the party? And did you know that this fork is for this and that fork is for that, etc., etc. These things may not have been dealt with much on screen before, but that doesn't exactly make them interesting cinema in themselves. The lapse in judgment is perhaps because Altman, for all the authentic Englishness of everything, knows that he's making a movie for Americans; he includes, for instance, an amused American character to goggle over everything, and even gives Helen Mirren the line Mr. Weissman's an American; they do things differently there. It's a rather cheap joke, but one guaranteed to get laughs on both sides of the Atlantic, if for different reasons.The film doesn't quite ignore its upper-class characters (we see a lot more begging from them than we are accustomed to seeing from rich people in the movies), but it's the point at which the two classes intersect &#150; in theory the most interesting part of society &#150; that the movie inexplicably shies away from. We know that masters and servants are having sex, for instance &#150; hell, the plot hinges on this fact. Why then are we not given the real-life exchanges between the characters that surround all these couplings? How do Elsie and Sir William talk to each other when they're alone, *really* alone, for instance? Her love for him is obviously genuine &#150; she sees something in him that no one else does, and essentially condemns herself to a life of irretrievable ruin by speaking up to defend him in the bosom of vipers. Why? It's the movie's most fascinating and immediate moment (and Richard E. Grant makes it even more so with his half-smile at its conclusion), but Altman doesn't follow up, and overall seems to be more interested in maintaining the bland British tone than in producing any real content.As for the performances, it's hard to find a really bad one, of course. Helen Mirren and Emily Watson, perhaps England's two greatest living actresses, are perfect, and make the material seem better than it is. Maggie Smith is nastier than usual perhaps, and looks terrible, but she's still funny, even if she's done the same thing better a hundred times before. Eileen Atkins, Kelly Macdonald, Grant, and many of the other servants distinguish themselves in tiny ways worth watching for. The one sour note is struck by Stephen Fry, but it's less that the performance is unlikable than it is that the character is badly written and unfunny.All in all, the movie is not a total failure. But it's essentially empty, and not nearly as much fun as it's been made out to be. It just doesn't have any more juice than the Agatha-Christie movie fantasies it's trying to unpack for us, and that can only come as a disappointment. 6 out of 10.

The cast were all excellent and the overall impression that the action below-stairs was more important than that above-stairs was emphasised by the detective in his attitude to the importance of the servants and his blundering failure to solve the crime (a crime which of course wasn't the point of the story). In fact, as one reviewer pointed out, the effectiveness of those on either side of the class system was mirrored in the relation between the detective and his constable (who did know what he was doing).

While the PR people decided to market this as a murder mystery, the murder happens late in the proceedings and doesn't really have that much to do with the movie, so if you're looking for Agatha Christie you'll be disappointed. This is rather a look at the weird symbiotic relationship of servants and their employers. It's really more about the servants and how their lives go on; they know everything that goes on upstairs, while the upper class is fairly oblivious to pretty much everything.While the movie is a typical Altman ensemble piece, some performers stand out, most notably Maggie Smith, whose arrogant and intelligent grand dame is the most entertaining character of the bunch.

If you're into Merchant Ivory-style period pieces, and you can keep all the stories straight in this ensemble story, then Gosford Park is your cup of tea!

The broad comedy in his scenes seemed to me to be inferior to the subtle social satire and wit that infected the rest of the film.I was also rather surprised by being tremendously moved by Helen Mirren's final scene; up until then I had been enjoying the film on a rather cerebral and analytical level, but she just blew me away with her show of emotion.Lots of things to say about the film  first, what a fine actress Kelly McDonald is, despite her young years; the tremendous pleasure of watching actors like Alan Bates, Michael Gambon, Emily Watson (the real star of the movie for me) and Charles Dance; the fully realised setting which made you believe this is what it really was like to be a servant in the years before World War 2.And thank God for DVDs.  Far be it from me to question Robert Altman's judgement, but I thought that just about every deleted scene on the DVD merited inclusion in the final film; in fact, I think a couple of them are actually needed.This is where novels are better than films you can go for depth by including rather than brevity by editing.Still, a fine film, and one of the few that I would actually watch again.

This movie gets the nod.Many people hate this movie.  Many seem to think that it's intended to be an Agatha Christie-style mystery.  (It isn't.)  One commenter apparently thought that it was never made clear who committed the murder.  (It was.) Several people thought this movie had too many characters.  (Depends on your perspective, I suppose.)  Another commenter said that there was no character development in this movie.  My jaw dropped on that one. Character is what this movie is about.There's no question that it takes some effort to absorb the film;  you really need to see it at least two or three times.  And yes, the audio is deliberately filled many times with several simultaneous conversations, making all of them hard to follow.  But for me, the multitude of characters and constant, fast-paced conversations made this movie into something that transcended an ordinary movie.  I felt transported into the world the movie was creating.There are some weaknesses.  As much as I like Stephen Fry, his character was too cartoonish, and his entry into the film marks a turning point.  There are still plenty of good moments after the murder (including some featuring Fry), but they're fewer and far between.  The bit about the butler (played by the recently-deceased Alan Bates) being a conscientious objector during World War I also didn't work very well.  And Bob Balaban's character as the annoying Hollywood producer was also too heavy-handed.Counterbalancing this, and then some, are some strong (as in, hurricane-caliber) performances from Michael Gambon, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jeremy Northam, Helen Mirren, and others...but of course, most of all, Maggie Smith as the wonderfully snobbish and yet strangely likeable, frail old duchess.Equally charming are the sets.  I can't say that I know what an old English country house should look like, but this one looks impressive, authentic or not.  And I can't help but feel more comfortable downstairs with the servants than upstairs with the snobs.  The pacing and transitioning are frequently brilliant;  shots of the snobs relaxing after dinner that cut to shots of frantic cleanup work in the kitchen, for example.The music is another strong point.  We got the soundtrack for this movie, a rarity for us.  The songs sung by Northam alone are simply priceless.  Oh what I wouldn't give for a real, old-fashioned lounge with someone like him singing earthy, witty songs.  (My guess is that any cocktail party where Northam is a guest is instantly a hundred times more interesting.)It can be fairly said of this movie that it lacks a discernible plot.  Oh, things happen.  The guests arrive;  they have dinner the first evening; there's a shooting party the next day, with lunch in a rotunda;  dinner again that night;  the murder;  the investigation.  But it all happens at such a dreamy, langorous pace that it hardly seems like anything happens. If you like plot-driven movies, to the point where you can't stand a movie that isn't plot-heavy, then Gosford Park definitely is not for you.  But for me, this ties back to the point I made earlier about feeling drawn into another world.I saw Gosford Park nine or ten times in the theater.  I've seen it that many times again on DVD.  (The quality of the DVD is very good in my opinion.) I'll see it many more times in the future.  Let that be my final comment.

Did I say action? I meant the long, slow buildup that leads to the lethargic middle that leads to the dragging ending.There's a key difference between slow and boring; if Gosford Park had great character development and a great payoff, the buildup would be worth it. But it has a bog-standard mystery plot that pretends to be a fascinating dissection of Christie, but is in fact more like Christie on a very bad, really listless day. The social commentary all seems so predictable; the rich people are blind snobs, and the servants are both warmer and more observant. Big flippin' deal! That's the message of ALL these manor house mysteries, for the most part.Shame that such a great cast was wasted here. I know all these actors from my years of watching all things British - they're practically old friends! - but I could barely distinguish one character from another. There are too many people to keep straight, too many agendas, too many names - a frequent problem in the mystery genre, actually. Add to the formula an incompetent inspector and you've got a completely by-the-numbers story. The only innovative thing here is the positioning of the camera; the movie presents a series of continuously moving middle shots, which is a nice idea, but ultimately as boring as the storyline.Maybe it didn't help that I watched this movie in the company of the Shallowest Man in the Universe, who kept falling asleep, but in all honesty I was hard-pressed to stay awake myself.

Well, not necessarily in the vein of the cinematography of, say, Amelie, but in keeping a flow going.

Ryan Phillippe gives his first adult performance very well, putting on a believable accent and making his character very charming. Emily Watson is terrific as usual. Kelly MacDonald, the anchor of the film, is wonderful and gives a very underrated performance. Academy Award nominations went to the fairly good Helen Mirren and very funny Maggie Smith. Credit must also be given to Stephen Fry (a neat character in the film), Bob Balaban, Michael Gambon and the various other cast members.--Now that I think about it more, the main quality of the film is the way it manages to cleverly show the audience the way the house is run - separating servant from leisure man/woman, rich from poor, rags to riches. Very neat factor in the film.--I loved the setting for the film. It gave it even more of an Agatha Christie feeling, and really made the whodunit story more atmospheric. The house itself looked delicious, marvellously decorated in several stunning and I'll bet expensive ornaments and jewels.THE BAD--There are no particularly memorable scenes or sequences in this film. When I look back on movies I love to think that part was my favourite or I'd see the movie all over again just to see that part! but I wasn't really mesmerised by this picture. It was somewhat forgettable.--This movie is too long. It could've been cut down considerably.

Henry James, American, lived and worked most of his life in England, as did T.S. Eliot. Many British-born actors and actresses have become `great stars' on the other side of the Atlantic.More recently we have seen how the Dorset man, Stephen Daldry, crossed the Atlantic and put together `The Hours' (qv), most definitely a great film. In the case of `Gosford Park', Robert Altman came across to Britain and put together an incredible cast to make an enthralling film. Cultural exchanges, are of course, always beneficial in all senses.So with `Gosford Park', a well-written, well-directed and well-acted film which affords delightful viewing. In the style of a stage play, the action takes place in the upstairs lounge of the wealthy ladies and gents, and in the downstairs kitchens of the staff, servants, butlers, cooks and so on. Whether there is any real story to the film is of very secondary importance one of the invited gentry dies. Who killed him? It does not really matter, and anyway the film leaves us with this ambiguous doubt in the air.What does matter is the personal clashes, whether upstairs or downstairs or in my lady's chamber, or simply in the never-ending passages of the great mansion, to the west of London. The omnipresent tendency to snobbishness, by both the upper and lower classes is manifest in scintillating dialogues, often witty, and so wonderfully carried out in the best British tradition of characteriological theatre pieces. Everyone from Henry Fielding to Tom Stoppard could not be but well pleased with this really delicious offering.The cast is magnificent; from the affected accent of the upper classes to the `inferior' versions of the English from Leicester or Scotland, one immediately senses part of the essence of this film. The heavily-ladelled hypocracy of the post-Victorian landed-gentry in the 1930's take care of what remains of the vestiges of their supposed dignity. This film runs fairly close to and should be compared with Jane Campion's `The Portrait of a Lady' (1996) (qv) and of course the above-mentioned Stephen Daldry film, as all three capture so splendidly the sociological concepts of the times in superb character interpretations, something which failed miserably in Martin Scorsese's `The Age of Innocence' (1993) (qv). Fortunately, I have the film on VHS and plan to see it again a couple of times before Christmas, so engrossing it is. Thankyou Mr Altman - and all your team - for making this truly enjoyable piece.

It is set in England between the wars and it chooses as a setting a high class manor that is the scene of many classical Agatha Christie crime stories. There is even a murder to solve, though it does not seem to be in the focus of the director. What is in focus is the class relationship between masters and servants and whoever knows the British society knows that this is an important aspect of the British life until today. A multitude of superb actors, most of them British do their usual fine job, and it is always a delight to watch Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, or Emily Watson in action.But, but... all is unfortunately lost in the never-ending verbage, in the confusing camera work which may be the delight of critics but never helps the viewer to better understand the message.

It's a mystery, alright, and there is a murder;  but, they're ancillary to the film.  If there is a puzzle, it's the question of how the British nobility managed to survive as long as they did on their cachet of social prestige, why their indolence, concupiscence, social isolation, and wanton self-destructiveness didn't drive them to extinction, like the Romanoffs, long ago.  Both the servants and the nobility hate each other.  A valet describes Lady McCordle as a `snobbish cow, completely `useless.'  Another valet ridicules his master as thinking that he's `God almighty,' to which a maid replies, `They all do.'  The upstairs nobility are all hopelessly incompetent;  for example, when the butler demands the whereabouts of a guest from his valet, the valet replies  `I washed him and I dressed him and if he can't find his way to the drawing room, it's not my fault.'  The upper classes are viewed as `pathetic.'  The nobility, on the other hand, though they use their servants as sex toys and as their personal conduits of gossip, treat their servants as if they were burdens to be borne.  Lady Trentham is typical  in the process of `breaking in' a new maid,' she acts as though she's bearing Christ's own crucifix.  She exclaims, `There's nothing more exhausting, Is there?'  So the real mystery of the movie is why the system moved along as smoothly as it did in the face of all the glaring inconsistencies and injustices.  Altman doesn't hit you over the head with an answer, but does suggest some clues;  for example, in many ways, servants and masters are very similar.  We see the social stratification amongst the servants themselves, and their love, like their masters, of humiliating others.  We see the upper classes feeding off the human warmth of the lower, the lower classes feeding off the social prestige of the upper.  The upper and the lower classes use each other.

It's good, but very very long. This type of work especially the subject matter is very much to my taste, but even I found it rather tedious at times, if not uninteresting. It begins well with fascinating character development, only to crawl to a very disappointing climax. If it can be even considered a climax. Altman, ever the master of the ensemble, is true to form. About 50 different characters running around, most to which he teases you with a glimpse of their personality, and secret lives. Again, this is what he does better than anyone else. That part I enjoyed very much, hearing the meaningless banter of the nobility and the not so inconspicuous grousing of the servants. When the plot develops, well... it could have been better. There was an opportunity certainly for a Poirot type to uncover the mysteries, instead Altman chooses to play detective, judge and jury himself, omnisciently and insert an absurdly incompetent Inspector, that we are left to assume enables the perpetrator to wriggle off the hook. The politics of Mr. Altman I'm afraid, as usual, are too transparent in this film. We see the lampooning of the idle class, and the revisionist attempt to convince us that they were to a person, completely useless as human beings. I suppose that's fashionable nowadays, however ridiculous and immature it may be. But to be fair, the 1930s were probably the decade of true decline for these people and their style of life, and many were indeed carrying on in a manner that was no longer suitable to the times, or compatible with their straitened financial means. Sort of like that half hour after last call, when the lights are on, and you can still finish your drink but every minute brings you closer to being asked to leave. Furthermore, Altman in a sense commutes a death sentence with his screenplay (again i.e. The Player) simply I guess because of his politics. Justifiable murder is not a new concept, but its still wrong even in this century. Luxurious, intriguing, and wonderfully photographed, this film will assuredly satisfy an appetite for observing English country life between the Wars.  For the fan of the juicy whodunit mystery, however, you may find it sadly bereft of substance.

Sounds great, right? It's elaborate, it takes place in 1932 at a country house, there's a murder, and the ensemble cast is brilliant.  There the similarity ends.  The picture is really about Robert Altman's narcissistic obsession with presenting the above elements for a sophisticated, ideally insomniac audience that doesn't exist outside the foggy dens of film critics.  Two things not to expect if you see it1. Plot. The murder belongs to the last third of the film, and no decent lead has yet been planted by that yawning stage.2.  Dialog. Much of it delivered sotto voce and irrelevantly.  Voices fade out as the elegantly dressed and coifed guests disappear down a hall or descend a staircase.  See it if you must as I did on tape with captioning turned on.With a problematic plot and confusing dialog, what is left?  Well, there's the meticulous attention to period fashion, the delicate interplay between servant and master, between upstairs and downstairs, the social fencing between the moribund upper classes and the more vulgar, moneyed elite that was about to replace them. Maggie Smith is the caricature of the old; Balaban of the new.  (Bob Balaban had a hand in the writing of  GP.)  Well and good; it is probably the audience's fault that so many liked the film for its accurate treatment of the manners and mores of the Victorian (!) period. Between the Great War and WWII, perhaps it is hard for some to distinguish Victorian, Edwardian and Modern attitudes.

Hell, I wonder if they didn't decide to make this film while playing Clue. Basically someone is throwing a hunting party and a whole pack of rich snobs gather in one house for a night or two, talk, gossip, and then there's a murder. One major thing wrong here is that there are so many characters that you cannot possibly keep up with names! Not only are you barraged with these people's names but you are given their social status and told their secrets. But what good is that if you can't remember who they are? On top of that, there were several actresses who had such a strong accent that I couldn't understand a word they said! I tried so hard, especially on one blonde actress, and I could not make sense of one damn word! One has to wonder why this film was even made. It's definitely not a mainstream movie. Besides being a murder mystery, it serves up a look at the view on society and social status in 1930s England. But that's all. All you'll see in this film are snobbish blue bloods talking scandals and money while their servants gossip while preparing meals, etc. What's the point? Throw a bunch of boring old people into a house with hired help and you have a movie? Whatever. The real mystery is why in the world this movie came to be. It's all about absolutely nothing. The characters sleep around, listen to the piano, and play cards. Exciting. One old lady in particular was so rude you just want to jump into the movie and slap her around. Really, avoid this unless you want a good look at the 1930s upper and lower class, that's the only thing this film is good for. If not, avoid this movie and save your money and time, this is a whole lot of hooey over baloney.

The characters are all wonderful to watch, with Maggie Smith really standing out. Jeremy Northam, as always, is superb, and plays perhaps one of the only truly 'sane' people at the mansion. The murder is very much second to the interwoven lives and hidden secrets of many of the characters in the story. My only criticisms are that the story is a little slow in the beginning, (although by no means boring), and that Stephen Fry was perhaps a little too comical in his role as Inspector Thompson.

Awards are no longer given  based on the merit of the film, but on who the academy (whom I picture in my mind to be quite like the snobbish upper class in this film) feels deserves it for some reason or another, and even goes as far as to try and make up for their more obvious mistakes by making further ones (i.e. Russel Crowe not winning this year, I'm convinced due to the fact he really didn't deserve the one for gladiator the year before).So, in conclusion, I'd just like to point out that Christopher Nolan is a very talented man, and should not have missed out on the Oscar for his brilliant work.  At least I can find solace in the fact that while the Academy is getting old, Mr. Nolan (and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson, for that matter) will be around for a while and will eventually earn enough political sway to earn the credit they already deserve.And as a final note, you'd figure that an Oscar winning picture could at least find someone to write a decent synopsis for the rental cover...this is a movie about social classes, the murder mystery hardly exists at all.

Even though the end was somewhat disappointing I liked knowing that Mr. Williams's son was supposedly the murderer. It was very unexpected; this is the only thing I really liked about the ending. The whole cast is amazingly adequate; they all gave believable and challenging performances. Kristin Scott Thomas was great in portraying the leading character. She always shows us her talent. Even if her performance wasn't as remarkable as the one she gave in The English Patient I consider her very appropriate for the role. Ryan Phillips gives an interesting performance, it was much better than the one he gave in Cruel Intentions, it was outstanding. The academy award nominee Emily Watson keeps amazing me as always as well as Maggie Smith who delivers a riveting performance as the old upper-class woman. I'm glad all these performances were recognized with an Actor award for best ensemble cast, since they really offer a tremendous reading and understanding of their characters. Godsford Park showed exquisite care in preparing the scenes of 1932 England and an accurate eye for the costumes, as well as outstanding performances from the actors.

As it is however, Gosford Park is a memorable motion picture experience, which retains a certain level of nostalgic wit, even when plunging into the sometimes dark depths of it's multiple characters.  Perhaps, in time, this will even be a film to rival Altman's masterpiece MASH.   By employing such excellent veteran actors, such as Maggie Smith, Derek Jacobi, Michael Gambon, Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Helen Mirren (just to name a few) and combining them with lesser known talents, Altman gives us a wry, heartfelt objective portrait of the class struggles in England, while sympathising with all involved.  Standout performances, particularly Maggie Smith, who doubtlessly generates the vast majority of the laughs, are complementary to the superb script by Oscar winner Julie Fellowes.  The mystery is lurid, yet at all times we feel the characters hidden pasts, some of which are revealed to us, some of which are not.  All in all, Gosford Park is a delightful Altman triumph, that harkens back unapologetically to the heyday of classic mysteries such as the Thin Man.

Most of cast comprises well known British actors, all of whom deliver good performances. However, the plot line is weak, and the promise created in the first half of the movie is not kept.The movie's aim is confused. There are some `Upstairs Downstairs' elements, which seem a trifle unnecessary, since they are not germane to the murder story. As social comment they are gratuitous and inadequate.  The master-servant relationship is a complex one, and  Messrs. Altman and Balaban do not seem to understand it. The movie is a murder mystery, something that is not apparent for the first half of the film. When the movie does get down to it, its development and unravelling take place in a highly unsatisfactory manner. The sense of mystery is only inadequately created, as it is not very clear why anyone should have a motive. The actual motive becomes clear in the last few minutes of the film, and is something that would have been difficult to guess. In any mystery story, the teller has to play fair. He must provide sufficient information for the reader to solve the mystery himself. This Altman fails to do. Thus the suspense is created by not quite playing by the rules. There also the bumbling inspector with the competent sergeant. One wonders if this is more social comment, or merely an opportunity  that Altman thought too good to pass, given that Stephen Fry plays the inspector. Though Inspector Thompson's explanation about why milk is poured before the tea, was rather dismaying.The film cannot make up its mind. Eventually, the mystery bit takes a back seat, as does the social comment bit. Not surprisingly, with nothing driving it, the plot flails. The setting is good, and there is attention to detail, which brings out the atmosphere of a '20s-'30s English stately home quite well.

The people who gather at the McCordle family mansion for a weekend's shooting include an appallingly snobby Countess (the delightful Maggie Smith), grumpy host Sir William, an Jewish-American director, a British celebrity, various upper-class gentry and the horde of servants that includes Mary Macrechan, a young maid through whose eyes we mainly see events unfold. Almost all have secrets. Many have motivations for murder.There over 30 speaking parts, a bewildering number of different plotlines and initially it is hard to remember who is who, which lord married which lady for the money, who is blackmailing whose daughter and exactly how many affairs are going on. Though I still rate Memento's brilliantly crafted screenplay as the year's best, the beauty of Gosford Park's Oscar-winning screenplay is how it makes nearly everyone clearly fit in to the scheme of things eventually and that it gives even characters with tiny parts depth. Director Robert Altman is famous for films with large casts and his skill in handling them is on show here, as he brings out fine performances from everyone, though Steven Fry's bumbling inspector seems out of place.The film does a fine job of skewering upper-class hypocrisy and arrogance, but also has a lot of compassion and wit, and a very good resolution.

The most misleading thing you can say about this film is that it's not really a detective story.  It IS a detective story, as much as anything is.  It should not be approached any other way.That's why the following spoilers really are spoilers (even though I'm not going to say who did it).The material is EXACTLY the same as Agatha Christie at her most classical.  The year is 1932, the setting a large country house.  (Arguably, this is where Christie set every single one of her Poirot novels, and many of the others, besides - even Death Comes at the End, which is set in Ancient Egypt and heavily filled in with local colour, might as well take place in an English country house of 1932.  The year is crucial.  Books set as late as the 1960s take class relations as they existed in 1932 or thereabouts, with the least alteration necessary to keep up with the times.)  There's a party of some sort, and guests are present.  One or two of the guests are exotic (in this case, from Hollywood ... well, one of them is Ivor Novello, who was in fact Welsh, and counting him there are in a complicated sort of way THREE in the Hollywood party, but the point is that they form a small minority and everyone views them as outsiders).  Servants are everywhere.  Grudges are aired.  At least half of those present are hiding something.  The victim of the murder is a loathsome old patriarch; with one or two exceptions, nobody is particularly sorry to see him go, and at least three people THAT WE KNOW OF have a convincing reason to kill him.The only rule which Christie keeps and Altman breaks is that the servants, from the reader's point of view, be above suspicion.  Here the servants are just as much a part of the story as their masters.  Which, in fact, makes the story no less classical.  Christie was snob enough to make the servants part of the story only on very rare occasions, but when they WERE part of the story, they were suspects - and on at least one occasion (I'm sure I could think of more if I tried) a servant turned out to be the murderer.  Interestingly, an even faster rule of Christie's is that the exotic elements of the party are never serious suspects and certainly never guilty, unless they also turn out to be not really exotic after all - if, say, the Austrian writer is really the assumed identity of the missing half-brother everyone had been talking about.  It's interesting that Altman has no interest in breaking THIS rule.  The three exotic characters are, beyond doubt, innocent  (So is the central character, Mary; so are a few others whose alibi the camera explicitly establishes.  EVERYONE else is a suspect.  This is how Christie would have had it.)Altman takes THE classical Christie story and gives complex realism.  He shows us what the servants were doing.  He shows us more about the psychology of class relations than I would have thought possible in such a short time.  It's just as well that he does this, for he lacks Christie's supreme skill at misdirection, or anything like it if we find ourselves failing to suspect the right people, it's not because we've been led to devote our energies suspecting the wrong people, but because we were distracted by all the fascinating sociological buttressing.  Fair enough.  Altman doesn't use his skill to cheat; we have all the clues we need.Up until the actual murder, all is perfection.  This is the bit that Agatha Christie would have strained to make interesting; Altman succeeds effortlessly and three times as well as he really needs to (which is a GOOD thing).  After the murder, where Christie would start to really get going, Altman seems to lose interest (he's stated in interviews that he really didn't have much interest in this part, but that's no excuse).  The strange position in which the actor-pretending-to-be-a-valet finds himself is interesting, but neglected by the script, as is the unravelling of the crime.  Too much of the second half is devoted to showing us again what we've already seen.Oh, and to the excruciatingly laboured routine in which Detective Melchit - sorry, Stephen Fry - demonstrates how much dumber he is than his constable.  Yes, the upper-class detective is a twit and the working-class policeman is capable.  Hooray for the working class.  (It's jarring, as well as being a cheap shot.  None of the other master/servant relationships had been this shallowly defined.)  I like the fact that the guilty parties were uncovered by accident, and that Scotland Yard didn't have a chance because the thick layer of snobbery which covered the south of England would have to be dismantled rather than cut through; but surely this point would have carried more force if the detective had been a competent professional (true professionals being another class altogether), whose inability to solve the crime hadn't been his fault.  I see no reason to question the servants, says Stephen Fry breezily.  Here Altman fails to understand what he was doing.  He thought he was merely satirising Agatha Christie, but in the GOOD parts of the film, he was in fact doing something far more impressive - he was creating an alternate, richer, more socially aware version of her.

It is so fascinating anyway that I must recommend it and you should go see it. The movie is really about two classes of Britains the servants and the nobles. It has a lot to say and the interactions are interesting and meaningful. Importantly (to an action flick guy like me), the film doesn't try to be overly artistically subtle or coy -- it has something to say and just says it without a lot of fluff or melodrama.

The story (such as it is) only really surfaces in the final third of the film, preceeded by a protracted and meandering opening. What emerges is more of 'whosgonnageddit?' than a 'whodunnit?'. The film reads like a regular TV movie, and is elevated beyond it's station by Altman's involvement, and the fantastic ensemble cast. What is really here is a generic detective story wrapped up an expertly realised period piece. Julian Fellowes' screenplay has the expected mix of odd characters, red herrings, and the unforgivable inclusion of that old chestnut - the dithering detective with the clever constable in tow. Thrown into the mix are an American producer, a mysterious young Scottish manservant, and Ivor Novello, seemingly to add some kind of credence to the story. Too many peripheral characters are also bandied about to throw you off the plot, or simply to hide to the fact that there isn't one.The film looks wonderful, is beautifully shot, and the cast are uniformly excellent, but the whole enterprise is merely the build-up for the final pay-off, which when it comes is so obvious that anyone without a clue must've been asleep (which is possible).

Both were enthralling and cna keep any eye interested throughout. They are the types of the classic murder mystery and probably have inspired many with spoofs and spin-oofs.  There is an obvious reason for that and it is because of the entertainment and incapturement of caring and wanting the plot's knowledge.  This film is a scorn on these types of classic stories. It is a scorn on film in general and is a scorn on the human race.It is quite reasonable, I should believe, that the Oscars are brought up. It is or (or actually maybe WAS) heartwrenching that the Academy would nominate this at all.  A travesty at all.  However, not only that, but an incredible film that played all the rules right and perfect for these tragic times about heroism and harship was out.  The war epic Black hawk Down truly shakes the spirit.  The Academy rejected it.  That, again, alone is a travesty.  The math here can be easily done.  Sometimes horrible events occur.  Many times with the great name of film.The script surely deserves the Razzy.  Yet, this world was mistaken and the Oscar was given as hopefull hearts sunk.  Things went down hill for me from there on with the ceremony.  This film is going to be seen and maybe should be seen witht he hope of learning with the true good hearts of people who love film.  Maybe this accident will either be forgotten or become unprophitable.  This was probably the worst film of 2001.  The situations demonstrate some of the modern misguided horrors.

I tend to love movies of this type.  I am a major Anglophile.  It was a little slow in spots, however.  I did enjoy the way that the numerous story lines are masterfully juggled, but then that is a trademark of the director, Robert Altman.  All the performances were quite good; however, I find that critics (and the Academy) have praised the wrong actors.  Dame Maggie Smith was very good, but did nothing different from what she usually does.  Helen Mirren???  I have great respect for her acting (see The Madness of King George for a true showcase of her talent), but she spent most of the movie walking around scowling and had one good scene at the end.  I thought the standout performance was Emily Watson.  She is amazing in everything I have seen her in and she does not disappoint here.So, in a nutshell, for those of you who have not seen the film, I suggest to wait until it comes out on video or DVD, rent it, and curl up on your couch with a cup of hot tea.  You'll either have a nice little cinematic experience, or an excellent nap, depending on your taste in movies.

It's an apparently faithful recreation of the times, complete with decadence and snobbery, but to what end? And hasn't that been done a thousand times? Yes, the English aristocracy of the early 20th century were heartless snobs. And? I don't need Robert Altman to tell me this. What, after all, was the purpose of Masterpiece Theater? There are too many throw away plot elements, played by too many interchangeable characters to hold my interest or even to allow me the opportunity to care about any of them. Bob Balaban, who was also one of the producers of the movie, plays a Hollywood producer, making a movie about a murder mystery set in an English manor house. That would have been a nice touch if it weren't both thoroughly transparent and cliched, not to mention trivial and irrelevant to the plot. This kind of movie was parodied in Murder By Death man years ago, and Altman adds nothing new to the genre. I remember no more than 10 minutes of interesting plot developments. It's a technically competent and good-looking movie, with some fine moments, but it has all the significance of the forgotten songs that Northam plays on the piano.

Yet it was directed by the American Robert Altman who has become the master of the ensemble movie, whether it be `The Player' or (less successfully) `Pret-A-Porter'.Gosford Park &#150; actually Syon House in west London, near where I live &#150; is the stately home of Sir William (Michael Gambon) and Lady Sylvia McCordle (Kristin Scott Thomas) who invite some relations and guests to a shooting party in 1932. Before too long, Sir William has been murdered and writer Julian Fellowes &#150; who gives the cast some wonderful lines in a richly-textured script &#150; ensures that there are plenty of suspects with a whole variety of theoretical motives. In fact, Sir William is such an unpleasant character that we don't really care that he's been killed and the rites and rituals of the British upper class are dissected with such fascination that we don't care that much who killed him either. But tradition decrees that we have a murderer and a motive and we are given at least one of each. There are so many fine performances from so many well-known (at least to a British audience) faces - Alan Bates, Jeremy Northam, Charles Dance, Clive Owen, Robert E Grant, Helen Mirren, Emily Watson, and many more &#150; but it is the aged Maggie Smith as the Countess of Trentham who has some of the best lines and ultimately steals the show.

It takes alot for me to be bored by even the worst of films but this one sure did.You might be thinking from my previous comments that I think this is a terrible film but you would be wrong in that assumption.  In fact I think the film has been admirable assests.  The cast is superb but they are not forced to strain themselves at all as there are no stand-out perfomances. There are far too many characters and storylines for even a 10-hour movie. It would have been better to simply cut out perhaps a dozen unimportant characters and stick to the real meat of the story.  But if Altman had done that he would not be able to brag about the great cast he has.  While some may argue that the whole point of the film is the fact there are so many plotlines I think that is alot of crap, good films have a coherent, compelling storyline, enough said.For years I have heard about how great a director Altman is.  Am I missing something?  I just don't understand what everyone sees in him.  Never once has he directed from a good script, it always seems like he just shows up on the set points a camera in the direction of the actors and expects magic to happen.  It very rarely does.

For me, the only thing that made me pay any attention was Maggie Smith who played a hilarious British rich snob, and her lines in the film were great.  Yet other than that, although it was a great cast, this film, uh.... why don't we say SUCKED.  It was amazingly hard to follow, the lighting of the house that the film took place in gave me a headache, and although the ending was good, I found that I couldn't care less what happened.  Altman uses an hour and a half to build up the characters, but he has so many characters in the film that there is absolutely no character development--the audience is too confused and bored to care about breaks in the story.  In the previews to the film, we find out that the film is about a group of rich guests going to a British country home for a hunting party, and one of them is murdered.  But by the end of the film, we don't even clearly discover who the actual murderer was, and I had no clue who did it, and didn't really care, until someone told me.  On top of all that, because almost of the characters were either Scottish or British, I found it difficult to understand.  I would almost like this film more if it weren't being nominated for an Oscar, especially best picture, because a film like David Lynch's Mulholland Drive deserves an Oscar much more than Gosford Park.  I do think that Altman did a great job creating a really closed- in and claustrophobic feeling within the house, and every scene that was shot outside made me feel relieved and free from the madness of the characters within the house-yet this was Altman's genius, and for me one of the only highlights of the movie.

Black Hawk Down, Memento, Dinner Rush,  Amelie, any of those films overall provided a better satisfaction than this light dessert.  Bob Giraldi's indie pic Dinner Rush came out last year and kept on coming back to my mind as I watched Gosford Park.  (By the way, are the words Gosford Park ever said in the film?!)      The structure of Dinner Rush is actually quite similar all the action takes place at a fancy Italian restaurant in lovely Tribeca, NY, and the camera takes us between the two cultures of the upstairs guests and hosts, and the downstairs cooks and waiters panicking and struggling to make the perfect meals.  There's murder, suspense, comedy, drama, and it is perhaps an even more effective ensemble film, because the twists end up tying together various members of the cast that would otherwise have seemed wasted.  Even better, Tim Ives' cinematography easily made you feel like you were exploring a world, even though you never really left the restaurant.    You know for all the preparation of the meals and the surroundings, I never once wanted to EAT the food these people were eating (unlike Dinner Rush or Big Night.)  I mean, a film so lavish should give you some sense of longing for what these people are coming for.       I still don't get what it is about Altman.  MASH, the Player, Short Cuts (what an awful friggin' film!), and Gosford Park all illustrate a guy who's probably very well respected for making ensemble productions that allow his actors some flexibility and room for improv, but most of the time, I don't come away from his films feeling particularly awakened, tortured, or affected.  You feel like instead you've gotten to watch some actors enjoying/torturing/affecting themselves, and spend two hours living vicariously through them.    I have to admit Gosford Park has some gorgeous cinematography that deserves an Oscar nom, and the film has some very well-played performances from Emily Watson, Clive Owen, Stephen Fry, Kelly MacDonald, Maggie Smith, (though all on the small side) and as always, the facial expressions of Richard E. Grant are always good for a laugh.  However, it's not really an impressive film to me.  As a matter of fact, I came out having gotten exactly what I expected, and that wasn't much.

My usual problem with Mercant Ivory/Jane Austen/British art films is just how good these people have got it, and at the same time how little they appreciate the fact that they've got what so little in the world have.  Actually, the only character I was kind of rooting for was the plain wife (Lady Stockbridge?) of the cheating husband, who the film seemed to indicate was going to end up with the Hollywood star (Jeremy Northam), yet like so many other characters, Altman seemed to abandon this subplot in the last quarter of the film.

Those places kill more people than Dodge City on a hot day.Just such an ill-fated overnighter fills in the story around Gosford Park, Robert Altman's sharp, insightful examination of the class system and social mores of pre-war Britain.  An aging gent (Michael Gambon), who, unlike much of the peerage then and since, actually has the money to go with his title, hosts a pheasant-shooting party at his giant country estate.  Invited are various relatives, friends, enemies, hangers-on, and schemers.  There is, of course, a murder, and no shortage of nasty motives and dirty secrets that show a seamy side behind the proper setting.  The murder mystery is the engine that drives the plot, but there are numerous stories going on at once, which Altman skillfully weaves in.Mostly, the movie is a portrait of the upstairs/downstairs culture of Britain the numerous servants, cooks, valets, etc., and how they interact with those they serve (how many movies credit a Technical Advisor for Butler?).  We see the ways in which the class structure can be breached, and the ways in which it can't.  This phenomenon extends to other parts of society as well we see a police inspector (wonderfully pompous Stephen Fry) who snaps at his John-Bull constable for fretting about forensic preservation while his boss is trying to glad-hand the toffs.Surprisingly for movies of this type, Gosford Park never descends into full-throated preaching on the subject.  The points it makes are subtle, and while some of them are devastating, the movie itself does not seem to make judgements about what it shows us; that it leaves to us.  In fact, one of the striking things we learn is the way the caste system was enforced just as rigidly from the bottom as it was from the top.Much has been made about Altman's looting of top-drawer British talent for this movie, and it is all deserved there is not a bad performance in the bunch.  Especially noteworthy are Maggie Smith, as the cattiest grande dame you ever met, Emily Watson as a knowing maid, coolly unflappable Clive Owen as a secretive valet, and Kelly MacDonald as the main protagonist, a shy Scots maid whose innocence masks a sharp mind.  Even the token Yanks, Bob Balaban (who receives idea credit) and Ryan Phillippe, manage to hold their own, with Balaban especially funny as a high-stress Hollywood producer of, of all things, Charlie Chan movies.Altman juggles all this particularly well, as he tends to do with such movies, neither spending too much time on a particular sub-story or neglecting it.  His photography also does a good job contrasting the lush, fancy dining rooms with the darker basement corridors of the servants.  He throws us enough of the conventions of the drawing-room mystery to keep us entertained, but doesn't overplay it.  We see a lot of playful zooms on various bottles labelled Poison, but there is no Miss Marple gathering everyone together and pointing out that only Lord Bustle-Thwaite could possibly have known about the secret passage into the smoking-lounge, etc.The script by Julian Fellowes is crisp, witty, and consistently involving, even over two and a half hours (it's a rare mystery that takes such time getting to the actual murder).  It is packed with small, revealing moments a butler grabs a quick smoke, two maids dance in a dining hall to the music coming from the drawing room, a man of rank slips into a basement pantry to eat strawberry jam with a spoon.  The solution to the mystery is a bit on the obvious side, but still affecting.If there is a fault to the movie, it is that it is difficult to keep everyone straight and figure out who is saying what to whom about whom else.  All the characters (and there are a lot of them, dames and ladies and earls and whatnot) are introduced in a whirlwind right at the beginning; just to complicate matters, the servants are called alternately by their own names and their bosses', and everyone is also involved in their own little intrigues and storylines (this difficulty might just be me I had no trouble tracking the various grunts, snake-eaters, and mech jockeys of Black Hawk Down, but throw a couple of viscounts at me and I'm toast.)

Thus, I was a bit surprised and disappointed that I walked away from Gosford Park wondering about the point of it all.Yes, it was an excellent commentary about social class. Yes, the acting was fabulous. However, commentary and acting do not a good movie make. For starters, it was very hard to understand the dialogue in places, especially when Emily Watson was speaking at the beginning of the film. It was very jumbled and poorly edited.Secondly, where, in any of the characters, is there any display of human kindness? One might point to Trentham's maid, Mary, as an example, but even that is a stretch. Altman portrays only misery and empty lives everywhere. Two plus hours of this is more than I care to watch.And finally, if Altman wants to incorporate murder into a plot, do it justice. The introduction of a bumbling inspector was jarring to say the least. The attempt at humor at that late point in the film seems superfluous at best. The murder line drifts away in meaninglessness much like the rest of the film. At least one can give Altman high marks for consistency. 5/10.

While it does have comedic elements, and it uses the classic British country house murder mystery as a framework, it is ABOUT class, class, class. Don't condemn it because you did not have a laugh a minute. Don't condemn it because the murder is simple. Only the distinction between the classes is important, and in this the film does a wonderful job. It is not really very important to get every relationship between servants and their respective master, although understanding these relationships will help some asides and unimportant comments more enjoyable. The film probably needs to be viewed more than once for these points to be picked up. Some things that added very nice touches1) Maggie Smith's constant insults and cutting comments, usually couched in sympathetic language.2) Jeremy Northam's singing, with the adoring servants gathered out of sight in the halls, stairways, etc.3) Bob Balaban's over the top character.4) The detective as played by Stephen Fry, mirroring the usual Dame Agatha super savvy detective, missing every clue while constantly quieting his lower class sidekick who spots them.Not a film for everyone, but if you don't require simple and direct storys, and can patiently absorb the fine details, you can get a lot of subtle enjoyment from this one.

But that isn't what made me enjoy this film immensley, it was the use of several interesting characters each with their own charm and appeal.This must have been just a laborious task to make this film, there are many actors and the story gives each one a chance to get to know the audience. It seemed like this could create a chance for disaster but every actor shines.Essentialy the film is a look at class stuffed England in the 30's with the homeowners living the life of tea and crumpets, and fancy dinners, while the servants tend to their needs and whims.  Of course the servants are all privy to their gossip, but of what use is it, one of them remarks 'Why should we live our lives through them?'As the film continues eventually a guest is murdered, and a preverbiale 'Clue' scene and Agatha Christie who-dunit ensues.  But the real joy of the film is just the characters and how the murder itself releases all the secrets of everyone in this glorious huge castle setting.At one point in the film I just didn't even care who the murderer might have been, I was just so enchanted with the behavior and manners of all the people in this film even at 2 1/2 hours length.  This movie is also very funny and has some classic dialogue most of it coming from Maggie Smith as a snobish old Countess.  Eg..Countess So in your film that you are making someone gets murdered so who did it?Director Oh well I wouldn't want to tell you that would spoil the film.Countess Well I mean really, It's not like anyone here is going to see it.The film is just full of surprises, but I think a lot of American audiences will just not get it and be even confused perhaps by some of the dialogue and accents.

A delicious mix of H.H. Munro and Agatha Christie, Gosford Park isalways witty and usually very funny, working on several levels to entertain and mystify.  Since there really isn't a starring role in this wonderful ensemble, you might say that every part is a bit part, but the casting of these bits is Altman's true victory.  Every single face in the film belongs to a renowned actor or actress, filling their bit parts to bursting with amazing, sly performances.  Maggie Smith is especially delightful as a sharp-tongued snob of an over-dressed old lady, living on herfamily allowance and skewering the feelings of everyone in sight with her vicious observations.

It defies a lot of expectations, cuz&#133; well cuz Robert Altman doesn't make the movies some people want to see.  It amazes me that after Nashville, The Player, Short Cuts and M*A*S*H people who can't get Altman's almost complete emphasis on character, utter lack of sentimentalism, complexity of plot and extreme demands on the attention still accidentally wander into his films and sit through their vast length expecting something ordinary.  Complaining that none of the characters were likable in an Altman film is like complaining that there are too many explosions in a Bruckheimer film.The murder mystery is a joke, like the throwaway song at the end of Nashville, the inconsequential guilt of Griffin in The Player, or the way Donald Sutherland simply leaves the movie at the end of M*A*S*H.  Altman drags out an Agatha Chirstie scenario and then makes an anticlimax out of the murder.  It isn't a mystery who killed Sir William McCordle at all, justice isn't going to be served, and most of the cast is genuinely uninterested in finding out who did them the favor.  Since many of them are better off after he's gone, knowing anything more about his death would simply be a liability.  Altman takes the point of the old plot and tears it out in order use the setting for another one of his ensemble pieces where characters aren't defined in relation to a McGuffin or other plot element, but in relation to each other. Sir William McCordle's murder is far less important to the film than his relation to all of the women.  Altman does an incredible job of making social taboos, rules and position as real as any character.  The cinematography is elegantly mannered &#150; almost floating around characters like a ghost.  The collage of dialogue is rich and, as usual with Altman films, the actors are so thoroughly in character that every  spot on the screen has someone doing something worth watching.I wish there was a little more of Derek Jacobi though.

The best thing to do is simply go with it. Another downside to the movie, is that with the multitude of storylines, there is not a concrete resolution to more than about a handful of them.Despite that, once you learn to stop thinking of this as a traditional murder mystery (which, despite the ads, it is not) its a pretty interesting, well acted, portrayal of the dinstinctions between the classes in 1930s England. Of all the characters, though, Maggie Smith really steals the show, giving a much less restrained performance than in Harry Potter and reminding me of some of her earlier works (Evil Under The Sun in particular).Its not a mystery, at least in the traditional sense, and while it is frustrating to keep track of all the characters, it is a good character study, and fairly entertaining, with an ending which I feel is worth the wait.I give it three out of five stars.

However, the casting seems only to serve in drawing in audiences to a movie that might otherwise be overlooked as another stodgy British film.  In fact, after watching the murder mystery I came to the conclusion that the large cast hurt the film more than helped.  There are so many characters with so many different problems and gripes, that none of them, in the end, seem important.  We are never allowed to get to know anyone, not even the supposed protagonist in the film, a maid in training who solves the whole murder herself.Therein lies another criticism of the film, the plot.  My viewing companion expressed an expectation that the story would be like Twelve Little Indians, or Murder on the Orient Express.  Though the body count remained as low as that in Murder on the Orient Express, none of Agatha Christie-like wit embodied itself in Gosford Park.  The movie reveals the murderer's identity so easily that such a long and tedious movie seems superfluous.  The explanation behind the murder could have been written in a paragraph and I would have gotten as much out of it.The best part of the film is the visuals and by this, I mean both animate and inanimate.  The house and land on which it is filmed is the epitome of British upper-class living.  The 1932 costumes and the lavishly set tables are all very beautiful.  Some of the actors ain't bad to look at either. But somehow, this doesn't matter when there are other such comparable films with better stories.

It is a nicely filmed but not especially well-written episode of Upstairs, Downstairs.This is not to say the film is without its merits.  It has a sweetness to it that is often missing from Altman's work, and more surprising, a modesty that doesn't leave many of the director's characteristic fingerprints on the finished product.The assembled cast must include every talented actor with a British accent, from Hellen Mirren to Kristin Scott Thomas to Michael Gambon to Stephen Fry (Jeeves himself, as a detective).  If you are an anglophile there is much here to enjoy.As far as the story itself, I was generally bored or confused, or both, by the extremely large and not especially differentiated cast of characters. This sense of sprawling confusion only adds to the effectiveness of Altman classics like Nashville and Shortcuts because it serves as an accurate represenation of those two mileaus (Shortcuts takes place in suburban Los Angeles) and additionally supports Altman's thematic approach to the material.  Here the parade of characters seems less a function of style or theme and more the symptom of an inability on the part of the filmmakers to distill what is essentially an intimite story down to its necessary parts. It feels like Altman wasn't sure if he was satirizing the English murder mystery, or making a drawing room romance, so we end up with sub-plots heading in opposite directions, most of them destined to remain completely unresolved.  The movie ends almost with a sense of surrender to the needless complication that has been sown throughout as the guests and their servants rush to get out of town, and the theatre patrons rush to get out of their seats, all gushing the same sigh of relief  it's over.

One of Altman's specialties is having ensemble casts for his movies (Nashville, The Player, Short Cuts, Ready to Wear, Cookie's Fortune, and Dr. T and the Women are other Altman movies that feature big name casts), and he does the same thing here with Gosford Park. The movie takes place in 1932 when a rich couple invite family and friends for a hunting party weekend. We get to meet these people as well as the servants who work for the couple. Then a murder occurs, and it kind of turns into a tribute to the great mystery novelist Agatha Christie (who's stories usually took place at this time of the century). I really liked the way Altman gets you to know all the characters. There are at least 30 speaking parts in this film and everybody's given a chance to make an impression. Gosford Park is surronded by an all British cast, with the exception of Americans Ryan Phillippe and Bob Balaban. Of this big cast, Dame Maggie Smith gives the best performance in the film as an acid-tongued dowager who's the aunt of the female host (Kristin Scott Thomas). The moment when a piano playing actor (Jeremy Northam) is playing the piano, finishes up the third piece of music that he's playing and everyone applauds, Smith steps in by saying Oh no! Don't applaud and encourage him anymore! He'll just keep playing! That is a classic moment thanks to some classic bit of acting by Smith who I've always admired for a long time (she also starred in my all-time favorite mystery movie Death on the Nile from 1978), and she's really good here. I'm glad she's still around acting (she can also be seen in the recent blockbuster Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone). She's a treat to watch. Other actors who are good here besides Smith, Thomas, Northam, Phillippe, and Balaban, there's Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, Emily Watson, Derek Jacobi, Stephen Fry, Michael Gambon, Charles Dance, Richard E. Grant, Kelly MacDonald, and Eileen Atkins. Everybody's good here. Altman is now 77 years old and has never won an Oscar (he's been nominated for Best Director four times). His first Best Director nomination came over 30 years ago for his classic war comedy M.A.S.H.. Gosford Park could very well win him the Best Director Oscar come this March. If this happens, I think it would be well-deserved. Not only for this film, but for his whole career. But I'd give it to him just for his work on Gosford Park alone. It's that good of a job.

We had some difficulty with the intelligibility of dialogue early on, and there were a few peripheral characters who might well have been either cut or pared down to background--but, those minor points aside, the film was unalloyed pleasure. The performances were uniformly strong and impossible to deal with individually. I will note Maggie Smith, splendid as always and given perhaps the most generous portion of marvelous lines; Jeremy Northam, great throughout, but whose singing scene was pure gold (especially the way in which, for one moment, the entire household was welded together in a common euphoria), Derek Jacobi...but enough.

It isn't meant to be a murder mystery, or, except in an elliptical way, as pointed social commentary about class injustice. But there are elements of these things--and a great deal more. I think it's the best Altman since Short Cuts, and probably as good as Nashville.

The whole household is filled with many problems, for all the different people. The upstairs people are terrifically unhappy because they are so worried about their wealth. But, the serving staff is also a mess because there's so much gossip and duties that they don't have time to just relax and enjoy themselves. Upstairs, Sir William and his younger wife, Lady Sylvia, engage in a very relaxed lifestyle of shooting, dinners and parties, and downstairs, while the servants are downstairs and they work endlessly under the command of the butler Mr. Jennings, and the house keeper Mrs. Wilson. The poor and less fortunate are treated horribly in this film, and the motto seems to be, If you're rich you can do whatever the hell you want, but if you're poor you need to slave all day for the rich. This is an unjust way to live and treat the poor, and this movie was made to challenge our society to give them the respect they deserve. There is definitely a hierarchy in the household, especially with the cooks and those who work in the kitchen. There are many times when characters ask each other what job they held previously, and at one time one of the cooks took offense to being called a factory worker. Also, in another part of the film a servant walks through the room where all of the rich are chatting, but when he walks through everyone goes silent. This shows how poorly treated and disrespected they are in culture. A few more examples of the unjust hierarchy in this estate are that the servants' quarters have no windows, everyone sits at the dining table in order of their employers' social rank, and the maids are referred to by their masters' and mistresses' names instead of their own. The wealthiest characters in Gosford Park all have an extremely bias view on the world where they look down upon those who are less wealthy. They aren't respected as well, or treated with as much dignity. It's like the poor in our society today, because we don't value them at all. In the movie, Freddie and Isabelle are interrupted by a footman while in a conversation, and Freddie says, It's nobody. This is just another example of the dehumanizing and unjust treatment of the poor.The only concern that the wealthy characters in the film had was how to obtain more wealth. One main example in the film where money is aggressively sought after is the time when Freddie Nesbitt had finished going through his wife's money, and started an affair with McCordle's daughter, Isabelle, in an attempt to blackmail her and getting her father to find a position for him. He uses the girl because he wants more money, and like every other character in the film he's all about greed. Another example where wealth is the only focus is the time when Sir William and Lady Sylvia cut cards with one of Lady Sylvia's sisters to see who would have the money from the wealthy businessman.In the end of the movie, Sir William is murdered. The 'blame game' goes on inside the estate for quite awhile, until Robert Parks fesses up to Mary that he killed Sir William. But Mary is Parks' mother, and she knew that Parks was eventually going to kill Sir William because he had abandoned Parks at an orphanage as a child, and he abused his workers. The message Gosford Park is getting across is you can be the wealthiest man in the world, but that will not buy you happiness. Sir William was extremely wealthy, but he abused almost everyone that worked for him, and he even abused his son by leaving him to grow up at an orphanage. It all came back to get him in the end, and what we need to take away from this film is that every human being, no matter how rich or poor you are, deserves the same respect and dignity as everyone else in order to achieve a just world.HOW MANY STARS (out of 4)? 1.5 "},{"Title":"Gosford Park Dialog Difficult to Understand","Date":"25 June 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" The dialog in Gosford Park was difficult for me to understand.

I turned on the English subtitles after a while, and I enjoyed the movie more thereafter, even though I had to continue to read the subtitles throughout the movie. I do think the movie portrayed how the upper class English people viewed and treated their servants in the 1930's in an accurate manner. The servants were portrayed as being present to do one thing only, to cater to their master's every whim and wish. I did enjoy the conversations among the servants when they were away from their master's.

The problem of course is to introduce some twists into this rather old theme, such as the true relationship between the wealthy and the servants, an American film producer and a totally incompetent detective. All played in a comic way, despite the lack of jokes.What we end up with is a movie with little to say about people you just don't really care about, and of course it takes a long to say nothing.Perhaps those who were fans of those old Agatha Christie novels and movies will love this, but to me it was a lot of sauce for too little meat.

Many spoilers below...Gosford ParkFinally, a murder mystery completely devoid of intrigue, suspense or interest!It's about time somebody bad-mouthed this three-hour parade of ennui.Memo to the Academy   You you really, really blew it this time.  Was it not enough to give Robert Altman a best director nod?  Did you have to follow the critics down their misguided path as well?Where to begin?  Well, let's start with the obvious &#150; the film itself. Amazingly boring; intensely uninteresting.  The theory here is `if we put enough characters on the screen maybe no one will notice that NOT A SINGLE ONE IS WORTH STUDYING'.  Robert Altman has done this in several films.  Did you not notice?  Short Cuts immediately comes to mind.  In Short Cuts, Altman wove together thirty characters in four or five dull stories hoping that no one would notice that no single story could stand on it's own. Critics were fooled; audiences were not.There are forty-five (45!) speaking roles in Gosford Park.  For anybody who liked this film, can you tell me honestly 1. was there a single line of memorable dialogue?  2.  was there a character with whom you could spend more than five minutes and not be bored?  3.  was there a tension between any two characters great enough to explore beyond the movie's parameters? (i.e. would you care to see any of these characters interact again, ever? Did you want to follow Elsie's life in London?  Really?  Why?)The plot of the first two hours comes down to two story lines what shirt will Maggie `I'm only going to open my mouth to be abusive' Smith wear to not go hunting?  And is Ryan `Do you know how hard it is to be Max Perlich from Maverick?' Phillippe really a valet?  The answer to both questions `who cares?'This is the first film I'd ever seen in which there was hidden sex, only to find out that when we knew who was engaged in the sex, I'd rather it had stayed hidden.How do you sell this thing to an outsider?`Gosford Park is a murder mystery.' `OK, whodunit?' `The film isn't clear on that point, nor does it want to be.  The why is given, but almost no one seems to care about the whom, including the inspector.  Neither is there resolution of the crime.  There are also far too many suspects.' `So, uh, it isn't really a murder mystery.' `No.' `So, what's it about, then?' `Well, a cast of dozens, literally, goes to this big English country house for a hunting party.  It's set in the 1932.' `Why 1932?' `Theory is that it was a time of marked decline in the English empire; but such seems irrelevant.  It could have been 1732,1832 or 1992, and you'd get the same result.' `Is it about this hunting stuff?' `Not especially.  At it's core, it's about servant-master relationships.' `So, there a lot of servant-master issues going on, right?' `Sort of.  You see, while it should be about such, the servants almost all in unison get down on this one American who is playing the part of a servant without being one&#133;they obviously take pride rather than scorn at their positions.  It's an English thing.' `Ah, so we put down Americans, then.  Is it funny?' `No, not really.  There's some comic relief about a Hollywood producer of Charlie Chan films, but it doesn't really work.  There also open scorn of a notable Hollywood actor, but as the servants to a person are smitten with him, that doesn't really work either.' `The murderee deserves it, right?' `Oh, he sure does.' `So, the crime is worth the admission.' `No, it's kind of anticlimactic, too.  The violent portion is an attack on a corpse.  Also, while one can sympathize with the murder; it's hard to sympathize with any single character.  You'd have to see it to understand.' `And why would I do that? `I have no idea.'The minute I can make my own films, this English quiet-underlying tension scam tripe will be my first effort.  If these are the standards, how hard can it be to make a winner?Look, I know you think I'm joking here, but try this treatment  English castle, 1880s.  Why the 1880s?  It doesn't matter; it's all English history, therefore it was all worthy of note, apparently.  There's a love triangle between the Duke or Baron or whatever, a Noble Lady of some sort and a stable hand.  Now, meanwhile, there's some sort of conflict involving either the legitimacy of the Duke's title or the rightful owners of the Castle &#150; some sort of German royalty who have returned post marriage to reclaim an English title.  Throw in some looks at parliament, some big foofy dresses and about ten random servant characters with various stances on how they feel about royalty and you've got yourself a movie.Do you see how easy it is?  That was off the top of my head, and yet snotty English folk and Anglophiles would line up around the block to see it.BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY GOOD.  And while the plot I described is three times more involving than Gosford Park, that doesn't make it worth seeing, either.   Not without something on screen that doesn't bore you, at least.

I haven't seen any of Altman's past work.  I only know him by reputation.  He is known to be a very talented filmmaker--at least that's what most people believe--who specializes in films that contain an ensemble of characters.  Well, if I gave a damn about any of these characters, I wouldn't hold anything against Altman.  But none of these characters--except for Maggie Smith's, slightly--engaged me.  The movie is about two hours and fifteen minutes and feels like an eternity.  It's like watching a stage play--a very boring one.  The characters talk and talk and talk and talk some more.  So it is a dialogue-driven piece.  Even dialogue-driven pieces often have some visual eye candy, though not in abundance.  Anybody who has read a book on Screenwriting knows that audiences do not want to see talking heads!  OK, there are movies like American Buffalo and The Big Kahuna which are both based on plays and contain lots of talking heads, but the acting is so powerful in those movies that I didn't feel nearly as claustrophobic as I did when watching Gosford Park.  Now, the cast is definitely full of talent.  As my Dad said--and he's pretty much right--most of our greatest actors come from England.  And many of those great English actors are in this movie  Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, Kristen Scott Thomas, etc.  But their characters are so dull that they really didn't have much to work with.  But I do have to say--and this is just me--that the English accents are thick and sometimes quite hard to understand.  Of course, if this movie didn't depend too much on dialogue, I could still catch on to the story.  But since it does, I had a hard time keeping track of the story.  I was at the point where I was struggling to stay awake and about halfway through I didn't even bother trying to figure it out.  The humor is quite bland.  Once again, maybe it's just because I'm American and I don't share the English mentality.  Though I've seen a fair deal of funny English comedies, let's face it--there are always certain things that are funny to one ethnic group, and not funny to others.  So I'll give the comedy element the benefit of the doubt.  If this were an American movie and it wasn't funny--I have the right to say it's not funny.  I'd rather keep an open mind.  However, Maggie Smith has a few funny lines.  I like the scene in which Bob Balaban, who plays a hotshot Hollywood director, is about to pitch the story for his new movie, but he doesn't want to give anything away.  Smith comments, It's OK.  We're not gonna see it anyway.  I wouldn't exactly say that she deserves an Oscar for her role, but she is the one person who actually breathed some life into this film and I commend her.    This is basically supposed to be a mystery/thriller, and it could've been much more intriguing.  That's why I compare this movie to a boring, monotonous college professor giving a lecture  You know that whatever he's teaching can be fun and exciting, but it's delivered in such a deadpan fashion that no one cares to listen--or in this case, watch. Maybe the artistic quality of this film completely flew over my head; maybe not.  You be the judge.  I'm just giving my honest, unpretentious opinion.  If you want to see something deep and compelling, and keeps you interested, I suggest you buy a ticket for In the Bedroom.

Its at least 1/3 hour too long and not the 'whodunit' I was expecting.  I wish there was a 'whodunit' that gave the audience an actual chance to figure out 'who' without being a mindreader.

I guess the most important thing that comes to mind in connection with this movie is that it is NOT, NEVER ANY SORT OF DETECTIVE STORY. NEVER. In terms of prioritizing, the mystery-solving element or suspense is in the umpteenth place. It is almost completely IRRELEVANT here, because by the time something does start to happen in this flick(idle talk aside) it is way past the midpoint. I kept wondering when will it start, when will it actually start, when will somebody do something AT LAST???. But it was hopeless - a detective story it was not to be, but just a neverending sequence of idle aristocratic talk about NOTHING (plain gossip for the most part) set in some rural estate somewhere in time. On a bright side, though, is the cast - it is impressive, performances are good, natural, and believable - we must stay honest and give the makers credit for that. But again, otherwise this film is a complete waste of time, unless of course gossip, meaningless talk and details of servants' way of life is what you look for in a detective story. My mark is 3 for one and only reason - acting (the only ray of light here). Other than that it was BOREDOM epitomized.

This one tries to make itself more interesting by adding a murder plot, but it's so lame and shoddily executed it makes the movie even worse. Its chief technique is to divide the cast into the gentry in their elegant drawing-rooms and their servants in the dusty hallways beneath, which would be an original idea if it didn't happen to be the main theme of the (much superior) seventies television series Upstairs Downstairs. This device serves as an excuse for over two hours of people gossiping about each other whilst nothing happens and overrated actors ham it up with hackneyed props and eccentricities (Gambon has a spoilt dog, Dance is deaf, Fry has a big pipe, Bates is a drunk, and so on). Like all bad films, it isn't entirely without virtue - it is elegantly shot, and Mirren, MacDonald and Owen all give good performances. Based on an idea by producers Altman and Balaban, with exteriors shot at Syon House in south-west London. Unbelievably, this won an Oscar for Best Screenplay - I've read food packaging labels with more wit and storyline than this script. This movie typifies everything that's wrong with stuffy British colonial costume-dramas about toffs - it's passionless, dull as dishwater, goes on forever and looks exactly the same as every other such movie.

The DVD is superb, and one extra has interviews with several men and women who were in the service profession in England in the 1930s, and who were consultants to Altman to assure terminology and practices were portrayed authentically in the film.some SPOILERS -- Rich baron (Michael Gambon, of Longitude fame) invites a large group to his manor for a pheasant shoot the next day.

The first 2/3 of the film just introduces the customs and characters and sets up the end. The murder is committed. We correctly note that it was a poisoned drink that kills him, but we later see a knife stuck into his chest. But, as the otherwise bumbling inspector (Steven Ray of Wilde fame)notes, a dead man doesn't bleed.

Godsford Park, at least for me, is just more of the same.Though pieced together by numerous subplots (as is Altman's style), the primary story is that of a murder mystery slowly unraveling at an English manor in the 1930s. Greed and murder, and the social distinctions that perpetrate the mistrust among the guests and the servants are fine ingredients for a 'Whodunnit' in this film, but never create much suspense. Long scenes and mostly improv dialog are more like a recipe for boredom (at least in my case) and the events unfold about as slowly and anti-climatic as they would in real life. Congrats, however, to amazing art direction (both the costume and sets) which painstakingly recreates an eerie 1930s atmosphere which would have provided a tremendous setting for a more entertaining tale of corruption and deceit.Though disappointed with once again being muddled in ambiguity and tirelessly slow moving scenes for me, this may be a good film for you if you like Altman's consistency of style.

But it could (and should) have been much, much better.An 'Upstairs, Downstairs' reworking on the back of a pointless murder mystery, Gosford is as over-blown as it is over-praised. Altman's usual cinematic mechanics are all there, of course the flowing camera work, the multi-narrative tracking. But here though, that's exactly what they are mechanical. And. . . They don't work.Halfway thru the movie it's still difficult to figure out precisely who is who. Worse though, it's difficult to care, and as the script lurches downhill into one improbability after another an overwhelming sensation of boredom sets in, precipitated as much by the absence of plot credibility as character credibility there are some in this ensemble with less substance than cardboard.An overload of any element in any movie is never a good thing, and 'Gosford Park' plainly bears it out the cream of British acting may be present, but it's a cream that pretty soon curdles.At the end, then, one is drawn to the conclusion that the work of Altman and his collaborators is uncomfortably close to its subject matter, because the eponymous Gosford Park is, in British parlance, a stately pile, slowly mouldering away. . .As, indeed, is the movie.

Undoubtedly if anyone but Robert Altman had perpetrated this film, it would have immediately fallen into oblivion.  A group of dreadfully uninteresting people gather at a 1930s English country manor, where the gossip is only momentarily halted by murder.  The film was marketed as a slightly comedic whodunnit, but there is nary a laugh to be had and the whodunnit seems almost an afterthought.  Even the view of social mores and how the working class were forced to vicariously live through the scandal provided by their betters feels like warmed-over Upstairs Downstairs.  Altman fans will probably be rabid in its defense, but there is really no legitimate reason for its being.  While it is somewhat amazing that Altman is able to introduce so many characters and keep a multi-tiered narrative from falling into total confusion, he has managed to do this in far more compelling films.  It takes virtually an hour to figure out who is who and by that point we realize that we would not want to know any of these people.  When the murder finally occurs, the characters are so unimpressed that there is no reason for the viewer to care either.  Incredibly, the older actors come off worse than the younger.  Clive Owen, Kelly McDonald and Ryan Phillipe (usually horrible) are decent in ill-defined roles.  Emily Watson provides the only full-bodied performance of the lot as a wronged maid.  Veterans like Alan Bates, Richard E. Grant and Derek Jacobi, among others, are virtually wasted.  Stephen Fry shows up two-thirds in as a bumbling inspector and not only seems to have walked on-set from another film altogether, but is embarrassingly bad to boot.  Of the Oscar nominees, Helen Mirren's nod is puzzling since she virtually plays an automaton for the duration of the film as a stoic head housekeeper, and Maggie Smith's acid-tongued shrew is surprisingly joyless and downright obnoxious.  The film fails as social commentary, fails at drama, fails at comedy and fails at mystery.

Look, I don't need an action film here, but even Merchant-Ivory films have some tense undercurrents that one can relate to.  This is the first film since Accidental Tourist in which, in retrospect, I'd wished I'd slept through.  (And that includes Pearl Harbor).Now the big question, voters why did you nominate this film for best picture?  You know that there are standards involved here.   What were you people thinking?  Let me guess.  The critics loved it.  That they did. Why? Who can say?  Robert Altman has become the Bob Dylan of movies  if you're a rebel long enough, apparently, you turn into an icon.  It doesn't make your crap any better, it just makes it `legitimate'.  Do something remotely mainstream, and people hurl awards at you, like Clint Eastwood for Unforgiven.  The English loved it.  Well, of course they did, but is that an excuse?  There's servants, there's masters, there's random English history, there's put downs of Americans and American culture.  What more would an Englishman want?The selection of Gosford Park for Best Picture represents the absolute worst of such selections overlong, over involved and yet curiously standoffish and without tension, stuffy, set in another era for no apparent reason. It's like this garbage contains all of the nominated clich√©s, without any of the things that make Best Pictures worth the nomination.You don't seem to realize the implications here &#150; every year, generally, there are about one to three truly outstanding pictures to fill five Best Picture slots.  (Last year there were zero, but that's another story.) Take this year for example  the odds that either Lord of the Rings or Beautiful Mind will take Best Picture are about 95%.  After that, it's a matter of taste.  The remaining three fill two purposes 1.  They give that Chariots of Fire hope to films that should be just happy for the nomination, but more importantly, 2. they send a message from Academy to Hollywood that tells what kind of films we'd like to see more often.Last year was a perfect case in point &#150; Traffic and Gladiator were considered the heavys.  Erin Brockovich, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Chocolat were fillers.  Not a single one of the five was a great film, which only further illustrates the point that such is a forum for voters to send messages to Hollywood.  Erin Brockovich, the blandest offering, was clearly the benchmark here.  This film was not even Steven Soderbergh's best work of 2000; it stood no chance of getting the Best Picture award.  But do you see the statement it makes?  There were several other films in the Brockovich category good, not great &#150; Cast Away, Almost Famous, You Can Count on Me, O Brother Where Art Thou?, Wonder Boys.   Even now, if you made the claim that any one of these was the actual nominee, only the `Beat the Geeks' movie guy will call you on it.  What do you get out of Erin Brockovich?  Well, you make the statement that you'd like to see stronger women's roles, more David v. Goliath stories and more happy endings in Hollywood.  You see how that works?This was a down year for film.  That all is very clear.  But that doesn't make this right; there were other choices.  You picked Moulin Rouge!, a pick that makes the disturbing statement that John Leguizamo actually contributed to a Best Picture nominee.  The direction was all over the map and the cuts were relentless, but at least that film was something new.   Look at the other available choices Memento, The Royal Tenenbaums, Amelie.  These all received writing nominations, so you guys obviously liked them.  Think of what a far superior statement you make in giving one of these films the nod. You don't have to go for the obvious also-rans either.  You could have selected the insipid Shrek, or Waking Life, a film just about 1,000 times more fascinating than Gosford Park.You didn't have to go obvious and you didn't have to appease Robert Altman with anything more than an undeserved Best Director nomination.Even if you loved it,you must admit Gosford Park is clearly the blandest Best Picture of 2001; the Erin Brockovich of the 74th awards.  So what message are you sending here?  `We want more movies with dozens of amorphous characters, little plot and only underlying screen tension, but no real conflict.'  What a message.  Shame on you.Look, IT IS OK TO HATE THIS FILM.  It wasn't that good.  You don't have to give in to the English or critics.Oh, and the choices of Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren for nominations couldn't be less inspired, but that's another issue.One star.

What most of them had in common was their speech delivery, a combination of mumbling and slurred speech that was impossible to follow even with the theatre microphones turned up to a painfully loud volume. As is typical of the modern British movie, the first 20 minutes failed to grab my attention and failed to clarify plot development. Most of the story was told in narrative fragments inserted throughout the movie, with very little important action taking place on screen. Because the dialogue was not understandable on this side of the Atlantic, or at least by me, I could not follow the plot.There are occasional recent British made movies that can be understood on this side of the Atlantic, but they are the exception. It is even rarer to find a recent British movie that grabs the viewer's attention at the start as the 1947 Great Expectations with John Mills and Hitchcock's 1940Rebecca do.

Like Short Cuts this film has a large cast of central characters who speak in a very naturalistic low-key way, often talking over the babble of characters in the background.I don't know whether to blame it on my cheap home set-up but, unlike Short Cuts, I found the dialogue hard to follow - particularly during the first half of the film. Naturally this hampers your enjoyment, especially in a film such as this which is very focused on speech.Without wanting to give anything away, following the first half of the film there is an event which gives you cause to reflect on the motivations of all the characters. This was clearly a problem for me, having been unable to make out a good deal of the early dialogue.However, I did feel at the end - and I'm sure this would be true even with the benefit of a full appreciation of the early story - that the film was rather flat. It's beautifully shot with a wonderful period feel. Another Altman trademark is the shot that makes you a voyeur or stalker witnessing people going about their business blissfully unaware that you're looking on. But these perhaps add to a sense that things are simply too played down and uninvolving. It's all very quiet.In Shortcuts the action is much more engaging and the characters more fiery, so the devices that play it down give you a feeling that you are witnessing real people in real drama.

I'm afraid I still don't know a butler from a valet from a footman from a groom from a bootleboy.  I DID learn though that these distinctions were very important at a particular time and place in England.  The TV guide gave this quite a good ranking so I looked forward to seeing it.

I was still trying to figure out who was who.  Snippets of information didn't help that much.  Wisecracks weren't very funny, and the characters essentially uninteresting.  I am glad, though, that Emily Watson came up with that daring interruption while serving dinner to these aristoi.  At least it got everyone's attention for a moment.  (I'd never realized before just how much she resembles Sarah Miles.) Okay.  There is a background story about a Charlie Chan movie about to be produced by Bob Balaban, a gay Jew whose presence in a stifling atmosphere like this is refreshing.  He has the best lines.  On the phone to colleagues in California, he keeps telling them things like, Alab Mowbray is just right.  He's a valet, isn't he?  I'm telling you, all these people here speak with English accents! I should also mention a shooting party of tweedy upper-class British twits.  I don't know how many times we've seen it.  The Rules of the Game, yes, and The Hunting Party, and a smidgeon in Straw Dogs.  A familiar enough setup to be parodied outrageously in a Monty Python film in which the hunters stagger around giggling and firing shotguns at each other and at a dozen rabbits tied to the sod. The first hour in a Charlie Chan movie moves expediciously through its handful of suspects.  They're all one-dimensional stereotypes.  The first hour of this movie introduces so many multi-layered individuals representing so many backgrounds the viewer feels he's been gazing for too long at one of those impossible Picasso's in which you see ten sides to every character.  Or maybe staring for too long at an Archimides spiral.  What a waste of time and talent.But, the murder.  Ah, the murder.  The victim is murdered twice, as he might be in a Christie mystery.  That's about the only resemblance.  This inspector is no Charlie Chan.  He's very tall, with a heavy jaw, and bumbles into every scene.  When he tries to introduce himself he is constantly interrupted by the snobs who treat him like one of the servants (whereas he really more closely resembles an alien in this milieu).  His sargent frequently points out clues which the Inspector dismisses -- They have someone who cleans those things up.  Not only doesn't he find out who the murderer is, but he packs up with his assistant and leaves, half an hour before the movie comes to its rather anticlimactic end.  Nobody pays any attention to the murder or the victim anyway.  The whole incident more or less disappears into the same narrative mist that obscures the rest of the film.

I would suggest that a potential viewer should be aware that this movie does not deliver the goods, i.e. it's extremely boring.  Ending without something positive is not recommended, so I must emphasize the extreme talent of the director in completing such a movie without loosing his ambition through the process.

I think we were all expecting a classic whodunnit perhaps along the lines of The cat and the canary (1939).Sadly, what you get is mish-mash of stories all paced to simply drag along. The sets are great, the performances are fine (Maggie Smith in particular) but there's a definite lack of focus here. I noticed from the credits that the film came from an idea by Robert Altman and another and then the story was actually written by a third person. Maybe this explains it?If you're looking for mystery, don't bother. If you want to see some period sets, visit a stately home.

Granted, it was my first experience watching a Robert Altman film, and knowing that Altman is known for his large ensemble cast movies, I should have expected this. However, Altman being the accomplished film director that he is, I'm sure even Altman could have given me reasons to care about the characters, their backgrounds, their relationships, or anything else. He failed miserably.The only real glimmer of hope in this movie comes in the form of Steven Fry's dim-witted investigator. However, he enters into the mix far too late in the film, and for me, far too late to really garner any interest I might have lost. Maggie Smith manages to slip in the occassional sharp-tongued one-liners, but they are way too few and too far between. Ryan Phillipe was just annoying, plain and simple. Everyone else was your typically stuffy English, save for the equally annoying film producer from California who wouldn't shut up or go away. By the half-way point of the movie, I was wishing he'd be the murder victim.

This movie is NOT a comedy by any stretch of the imagination.  Memento literally had more laughs than this movie-3 solid ones (when Leonard says I'm chasing this guy...no wait, he's chasing me, when he kicks the guy in room 9 instead of 6, and when he finds out he's being charged for 2 hotel rooms).

It takes well over an hour for the murder to even take place, and then everything was so predictable, even the final twist.  I've heard this movie compared to Agatha Christie by so many sources; well I loved And Then There Were None and Witness to the Prosecution and IMHO to mention this in the same breath as Christie IS A TRAVESTY!Given that the movie has no value as a comedy, a character study, or a murder mystery, what is it?  I guess it was a chance for Robert Altman to have his trademark brilliant overlapping dialogue with many British characters in a thoughtful (read SLOW) movie and show what an artist he truly is.  Apparently in his case that's enough for a barrage of Top 10 lists and year end awards, as well as for Roger Ebert to be throwing a temper tantrum saying This guy is 74 years old and he's never won an Academy Award!

The surprise revelations which keep coming at us at snail's pace are stock elements of any Agatha Christie novel (the identity of the murderer, the reason for the murder, the relationships between all the people involved, down to the very identities of the perpetrators). The acting is uneven (the American butler is particularly atrocious, while Helen Mirren is outstanding); Stephen Fry as the bumbling inspector is an embarrassing and jarring sight, completely out of place; none of the dialogue is particularly witty (does anybody seriously think Maggie Smith's supercilious, mean-spirited remarks deserve any points for being clever?). And none of the people are in any way convincingly drawn, the servants as little as the masters - take the final scene with Helen Mirren, for instance, which I'm sure is meant to leave us gasping in wonder, pity and understanding. To me, that scene summed up what was wrong with the movie a character doing and saying something that was completely out of her style, so that we could have a nicely resolved ending.Oh, and did I mention that all the characters involved are stock figures as well (the Bitchy Trophy Wife, the Devoted Butler, the Upstart Ambitious American, the Poor Grasping Relations, the Conniving Rich Man, the Ingenue Servant etc.)? This is what Robert Altman, who gave us Nashville and The Player has come down to? Sic transit gloria mundi. Perhaps he should have stopped directing after Ready to Wear (which was almost as bad as Gosford Park.) It is interesting to note, however, that the American public (including movie reviewers) still imbues anything vaguely English and aristocratic with intellectualism, artistic merit and a whiff of exoticism.

The plot is centred on the moral justification of parricide and to a lesser extent on the coverup of the homicidal avengement by the parricidal victim mother. These aberrations derive from cliche of well known origin whereby in the son's distorted feelings the father is guilty of vile egoism whereas the mother's (or rather The Mother's) own pursuit comes over as saintly altruistic. In the depraved fantasy of the parricidal maniac the Mother figure is held so highly that her earthly presence is unconceivable (let alone under the same roof and at the services of a tyrannical father) only heaven itself seems a worthy sanctuary. The poor son can only presume her having died out of heart break for the very loss of her child. The son's understandable resentment is focused solely on the father without even considering the slightest blame on the Mother. The saintly MUM does have the decency however of never revealing herself thereby avoiding her son's disappointment. The moral of the film takes for granted that the carnal union which gave birth to the parricidal maniac is the result of the disgusting habits of the father and that the mother's innocence was taken advantage of due to her state of need bringing upon her the suffered loss of her chastity. A moral both obscene and stereotype which the film nonetheless thrusts out at its audience without any second thoughts in the knowledge that it will encounter their complacent  and dishonest approval anyway.

I can't comment on the last 1 hour and 18 minutes; but I will say this much the first hour is the most boring and pointless hour of movie I've seen since Pearl Harbor. I was just sitting there, ready to yell at the screen Look, if you're going to have a murder, have a murder already. It was kind of obvious when they show you a jar with poison written on it, that yeah, someone's gonna die. Also it has this problem of having way to many characters. For example they had two tables of characters (one table had the guest, the other had the servants).Now I don't mind movies that are talky; but if the people are gonna say something; say something interesting. Driving Miss Daisy was good at it, yes it was very talky; but the dialog was well written and I could relate to the characters. Basically, it needs more editing; cut down the running length so that I won't have to sit there for an hour waiting for stuff to happen. One hour of talking heads isn't character development, it's boring. In the end, I couldn't care less about a bunch of snobby English people bantering on and on.

A good film HAS to have good dialogue, especially when it bills itself as a murder mystery. If you cannot hear half of the dialogue, how are you supposed to figure out what is going on? I think people who like this movie think this is being artistic. There is nothing artistic about a bunch of gibberish that may or may not mean anything because the director wants you to not hear it. It didn't make sense.What reviewer said earlier that a good film doesn't have to have a story? If you want a story read a book. WHAT??? If a movie has no story, it will be incomprehensible. This movie is a great example of scenes just spliced together with no regard for character development or continuity.Additionally, although we have a great cast, the movie never really goes anywhere. It wanders about from scene to scene, leaving the audience to wonder if there is a point to it all. Nothing is engaging about this movie.It is not interesting or thrilling. What a sorry excuse for a mystery. I have always enjoyed British mysteries in movie form, but this one leaves much to be desired. Many who have commented on this movie said they were bored.

However, the flaw with this film is not so much the slower pace but the actual story lines--there are too many and they are a mess trying to keep them straight.  It eventually boils down to a case of he-said-she-said.  Not pretty.  The stories were not tight and there were too many plot holes to keep track.What also takes away from the movie is the sound quality.  Somehow all the voices don't sound clear which makes it difficult to understand what is happening with the rest of the movie of which was understood.  I eventually had to turn on the captions on my DVD to follow along.On the positive side though, the movie was true to the period and vastly authentic.
