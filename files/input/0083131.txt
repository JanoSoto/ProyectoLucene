It is also one of those films that made me become the film lover that I am today. I know films like Star Wars and it's two sequels, First Blood and Rambo, Jaws and it's sequel, Halloween, Back To The Future, Ghostbusters, Raiders and it's sequels and Stripes ( there are many others but this review has to be under 1000 words )taught me the beauty of how a movie can make you feel. And Stripes was the first movie that me and my best friend at the time ( Gary ) ever memorized word for word. And I think that it is this movie that established Murray, Ramis and even guys like Candy and John Laroquette as comedians. It also has a small role for Bill Paxton in it somewhere. It was also a great stepping stone for the three amigos ( Murray, RAmis and Reitman ) to get funding for a bigger project like Ghostbusters. And if you were an executive at Columbia you would probably hand them a blank cheque for that project after seeing this film. Simply put this film is a classic in every sense of the word.Stripes tells the story of how John Winger and Russell Ziskey ( Murray and Ramis respectively ) are two losers in life. Winger is an inept cab driver that hates his job so much that he throws his keys off the city bridge one day while driving an annoying lady to the airport. Ziskey is a terrible English as a second language teacher. And he is so inept that he tries to get is class to sing songs during class as their lesson.  I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still  Ziskey sings, and his class responds  da do da da da da da da da do da da da da,  and the he congratulates them and dismisses them until next week.After Winger informs Ziskey that in the last three hours he has lost his job, his car, his apartment and his girlfriend, they decide to join the army. And then all hilarity breaks loose. It is here that we meet an assorted cast of hooligans and misfits that add to the enjoyment of the movie.You have Ox ( Candy ) as an overweight guy who thinks the army is a perfect place to lose weight for free. There is Francis Sawyer, but everyone calls him Psycho, as a nut that thinks he is in Vietnam or someplace. You also have Cruiser, who joined the army because his father and brother were in the army and also because he thought he should join before he got drafted. Then there is Elmo, who is played by a pre-Fast Times Judge Reinhold. He is a wasted jolly stoner who is jjst looking to get stoned. Why he is joining the army is a little perplexing, but really, who cares? He is fun to watch so little details like this are overlooked. And of course we have Sgt. Hulka played with absolute earnestness by the late great Warren Oates. Needless to say, it is an interesting bunch of characters.The film works for various reason, but mainly because Ramis and Dan Goldberg have written a hilarious script that puts the misfits through one twistedly funny situation after another. If only the army were this fun, everyone would want to enlist.The first half of the film works because of the basic training scenes. The second half works because the misfit recruits are assigned to protect a secret R.V. that the army has concocted. Winger and Ziskey of course can't stay bored for long and they take the R.V. out for a run to Austria to go pick up their girlfriends.Stripes is one of the funniest movies ever made and it should be checked out by younger people that were born after 1980. I was about 12 when I saw this and my dad laughed at this just as much as I did. And if all you have to go on for comedy is things like Waterboy and Big Daddy ( very funny movies in their own right ) you are missing some great older comedy. You should really check this out.

He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, I think your ready for the Special Olympics! Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, You speak some English? The student answers back SOB and $hit and the whole class than repeats it.The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable Ox. There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do. rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6.

But Stripes is a classic comedy that paved the way for such modern films, and fans of Bill Murray should check it out.As a kid, I used to watch this movie over and over. My friend and I would rewind the scene where the guys were sitting in the barracks telling each other their stories about why they joined the army. This scene is one of my all-time favorites in any comedy I've ever seen.Murray's performance is vintage in this film. He is awesome as a smart-alec loser who you just have to root for because of his charm and sense of humor and his ability to not care about anything at all. Ramis is also very good as Murray's best friend; the two have great chemistry together.Anyone who has ever been in the military will find this movie hilarious. The film does a great job with all the secondary characters such as Ox (John Candy), Elmo (Judge Reinhold), Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates, and Psycho (Conrad Dunn). The two MPs played by PJ Soles and Sean Young are also sexy and great.With its 1970s/80s humor and its classic soundtrack, this movie is probably not something anyone under 30 would enjoy. If you like Bill Murray or have been in the military, then you should give this one a look. Rating 8 of 10 stars.

The film is in a long line of service comedies that date all the way back to Charlie Chaplin's Shoulder Arms and further than that. Even Shakespeare found some humor in army life, just read how Falstaff made do in the service of his king.Of course Falstaff wasn't a drill sergeant like Warren Oates who had a platoon of underachievers with the likes of Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, and John Candy as recruits. As is usual the service comedies make a mistake in that the basic training company stays intact with the same sergeant. In real life Oates would have taken a drink when the eight weeks was done and gone on to some fresh young trainees.But some brain in the Pentagon decides that what a new type urban assault vehicle needs is some fresh recruits to maintain it, reasoning if the vehicle is worthy it can stand up to goofballs. The vehicle looks like your ordinary average camper, in fact Murray and Ramis while they're guarding it decide it would be a great chick magnet. So they pick up a pair of female MPs in P.J. Soles and Sean Young. The officer in charge is John Larroquette who isn't much better than the recruits he has and when the vehicle turns up missing, he sounds the general alarm worthy of the Captain in Mister Roberts. He leads the whole troop after Murray and Ramis right into at that time Communist Czechoslovakia and some nasty Russians. Good thing they didn't have their A team playing either.Stripes is your typical armed service comedy with a nice Eighties twist from Bill Murray and a crew from Saturday Night Live just coming into their prime as players. John Larroquette is the best in the film, imagine ADA Dan Fielding in an army uniform and you got Larroquette's character. You notice the New York County DA's office never gives Fielding any really big cases to handle.And yes that vehicle can withstand anything and it has more tricks than James Bond's Astin-Martin. To see what and how much, you have to watch Stripes.

So what's a guy to do after that, but join the Army?  But he doesn't go alone, oh no-- he also talks his best friend, Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) into joining with him.  And just like that they find themselves at boot camp, face to face with one of the most formidable Drill Instructors every to grace the silver screen, Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates), and surrounded by as motley a group of raw recruits as anyone could imagine.  Among them, there's Dewey Oxburger (John Candy), known as `Ox,' who plans to emerge from boot camp a `lean, mean fighting machine'; and `Cruiser (John Diehl),' who joined up to beat the draft (Hulka  `Son, there isn't a draft, anymore.'  Cruiser  `There was one?'); and Francis Soyer (George Jenesky), known as `Psycho' (`Call me Francis, and I'll kill you.  Touch my stuff, and I'll kill you.  Touch me...and I'll kill you.'  Hulka  `Lighten up, Francis...').	The pressure is on for Hulka and his men, when Colonel Glass (Lance LeGault) informs Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) that the `General' is looking for a squad of crack new recruits to man a special project, and Hulka's boys have been chosen.  The project involves a secret weapon, an `urban assault' vehicle, that is to be unveiled on their base in Germany shortly.  But first, Hulka has to get his troops through basic, which will be a minor miracle in itself, even though Winger goes `Out on a limb,' and offers to be their leader.  And things proceed just as badly as you would expect, not only on the obstacle course, but off, when Winger and Ziskey get mixed up with a couple of female M.Ps., Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young), and Ox gets coerced (by Winger, of course) into taking part in a female mud-wrestling event at a local night spot.  	Along the way, Reitman sets up the situations for some serious laughs, and keeps it all on track with a good pace and excellent timing.  Murray is terrific as Winger, with a performance that puts a generous helping of `dry' in the expression `dry humor.'  He plays it all so straight, so serious, from his quips and one liners (watching a TV promo for the Army, `This looks pretty good--'), to his full blown inspirational speech to the troops on the night before their final test at basic training (`We're all very different people.  We're not Spartans, we're not Watusi, we're Americans, with a capital &#145;A.'  That means our forefathers were thrown out of every decent country in the world--'), that it makes it all the more hilarious.  He never tries to be `funny,' or fish for laughs, which is really what makes this movie work so well.  Murray is perhaps the best in the business at playing this kind of humor and putting it across (Ben Stiller would be a close second).  	Harold Ramis and John Candy also make invaluable contributions that make this one fly.  Watch Ramis, reacting to what Candy is saying as `Ox,' as explains why he joined the Army; it makes what Ox is saying twice as funny.  And Ox, talking about what a `shy guy' he is, and how `You may have noticed, I have this weight problem--'  And Oates, as well, gives a singular performance that makes Hulka a real person, beyond the typical stereotype of the hard-nosed D.I.  His portrayal, taken out of context, is one that would stand up even in more serious fare, like Kubrick's `Full Metal Jacket.'	The supporting cast includes Judge Reinhold (Elmo), John Voldstad (Stillman's Aide), Roberta Leighton (Anita), Antone Pagan (Hector), Fran Ryan (Dowager in Cab), Dave Thomas (M.C.) and William Lucking (Recruiter).  From beginning to end, `Stripes' is a fun-filled laugh riot that's filled with memorable scenes and a plethora of lines you'll be quoting forever.  This is one you can watch over and over again, with a bunch of characters you're never going to forget.  Winger and Ziskey, Ox, Psycho, Cruiser.  These are the guys who Demi Moore, as Galloway in `A Few Good Men,' could have been talking about when, in response to the question of why she likes these guys so much, replies, `Because they stand on a wall, and they say nothing is going to hurt you tonight, not on my watch...'  It kind of makes you think.  Or, as Cruiser might say, `Yeah...  About what?'  I rate this one 10/10.

Well, the verdict is in and Stripes is a bad movie.Now, Stripes may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but its still a bad movie.Why is it bad? Mostly because Stripes is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as Anchorman which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.Stripes further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis's lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in Stripes revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you don't find that character funny (like I didn't) you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in Stripes funny either.Stripes is very much a movie of its era, it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80's buddy comedy I would recommend Stir Crazy. Like Stripes the humor in Stir Crazy is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike Stripes it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable.

But here come the downsides, overall I just didn't find it funny. The script does have weaknesses feeling rather sporadic and ramshackle in the laughs, complete with jokes that feel forced and flat, and while the story starts off well the second half has a change of tone into a kind of a very generic action film that jarred with the rest of the movie and some scenes especially the mud-wrestling match and any scene involving PJ Soles and Sean Young that fell short on credibility. Oates is great, the other acting isn't that good in my opinion, Bill Murray plays a very obnoxious and unlikeable character and unfortunately he isn't very funny which is sad, Harold Ramis' character is interesting but is rarely built upon, both John Candy and Judge Reinhold with some weak scenes and dialogue are dull sadly and the best said about John Laroquette the better.

It's really a low point in the line of SCTV and SNL influenced and/or inspired films begun in the 1970s. Probably, the reason is that filmmakers did nothing out of the ordinary with an overused storyline. Many Second City segments are funnier - compare, for example, the SCTV English for Beginners skit with Mr. Ramis' opening scene.

It IS a funny movie and it IS moderately entertaining but, compared to so many other movies in his canon, it's also one of the weaker Bill Murray vehicles. However, a weaker Bill Murray vehicle can still be a lot more fun than an average movie starring someone less personable in the lead role.Murray plays a lovable loser who, after a particularly disastrous time in his life, enlists in the army and also persuades his best friend (Harold Ramis) to enlist at the same time. Once there, they realise that they're in for one hell of a difficult ride. Other recruits include John Candy and Judge Reinhold while the great Warren Oates is on hand to shout everyone down as Sergeant Hulka. And let's not forget the two female military police officers played by P.J. Soles and Sean Young. You just know that, amongst this lot, you'll always end up rooting for the underdog and it's just a matter of time until Murray finds himself gaining the upper hand once more.Really, this movie is simply based around the concept of throwing Murray into the army. Fortunately, that's good enough for plenty of chuckles and goodwill. The movie is surprisingly sedate in places, content to eke out it's wisecracks and big laughs while also developing a bunch of characters you can come to genuinely like spending time with. Okay, things never stay within the realms of believability for too long (the passing out parade, the whole RV episode, etc) and certain character turnarounds are also hard to swallow but it's all good fun and potters along pleasantly enough.We all know by now that director Ivan Reitman moved on to much better things involving both Murray and Ramis but this film holds up well as a first look at that burgeoning relationship and the easygoing chemistry already in place. I'd also have to admit that many other people love this film much more than I do even though I don't actively dislike it. Personally, I think it could have done so much more with the raw material but what it provides is undemanding, inoffensive, endearing cheekiness. Which is, arguably, the essence of Bill Murray's on screen persona.See this if you like Combat Academy, Buffalo Soldiers, Sgt. Bilko.

The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails.You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training.The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them.Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten. "},{"Title":"Shockingly bad.

There's barely a laugh in the picture (Candy made me chuckle once in a great while), and the heroes are such unlikeable douches you almost can't wait to see them courtmartialed for their hilarious antics (of course it ends with them receiving medals for actions which, I imagine, would have begun WWIII in 1981). Just awful.

Harold Ramis made his first joint appearance here with Murray and I must say that they make a pretty good team. Many of their collaborative efforts like the 2 Ghostbusters movies and the Ramis-directed Groundhog day was simply shear hilarity. However, Stripes is not nearly as easy to sit through as those marvels. I don't know what it is but it seems that this kind of material has always been beneath both Murray and Ramis. If every major player in this film hadn't made better films than this one you would probably have forgotten about it in little time.There are some vaguely familiar faces scattered across every minute of this film. John Diehl from Miami Vice plays a rather dimwitted character, as does Judge Reinhold from Beverly Hills Cop. Then there is of course the great John Candy who was a little bit embarrassed to do one particular scene with a pair of not so dressed women but of all the supporting players he is the one who makes the most of what he is given here. Last but not least there is Warren Oates as the gruff but kind of decent Sgt. Hulka. He has his greatest moment when he tells the totally idiotic character Psycho to lighten up. Oh, and I almost forgot the love interests of Ramis and Murray who are quite good looking but never rises above their decorative parts. It is funny to think that Sean Young as one of the ladies was completely forgotten after only 10 years in the movies, especially when she lost two choice roles in the 2 first Batman movies.There is not much more to say than this is only entertaining in the first part of the movie, mainly because there are so many great one-liners from Murray but the whole second part involving a missing tank falls flat because this is not War Games and to make this into something that it's not is just a shame.

His character stole a weapon (an RV? come on...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally.

And yet it left me disappointed; it's not poor, exactly, just lacklustre in comparison to other '80s comedy hits like CADDYSHACK, GHOSTBUSTERS or the later PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES.The problem with the film is twofold; there's a scattershot approach to the narrative which means that it drags in various places (particularly in the last third, which descends into meaningless action out of place with the earlier comedy), and in addition the script just isn't that funny. It's just going through the same kind of jokes as in CARRY ON SERGEANT, made some 34 years previously, with some added T&A to spice things up.The best thing about the production is unsurprisingly the cast, headed by an on-form Bill Murray. Harold Ramis is predictably decent, and there's a nice role for John Candy before he adopted the lovable goof character of later years. PJ Soles and Sean Young are here too, but I found their characters annoying, getting in the way of the army situation. Warren Oates looks a bit battered but it's still good to see him in one of his final roles.

Although I didn't expect to see a masterpiece I had the feeling I could look forward to two hours of humor and relaxation. In fact the cast (beside Ramis there are Bill Murray, John Candy and Warren Oates) was promising. As were the first couple of minutes. Everything goes wrong in the life of John Winger (Bill Murray), within a couple of hours he loses his job, his apartment, his car and his girlfriend. Out of total frustration he decides to join the army together with his friend Russell (Harold Ramis). From that moment the film doesn't escape the depth of Police Academy for example. What's supposed to be a comedy dives into a vulgar and tedious movie. When the squadron enters a nudie bar on their free evening the film reaches a low point where I have to admit that I seldom saw a more embarrassing and vulgar scene which is meant to be funny and titillating. From the moment that the action moves to the East Bloc the film turns to ridiculous. Of course the film isn't meant to be art house but the talents of the cast are completely wasted here. From later collaborations between Murray and Ramis we learn that they are capable of creating a really humorous movie but this is total crap.

The two main characters, John and Russell see no point in living life like lazy sleezeballs so they join the military for some fun. This is where the stupidity starts.John and Russell and put in a recruit squad including other morons. Sgt. Hulka is the typical hard-ass drill instructor who seems to always be punishing the two main characters for trying to act funny and cool (obvious cliché). There are many instances in this movie that I found completely ridiculous. The first one would have to be basic training when the recruits are with the mortars and accidentally almost kill Hulka which results in him just being hospitalized. The recruits don't really receive any punishment (like kicked out or court martial) but strong resentment from Hulka. Secondly would have to be when John and Russell are found breaking military law which obviously causes two female MPs to magically fall in love with them, sneak into an officers nearby house, and immediately have sex. Sexist and disgusting? Check.When the recruits realize that they are pretty much idiots, and graduation is coming soon it serves as a time for John to finally act like a leader. This sounds good that they may actually take the army seriously, but they don't. John makes some stupid over-patriotic speech about how We are in the U.S. Army, the best army ever. We've been *kicking ass for over 200 years* (lol; don't you remember the Korean War and Vietnam, John?). Anyhow, this speech encourages the recruits to then do a one-night transformation for the next day which is graduation. They show up at the ceremony late, marching in like a bunch of kindergartens, and do a completely awkward, and un-military like march singing pop songs. This is supposedly their one night transformation. Yet even with this stupid display, the high ranking officers pick John and his recruits over EVERY OTHER RECRUIT PLATOON which acted more military than they did. They are sent to a NATO country on a special assignment which is testing a new EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle (in reality a GMC motor home lol!).This assignment is too much for Russell and John, and they decide to go to Germany by stealing the EM-50 UAV to meet up with the pretty female MPs they screwed with back in the U.S. Sgt. Hulka finds out what John and Russell did, and take the other recruits to retrieve the EM-50 motor home back. Somehow, they take a wrong turn into Czechoslovakia and are captured by the occupying Soviet Army. Russell, John, and the MP girls go to Czechoslovakia to rescue the men. This movie tries to portray how easy it is for American troops to invade a Soviet-bloc nation by just smashing through a roadblock. Not to mention, these idiots could have started World War III for their dumb actions! Russell, John, and the MPs enter the town the recruits are held in, rescue them, defeat a huge army of Soviet soldiers, blow up tanks, and survive rockets and grenades all thanks to the GMC Motor Home being super protective (okay?). They all then return back to the United States being heroes and calling the Soviets pu--ies which is an over-exaggeration because how could a motor home beat an entire Soviet division? Pro-American anti-Soviet propaganda is why, then again this film was made 3/4 way through the Cold War.I do not recommend this movie, it is boring, absurd, and ridiculous. If you like watching a film where buffoons become heroes in an unreal way, then this is for you.

John Candy - the legend, the big man making a little part very huge, again he is excellent (especially in poker sequence). He steals every scene he's in, gotta love the guy. Elmer Berstein creates an excellent and hugely memorable score, my favorite has to be the tune behind johns girlfriend leaving. Looking across all the tunes elmer created, his legacy is them, most definitely. The chap playing Sgt Hulka is also excellent. Makes a lot of his character. Drill Instructors are definitely like this guy. I should know! I can watch this until the cows come home, well worth a look if you like SNL, Candy, Ramis, Murray.OK, I've now seen the extended cut. And wow is that a different (and better!) movie. The whole extra scene in John's girlfriends apartment about the Winnibago which adds more to John's motivation to actually join The Army. Every time I watch this I totally fail to notice Sean Young (Rachel in Bladerunner) as one of the female MP's but she looks amazing!There's also an extra scene of dialogue in the barracks between John & Russell which leads to a huge cut segment of John & Russell aboard a plane with Special Ops guys, jumping out, getting captured by bandits and almost getting killed (I assume this was cut for pacing) but saving themselves by getting the bandits high on acid and singing Quando.Having seen where the scene was cut from, I totally understand why it went (it spoiled the flow of the film, it didn't make any sense, it took up too much time). It does upset the following scene where Hulka asks about men leaving the base but at least explains why that happened.Stillwell briefing the men about Hulka's accident is a new scene which explains their reason to go to the mud wrestling bar better. There are also a few extra small insert shots inside the bar as well.The rifle drill sequence for graduation is longer with more moves than the normal cut. I'm still quite annoyed that they take Hulka to Italy with them. That just wouldn't happen, He was drill training staff. The likelihood of them posting him with that squad would be very low indeed. The fact that the female MP's (Stella & Louise) were posted to Germany at the same time John's Platoon had been sent to Italy is too contrived a plot device as well.The scene loading the EM-50 (An armoured Winnebago!) with shells is another new scene which explains why John & Russell are guarding it alone before they borrow it. Combine that extra scene with the Winnebago scene near the start and this scene now makes even more sense to the plot!There are extra scenes of John in the bedroom with Stella and Russell in the bathtub with Louise, cutting quite a bit of nudity from both women! The shots of the tanks blocking the road into Czechoslovakia has been added. The conversation about Russells sister is new too.I did notice once in the Czechoslovakian base the soldiers stopped speaking Russian and some of them were speaking German? Good goof! The bits that were added on the whole do improve the movie and make the scenes that follow them make a lot more sense. I prefer this version I think. I am annoyed about the press cutting they use for Louise in front of the EM-50, it's supposed to be Top Secret but it's appearing on the front cover of a magazine?Russell's headline is wrong as well Zitzsky rates The Russians, actually they were Czechoslovakians! In general the whole welcome home ending is wrong, this was supposed to be a deniable mission, no-one back home would have even know it had happened. Also Hulka shouldn't be saluting John (and vice-versa) as neither of them are Officers. Watching the end credits I saw Bill Paxton played a soldier.My final words?

Going nowhere, he convinces his friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) to enlist in the US army with him. The two buddies wind up in Ft. Arnold (Get it?), where the focus is on basic military training hiking, running, rope climbing, grenade throwing, shooting, mortar firing, etc. The drill instructor is Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates), who teaches about discipline, duty, honor, courage. But as the brash and outspoken Winger gets under his skin so often he gets to do many push-ups. Of course, much of the dialog and happenings are fanciful. Winger's group, the 3rd platoon, Bravo Company, features more than a few misfits and includes the heavy-set Ox (John Candy), Psycho (Conrad Dunn), dimwit Cruiser (John Diehl), stoned Elmo (Judge Reinhold), and others. Hulka's superior is the inept captain, Stillman (John Larroquette). The commanding general at the fort wants a crack platoon to man the latest project, the army's prototype, the Urban Assault Vehicle (EM-50, which looks like an armored motor home). Captain Stillman is assigned the task; if he fails, he will be sent to a post north of the Arctic Circle. Meanwhile Winger's troubles continue and he tries to desert before he is foiled by Ramis. When our heroes finally escape KP, they go to town; the situation at the local bar ends in a brawl. Along the way, Winger and Ramis hook up with two WACs, Louise (Sean Young) and Stella (P.J. Stoles). A minor miracle occurs when the men of the platoon finally graduate from basic training. They eventually wind up in Europe. When the platoon blunders into Czechoslovakia, then still occupied by Russians since the end of World War II, they are captured. So it is up to John Winger, Russell, and their girlfriends (hard to believe) &#x96; Louise and Stella &#x96; to rescue them with the EM-50. Why World War III did not start there and then is . . . well it's a comedy. Will anybody get promoted? HINT See the title. One of the movie's last images is the press cutting of the Newsworld Magazine article The New Army Can America Survive? One does wonder. The plot is thin and the comedy spotty, but the film has its moments, such as the slapstick basic training scenes at Ft. Knox (not Arnold!). Then again, jumping the girls' bones in the general's house, the mud-wrestling match, and the skirmish with the Russians? Hmmm . . . Bill Murray's humor is sardonic and effective; it suits his personality well. Some will be turned off by his self-centeredness (and his haircut). This is an early effort by many actors, including John Candy, John Diehl, Judge Reinhold, and Sean Young. Late in his acting career, Warren Oates does very well as Hulka, whom he plays so straight that he can practically pass as a real DI. The women are all very attractive. By the way, the striking blonde girl with those gorgeous legs in Stillman's convertible at fictitious Ft. Milano in Italy is Lois Areno (née Aurino, a/k/a Hamilton). Note that in later years the movie director included an Extended Cut, which is almost 18 minutes longer than the released version, and includes several nude scenes. The movie was so popular that it made millions at the box office. Do-wah diddy-diddy dumb diddy-do . . .

He also gets dumped by his girlfriend. Russell (Harold Ramis) is unmotivated as an English teacher to new immigrants.Somehow John persuades Russell that life would be better if they joined the army although Murray with his receding hairline looks too old to be a new recruit.During basic training they meet the larger than life Ox (John Candy) dim Cruiser (John Diehl) and trying to get them into shape is stern Sgt Hulka (Warren Oates.)The platoon leader is incompetent Capt Stillman (John Larroquette) who spends more time as a Peeping Tom.John riles Sgt Hulka very early on and his recruits look very unlikely to pass basic training especially when Hulka is involved in an incident when Stillman ends up injuring him.Despite their incompetence John and Russell manage to charge two female Military Police officers Stella (PJ Soles) and Louise (Sean Young).Murray and Ramis underplay their characters and you see underneath the genesis of characters that they would go on to play in Ghostbusters.The big problem with the film is the script is too scattered and despite the abundance of t & a it is not funny enough. Animal House had some amusing set pieces and an underlying satire about Frat Houses and its linked with social status.Stripes see Murray making not very clever or funny quips which sets him at odds with Sgt Hulka and gets his squad into bother.

Hawn didn't really know very much about the Army or the many regiments and training you have to go through to make it in the Army. While Bill Murray's Pvt. John Winger seems to know a lot about the Army protocols and the many ways he could outsmart and outwit his superiors. To me, his sardonic humour is played quite effectively and might be one of the reasons why this movie is really good. Back in 1981, Illinois native Bill Murray was pretty much in his third year gracing the silver screen with witty charm, cynical humour and manipulative tactics to outsmart practically anyone crossing his path. After donning his craft on sketch comedies like Saturday Night Live and the Canadian equivalent SCTV, Murray has churned up a string full of off-the-wall comedies like Meatballs, 'Caddieshack and Stripes' being his third one shows that his flair for slapstick comedy is just a natural thing for him. Why spoil a good thing? Right?The opening scenes features Winger who after a few hours loses his job as a cab driver, his girlfriend dumps him and a basketball ricochets through his window. Feeling like there's nowhere to turn to, he enlists in the Army. He also tries to persuade his brilliant friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) who's an English teacher to foreign students. The duo collaborates and writes their own set of Army protocols much to the chagrin of the hard-nosed Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates who hasn't acted in while due to poor health). Murray seems to be permanently liberal in points of view towards the people surrounding him, both superior and inferior to him. He's not afraid to speak his mind out about you, even if it's not very flattering. When Hulka get shot, Winger arbitrarily steps up to the plate and commands the other recruits and these are where the funny bits of the movie comes to effect. Unfortunately, like Private Benjamin, Stripes gets lost out of focus near the middle of the film. In Private Benjamin, the film lost its charm once the feminist message comes across while they were in Europe. In Stripes the film gets bogged down one he goes on a mission in Europe. If they would've stuck to the slapstick elements it was intended for, the movie would've been much better. Winger's initiative was to operate on the very first mechanized armoured vehicle, before it gets underway, Winger and Ziskey hijack the RV and goes behind the Iron Curtain and they become lustful towards two female MP's (Sean Young and P.J. Soles). If the focus was on these four characters, it would have worked out in the long run. Instead it concentrates on the ridiculous mud wrestling scenes and the RV hijacking. The final product becomes deplorably infantile and takes away the intrigue that both Murray and Ramis carry throughout the film as likable obnoxious characters. I liked it when Pvt. Winger verbally lashes down at the recruits and belittles their background upbringings.The late John Candy a long-time alum from SCTV fame comes here on his own as Pvt. Dewey Oxberger and he's more than just a friendly heavy- set guy, he's an ally of Winger's and his comedic wit is equally effective and rivals nice with Murray's.

We're mutts! But there's no animal that's more faithful, that's more loyal, more lovable than the mutt.Comedies have changed drastically over time and some of the humor that used to work in the past doesn't anymore, but there is something nostalgic about revisiting that unique style. During the early 80's there were a number of films centering around military cadet training such as Private Benjamin, Taps, Stripes, An Officer and a Gentleman, and so on. These irreverent comedies weren't afraid of being politically incorrect, so some of the jokes might feel offensive and incredibly sexist in today's world (which was the case in Stripes). Coming off fresh from his success in Meatballs, director Ivan Reitman decided to team up once again with Bill Murray for this military comedy. At the time, Murray was mostly known for his work in Saturday Night Live and the National Lampoon Radio Hour. He had gained some recognition for his roles in Meatballs and Caddyshack, but he was just getting warmed up with what would soon be his big break Ghostbusters. Murray convinced Reitman to hire Harold Ramis to play his sidekick in Stripes, and despite having collaborated in writing the scripts for Animal House and Caddyshack, he had no prior experience as an actor. Reitman gave him the opportunity in Stripes and it marked the beginning of a successful collaboration between the three. And that is why I think Stripes is an important film because it helped pave the path for what was to come. It doesn't hurt that Bill Murray is the star of this film because he is an actor who always elevates the material he's in with his charisma and charm. He also shares great chemistry with Harold Ramis, who also proves to have a great sense of comedic timing. A lot of their dialogue was improvised and it helped the two were good friends before filming this. Include a funny supporting performance from John Candy and you have yourself a decent comedy with some hilarious and memorable scenes. The film introduces us to John Winger (Bill Murray) a struggling photographer who is working as a taxi driver. When a passenger begins getting on his nerves, he decides he's not going to take it anymore. He stops the cab in the middle of a bridge and throws the keys out to the river. Things don't get better when he arrives home and discovers his girlfriend is walking out on him for being a slacker and not going anywhere in life. John isn't sure what to do with his life, so he convinces his best friend, Russell (Harold Ramis) to join the Army with him. They don't do it out of a sense of patriotism or anything, but because they know men in uniform are attractive and they also want to get in shape. Once they enlist, their training begins under the sturdy hand of Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). John doesn't take this army thing seriously and that gets him and the troop in trouble most of the time. What he does find is romance, as he and Russell begin escorting two female MPs, Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young), which makes the experience all that more fun for them, but this eventually will lead the platoon inadvertently into enemy territory. Bill Murray proves he's always been an expert at playing these wisecracking cocky characters and he does it in a very charming way so it's easy to sympathize with him. The film does seem a bit unbalanced however with a final climactic act that seems taken out of another movie, but I still enjoyed its dumb humor. Stripes isn't as popular as some of Murray's later work, but it's interesting to see his beginnings and realize he always had his charm. Stripes is an irreverent comedy, but it is unique in that it is quite restrained for what it is trying to say and do, and that is because of the way Murray and Ramis downplayed their characters. Stripes might not be one of Reitman's best films but it is still an enjoyable watch.

It's simply a fun comedy and it dosen't need to, nor does it want to, be looked at beyond that, it's very funny and there are a ton of scenes where you can tell the cast was improvising and having fun together. It's definitely much longer than it needs to be, running for nearly two hours, I found that unnecessary and there were definitely several parts that could have been trimmed to be make this a more suitable ninety minutes, that's as long as I feel a movie like this should be. Bill Murray shines in the lead role, this is very early in his career but it is clearly evident that he already had the confidence and charisma to play the main character and was very capable of holding the whole movie. It's not a flawless film, but Stripes is very enjoyable to watch and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. A pair of slackers join the US Army with the hopes of getting their act together.

Watching it again with high expectations because it is considered a comedy classic and a fairly open mind, I found it disappointing. It has some funny lines, but my general impression was that it missed many opportunities to be much funnier than it was. It has a formulaic three-act structure, but it's weak. It's not what Blake Snyder would have classified as a fool triumphant, fish out of water, institutionalized, buddy love, coming of age or road trip, nor does it seem to fit easily into McKee's more detailed taxonomy of structures. John declares he wants to join the army to dry out, get into shape, acquire martial arts and earn enough money to purchase a Winnebago RV to impress the girls. Russell counters that he has a warped idea of the army as a sort of health club with neat uniforms. Later, Sergeant Hulka says he hopes that one day John will understand that soldiering is about discipline, duty, honor and courage. But of all these noble goals, the only one that gets any play is the Winnebago. At the end of the film, John is the same irresponsible, out of shape screw-up he was at the beginning, while Russell remains his reluctant but reliable sidekick. They don't achieve their goals or overcome any obstacles by acquiring new skills. John does deliver a motivational talk to his platoon, but he uses the same glib used car salesman tactics he used to persuade Russell to enlist. He later throws caution to the wind to come to the aid of his comrades, but this is the same attitude that led him to enlist. Several scenes struck me as mildly amusing when they could have been much more. At one point, Hulka, who has already proved his superior skills, climbs a rope. I remember climbing the same type of rope in gym class as a teenager and I was more of a nerd than a jock. It's not a particularly difficult task, but it seems daunting to the group of misfits for some reason. The scene would have had much more impact if Hulka had used only his arms and kept his legs extended. At another point, a soldier is interrogated by unfriendly adversaries. The scene is dramatically dead, as the soldier had no secrets to protect, and it wasn't funny. There are dozens of ways the scene could have been made humorous. The soldier could have developed a serious stutter or insisted on giving his serial number but unable to recall it. They could have threatened him with bizarre forms of torture or a grasshopper (as in Ronin). Their interrogation techniques could have gone awry. They could have administered a truth serum with unexpected consequences. The platoon is somewhat diverse physically and ethnically, but they're all misfits. They could have achieved much more comedic and dramatic potential by giving each of the soldiers a special skill that John is uniquely able to elicit to overcome the final obstacles. Instead, half a dozen are given one-liners or an occasional pratfall or sight gag, but they're mostly tangential to the plot except for Candy's encounter with a door. A lot of attention is lavished on John and Russell's love interests. As with most comedies other than rom-coms, the attraction of the straight character to the foolish character is not intuitively obvious. Here the attraction seems particularly improbable. Not only does the Army assign two petite girls to MP duty and later send them to Italy for no apparent reason, but these girls who are surrounded by physically fit young men, are irresistibly attracted to a couple of physically inept, irresponsible doofuses who lack the qualities the girls themselves consider important enough to pursue military careers. Not only do John and Russell need to do nothing to win their love and devotion, but they can't seem to do anything foolish enough to discourage them. At the beginning of the film, John's girlfriend leaves him because he is irresponsible, but he doesn't need to acquire responsibility to find love. The film has a few good moments and some funny lines and gags, but could have been much better and squanders a talented cast in underdeveloped supporting roles.

John Candy, Warren Oates & Harold Ramis are tremendously funny. Its indeed saddening that these blessed talents aren't among us anymore. John Larroquette is another topper. He's first-rate.

Broke and desperate, Murray's girlfriend has dumped him, they decide to join the army.The film for me is more memorable for its lesser characters. John Candy is hilarious as a massively overweight recruit, Ox, who joins the army to lose weight and Cooter, who joined up to avoid being drafted only to be told the draft ended nine years earlier. Also good for a laugh is the platoon commander, Captain Stillman, an incompetent buffoon who plays with toy soldiers and loses a top secret weapon.For me my favourite parts are the mud wrestling competition, where Ox takes on two lady wrestlers and wins, the graduation parade where the recruits start dancing and win over a senior officer, and the secret weapon they are assigned to guard in Italy, a Winnebago which doubles up as a tank and ends up behind the Iron Curtain by mistake.Apart from looking a little dated now( someone appears in an anti disco t shirt), Stripes is a hilarious comedy that has Bill Murray in top form and its mixture of comedy, romance( two very attractive female MPs) and a war film is top rate entertainment.

Here in one of his more successful comedies, where he can be forgiven for the fizzer, low on laughs, Club Paradise that saw Robin Williams return to the big screen, after a two an a half year absence, we have comedy, army style. This movie's a great hit, that pays off, thanks not only to the great Bill Murray, but the quirky, no hope, delinquent army trainees, who prove in the end, prove they're not as useless as we think. Warren Oates is a plus here, as a hardened take no s..t drill Sergeant (aren't they all) who laid back, overweight ex cabbie, Murray, gets off on the wrong foot with. The start, prefore to our two, joining up with the army, has insulted cabbie, Murray leaving an old crusty woman, stranded on a bridge. With the dejected Murray coming back into his apartment, if as a tease shot, we see a momentary shot of Murray's younger girlfriend's t..s, leading us to question if it was purposely intended, or just a last moment decision by Ramis. This movie is truly a magical hit and works wonderfully as a hoot and a half comedy that will have you in titters a few times over, while showing you the serious side of, what the army training is really like and dedicated you have to be. The characters the talented actors brought to the screen, really impressed me, especially the psycho who hates being called Francis, providing one of the highlighted comedy moments. Sean Young and P.J Soles as sexy female privates, love interests of Ramis and Murray, provide some nice scenes off the base. In fact, Soles has never been sexier. Stripes forever remains a successful timeless hit, and one I definitely recommend, if never giving it a view. But I can still feel my nuts, when that trainee, misjudges that log, before keeling over.

Hulka, who isn't remotely going to put up with their immature buffoonery. John Candy also shines as an overweight but game recruit in their platoon, who is ready for anything. Undeniably funny at times, but goes wrong when the platoon takes on a serious rescue mission behind the Iron Curtain,; the tone of this is all wrong, not to mention absurd.

"},{"Title":"One of the most ticklish military films","Date":"31 August 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, War","Review":" Ivan Reitman's 'Stripes' is among the funniest military comedies to come from Hollywood. This is also the movie that established Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Laroquette and John Candy as comedy actors (and introduced many like Judge Reinhold and John Diehl). Since then, Reitman has reunite with Ramis and Murray to create films like 'Ghostbusters' (which was a smash hit).The key ingredient that makes 'Stripes' work so hilariously is Ramis and Goldberg's script. Reitman, his producers and writers originally wanted to make another Cheech and Chong film but things didn't turn out as expected and they left it to Ramis and Goldberg to readjust the script for actors Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. Now the writers just knew the actors very well so it was easy to rewrite for them and there was plenty of space for improvisation which added to the spontaneity of the humour.The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly.The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced.To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends.

He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time.When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray.

Bill Murray is his typical everyman, just a plain Joe who is in his late 20's who has no clue what to do with his life. Harold Ramis is his buddy, and the two of them together make enlisting in the Army akin to signing up for Little League. The movie is resplendent with little side jokes and plots. John Candy and his ersatz side kick, played by John Diehl, are constantly doing the Stanly and Ollie routine. John Larroquette plays the typical college graduate who joined the Army to lead men and blow stuff up, and has no clue whatsoever how to do either (Don't laugh too hard, I actually worked with junior Ensigns in the Navy with the same problem). Warren Oats is the only truly straight up character in the entire film, and his attitude is very similar to Bobby Troup's in M*A*S*H (G&* D#$% Army). But you have to love this film, simply because it does what no other film can do, makes a very dangerous and serious profession and turns it into a reflection on the human condition. The film is rated R for slight nudity, language, and inferences to drug use, but I think most teenagers can watch this without being corrupted. Definitely a must for any collector of cinema.

He ruled the 80s (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Scrooged) stole the 90s (Groundhog Day, What About Bob? Rushmore), and remained relevant in the dubbos by interspersing more serious roles (Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers) in between the funny stuff.Though it must be said that the funny stuff is getting harder to find, Garfield 1 AND 2? In reality a minor cameo in Zombieland was the decade's best effort &#x96; I'm not a fan of either Tenenbaums or Steve Zissou.Over the last weekend one of the more retro channels had a mini marathon of classic 80s movies, so over the course of a weekend I sat down and watched Colors, Angel Heart, Enemy Mine and Stripes.Stripes follows the classic strategy of putting funny guys in unexpected situations and letting them act accordingly &#x96; Will Ferrell has made a career out of it (whether I think it a worthy career is another matter) &#x96; in this case John (Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are down on their luck average joes who decide to enlist in the army to make a few bucks&#x85; After all what could go wrong? Right? This lends itself to various scenarios that show John, Russell and a cavalcade of disparate characters (including John Candy and Judge Reinhold) as they bumble and fluff their way through basic training under the watchful and vigilant eye of one Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates).Now as much as I love Murray and this film wouldn't exist without him, Sgt Hulka is what sets Stripes apart. His dogged determination and blunt dealings with his trainees creates a great juxtaposition with John's carefree and anti-rules position, and the two are often at odds with each other over anything remotely pertaining to discipline.Being an 80s comedy there is an inept Captain in charge who has no idea how the army really works, some quasi-hot female MPs who are there to provide John and Russell with something to have sex with, and a variety of non-standard situations to create laughs &#x96; a mud wrestling challenge with nubile young women anyone? So after the troop half arses their way through basic training a could only happen in the movies event sees them all not only pass but get given the plumb job of guarding the army's new super secret weapon &#x96; which looks like a medium sized bus with some cheap metal riveted onto the side panels.Will they get up to mischief and inadvertently set the US on the brink of international conflict? You'll have to watch and find out.Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic &#x96; no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving.As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s.Final Rating &#x96; 7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way.

Probably not the best reasoning,but if we had good reasoning added to the mix of many comedies,they'd seem to cease being comedies now,wouldn't they?Thus we have the seedlings of this largely enjoyable comedy that mixes many of the ingredients of National Lampoon's Animal House and Meatballs(which were directed and/or written by director Ivan Reitman and Ramis),which follows the two protagonists thru basic training on through their first deployment in Europe. And if you're guessing that there's more to the story than merely passing basic training and their deployment well,you'd be guessing correctly.A friend of mine who's been in the Army(around the time this movie was released,in fact)told me that the film isn't based in much reality--and I'm sure most people who been in the Army would probably agree--but I have the impression that this has JUST enough real element in it to make it roundly palpable AS WELL as a lot of fun.A fantastic ensemble cast features Warren Oates in one of his last roles(as their drill Sergeant),John Larroquette(as a preening,weaselly superior),John Candy(as the gregarious,heavy-set recruit with JUST the right amount of rage issues),John Dietz,P.J.Soles(a sympathetic MP who has a thing for Murray's character),Sean Young(same as SOles' character,only for Ramis),Conrad Dunn and John Volstead(pre-Other brother Darryl from Newhart,as Laroquette's oft-put-upon aide)among others to fill out as big,loud and enthusiastic ensemble. Three years later,Reitman,Murray and Ramis(to name possibly just a few)would tone this formula down to PG for the even more successful comedy Ghostbusters. Here,they keep it loose,kinetic and light as a quasi-Cold War,broadly patriotic usage of about 100 minutes of film viewing.A great watch no matter the medium(big screen,TV,video,DVD). The more recent DVDs have plenty of back-chatter,tributes and story about the making. Well,well worth the price if you're up for it,as well as this show.

As with the previous two-Meatballs and Caddyshack-Stripes also stars Bill Murray. Also, as with Meatballs, Ramis' co-writers here are Len Blum and Dan Goldberg with Ivan Reitman once again directing. They make a good team here, Murray and Ramis, as they end up joining the Army mainly because of the former's bad luck in his last two hours as a civilian. Among the people they encounter in basic training Judge Reinhold and John Candy who was familiar with both Bill and Harold since they all worked for Second City during the '70s while Candy and Ramis were on SCTV together as well. Anyway, they have a tough sergeant in Warren Oates who provides at least one serious scene with Murray when he tells him what he really thinks of him. But there's also John Larroquette as a bumbling captain who's threatened with Artic duty if he doesn't shape up. Oh, and besides Ramis and Candy, other Second City/SCTV members in this movie include Dave Thomas as a mud wrestling host and Joe Flaherty as a Russian guard. And finally, Ramis and Murray fall for a couple of female MP's played by Sean Young and P. J. Soles, respectively. Okay, with all that out of the way, I'll just say that I found Stripes hilarious up to the graduation and not as much after that but still pretty entertaining. Now, despite that earlier confrontation scene between Murray and Oates, one doesn't really expect too much learning about Army life on the former's part but part of me did feel he genuinely respected the sergeant and vice versa at the end. One more thing, while you can no longer be asked if you're a homosexual when applying for the military because of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, I still found it hilarious hearing Bill and Harold's replies. Okay, so on that note, I definitely recommend Stripes. And, remember, There she was just a-walkin' down the street singing Doo Wah Diddy Diddy Dumb Diddy Doo... P.S. Larroquette is a native of New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current hometown of Baton Rouge, La. And his assistant is played by John Volstad who is best known as one of the Darryls on Newhart and unlike there, he has lines here which was interesting to hear.

This military comedy, then, falls in the latter category unfortunately, it is not among the better comedies to have emerged during this time. As indicated, I watched the extended edition of the film which, at 123 minutes, is grossly overlong for this type of fare &#x96; even if the added footage (about 16 minutes' worth) is not merely filler material. Also, it deals with a milieu which had been treaded all-too-frequently over the years &#x96; which makes the whole exercise somewhat predictable, tiresome and downright pointless! Besides, I have never warmed to Bill Murray's arrogant, narcissistic and self-satisfied personality; the supporting cast includes other exponents of '80s comedies &#x96; namely Harold Ramis (serving also as co-writer and who would re-unite with Murray and director Reitman for the GHOSTBUSTERS movies), John Candy and Judge Reinhold (from the POLICE ACADEMY series). Somewhat surprisingly, Warren Oates takes on the predictably tough role of the D.I. &#x96; who, naturally, engages in a battle-of-wills with the rebellious Murray and even has to contend with an incompetent superior of his own. Again, it comes as no surprise at all that Murray (and Ramis) become involved with a couple of girls (HALLOWEEN's P.J. Soles and a pre-stardom Sean Young respectively). The last third of the film resolves itself into an elaborate action sequence as the two couples, who had decided to take a holiday in Germany driving a bullet-proof van armed with missiles (the army's latest secret weapon), find themselves having to rescue the rest of their unit who had gone after them and have ended up incarcerated in Communist Czechoslovakia! Mind you, the film is watchable enough for what it is &#x96; even if one could hardly call it memorable or even hilarious &#x96; but the various elements do not really jell together.

Warren Oates is in fine form as drill Sgt. Hulka. P.J. Soles as Stella Hansen and Sean Young as Louise Cooper, both MPs on base, serve as the love interests of the two men. John Candy is one of the raw recruits, 'Ox' Oxberger, while John Larroquette is good as the neurotic and useless Capt. Stillman.I watched it with Emily, a recent high school graduate who is enrolling at West Point this summer, as her introduction to basic training in the Army! SPOILERS Hulka gets injured by a wayward projectile, and the guys have to train themselves the final night before the graduation review. They are unpolished, but disciplined, and so impress the general that they are sent to Italy on special assignment. Winger and Ziskey, as usual, get everyone in a bind, in an unauthorized venture into Communist Czek territory, but Winger and Ziskey also come to the rescue.

We meet John Winger(Bill Murray), a out of luck guy who just lost his girlfriend, house and job all in one day. He decides to join the army. He brings a friend along and this is where the story gets thin. It goes on and on, the two meet these girls and they steal a tank...it's a long plot for a movie that should be about a hour and 15 minutes long. I think if they just showed the guys training and having funny moments, it would be more easier to laugh at the film. In the end, I didn't even laugh for the last 15 minutes of the movie. The beginning is hilarious though. It's a all around good film. John Candy plays OX, the fat friend of everyone. He is the funniest one in the entire film. In the end, Stripes is a good comedy, with funny moments you won't forget. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Early Bill Murray comedy that will keep you ... singing?","Date":"23 November 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, War","Review":" It's funny how you become attached to the things in your life. This movie is one of those things for me. It was the last feature film I saw just prior to reporting for basic training with the United States Navy. Sitting in the theater, I had little idea that a few weeks later, I too would be marching in step while singing Manfred Mann's Doo Wah Diddy, Diddy with 80 other recruits in late 1981. I should note that this movie had absolutely nothing to do with me joining the service. That would be another comedy altogether.---- John Winger is a New York City cabbie having a bad day; he gets ripped off by one fare, incessantly berated by another, run over by the Repo Man in his own car and has his pizza dropped in the alley... upside down. Just to top things off, when he tells his girlfriend that he's quit yet another job, she decides it's high time they call their relationship quits. It's just not fun anymore, John.Russell Ziske is a smart guy. Trouble is, he doesn't have the job to prove it. Russell is just getting by, teaching Basic English to a fresh group of immigrants from God-knows-where. Learning their sole knowledge of English consists of words you could never use during the Oath of Allegiance, he decides on another tack that soon has them singing backup during his rendition of Phil Spector's Da Doo Ron Ron.While splitting the last remaining beer at Winger's apartment, a commercial for the United States Army comes on the television. Making a bet that he could still do 5 push-ups, it occurs to John that maybe the Army isn't such a bad idea. He gets Russell to drive him down to the recruiting station. Winger hesitates when they get there, looking at Ziske and saying, Well... are you coming? ----FAST FORWARD 25 YEARSStripes is a military film staple. Having seen it a zillion times while serving aboard a variety of ships (I did 23 years in the service... who knew?), it has sat in my meager DVD collection for some time. But recently, I took the opportunity to watch it again with my new bride, who, being an immigrant herself (Though capable of much more English than the Do Ron Ron group) had never seen it before. I was prepared to sit through it with a jaundiced eye. She, however, was soon giggling and laughing at parts exactly as I had those many years ago. Her laughter reminded me of how truly good this comedy is. Murray does a respectable turn as the reluctant soldier learning what life in the military means. Outrageous, even ludicrous at times, it never the less leaves you feeling good at the end and humming a certain ... diddy. I would never hesitate recommending this film. It's part of Americana now. And for good reason.

Luckily, the crucial point comes relatively late here the moment they're sent to Italy. After that there's much indifference in the air.But before that, amid some over-stretching and a few misses there is much good to be found. The dialogue has many highlights as one can see by clicking once or, perhaps preferably, viewing this.A remark the film has a peculiar air of childishness to it. I do of course realise that they know that most of this is not exactly highbrow.Anything with Murray is always worth seeing, but I think Ramis here even funnier than him. Then again, he was writing this, but let's not split hairs now, shall we?

The Cold War nostalgia of it just makes it even better. The movie is basically trying to make the army the way Police Academy made the Police look. For the most part, the training camp scenes were well made and the Graduation scene was great. However, the story develops very slowly and the way that Winger loses his job, girlfriend, and apartment could have been improved upon. You wouldn't even know its a comedy until the march with the there she was just a walking' down the street.. The ending was just pretty disappointing. It was OK and you knew what they were trying to do to make it funny but it just couldn't make you laugh as much as during the basic training scenes. The final scene with the Soviet newspaper propaganda and the American magazines was nice but couldn't make up for the stupid climax. I think it would have been better just to leave the movie to the Army camp and edit the little RV thing out. But, Stripes is a Man's film when it comes down and is just hilarious at times.

Under the order of Sgt. Hulka, the army under goes a five week training class till Hulka is in an accident. This causes John to train his team before graduation, and at graduation his team performs gun marches that wows the whole supreme. They are so good, they are assigned to look after a top secret military truck that John takes into his own hands and has his team kidnapped. Now it's up to him and a few friends to rescue his platoon!Now my first impression of the film, could of been better. The cast is made perfectly but there are to many nudity jokes and slow scenes that drags this film by the roots. But that doesn't stop Bill to stop being funny. He gives a great performance as Winger who doesn't care what happens to him in the army. Harold does a good job acting as the careful and hectic best friend Russell but the best person in this whole movie is John Candy as Dewey 'Ox Oxburger. His scene at the strip club in the mud wrestling pit is priceless. I'm a lean, mean, fighting machine! This film may drag but it reaches it's goal with a good supply of action, tons of one liners that work, and love relations between two MP's and the two stars. The whole plot at the beginning switches totally when Bill and his platoon have to guard the army vehicle but the real action is in this sequence. You'll love the ending with the newspaper headlines in magazines like Penthouse and Romance Finders. Stripes gets the big 7, could of been better but it works in it's own way.

With great comedic acting from Harold Ramis, John Candy, John Larroquette, Warren Oates and others, you just have to laugh, no matter haow bizzare or Politically incorrect it is.John Winger (Murray) and Russell Ziskey (Ramis), two bummed friends, are bored and tired of their lives...so they join the US army.  Not really a wise choice, in a post-Vietnam War backdrop it presents.  Hilarity ensues when the Winger and Ziskey join up with a platoon of misfits and rejects, which includes Candy, Oates and a young Judge Reinhold. Capt. Stillman (Larroquette) plays a grumpy officer intolerable of Winger's men (a slight wink to the film's staggering number of National Lampoon's Animal House references) After promoting from basic training, the team is sent to a European country (I believe it's Italy at first) to guard and secure a new armed transport automobile that looks more like a RV than a tank.  Unable to hold him, Winger takes Ziskey to West Germany (remember the time) with him to go see his girlfriend, a fellow officer.  During this time, the platoon makes a dumb mistkae by crossing the 'Iron Curtain' of Czechoslovakia (at the time still under the control of the former Soviet Union) to do a covert mission and the team is captured by boarder guards.  Feeling a sense of duty, Winger and Ziskey cross the boarder to rescue the crew from Russian control.  Of course, laughter is served.Stripes is a hilarious film, even though it's, wihtout any doubt, extemely dated for the time.  Not dated meaning Murray and Ramis' younger looks, but of the politics in the film...the entire army still wears the Vietnam-issued green uniforms (compared to the enventual brush fatigues that was issued at the beginning of the 80's).  It's kinda silly still seeing Germany spilt into West and East (remember, the wall didn't come down until 1989, so it would be another 8 years before Politically correctness would step in), along with a Soviet control Czech republic.

Stripes was the first movie which used this aspect of his screen persona to its best advantage.The appeal of Stripes is plain. Can aging hipsters get it together and fulfill the promise that they once saw in themselves without becoming squares? The movie says, Yes, and places Winger and Ziske in that veritable graveyard for hipness, the armed forces. The hook They're too smart to be grunts, but not too smart to learn some lessons. That gap is where the humor comes from. By turns this movie looks down on the service life and shows the advantages of its discipline. Make no mistake, however, it's the hipsters' show.

Basically John Winger (Bill Murray) is a quick-witted cab driver, well mainly ambitious loser, and his friend Russell Ziskey (alos co-writing, Harold Ramis) is no different as a foreign people's English teacher. They see an advert for the army, and decide to join more as a joke than a career. They soon start basic training under the hard-nosed, impatient and no nonsense Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates). Other 'goofballs' of this platoon include overweight Dewey 'Ox' Oxberger (John Candy), naive Cruiser (John Diehl), constantly stoned Elmo (Judge Reinhold) and appropriately nick-named Francis 'Psycho' Soyer (Conrad Dunn). After an accident causes Hulka to be unable to lead, Winger takes over, and with a new (obviously humorous) demonstration they impress the generals. Winger and Ziskey also find time to romance two pretty female MPs, Stella Hansen (Halloween's P.J. Soles) and Louise Cooper (Sean Young). Later, they commandeer a high-tech military vehicle disguised as a camper van fro a weekend away, and doing this stumble into an international incident. Now they are obviously fighting the enemy, and trying to get out alive, and in the end are all obviously praised as heroes, and individually put on magazine covers. Also starring John Larroquette as Capt. Stillman, John Voldstad as Corporal, Stillman's aide, Lance LeGault as Col. Glass, Roberta Leighton as Anita and Antone Pagan as Hector. There may not be many hilarious jokes, but I can see what the critics mean by this being Murray's breakthrough, and the platoon marching and singing Manfred Man's Do Wah Diddy Diddy is fun.

He had already made the hilarious Caddy Shack, then Stripes, after that is GhostBusters, and then Ground Hog's Day. Stripes is a classic. Some of the humor may seem dated, but I saw this when I was 15 and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The story centers around two buddies who decide to join the army to improve their rundown life style. While in the service, they constantly get into trouble with their strict drill sergeant, Sgt. Hulka. In fact, every time something goes wrong, Sgt. Hulka is right in the center of it.The film also features John Candy, and Sean Young back in her 'Blade Runner' era. As I've said before, this may seem kind of dated, but it is enjoyable, so I would recommend this to any Bill Murray fan or anybody who wants to see a funny movie.

I am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure, due to reading some of the comments on this film on here. I am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic! All I can say is thank god the Cold War never escalated or else we might as well have given the Commie's our borders... I found this film dire in the utmost pretence, maybe it is just my British perception of what makes a film funny, who knows? But in all aspects, this film is not just awful, its teeth grindingly terrible.I've never been a fan of Bill Murray, and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster's, which was made only three years after this film. But this just sums Bill Murray up really. I can safely say that I haven't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here, though these two films have more in common than you would think. For 1 thing, they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end, and 2nd. They are both riddled with cheesy Cliché's, throughout.Heres one thing, these guys are supposed to be in the U.S Army. Yet they are allowed to wallow around their Camp, Willy nilly, seducing female Military Police Officers, and subsequently shagging them silly in the Generals Quarters. Talk about Random! This film is just terrible for this I'm afraid. Now don't get me wrong, I'm no feminist sympathiser, but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them, letting them go free... Twice, is just insulting to the female race. The fact that one tatty haired, fat lipped bum (Winger) and his hapless sidekick Ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the MP's underwear, to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous.Then there is the training scenes, where you get to meet the Squad Phycho who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff, followed by the overweight bloke (played by the late and great John Candy) who claims he joined the army to avoid paying $400 for anger management classes. Leading to loud mouthed Murray paying tribute to the Giant Toe, (WTF?) 'Drill Seargent' who honestly couldn't organise a pi$$ up in a brewery, let alone his band of recruits. All this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes, with people saying way to go ass hole'! all the time, etc etc.The scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the Assault Course, leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle, peppering a watch tower with bullets. (Just like that. Yep, told you this film was random...He miraculously escapes undisciplined as well...) Eventually Leading up the the passing out parade, where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours. (Bugger me, Miracle!) Thanks to some wise words from Murray, to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a Geriatric 'General' in front of the rest of the squads. All of this to the immense pleasure of their two Girlfriends on the stand, who really should've been arresting them... Everyone laughs it off though. This bit is nothing short of amazing though. He then chooses them to guard a new Multi-Million Dollar Prototype Armoured Vehicle in Italy (which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside), claiming This is exactly what this Army needs! righto...Then there is the dire finale, where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this top-secret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany. To which the Hapless Captain (John Larroquette) then finds out and leads the Squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval Mission for this vehicle. To which they then take a wrong turn en-route and end up in Soviet Held Czechoslovakia, where they are captured. (Like we didn't see that coming...) Thus begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray + Birds in hand, to which is where a big fight, loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up. With them coming back as National Heroes, humiliating the Russians by calling them pussies, etc etc. The end. Thats right. No Courts Martial, nothing. They only just stole a prototype Military vehicle, drove it into a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an International incident which could've sparked WW3!This film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness. I know its meant to be a Comedy, it got all the right actors for it, but where in the hell is it? Have Channel 5 cuts those bits out? The only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers, and female Mud Wrestling. (like I said, Random) Not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film, of course. This film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year old's, sadly, we have to watch it instead. 1 star out of 10 - Total Tripe. My advice, do something a little more useful with your time.

As my friend said last night there is a fine line between T&A and rip off porn. Personally I am not a fan of porn, especially how the plot is non-existent, and the only one I ever saw, the guy who was watching it simply fast forwarded most of it and goggled at the explicit sex scenes, which I really did not appreciate.Anyway, that has little to do with this movie. Stripes is basically about a loser who gives up on his job because he can't stand the customers and loses his girlfriend because she wants somebody who can grow. So, in a fit of despair he and his friend decide to join the army. Then it simply goes through the incompetence of his squad during basic training who end up getting into trouble in Czechoslovakia and getting out alive.Really there is little more to this movie. It makes a bit of a joke of the army, suggesting that general infantry are simply incompetent fools that manage to survive through pure luck, and the lieutenants are idiots. The only competent soldier in the entire movie (other than the other brigades) was sergeant Hulka. And he gets stuck with the worse brigade of all.I guess this movie is okay, if you simply want to turn your mind off and watch something that is really, in the end, meaningless.

But one of my favorite things they do is ask which movies I haven't seen and try to stump me, which my boyfriend did the other day with Stripes. I was a bit confused because I thought it was a movie I would have seen but never did. So he bought the movie and we watched it, from what he was describing, I was expecting one of the funniest comedies. After all it has Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and John Candy, some of the funniest actors of all time. But honestly I wasn't all that impressed, not to put the movie down, it does have some funny moments. Bill and Harold have excellent chemistry and make for great best friends on screen. John Candy is always a pleasure to watch and honestly I think that he stole the movie, he is just one of the most lovable actors in history and naturally you can't help but adore him. I watched his biography the other day and apparently the mud wrestling scene was very uncomfortable with him because of his weight, but he did it anyways just for the laughs and that's what makes him so wonderful, he is willing to do anything to put a smile on a person's face. But as wonderful as his presence is, Stripes is still over rated.John Winger is a slacker in his late 20s who experiences the worst day of his life as, in the span of just a few hours, he quits his job, his car is repossessed, he drops his pizza on the street, and his girlfriend dumps him. Realizing that his life is a failure, he decides he needs a new direction. At that moment, a recruiting ad for the U.S. Army plays on the television, and he decides that is just what he needs to get in shape. Talking his best friend Russell into joining, they quickly drive to the nearest recruiting office and are soon off to basic training. Moments after arriving, Winger has already offended their drill sergeant, Sergeant Hulka, and stands out as a misfit throughout basic training. So throughout training, Winger keeps messing up and continues to be a goof as others are punished for his actions. He starts to question if the army really was for him all along or if there is still a strong possibility to over come it all and be an adult.So did I hate the movie? No, I did like it. One of the scenes that I did really enjoy was when Murray finally gets his act together and pulls his troop in for the graduation and shows off. It was well put together and really excited me. I also loved how Murray makes some of the drills into a joke and as they're marching they start singing the do-a-diddee song. There are some memorable moments in the movie that definitely make it worth the watch. But over all I have to say that the script isn't one of those non stop laughs stories. It's one of those movies that I saw once and am more than happy with seeing the one time. So for nostalgic reasons, I would recommend it big time, plus it has an excellent cast that I'm sure you'll love. Though I admit, these were the good ol' days of dirty comedies and didn't apologize about it, I miss those and at least with Stripes I got a little of my traumatic childhood back.6/10 "},{"Title":"One of Bill Murray's First Box Office Action Comedies!","Date":"6 May 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, War","Review":" Meatballs director Ivan Reitman scored his first major hit with this formulaic adventure comedy about a pair of civilian misfits who momentarily take leave of their senses and join the U.S. Army. Cab driver John Winger (Bill Murray) experiences one hideously terrible day when he loses his job, watches helpless as his car is repossessed, and his girlfriend walks out on him. In a fit of lunacy, Winger persuades his best friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis), who teaches English as a second language, that they can be all that they can be if they enlist in the U.S. Army. Essentially, this uneven but hilarious spoof about military service succeeds because of Murray's outlandish sense of humor and Magnificent Seven composer Elmer Bernstein's exhilarating score. No sooner have Winger and Russell gotten to boot camp than they confront their worst nightmare, crusty old drill sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates of The Wild Bunch) who hates Winger's smart aleck sense of humor. Hulka has Winger doing push-ups to straighten him out. When our misguided heroes try to go A.W.O.L., they encounter two sexy Army MPs, Stella (P.J. Soles of Jawbreaker) and Louise (Sean Young of Blade Runner) who bring them back alive. Meanwhile, our heroes have an incompetent officer, Captain Stillman (John Larroquette of Blind Date), doing his best to berate them. The platoon that Winger and Russell land in consists of misfits, such as the overweight Ox (John Candy of Spaceballs), witless Cruiser (future Miami Vice regular John Diehl), wacky Elmo (Judge Reinhold of Beverly Hills Cop), and sneering Psycho (Conrad Dunn of Jumpin' Jack Flash). Most of what follows is predictable. Nevertheless, Bill Murray's improvisation skills serves him splendidly, particularly his big toe speech in the barracks. Of course, Sgt. Hulka and Winger don't see eye-to-eye, and Hulka uses Winger's insolence to punish the entire platoon. This is about the time that they have their first date with Stella and Louise. At one point, pompous Captain Stillman wants to make our heroes repeat boot camp, after they embarrass him during a fight at a nightclub that sponsors mud wrestling with bodacious babes in skimpy attire. The night before graduation, Winger and Russell train their Army buddies how to perform complicated rifle movements so they can impress General Barnicke (Robert J. Wilke of The Hallelujah Trail) and they succeed in amazing the general with their adept rifle spinning skills. Indeed, General Barnicke is so impressed that he orders Stillman and his men to fly to West Germany and participate in his top-secret project involving a multi-faceted EM-59 Urban Assault Vehicle. Hulka gives everybody else weekend passes, but he orders Winger and Russell to remain behind on base and guard the EM-59, a 1970s GMC recreational motor vehicle equipped with technology galore, including a missile firing system. Stillman takes his blond babe of a girlfriend to show her the vehicle late one evening and discovers to his horror that the vehicle is missing. Winger and Russell have appropriated the recreational vehicle so that they can take Stella and Louise on a date. According to the sentry, Winger and company took the vehicle out to get it washed.Meanwhile, Stillman rounds up the platoon and they pursue Winger and company, except that they take a wrong turn and wind up in the Soviet Bloc where they are captured and subjected to torture. Although he advised Stillman against a rescue operation, Hulka joins Stillman but later leaps off the truck transporting Stillman and company after Winger and Russell. Our heroes pick up Hulka's distress signal and plunge into the Soviet Bloc in their souped up, military SUV, blow up a guard tower, and rescue their buddies. This action-packed finale marks Stripes as an anti-communist movie as out heroes along with Stella and Louise get the drop on the poor border guards at the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and Winger ties them up and puts on a Czech uniform. A pitched battle rages as Winger and Stella, armed with machine guns, breaks Stillman and the platoon out, and hightail it back across the border. Along the way, Sgt. Hulka leaps onto the roof of the motorhome and rides out with them. Ultimately, Stillman is transferred to to a weather station near Nome, Alaska, while Winger, Russell, Hulka, Stella, and Louise come home to a hero's welcome. Ironically, in A-Team fashion, nobody is seen either getting shot-up or killed during Winger's raid.

After losing his girl, his job, his home, and even his pizza (Then depression set in, he announces), he sees a TV commercial for the Army, and convinces his friend Russell Ziskey (sweetly played by Harold Ramis), an English language teacher who's better at teaching cuss words to his students than English, to drop everything and enlist with him.Basic is a challenge for Winger, as the Army expects him to be a soldier! In a unit comprised of idiots, psychopaths, potheads, and an overweight recruit who enlisted to shed a few pounds in a 'Club Med'-style environment (John Candy, who is very funny), Winger immediately attempts to take charge, only to be put down by gruff drill instructor, Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates), who is wise to all of Winger's scams. Not that this interferes with Winger and Ziskey's social life; the pair soon have MP girlfriends (P.J. Soles and Sean Young) sharing trysts in the General's quarters!The film's highlight occurs after Sgt. Hulka is incapacitated by an exploding grenade. Faced with having to start basic training all over again, Winger coaches the unit overnight in HIS kind of drill for the final Review and Parade. Unfortunately, everyone then oversleeps, and arrive at the Parade Ground in all manner of dress. Winger's unorthodox marching routines are a hit, however, and the General, thinking he is watching a crack outfit, addresses Winger in one of the funniest exchanges ever recorded on film!Unfortunately, STRIPES doesn't end with Winger's completion of basic training, but moves to Europe, where the unit (and Sgt. Hulka) are assigned to guard an attack vehicle that looks suspiciously like an RV. While there are a few amusing moments in this final chapter of the film, it lacks the inspired madness of basic training, and drags, a bit, until the famous 'Magazine Cover' postscript.All in all, STRIPES is a memorable, if flawed near-classic, and paved the way for Murray and Ramis' blockbuster, GHOSTBUSTERS. If you're a Bill Murray or service comedy fan, it should not be missed!

Looking at their directionless lives, both John and friend Russell decide to enlist in the army to become men.  Despite hating the regime, both men do surprisingly well - a fact which leads them to a project in Italy.The plot here is pretty basic and has been done many times before and since - wise ass joins the army and mocks it before eventually making good in his own way.  The film is split into two; the boot camp being the first and the mission in Italy being the second.  The first part treads familiar ground reasonably well without ever being very funny.  The second part is absurd and is far too silly to really be funny.  Plot didn't so much matter to me as long as I was laughing quite a lot but sadly I wasn't and the scripted gags and scenarios just felt tired, daft or both.What saved the film from being bad was a great lead from Murray.  He shows himself to a great comic touch and this film was part of his breakthrough to films.  He doesn't have that many great lines but his delivery and his wise-ass delivery really does the job.  Ramis looks less assured and doesn't seem to be taking it very serious (but not in a good way).  He seems unsure of himself in front of the camera and gives a poor performance.  Oates is good and both Candy and Reinhold are pretty funny.  Young has a small role and isn't annoying - so that's good then!Overall this is a silly comedy that might win you over if you are really in the mood and happy to accept less.  However I found it to be rather too daft to be funny and didn't laugh at great deal.  If you aren't sold on the silly comedy during the boot camp then the second half with a mobile home acting as an urban assault vehicle will just leave you cold.  Murray is as good as he usually is but the film just ain't that good.

This was after Lenny Bruce could be pure by being profane and before we  got into nostalgic humor. So he developed his routines around the notions of not being  the character.

They get stuck with a group of utterly annoying and unfunny guys (who the audience is supposed to find hysterical) and a tough as nails drill Sgt (Warren Oates). Naturally John is constantly cracking funny one liners and screwing up deliberately left and right. None of it is funny at all. Then, at the end, it inexplicably turns into an army drama!This was a huge hut in 1981 and its popularity totally escapes me. I didn't like it back then and I still don't like it now. I should point that, personally, I never found Murray that funny. His blank face and obnoxious manner made me annoyed with him more than anything else. This movie does nothing to change my view. Basically the movie just isn't funny! I didn't smile (let alone laugh) once! Each joke fizzled out completely or they give us these somewhat interesting characters and NEVER build on them! When you get John Candy and Daniel Stern in a movie and even THEY'RE not funny something is seriously wrong. Worst of all is John Larroquette as Capt. Stillman. EVERY scene with his is terribly unfunny. And WHAT was the thinking of turning it into a generic action film at the end?? It's also incredibly sexist. You have the incredibly beautiful women P.J. Soles and Sean Young as MPs. Naturally they meet Murray and Ramis and let them get away with murder and almost immediately have sex with them. That's just pushing credibility WAY too far. The absolute low point is a pointless and downright revolting mud wrestling match when Candy is wrestling with five bikini clad beautiful women. Naturally he (inexplicably) gets ALL their tops off and waves them around! The two good points are Oates (giving a GREAT performance) and a bombastic score. Why this movie was such a big hit is beyond me. A 1 all the way.

Since these two buddies are merely comic actors in a major motion picture, they decide it will be fun to join the Army in order to annoy their fellow cadets, infuriate their commanding officers, and generally do whatever it takes to wring laughs out a premise that can't possibly fail.Except, of course, the premise fails. Not for one moment do we believe these two are in the Army, since the smarmy grins never fall from their faces. Could they be more aware they're making pretend in a Hollywood movie? And the humorless drill instructors and sitcom-ensemble supporting cast only serve to underscore the stacked deck from which director Ivan Reitman is dealing. He would later direct the brilliant Murray and tolerable Ramis to perfection in the classic Ghostbusters, a movie smart enough take its own premise seriously. Stripes is less a satire of Army life than an elitist, semitic mockery of anyone dumb enough to JOIN the Army. I love Bill Murray but I could not get over my immediate dislike of the two main characters to laugh at anything that happens in this film. Much like the brilliant Animal House the movie runs long, and takes an odd second-act detour as the gang steals a mobile assault vehicle and single-handedly... storms an enemy compound? Wins the war? I forgot because I had stopped caring about these characters long ago.Released fresh on the heels of the far-superior Private Benjamin, Stripes has advertised itself for years as a comedy classic in spite of the fact that no human seems to agree.

Stripes also inspired later films like Police Academy, Spies Like Us and Combat Academy, with its simplistic plot structure showing inept recruits going through training, irritating the hell out of their superiors, and finally coming good in the end. In itself, Stripes is harmless fun for the most part, with obvious jokes and pratfalls and occasional flashes of foul language and nudity. Of its type it is a passable enough time-filler (there are, without doubt, FAR poorer examples of movies of this kind).Lazy layabout John (Bill Murray) realises his life is going nowhere and time is running out for him to make something of himself. Joined by his pal Russell (Harold Ramis), he decides to sign up for the army. Initially John and Russell expect this to be a ball, believing that they're in for the kind of action-packed, globe-trotting escapades shown on the army-recruitment TV commercials. Soon they realise they're in for a much tougher time than that as they begin the gruelling training under the leadership of the sadistic Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). After various misadventures and crazy pranks, the wannabe-soldiers under Hulka eventually get their act together and earn their qualified stripes.... whereupon they are promptly sent off to Europe to safeguard a top-secret new armoured vehicle. John and Russell take the vehicle for a spin, little realising that the rest of the U.S. Army think they've stolen it to hand it over to the Communists. The rest of their platoon are ordered to find them, kill them, and return the vehicle to its rightful place, but they are captured by the Communist forces and locked up in a Czechoslovakian prison camp. John and Russell do the only decent thing, and use their army training to bust their pals out of jail.The film not only brought Murray's comic talent to the fore. A quick glance down the cast list shows other future comedy superstars like John Larroquette, Judge Reinhold and John Candy also given this early opportunity to show their skills. Oates also scores as the absurdly larger-than-life NCO, giving a performance of comic flair that is a million miles from the sweaty, dirty anti-heroes he used to play in old Sam Peckinpah movies. The storyline is totally predictable and implausible, and little effort is made to adopt any form of subtlety or wit, but for what it is Stripes works well in its broad and simple-minded way.

Otherwise, you wonder what else is on TV or if you have any better, funnier movies in your collection.I generally think highly of Murray's comedy Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day, What About Bob?; these are all great comedies. The problem with Stripes is that Murray seems to think that any anti-establishment behavior in the Army is going to come off as totally off the wall when really it's just an extended SNL sketch. Harold Ramis is actually much funnier and more careful with his comedic timing. Murray is all over the place, passing punch lines and belaboring others. While Murray plays with confidence, his performance has such indecisiveness that he seems to have just said whatever came to his mind and gave up on the script entirely.Conrad Dunn's small part as Psycho was perfect. He made a cartoon out of his character quite successfully. Murray won't take that risk, because no matter what role he's playing, he's never acting. You never forget it's Bill Murray saying those lines or doing that crazy thing. Murray has the Jack Nicholson disease where any character he plays pales in comparison to his own personality, which can be an asset. In this film, it's problematic. Murray gets better at creating characters later in his career, but this film is a dud, and when you sober up, you'll likely agree.
