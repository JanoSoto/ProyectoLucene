Probably this is because the 2.5 hour running time of the original release is actually vastly too short for the story. The director's cut is a whopping 4.5 hours, but goes by so quickly one hardly notices. If you are bored, then you probably haven't figured out what's really going on. Some notesThis is a story of trials, of how our relationships to each other, and to humanity and the Earth, are shaped and impeded by technology. It is a fearful story of the dangers of our world as Wenders saw them in almost 20 years ago now. The journey is central here (as it is in almost all epic works) and the story doesn't work without seeing that journey unfold first all over the earth (and no, it wasn't about sponsoring nations--the journey of Sam and Claire et al reenacts other journeys only alluded to in the film, bringing up themes of connectedness to family and place.)To me the most important theme in this film is the power of the journey and of stories to transform us--a theme so old we may be tired of it, though it remains relevant today. Eugene (Neill) is to me the central character, and any good viewing of the movie depends on understanding how he fits in as more than a side character caught up in a great chase. One last note this doesn't deserve to be described as Sci-Fi. Yes, there's some science-like imagery in it, but the thrust of the movie is literary. The science-fiction in the movie serves only as an extension of the transformations and journeys of the characters. It turns those things inward rather than outward, and succeeds well in doing it. A truly remarkable and excellent film that got a bad first screening because no distributor had the guts to put out a 5 hour movie. (What would they say to Akira Kurosawa these days?)

Sam has a most ingenious device that enables his blind mother (Jeanne Moreau) to see, and some other people are trying to get their hands on it.I simply can't do justice to the movie by trying to describe it. You have to see it to believe it. For the soundtrack, director Wim Wenders went to several singers and had them write the songs that they were going to write at the end of the millennium.

I could not believe what I had just seen when I first viewed it. It was like nothing I have ever experienced before. That's just what this movie does, too... provide the viewer with an experience. The plot was like nothing I've ever seen. It was fresh, intelligent, and a bit philosophical. The characters were complex human beings with realistic thoughts and emotions. Not everything that occurs does so for good reason... just as life really is. Thoughts and fears that human beings share are presented in this movie in a truly unique manner. It often plays out in a metaphorical way (i.e. You're on your own, Claire = aloneness), allowing us to feel like intelligent viewers, instead of viewers that need our hands held. Every character has his or her flaws, and motivations. The movie does bog down a bit in the middle, and jumps around in an alarmingly chaotic way, but it's too realistic to fault. I found it both enjoyable, and thought-provoking. The idea of addiction to our thoughts and dreams, chasing an infatuation without knowing why, and waiting for the final curtain to fall, are aspects of the movie that fascinated me. I am not saying this as a fan of Wim Wenders, since I had never heard of him before this. I most certainly know who he is now! I had to find out after viewing this movie, which unfortunately cannot be seen in its entirety. It's brilliant, interesting, and intelligent. Great acting, haunting soundtrack, and fresh plot make this movie a real winner.

There are no villains or car-chases or explosions (okay, maybe ONE).  German director Wim Wenders projected the world 10 years into the future, to 1999.  He added only a touch of strangeness, such as cars which speak to the driver and warn of traffic conditions, or videophones (which require people to stay stylish and well-groomed all day in case of an incoming call?)     An Indian nuclear satellite's orbit is decaying, and it may generate an electromagnetic pulse that will wipe out all the world's computer memory.  Against this ominous Y2K backdrop, a French party-girl named Claire Tourneur meets two bank-robbers, and the money they confide to her attracts the interest of a hitch-hiker named Trevor McPhee, who takes some and takes off.  Trevor attracts the interest of Claire, and from there it's a merry romp around the world as the story crosses nine countries.  We discover Trevor's hidden, almost Messianic mission  to give visions to the blind, but not without risk to the characters' minds.     The plot of the story is understated, and there is very little violence except for the emotional violence the characters commit against each other.  That makes this film more European than American.  Wim Wenders also solicited the collaboration of many pop music artists, asking them for a song like what they would be writing in 10 years' time, making for one of the strongest soundtracks in movie history.     I found that the pace of the film avoided being too languid by the variety of countries and their refreshing sceneries.  Wenders carefully crafted his imagery and strongly blended it with sound, albeit the inherent beauty of his film serves to tell a somewhat minimalist story that will nonetheless linger with the viewer.

Wenders shows us a completely technological world, which he then confronts with the good old way of life. Bis ans Ende der Welt can be understood in 2 ways space or time. During the movie the viewer travels in both dimensions and will leave the cinema dazzled and deeply moved.

Beautifully shot and scored, the movie rewards those that allow it to unfold rather than showing you the plot in the first 15 minutes. With an emphasis on personal emotions rather than screen presence, the actors reveal much about us all- no super-heroes here.Granted it is a long film by American standards but who can say how long a film should be? I felt transported to the times & places Wenders takes us, to me this makes a successful film regardless of its length. The storyline is well crafted and the music editing is brilliant; when I hear the music today I think of the film and not the bands that performed it.William Hurt has a role (finally) that suits his personality.

I became so wrapped up in the plot and immersed into the character's intensely desperate interactions, that I felt exactly like Claire addicted to a sequence of images with sound. It's magical and for anyone who enjoys a long, smooth paced story on film it will cast a spell on you. Granted, some of the acting is a little awkward but it is, after all, a B movie with B actors, and I tend to think that it adds character to the piece. Not to say that the acting was bad, but it wasn't what drove the movie. The drive behind this movie was in fact the actual words, the screenplay, not so much the delivery of those words. Sam Niel's narration so perfectly sets the mood for the desperation and near depravity of the characters involved in the narrative, and being that this is science fiction, this was an excellent goal for the writer and well achieved. Niel's character's melancholy mood, after having a failed marriage with the one that he loved (the main character, Claire), sets the standard for everyone else's character in the picture, and all the sadness and underlying melancholiness just blends together seamlessly to create what equates to the sign of the times for those that have any meaningful thoughts in their heads. Which is very often the aim of most science fiction stories, yet has never been reached to same the degree that it has been in this film. That is the films single greatest achievement, and is the source of all the magic that propels emotiveness of this story. Aside from that, the story itself is extremely well played. There is government conspiracy, but it is not an overwhelming part of the plot where the whole world is in danger and is need of saving. No, in the case of this movie it's human integrity that lies at the core of the theme. Integrity in terms of the way that powerful governments treat people who stand in their way, and the level of integrity with which people treat themselves. In the case of the characters in this movie it is unclear who is worse off the people mistreated by their government, or the people who have mistreated themselves. At the end of the movie, the characters who go all the way, and too far at that, so much so that they become depraved and anti-social to the extreme, have possibly taken them selves to a place worse than death. Which raises the question how could any of the characters be truly happy if all they were searching for to make their lives better was a blasphemous addiction to something sacred and ominous like their dreams? They had relearn that what is most important in a healthy life is healthy relationships. In short, integrity. Even still, we get caught up in the character's sadness from the beginning of the film, and it's not wrong on our part, because sadness is a part of a healthy life. As far as story goes, sadness is one of the most interesting emotions to watch. That is because inherent in sadness is healing, or personal progression. Which is what drives all plots.

As in most of Wenders' films, there are moments of great beauty, elevated by the use of silence-- the sudden quiet in the plane, as the shadow slips over the hills (this is my favorite moment in the film)-- and there are Wenders' usual striking, trademark images from a moving vehicle of the landscape racing by. This movie, about vision and re-vision, also has a lot to do with poetry and transportation, like King of the Road and Alice in the Cities. The soundtrack is altogether delightful. Like all of Wenders' films, it is exactly a half-hour too long, but like most of his work, it just manages to redeem itself.  I believe this is his best film after his masterpiece, Wings of Desire.

Upon learning that it's a piece of science fiction, I decided to give the film a try.Bad news first the film is long. It runs for a good two-and-a-half hours, but incredibly, it's only the short version; the rough cut was originally eight hours long, and the director's preferred version is 280 minutes. Even at 150 minutes, this film feels long and it drags at times.That doesn't mean it's a total bore. The film is pretty evenly split in half (for the theatrical cut anyway; the director's cut is supposedly arranged as a three-part trilogy). The first half is easily the most interesting and thrilling, as it follows this woman all across Europe and Asia and everywhere else, investigating some shady people and mysterious devices and roaming around some strange post-modern futuristic settings. It comes off much like a sci-fi film noir, somewhat akin to Brazil, but nowhere near as goofy. In the film's last half, with a great catastrophe befalling the Earth, the characters wind up holing themselves up somewhere in Australia, where they bum around for the remainder of the picture. I found this part far less interesting, but it offers a few interesting ideas (including one key aspect that echoes Inception a lot). Altogether, I'd say that it's an interesting film with lots of interesting ideas and plot points, but it achieves the type of pacing that straddles the threshold of being fascinating and unfascinating.If anything in the above paragraph indicates anything, it's that the story itself is pretty sound and full of neat ideas. It's populated by interesting characters. I really don't have many complaints about the story, other than it felt like it trailed off in the end.This film looks neat, with quality photography and editing. Acting is swell I did get a kick out of watching William Hurt, Sam Niell, and Solveig Dommartin in their roles (and Max Von Sydow makes an appearance toward the end). Writing is alright. This production does its best to use then-modern sets, props, and costumes for a futuristic look, but with mixed results. Frankly, parts of the film look cheap and cheesy, in a manner no different than Paul Verhoeven's films. Still, it gets the job done. Music is pretty cool.It's an interesting film and I'm glad I saw it. It is a shame that this film was a commercial and critical failure on its release, because it's not that bad at all.3.5/5 (Entertainment Pretty Good | Story Pretty Good | Film Pretty Good) "},{"Title":"Will stay with you for years to come.","Date":"5 March 2002","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I first saw this movie 10 years ago, and have seen it perhaps 50 times since then. There has never been another film that has so affected me this way... the images, dialog, and music keep coming back to me, and each time I watch it I see something new. All this, and I've only seen the edited version, not the 5-hour director's cut, which I hope someday will be released on DVD.Wenders has a different way of working - he develops the dialog, and even the plot (so the story goes), as the film is being shot. One of the reasons it all seems so real.The integration of the music is fantastic, and gives just as emotional weight as the stunning cinematography. Rather than slap on some pop music in post-production as most directors do, he first solicited songs from his pals U2, Nick Cave, Peter Gabriel, et al to write a song about the end of the world. He then wove the resulting music into the script.Every 6 months or so I'm amazed by some bit of news in real life that was actually telegraphed by the film, years ago. Remember the crisis with India and Pakistan developing nuclear arms a few years back?Solveig Dommartin is intoxicating, William Hurt is his usual self, but for me Sam Neill is the best.

The film features William Hurt visiting at least nine different countries, gathering images on a camera that records the electro-chemical act of seeing.  He is pursued by a bounty hunter, several governments, a would-be lover and HER would-be lovers.  Eventually the film ceases to be about a physical chase and focuses on man's pursuit of his dreams and the inner workings of his mind.First, the weak point.  This film is seemingly interminable.  We've come to expect 245 hr movies to spice things up with gunplay or a sinking ship, and UTEOTW lacks such devices. Just as the characters reach Australia, the viewer feels the film is winding down.  Wrong!  There's another whole movie, just about! Nevertheless, to those who look past the superficial, and aren't plagued by the notoriously short American attention span, the film is a goldmine.  Several characters are richly developed, and the many foreign locales help to retain the viewer's interest.  The film's brightest star, however, is the soundtrack.  So often, soundtracks nowadays are songs from (the credits) and inspired by the motion picture, whatever that means.  In this movie, the songs are hip, progressive and PERFECTLY integrated into the picture.  In fact, I actually saw the film only after being really impressed by the cd.  The musical talents include U2, REM, kd lang, Lou Reed, Depeche Mode and Peter Gabriel.  The REM tune and others are unavailable in general release, and Gabriel's Blood of Eden is markedly different from that song on his Us album.The thematic material regarding vision is not new (check out Oedipus Rex, for example) but the technological spin is unique.  By that same token, Wender's '91 depiction of '99 is not so far off the mark  Satellite automobile navigational systems, sophisticated tracking devices and India as a growing nuclear threat are all presaged in this work.  Again, if you are patient, enjoy attention to details and relish psycho-philosophical pursuits mixed into your chase scenes, this film is a winner all the way around, and makes great viewing for any Y2K-themed film festivals!.

She seems to hardly care about the events that surround her, until she meets 'Trevor MacPhee.'

So now, I feel compelled to put down a few comments about this long awaited masterpiece.Many viewers have had to watch the VHS version for some time, a version that Wim Wenders refers to as the 'Reader's Digest' version, and loathes. I never minded it myself and enjoyed it nonetheless, but I was amazed just how much better the 3 DVD Director's Cut was. There is so much more story going on that is missed due to the editing that it boggles the mind. Especially the ending, which is actually quite different. I'm not going to give any spoilers, even if you have seen the US release.Some people are clearly not entertained by this movie, and it's understandable, it's long, it's different, there's no explosions, kung fu fights, gun battles or CG; so if that's what you've come for, you'll be disappointed. However, if it is a human drama that your interested in, and a hopeful film that points out several science-fiction possibilities, then you'll love this movie. So many science fiction ideas over the years eventually become realized and the possibility of the idea of restoring the sight to the blind and recording dreams via the visual cortex is downright compelling.I've seen this movie too many times to be unbiased in my opinion and easily state that it's in the top 5 films ever made.

As in his other movies like Paris, Texas, the backdrops become another character in the film. Just like the title entails, Wenders was challenged to get the WHOLE world into his movie. He has succeeded. At the end of The End of The World, we finally see it as we should all see the Earth.The characters represent different ideologies of the different countries they're from and Wenders uses this to develop the plot. These countries are trying to seize control of one man's vision and a source of power. However, they soon find out that not one of them can control the outcome of the movie. The movie is Wender's commentary on global politics and socioeconomics. He portrays the world in a flurry of action from a European car chase to a U.S.A in recession, to a dichotomized Japan, and to an isolated Australia. It is an accurate depiction of the world we are living in now because that is how the movie was filmed - out in the streets of the real world circa the end of the 20th century which enhances the theme of the movie. If you watch this movie you will believe you are living at The End of the World. The movie is even better NOW then when it first came out. It's been 13 years since the first showing and I'm 28. Being a teenager, the sci-fi, action, fast-pace and the heroine's romance with William Hurt held my attention but to truly appreciate the WHOLE MOVIE you have to get past the juvenile/pop culture themes. Being a woman, I identified with the heroine and the way she acts at the end of the movie and I think you will, too. The men will relate to the narrator because they tend to distance themselves from what's really going on in this movie and cut to the chase. Overall, the movie is good for the whole family to watch except for one nude scene.This summary took me awhile to write but as I went through the process of analyzing the movie from memory it became easier and easier as the film's key scenes flashed into my head. This only proves how powerful and clear Wenders' vision is as a director.

Words versus images (surprisingly Wenders comes down firmly on the power of the word), art versus technology, impulse versus commitment, the struggle to find meaning in the places you find yourself and people's ability to constantly start over, be it in art, science or life &#150; none get much more than a cursory once-over as it becomes ever clearer that Wenders' destination is more geographical than thematic.Set in a still far-off 1999, when America's plans to shoot an out of control nuclear satellite out of the sky lead to mild economic and social chaos as the possibility of a chain reaction and the end of the world looms, it's something of a shaggy dog story following Solveig Dommartin's bored party girl across four continents. Surviving a car crash, she looks for a mission in the new life she has been given and finds it in the form of William Hurt's fugitive, who steals some stolen money she's holding for Chick Ortega and Eddy Mitchell's robbers. Following him across the globe with the aid of Rudiger Vogler's private eye and followed herself by her ex and the film's narrator (Sam Neill) and Ernie Dingo's bounty hunter, several countries and a couple of aliases later she discovers he's recording images of his family for his blind mother (Jeanne Moreau) with a camera that allows the blind to see that was developed by his father (Max Von Sydow), in hiding from the US government in Australia...As long as the film is moving from city to city, Wenders is able to sustain some semblance of the illusion of forward motion, but the film stops dead in its tracks when it reaches Australia, which is a big problem. Not only is the end of the world still a long way off, but so is the end of the film &#150; with more than two hours to go it's hard to disguise the fact that there's not much to show for all the mileage covered. If anything, it feels a bit like a long business trip to a place you've never been with people from your office only to find that your appointment's been postponed once you finally arrive, but since the hotel room's already paid for you find yourself sticking around for a day or so anyway killing time. The film does get back on track in the last half hour as the characters become addicted to their own dreams and become completely unable to cope with reality, but you can't help feeling it could have got there a lot quicker.While Neill, Vogler and Hurt fare well enough and Von Sydow has one good scene, co-scenarist and leading lady Solveig Dommartin makes a poor focus for such a sprawling endeavour. Another in that long line of muses &#150; Catherine Hessling, Cybill Shepherd, Sondra Locke &#150; luring once great directors onto the rocks with their siren call of mediocrity, she's not much of an actress with little screen presence to compensate, while her English delivery doesn't do her many favours. It's telling that one of her best scenes is a (presumably) deliberately awful but surprisingly charming rendition of Thank You For the Days accompanied by piano, drums and didgeridoo that makes up with enthusiasm what it lacks in ability. Still, compared to Adelle Lutz's horrendously awkward phonetic delivery as her best friend Makiko, she's Sarah Bernhardt.But no film with a hero called Trevor can be all bad, and for all the self-indulgence there are enough good points to keep you watching. Some of Neill's narration is rather good (possibly down to co-writer Peter Carey), there's an eclectic soundtrack that takes in Peter Gabriel, Talking Heads, Lou Reed, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, R.E.M., Elvis Costello and pompous soft-rockers U2 among many others, Robby Muller's cinematography is typically impressive and the film makes the outskirts of San Francisco look like a Third World shantytown. Some of the predictions were at least in the right ballpark &#150; satnav systems, the Americans shooting a rogue satellite out of the sky and a joke about the Rolling Stones' 'last' concert &#150; and it only gives into outright xenophobia in a horribly misconceived comic scene in a Japanese hotel. Yet the film is definitely less than the sum of its parts, with Wenders all too clearly going all Hearts of Darkness as he constantly seems to rework the slim premise into whatever latest brainwave has just struck him &#150; with an African epilogue unfilmed, if the producers hadn't pulled the plug he'd probably still be shooting to this day. (As it is, the German DVD has another half hour of deleted scenes and outtakes and it wouldn't be entirely surprising if Wenders delivered an even longer cut some time in the future.) Still, the Bounty Bear was fun...

And so it was. Way, way too long at almost 3 hours the story is played out across the world. The characters are flat and unengaging - the two male leads being played by Sam Neil and William Hurt who specialise in alienation and distance. Neil's facial expression is the same whether he is in love, being betrayed, chasing the bad guy, being mugged, or watching his beloved in agony. Even the most emotionally charged part of the film - in the father-son relationship during the last third - is clichéd (with Max von Sydow playing to type) and stilted.The plot twists and turns, but in the end leaves many things unexplained - it's not at all clear why Hurt is being pursued in the end or who the people were that pursued him. It all gets resolved by the supposed disaster which never materialises - a disaster movie with no disaster, an apocalypse with no horsemen. It's full of disjointed parts that don't add up to a satisfying whole. Many of the scenes are completely flat and add nothing. When Hurt wakes up between two elders, they seem to be as baffled by their appearance in the movie as I was, and he is as unreadable as ever.The idea of hiding away in Australia with a tribe of Aboriginals is somewhat novel, but this is a white man's fantasy I think - they are a group of Man Friday's who attend to his every need, although there is a step too far and they do leave him which once again is done with minimal emotion.The whole thing was as dry as the Aussie desert. Maybe you had to see it on the big screen, but in the end I did not believe the film was visual stunning - it used some stock shots of the Australian Outback but there was nothing very interesting in the way the film was shot.I found myself earnestly wishing for the end of the movie, if not the world.

Claire however has other problems, seeking solitude she gets mixed up with tow bank robbers and agrees to delivery the stolen money to Paris.  On her journey she meets Trevor McPhee, who enlists her help to escape a man who is chasing him.  Trevor steals some of Claire's money to continue his global journey.  Claire pursues him across the Russia, America and Germany (with a detective and ex-boyfriend in tow) to find his quest is more emotional than it is criminal.Wim Wenders &#150; simply a great director, visionary in his own way.  However here he bites off more than he can chew with an ambitious road movie that, like the satellite that threatens the earth, easily spins out of his control.  The story starts intriguingly &#150; Claire's journey is interesting and her globe trotting is at least entertaining.  It doesn't have a great deal of humour &#150; but it is light and it feels like Claire, Trevor and Eugene's journeys are all building to something.However it doesn't provide.  The final hour of the film is static &#150; all in Australia, and it becomes heavy with pretention and navel-contemplation.  The subjects of dreams etc are broached but it doesn't convince, despite throwing up interesting images and some intriguing ideas.  It very much crawls to a conclusion and it's almost a relief when it ends.The title suggests that there will be an element of apocalyptic dread about this.  I know that's not the focus of the film, but I did feel it could have used this better.  At the start it is mentioned and we see some evidence of panic etc but after that it is forgotten &#150; in fact everywhere seems quite normal.  Later in the film something happens that threatens the earth but in a desert in Australia we never know what's happening and indeed neither the characters or the director seem to care either.  I don't know why they bothered with the story line at all &#150; they certainly didn't do anything with it.The cast are OK, but they move all over the place with the tone of the film.  The best summary of the cast is that Hurt and Neil are nearly always watchable.  Dommartin as Claire isn't as good as she needs to be and can't carry the `quest for love' side or the `addicted to dreams' side.  They do provide some good moments but the characters are as illogical and meaningless as the film itself!  Why would two bank robbers let Claire transport their money AND let her travel the earth for her lover and continually send her money to do it?!Overall this provides several entertaining moments, but this is never as deep as it thinks it is.  The second half is bogged down in a heavy plot and babble about dreams etc and by the time the ending comes you'll almost wish that the satellite had just fallen quickly and put us all out of our misery.  Deeply disappointing.

It's a somewhat creepy techno-globalized and paranoid world facing an uncertain future, with an out-of-control Indian nuclear satellite looming ominously in the sky.  Solveig Dommartin plays a flighty and impulsive femme fatale, who stalks a mysterious loner (William Hurt) across the bleak futuristic landscape, one step ahead of a ragtag assortment of bounty hunters, oddball bank robbers, and an ex-boyfriend (Sam Neill) who narrates.  The moody, scenic, slow-building style is quintessential Wenders, and it's possibly his finest work.But once we reach the promised end of the world, in the Australian outback, the film takes a sharp left turn into third-rate psychodrama and ultimately comes unglued, with a long, dragging denouement that should have been cut entirely.  The film clocks in at roughly three hours, but it feels more like four.  Fans of Wenders' other works should definitely check this one out, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.

After the film's theatrical release, Wenders worked with multiple copies and, with Sam Neill, recording additional narration, completed a 280-minute version. The longer cut, which Wenders regards as the definitive version of the film, unfolds as a trilogy and is presented in three parts (the titles appear three different times).The version I saw was around 150 minutes. If it were any longer, it would definitely need to be broken up into parts. It is a bit confusing, and definitely strange. This is science fiction, but not your typical kind.

Shining through past his visionary use of animation (including dream-realization astonishingly close to contemporary science), his compassionate eye for character, his skill at keeping a sophisticated audience wanting to know what happens next, his unerring ear for the right music, is a quality of benevolence which, while not denying the existence of evil, gives it no purchase.And then there are the actors, who give skillful voice to ideas while providing breadth and nuance to the thousand odd tasks they are given. Wenders doesn't avoid the sheer fun of having Rüdiger Vogler play an older Winter not morally improved but very adept at playing the harmonica. He pays homage to Ozu as well, casting Ryu Chishu and Miyake Kuniko in a perfect interlude which he admitted to creating for the purpose of casting Ryu.Wenders spoke to the above and other issues after the film. On the music, he revealed he had written to such artists as Lou Reed and Patti Smith asking them to project their art ten years into the future (some twenty agreed and their songs are in the film, seeming more contemporary than the 1991 film date would suggest). He also described exhausting the still experimental Japanese digital technology (and technologists) which enabled him to create the film's absorbing dreamscapes.Very rewarding, too, seeing one of our great filmmakers get the standing ovation appropriate to his work on Until the End of the World.

This was before the internet era so it was kind of difficult for a layman to check facts and film critic Kim Newman in a review suggested that Bono and the boys had more than a little input in to the soundtrack . The title of the film does of course come from a track from their 1991 masterwork album Achtung Baby so you can understand where I'm coming from . On top of that Newman suggested this was road movie meets the apocalypse and I do love speculative fiction and being vaguely aware of Wim Wenders who did a strange twist on the serial killer thriller genre THE GOALKEEPERS FEAR OF THE PENALTY . On top of that it does contain several well known names in the shape of Hurt , Neill and Von Sydow. It surely can't have been a bad film in that case? An Indian nuclear satellite spins out of orbit and threatens to destroy the world so what does everyone do ? They stand around discussing their lives and the human condition . Is this logical ? Probably not . Is it compelling in any way ? Definitely not . This is really tedious stuff with the plot aimlessly wandering about . If you think there's a subtext to this where the plot line is mirroring the characters in the film I suggest you stop taking university film courses and try and find something more productive in life . I'm not being cruel just pointing out that this is the type of film that only gets produced to appeal to students and film snobs . I'm not defending the rubbish that Michael Bay and the rest of Hollywood churn out but there comes a point where the average audience member has had enough of slow moving brooding introspection and hope the film ends before the world does Apart from having a severe lack of anything to hold the interest of the audience there's a painfully unrealistic depiction of the very near future . In the 1991 depiction of 1999 nearly everyone wears a hat . In the real world of 1999 the only people wearing hats were chavs sporting baseball caps so the film has got that minor detail wrong and a major detail about having a machine that can capture dreams . Perhaps the worst mistake with hindsight is Wenders claiming the soundtrack reflects the type of music the featured artists would be performing in 1999 . This patently unlikely especially where U2 were concerned . In 1999 they were working on All You Can't Leave Behind which was a departure from their 1990s material so I'm afraid Wenders got that one wrong same as he seems to have misjudged everything else about the film "},{"Title":"This movie FEELS like the end of the world.","Date":"22 July 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" 'Until the End of the World' is a disassembled mess that lays a lot of plot points on the table but never bothers to put them all together.

A young woman (Solveig Dommartin) is on her way to be with a man who is not her boyfriend. Along the way she meets a man (William Hurt) who is being chased by some rather tough characters.From there the movie is a long series of travels from on continent to another picking up things that we think will be important to the story. Eventually we end up in Australia where Hurt's father (Max Von Sydow) is working on a cure for the blind. Ho-hum. What does it all matter when the end of the world hangs over their heads.I just saw Last Night another movie the about approaching apocalypse. That movie was about real characters and asks what they would do in this situation. This too long with too much plot.I like Wenders style of taking characters and having the patience to develop their story rather then tell us everything them play it out.

I like his movies, but they tend to be so glacially paced, I get driven to distraction. I can watch consecutive European art films, but, for some reason, it's always been Wim Wenders that personifies the objectively good, yet too slowly paced art film for me. von Trier, Tarkovsky, Bergman, and Herzog are child's play, to me, compared to Wenders. To some extent, I would also include Akira Kurosawa in the same category as Wenders. If you're a huge Kurosawa fan, I would imagine that you'd also like Wenders.However, I really loved Kurosawa's Ran. Something seemed to be different about it. The pacing was sped up, the characters were more alive, and the general film seemed to be more appealing to one of my disposition. I've tried to steel myself and go back to watch Seven Samurai, because I know it's such a hugely important and influential movie, but I always end up chickening out, thinking that I'll just have the same reaction as last time, Objectively, this is a very good movie -- but it's just not for me. Or maybe it was just a bad day for me to watch a Kurosawa film -- who knows. Like Ran, I had the same reaction to Until the End of the World. I knew it was a Wim Wenders movie going in, but I was drawn to some other aspects the soundtrack was made of contemporary music that was very appealing to me, I like Sam Neil a great deal, and I'd seen some good William Hurt movies (though, his occasional wooden acting was a bit of a turn off in others). I think Until the End of the World is more of an *experience* than it is a film. It has a bit of a dreamlike quality to it, a sort of surrealism that is always in the background, at the edges, and never in the forefront. Maybe I like it so much because it reminds me of the kind of bizarre post-apocalyptic adventure that I might experience in my dreams.Until the End of the World is classified as a road movie, I suppose. It's got elements of many different styles and genres, but, at its heart, it's the story of one man's journey through the troubled final days of civilization, what happens after the fall, and how people adapt. I remember thinking to myself, This is amazing. I wonder if the director will have the courage to keep going with this vision and show what happens after the inevitable climax? Indeed, he did, to my joy. In fact, the movie changes gears, segueing from globe-trotting adventure-mystery to a scifi drama. I can understand how this might confuse or annoy some viewers, but I found it to be fresh and exciting -- much the way that my own dreams frequently will randomly change genre from horror to adventure at the midpoint. Unlike my dreams, however, the change was a natural progression, fluid and sensible. Some people might not have bought this change in genre, but, to me, it seemed to fit perfectly, if you look at the first half of the movie as setup for the second half. If you're uninterested in near-future science fiction or surrealism, I can understand how you'd find the movie to become derailed by the second half. I'd disagree, but I can understand where you're coming from.I liked Paris, Texas, though I couldn't sit through the entire movie. If I remember correctly, I got most of the way through that movie. With Wings of Desire, I eventually gave up around the halfway point, as I became too frustrated with the slow pacing and late hour. I never went back and finished it, though some day I may. So, if you're the type of person who says, Wim Wenders? Doesn't he make those really long, slow paced art films? I don't know if I'd like him, give this one a try. Though I generally do enjoy most art films -- even those considered to be impenetrable and slow -- Wim Wenders has always been a bit of a problem for me. Not this time, though.I've heard that there's a 280 minute director's cut, broken up into a trilogy. Holy crap. I gave this movie a 9/10, which is pretty rare for me (I usually hover around 6-8, even for movies that I really like), but I don't think even I could sit through that. It just screams Wim Wenders to me -- a good idea with a great follow-through, spread out over several hours of glacially slow pacing. I'll probably give it a try some day, but it sounds daunting.

Even more so to call it cyberpunk. I just have trouble believing that just because you incorporate a few elements of sci-fi and film-noir detective genres in a near-future setting, it is just automatically cyberpunk. And even just to call it science fiction... the supposed overall premise that the world could end due to a nuclear satellite destabilizing is not actually particularly science fiction (nor even hardly realistically scientifically plausible) but it's pretty much completely ignored for the entire movie, so what does it matter. likewise, the device is little more than a generic MacGuffin for most of the film, and when they finally do get into it, it is with the shallowest, most cursory glossing over of any interesting exploration of the concepts, remaining little more than a MacGuffin still; a random crux for some ridiculous, muddled new-age psycho-babble philosophical wanking, which doesn't really go anywhere or last very long; just seems to be a random way of ending that part of the film. Anyway, if you really were interested in checking out some real sci-fi about topics such as these, you could so easily do SOOO much better, so don't get roped into watching this just because the sci-fi aspect sounds interesting. about the only interesting thing in that regard is that they somehow managed to predict modern automobile sat-nav units pretty much exactly!! So, all that out of the way, this movie is obviously VERY long. I am almost curious that a better edited version could be more interesting, but I don't really see how that's possible. It's the content, not the length, that failed to keep my interest. I did find it pretty interesting in the beginning, enjoyed the bit in Japan, and the Australia where most of the rest of the film took place seemed remarkably realistic and down to earth compared to typical depictions, so that was somewhat interesting.But in general it just wandered nowhere so aimlessly... I doubt it's true, but I really got the feel that they were just making this up as they went along past the initial setup, and really could not figure out where to take it without writing around in circles, into corners, through ridiculous plot-holes, trailing loose ends all along the way.Of course, this wouldn't be so bad considering Wenders' penchant for stunning, timeless cinematography, directing, pacing, and phenomenally real, alive, emotionally transparent acting... but shockingly none of that is in evidence here! about all this albatross has going for it is a few interesting characters, a few pretty good minor actors, and a rather cute, intriguing leading lady, but even that wasn't nearly enough to carry it past the first two hours.The use of various languages could have been interesting, but I just found it jarring and unnatural. While it seems that many of the actors were pretty gifted in at least one language, they end up speaking a lot in other languages, particularly English, in which their performance seemed severely curtailed. Absurdly enough, the well established American actors actually tend to give some of the most wooden, hokey, unbelievable deliveries in English on here! And i generally do like them in other films I've seen.It's all pretty inexplicable. I can't find myself believing most of what takes place in this film. Other reviews on IMDb have pointed out a few of the ridiculous plot holes and pointlessly unrealistic plot twists, and I'm not much inspired to suffer remembering it to point out more; there are PLENTY.But even when you ignore these technical blunders, the main dramatic story line just makes no sense to me whatsoever. Why does she suddenly fall in love with some random guy just because she runs into him on her little adventure, gives him a ride, and he steals some of her money? i certainly see no chemistry or connection whatsoever between them at that point; it's completely out of nowhere. And she's instantly completely obsessed with him and it becomes her life-consuming mission to stalk him literally to the ends of the earth, not even to get back at him, but to have sex with him and save him from... she has no clue what from? As stupidly as I have seen some women behave, I can not believe that she would keep this up after risking her life only to be used, stolen from again, and ditched the first SEVERAL TIMES! And why the heck would he keep doing this and conceal the device and his motives completely from her, when it turns out later he really is such a nice guy? So there you have it, pretty consistently horrendous acting, not much special visually, a tangled, moth eaten plot that drags on forever going nowhere for no particular reason, fairly uninteresting characters who make no sense, self-inconsistencies and loose threads out the wazoo, and not really that much in the music department as far as I'm concerned. A huge disappointment from the director of one of my very favoritest movies ever! What a drag.I'm not sure what to recommend as a much better, alternative to this film with relatable themes or elements, but definitely check out Wings of Desire, and maybe some appealing works by Kieslowski, Tarkovsky, Wong Kar-wai, maybe even Fellini... Even if you like this film, believe me, you CAN do MUCH better, so keep looking!

Of course I have to give it extra points just for spending extra time in one of my favorite world-class bars - the Tosca.Even though this is a cyberpunk sci-fi film, and an art film and a road film, it manages ultimately to be introspectively psychological (as do all Wenders films that I have seen so far). I cannot watch this movie without shedding at least a tear for the beautiful and talented Solveig Dommarten, whose career and life were cut far too short. I see other reviews talking about the lack of story.

The world is closer to ending than it has ever been, which means its just a story on the news in the background, most people try to ignore.The first segment, in this three part film, is their chase cross country and continent, A Dance Around The World, as the book about their lives is latter called.They begin in Italy, and go on to Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Bejing, Tokyo, San Francisco, and finally the Australlian Outback, our heroin Miriam discovers, that Hurt is wanted for a stolen piece of Government property, a device that records the experience of seeing and translates the information as images. He is recording the most beautiful places in the world, for his blind mother. He is the son of Max Von Sydow, the inventor of the device. Their cat and mouse game becomes a whirlwind romance of constant movement and escape.By the third segment they reach Sydow's underground lab in Australlia, where they also discover that the device cannot only record seeing for the blind, but can record dreams if left on during sleep. The aboriginals who run the lab with Sydow refuse to work on his dream machine. Slowly but believably the rest of the staff, becomes obsessed with staring into the recordings of their dreams, It got to the point where they dreamed of their dreams...and fell ever deeper into the black well of Narcissus ..There are car crashes, planes losing power midlight, and one gorgeous locale after another. Like Alphaville and The Fall this film is completely indebted to its beautiful sights, that it finds and photographs. At five hours long, you can imagine it meanders a good deal. And it does, but for a film so dedicated to the pure spectacle and profound importance and danger of seeing things, I didn't mind.Future content wise, there is a clear opposition between the dual natures of the machine, helping the blind to see the world, and allowing the sightful to intrude upon their private internal world, whose appeal is magnetic and addictive. Tecnhology is a double edged sword, amazing but not without its serious ethical and philosophical dilemmas (which is the more real world the one within or without? etc), this movie doesn't delve into it conversation wise, it's lets everything play out, at five hours it gives you the credit that you can work it out for yourself.It's really just a beautiful film to watch, that's much sweeter and gentler than most sci-fi, and more fascinating too because it doesn't shove its implications down your throat.Wim Wenders, got people like The Talking Heads, Can, Lou Reed, Patti Smith, Elvis Costello, U2, Nick Cave, and many many more, to make original songs for the soundtrack about the new millennium. While many of the songs are very good, most are awkwardly placed as well. No doubt Wenders was really excited about all the music and just wanted to use everything.Definitely flawed, but a richly excessive and eccentric experiments and time capsule. Despite its hefty run time, I thought Wenders was sensitive, to the changing dynamics of the future world, it's not dystopian and it's not Star Trek/Fifth Element Space Opera either, it occupies, a space, where simple good or bad, are no longer really relevant to discussion.At one point when everyone assumes the world has ended Sam Niel's character is playing in a small band with several Aboriginal neural scientists, a few french-bank robbers, a British bounty hunter, and some random strays who wandered into the Australian compound fearful of nuclear fallout, and they play a music that sounds like Australlian Blue Grass; Didgeridoo's and pianos, harmonica's, and trumpets, blending together to create something singular and new. He notes to himself, This entire trip has not been about helping a blind woman to see, or gazing into ourselves. But this adventure, the satellite, the machine, the crash, it all occurred, so we could be here, at this moment, to create this music which would have never otherwise existed, right at the crest of the end of the world.Few sci-fi films are dedicated to power of music(that the characters play), words(that Sam Neil records for his novel), and images(of coming war, of the beauty of the world, and the contours of our own mind/dream/souls,etc). In Alphaville when the computer asks Lemmy Caution, What moves the night?, Caution responds, point blank, Poetry. Wim Wenders updates, upgrades, and extends this concept for the new millennium. Though I cant remember too much of what was said, I'm still humming along days later, with some pretty pictures circulating in my head like post cards from an alternate universe.It's a bittersweet, love, travelogue, adventure story, for the New Millennium; Where In The Wolrd Is Carmen San Diego?, as written by William Gibson on a sentimental day.

To this day there is nothing that even comes close to artistically presenting the movement and evolution of civilised human lives as we live them in a futuristic sci-fi film format.Wim Wenders presented to the world his ability to see human relationships in a very real and advanced stage across the boundaries of society, culture and time. This movie goes on forever and as it does, it EVOLVES. This is unfortunate for those with a slight attention span.The worst part about this film is that it does actually, eventually end.The technology advertised in setting the futuristic scene is absolutely realistic, in fact most of the technology presented then as futuristic is now the readily available technology you see in your cars and phones and is available off the shelf... This was set at the turn of the millennium but written only a decade before. Wenders was not attempting to out do Jules Verne but to place us in a realistic foreseeable future as we follow the lives of an interesting few.The scenery from all around the world is stunning, filmed in the careful , delicate fashion that Wenders had previously displayed in such films as Der Himmel Uber Berlin.The sound track is perfect. Nick Cave, U2, Peter Gabriel, Taking Heads and Depeche Mode all have a close relationship with Wenders because of his art and they all combine to add the polishing touches to this piece of pure art.

By the third reboot, I was too tired to enjoy it much and wondered when or if the movie would ever end. It's a shame, because the characters are very likable, and each story is entertaining; but it becomes too much and too long of a good thing. For this reason, three 8s add up to a 6.

For instance, Solveig drives a car that is very rarely seen in the U.S. but looks like something designed in 1999.  I love all the changes of location, France, China, Australia... I love the Prozac-enhanced acting of William Hurt (my Icon) nothing really excites him, but you can tell he is excited. Nigel Neill aka Sam Neill gives his usual outstanding performance.  And Solveig, with her French accent,  is especially perky in the hand-cuffed to the bedpost scene.

It's visually stunning, and the choice of music and its melding with scenes and moods is inspired - especially Ray Davies' 'Thank You for the Days' whenever it appears. But does the film actually work? Unfortunately not. And the main reason for this, for a native English speaker, is that we have non-native speakers of English being directed by a non-native speaker of English. Although novelist Peter Carey had a hand in the writing, he obviously didn't help Wenders with the directing. So many of the lines are badly delivered, and much of the acting is wooden. Even actors of the stature of Jeanne Moreau and Max von Sydow can't deliver lines in English without good direction. Maybe it all sounded good to Wim, but sorry Wim, it doesn't work for Anglophones. Even William Hurt's and Sam Neill's lines often fall flat. If you speak German, try the German version - it sounded better to me. Otherwise, why not spend the time watching 'Wings of Desire' TWICE, or watch three of Wenders' great early films? They are much more rewarding.

The mix of whimsy and melancholy will puzzle some, who may ask how seriously they are meant to take it? Its length and occasional problems with continuity will put others off. Added to this, what is intended to be the central romantic relationship never quite convinces. But the film as a whole is redeemed by its sheer ambition and, most importantly, the humanity and the generosity of its vision.It's 1999 - that's seven years into the future - and the world is threatened by an orbiting satellite that carries a powerful nuclear device. Meanwhile, Henry Farber has stolen a camera of his own invention from the American government, not trusting the uses to which they might put it. He sends his son, Sam, around the world, collecting images with this device. These images are to be electronically projected into the brain of Henry's blind wife, Edith. On his travels, Sam picks up a stalker, Claire Tourneur, who is on the rebound from a broken relationship with the writer, Gene FitzPatrick. Sam collects images for his mother. Claire chases Sam. Gene chases Claire. The investigator, Philip Winter, who appeared in Wenders' previous film, 'Alice in the Cities,' chases all of them. Eventually, everyone ends up at Henry's lab in the Australian outback, the satellite having exploded and, with all communication cut off, no-one being sure whether the world is still alive. Here, the precious images are projected into Edith's head and, in the single most moving scene in any film (IMHO), she sees a picture of her San Francisco dwelling daughter Elsa, for the first time, but with no idea whether Elsa herself is still alive.And there's more to it than that. Much more.As Sam, William Hurt delivers a convincing and sympathetic performance throughout. Sam Neill is likable as Gene. Rudiger Vogler as Winter is stratospherically cool. Max von Sydow, as Henry, is intensely flawed yet utterly sympathetic and, appearing on screen only about half way through, comes close to making the second half of the movie his own. Jeanne Moreau as Edith is, at some points, heartbreakingly moving. Special mention must go to Solveig Dommartin, who played Claire and who conceived some of the story. It was clearly a labour of love for her - for example, finding that they couldn't film in China, she snuck in with a video camera and taped a few lo-fi sequences single-handed. The film's lack of immediate success must have upset her deeply, and her premature death has robbed her of the chance to witness the recognition that this lovely, warm-hearted story is, little by little, beginning to get, now that the four-hour version is available on DVD. Not to everyone's taste then, but those of us who like it, love it.

Another fault is that, in spite of being told at the outset that the Earth is at danger, the viewer never gets all that excited and interested in that part of the story - and that's quite bad; after all, if we don't care about the Earth's end then how does Wenders expect us to care about his main characters who engage in matters totally trivial by comparison.

If you want to set foot on every land between Japan and Portugal but can't afford it, watch this movie and you'll get the point. But if photography is the only favourable thing about a movie without discussion, then I don't know if we can classify it as a great movie. *** SPOILERS ***There are many points unexplained, and unlikely to be explicable at all. The guy is American, and CIA is following him. Amen! And how come the CIA guy has an obvious British accent? Oh and his parents also didn't sound more American than Gorbatchev. How does the world end, and how does it get back to what it was? And who imagined all those shiny things in 1999? It was 5 years ago, and I don't remember any such technology -)Even the windscreen getting smashed by the beer bottle is not realistic. Unless they meant to start the sci-fi right there, that's totally against the rules of physics. Another absurd thing is the forced internationality. The woman is French, her lover is English (he lives in Paris with her, but doesn't speak French!), she runs into an American whose parents have non-American accents, and these all get chased by a black English CIA agent! So they seek the help of a German detective, and end up with a Russian woman who wants 500000 Dollars to help them with her extreme technology. And every single person involved in the whole thing speaks excellent English too, including the Russian educated during the USSR era. Give me a break! Unless someone forced me to smoke crack and get me into a psychosis while watching this movie and I don't remember, it's simply illogical and not understandable.*** END OF SPOILERS ***I would still say this movie is different from any other, and this makes it somewhat interesting. But I do not dare to say it's not a waste of your time, because it is. If you have 4 hours and 40 minutes in spare time, my advice will not be along the lines of spending that time watching this movie. But if your travel plans just got canceled like me and you're stuck home for the Xmas and new year's with absolutely nothing creative to do, then you should watch this movie and take a peak at its unsustainable glamour.

A curate's egg - good in parts, often shapeless and meaningless. Some amazing images, tantalizing concepts, but empty at the centre. Way too long. The sort of film that would have been greatly improved by a tighter budget.One central idea near the end was of people addicted to handheld computer games, but Wenders made the mistake of showing us the low-definition, haphazard and garish images they were looking at, and unless the people were also connected intravenously, they were a complete turnoff.

Quite by accident she gets involved with some bank robbers who give her their money for safe keeping (not a good idea). She then finds the man of her dreams who is traveling the world getting images and messages for his mother on a device he and his father developed which lets the blind see. Meanwhile her ex/not so ex boyfriend (Sam Neal) narrates the tale and chases her around the globe along with a secret agent looking for her new boyfriend. I think the story is interesting and not your usual fare, something different for a change.

A great film by a great director. If you liked Wings of Desire or Buena Vista Social Club, search for this one.  It is in the same league, or perhaps better.

Fused together as one, however, the movie has a forced, discomfiting intimacy, as if Wenders had spliced a set of twins together and called them conjoined. Worth seeing, however, and it also has a great soundtrack.

In his typical manner,  Wenders shows us a lot of beautiful shots. That's it. William Hurt and Sam Neil doing their best, but no good actor can win within a movie of Herrn Wenders. No Way, Jose! "}]
