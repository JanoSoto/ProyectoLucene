He also discovers that he's hearing voices that seem to come from a mysterious craft housed in a NASA hangar.My two cents worth In a time when all the live action Disney movies seem to be a variant on I was normal but just discovered I am/have just been mistaken for royalty/merperson/rock star/leprechaun/etc., this movie from the 1980's is a real breath of fresh air.  The scenario, waking up and discovering that everything except you has changed, and knowing you'll be somebody's idea of a guinea pig for the rest of your life, is instantly relatable and creepy, whether you're a kid or an adult.  The kid fainting, the change in the two brother's relationship due to the age flop, parents trying to protect their son, government trying to exploit the kid's knowledge, everyone's reactions to the situation are all logical and believable.  And who hasn't wanted a chance to fly a saucer?  Having Max, the ship's pilot, be a robot was another stroke of brilliance.  So many movies have the aliens flying all the way here to come visit us face to face.  But if we send machines to other planets because it's cheaper than going ourselves, why wouldn't they?  And having him learn about Earth courtesy of a 12-year-old's TV polluted brain was hysterical.The movie seems a little dated today; but it's forgivable because, like Back to the Future, it's set so specifically in a certain frame of time (you expect it to look and sound like 1986 because, hey, they keep telling you that's when it is.)Recommendations Back to the Future and Big are the two I can think of that are most along these lines.

The film still has presence and the special effects are still quite good even considering they are now near 20 years old. Very impressive and my children are now complete fans of the movie. If you have never seen this film, I would recommend it whole-heartedly for the entire family. If it has been sometime since you watched this film I would say check it out, well worth a return visit.One thing I have to mention is the joy I was receiving just watching my children (ages 4 through 8) experience this movie for the first time. Even after all of the Hi-tech movies they have seen in recent years this movie was still able to capture their attention, hold it and entertain just as well as anything in recent memory (such as Spiderman, Hulk or even Spy Kids).My children wanted to re-watch it immediately after it ended, it was that good in their (short attention span) minds.5 out of 5 stars from me and mine. **Although regarding the DVD transfer, it could have used some extra's, even a trailer from the original film, however there were none, simple menu access and set-up options only, enjoyable none-the-less.

It also falls into a long line of fun 80s sci-fi/adventure family movies.Davey (Joey Cramer) goes into the woods looking for his little brother one evening in 1978. When he wakes up after a brief period of unconsciousness, he turns into a scientific marvel. Nothing is as Davey remembers it, but he can't figure out why because he only fell asleep for a brief period.Davey is told that his parents reported the young boy missing in 1978, the evening that he went searching in the woods for his younger brother, referring to the incident in the past tense because it is 1985. Only Davey is still exactly the same age and everything he was from 1978, while time has passed for everyone else. His little brother is now his big brother (Matt Adler). His parents are old. Everyone is confused and the scientific world find the situation fascinating.The scientists turn Davey into their personal guinea pig, running tests and probing him and all that junk. And soon they discover, that Davey was abducted. Davey, understandably a confused little kid, can't figure out what's going on and he sure doesn't want to be locked up in some lab where people prod at him all day long and tell him very little. So, he breaks lose, and hops aboard the spaceship that took him through time before. While it is an escape from the scientists and their security (briefly), it also holds the answers to what happened to him. It is also an opportunity for Davey to learn everything from this spaceship. And a kid's movie isn't complete without personifying inanimate objects. The spaceship is essentially controlled by Max, which is like it's CPU, a CPU with a cool sense of humor who likewise tries to learn about human emotions and condition from his passenger, Davey. Filmed around Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, it is still a cool movie for kids...teenagers...whatever, having a little bit of something for everyone. Great humor, cool special effects, and the like.

The protagonist is a 12-y/o kid raised, as most are in Western culture, to be incompetent, overly dependent on adults, and untrusting of his own judgment. When he finds himself aboard an alien spacecraft, he naturally first attempts to transfer that dependency to the robotic pilot Max, which, all-seeing eye and all, represents the omniscient grown-up. As time goes on, though, David begins to realize that 1) his own interests do not in fact always coincide with Max's, 2)that therefore he must advocate for himself to achieve a favorable outcome, and 3) that he's the one who has to decide just what outcome will best meet his needs. Much unlike most kid movies, this character shows real growth, and in the end confronts a real moral and personal dilemma. Whether you agree with his choice or not, you have to respect him for what he has become.

I remember young soviet kids flocked into the theaters to see a strange American movie and somehow taped it but too many time has passed and all these years it was like a rather unclear distant memory for me, a distant memory of something pretty good and even beautiful. Since then I was unable to find it and watch it again and only recently I caught in on a cable TV channel. Despite being twenty seven years old now I still liked it a lot.Flight of The Navigator is a very good Sci-fi family movie despite (or some people could say thanks to) it is not as overloaded by the special effects as most of such modern movies. That left enough place not only for pure entertainment bit also for emotions and some pretty nice scenes with rather good dialogs. It the story of an eleven years old boy, who after a strange and quite inexplicable contact with something looked like an alien ship got moved through the time into future several years ago, which passed for him like a couple of hours. In this future he takes an adventure to find an explanation what really happened with him.

One night he sets off into the woods to look for Jeff only to be knocked unconscious when he falls from a ravine. When David awakes in what seems like hours later to him, he discovers actually eight years have passed and it is now 1986. Although he is still twelve years old, the world has moved on and even his little brother is older than he is. NASA are very interested in David when his EEG scan reveal readings in the shape of a UFO they have discovered and other scans of the boy result in star charts of distant galaxies being spewed out from the computers. But our hero is determined to return to his family so he breaks free and hides aboard the UFO which holds the key to everything.Joey Cramer gives a likable performance as David, a boy who enjoys adventures but ultimately just wants to be with his family. I think anyone watching the film would empathise with his character's anger and sense of helplessness when David discovers NASA have no intention of letting him go home. Matt Adler as sixteen-year-old Jeff is another notable actor in the film in the way he depicts his character's uncertainty of dealing with his little big brother and his developing protectiveness towards David. Also, look out for a younger Sarah Jessica Parker.For those who watched 'Flight of the Navigator' as children in the Eighties, there is definitely a nostalgic feeling to it. However, I think children of present day would still enjoy the film as it has a little of everything and issues raised as still relevant and/or interesting today such as pre-teen crushes, annoying kid brothers, the thrill of following a hero on his 'quest', a fun mentor for the hero (even if it is metallic!) and arrogant scientist-types. It is important to remember that this is a children's film aimed very much at an eight- to twelve-year-old demography so it doesn't delve too deeply but the plot is quite unique, the characters are interesting and it is a film that is well put-together. Certainly one to enjoy with the whole family.

I'm not the target audience for this movie and I didn't see it when I was a kid so I'm not looking at it with the warm glow of nostalgia. So I guess I'm going to p!ss some people off with this review.The first half of this movie is, not to mince words, great. Even to my middle-aged jaded eyes it is a great start. Nicely acted, nicely paced, and nicely directed ( I loved the opening shot and the 2 subsequent UFOs that weren't). David, the eldest son of a Standard Disney All American Family, slips and falls whilst in the woods one night. Returning home he finds eight years have passed. Simltaniously an alien Space ship has crashed into a power pylon; later the NASA scientists studying it discover that David has information in his head that directly links him with the alien space ship. They start to analyse the knowledge that has been placed in his brain...Up until this point the movie has been building up a nice eerie edge, The scenes where David is reunited with his family have an emotional punch. There is some real tension building up, tension which dissolves almost immediately Sarah Jessica Parker and her obvious plot device on wheels turns up and is only just being built up again when David enters the ship (via the obvious plot device on wheels) As soon as he steps onto the space ship the whole movie just falls flat on its arse.David just flies about a bit then has the star charts which were (for no apparent reason)pumped into his brain during the missing eight years read by the spaceship who managed to loose his copy while crashing into the power line...? What!? Oh come on! This is stupid. Even for a Disney kids movie, this is stupid stupid stupid film-making. The alien robot ship then turns into a cool talking dude, shows him the other 'samples' one of which eats David's hat then belches (a particularly thin and annoying 'joke' that seems to amuse American movie directors and no one else). David teaches the spaceship about music - a space-faring race that has examined dozens of other sentient species, can speak English, and has never heard of music?. Then they fly about for a bit unable to find Florida. When they do get there, via Japan, David decides that he wants to attempt to travel back in time to 1987. He travels back in time. He doesn't disintegrate. He is reunited with his family for the second time in the movie. Was it all a dream? No! He still has the cute little orphaned alien he picked up with him.OK, maybe I'm being harsh here. It's a kids film after all. But it started out so well. It showed great promise. Then it just copped out the second half of the film is just David flying the ship around. There is no threat, no mystery, no plot, no tension. It's boring. And Max the spaceship was for me,after about 3 minutes, a winner of the prestigious Ja-Ja Binks most Annoying Character in a SF Movie of the Year Award.

I wish I could give two ratings, one from me as a kid (probably an 8 or 9) and then one for me as an adult (probably a 3 or 4 at best). To make the compromise I did a 5.The story is fairly original, and the acting is fine. The spaceship effects hold up relatively well. I like the kid (what else did he do?? I feel like I didn't see him in much else). I don't think this is a spoiler, or hope not anyway, but if you're at all concerned with things like then then read no further. One place that really messes the movie up for me though, is when the alien ship AI personality makes a shift from this kind of cool mysterious robot voice, to the voice of Paul Reubens (AKA Pee-Wee Herman, doing his Pee-Wee Herman voice no less). I felt like as a kid this worked, it was kind of hip and cool and fun. But as an adult, it turns the alien ship into a really annoying character, and I feel a lot less sympathy for everyone involved.

Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography is by James Glennon and Eric McGraw.Young David Freeman (Cramer) is out in the woods near his home in Fort Lauderdale when he falls down a ravine and is knocked unconscious. Waking up he finds that the world around him has advanced by 8 years but he hasn't. After being reunited with his overjoyed parents, it becomes apparent that David has had an encounter with a extra terrestrial life form, which of course greatly interests the authorities...It's a family friendly sci-fi with a difference, in that it doesn't have to take us into space for its tale, yet this in no way detracts from how enjoyable Flight of the Navigator is. It is told from young David's perspective (with Cramer impressionable), thus it firmly engages the kids in the audience. The relationship between David and the Phaleon computer system (Reubens) engages with witty chatter and educational purpose, and the effects work should not be taken for granted either. If we are to be picky then the build up is a touch long before the pic goes extra terrestrial, and Cartwright and De Young are barely given time to impact as parents coming to terms with a family life turned upside down.

Although, there are scenes that I really think are too common in Disney movies. But, I think I can just forgive that. If you are into Disney Family movies, and you are into characters meeting new friends but having to leave them for some reason, you will enjoy this movie. This movie could be the spiritual sequel to E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, along with many other movies that can be it's spiritual predecessor and successor in Disney movies.A 12 year old boy, David Freeman, was on his way to search for his little brother who would be returning from his friends house and would be going to the woods. David's mother thought that would be dangerous, so David should have to get him. David falls into a ditch, only to be awoken eight years later. David finds out that this is all because of some extra terrestrial plot, and he ends up going on a space ship with a robot. This video is fun for the whole family! What's even better, I'm pretty sure that this would be great to look at on a HDTV.What disgusted me, or what I should say I disliked because they weren't really disgusting, was the following scenes I would say. David eventually attempts to teach the robot laughter, music, and the robot eventually reads David's mind and starts talking like a child. This aggravated me and I found the robot to be a little annoying and not very serious. But, I also found this to be quite entertaining. Eventually, the robot will get back to his normal self in the end, but at the very end, the robot talks like a child again. I also hated that this featured annoying words such as, dork, geek, etc. But, you should remember that this was in the 1980s and this is a Disney movie.I recommend this movie for all. Well, not for all. There are a few cussing, but it's not common. So far, I remember hearing the SH word and probably even the D word that ends with mn, and I've also heard the word Hell. If you don't want to have to spend a few seconds or a minute explaining to your child what that is, don't bother letting that child watch this movie or just don't tell that child what it means.

I know it probably realistically pulls off a 8/10 MAX (no Pun intended) but for myself and for anyone who can let go of their reality and witness a terrific science fiction adventure as though you were 12 years old will not be disappointed. The Flight of The Navigator was dead center of the eighties film craze that saw brilliant sci-fi fantasy epics like Star Trek movies, Back To The Future, Short Circuit, E.T., Batteries Not Included, Gremlins...the eighties was a film genre of it's own. This film fits right into that genre perfect and delivers an experience unlike anything ever seen. This was before the days of CGI enhanced films and special effects that were computer generated and in a day and age where things had to be done by hand and puppets. Director Randal Kleiser did something amazing with the budget, effects, cast and story and created a mesmerizing adventure that I think is one of his more under rated works next to his hit cult classics Grease and The Blue Lagoon.Young star Joey Cramer does a brilliant job as David Freeman, the older brother and typical 'almost' teenager who is sent into a terrifying and yet amazing world where everyone around him has aged nearly ten years except him and he meets a friend that's out of this world. Cramer is in some ways the typical 'Disney' kid. But anyone can relate to him and his world and they do such an amazing job of capturing how this experience would feel finding yourself launched ten years into the future but having not aged a single day. You'll recognize regular character actors Veronica Cartwright and Cliff De Young as David's parents, both of them doing a great job with their smaller roles and carrying the incredible effect of having aged past their son. A young and very cute Sarah Jessica Parker plays the friendly Carolyn McAdams who befriends David at the NASA research facility, and Howard Hesseman is decent in his small role as the lead researcher at NASA who wants to study and protect David at once. Matt Adler is David's older brother but younger technically. Finally although credited at the end as 'Paul Mall' Trimaxion (or Max as he's known) is voiced by none other than Paul 'Pee Wee' Reubans who you can't miss as the voice. Nowadays the voice of Pee Wee Herman comes across as almost annoying and is more of a bad joke than anything but this film was released when Pee Wee Herman was all the rage and Reubans was a star to children. I almost found Max's voice annoying this time around but it never bothered me as a kid. Most of the parts in the film with the exception of David and Max are fairly small but everyone does a great job and carry the film wonderfully.One of the truly brilliant things about Flight of The Navigator is their is NO antagonist, no villains. There are perhaps character with questionable motives but the entire film works without a villain. Instead the film relies on the quest for this boy to find his place in a world moved on without him and to figure out where he's been. Scenes of true brilliance include the actual flight once the ship escapes, the creatures inside Max all waiting to be returned home, and Max and David swaying and dancing to The Beach Boys...all classic Disney film. The Flight of The Navigator is a sure fire hit with kids and kids at heart. If you've never taken in the adventure...well you need to!! 9/10 "},{"Title":"Pleasant landing","Date":"18 August 2008","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" I watched this on television, seemingly cut for such.

The plot isn't bad, and they did employ an actual scientific theory. The pacing is remarkable, this flows and flies smoothly. The writing is good and consistent, albeit viewers are required to accept stuff that strains suspension of disbelief. The humor is plentiful, with no overdone gags or jokes, if repetition and silliness(I could have done without the gross-out material, even if there isn't that much of it, and the fact that it was confined to a single scene) are apparent throughout this, and the entire thing, partially also clear in the tone, while that isn't that bothersome, is directed at children. I must admit that it is done with care. The cinematography and editing are talented. The effects are fantastic, and not just for the time, with realistic reflection and fluid motion. There is a little language in it, maybe harsh at least considering who its intended audience is. There is nothing else that parents may deem inappropriate for their offspring, save for a couple of actions that can be imitated(and definitely shouldn't be).

It was later determined that all of its starcharts and artificial intelligence have escaped into David's brain.  A team of NASA scientists led by Dr. Faraday (Howard Hesseman) is determined to research the connection between the alien ship and the time travelling David.  Will David remain a lab rat for the rest of his life, or will he escape to freedom?  There's only one way to find out, and that is by watching the movie.  Perhaps there are several themes to this movie.  Many families have lived with the tragedy of missing their children, and retrieving them is an arduous and time consuming task that often goes unfulfilled.  It can also be seen as a story of alienation someone mired in 1978 may face if he were to suddenly awake in 1986.  During those eight years, as David learned, his family moved and aged, Jimmy Carter was voted out of office, Starsky and Hutch went off the air, four new kinds of Coca-Cola hit the shelves, some girls began to dye their hair purple, and an all-male group named Twisted Sister replaced the Bee Gees as the most popular band of the time.  Take note of the cameo appearances of Sarah Jessica Parker as NASA assistant Carolyn McAdams, and of Paul Reubens as the voice of Max.  To answer your question, Chad Perman, Joey Cramer is alive and well and living in Vancouver.  Having visited South Florida several times, I can add one last message of the movie.  It really does feel like eight years when you travel up the I-95 instead of taking the Turnpike!

Not much has changed in the years since, as this is still a cool, fun kid's adventure film, perhaps not as in depth or as well made as Joe Dante's EXPLORERS but nevertheless a firm staple of a 1980s childhood.The storyline is split into two halves, and the first half actually turns out to be an intriguing mystery about a boy who suffers a fall in the woods and who wakes up to discover eight years have mysteriously disappeared. Joey Cramer makes for a likable lead; maybe he's not the best actor in the world but I found myself caring about and identifying with his character.After this set-up, the second half lets rip with an exhilarating fantasy set piece in which the lad takes a journey around the world in a really cool-looking UFO. There are some excellent special effects here and plenty of humour thanks to the reliably strange Paul Reubens in a voice performance. It's all very lightweight but no less entertaining because of it. Sarah Jessica Parker turns up in an early supporting role and Veronica Cartwright (ALIEN) is as good value as ever playing the kid's stressed-out mother.

Meanwhile Dr. Louis Faraday (Howard Hesseman) is investigating a crashed UFO. David seems to have a connection to the ship. Faraday convinces the family to allow David to go with him by his lonesome. Carolyn McAdams (Sarah Jessica Parker) is a low level worker at the secret facility who befriends David.There is a moment where this movie goes off the tracks a little. Faraday is able to convince David and his family to allow him to go off to a secret base with strangers all by himself. It's crazy unbelievable. No parents would ever do that without guns pointed at their heads especially for a 12 year old who's been missing for 8 years and presumed dead. I get the appeal of having the kid by himself in a strange environment. It raises the tension but does it in an unreasonable way. The core of the movie is a fascinating children's sci-fi fantasy.

When someone said the title, it sounded to me like How to Fight an Alligator. That made no sense to little old me, since I couldn't imagine why anyone would attempt to fight an alligator (I later found out that people DO in fact fight alligators, but I'm not going to try that).Anyway, the scenes that registered in my mind were the boy looks for his brother and gets scared when someone jumps out of the tree; the boy returns home and finds a different family there; the boy hides in the machine to board the alien ship; the boy says I promise and the voice says Don't know promise; the boy calls the voice a geek; the voice says You called me a geek!; the boy wakes up again in the forest. Overall, I found it as entertaining as a six-year-old would find it.I later learned that the movie's title was Flight of the Navigator. Now that I'm an adult, I've now seen it again. I found it to be one fun movie, the sort of thing that anyone would love to experience. Obviously I now recognize a young Sarah Jessica Parker.

This is simply stuff that the kids will enjoy watching. It tells the entire story from the viewpoint of a 12 year old boy, which means that the entire perception of the world and the people that are living in it are also costumed to that of a 12 year old. And I like that in all honesty. It's what makes this a good kids movie, which makes me wish more movies would had picked this approach. Hollywood these days seems to have no idea what kids like and how they should market and make movies for them. Just go back to some '80's movies and take notes.But having said all that, this movie is definitely not a great one. It had really a potentially great and adventurous concept but the movie did far too little with all of it. There is just not a whole lot happening in this movie movie. Story- and character-wise it's a quite poorly developed one. There is no villain, there is no real danger or conflict and the good original ideas that this movie had did not get developed or wrapped up properly. If the entire movie had been more like its first half the movie and its story could had really gone somewhere good and interesting. It could had been an E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial kind of movie, which this movie also seemed to have been really 'inspired' by in the first place. But instead of developing some more depth and interesting real emotions, the movie decides that it would be fun to set the movie aboard a spaceship, that's flying around the world, without ever letting anything exciting or tense happen.The story just doesn't make much sense. Not that that seems to matter much for a kids movie but it of course does. Children are not stupid and they just don't take anything for granted, which is something this movie doesn't really always seem to take in consideration with its story. They didn't put enough effort in it, which makes the movie a mostly bland one.Nevertheless the movie remains a fun, light one, especially for kids, since of its approach, that tells the story from the viewpoint and perspective of an 12 year old. Therefore I can say that the movie serves its purpose and for the right audience it's simply being a good one.It's also a real decent looking one. It's a Disney movie, who always knows how to spend some real money on these type of movies. The fact that this movie had the money and the backing of a big studio behind them means that this movie can do more than the usual average one, within this genre. They did not only got some big name actors to star in this movie but they also spend some money on its good looking effects. When you take into consideration that this is an 1986 movie. you have to conclude that the special effects in this movie were being quite good for its time. So nothing wrong with its cast or crew basically.It's good and entertaining enough throughout, especially for kids but yet it seemed to had some far more potential, which got wasted by a below par and not adventurous or fun enough script.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}{"Title":"Randal Kleiser is a great director!","Date":"10 January 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" The first time I saw this movie, I was about ten years old.

I was surprised that it was a Disney movie as most Disney films are pretty well advertised but I had never heard of this before. A Disney family film geared for kids wouldn't have brought me into a theater to see it anyway so if I did hear about I just dismissed it and forgot about it.

Considering that Disney's Hollywood Pictures division released Powder, directed by a convicted and confessed child molester, Disney should show some backbone and restore Reubens real name to the credits.If you can get ahold of this movie, see it -- and maybe Disney will see fit to release it again -- on DVD, I hope.

I looked at it again yesterday and I taught that it did look a bit old but there is still a kind of nostalgia about it that make it charming. This is a real 80's film ,the music,the costumes,the special effects and the story make you  think of the colorful day's were the gremlins were famous,Michael Jackson was black and E.T was the most popular film ever made and I do not complain about it,I love that kind of films. Talking about the 80's,you might think that film was a rip off of many films of the golden years(Because they were a lot of films about kids leaving a big adventure at the time like the goonies,the neverending story...)But it wasn't,the film is actually quite original. The great thing about this film is that the story is more interesting than many other kids film ,that means an adult can look at it without being bored. But I still recommend that film mostly to people who are real 80's fans.best scene When David see is aged parent,for him it's been four hours he did'nt see them(imagine how weird it must be.).I also have to say that Sarah Jessica Parker is very cute in that film.

Throw in the evil government men from E.T. and some inexplicable slo-mo shots of dogs catching frisbees, and you've got a kid fantasy film that feels like stepping into a wormhole back to the mid-eighties. And that nostalgic shot in the arm is what makes this film quirkily enjoyable, at least for me. Takes me back to the early days of watching mid-afternoon cable. But it's interesting watching this as an adult (& a parent, no less), because I found myself more engaged by the mystery surround David's sudden reappearance after he's been missing for 8 years. The kid's found his way into NASA's labs and brain machines, his head full of as-yet-undiscovered star charts ... and then the story switches gears, and the kid's absconded with the strange spacecraft that NASA's gotten its hands on. Now it's a buddy road movie as the kid and the talking space ship bond over Beach Boys songs.But it's a lightweight Disney movie, and that's where it delivers. Add the very cute (and pre-horse days) Sarah Jessica Parker and the synth score extravaganza (from the highly versatile and fresh-off-of-Back to the Future Alan Silvestri), and it's pure family fluff. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"80's Childhood Classic!","Date":"20 May 2012","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" Joey Cramer, Cliff De Young, Veronica Cartwright and Howard Hesseman star in this 1986 sci-fi film.

That's because I found elements in common with the films in question. Not the most original movie, then...While not tremendous, I prefer this anytime over that mediocrity called 'Grease'. This comparison only takes place because both were directed by the same person.This is the story of David Scott Freeman (decently but not greatly played by Joey Cramer, a Henry Thomas look-alike), an American 12-year-old boy who lives in 1978. In one Summer night, he mysteriously ends up in the year 1986 after a fall. Naturally, he finds out that everything around him is no longer the same. He panics and falls in despair because he doesn't understand what is going on. Although he is taken to his family, he is the only one who hasn't aged at all.David is taken to medical examinations to find out why he has the same age after 8 years but is forced to stay more 48 hours, to which he reluctantly agrees. Meanwhile, he finds out that he has to stay longer than the promised 48 hours and he can't take it anymore and that's when his journey to return to his family begins... with the help of a talking time-machine nicknamed Max by him.Overall, it's an okay movie although a little sappy. Despite its faults, it gives a feeling of nostalgia. A movie like this could have been made in no other time but the 80's.

He awakes shortly after to find his parents gone from their home, and everything changed. When the police eventually locate his parents and re-unite them, it turns out that they reported David missing eight years ago. He is examined by doctors, but his brain starts to transmit images of an alien spacecraft directly into the computers. When NASA hear about it, they are quick to take David away for further tests, after a craft was discovered crashed into power lines. They soon learn that David's head is filled with information about the outer reaches of space, and David feels like he is being beckoned by something hidden in the confines of NASA.This was an obvious favourite of mine as a child, as it was for many of my generation. Whilst I was re-watching, I was surprised by two things. The first is that I remembered next to nothing about the opening 45 minutes or so, yet as soon as David became the Navigator, it all came flooding back to me. And the second was that I couldn't believe how genuinely good the first half was. Playing out like an early Spielberg sci-fi, where all the grown-ups are suspicious and shady with their suits and broken promises, it builds slowly and is actually quite riveting in parts. The second half, however, although fun, just doesn't play well alongside the mature opening half. It introduces Max (voiced by Pee-Wee Herman himself, Paul Reubens - here named as Paul Mall), who after bonding with David, develops a silly voice and annoying laugh, a la Pee-Wee Herman.It is quite ironic that what I loved about the film as a child is now the thing that I feel ultimately lets it down. Maybe I have become a grumpy old man at the ripe old age of 27. It doesn't completely ruin the film, just brings it down a peg. It's very disappointing, as the need to seemingly dumb down to appeal to a young audience being fed on quality like The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Crystal and E.T. The Extra Terrestrial around the same period just feels unnecessary. Not that it would have touched on those films, but it still could have been very good nonetheless. But apart from the sudden change of tone, this is a childhood favourite for a reason - it is fun, imaginative, and has a sympathetic hero in Joey Cramer's David. And if a film can survive an early appearance from one of cinema's true monsters, Sarah Jessica Parker, then good on it.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"What was the name of the Puckmarin?","Date":"25 January 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" I remember watching this film when I was young I loved it!

If you like the kind of genres that I mentioned above, but haven't seen this movie, I suggest you give it a try.I had forgotten that Sarah Jessica Parker was in this movie, fresh from her Square Pegs look.

I am surely going to go out and rent it to remember it.

The story is very good and very well executed. I saw this maybe 15 years ago and I still like this movies' idea and story after seeing the likes of the Matrix and other classic Sci-fi movies. After David (Cramer) falls and blacks out, he returns home as if nothing has happened. He goes home to continue with his daily activities. But he finds a lot of shocking changes when he gets back home! The best part was when David (Cramer) returns home and the folks take for a long lost kid or ghost! That was amazing. The UFO and aliens/visitors-from-space addition were also beautifully plotted and executed. The scene where the ship moves above the sea and dives right into the sea still lingers in my mind. The design of the 'being' inside the ship was also far ahead of its time. Far far ahead of its time.

It is packed with comedy, action, and even some heart touching parts.  In this film, David (Joey Cramer) has found himself bound in a vicous cycle of time.  While He has only aged 4 hours, the rest of the world has aged 8 years.  David soon finds out that he has been taken to Phaelom at the speed of light and has landed in the year 1986.  Then D. Faraday (Howard Hesseman), an official from NASA, discovers Davids situation and wants to keep david and run tests on him.  What David doesn't know is that Dr.Faraday has found the spaceship (Max) and is keeping it in a top security hangar.  David stumbles on the space ship and gives Max the star charts Max has stored in Davids brain.  Max promises to take David home.  An exciting movie it is indeed.  You'll have to see the movie to see how it turns out.  Again this is one of those films that Disney put out in 1986 and it has been aired on Sci-Fi and Television.  If you've seen this movie, I recommend you check out the 1987 movie Earth Star Voyager on IMDB.

I remember when it came on TV on Sunday night as a part of the Wonderful World of Disney (aired a new family movie every Sunday night on either CBS or ABC). I taped the movie and over the last 18 years I've nearly destroyed the tape from watching it so much! One of my favorite scenes is when David figures out how to fly the spacecraft. Watching the craft transform from Stage 1 to Stage 3 created so many dreams and fantasies for me as a child. Regarding the 80's in general, I love the special effects. True acting died with the invention of super-computer generated effects and only in the movies made in the 80's were the actors capable of portraying the story line purely through true acting. I'm so glad it has come out on DVD; it will remain one of my favorite movies (among a list of other 80's movies) for all time!

The whole movie just interested me. I think it's because at the time I had a fascination for flying saucers and aliens. Plus I thought it would be like E.T which I loved at the time as well.Flight of the Navigator may be pretty old now. But I think it still remains a true classic for children who love fantasy movies. Flight of the Navigator will always interest and amaze a young childs mind despite it's age.It may have not been a block buster hit at the time.

The police bring him to your house but tell you that there's something unusual about this case, and then he shows you your son.He hasn't aged a day since the day he was lost.Great movie idea B An alien spaceship lands outside your gas station.  That's not what strikes you as weird.  A human kid rushes out asking for directions and where the phone is.  That's a little off.  A robot eye pops out of the ship and greets the kid on his way back in, then addresses you with the voice of Pee-Wee Herman.  They take off into the sky.

I gave it a 10 and the reason why is 'cause i just met Joey Cramer. I always loved Flight of the Navigator but i never knew the actors name who played the main character, i saw the movie when it opened 2x and then again on T.V a few times and even had a crush on him but never paid attention to what his name was, i just knew i loved the movie and the actor. Growing up i would ask myself I wonder what happened to that kid from Flight of the Navigator. Well now i know, I was introduced to him as Joe by my Fiancé and didn't think anything i saw him as just another guy that was really down to earth, sweet and kinda shy although he looked really familiar.A few days later visiting my Fiancé, his friend asked me if i had ever seen Flight of the Navigator, i asked why and he told me that the guy Joe that i had met was the kid from the movie and right away i went up to Joe who was in the next room and asked him and it was true not only 'cause he said so but comparing facts and pics. on the internet i know it's true. He looks basically the same, i remembered him being chubby so i thought he had lost weight but i just bought the movie and watched it again and he's pretty skinny there, hes now got some muscle though. I was so excited about finding out it was him but he doesn't like to talk about his life back then, he wants his privacy. After he did Flight of the Navigator he had a hard life and is now trying to make it better so that's all i'm gonna say about him.In regards to the movie i loved it when i was a child and still do although i remembered it differently and it seemed a lot shorter now too. It's perfect for the whole family and it's not boring. I don't think it was digitally remastered though but the effects are still good. I gave this movie a 10 on the basis that i know Joe but even if i hadn't met him i still give it a 10 because it really was good, to me it's one of the classics for kids in the 80's.

Well, let's see.....there were two s-words, one bast--d, one GD, one Jesus, etc. etc - yes, this was a Disney film. In addition to the profanity that had not been in Disney films of the past, it had a stupid, annoying 12-year-old brat in the lead and enough holes in the story to start the proverbial swiss cheese factory. It was just plain dumb.Thankfully, new owners put this company back on track with some higher-quality films in the next decade. This film was a disgrace. "},{"Title":"One of the ugliest collisions of Disney and sci-fi","Date":"27 May 2007","Score":"3 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi","Review":" As one of the sites linked to this IMDb entry states, one of Disney's first business-driven forays into live-action film drove the film industry in a new direction. It was the first time that the science fiction genre was treated in an adult manner. From then on, Disney and science fiction had a relationship that was occasionally interesting, but as examples like Flight Of The Navigator demonstrate, usually quite abyssic. Part of the problem is the clash of messages, but the real problem lies in the same place as the problem every film of this mould, the adult genre brought to child sensibilities, lies. Namely, the film aims at children and makes the assumption that because its audience is made up of children, it can treat that audience with less respect. If anything, the children of the 1980s were an even more sophisticated audience than the children of the present, and thus, Flight Of The Navigator was firmly ignored at the box office. It was pretty much ignored on the then-maturing home video market, too, come to think of it.Part of the problem is that Flight is not just ignorant of the culture of both eras represented. It goes to absurd lengths to insult it. While I grant that I was barely two months old at the end of 1978, I know enough about the time to know that a twelve year old of the era would experience far less culture-shock when teleported to 1986 than would be the case if he were teleported to 2006. This is hilariously ignored in the moment when the protagonist meets a glorified janitor, played by an incredibly young (but still staggeringly ugly) Sarah Jessica Parker. While the existence of multiple Coca-Cola varieties in 1986 would surprise any visitor from the 1970s, music video was in fact quite an intrinsic marketing tool well before 1978, with a variety of artists such as Black Sabbath or David Bowie using the medium to an effect that was almost half as artistic (or just as much in the latter's case) as their music. One viewing of the promo video for John, I'm Only Dancing will confirm this much.It is important to keep this in mind during such scenes as when David is educating Max about music. As I sit here and listen to a song that consists of a grinding bass guitar overlaid with one of the most instantly-recognisable drum patterns and a violin that brings tears to the eyes as the vocalist roars in Latin about what is essentially the story of a man being tortured to death, I realise that scene will never fail to creep me out. Given that Max is capable of travelling through time, across light years of space, and has enough memory to store the complete works of Ian Fleming a million times over, I can only think of one response such an entity would have to a child like David. At one point in the conversation, I see Max telling him to grow the hell up. At another, I see Max ditching David in complete annoyance. For certain, it would be another ten years before the Internet did to cultural hegemony what television did to the film industry, but pity for ignorance is soon replaced by anger when the exhibitor mistakes it for something to take pride in.Furthering the problem is a voice performance by Paul Reubens, or Paul Mall as he is credited here. Quite honestly, if someone had directed me to deliver a voice-over as screechy, irritating, and nonsensical as was the case here, I would be making certain that nobody knew I was involved. For the most part, it seems to be the script's fault, but at a moment after Max extracts data he placed in David's head for reasons that make no sense using a process that makes no sense for reasons that make no sense, Paul feels the need to shout/scream every line. If you go and buy an elderly pig, set it in your back yard, then stab it to death with a butter knife, you will get some idea of the kind of sound I am talking about. It hurts to listen to, and when you combine that with the horrid tone of the script, it only makes me hate the film even more. I often joke that people who block lines in supermarkets out in suburban or rural towns should be dumped in the Los Angeles CBD for a day. Well, David really deserves to be left in the middle of Los Angeles circa 2007 for a year or three.Does this mean that the film is a total write-off? Well, there are a couple of saving graces such as Howard Hesseman as a scientist who only seeks to find a rational explanation for David's disappearance, or Matt Adler as the elder version of David's brother. In contrast to Parker or Joey Cramer, they are endearing and create characters one can sympathise with. Not that this bothered Disney accountants during production. Who cares if the protagonist is a narrow-minded little twerp who revolts the most stratified segments of the potential audience, right? Well, given that The Goonies was released a year earlier, made twenty times the money, and was given the red carpet treatment on DVD recently, I think history has rendered its verdict on this nauseating load of family friendly syrup. In some commentaries about films, I have said that it is rare when a film that claims to be appealing to audiences of that mythical every age really does so. In case I have not already made it clear, Flight Of The Navigator makes the claim when in fact it does the exact opposite.Flight Of The Navigator is a two out of ten film, personnified. "}]
