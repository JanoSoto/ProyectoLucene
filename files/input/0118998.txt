[{"Title":"Amusing lines but weak plot","Date":"2 October 2003","Score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  John Dolittle was a worrying child &#150; his father always caught him pretending to talk to animals and eventually had to get him to stop it.  As an adult, his gift is long forgotten until he hits a dog with his car and hears it talk to him.  When he realises that he is not going crazy and he can talk to them he is suddenly inundated with animals to treat, his family is falling apart and his business partners think their whole business is at risk.Eddie Murphy basically rebuild his career around a couple of big comedy remakes which relied on humour and effects.  Here the humour consists of good lines and the effects the animatronic animals.  The plot is the weakest point of the film and, although it has a basic story, it never really involves or becomes important.  Supporting the film then is some funny lines (rather than consistent jokes) from the animal support cast &#150; whether it be main characters (Rodney the hamster) or quick one-liners (`I am Kyser Soze').The effects are surprisingly ropey &#150; they look good but they don't move naturally and the cuts between the real animals and the puppets are very clear.  The support cast basically carry the movie and save it from being pretty dire stuff.  Rock, Brooks, MacDonald, Leguizamo, Shandling etc all do good work and their dialogue basically consists of one-liners rather than anything else.  Beside this the adult cast look like straight men.  Murphy is quite dull and even the likes of Platt and Boyle (who usually do OK in small roles) have little to do.Overall this is fun to watch simply because of the support cast and the regular sharp lines of dialogue from the animals.  However, look for any more than that and you'll be disappointed.

Eddie Murphy is, in my opinion, trounced in the movie by Chris Rock as the out-of-control hamster. I almost wish that they could have had more scenes with both Eddie Murphy and Ossie Davis (yes, Ossie Davis went so far as to take a role in this movie).So, this movie's nothing special, but pretty funny nonetheless.

I think I liked it a lot at the time, and watched it again a few months later. After many years, I just decided to check it out again. Since I'm obviously not as easily amused as I was when I was twelve, and was aware that it generally wasn't considered that great, I didn't have very high expectations. Afterwards, however, I certainly can't say that I think it's as bad as some do.During his childhood, John Dolittle talks to animals. It seems that he can understand them, and they can understand him, but when his dad sees this, he thinks it's ridiculous. After John's dog is taken away, he is obviously not happy, and stops talking to animals for a long time. When he grows up, he becomes a physician, and has a wife and two daughters. It seems that Dr. Dolittle's communication with animals is long gone, but one night, after he nearly runs over a dog on the road, he hears it say something! Now, his childhood ability has come back, and soon, he finds many different types of creatures following him around! How will people be able to believe that he actually has this remarkable gift, and that it's not just a mental illness, as one would probably assume?! As you would probably expect, this movie has its fair share of lame jokes (such as a rat farting), and like you've probably already heard, the movie would overall appeal more to kids than anyone else. However, certainly not all of the gags are lame. During my most recent viewing, I wouldn't have been surprised if I had kept a straight face through the entire thing, but that's not what happened. I found no huge laughs in the film, but there were several times when I smiled and snickered. I also found that the story gets suspenseful to some degree towards the end. Eddie Murphy's performance is also a highlight. Some of the voice-overs for the animals are silly, maybe the majority of them, but this isn't much of a problem.For kids, this movie could be very funny, though it is somewhat crude at times, remember the PG-13 rating. So, I don't know how appropriate for kids it is (that's for parents to decide). For adults, and probably adolescents, this version of Doctor Dolittle is certainly nothing special. It could be mildly amusing, if you don't mind extreme silliness and crude toilet humour, but there's probably also a fair chance that you would find it absolutely revolting (I think some clearly have). Without a doubt, this movie is pretty cheesy, and skipping it wouldn't be a great loss for most people, but it's certainly not one that I advise everyone to avoid at all costs (though that would probably be a good idea for some people).

Oh, for sure it's not so great, either. But Eddie Murphy alone makes it something worth watching (he's one of the few perfect-pitch comedians out there). And the story, a 1920 classic for children, is something of its own.What falls apart is the slightly pushy sentimentalism and the generally mediocre secondary cast. That might be enough to push it into mediocrity, for sure, but it's not meant to be a deep classic, and it plays with the story nicely.That story is not just about a doctor (of the human type) who can hear animals talking. It's more about how society condemns hims and tries to help him with psycho-care. His bland wife (with the gorgeous eyes that get overplayed) is typical of his friends, all nice people with distractions and no time for the possibility that he might, in fact, hear animals talk.The talking animals are of course great fun, from the rats to the tiger. This is the part of the movie that is meant to appeal across the board, and it does, including its good special effects. The feeling of family, not dysfunctional, is another bit of warmth, not to mention that the family is African American, a nice twist on the original story based on an English doctor.And though the movie was not liked by critics, it has made a third of a billion dollars, which speaks for itself. Not a masterpiece, and not even a classic, it still has wonderful aspects including a very wonderful basic concept.

John Dolittle (Murphy) can talk to the animals and they can talk to him.  At least he/they could when he was a kid.  His dad thought he was nuts and though the use of an exorcist and some stern fatherly persuasion John looses or suppresses his talent/curse. When we next see John, he is Dr. Dolittle, M.D, happily married, father of two girls.  He's a respected partner in a very successful medical practice and is about to become very rich.  He and his partners are about to sell to an HMO.  Everything seems to be going great until Dr. Dolittle almost gets into a car accident with a dog.  A bump on his head brings back the voices.  Is he going nuts, are life's stresses too much, or does Dr. John just need to find his inner child?The rest is a rather silly man-gets-in-touch-with-soul type movie, except for the animals.  They have all the good lines.  There's the lascivious German shepherd that can't control himself even when he's pleading his reformation on the way to being clipped.  The pigeon couple; she's a nag, he's a wimp.  There are the quarreling rats, the neurotic terrier, the tiger, and of course Lucky, the dog Dr. Dolittle hit in the car accident.  To his credit Murphy let's the animals have their say while he plays straight man to their lines.  One other thing about Murphy's acting; Dr. Dolittle is not the least bit comfortable around animals.  When Dr. Dolittle has to catch daughter Maya's (Pratt) guinea pig, he holds it in a folded pillow so he doesn't have to touch it.  (Having similar feelings about pets, I was amused by Dr. Dolittle's behavior around animals.)  What's funny about this is, apparently Murphy wasn't acting.  But this all added up to a fun movie.

He does such a wonderful family film here that it's almost hard to believe he got his start on Saturday Night Live. The mere concept of talking with the animals is created quite believably in the film even though you have to consider the detail that would go into such a feat actually existing. Considering the sheer diversity of the animal kingdom and the limited scope of animals to rationalize, Murphy as Dolittle would have to have considerable telepathic and clairvoyant prowess as well the data-crunching power of a computer in order to decipher instantly the motivations and inclinations of two to three animals at one time as well as come up with the human equivalent of the animal's personality. The concept of animals conversing inter-species wise would have to involve some sort of Mother Earth Theory that all animals wild and domesticated are linked by a central innate consciousness. That said, this movie is quite enjoyable despite the theories and examination it entails. Actress Kristen Wilson as Murphy's wife is a very lovely presence to the movie and former child actress Raven-Symone is becoming a lovely young actress herself far removed from that annoyingly unbearable kid she played on The Cosby Show. The rest of the cast are second stringers to the animal cast whose voices are brought to life by the vocal talents of Norm MacDonald, Julie Kavner, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Jenna Elfman, Gilbert Gottfried and sounding eerily like James Belushi, Albert Brooks. This is one wonderful movie that belongs in your video collection at home.

This film is basically a remake, minus the songs, and while it isn't brilliant and no masterpiece in any shape or form, it does have its good things. The film's plot is very slight, and the script has its weak spots while having some funny ones as well. And there is sometimes uneven pacing and direction. But it is nicely filmed, and the music is nice enough. The acting was also pretty good. Eddie Murphy does a serviceable job as John Dolittle, his role is not really like the ones he had in Beverly Hills Cop or Trading Places which also happens to two of his better movies, but he does well, and I will say he has been worse and he's been in worse films too. Kyla Pratt looks lovely and acts nicely as Maya, and Ossie Davis is good as well. The voice cast carry the picture as the animals who (along with the above average effects) steal the show. Consisting of the likes of Garry Shandling, John Leguizamo and Gilbert Gottfried they do great jobs, however Oliver Platt and Peter Boyle have little to do.

The whole Dolittle bit of the name kind of gives the impression that he is lazy but in this film it is just the formula driven screenwriter. Plot is crammed together with the animals stealing the show. Among them is Lucky the dog who uses the toilet and blows his nose. He is nearly mashed by Murphy's car and becomes one of the family. Director Betty Thomas previously made the far superior Private Parts as well as the about as inferior The Brady Bunch Movie. She never establishes these jokes regarding animals with inhuman tendencies and they greater spiral the film down into the deepest of kitty litter proportions. Murphy seems to be the ideal choice for this role but after the premise is established it is just a one joke charade with Murphy reacting to the chaos. Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt and Peter Boyle are stuck in cardboard supporting roles. Special effects are similar to Babe but unlike that wonderful film Doctor Dolittle doesn't have a story to sell. It is another example of filmmakers cashing in of the success of yesteryear but creating a big budget and over-hyped dog show.

Eddie Murphy has his legions of fans and I he definitely does not disappoint in this movie.Though this is a great movie, there is little depth to it. This does not mean that it is flawed in that way for not all movies need depth. This is not a feel good movie, nor is it satirical, it is simply an Eddie Murphy comic routine. One thing I wondered though is if the Pushme-Pullyou would be in the movie (for those who do not know, the Pushme-Pullyou if a two headed Llama with its second head where its butt should be). It makes a cameo appearance walking behind Dr Dolittle and you see its reflection in the mirror. It is not a major part of the movie, and I don't think it is meant to be. All I can remember of the old books is that Dolittle had a legion of animal followers, and he wasn't Negro.

But seeing as I haven't watched anything for ages, I figured that a little light relief might not be such a bad thing. And like most of Eddie Murphy's back catalogue, light relief is exactly what was on the menu. While maybe not a patch on the original, it is a great family film that has plenty for kids of all ages to enjoy even if it does have its flaws.Murphy plays work-committed doctor John Dolittle, working in an inner-city practise and occasionally finding the time to spend with his wife (Kristen Wilson) and two daughters (Raven-Symoné and Kyla Pratt). But after nearly running a dog over, he is shocked to recall his forgotten childhood ability to talk and communicate with animals. And as word spreads around the animal kingdom, Dolittle struggles with his sanity as every cat, rat and horse in the area flock to him for medical advice. He also struggles to persuade his family and colleagues about his claims, just as his practise is about to merge in a big-money deal.Murphy, by now in the middle of the end of his career, doesn't need to try too hard but actually, he is surprisingly good as the increasingly demented doctor. Maybe because he doesn't have to slap on several thousand dollars worth of latex or play every character in the movie but Doctor Dolittle serves as a reminder that he can be an accomplished performer without going completely over the top like he does nowadays. However, Murphy is no match for the variety of animals acting alongside him and even though the animals actually talk through clever and discreet CG, the numerous voices and guest stars (Chris Rock, Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Julie Marge Simpson Kavner and more) have all the best lines and make the movie genuinely entertaining. The humour is suitable for a family film - great for kids, mildly amusing for grown-ups - but it does take a while to get going and for some reason, the ending didn't feel particularly satisfying.What it lacks in songs, dance routines and Rex Harrision, it makes up for in characterisation and humour. Doctor Dolittle might not change the world but it is perfect family fare to slap on a slow Sunday afternoon when the weather prevents play outside and you're fed up of hearing them on their Playstations. The only problems I can think of is that it lacks the charm of the original, it could have made more of the premise and the whole thing isn't especially memorable, Murphy's performance aside. But at least he isn't anything like as annoying as he is these days and just like Steve Martin in Father Of The Bride, this film acts almost as a tribute to a former comedian and actor before they decide to ruin their career with some shocking films. So if you're still recovering from the likes of Pluto Nash or Norbitt then I advise you to watch this because if anything else, this is an Eddie Murphy film that doesn't make you want to blow up Hollywood.

So if you want your kids to settle for second best and, as a result, drag you to mediocre kiddy-fair after mediocre kiddy-fair (which, in the age of The Cat in the Hat is pretty bad) let 'em have Eddie Murphy. But if you want your kids to have taste and appreciate a quality piece of film-making, rent this film immediately. Even if you have no kids, buy it, rent it, whatever.

Eddie Murphy's declining career not withstanding, this is actually fun to watch. Although this work falls far from the Beverly Hills Cop tree, and does not quite match the quality of any of his pre-1995 films, it still holds some entertainment value, however mild it may be.It is a modernized version, of course, of Rex Harrison's 1967 classic, but without the charm, the sophistication, or the talent. Unfortunately, while this remake is fun, it is only mildly so, and really quite silly in a wholly unimaginative kind of way. Frankly, the best bit was Norm MacDonald's Lucky voice part. Eddie Murphy's best post-1995 roles have been voice parts, in my opinion (Donkey & Mushu).The young actresses who play Murphy's daughters are great in their own rights; Raven-Symone and Kyla Pratt, the latter of which continues on with this franchise long after the rest have bailed, creating a nice outlet for her own growing talents. Check them out.All in all, this is fun, if only mildly so, and totally silly. The kids will love it.It rates a 5.8/10 from...the Fiend .

When very much to his surprise, a long suppressed talent comes to life once again.  As a child, John could talk to animals, particularly his pet dog.  One day his dog attacked someone and was immediately taken away. From this day on, he vowed to no longer talk to animals.  About fifteen years later, when John has his established career and family, he has a close encounter with another dog.  He nearly ran over this dog with his car and it all comes back to him.  Once again, he can hear the animals, and he can talk back to them. `People really can talk to animals.'  This point is illustrated throughout the movie.  Whether as a child or a grown man, John Dolittle is capable of talking to animals.  Although he chose to suppress this talent for nearly fifteen years, it comes back full force.  With his talent, John is apprehensive at first.  He begins to think he is going crazy.  He even calls his doctor friend to examine him, but John is determined to make the best of it.  He begins helping the animals that come to him.  He can hear all sorts of animals barnyard animals, pets, and the wild animals of the forest. For example, John practically sacrifices his entire career to save a circus tiger. Throughout the movie there were many interesting and intriguing events 1) the tiger with the brain tumor and 2) the swan egg.  Once Dr. Dolittle started helping the animals, he was presented with a circus tiger suffering from a brain tumor.  In a crazy turn of events, Dr. Dolittle performs a life saving brain surgery that in turn allows the tiger to continue performing in the circus.  At the beginning of the movie, Dr. Dolittle's daughter finds an egg, thought to be a swan egg.  In a surprising twist, at the end of the movie it hatches and turns out to be a baby alligator.

One of my favourite scenes in comedy is in 'Fierce Creatures' starring John Cleese when Rollo Lee (John Cleese) tries his best to cope with the animals in the park yet at the same time attempting to keep a decorum. Such a formula could have been used in Dr Dolittle film to great effect.Directed by Betty Thomas, this film depicts a man who can talk to animals but not in the light seen in British - theatre.

With word of his ability spreading to all the animals, they start to show up at his doorstep wanting help with whatever problems they have, injury or social. His biggest challenge though comes in the form of a sick Tiger (Albert Brooks) who is trusting John to help heal his pain. Of course John is put into an institution when everyone thinks he is crazy, but he gets out and in the end proves his ability to save the Tiger's life.

It is absolutely plotless, feeling too flat. I also hate that irritating voice of Chris Rock!!! We need more talented voice-overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who don't want to declare bankruptcy. I'll have to agree on my local newspaper giving this among the top five worst movies of 1998. Then again, the original version wasn't any good, either. Murphy's next project could be PATTON if he's not careful!

There was no singing in Star Wars. So it will come as no surprise that I wasn't really anticipating this film and was prepared to be bored to tears with a G-rated Eddie Murphy singing to kids. Imagine my surprise to find some witty dialog coming right out of the horse's mouth so to speak. Ahem.Eddie Murphy plays Dr Dolittle a family man who seems a little wrapped in his work as a Doctor. So busy in fact that hasn't the time to stop and listen to the animals that all of a sudden decided that they would like to talk to him. Despite years of being silent. With in days Dolittle ditches the profitable people with Medical insurance in favor of pigeons and guinea pigs. His now talkative four legged and winged companions teach him how to be a better man, husband and father. Naturally a change of lifestyle and a better relationship with his family follows. All we need now is sort of dilemma and action in the 3rd act to seal the deal. Oh wait there it is save one Tiger from certain death. That was close nearly missed it in the moral preaching that saturates this film.The Animals are a host of well knowns that steal scene after scene with impersonations and one liners. Apparently animals make up for their lack of civility lack of technology opposable thumbs with a good sense of humor. Chris Rock as the hamster (also G-Rated) is completely wasted here however had my neighbors hamster made this much noise. It wouldn't have been set upon by the vacuum cleaner.The film is aimed at the children but there is enough here to keep the adults amused. Dr Dolittle has more that its share of slap stick and the toilet humor that cannot be avoided. Despite this its probably with the price of a rental.

It's a measure of the quality of humour in this script that Eddie  - though extremely funny - is matched and frequently eclipsed by the animals.  Some of the things they get up to (partly with the help of computer graphics, it must be said) are truly amazing.   Complaints?

It seems that he is becoming more of a virtual actor than a cutting edge actor like Wesley Snipes and Denzel Washington. As long as we don't have to see his face, or take him seriously in a feature film, then we can tolerate and accommodate his presence on the silver screen. The concept of having a black Dr. Dolittle is fresh and relevant to the 90's, and having animals made from the Creature Shop talking back to him not only echoes the relationship between Michael Jackson and Bubbles, but also gives the Creature Shop some kudos to engage with big named actors. Murphy by himself is not cutting edge, but by association with him he is able to stand the test of time.

He is so talented that offers of financial backing for he and his partners are coming in from unexpected sources. This is great news for John, his lovely wife and their two sweet daughters. However, when John was a boy, he could talk, truly, to his pet dog and spent time having long conversations with the canine. This made his father (Ossie Davis) so worried that he summoned the preacher to their house. There, the minister tried to call the devil out of John's body, an exercise that caused John's beloved dog to bite the holy man. When his father gave away the dog, John was heartbroken. No longer would he talk with animals. Yet, on a rainy night, Dr. John nearly hits a dog and brakes quickly, causing him to bump his head. Suddenly, John can hear what the animals around him are saying, much to his initial dismay. From rats to owls to tigers, animals are coming to ask for his help. With so much distraction, can he concentrate on his human medical treatments? This is a very nice family film, especially for those who adore animals. Murphy is great as the doctor and the rest of the cast is also nice, with Davis a pleasure to see and hear. Watch out, too, for Paul Giammati as the shrink summoned to examine John's mental health! The sets, costumes, and production are first rate. But, it is the lovable animals, and their human voices, that are the big stars. From the cute guinea pig to the lovable dog to the tipsy monkey, these critters are out to capture the hearts of the viewers. And, they succeed very, very well.

This is also a movie that is more marketed to children than adults and that is another problem with it.  It bogs down with a lot of sentimental rubbish as well...I don't know if it is just me, but I want to laugh when I go see a comedy, not have a message jammed down my throat.  Though this one is probably good for families, the parents should be warned that they are in for a good joke here or there, but the rest of the time it is a bit stupid.  Norm MacDonald is rather good as the voice of the dog and Chris Rock is recognizable as well, as for the rest of the voices who is to say who they are, no other actors with really distinct voices seem to be used.  Some of the jokes may be a bit inappropriate for children, but they most likely will go over the child's head.  For the most part this movie is a slow mover that just isn't all that funny for most adults.  Seems like Eddie though is making a career off of this type of movie so more power to him.

Kristen Wilson plays Murphy's wife Lisa, who puts in a fine performance, and a grown-up Raven-Symoné (who you'll remember as little Olivia in 'The Cosby Show') as Charisse and Kyla are both great in their roles.However, despite Eddie being at one of his funniest, it's definetely the animals that steal the show!
