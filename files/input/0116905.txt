While most scripts stumble recklessly from one hackneyed plot device to another, Lone Star flows like a steady, winding river, never letting the viewer see too far downstream. The spine of the film is Sherrif Sam Deed's investigation into a thirty-year-old murder, yet this story is quickly absorbed by many finely scripted subplots and an overall theme on the futility of trying to escape history.  While most directors can't help but show off when using flashy camera movement  and jumps in continuity, Sayles employs such a subtle directing style that his leaps in time and location are seamless.  Sayles fleshes out his script with subplots on racism, national pride, censorship, generation gaps, politics, social revisionism, and on and on.  Most directors don't tackle this many topics in a career, yet Sayles juggles them all in one film without jamming them down the audiences' throats.  If the subplots in Sayles' City of Hope were connected like a series of dominos, here they are gently woven together like a colorful, well-worn Southwestern quilt.  The love story between Chris Cooper and Elizabeth Pena is both wistful and steamy.  The film's social conscience is compelling.  The father/son conflict between Otis and Delmore Payne (Ron Canada and Joe Morton) feels totally realistic.  The dialoge is concise and insightful. Fate hangs over every character and every moment.  Plus Lone Star has one of my favorite final scenes, one that perfectly sums up the ironies of the film.  It is simply one of the best movies I have ever seen.

I haven't watched it in a few years now. Lone Star has, if anything, improved with each viewing, which is really saying something because I remember how truly riveted and fulfilled I was on its first viewing in the theater. This is film-making at its very best.This must be one of the all time greatest pieces of writing for the cinema. Period. So many characters are here and they're all richly developed and mined to make you think even more about the film's many themes. The story just hooks you right from the start and is utterly absorbing, and the layers of subplots and meanings reach dizzying heights of complexity and poignancy without sacrificing entertainment value. You practically walk away from the film saying yes, for once someone has something to say and it's said so eloquently. To me, Lone Star is one of the masterpieces of American movies.This has one of the greatest final lines that I've ever seen in a movie. That last line illuminates everything that has come before it in a way that is both shattering and ironic. The performances are uniformly superb, and you can just imagine what the cast was thinking, with the opportunity to perform this piece. All the technical aspects are first rate, which makes you truly wonder why movies cost so much in Hollywood. The music is outstanding. But at the end of the day, it's the incredible writing here that lingers. The second half of the movie pays off in spades due to the development of the many characters and sub plots that are so brilliantly interwoven. The movies Lone Star reminds me of most are The Last Picture Show, Chinatown, and Nashville. Take my word; if you like any of those pictures and haven't had the distinct pleasure of seeing Lone Star, please give it a chance. You will not be disappointed.

Sam has long lived in the shadow of his father Buddy, himself the sheriff at one time.  However clues point to the fact that the skull may belong to Charley Wade, the corrupt sheriff who `vanished' to Mexico when Deeds challenged him many years prior.  However when Sam begins to ask questions that go deeper than the legends, he finds secrets within the border town that hit very near home.Having just watched The Hi Lo Country (a modern day western with a sprawling story but focused on one thing), I was put in mind to watch Lone Star again.  Lone Star is easily the superior film and is a rich weaving of many characters and stories all around one event.  The one event is the uncovering of an old murder (possibly) and this central investigation holds the attention easily.  Within this investigation and the lives that Buddy affected we are shown a lot of subplots &#150; some followed through, others just giving us enough background to understand the characters.  All of these work very well and as a result you don't feel like the film is wandering when it moves away from the investigation by Sam.  The subplots are so well translated that we are given a lot of back story to complex characters in a very short time.For the script to be able to create so many characters that feel real and that have meaningful things going on is impressive.  That it makes them all work is amazing and is due to Sayles both writing and editing.  As director he is great as well, avoiding the washed out desert feel many `Mexico related' films have and instead goes for richer colours that reflect the rich mix of communities that are in his story.The acting is faultless all round.  No one actor stands out regardless of screen time simply because no one goes over the top and everyone realises they are playing part of a story &#150; even Cooper (realistically the nearest thing to a lead actor) plays it down rather than taking the film over.  Morton is good even if his character is the least connected to the investigation, McConaughey is strong despite being little more than a cameo, likewise with Kristofferson.  McDormand has a small role but is very impressive as Deeds' ex-wife.  Elizabeth Pe√±a, so often dumped with almost token Espanic roles is given a real good part and works with it well.  I could list them all, however if any one person stands out it can only be Sayles himself &#150; he takes all the strands and brings them together.  I watched a 90 minutes comedy earlier the same day that had dragged.  At 130 minutes this simply flew &#150; it is that engrossing.Overall some will find it too slow, too character driven, sadly some will just not sit through a good story if that's all there is to it (all!).  I think this was reflected in poor box office at the time (comparatively poor anyway).  But those who have seen it will generally love it &#150; if only more people would watch it!  A final word on the film &#150; the ending is shocking and sensationalist on paper and a lesser man would have made a big deal out of it.  Sayles simply ends the film softly and leaves us the audience to take what we will from it.  Low key from start to finish &#150; I can't praise it enough.

Like Godfather, this is a tale of families and how the sins of the fathers cast their shadows over the generations. To illustrate the connection, Sayles will slowly track his camera from a conversation in one part of a room to another part of the same room where characters who lived 25 years earlier are conversing. The years have passed, we realize, but all the characters, even the dead ones, are in this together. The technique may sound strange, but it works magically. And another thing I've always thought Kris Kristofferson was a better singer than actor, and a better songwriter than singer. But in this film he turns in an outstanding performance as a very very bad Texas border town sheriff who disappeared years ago and whose bones have just turned up in the desert. At least we think those are his bones, and to solve the puzzle, the current sheriff, son of the man who became sheriff when Kris disappeared, must dig further than he wants into the town's secrets. And once again, knowing how the film ends makes subsequent viewings just as fascinating as the first.

Out of the 30+ scripts I studied in script analysis classes, this was, other than Manhattan, the most interesting, involving, evocative screenplay I read during that period, and probably the one with the most depth. I saw the film a few months after reading its screenplay, and found that it far surpassed the mental image I had in my head of the film.Lone Star could have been a standard mystery. It could have been a 'modern Western', or it could have been a superficial race drama, but it is none of those things (at least not exclusively), it is a fascinating, subtle look at race relations in Texas, as well as at basic human nature. Unlike the contrived writing one would find in an 'Oscar bait' drama film, Sayles' interwoven plots don't feel forced simply because he sets them up so well. The depth and scale of the writing here is remarkable, especially because the film, with all its subplots and characters, never feels cluttered or unnatural. This is a character study of the highest order, and there's no point in discussing the actual events of the film further because this is a film that is best seen (or, indeed, read) with fresh eyes, and I'd hate to spoil that for readers who haven't seen the film.It's a sad fact of life that directors like Sayles, who see films as stories that must be told, and direct them well, but without intrusive and obvious stylistic quirks, are less noticed than directors who practically beg for attention. That's not to say that this film is not well-made, because anyone with any sort of experience with technical details of cinema could tell you that it is a very well-shot and very well-edited film with excellent use of music. That said, this film is ultimately about the writing, and the acting, and both are absolutely superb, the standout from the latter category being Chris Cooper, who gives what is probably one of the nineties' best performances in this film.10/10 "},{"Title":"My favourite film of all time.","Date":"11 September 1999","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  This is the only film I've ever seen for the first time, and then rewound and watched straight through again without even getting up for a cup of coffee. I don't even know where to begin in listing its qualities. Few films succeed in addressing such complex issues as race; our relationships with our parents; the nature of our attitudes to history; and the way the past shapes our lives in so subtle a manner as this. Somehow, John Sayles has managed to touch on all of these questions, without at any point being didactic, and to deal with them realistically and with respect to their complexity.Most amazingly of all, Sayles shows all sides of the various arguments running through the film and yet still manages to produce solutions, or at least the hope of solutions. That he is able to achieve this is a consequence of the humanity of his outlook. With the exception of Charlie Wade - the one straightforward character in the script - everybody in this film is complicated, realistic and, above all, sympathetic. The smallest cameo parts - the old lady playing a gameboy; the as liberal as the next guy bartender - are more interesting and plausible than the central characters in the majority of films.All this in a film which is not ostensibly character- or issue-driven. A film which instead features an involving mystery and an affecting romance, as well as numerous subplots (all beautifully paced and integrated), and in which almost everything proves to be connected.Great works of art shouldn't have to throw their message into the audience's faces. Instead, as the audience looks at their more superficial aspects of beauty or excitement, they should be drawn into their subtleties and more interesting depths. In Lone Star, everything - the arguments about race and the past, the tangible sense of a real community, the subversiveness of the film's ending - flows from what is at base simply a good story. This film is one of the outstanding achievements of 90s American cinema 10/10.

Self-financed on a small budget, using his large number of talented friends as cast and crew, Sayles crafts films that owe allegiances to no one but himself. Virtually never does he make the same film twice, and almost all of them are a great pleasure to watch.Lone Star is Sayles' masterpiece. It succeeds on every level as mystery, as romance, as social commentary. Set in a Texas border town, it creates a rich world peopled with characters and situations we understand and identify with.There is plot, mood, color, drama, passion, suspense and even humor, but if pressed to explain what it really is about, I would say that the theme is how the present is a product of the past, and how people are given opportunities to be imprisoned by it or to transcend it.Lone Star is one of only two American films of this decade (the other is Schindler's List) to which I would give a '10'.

True, he's made a couple which didn't quite work(BABY, IT'S YOU and EIGHT MEN OUT didn't work, at least for me), but he really is a talented filmmaker.  His films are almost always well-scripted, with the same care that goes into great novels(Sayles, of course, started out as a novelist).  Every film he makes really feels like it takes place somewhere, as opposed to just having a generic location.  His themes are often complex and interesting, and although he may come from a left-wing point of view, he doesn't paint one side as all good and one as all bad; he allows complexity and three dimensions to come in.  Finally, he's great with actors.LONE STAR ranks with my favorite of his work, along with RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN and CITY OF HOPE.  Like those films, this is an ensemble film, and like CITY OF HOPE, this is an intimate epic, a balancing act which is difficult to pull off.  He also really pays attention to history and how it affects all of us here, not just our personal history but our collective history.  It may take place in the context of a murder mystery(which was, admittedly, not hard to figure out), but that's just the starting point of Sayles' canvas.  Along with history, it's about family, what binds us together and what divides us, from father to son, mother to daughter, and sibling to sibling.  And finally, of course, it's about race, but again, not in the simplistic way of most Hollywood films.  What may seem like a cut-and-dried attitude, for example, by Buddy Deeds(Matthew McConaughey) towards his son Sam(played as an adult by Chris Cooper) and Pilar(played as an adult by Elizabeth Pena) going out together, is revealed to be something altogether different.Cooper brings to mind another Cooper, Gary, with his performance here.  As in MATEWAN, another Sayles film, he shows a complex set of emotions hidden behind what seems to be a simple man.  Elizabeth Pena, an underused actress, is quite good as Pilar, the schoolteacher caught between her present problems and her past love.  I've never been a fan of Kris Kristofferson, but he's quite menacing as Charlie Wade, the crooked sheriff whose past murder drives the present plot.  And Sayles regulars like Joe Morton and Stephen Mendillo put in memorable appearances as well.  A masterpiece.

Oh it's not that I feel real cool telling people to go find and see a great film that they've never heard of (although I must admit I do), but more that Mr. Sayles so often gets forgotten as one of the greatest writer/directors ever, and it's such a shame he doesn't get the notoriety he deserves for making such great films. He often uses many of the same actors in his movies, but then again, why shouldn't he...they're always terrific (and by the way, why don't THEY get more notoriety, too?) After all these years, Chris Cooper is finally becoming well known as an excellent actor (and is getting more roles as a result), and as usual, he's tremendous here in playing the lead role. In fact, I've never liked Kris Kristofferson, but he is SUPERB in this film, and I cannot possibly imagine anyone playing the role of Charlie Wade any better. You can get the plot line of this movie from many of the other IMDb comments, but it's not simply the intriguing plot of this movie that makes it so great. It's the way the film is woven and the atmosphere that is created throughout (a John Sayles specialty.) Granted, it IS a character study with general societal overtones, so it may appear slow in comparison to big budget special effects action movies, or kick-in-the-groin comedies (our unfortunate obsessions), but if you stick with it for just a bit, you'll find the beautifully crafted tapestry unfolding through the characters with riveting intrigue. It's really a pleasure to watch a film take bits and pieces of many different stories (and with flashbacks mixed in as well) and slowly but surely lead you to the edge of your seat as it ties all the different subplots together until you gradually begin to realize what a GREAT film you're watching and you can't wait to see how it's going to turn out in the end. One of the exceptional things about this film is that just when you thought the ending was quite good, and you got to find out the truth, it turns out that the FINAL closing scene is the REAL payoff, and it's even BETTER than what you THOUGHT would be the ending. I've been telling others to see this outstanding, exceptional film for about 10 years now, and will continue to do so at every opportunity.

I'd rank it with Shawshank Redemption as one of the best films made in the 1990s.  The script is filled with social issues all flawlessly interconnected. The story lines are linked together around a border town sheriff's investigation of a 40-year-old murder that may have been committed by his own father.  There is also a touching romance at the center of the story. But the story touches on racism, interracial relationships, multicultural education, drug use, criminal justice, difficulties between generations, political and police corruption, mental illness, divorce, and illegal immigration.Sayles is a great director and this is his best work.  I also recommend Men with Guns and Limbo which are both outstanding although I'd put them slightly below Lone Star.The movie is about history and our connections to it.  Its also about how boundaries and borders between nations and races are really meaningless and artificial.  That is the real theme of the movie and it is presented in numerous fascinating metaphors.  The direction and screenwriting is fabulous and the characters seem natural and normal.  This is clearly a tribute to Sayles's skills since he also wrote the script.  Some of the lines are hilariously unforgettable in the natural way that people really talk. Chris Cooper is terrific as the sheriff.  Even Matt McConaughey is believable in flashback scenes as sheriff's late father.  Kris Kristofferson, Elizabeth Pena, and rest of the cast are flawless.  Look for Frances McDormand late in the movie in a hilarious cameo as the sheriff's ex-wife.It is a real shame that this film was nominated for only one Academy Award in screen writing.

Here they emerge as quirky, robust characters in themselves. The problem of the murder, which Cooper is discouraged from looking into, recedes into the background.Mostly this is Sayles' look at three sub-cultures red-necked, savvy Texas rustics, the flourishing and ambitious Mexican community, and the more marginalized African-Americans who run the roadhouse on the outskirts of town and who have populated the local army base.Sayles has used this tripartite structure before, most notably in Matewan. The intent of the earlier film was more didactic and its execution more obvious. We all have to pull together to achieve a common goal. (Cf., Muzafer Sheriff's Robber's Cave experiment.) In Lone Star the important conflicts have more to do with family relations and love affairs, including interracial ones.Elizabeth Pena plays Cooper's simmering long-time love. Whew. She's slender without being shapely. Her features are large and not pretty by Hollywood standards. But she's a magnetic figure on screen. She moves languidly and her speech kind of slouches around its phones, the words melting slowly into one another. I grew up near the New Jersey neighborhood in which she lived and it was a quiet Cuban settlement where you could find a cup of espresso coffee for a nickel. It was hardly elegant but it was safe and tolerant, even welcoming. She's a little like that.Her exact opposite is Frances MacDormand, Cooper's ex, who is obsessed by football and other sports and describes herself (in a short scene) as wound up, but any shrink is more likely to recognize her as a mild bipolar in a manic phase, full of speech pressure, poor judgment, and irritability. (Had any more of your fires lately?, asks Cooper gently, inquiring about some goods he left behind when he moved out.) There's a neat exchange between the two of them. I guess you didn't know I was tightly wound when we got together, she says to him as he's leaving. It wasn't only you, Bunny, he replies. I know, she says with some of her irritation returning. That's pretty good writing. It avoid turning her into nothing more than a flake and it points up Cooper's own imperfections and the certain insight that two intelligent people have into a now-extinct love relationship.I may run out of space here, and we don't want any red flags, so let me just say that this is a movie with a measured and deliberate pace, more interested in people than plot, and that it's superbly acted by all of the principals.

The editing in this film is seamless and yet complex, switching from one era to another, one lighting to another with intelligent punctuation in cinematography (for example tortillas covering banknotes) adding to the entertainment.Sayles must be aware that he has achieved better milestones in direction than in Lone Star. Limbo has a philosophical depth and maturity that overshadows the more earthy realities that lend color to Lone Star. While individual performances in Lone Star cry out for recognition, the performances of the lead actors in Limbo are low key but nonetheless fascinating.Sayles won plaudits for the screenplay and he deserved it. The social complexities that the screenplay presents interweaving three races and three families grabs the attention of the American social quilt. It's real and immediate. In Limbo, the screenplay reaches out beyond America; it's more universal in appeal. The end scene of Lone star seems to have been the inspiration for the last shot of Monster's Ball. While Lone Star will be remembered for individual personalities, Sayles' Limbo will be remembered for its brilliant philosophical, open-ended closing shot.

And there is no doubt that this is one of the greatest payoffs that comes from reading, writing, discussing, and studying work from lots of different disciplines.  This is also one of the greatest payoffs of John Sayles' superb film, Lone Star.  It is a story with a non-linear, winding plot, a vast array of characters, and it takes a little patience to watch. But it is also richly rewarding because Sayles' vision brings together people from different backgrounds in the most surprising and illuminating ways.  Characters that seem closed-minded and foolish end up being very human by the end of this film.  It's almost as if Sayles can't help but write complex characters, even when they have a small role to play in the overall plot.  This film masterfully explodes the notion that there's just one perspective, one story.  Multiple perspectives, multiple views of one incident are the meat of Lone Star.I would also add that the way Sayles writes male characters is very special. If Raging Bull is the ultimate in what is ugly and heart wrenching about masculinity, then John Sayles' many male characters throughout his films are the equivalent of what is decent, enduring, and worthy about men in America. Chris Cooper's character in Lone Star is someone that young men should watch and try to emulate.  It takes a lot more strength to be decent and gentle like this than it does to be cruel and macho.Simply put, I can't recommend Lone Star enough.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're in for a treat.

Every character so interesting, even when shown but briefly -- could make ten or twelve great films from characters like these. And that's just what this film is -- ten or twelve levels of magnitude above even most good films. I've seen it three times, maybe four. Saw it twice at the theater in one week, when it first came out. Then watched with friends on their home dish, then rented the video. Still can't get enough of it. Should rate up there with Treasure of the Sierra Madre or Kurosawa's Roshoman. Compares well, oddly enough, with Truffaut's Day for Night... although a very different type of story. Sad in tone, a little like Hitchcock's Marnie, but Lone Star is more hopeful, more optimistic, all the more surprisingly so because of how it gazes unflinchingly at and exposes many evils. Quite a few other great films come to mind, but Sayles' Lone Star is uniquely its vision, its own style. Maybe it was overlooked because people thought it was just a detective story; just a Western. Maybe the young crowd wanted more of young Chris, not old Kris. Elizabeth Pena didn't time her appearance to coincide with Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and the rest of the Latin Explosion which arrived a few years later. Unfortunate. Well, maybe its time for a revival. She's outstanding here; but so many performances shine.

When Ellizabeth Pena spoke her memorable closing line when I went to see it at the theater here in Austin, the audience erupted in applause.The film is set in the fictional equivalent of Eagle Pass, on the Rio Grande, which thus contributes to the plot both Anglos and Hispanics. (Eagle Pass is a location also in Like Water for Chocolate.) Add to the mix a U.S. army base, incorporating African-Americans, and the brew isn't complete even there. A discussion among local teachers about how best to teach the state's history sets up the rich portion of the plot which revolves around issues of ethnicity, while simultaneously (cleverly) misdirecting the viewer's expectations about one of the movie's major mysteries.It is amazing that John Sayles can come in from outside and understand this region so well. An exemplary instance is when Frances McDormand's character is raving about a high school football player from...and the script fills in (if I recall correctly)...San Antonio Churchill. It's a perfect choice, in a way that nowhere else except maybe Converse Judson or Gregory-Portland or Refugio would have achieved. Permian (Odessa Permian) would have been too obvious. Austin McCallum, or some such, would have left gridiron-fan moviegoers wrinkling their noses at the faux pas. In short, Sayles, who was writer as well as director, superbly did his homework.Pena, McDormand, Chris Cooper, Matthew McConaughey, Kris Kristofferson, Joe Morton, and Clifton James are all great. Miriam Colon (in INGLIS, Enrique) and Ron Canada stand out. Tony Plana, as a deputy who is contemplated by the minority community as an electoral challenger to Cooper the incumbent sheriff, delivers the movie's most comical non-McDormand line.

Time and time again he crafts works that are both commercial and intellectually interesting. Lone Star would stand on its own as film about a 40 year-old murder mystery, but we see so much more in typical Sayle's style; well written dialog, impeccable casting and even-paced story telling.Rio County, where Lone Star is set, is a microcosm of the U.S.; minorities becoming the majority and a town and its inhabitants coming to terms with past prejudices and deeply held secrets. The lead character, Sheriff Sam Deeds, seeks to reconcile the reverence with which the town holds his late father and predecessor, Buddy Deeds, with the man he knew as a distant and sometimes cruel father. When the 40 year-old remains of his father's immediate predecessor are discovered, Deeds retraces the lives and secrets and papered-over injustices of Rio. The murder is only one more sin that has come unexpectedly back to the surface.Rio's Mexican and black residents have suffered under the weight of Rio's history, and some prefer to leave the past buried. Truth is less important than distance from the pain. Sam Deeds looks at his father's legacy and sees compromise, corruption and selective justice. The younger Deeds came back to Rio not to continue his father's legacy but to come to terms with an identity he walked away from years before.Deeds ultimately solves the murder mystery, an outcome that is unsatisfactory (he wants to expose his father as a severely corrupt and phony hero) in some ways, but delivers to him a perspective on his town, his life and his father that brings a different type of closure. Justice is not always perfect or transparent.

Choosing a specific genre for this film to fall into was quite tricky for both producers and film critics, but I would label this film a modern melodrama. Although, Sayles does an excellent job in narrating the complex plot and surprise ending by delivering information in small timely digestible doses, making the film much more real and simply dramatic, I would still consider this film closer to the realm of modern melodrama mainly because of the incestuous surprise ending. The film's popularity has recently increased in the past couple of years seeing that it did not do so well in the box office, this would explain why this film was definitely ahead of the times. Reflections and Reactions One of the most interesting aspects of this film involved Sayles' use of narrative style. The traditional narrative style is deconstructed through the use of intricate flash backs, characters discussion of conflicting views of History, and the use of tangible historical artifacts in order to provide a much needed connection to the past. Through this narrative style Sayles was able to touch on just about every controversial political topic thinkable for the community in the small border town. It seems that the main argument for each of the different political subjects was based on the idea of history and who ever controls that history. One strong example involves Pilar Cruz (the school teacher) trying to explain why she taught the history of the Alamo the way that she did, as disgruntled parents insist that she 'just teach what's in the books'. Pilar Cruz who is half Mexican and half White obviously has trouble swallowing the Alamo history which the state of Texas has issued her and simply wants to give a different account or viewpoint on the matter, but it is blasphemy to do so because she would be stepping out of her bounds, her element. In this town one can see that the rich, successful, and political office holding citizens are all white with the exception of one Mexican American woman, Mercedez Cruz, who has become not only a successful business owner but also a racist self hating Mexican. This theme of controlling whiteness represents an invisible institutionalized racism which has manifested itself into simply controlling the wealth, as well as history, which is why so many parents were outraged by Pilar Cruz's teaching approach because losing the control of what is taught to their children is like losing the Alamo all over again. This example of Sayles' use of history through narrative was just one small subplot from the film, which is why the film was praised by all serious film critics  "},{"Title":"Life Cut Short","Date":"19 May 2004","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  John Sayles' Lone Star is, above all else, a film about the past, personal and historical, and its impact on the citizens of a small Texas town. The opening of the film sets up the theme quite nicely - we can imagine what kind of past Sayles is exploring here when two bullet collectors discover the skeleton of a corrupt sheriff. Surely, it's not a past of flowers and rainbows, but a dark and sordid one, full of conflict, greed and power struggles. Thus it comes as a surprise that a film about people who attempt to uncover the mystery and deal with the findings ends so neatly. In doing so Lone Star misses greatness, but it is hardly a bad film.That's because Sayles understands the interaction between temporal ecstasies rather well. The past affects the present and vice-versa. He shows us that we derive our identity from the past, our sense of belonging and of community. We see this illustrated through the mosaic of stories, a form of narrative brought to its perfection in Magnolia or 13 Conversations About One Thing. There is the sheriff played superbly by the pre-American Beauty Chris Cooper who gets drawn into the mystery out of duty and because of his father, in whose shadow he lives. There is his former love interest, a Mexican teacher who attempts to justify teaching a more complex version of Texan history to the kids, only to be countered by the white minority of Rio County. And we have Colonel Delmore Payne played by Terminator-2-black-guy-who-dies-to-save-the-future Joe Morton whose misconception of the past prevents a relationship with his father.The past affects the way these characters perceive themselves, others and it steers the choices they make. However Sayles' film would be incomplete if it settled for a one-sided relationship between the past and the present. Sayles is aware of this. The present, after all, also impacts they way the characters perceive the past. Cooper's Sheriff Sam Deeds is influenced by the image of his father in his investigation. The white parents of school kids carry certain biases which prevent them from understanding the complexity of the past.These interactions are fascinating when they are unraveling. Relationships build, racial and generational conflicts emerge, perceptions change and choices are made. All this occurs against a large temporal backdrop, but it comes to a far too conclusive end. While you're watching Lone Star, the atmosphere comes alive, but by its conclusion, it becomes clear that it's a neatly dissected tale about intersecting stories that were designed to come together. The film detaches itself from the viewer and says all that was supposed to happen happened exactly as planned - you may go. The problem, of course, is that the issues presented by the film should not be entirely resolved. Yes, the mystery of the skeleton, which really occurs in the background (though it drives the story), should arguably be explained. But the rest - it seems like Sayles put a lot of effort into characters that aren't allowed to argue, conflict and interact after the credits.Still, that's just me quibbling because I really wanted more. The truth of the matter is that Lone Star is a remarkably structured and directed film. It's got phenomenal performances by Chris Cooper (who always stars in *almost* great films - e.g. Adaptation or American Beauty), Kris Kristofferson as the skeleton before he becomes one and Matthew McConaughey (whom I generally don't like) as Cooper's father. Lone Star is worth seeing because it has the makings of a great film. It just isn't one.

My brother is an extra in the film. He's in the classroom scene, and he's sitting behind the Army officer's kid. My brother is wearing a blue, button-down shirt....he borrowed it from my dad. What's funny about this is that the entire classroom is filled with people from Eagle Pass, people I know personally. Anyway, the girls who are sitting at the front of the classroom sat there because they thought, if they took a place at the front of the classroom, they'd get maximum exposure. Well, they didn't. My brother, Derek, who really didn't care about exposure time, sat wherever there was an empty seat, and that spot is where the camera was focused. Also, the police station, was filmed at the Eagle Pass City Hall building. The lake scenes were actually filmed in Del Rio, Texas, which is Eagle Pass's sister sister located less than an hour away. There is one scene where Chris Cooper goes into Mexico, and we follow his car going into Mexico, then another shot follows his car going in the opposite direction. The scene is supposed to relay Cooper's travels into Mexico, but these two shots are actually just two shots of the same car going one way, then the same car going down the same street IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. Pierdras Negras, Mexico is infamous for having only one-way streets, and if you watch carefully, you will see the same motel sign coming and going. The movie was filmed during the early spring....I know because Eagle Pass is HOTTER THAN HELL any other time of the year.Big O's place was actually a building that already existed. It was a dive bar, a hole in the wall, a place where even if you were so Jone's'n for a drink, you'd have to think twice about stepping foot in that place because it was so stank. After the film closed, the sign out front remained, but soon it was changed to something else....a strip bar. It remained open for a while, but then closed, and I'm not sure why.

The result is a story that contains its own philosophy about storytelling. Part of this is too obvious to mention memories built around deeds and following laws of nature. Communities defining themselves in terms of constructed myths, myths which provide the skeletons for recall. New entrants in the community redefining themselves to internalize the myths. Some of this is wonderfully subtle note how Sayles folds time by simple pans. Some of this is just attention to the writing mirrors of fatherhood -- a men discovering their boys, sons discovering their fathers. History as tradition in the military, in the community, in the family. The barriers emplaced to prevent wandering from the strictures of concretized memory.

Additionally, two of the principal characters are already dead and seen only in flashback scenes. I can't recall this device employed in any prior films I've seen, and this adds to the complexity of the story's non-linear narrative.Above all perhaps is the sophisticated writing and direction of John Sayles, who handles the topics of racism and incest in a straightforward but non judgmental manner. I have to say, the ending left me conflicted about the direction the relationship between Sam and Pilar might take. As offspring of the same father, I would have expected there to be a lot more turmoil and conflicted feelings between the two after Sam explains everything he learned about his father's past. The dialog between the characters allows the viewer to reach their own conclusion about where they go from here, though to me it seems they were open to making things work out for themselves.The thing that really jolted me in this story was the person of Sheriff Charlie Wade as portrayed by Kris Kristofferson. I've never seen Kristofferson reach so low in the gutter before to create a character like the former sheriff. He was just vile with no regard for normal decency or human kindness. What happened to Charlie Wade was the lesser of two significant twists in the story. Having set up the viewer to expect that he was killed by former deputy Buddy Deeds (Matthew McConaughey), Sayles once again stuns the viewer with the circumstances of Wade's death.

This brings the mystery of the sudden, unexplained disappearance 40 years earlier of the town's bullying, psychopath Sheriff, Charlie Wade (played with great menace by Kris Kristofferson - there was a collective intake of breath amongst the cinema audience every time he came on screen when I first saw the film here in London in 1996!), back to the fore amongst the older residents of Frontera.Chiefly concerned is the current Sheriff, Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper) whose father (& long-term predecessor as Sheriff) Buddy had long been suspected of murdering Wade. The twists and turns of the plot as Sam talks to people who had known his two predecessors in the town & across the border in Mexico are gradually skilfully tied together. During these few days, Sam also re-kindles his romance with his high school sweetheart Pilar (played with understated elegance by Elizabeth Pena), which Buddy had forcibly ended 23 years earlier.Mr Sayles also uses a tracking technique several times in the film to great effect by switching from events happening now to those taking place in the past, using exactly the same locations.A couple of slight carps - the character of young Hollis (Buddy Deeds' co Deputy Sheriff to Charlie Wade 40 years earlier) is very under-developed, so he unfortunately comes across as a complete nonentity, & the two characters of Wesley Birdsong (Gordon Tootoosis) & Bunny, Sam's tightly wound ex-wife (an electrifying 5 minute performance by Frances McDormand) each appear out of the blue 3/4 of the way through the film with very little connection to the action up to that point - but, between them, manage to provide the final clues to enable Sam to solve the murder mystery!These are very minor criticisms in what is a beautifully shot & acted, enthralling murder mystery, which also shows how people of different cultures manage to co-exist astride the US - Mexico border.

Lone star is a good drama about conflict between a child and it's parent , which appears here three times (Sam , Pilar and Delmore Payne &#x96; they all in conflict with one of their parents). The movie also quite well portrays the tension between the citizens of the city &#x96; white , black , Latin . The portrayal here seems very realistic and doesn't take any sides. It's fair look at the serious problem and allows you to make your own opinion.The acting is solid , especially Kris Kristofferson as the evil sheriff. The characters are likable. The screenplay has it's share of good humor and some nice twists near the end.The movie with a better direction and 30 minutes shorter (some subplots don't seem that necessary) could be a really great one. Still , it's a good movie. I give it 7/10.

The characters may be slow-moving and tight-lipped out of habit, but the ambiguity of their feelings is plain, and a strength of this drama, as is the way the plot weaves in many aspects of life in a border town. Perhaps some aspects of the way that town life is portrayed are a little too stylised, a little anachronistic, the reality of Mexican-American relations shown through the lens of the traditional western but but film stays consistently within the world it has created. In terms of overall mood, there are elements that resemble the later 'No Country For Old Men', but without that movie's fall-back psychopath-driven plot, it offers a more interesting and ultimately humane vision of south Texas life.

It's also, I felt, a little too long; the filmmakers are asking quite a lot for an audience to concentrate for two hours and fifteen minutes. It is slow paced, but I didn't particularly mind that; I'm used to the noir style and it is usually quite a slow burner. Some great performances with Chris Cooper coping well with the leading role and Kris Kristofferson playing the villain of the peace with gusto. Also we have Elizabeth Pe√±a, who did an excellent job as the female lead and a small part for Matthew McConaughey as Buddy Deeds.

It has to do with the simple fact that this movie keeps switching back and forth between present time and the past. With the use of flashback it slowly starts to become more apparent what happened 40-years before a skeleton got dug up, somewhere in the Texas desert. Lots of different story lines and characters end up getting intertwined but luckily the movie never becomes a messy or confusing one.It's actually a nice thing the movie has so many different characters in it, with each their own thing happening. It makes the movie, that otherwise probably would had been kind of slow, one that has always something happening in it and never becomes dull or a drag. You could actually say that the movie thrives on its characters. Everything that is happening and going on in this movie is due to them. They makes things interesting, as basically all of them need to come on terms with themselves and their past. This really ain't no ordinary murder mystery but more of a character-piece instead!And the movie of course has a great cast for that. The movie is well cast, especially when considering that most of the actors who appear in this movie weren't being big stars yet at the time. This for instance goes for Chris Cooper and Matthew McConaughey. All of the actors did a great job in this movie and were given plenty of opportunity to shine in this one.The movie at first truly feels like a Coen-brothers movie and it maintains this sort of feeling and style pretty much throughout the entire movie but it's being a bit more drama than comedy orientated. I actually do believe that if the Coen-brothers directed this movie it would had been a far better known was, as well as a better one I feel. The movie could had used some humor and entertainment in at times, since the right type of story and characters were definitely there for it.But oh well, the movie was going for a different approach and it still is for most part being successful with it as well. It simply great, little and simple movie to watch and there is also no good reason why you shouldn't!8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"It's not like there's a line between the good people and the bad people. It is not like you're one or the other.","Date":"1 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" Lone Star is written and directed by John Sayles. It stars Chris Cooper, Joe Morton, Stephen J. Lang, Stephen Mendillo, Elizabeth Pe√±a and Kris Kristofferson. Music is scored by Mason Daring and cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh.The small Texas town of Rio County is rocked when a human skeleton is found in the sand and a Rio County Sheriff's badge found near by. The evidence points to it being the body of one time Sheriff Charlie Wade, a vile man who bullied the town for gratification and who one day just disappeared. Current Sheriff Sam Deeds begins investigating, knowing full well that there's a good chance the murderer could have be his own father, Buddy, who was known to have stood up to Wade with some hostile conviction.A hugely enjoyable pulpy mystery that's given a cunning make over by the talented Sayles. The who done it question at the film's core is merely one ingredient in this particular stew, this deals in themes such as violence, racism and family strife, the impact of lawmen on one small town, spread out across two generations. All the characters are interesting and well delineated, the dialogue as part of a non-linear narrative is precise and telling, while Sayles proves to be a stylistic craftsman by presenting two scenes 40 years apart within the same shot. A morality tale of some substance, with cast performances to match, it's a film sure to reward more with each viewing. 8/10 "},{"Title":"This Stretch Of Road Runs Between Nowhere And Not Much Else","Date":"28 April 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" Sam Deeds is the son of a late but much beloved Texas county sheriff who has inherited his father's job. But when a body is dug up from forty years ago and Sam investigates he discovers his father's illustrious past contains some dark and painful secrets ...This Texican murder mystery is one of Sayles' many beautifully constructed and densely populated character dramas (see also City Of Hope and Sunshine State) where, as with so much of his work, every single person is interesting, thoughtful and fully-rounded. This film is also a beautiful example of how to elegantly switch a narrative back and forward through two different eras, both visually through lovely little panning shots which dip in and out of time, and plot-wise as gradually the gauze covering the complex relationships is slowly lifted to reveal what has made the characters who they are. This is immensely satisfying as the pieces fit together, delicately played by a sensational ensemble cast who understand exactly what the story is trying to achieve. Cooper and Pe√±a are both superb as the middle-aged leads, both working county jobs, both struggling to find any meaning to their lives, both unable to move on from a fateful past together. The older actors steal the show with irascible wit, and pragmatism and regret written in equal measure on their faces - Canada in particular is outstanding - and Morton is terrific as ever in one of many parts for Sayles as the no-nonsense army man forced to embrace the tenderness he has long considered a weakness. Perhaps the casting masterstroke though is country legend Kristofferson as the thoroughly evil ghost from the past, whose violent brand of personal justice is horrifyingly plausible. Full of poignant moments, clever misdirection, evocative locations, heartfelt performances and funny lines (when Sam is headed to Mexico and tells a colleague he's going to the other side, the response is Republicans ?), with a fine story and a great ending, this is high quality drama all the way. Shot in the beautiful south-western Texas border cities of Del Rio, Eagle Pass and Laredo.

The pacing is quite superb, unfolding like a great novel and keeps one quietly riveted for all of its two & a quarter hours. The characters are all so well rounded, their persona's so completely but subtly explored that one lives in and breathes every scene.Watching again on BBC2, after several year's gap, it still smacks of being totally relevant and up to date. Wrapped up within its celluloid binding is a tale of every family nuance, racial bigotry and human thought and emotion that a Chekov might. The soundtrack, too, is wonderfully eclectic and fitting.The plot is involved, but easy to follow, and never patronising in its assumptions.

This movie has a most unusual depth and diversity of characters and cultures that spans many generations (at times back into 19th century history), the only film I can think of that comes close is Gone with the Wind. The crime scene investigation is only the outermost layer of the onion. It is a metaphor for one man's quest for Truth in a deeply flawed human world that strongly prefers myths. The movie is an exploration of the inexorable individual, generational, cultural, and racial baggage that haunts our mortal existence. It is about the human connections that transcend imagined and ever-changing boundaries. The school PTA meeting scene is not an irrelevant tangent. It is an encapsulation of this central underlying theme. When the white man dances with the Hispanic woman in a Mexican restaurant in Texas to an Ivory Joe Hunter rhythm and blues song sung in Spanish by Freddy Fender you should get the picture! This film is a rich tapestry that can fairly be called Shakesperian. In classic form, the multiple layers of mythologies are slowly revealed to be solace from the boundless tragedy of human truths. This is a must see film about the threads of humanity that link (and separate) us all across many generations. Strongly recommended. Don't miss it.

The only way to have rendered this split attitude correctly would have been to stage the scene in a de-psychologised, mocking Brechtian manner, with the actor directly addressing the public 'I, the commander of the concentration camp, find this girl sexually attractive, however, I am also impregnated by the racist ideology which tells me that Jews are filthy and unworthy of my attention. So I do not know how to decide.' &#x96; Slavoj Zizek (on Schindler's List) Regarded by many as the director's best film, John Sayles' Lone Star takes place in a Texan border town. Here a cast of Mexicans, Texans and African Americans mull over the usual John Sayles topics ethnic tensions, cultural assimilation, politics, education, capitalism, forced excavation and even ethnic cleansing. And as usual with Sayles, this multi-ethnic, multi-class, multi-generation tale is told via an ensemble cast, subplots criss-crossing and co-mingling until the film's message coalesces.Until its climax, Lone Star is fairly riveting, not only a superior version of race-relation movies like Grand Canyon and Paul Haggiss' Crash, but a tense Southern Noir, with that genre's usual assortment of showdowns, criminal investigations and murder mysteries. When the film reveals its point, however, you realise how small an artist Sayles is. He's a far-left Stanley Kramer, a maker of middlebrow message moves which often chew on Big Issues in the most obvious, condescending ways imaginable.The plot the always excellent Chris Cooper plays a Texan Sheriff who symbolically puts his long dead father on trial. Did daddy, the film asks, commit a murder many years ago? Did the murdered man, a symbolic totem of America's racist past, deserve to die? Was Daddy himself racist? Why did Daddy prevent the young Cooper from striking up a relationship with a Mexican girl? By the film's end, Sayles has dredged up the past and used interracial sex as a cynosure for racial harmony and racial equality. If whites, blacks, Indians and Mexicans can have some good ole interracial sex, and produce some smiley-toothed mixed race kids, everything will be all right. This is a common trope in cinema. Be it Avatar, Monster's Ball, Dances With Wolves, Sayonara, Heaven and Earth, Passage To India, The Searchers, A Man Called Horse etc etc, interracial sex is always used as a clunky metaphor for the soothing of racial tensions, the white man humping Mexicans, giant blue aliens, native American Indians, and Africans as a form of racial therapy. This is miscegenation and clitoral stimulation as affirmative action, the implication being that the Other can only be made whole again if the white man takes her in, accepts her, as a sexual object, object of beauty, or in a benevolent, paternalistic way. In other words, unless chosen for sex, unless deemed physically attractive by your suitor, you remain debased, an animal beneath compatibility with true Homo Sapiens.In many ways, Lone Star is a glorified version of the cellar scene in Schindler's List, in which ideology is understood as a literal moment of psychological doubt between attraction and hatred. Ie &#x96; my country tells me to hate Africans/Blue-Aliens/Jews/Indians, but my eyes tell me they are sexy; which is right? Of course you never see these films from the perspective of the woman. It is always the male symbolically inducting, from a position of authority, the foreign subject into the realm of Western norms of sex, civilisation and sexuality. And such narratives always posit sex as being evidence against primitivism, rather than itself being a product of a primal desire for ownership, domination, even a desire to be desired. A better question is whether ideology can really be undermined by giving way to sexual desire or permissiveness. In some ways yes, in most ways no; things are much too complex.Lone Star works well when it's sticking to pulpy, genre conventions, Sayles serving up a nice little Western/noir/drama hybrid; along these lines its brilliant. Unfortunately the film's dialogue is comprised mostly of lectures, on the nose preaching and spoon-feeding. Sayles is always explaining himself. Of the cast, Sayles regulars Kris Kristofferson and Chris Cooper shine. They have wonderful faces, and know how to chew scenery without speaking.7.9/10 &#x96; Though excellent, underrated, well-meaning and much more visually confident than Sayles other films, this ultimately becomes a very middle-brow message movie. Worth two viewings.

Much of the movie is told in flashback by director John Sayles, with the camera panning from a present day scene to the location of some event in the Fifties where we see it replayed, then panning back to the present characters, lost in recollection of those days gone by. It works very well, without having to have title cards telling us when we've moved in time.The story takes place in a sleepy hick town in Texas on the Mexican border, near a US Army base. In this town, everyone has a past. Even the sheriffs. Sam has gone through a divorce, and we get to see him with his ex-wife, Bunny (Frances McDormand). It's a heart-tugging scene, as it becomes clear Bunny will never be the son her father wanted.Sam moves back home to see his high school flame, Pilar (Elizabeth Pena). However, his father's friends press him to run for sheriff because the name Buddy Deeds still carries weight, and the current sheriff isn't popular. Sam wins, but it's no victory for him. Sheriff Buddy Deeds took over the job when Sheriff Charlie Wade (played with great menace by Kris Kristofferson), a corrupt, racist man, simply disappeared, never to be heard from again. Since Wade was hated by all the blacks and browns in town, it was a toss up who did him in, and sleeping dogs were let lie.But Sleep ... knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care, and Sam keeps getting clues across his sheriff's desk that he can't ignore. Clues about who murdered Wade; unfortunately, the clues point all over the place -- to the African American bar owner who ran numbers in the backroom, a Mexican who ran wetbacks across the Rio Grande in the back of his truck, and it takes some quiet patience to knit up the unraveled threads that go back about forty years.Sam renews his acquaintance with Pilar, and we meet her mother and learn her mother's past. The African American bar owner has a past, too, and it's bound up with the current base commander (Joe Morton, lately in the TV series Eureka). Sam patiently knits the clues into a fabric that tells the story, and we find that everyone's past is intertwined. As Sam pulls it all together, he discovers more than he bargained for. Much more.Although there is violence in the movie, it takes a back seat to the development of character. We watch Sam shed his old skin, accept his divorce, and move on. Elizabeth Pena is very good, giving us novels with a brief pause in her walk when she sees Sam again. It's a movie for patient people, and the patience is rewarded with an ending that is moving.John Sayles directed The Brother from Another Planet, a completely off beat picture totally unlike Lone Star except that it stars Joe Morton. And Chris Cooper played Colonel Frank Fits, a character totally unlike Sam, in American Beauty. And Frances McDormand - I haven't seen her in a film I didn't like Blood Simple, Fargo, Burn After Reading.

The rich colors, the semi-arid desert landscape, the music, the vocal twang, the food, the clothes, etc., all look, sound, and feel legit, a tribute to the film's casting, production design, costumes, acting, dialogue, soundtrack, and cinematography. The only problem is that Blacks are not nearly as numerous as Lone Star would lead one to believe.I wish I could viva el cuento, but I can't. The story here combines sordid personal relationships in a small, fictional border town, with a forty year old murder, all told in periodic flashbacks. The plot is unnecessarily complex. It rambles and it meanders. The film's too many, and not well defined, characters come and go in a haphazard way. And that results in a jumble of loosely related and, at times, confusing subplots.Lone Star reminds me of a much older film, one from 1971, about life in a small Texas town. The Last Picture Show contained all the realism of rural Texas in the early 50s. But, in addition, it told a straightforward story; it had well defined characters; and it effectively blended humor into the poignant drama.I enjoyed the Tex-Mex atmosphere of Lone Star. But when I want to watch a Texas film with a satisfying story, I will be more inclined to watch The Last Picture Show.

Nor is that its only distinction. Sam Deeds, the reluctant sheriff of fictional Rio County, TX, investigates a 40-year-old mystery when a human skeleton turns up in the desert.  The body is identified as Charlie Wade, thug, murderer, racist goon -- and former sheriff, missing since 1957 or so.  The investigation seems to cast suspicion on Buddy Deeds, Wade's successor, who became a local hero of legendary status -- to everyone except his son Sam.  The resolution of the mystery reminds one of the conclusion of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.En route to that resolution, the movie takes an unhurried and unsentimental look at the dynamics and tensions of race -- white, Mexican, black, and Indian -- in a waning border town. A fine cast helps Chris Cooper is Sam Deeds; Elizabeth Pena is his main squeeze and then some; and Frances McDormand is memorable in a one-scene role as Sam's ex-wife Bunny, an avid Dallas Cowboys fan accurately described as highly-strung.

But it's about America in the dusk of the twentieth century. It's about coming to terms with history.Lines are drawn in this film, lines of demarcation between Anglos and Latinos and Blacks, between the old and the young, between the past and the present, between truth and memory.  Ultimately, Sayles tries to express that these lines are all results of failure to communicate, failure to come to terms (in the literal sense).  We are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past because we can't seem to learn to listen to one another, to look an old enemy in the face and see not an enemy but a man.If I've made the movie sound highfalutin' and inaccessable, I'm sorry, because it's also a compelling mystery (whose bones are buried on old firing range?), a sweet and sexy love story, and great fun to watch.I'm not one for ranking and lists, but if I had to name the best film of the last ten years (or may favorite film of the last ten years--they wouldn't be the same lists), Lone Star would be alone at the top.

He is the godfather of the independent film movement, working as a writer (often a re-writer called in to rescue a weak script) until he has enough money to make the film he wants on his own, without help from a studio.  I would rather watch the out-takes from any of his films than most completed Hollywood blockbusters.  His writing is always intelligent and complex, with a well-defined political sensibility.  His films challenge the viewer to think, and then to care.  In addition, he has developed a stable of remarkably fine actors (Chris Cooper, David Strathairn, even Gordon Clapp -- those who saw him play a killer in _Matewan_, know his acting range goes far beyond Medavoy on _NYPD Blue_) whom he uses repeatedly and with whom he obviously has a special rapport._Lone Star_ has a lot going for it.  Cooper, Kris Kristofferson, and the best performance yet from Matthew McConaghey.  An interesting social milieu.  A challenging and debatable moral (sometimes it is best, even necessary, to forget history).  A storyline that includes romance, racial divisions, and a murder mystery.  And to those who have called the style Tarantino-ish, I disagree completely.  They may both use flashbacks, but Tarentino does so as a way to subvert traditional narrative, whereas Sayles does so in order to strengthen his narrative by showing us a backstory -- very different things.But in any case, in _Lone Star_  all these elements don't all quite work together.  The romance is a little tepid.  The tension between the white, black, and Mexican communities comes across a bit heavy handedly (unlike in _Matewan_, where the dynamics of a three-sided community -- white Appalachians, blacks, and Italians -- are always unpredictable).  The political message is less effective than in other Sayles movies such as _Men With Guns_, _Eight Men Out_ and the aforementioned _Matewan_, perhaps because 1990's American politics is harder for people to care about; everyone seems too petulant.  The murder mystery isn't much of one.  And both I and the person with whom I saw the film guessed the final revelation about a third of the way into the film.That doesn't make _Lone Star_ a bad film, as I said.  It's better than 90% of the things you can rent.  But it isn't the John Sayles film to start with, if you've never seen one.  Start with _Eight Men Out_, which may be the best baseball movie ever made, or _Matewan_, one of the few movies about the Appalachians that doesn't make everyone out to be Ma & Pa Kettle, or _The Secret of Roan Inish_, a film both children over ten or so and their parents can love.

It must have something to do with the fact that this story is set in Texas, where I was born and have lived most of my life. I was born and spent the first six years of my life in a town along the southern border of Texas, so there is something about the movie that touches me on a primal level. There are layers of symbolism and themes that superimpose themselves one upon the other. There is the theme of cultures colliding and merging and rejecting each other in ways sometimes unholy. There is the theme of history; history within families, history within ethnicities, history within cities and counties and nations. Then there is the classic period murder mystery that pushes the story along. There is one theme that is truly a classic Southern theme; that of The Keeping of Secrets. This keeping of secrets to spare others is probably the theme that rings as true as any other truth in this masterpiece. Every time I see Lone Star (and I have seen it so many times that I have lost track), I see something new and it always rocks me to my soul.

I took one film class in college, but none of those movies struck so many nerves as this one...one of the best movies I've ever seen...not an exaggeration.(A)...so many themes...a great whodunit, father/son relations, first loves, haunting past/present memories, race relations, good cop/bad cop (and grayness in between), immigration, political maneuvering, and probably several others I missed (need to watch it again and again). Somehow they were all blended together and presented in a way that wasn't overwhelming or too cerebral. I have the sense that this film has a timeless quality and will never be dated (kind of like The Godfather). (B)...such perfect casting and understated acting where the story is front and center and the actors blend into it. The story overshadows all else, especially when you realize how little McConaughey and Kristofferson are actually on screen...but their characters are so powerful and dialogue between present-day figures fills in the mythic proportions that these characters take on. Cooper and Pena are fantastic together, and you can feel the smoldering heat that has remained over the years...not necessarily from the dialogue, but the momentary pauses and gazes between them, and the way they don't address things head-on but dance around them because they're too painful or heavy.(C)...I loved the cuts from past to present day...seems like such a simple camera technique but maybe the brilliance is in the simplicity. And the jail scene where Sam helps release Pila's son...as Pila walks off, the camera backs away but locked onto Sam, and you can just feel his enduring but suppressed love, even BEFORE you know the full history between him and Pila...so brilliant! I just love the way the story was revealed slowly and deliberately...no instant, MTV gratification here...the payoff is following and enjoying the slow and winding pace of the story. The bluesy musical arrangements also provided a melancholy backdrop...the Texan landscapes, passionate/deliberate characters, and the sense of loss and passage of time.I definitely need to rush out and rent/buy some Sayles movies, but I can't believe I've never heard of this brilliant, talented individual. After watching Lonestar, I feel so inferior to Sayles...I'm guessing his IQ is in the stratosphere.

I have seen at least a dozen heavily-hyped films documenting years or decades of history and their effect on a family, couple, or town, but I have never seen one that does it as well as this.Sam Deeds, the new sheriff of Rio County, TX, is the town-disappointing son of the legendary late sheriff, Buddy. When a decades-old corpse is discovered on the old Army post outside town, Sam is guided by his resentment of the Great Sheriff and is thus led to unexpected results and meets suspiciously gentle hints to look the other way.The county, town and people are completely fictitious and yet entirely real. The ethnic mix of the area is thrown into sharp focus and gets some surprising kinks (Black Indians, Chicano and Tejano versus Wetback, the Army portrayed as an ethnic group,) and it's all done by subtlety, not speeches. The border politics of the mid-1990s and the frontier mindset of the late 19th century hold equal importance in the development of the characters.In the course of the main story, the plot and subplots reveal how the town copes with the past, and brings us to conclusions we never would have guessed. The film so assiduously avoids stereotypes that it is frankly amazing. These people are not the childishly primitive narrow-minded moralists you would imagine, and Sayles plays with those expectations until the very end.While the heart of the film's success is Sayle's adherence to the rule show, don't tell, he, like every great artist, knows exactly when to break the rules. His characters say the things that have already been implied in the film in order to show their feelings about the diverse legacies of the town's tragic history. Sometimes, this turns the sub-text on its head in astonishing ways.If you want to see how every trick in the book can be employed in a surprisingly organic and accessible way, watch this movie.

I've never seen a more intelligent portrayal of so many types of relationships all at once; fathers & sons, mothers & daughters, siblings, races, economic strata, generations, good & bad. And the acting is superb, including the two best American actors today (Chris Cooper and a cameo from Frances McDormand) amongst a fine cast. All of the characters are memorable, and you will leave the film really knowing at least 15 of them.At the risk of being rude; if you didn't like this movie, you probably didn't get it. It delivers so vastly much more than the sum of its parts. What kind of movie is this? What's it about? That's just it; like Blade Runner, it breaks the bounds of a single genre, and challenges you to read much more into what you see and hear.If you've never seen this film before, I envy the delight of your discovery!

From an ethnic standpoint, its three largest food groups are Black, White, and Mexican.  John Sayles weaves a generations old murder mystery around three families that represent the groups above.  Each of these families has a desire to connect to adjacent generations, but it is often a long arduous process filled with things you might be better off not knowing. Young Sherrif Deeds leads a life haunted by the greatness his community thrust upon his late father who was also the Sherrif of the same county.   Along the way we meet Kris Kristofferson as an evil spirit that haunts families of all walks of life, even from his 40 year old grave. We also see a person who can't connect to her family in any way at all  Deed's ex-wife.   Instead, she wallows in the National Religion of Texas  Football.  Being a fan is the closest to family she can deal with. As the central mystery of the movie unviels itself, all three of the families learn something about themselves, and their neighbors, and how good the whole idea of family, and Texas can be.Sayles flawlessly slides back and forth from the 90's to the 50's with brilliant editing.  The Sherrif and the mayor sitting in the Mexican Restaurant and talking about the mystery has a great segue way as one of them reaches for a tortilla.  The camera zooms in on the hand and tortilla, and then it zooms out as the taco is lifted out of the basket.  The same restaurant is now as it was 40 years earlier, and we pick up on the story the mayor was telling the sherrif in the 90's.My only complaint with the film is a small one in the dialogue. After the young female soldier fails a drug test and is called before her commanding officer (Joe Morton in a stand out job), she says back when I was coming up on 5th street in Houston. I am sure the line was meant to be coming up in the 5th ward, which is a predominantly black neighborhoods, where as 5th street is mostly Mexican American.  This is mildly important as the young soldier is supposed to be from a hellish ghetto back groud.Anyway, I think it is the best Texas movie ever (I am a 6th generation Texan, so I have a bit of a clue).  It gets a slight nod over Giant, Last Picture Show, and Lonesome Dove.

The dialog is taut, filled with innuendo and the subtle understanding of understated meaning that people who have lived in a place all their lives have. Some lines are so parsimonious it takes repeated viewings to see the depth of the subtlety. Yet you don't need that understanding to enjoy this film the first time. In other words, if this is your first viewing, you will enjoy it thoroughly. If it's your hundredth, you will still be engaged until the end, and you will look forward to the next viewing as well.The character development is robust and filled with depth. Even those who are dead when the story takes place are fully developed through both the dialog and their own behavior when scenes from the past occur.There are several subplots yet every one is fully explored, a feat that only an accomplished director would attempt, much less pull off. Add to that the full flavor and aroma of a Texas border town, rendered truly by someone who clearly knew it well, including its prejudices, politics and people, and you have a movie with so many layers you will be peeling for hours.After 143 previous comments, one might wonder why I chose to register just to post another.

It contains startling revelations, an absolutely sizzling script (full of quotable one-liners) and a great cast, ranging from Matthew McConaughey who has little to do, Joe Morton (who you should recognise from Terminator 2, Executive Decision etc), Frances McDormand as a slightly eccentric woman to Chris Cooper (American Beauty) who is phenomenal as the film's lead.Set deep in Texas, near to the Mexican border, the plot starts when two off duty Sergeants find a skull, a Sheriff's badge and a Masonic ring. They belong to Charley Wade, a Sheriff who ruled by fear before one night mysteriously disappearing. Does the new Sheriff's father have something to do with it? I cannot even begin to explain the rest of the plot, you should just go and watch it and see what I mean.As well as the story-telling, the cinematography was beautiful, especially the seamless transitions from the present into flashbacks and memories and then back again - they are brilliantly choreographed, but again you must watch the film to see what I mean.The ending has a very Oldboy-style twist and although I guessed many of the twists to come they did not take away from the film at all, I guessed what had happened but wanted to know why and how.An absolute peach!

Lone Star is solidly on my top 10 list.The story is of Sam Deeds (Cooper) the son of a former popular sheriff Buddy Deeds (McConaughey) of a small border town (loosely patterned after Del Rio, Texas) who returns to take the same job his father had. A skeleton has been discovered on an old military target range, which appears to be that of the murderous racist sheriff Charlie Wade (Kristofferson) who preceded Sam's father.As Sam proceeds to figure out what happened, he reignites a passion he once had for Pilar (Pe√±a), who is working as a teacher. The movie flashes back to the late 1950s into the early 1970s to show the stage from which the main characters have been propelled, and the influences that make the town of Frontera, Texas, the menudo (soup) it is today.The military base near to the town is being shut down, and Big O's, a bar that serves the relatively small number of blacks from the base and town, figures prominently in several plot-related incidents. A parallel story to the families of Sam and Pilar is the story of the family of the new base commander, Colonel Payne (Joe Morton).The colonel's father is Big O, himself, i.e. Otis Payne (Joe Canada). O is a fascinating man, who, though he may have once been irresponsible for abandoning his wife and son, has an intense interest in the bigger picture of who the Paynes truly are. Otis maintains a personal museum with photos and artifacts that go back to his slave ancestors intermarrying with Seminole Indians from Florida.Big O shares these ancestral stories with the colonel's son, O's grandson, who is struggling with his relationship to his own militarily inclined father. Will we find resolution in this family matter? What's brilliant in the film is how Sayles weaves all these different lives together into and out of families, then with families of differing backgrounds&#151;Mexican, Anglo, Indian, African-American&#151;living their stories among other families.The immigration issue comes into play, as well, and it's portrayals such as these that humanize those who so many want to wall out, imprison, or expel. Hey, people, these are people you're talking about here, not alien invaders.The plot thickens and some discoveries are made that may disturb the sensibilities of some in the audience, but I won't give either away.

He'd just disappeared around the same time as $10,000.00 of county funds had up and vanished also.As Cooper investigates a whole lot about the ugly underbelly of racism emerges.

In fact it was so critically lauded that it beat Capote, Munich and Brokeback Mountain at the 2005 Oscar ceremony.Although the film was praised for its originality it owes a lot to John Sayles' masterpiece, Lone Star.Both films deal with racial disputes, although Sayles does with much more subtlety. In Haggis' film, characters seem too clean cut they're either heroes or villains. In Lone Star however the line between good and evil isn't quite as easy to see. We enter a moral grey zone, where our protagonists become antagonists, where villains show a more tender, intellectual side to their characters and where it is almost impossible to tell right from wrong.On top of that, both films have a collection of central protagonists. Instead of focusing on one story, Crash and Lone Star pick a number of 'heroes' to guide us through this moral swamp. And although Haggis' screenplay does this well, it doesn't quite reach the level of complexity that Sayles' does. Lone Star unfolds like a novel. In the film's opening we are presented with a rather simplistic view of a local lawman. But as the film progresses and our narrator changes, we soon realizes there's more to this story than we could have ever imagined...It's always good to see where a film has ripped off from. So go off and see Lone Star today. I'm sure you won't regret it.

In the early 90's, a surge of films kick-started a new generation of westerns, straying from the classic genre defining films of the latter century. Independent film maker John Sayles takes the western for a wild ride through present day Texas in Lone Star.Sayles shows the darker side of the small border town of Fontera, a town where the past haunts its residents, in particular Sheriff Sam Deeds (Chris Cooper). The son of the towns hailed Sheriff, Buddy Deeds (Matthew McConaughey), tries to solve the disappearance of Buddy's predecessor, Charlie Wade (Kris Kristofferson). Buddy turned the corrupted town into a thriving community. After Buddy's reign of justice, the town still has problems with racism, illegal immigrants, and the local military base. Sam is just out looking for peace of mind that will only come from the truth of the fateful night Charlie Wade left town.What started out as the discovery of human remains turns out to be a reliving of the past. Sam goes on a fact finding mission questioning all who came into contact with Buddy or Wade that night. Sam himself is debating whether or not his father was the hero he has been made out to be. Through this ordeal is the rekindling of a love whose flame blew out many years ago. Pilar (Elizabeth Pe√±a) is a local school teacher trying to solve the towns problem with racism. Otis is a night club owner where a stabbing has taken place involving some military personnel, bringing in the Colonel who tries to get answers from Otis about the incident. In the end this cluster of mixed up individuals will all be brought together in a web of climactic events.With a cast of very intimate and complex characters, all Sayles needed were the right actors. He found that in Cooper, McConaughey, Kristoffereson, and a host of note worthy performers. To compliment the acting and the gripping screenplay, Sayles uses bold camera work to draw the audience closer to the film. The overlap of past and present in the same shot serves up a new style of filming that works, breaking all set boundaries of time conception. The film is spectacular thanks to Sayles ingenious work.The story of Lone Star is a combination of a murder mystery and social conflicts. Sayles utilizes the mysterious landscape that is the west to make the story seem that much more intriguing, hitting home with such content relevant to today's society. The location is remote enough to seem distant from our lives, but close enough not be conceived as foreign. It is a perfect equilibrium for the setting.Sayles's chilling tale from the Lone Star State is nothing short of breathtaking. His fluid camera movement captures every emotion protruding from the actors. What might seem like a far-fetched storyline, too dark and twisted for cinema, just goes to show you that the west still has its unknown territory just waiting to be used.

I enjoyed the film but I did not fully understand it. The film is constructed like a jigsaw puzzle. The information comes in random order and we must connect the pieces. The second time I saw it was with a group of people. Each time a person made a connection, it was spoken out loud so that all would get it. We even stopped the tape occasionally to clarify our knowledge. By the time that the film was over, we had it all straightened out. One of the main problems was that the film ran in two time frames the current time and the events leading up to the killing and we must learn to recognize some characters in both time frames. Another problem was that there were many people involved and we had to figure out their relationships. Also there were many subplots that had to be connected. If viewing it alone, taking notes would be a great help. Also, many times, there were many moral issues that had to be considered. The film moves on at a pace too fast to absorb everything, a problem that disappears when a tape can be paused.The story begins with the discovery of a skeleton in the desert. The sheriff suspects that it was that of an evil predecessor, Charlie Wade, and that the killer might have been his own deceased father, a deputy sheriff and local hero, Buddy Deeds. Anything else that I tell you would spoil the film. Learn these three names and note all of the other names and relationships as you hear them, in your head or on paper. A second viewing would really clarify the story; the film is good enough for multiple viewings. Days later you could still be thinking about some of the moral issues.

Like the investigation into the meaning of rosebud in Citizen Kane, the discovery of a skull and the resulting investigation uncovers the complexities of life in a small community.I can't think of a single theme Sayles doesn't allude to in this film (man v. man, man v. himself, man v. nature, man v. time, present v. past, son v. father, daughter v. mother, race v. race, culture v. culture, etc.), and his use of metaphors (some obvious, some considerably less so) shows he has a great deal of respect for both his characters and the audience. Underlying everything is the idea that things are rarely as they appear, that no person's version of history is an absolute, and that it is only through understanding and coming to terms with our past that we can truly embrace the future.While I could wax poetic about the cinematography, camera angles, scene transitions, Sayle's ability to capture the true essence of a small border town in Texas (right down to the Shiner Bock beer - which wasn't widely available when Lone Star was filmed), what I find most remarkable is that in almost twenty viewings of this film, I learn something new about the characters and ultimately discover more about myself with each subsequent viewing.

If his script fails to portray the development and intersection of ethnic relations, marital relations, migration, cultural assimilation, politics, education, big business, and even the army in the southern and western United States, from the Treaty of Payne's Landing and eviction of the Seminoles from Florida in 1832 to the cross-border migration of Mexicans to south Texas in the 1990's, it's not for lack of trying. The sweep of his screenplay aspires to be nothing less than multi-generational, multi-ethnic, multi-class, multi-marriage -- in a word, epic. . . . Alas, the script does ultimately fail. It fails because the screenwriter spends too much time having characters lecture each other for the benefit of the audience and too little time creating dramatic incidents through which the audience might see important issues articulated, developed, and resolved. As Laura Miller puts it in her Salon review, The independent filmmaker John Sayles reminds me of Gertrude Stein's description of Ezra Pound 'He is a village explainer. All very well if you happen to be a village. If not, not.' More simply, Sayles is not Chekhov, and his movie is not The Ox-Bow Incident or To Kill a Mockingbird. . . . The acting, or perhaps it is the direction of the acting, is a problem here too. Character actor Chris Cooper plays a rural sheriff faced with two cold cases -- a 40-year-old homicide and a father he never knew -- with such lack of affect that you want to kick some life into the guy. (I saw him as Sheriff Deeds, all right, but kept hearing the same dull voice he would later bring to FBI operative Robert Hanssen in Breach.) Comely Elizabeth Pe√±a plays his romantic interest with a ground-down-by-life monotone and an accent that sounds more South Bronx than South Texas. Miriam Colon, as Pe√±a's restaurateur mother, is given almost nothing but acerbic, if not hateful, lines to deliver. Even the wonderful Frances McDormand, who received the Academy Award for her role in Fargo the same year that Lone Star came out, is over-the-top in a comic turn as Sheriff Deeds' ex-wife Bunny. Only Kris Kristofferson, as the heavy Charlie Wade, and Joe Morton, as an Army colonel who's all spit, vinegar, and heart, are consistently fun to watch. . . .

The story, however, quickly veers into Sayles' more familiar territory political correctness and preaching more about racial tolerance, more on that than on the crime story. As a result, the story bogs down quickly, and never really recovers.Sayles is like many liberal filmmakers, soothes his conscience, apparently, by spewing his left wing diatribes over and over such as always showing white people and-or law enforcement as hateful racists. Right-wing politicos are always been evil, and all minorities innocent victims (rarely, if ever, perpetrators) from these hate-filled Caucasians. You get a lot of diversity here and it winds up being more soap opera than crime. In this film, we get a good mix of white, black and Hispanic as the story takes place in border town in Texas. Another key element of the story is dysfunctional families, another favorite topic of today's filmmakers. They must speak from experience. Here, the sheriff thinks his father - also a sheriff - might have been a murderer. Those who love small-town corruption stories, where everyone has a million skeletons in their closet, should like this cultural crime soaper. The cover of the DVD or VHS make may this film sound like it's a crime story but don't be fooled it's pure soap. It is a slow two and a quarter hours of political correctness gone amok. Nuff said.

I was also expecting more Michael Mchonohay, maybe if the film had been 1 half set in the present with the Sheriff and then the other half set in the past. Instead we get a bunch of stories about different people of the town that is meant to represent some sort of portrait of America, but they don't interlock the way 'Crash', 'Babel', 'Nashville', or other films do. It's a film trying to be ensemble when it doesn't need to. It probably would have worked better as a TV show, as too many of the loose threads lack that satisfying cohesiveness that a film should offer.The relationship between Sam and Pilar is also quite strange, and by the end, rather off-putting. In addition, the revelation about their past seems completely out of left field and of no relation to the central aspect of the story... or maybe it does in a weird sort of way. Either way, I feel that Sayles script is a little too 1990s PC for my tastes. Much of the moralizing between the characters (save for one brilliant scene outside a Mexican gas station) feels like something out of Schoolhouse Rock.Additionally, I thought the 'who-dunnit' murder plot was rather straightforward. Seeing Kristofferson's evil was entertaining, but I would have expected a bigger reveal or a more interesting resolution to his story.Maybe I was just let down by all the hype. I gave it a 6/10.

Would that film makers like him could take over the studios and offer the public films that are both entertaining, technically astute, and capable of real insight.

It has the plot plot plus several other subplots between various characters that sadly don't get resolved by the end of the movie. Only the main characters(Chris Cooper & Liz Pena) come to grips with their fate by the end of the movie and the other plots between the other characters just stop. The movie run time is about 2 1/2 hours and you'd think that would be enough time to wrap up all the subplot as well as the main plot. For instance, what happens to the black female sargeant and her white equal counterpart who wanted to get married? Do Col. Payne and his father mend their differences?

As he investigates how his father came to power, he also reunites with a former lover, Pilar Cruz (Elizabeth Pena). While the murder mystery and the love story wind their way to a climax, there are many other story lines that reveal the realities of modern-day Texas' uneasy racial and ethnic structure.

While he puzzles out the long-past events, Sam also tries to restart a romance with his old high-school flame, but in a town where nothing is what it seems, that can be a very difficult thing to do...What I liked most about this movie was the fact that the characters had some depth. What I fear most about many movies is that the characters are too easy to understand, making you know everything about them too quickly in the movie. That's certainly not the case with this movie. Even at the end of it, you'll get some surprising information about some people. I'm not going to tell you what that is of course, because I don't want to spoil the fun, but it sure works. But despite the fact that the characters have been well developed, it doesn't save the entire story of the movie. Somehow it all looked a bit too stereotypical and obvious.Despite the fact that this movie doesn't have any real big names in the cast, the acting certainly is OK and the same can be said about the direction of John Sayles. What he did with this movie wasn't exactly the most original approach possible, but it worked and that's what counts. Overall I liked it enough to recommend it, but it just isn't worth the actual rating. I would rather like to give it a 6.5/10.

The opening leads you to believe that you're in for a murder mystery focusing around the investigation into the identity of both the victim and the killer. Instead, the investigation (such as it is, and it's pretty weakly portrayed) definitely fades into the background, with the movie instead focusing on the tension between the white, latino and black communities in this small town on the Texas-Mexico border, on the tensions within those communities and on the tensions between families within the communities. Parent-child relationships are definitely strained. The focus is on the relationship between current sheriff Deeds and his father, a former legendary sheriff in the same town (played in flashbacks by Matthew McConaghey), but there are other families portrayed as well - frankly too many, especially given that I didn't find many of the family issues all that interesting.In fact, I thought the whole movie was rather dry. For all the tensions portrayed (that I mentioned above) nothing really dramatic happens because of them. It's kind of like watching a movie about your next door neighbours. They're nice folks, but do you need two and a half hours about them? I give director John Sayles credit for the seamless way he worked the flashbacks into the main story, and the resolution of the mystery around the killer came as a bit of a surprise to me. I can't, however, say that I found any of this riveting. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Sluggish Is Different Than Leisurely","Date":"16 June 2009","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" The appeal of John Sayles films has always eluded me.There's a difference between leisurely and thoughtful storytelling and lacklustre, sluggish storytelling, but Sayles doesn't seem to know it. This film about a bunch of secrets long thought buried in a Texas border town is probably the best Sayles film I've seen, but that's not saying all that much.Chris Cooper, Elizabeth Pena and a young, mostly unknown Matthew McConaughey star.

For a Yankee like me, the setting, the characters and the poignant story were a treat. Beautifully written, so well played and totally engrossing, how DID they do this for $ 5 million. While not all of John Sayles inexpensive productions work for me, this absolutely entertaining film, with many things to say, should have taken in far more money and acclaim. Well, at least Hollywood writers had the smarts to grant Sayles an Oscar nomination for this one.Super cast (Chris Cooper first caught my attention in this one), this rates a 10 for me. Enjoy!

Excellent John Sayles flick about a small town in Texas facing the ugly roots of history when the remains of a missing sheriff is found in the desert opening an entire can of worms with some Hitchcockian moments of wallow.  Great ensemble cast particularly Cooper the current lawman investigating the crime and recognizing the evil all around as well as the questionablity of his father's image as the last good sheriff.

The story is excellent, as is the cast, but the direction and editing reflect the all too prevalent attitude among present-day filmmakers that clarity of story presentation is of relatively little importance. Pity, because this could have been a great film.

I like John Sayle's Brother From Another Planet and The Secret Of Roan Inish, but Lone Star falls completely flat. I remember the time of the release that it received a lot of critic's praise; either I'm an ingrate who doesn't know how to like a movie, or this film is basically a long, boring exercise with slow stretches, low-chemistry romance and thin characters. The plot seems all too familiar, and it shouldn't take long to predict the outcome.

Before you watch it, I would recommend being comfortable with Tarantino-style flicks. This movie jumps around a lot, and tends to get too caught up in exposition rather than telling a story.

Nor do I care...Slow and boring. One of the most tedious films I've never watched. Others that lost me before the end Perfect Storm (actually only 10 minutes in) and The Hours (ghastly). Oh yes and Atonement. Strange how the film industry has declined in every department over the years. I suppose it's the audience.Typical clich√©d modern film making at its worst. Poor in every department - just another excuse to bash people over the head with the same old liberal politics in place of entertainment. Utter crap.
