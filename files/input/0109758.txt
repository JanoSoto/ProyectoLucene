Why Gary Marshall chose to turn a great novel into a non-funny comedy with the miscasting of Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd is beyond me. The subject of this movie has never been dealt with in a non-X movie and it should have been done with tact instead of a loose comedy hand. The cast is good except the above duo. Dana Delany is great as the Mistress of a pleasure island; she takes a chance and shows her sexy side of herself as well as full body nudity.

I think the problem lies mainly in the marketing.  Like many people who viewed this film, I thought it would be a comedy.  It is, to a degree.  Judging by the subject matter, I knew Exit would be at least somewhat risque, but since I found out Garry Marshall directed it, I assumed it would be tastefully done with little or no nudity.  After all, this is the guy who directed films like Runaway Bride and The Princess Diaries, and I think he produced Laverne and Shirley.  Naturally, I wasn't expecting softcore porn! Maybe this isn't an EXACT clone of a late night movie on Cinemax, but it comes pretty close.  I guess I would compare this with certain adult comedies like The Bikini Carwash Company and Beauty School.I was entertained and stimulated by some of the nude scenes, and I never knew Dana Delaney had such an AWESOME body!  I will never look at her the same ever again!  And you've got the handsome Aussie, Paul Mercurio, so there's something for the guys and gals to enjoy.  Unfortunately, I kept waiting for something funny to happen and my patience was running low.Many people think of Rosie O'Donnell as an annoying you-know-what, but that's because many of those people didn't know her until she started doing her talk show.  I watched her show sometimes, but I admit there were times where I just wanted to slug her.  But she was putting on a sing-songy, G-rated persona for the show.  I've seen her one of her stand-up acts on television, and quite a few words had to be bleeped.  So trust me, she doesn't have the same clean-cut persona you've seen in her talk show.  And she does have a reasonable amount of talent as a comedienne, which is why I wanted to check out the film in the first place.  At times she's funny, at times she's not, due to faulty writing and forced comic timing.  Dan Aykroyd has a few funny moments as well, but also seems humiliated to be in this movie.  Don't expect the same high-energy, manic Aykroyd performance he usually delivers.Exit to Eden works out well as softcore porn, but doesn't totally deliver as a comedy.  The film would've worked out better, if it didn't suffer from this identity crisis.My score  5 (out of 10) "},{"Title":"'Wacky' Comedy/Bondage Romance Mix Fails At Both...","Date":"31 March 2004","Score":"18 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Romance","Review":"  One thing can be said about veteran director Garry Marshall; he'll go nearly ANYWHERE for love and laughs.EXIT TO EDEN may be about as unlikely a mainstream comedy/romance as you'll find, with most of the action occurring at a 'Club Med'-type resort catering to S&M devotees, but someone, somewhere, might have been able to pull it off...but not, unfortunately, the ever-conventional Marshall, who, try as he might, can't make either the comedy (as two cops attempt to infiltrate the club to capture a fugitive 'hiding out' among the 'mistresses' and 'slaves') or the love story (as a somewhat jaded 'mistress' discovers the joys of conventional romance with a mysterious newcomer) more than mildly entertaining.The main problem is miscasting; while a Dan Aykroyd/Rosie O'Donnell team-up might have looked good on paper, on film the two actors have virtually no chemistry together. Aykroyd is better as a 'straight man' than comic, and, as age has given him a 'cuddly' quality (along with extra pounds), the edginess he displayed in THE BLUES BROTHERS or even DRAGNET is gone. O'Donnell, on the other hand, is TOO edgy, and can become annoying quite easily. Her one-liners seem contrived and often mean-spirited...and Rosie in leather is a sight I've been trying to forget for 10 years! Dana Delany fares somewhat better, as the Number 1 Dominatrix (her voluptuous curves, encased in leather, and brief nude scenes have made EXIT TO EDEN a video store favorite), but her personality, fundamentally sweet-natured (more 'Girl Next Door' than 'Supervixen') plays against her. She is simply too 'nice' for her role! Coming off best is Australian newcomer Paul Mercurio, in his first American film. With a twinkle in his eye, he 'plays' the S&M 'game' as a joke, championing traditional romance, and, ultimately, converts Delany to his point of view. Totally natural, Mercurio 'steals' the film from the veteran cast. He, and Marshall 'regular' Hector Elizondo are both so good, in fact, that they seem to have been 'lifted' from a different film!EXIT TO EDEN stumbles frequently, in it's attempt to be both mainstream AND daring, and ends up being boring and a bit distasteful.PRETTY WOMAN, it ain't!

Strictly Ballroom is one of my favorite movies ever, but-- he seemed to be just eye-candy here.  Why, oh why, hasn't he been really acting since?  Dana Delaney was beautiful, but she didn't seem at all fierce, dangerous, as I would have hoped big bad Mistress Lisa would be.

The main problem that I had watching it was the lack of any true laugh out loud funny lines. I did chuckle a few times but for a movie that's supposed to be such an outrageous comedy, it really didn't ever get truly hilarious. Also, what bothered me was the lack of cohesiveness to the story. The thing that came to mind when watching it was that it seemed like it had no structure. It was almost seemed like the cast just got together and decided to ham it up and see how outrageous they could get. It didn't really flow and sometimes it almost seemed like the cast could have been making up their lines spur of the moment. Everyone involved seemed to be having a good time but it looked at times like they forgot about the audience. It was watchable but at times just sort of THERE, and never hooked me in.It had no problem keeping my attention but never became compelling or even very interesting. Storyline seemed to be thrown out in favor of clowning around and trying for outrageousness but something was missing. It's not really a movie that makes you want to view it Twice.Having said that, I will also say this isn't dreadful and I've certainly seen worse. I'd give this about an average rating (5 of 10).

You Got Served and Glitter are obviously bad, but this movie is subtly the worst movie I have ever seen. I think that after Basic Instinct some Hollywood exec thought Hmm this is the next big thing, mainstream movies with tons of nudity and sex! The problem with this thought is that a)that wasn't the next big thing and b) this movie has none of the traits of a mainstream movie. The acting in this movie is horrendous, aside from Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd who play second fiddle to a couple of porn rate actors, the plot is awkward because it has to squeeze in so much sex and the directing kind of feels like a porn movie. The plot is the worst part, in my opinion, there are two distinct plots in the movie that intersect a couple of times and finally conclude concurrently. Nothing all that unusual there, but both plots are so meaningless and free from suspense that the only plot device evident is the switch between soft core sex scenes to Dan and Rosie standing around waiting for something to happen. The only reason to watch this movie is if you really need to see some nudity, and even the sex scenes are nothing special. Most are just standard soft core porn, only in order to pass it off as a mainstream movie even those are cut short. I vaguely remembered when this movie came out and I was pretty excited when it came on HBO, but it was so bad that I could barely go to sleep.

The film-makers took Rice's basic plot and turned it into a comedy, although still set against the background of the world of sadomasochism, and added a plot line about two cops in pursuit of two diamond thieves, thereby creating the world's first sadomasochistic buddy-buddy-cop comedy-crime-thriller.Elliott Slater, a professional photographer, books into Eden, an island holiday resort catering for sadomasochists. Unknown to him, he has been followed to the island by Omar and Nina, two ruthless criminals who are trying to retrieve the film from Elliott's camera- this was in the pre-digital era- which contains a shot which could identify Omar as one of the participants in a jewel heist. Also on the island are the two bumbling Los Angeles cops, Fred and Sheila. Another strand to the plot concerns the growing romance between Elliott and the resort's resident dominatrix, Mistress Lisa, even though the strict etiquette of her profession means that she is not supposed to fall in love with her clients. Sheila also finds romance at the end of the film when a handsome young stud, who also turns out to be a company Chief Executive, falls for her.Back in 1994 the idea for this film might have seemed like a good one, at least to the film-makers. It wasn't. The film proved a flop, both critically and financially. Dan Aykroyd, who at his best can be a very good actor, was nominated for a Worst Supporting Actor Razzie for his portrayal of Fred, and Rosie O'Donnell, as Sheila, won Worst Supporting Actress. O'Donnell, who is hardly Hollywood's greatest glamour-puss, spends much of the running-time dressed in skimpy bondage attire, even though she has to compete with equally scantily dressed co-stars as attractive as Dana Delany and the gorgeous supermodel Iman. There should be a special Razzie for Actress Most in Need of Less Revealing Clothing. Despite her good looks, Delany is not commanding enough to suggest that her character could make a career as a dominatrix, and Iman does little to counteract the widely held view that supermodels are generally ill- advised to exchange the catwalk for the film set. Several other top models were attempting to break into acting during the nineties, but Iman is no better an actress than the likes of Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Elle Macpherson. Indeed, she is probably rather worse, which is saying something. She comes across as the least menacing criminal I have ever seen. She can't even sneeze convincingly. As for Paul Mercutio- well, I really can't remember much about his performance. And I only saw the film yesterday.Dodgy acting is not the only problem with this film. It is supposed to be a comedy, but it is completely unfunny; I can't think of a single situation or line of dialogue which made we want to laugh with the actors as opposed to laughing at them. It is no classic of erotica, but there is enough suggestive dialogue and enough bare flesh on display to ensure it got an 18 rating, something unusual for a comedy. I felt that this was a mistake on the part of the film-makers. No film about sexual sadomasochism is ever going to be suitable for the family audience, but that 18 certificate means that it also excluded the sniggering adolescent audience, who are the only demographic who might find it in any way amusing. There may be some people who retain the sniggering adolescent mentality well after their eighteenth birthday, but there were evidently not enough of them to save the film from its well-deserved box-office failure.I was surprised to learn that this rubbish was directed by Garry Marshall, who had previously made romantic comedies and dramas as good as Overboard, Pretty Woman and Frankie and Johnny. Exit to Eden may be the world's first sadomasochistic buddy-buddy-cop comedy-crime- thriller.

One thing you do not see too much of in mainstream film is such explicit sexuality. Therefore it is an odd movie. If not for the setting of a Sado-Masochistic Island this would be a routine crime drama, but this truly unique element makes this movie a little different from the rest.A photographer who is internationally renowned has serious problems with women, and therefore he thinks it best to attend a sadist colony to further enhance his sexual life. What he doesn't realize is that he accidentally saw a man who is an international diamond smuggler, and no one has seen this diamond smuggler out of disguise, so this man naturally has to be killed so cops can't identify him. He goes to a sadist colony where two cops, played by Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd track him down to get the thief and save his life.  The lead of the movie is Dana Delany who plays the person in charge of this colony. I am not going to lie this is one strange movie which suffers from among other things a weak lead in Dana Delany, who has some high points but really can't hold this together.Some people blasted this movie.  I did not think it was that bad.  But above all else it was very very strange.  There is a huge amount of sexual content and to add to that a huge amount of unusual sexual content.

The *ONLY* reason the incredibly stupid scenes with Rosie O'Donnell & Dan Aykroyd are in this movie at all is because the studio and/or the director felt that a serious drama involving S&M would make some people uncomfortable. So they figured people would only watch it if they included a couple buffoons to make fun of all the 'sick' people and activities in the movie so that the audience could feel ok laughing at them. Maybe one day, the studio will take all the erotic footage they cut out prior to its release and replace all the idiotic scenes with O'Donnell & Aykroyd and release the drama they should have made in the first place.

Unlike most movies which use s&m and b&d as tools to orchestrate a character's psychotic behavior, or to show a ridiculous or funny fetish trait of someones, Exit to Eden shows s&m in a very flattering light--portraying it as sensual and serious, but also playful and fun. Since the subject of this lifestyle has rarely been explored in mainstream movies, this is very important and I would even dare to say groundbreaking, in terms of working to eliminate taboos and misconceptions about a subject through the cinematic medium. Like movies which have dared to display gay and interracial relationships in a realistic light, rather than pandering to cliched stereotypes, Exit to Eden shows that s&m culture can be a very normal, non-violent part of the average person's life. Yes, some of the lines are corny and the acting is less than convincing, but Delany and Mercurio make a dynamite couple with some great chemistry. All in all, I would say this was a decent movie which provides a great service--educating the public about s&m culture--and one which breaks new ground in its presentation of its subject matter.

This smorgasbord of genres does end up being more than the sum of its parts, but going in the direction of greatly awful instead of greatly good.What makes matters worse is all the talent that's wasted here, including Dan Ackroyd and the two charismatic leads, Dana Delany and Paul Mercurio.  I sometimes think that for all their wealth, fame, and glamor, actors really do have the worst lives.  During the film-making process they must trust to the judgment of their director and hope that everything they do (no matter how uncomfortable or embarrassing) is for a good purpose.  Sadly here, Delaney and Mercurio's faith in their director, Garry Marshall, is badly misplaced.  The two have to bare a lot of flesh before this movie is through (poor Dana even goes full frontal in one scene) and all for what? Performances that are potential career killers?  Stars on the scale of Ackroyd can survive a flop even as bad as this and Marshall, after the success of Runaway Bride, is sure to be around for a while.

Coupled with an overly long plot that regularly goes MIA, and drags when it does show up for duty, 1994's Exit to Eden makes notable turkey Gigli seem as romantic as Brief Encounte! It's all so comically bad it feels like it should be in German - a la the old late night movies found in the higher channel numbers in the early days of satellite TV. In the right hands, or with a more daring director or provocative censor, this film set in a holiday resort run by a dominatrix could have been quite interesting, but unfortunately tiptoes around anything more controversial than an occasional tap with a hairbrush.The laughable, risible plot involves a pair of jewel thieves and a pair of cops going undercover at a BDSM resort to retrieve a film canister containing photos of a jewel robbery, while various couples visualise and act out their assorted TV-friendly fantasies. That's pretty much all that is needed.It's hard to know what aspect of the film drags it down the most, but perennially bad actress Rosie O'Donnell probably takes the...er....Oscar! Her awful dialogue delivery, grating voice-over, and even her harsh New York accent for an LA cop is grating. Meanwhile the plot is almost incidental to the film, serving seemingly only as a way to string a few soft bondage scenes and awkward interactions together, and the reason for why the cops and thieves are there is largely forgotten for large portions of the film. But the scenes aren't particularly arousing enough for the film to be much of an erotic thriller, and the story isn't even remotely gripping enough to fulfil the thriller aspect either. Meanwhile Dan Aykroyd's hammy delivery, while seemingly perfect for Ghostbusters, seems to merely add to the film's overall corniness. When the plot finally does make a return to the film, it drags the already-meandering pace of the film down to an absolute crawl, and by the time the film approaches its 'climax' (and never was a term so inaccurate on so many levels) after nearly 2 hours, a life of celibacy may suddenly have some appeal.Ask for a refund of both your time and money.Dire.

He's going to live out his dream as being a submissive man who loves being spanked. He accidentally photographs a vicious criminal named Omar (Stuart Wilson) getting drugs. Omar and helper Nina (Iman) follow Elliot to the island to get the film--and kill him. Police officers Sheila (Rosie O'Donnell) and Fred (Dan Aykroyd) are in hot pursuit. On the island the head--Mistress Lisa (Dan Delany)--takes it upon herself to train Elliot--and starts falling in love which she has vowed never to do.This is an adaptation (a VERY loose one) of an Anne Rice book that is just about sex, bondage, S&M and the love between Elliot and Lisa. There's no stupid drug story. It's a very good and very adult book. The movie basically sanitizes the book a great deal (everyone's nude in the book--not here), throws the insights into sex out the window and adds nonstop wisecracks from O'Donnell. Now, I like O'Donnell and some of her lines ARE funny but the movie's tone keeps zigzagging between comedy, suspense, love and nudity. It's all over the place and never finds a comfortable footing. Also Iman is (to put it mildly) a terrible actress. Still I really like this! The island locale is just beautiful (it was shot in Hawaii) and the resort itself is incredible. There's plenty of casual female nudity--even Delany has a full frontal nude shot! There is some male nudity but mostly back views. Supposedly there were full frontal shots of Mercurio but they had to cut them or they would have gotten an X rating. That doesn't make a bit of sense...but the ratings board always is afraid of male nudity. Still, there are a lot of hunky guys wandering around wearing next to nothing. Also Paul Mercurio has a fantastic butt and you get plenty of views of it! In terms of acting this is pretty good. Mercurio struggles with his accent (it's half-Australian, half-American) but he's handsome, in good shape and has no problem in strutting around half-naked. His acting is good too) Delany looks incredible and gives an excellent performance as a dominatrix. O'Donnell is throwing off jokes left and right. Some are funny and she does it so casually it makes them even funnier. Aykroyd however is wasted. Also the movie is a little bit too long. Still this is worth seeing for the beautiful locations, the casual nudity, some truly funny bits and acting. If you're easily offended by frank talk of S&M and nudity stay FAR away. A huge bomb when it came out but this (hopefully) might be rediscovered some day. There's also a cute joke at the very end of the closing credits. I give this an 8.

It is simply a non-stop barrage of boring and/or stupid scenes, with laughs at a minimum and a great deal of talent horribly wasted.  And the worst part is that they dragged this out for almost two hours...there wasn't even enough material here to make an entertaining half-hour sitcom.  So once again, I strongly urge you not to waste your time with this misfire.  Trust me.

I agree 100% with this. The video is advertised by some as being 120 minute, which it is not. 113m at most. It does look longer, though, because the only good moments, and funny moments, are those in which O'Donnell is on screen.Rosie O'Donnell, then a 32 year-old chubby Irish woman, is a pleasure to hear and to watch as undercover cop Sheila, exiting to Eden, an Eden/Eros resort in Hawaii, where very dangerous criminals are hiding&#133; Mandatory viewing for her fans but even more, for all those who believe (despite of the media) that chubby women can be both beautiful and luscious. Rosie is a big (pun intended), seductive surprise for those who (like me) had not known her before. She plays well, with no creditable supporting actors; even Dan Ackroyd was at one of his lowest moments.  She is much more beautiful than she looks in the poor photographs of the video cover, and she did conquer me, early in the film, by her dramatic art. She did not need to dress that black leather metal studded, highly revealing dominatrix outfit, but, well, I did not mind seeing her in it, either. She has three exchanges with &#145;gangmoll' Iman, defeating her with quick speech, and bureaucratic talk twice, disarming the &#145;killer with no brains'. The third time, she fights her hand-to-hand (black vs red dominatrix outfits, too!) and ends the fight with a KO right cross to the jaw, that ends all arguments.  May be I'm being too critical on what is intended as a romantic, slightly spiced comedy; but in all truth, the only acting I liked came from funny, yet deep, thoughtful Rosie O'Donnell. Buy it cheap, or rent it for her.

Not even mediocre.  It is bad.  But, hey, it's pretty entertaining despite that.What is bad about it?  The acting, the script (based on one of Anne Rice's more indulgent and stupid novels; hard to believe it was written by the author of IWTV.), the set design.  Most of the humor.What is worth seeing?  Well, Dana Delaney and Paul Mercurio are fairly attractive people.  Yes, the humor is bad, but Rosie O'Donnell's voice-overs are very funny.Not something you would be proud to list as a favorite movie, but entertaining if you see it in the right light.

As others have pointed out, the only thing in it worth seeing is a momentary glimpse of Dana Delaney totally nude, including her luxuriant growth of pubic hair, obviously shot back in the days before Generation X began dominating the media with their peculiar aversion to anything natural, especially hair. Still, her brief nude scene is not enough for this piece of drek to find a permanent slot in your video library even if you got it for free. That Aussie jerk ruined it from the first moment he appeared on screen. Whoever gave him the idea that he could act, that he understood the first thing about photography, that his croc hunter accent was somehow cool, or that his big fat ass was sexy and ought to be shoved in our faces for an hour and a half? If you're not a woman or hopelessly gay, a movie where beefcake men run around in thongs is what we used to call a real gross-out. Admittedly, there were a handful of scenes containing cute, half-naked babes that deserved a second look, but otherwise, this horrible excuse for cinema was a groan from start to finish, actually worse than a bad Loveboat episode, if that is possible. Rosie O'Donnel wasn't exactly good in it but she was far from its worst feature, and that alone ought to tell you something. When she kissed her submissive at the end, she was far more convincing as a straight woman than he was as a straight man. Put another way, whoever had the idea to pair a dike with an obvious fairy and call it erotic ought to have their heads examined. I had to ask my old lady three or four separate times if anyone saw her take this piece of tripe from the library sale rack and am embarrassed we watched the whole thing.

The jewel theft storyline is really only an excuse to showcase alternative lifestyle acceptance and Rosie ODonnell one liners. Even the nudity and sexual content, while mostly good, is not nearly strong enough to redeem in any way this movie. If you want to waste everyones time with an overview of the S/M lifestyle, who cares. But to have it then all narrated (execessively) by un-un-unfunny Rosie ODonnell with apparent ad-libs if you can believe it, is a migrainal experience that will have you personally blacklist any other movies by all parties involved. Another bicarbonate if you would, Jeeves.

Dana Delany looks like the sexiest women in the world in that movie.But there's more to it than that....Rosie O'Donnel is extremely comical in parodying the whole content of the movie throughout all her scenes. Dan Akroyd only adds to the comedy as an amazing supporting actor.Paul Mercurio is so under-rated it's not funny. He should be starring in HUGE motion pictures by now!All in all, Dana Delany did her best work in the best movie there ever was.

When they work,  the reasons why are too tied to the mysteries of perception to tease out. Like  explanations of the economy, they are all speculations bound to be bogus. But failures  are easier to understand and appreciate.Gerry Marshall has accumulated some heavy karma by leading the transformation of  TeeVee comedy from clever to attractively insipid. His formula was to find some niche of  ordinary humanity, turn it into an endearing morsel by poking gentle fun at it in the  context of general wackiness.As time goes on, the wackiness becomes more strained and the poking more frantic, but  still ever gentle. This cross between a sitcom and a sexually colored chic flick fails  because of that gentility. The rest of the humor world would have been more ruthless in  exploiting one side (usually the sex side) or the other.On the Club Med side, consider Peter O'Tooles comment in `Club Paradise` that he  doesn't want to sit in any of the chairs because of the abundant fluids therein. Or look at  the more recent sitcom bondage synthesis, the very good `Secretary.'Or even the bondage scenes in `Romance,' which are the only ones that have that Hal  Hartley-inspired distant humor to them.One story follows our purveyors of whack, Rosie and Dan, neither of whom know just  what the target is supposed to be. The other story - in the other genre - is a traditional  date movie wrapped in an abstract world. It has little to do with actual sex, and even less  with real master-submissive dynamics and perversions.It exists - along with all sorts of complicated baggage about guests and `citizens' -  only to support a few jokes, and a surprising few indeed. One is Iman's only reason for  being here a faux humping of her (as a thin Natasha) and Rosie (as a winking dumpling).How much sweeter this would have all been if we knew and exploited Rosie's own  alternative sexual identity.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.
