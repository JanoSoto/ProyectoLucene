Here you have the biggest star in Hollywood history, making a film that symbolizes his life. You have an aging actor, whose best days were past him, portraying an aging gunfighter, whose best days were behind him. You have a character trying to fit into a world that had changed too much. Much like Wayne was trying to fit into a changing America. Lastly, you had a character, dying of cancer, trying to accomplish one last thing. Wayne, who was also dying of cancer, like the character, was trying to accomplish one last thing, a great film. To me, this film is special, because you are seeing in real life, a dying icon make his farewell. Like the character JB Books, Wayne was trying to put a brave face on his final days. He was vulnerable and uncertain about what awaited him, but he sought to accomplish one last goal. I don't care if you like Wayne or not, but how someone could not be emotionally effected by seeing this legend on screen for his last time, well, I feel sorry for you. This film is very special to me.

Books has in the past killed thirty men in gunfights and has become a legend of the West, but this hard-won status has brought him unwelcome attention from would-be gunslingers hoping to gain their own place in history as `the man who shot J B Books'. Early on, Books is told by his old friend Dr Hostetler that he is dying of terminal cancer, and the film chronicles the last week of his life, from 22nd to 29th January 1901, his search for a dignified death in accordance with his own code of honour.The film is about both endings and new beginnings, so it is significant that the action takes place in the first month of a new century. January 1901 marked not only the beginning of a century, but also the end of an era, because it was the month in which Queen Victoria died; this event is referred to several times in the film. The days of the `Old West' were also coming to an end; under the influence of new inventions such as the motor car and the telephone (both of which appear in the film) it was becoming a quieter and less lawless place.The time of year is significant in another way. A film which is about both the end of a man's life and the end of an era will inevitably be elegiac in tone, and the standard way of making it would be to film it in autumn, with plenty of shots of falling leaves and grey, misty skies. Don Siegel, however, takes an alternative approach, setting the film during a brief period of brilliant winter sunshine and mild weather known as a `false spring'. This not only provides some strikingly beautiful images, but also has a double symbolic meaning. For Books and for the Old West it is winter; but for the younger generation, spring is coming. One of the most touching features of the film is the relationship between Books and Gillom, the son of his landlady. Gillom idolises Books and treats him as a hero; Books, in the last days of his life, treats the young man as the son he never had and tries to teach him that there is a better way than that of the gun. The Old West may be passing into history, but there are indications that the New West, although it may be less picturesque, will be a better place in which to live. If winter comes, can spring be far behind?The film itself also turned out to mark the end of an era in more ways than one. Although there is some doubt whether Wayne actually knew in 1976 that his cancer had returned, we now of course know that it was to be his last film and that he was to die about three years later, and this knowledge makes the film all the more poignant. It was also one of the last of the great Westerns. Although the genre had seemed in reasonable health in the early seventies, it was to suffer, for various reasons, a sharp   decline in the second half of the decade and throughout the eighties. Perhaps the standard conventions of the genre had become so familiar that they seemed like clich√©s; perhaps the post-Vietnam generation had no time for films which often had as their themes honour, glory and courage. (It is notable that the patriotic war film underwent a similar decline at the same time). Certainly, the financial failure of `Heaven's Gate' made investors wary of backing westerns. Even Clint Eastwood, who had seemed to be the heir-apparent to Wayne's crown as King (or should that be Duke?) of the West, abandoned the genre for a time, although he was to return to it triumphantly with `Unforgiven' in the early nineties.Wayne's great strength as an actor was his ability to convey the tough but honourable man of action. Both these qualities are present in `The Shootist', but he was able to add further qualities, pathos and as sense of a less honourable past. Although Books is hard-bitten and irascible, he is also fundamentally decent, resorting to force only in self-defence. He can show pity- early in the film he spares the life of a villain who tries to rob him at gunpoint, even though he has the man at his mercy. Nevertheless, we are always well aware that he did not gain his fearsome reputation by a scrupulous observance of the Ten Commandments; although this is not an overtly religious film, the story of his last days can be seen as the story of his search for atonement as well as for dignity. In his last film, Wayne achieves one of his greatest performances; it is remarkable that he was not even nominated for an Oscar.The other performance that stands out is that of Ron Howard as Gillom. Howard, of course, is now best known as a director; if his acting career is remembered it is for his role that bland TV series `Happy Days'. Nevertheless, he was also capable of giving good contributions in films (`American Graffiti' is another example), and here he brings a touching youthful innocence to the part. There are also good contributions from James Stewart as the gentle, dignified doctor and from Lauren Bacall as Gillom's mother. (She has the unusual Christian name Bond, possibly symbolic of the close ties that grow between her and Books at the end of his life).`The Shootist' is a marvellous film, sombre and elegiac, and yet at the same time with a message of hope. A fitting end to Wayne's career. 9/10.

Wayne's character rides into town at the start of the film and visits James Stewart's pleasant Doc Hostetler, who tells him that he has terminal cancer and will die within two months. After this, Wayne goes and rents a room with widow Lauren Bacall, and begins to reflect on his situation, trying to figure a way to die retaining the dignity he has fought all his life to keep unscathed. The film is a particularly appropriate one for Wayne's last picture. The protagonist he plays is a man at the top of his profession with nowhere left to go. Any opponent who has ever fought him has died at the end of Books' barrel; but now, he is fighting an enemy he cannot hope to face and beat like a man. Whatever he does to fight the cancer, it will just take him anyway. And so, Books searches for a way to go down fighting and to die with dignity, not dying a slow crippling death in his bed. Books is a character that has many faults. He is a man who has killed thirty men and shows no remorse. As he puts it himself, `I never killed a man who didn't deserve it'. However, despite all his faults, he shows himself to a gentleman of the old school. He is like a knight in armour transplanted to the last days of the Wild West, trying hard to keep all the old values of a dignity and honour alive. He is a man who lives by a code which he believes in, and which he applies to others  `I won't be wronged, I won't be insulted, and I won't be laid a hand on. I don't do these things to other people, and I require the same from them.'There is no real villain in this film. Books, with all his flaws, is not a bad man. The real villains here are the ordinary people who are all around him in the city, willing to exploit him and use his fame, illness and even his death to further their own wealth. The whole town, from reporters to undertakers, are only too eager to exploit him, with only a few good people being an exception to this tragic rule.There is no mistaking that this is the Duke's final picture, and not anybody else's film. It is his persona and his charisma that carries and controls the film. The character of Books &#150; a rough, tough, but by no means bad, man &#150; is very much similar to that of Wayne's own and this film is essentially a vehicle allowing him to have a dramatic swansong befitting a star of his magnitude. That isn't to say, however, that the others involved with this don't pull their weight. Lauren Bacall delivers well up to her usual standard of acting, presenting a character both strong-spirited and tenderly gentle at once, something which she does extremely well. Ron Howard also acquits himself admirably as her son, turning in a performance which has the same strength and heart as that of his screen-mother Bacall. James Stewart turns in a powerful cameo, adding to the overall poignancy of the whole affair, and Harry Morgan turns in a repellent performance as the contemptible Marshal Thibado. Dirty Harry director Don Seigel directs with skill and ensures that the film remains poignant, but never sentimental. For a western, this film does not have a great deal of action, but such is the quality of acting, direction and scriptwriting, that this doesn't really matter. When the violence does erupt, however, it is occasionally graphic but always exciting. The film's climactic gunfight is a particular highlight and is one of the Duke's best shoot-outs.This is a powerful, entertaining and enjoyable film, regardless; however, it is further ennobled by it being the Duke's final performance. There is something curiously heart-warming about the whole affair, not least the fact that he is enabled to go out in such great style. This is a must for fans of the western genre, for fans of the Duke, or for anyone who just wants to see a well made, poignant film. Highly recommended. 8 "},{"Title":"Don Siegel crafted a milestone along the trail to the last sunset with The Shootist...","Date":"7 November 1999","Score":"77 out of 94 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":" The Shootist begins with clips from Wayne's previous pictures Hondo, Rio Bravo, El Dorado etc...Wayne portrays J.

It is a terrific end to a legendary career.After a brief prologue made up of film clips of Wayne in his career prime, we meet his cinematic alter ego, John Bernard Books, an aging gunfighter who rides into Carson City, Nevada in the early 1900's looking for Doc Hostetler (James Stewart), the old sawbones who once saved his life and apparently the only man he trusts.  It seems the old guy has prostate cancer and only a few weeks to live, and as Hostetler tells him, it will not be a pleasant death.  Books, with no where else to go, checks into Bond Rogers' (Lauren Bacall) boarding house to live out his final days in peace under the alias William Hickok.  When Bond's delinquent son Gillom (Ron Howard, in a nice change-of-pace performance and his last major film appearance before becoming a director) informs her of his true identity, she tries to throw him out but relents when she finds out his condition and agrees to help him die in peace. Unfortunately, things don't go as planned as everyone from the town mortician (John Carradine) to an old girlfriend (Sheree North) to a newspaper editor (Richard Lenz) try to take advantage of his situation and turn a fast buck.  And then there are several lowlifes (Richard Boone, Hugh O'Brien, Bill McKinney, etc.) who want to seal their reputations by taking him out.  Since it's obvious that no one will leave him alone in his final days, and since he grows fond (to put it mildly) of both Bond and Gillom and wishes them no harm, Books decides to go out in style and on his own terms, and to take a few scumbags along with him.The Shootist is one of those rare films that seems to have gotten better with age.  It wasn't particularly successful with critics or audiences at the time, as they were apparently put off by its leisurely pace and relative lack of action.  Typical of the reaction was a TV guide critic (who shall remain nameless), who once derided it and its stars as coming across as relics of the old West.  (Wasn't that the point?)  However, it is now pretty much considered a classic, and rightfully so, especially when viewed next to some of the lesser films of Wayne's 1970's period (Cahill, Rooster Cogburn, The Cowboys).  In fact, it is now hard to believe that Wayne was not nominated for an Oscar here, as Books is clearly one of the best performances of his career and definitely eclipses his extravagantly praised, Oscar-winning mugging in True Grit.  Indeed, The Shootist deserves to stand alongside Clint Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales and Oscar-winning Unforgiven as the last three great Westerns in cinema history.  Everything about it is immaculate--the sets, the costumes, the supporting cast (including Harry Morgan in a terrific cameo as an unsympathetic sheriff who tells Books, What I put on your grave won't pass for roses.), the script, and the chemistry between Wayne and Bacall, teaming up for the first time since Blood Alley.  And everything is held together by old pro director Donald Siegel who, aside from the late Hal Ashby, may very well be the most underappreciated director in cinema history.  But The Shootist is John Wayne's film all the way.  He is simply sensational, and BRAVE, since he apparently knew at the time his cancer was back and that this would probably be his last film.  It's not every film legend who gets to end his/her career on a high note, but Wayne did just that.  I just hope he knew it before his death barely three years later.  ****1/2 (out of *****)   "},{"Title":"You Really Should See This Film","Date":"20 October 2003","Score":"52 out of 62 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":"  John Wayne is an icon, and so many viewers seem to use his work as a referendum on the larger geo-political issues of our time.  I find that distasteful, as this isn't a political movie, and one that doesn't even have an oppressed indigenous person in it. This is a personal story of a man who has outlived his time, who is dying of cancer, and yet is determined to die with dignity. John Wayne really was dying of cancer when he made this movie... he gathered old friends around him--the widow of Humphrey Bogart, Jimmy Stewart, John Carradine, and addressed the topic of how legends die.  (Selling the rights for his corpse to be displayed by the undertaker for $50 cash in advance was a particularly interesting idea.)      I am viewing this film 27 years after it was made, and there is 'something' it had which is absent from movies today.  It is a film addressing mature themes for one thing, but it had a pacing, and made time for it's dialouge--it was never dull, never slow, but proceeded towards it's climax with the sort of gravitas you very rarely see in today's cinematic roller coaster rides, which have become little more than special effects vehicles.   There is another reason to see this film--it looks back at 1901 with a loving vision.  I was impressed with the historical accuracy in which it was filmed--it was impressive to see the town, from the horsedrawn street car and the Stanley Steamer, to little things like the flour dispenser in the kitchen. (Wondered where it was filmed--perhaps the old Old Tucson Studio before it burned down and was rebuilt to be a tourist attraction?)  Anyway, this was a lovingly crafted film--I don't know if Hollywood could still pull this off as real in 2003.         So, for big reasons and small, The Shootist is worth your time.  It is deeper than it looks.

Perhaps that style of heroism was all one needed to get by in the &#145;old west', but even then, death was not an easy thing to face (I bet most gunslingers and sheriffs' boots were filled with liquid just moments before they bit the dust). Finally, here is a film that looks at what courage is really made up of the ability to accept limitations, to accept change, to have humility, and to be able to say, `I'm afraid'.  The Duke is dying of cancer, in reality and within the plot of this film.  He is also a living myth in reality and within the plot of this film.  That he chose to play out his swan song as a human legend instead of as a mythic one, must have taken a lot of courage.  Imagine the Duke propped on a dainty red pillow upon his saddle!  Imagine him showing all the physical signs of the wear and tear that illness and age have bestowed on him.  Imagine him allowing us to hear the weakness of his infirm body slipping in the bathtub.  Imagine his groans of agony.  `Death is a very private thing', his character John Books says, but he is man enough to show us how to do it and do it with dignity, despite the fear.  Just imagine The Duke admitting that he's afraid of the dark!At the period in which this film is set, gunslingers &#150; or `shootists' &#150; were soon to go the way of the horse and buggy.  The queen (Victoria) had just died.  Electricity, modern plumbing, modern commerce, modern transportation, and creature comforts were beginning to take over (check out the electric ceiling fans and mosaic tiles in the saloon!).  Forward to &#145;real life'.  It is 1976.  One by one, the mythic legends created by dime novels and Hollywood movies are being demystified.  From Billy The Kid to Buffalo Bill, to Bonnie and Clyde, audiences have been shown for over decade how legends have always been manufactured.  There are some who may see this demystification as a negative thing, but when people start adoring soldiers, celebrities and gangsters as something more than human, it's time to set the record straight.  That's what all the best films of the seventies did.  They broke the myths but they did not break the spirit, for what they did was let US, not the supermen on the screen, become the heroes.  We could be afraid, old, young, ill, or weak, and we could feel pain and humiliation.  In the process of confronting our limitations we become stronger.  To be a stronger human being is to become civilized.  Like this film shows us, we CAN reject the gun and join civilization.  This film is John Wayne's gift to us.  He is enabling us to grow up, to look at the past with respect, but to face the future with responsibility.  His John Books is worth more to us than all his superheroes put together.  We're all gonna die, we're all afraid, and pain is very, very real.  It is in the process of surrendering to this fact with dignity and humility that we in a sense become immortal.  To try to live as a superman is to die a fool.  Only cowards (and very dangerous people) embrace myths over reality.  That dainty red pillow has made The Duke sit very tall in his saddle indeed!

Of course, the entire existence of the gunfighter is predicated on the inevitability that once you reach top there is always going to be someone looking to knock you off your pedestal.

Mainly because it is John Wayne's last, and it is packaged and delivered with that thought in mind. John Wayne was clearly anticipating his own real-life demise here, and on a very fundamental level that's what the movie is all about.But don't go in thinking that this is merely some kind of schmaltzy gimmick, a movie made just for the purpose of paying corny homage to John Wayne. It stands as a fine movie in its own right, well-written and well-acted. In fact, it may be John Wayne's overall finest performance (and you can put me down as one who considers the man to have been a talented actor), especially given that he was in considerable real-life discomfort and pain throughout filming. The story is chock-full of pearls of wisdom and memorable lines. It is also chock-full of symbolism on many levels, about history and the final days of the settling of the west, about movies and the end of the western genre in Hollywood, and, of course, about John Wayne personally, facing death, and of how he would be remembered --and exploited-- in death. All that and more is finely woven into the story, and few tricks were missed. As I said, well written.**SPOILER ALERT**One striking piece of symbolism was the exact manner of death of Wayne's character, the notorious gunslinger J.B. Books. In a prearranged a face-to-face simultaneous meeting with three of his worst enemies, a dying Books intended to fight them all at once to the death. Advised by his doctor that he was going to die a suffering death from the cancer that was eating his insides, Books presupposed that not even he could face down three these formidable foes at once and prevail. Books's own personal death with dignity. But then, against all odds, Books proceeds to out-duel and kill each, the message seeming to be that the even most difficult of life's tasks can be faced and conquered if done forthrightly and in earnest. Meanwhile, it was the sneaky bartender, symbolic of life's vices, that got him, shooting him in the back when he wasn't looking and not expecting it. And when you think about it, that's what took down John Wayne too. His vices. And while maybe he should have been expecting it, maybe he wasn't. Just like many of us aren't thinking about our mortality while we partake in the enjoyment of our vices.Another compelling aspect of the film is the stellar cast that was assembled. It reads like a veritable who's who. Lauren Bacall, Jimmy Stewart, Richard Boone, Hugh O'Brien, Harry Morgan, Scatman Crothers, John Carradine, along with several cameos, and others that weren't credited. The inclusion of Ron Howard for his pivotal role was a stroke of prophetic genius, intended or not. All of this talent sublimates itself neatly into the recesses of the story, where the real texture lies.This is a movie that I've seen at least a dozen times, and I never get tired of watching it. Every time I view it I see some little subtlety that I never noticed in previous viewings. Suffice it to say that it's a good film. I recommend it.

The parallels between Wayne's life at the time the film was made and the character(J.B.Brooks) he plays in the movie only add a poignant sadness. This sadness is part of the film, it never lets up. The first jolt of sadness comes when we see Wayne visiting with the town doctor, played by Jimmy Stewart. Wayne is diagnosed with an incurable cancer. This news seems to trouble Stewarts character as much as it does with Waynes. As both characters try to come to grips with this diagnosis, I was left wondering am I watching the work of two gifted actors play acting in a movie or am I watching two old friends bringing their reality into the movie?. Whatever the case, the scene is very moving. Also in the cast is Lauren Bacall as the recently widowed inn keeper. She helps keep Wayne's character fulfilled and feisty during his last days. Ironicly, this job was something she was familiar with, as she did this in real life with her late husband Humphrey Bogart. There are many good performances by the rest of the cast. But it is the circumstances under which they were filmed for Wayne, that make his a truly unbelievable performance. There are two of his scenes that stand out for me 1) Listening to John Wayne and Scatman Crothers haggle over the selling price of Wayne's horse. Yeah, it might not sound like much here in print, but that's just a testimony of how well these two actors pull that scene off. Just great. 2) Seeing John Wayne enter the saloon with a purpose for the last time. Truly one of the most bone chilling cinematic moments of all time.If you love John Wayne then I'm certain that you love this film already. If you can take or leave John Wayne, you might at least like this film. But if you don't care for Wayne or for that matter, if you don't like westerns, you'll probably still like this film.

It's a terminal cancer all right and it's going to be rough final trip. News of Queen Victoria's dying is in the papers the day Wayne arrives in town. He admires the way she left the mortal coil and he resolves in his own mind a plan to go out the same way.Wayne put a great cast together for The Shootist, some of them friends and colleagues he worked with over the years like James Stewart, Lauren Bacall, John Carradine, Harry Morgan, Hugh O'Brian and Richard Boone. If you read Lauren Bacall's memoirs you will be touched at the affection she felt for John Wayne, though their politics were light years apart. James Stewart was quoted as saying he was just honored to be in this film with the Duke.One of John Wayne's best acted scenes ever in any of his films is with Sheree North who plays a former girl friend. She visits him and proposes marriage, but a little later it's learned that she's in cahoots with a 19th century tabloid writer Rick Lenz who wants to exploit his legend in a tell all memoir. To quote the Bard it was the unkindest cut of all. I was more emotionally moved by that scene than with the final gunfight.Which in itself is something. Wayne challenges local tough Bill McKinney, old enemy Richard Boone, and faro dealer and dead shot Hugh O'Brian to meet him. What happens you have to see the film for, but let's say that Wayne meets the dignified and courageous end we would expect of him. In the three years left to him on earth it was rumored that John Wayne was interested in a few film projects, like maybe he was being saved for something even better.

What I really admire about this film is it's cast, who knew that it was probably going to be John Wayne's last film. They brought out the best for this film.Let's look at the director, Don Siegel, a really top notch director of action films that are more than action films, like Dirty Harry and Escape from Alcatraz. Mr. Siegel seems to really have the talent to blend a story with action.Let's look at the leads. John Wayne - what can you say the man always will be known as an icon. A true professional - he had little patience with actors who did not show up on time and did not know their lines. Look at the standing ovation he got for his Best Actor Oscar for True Grit. Hollywood loved this guy! Lauren Bacall - awesome, as always. She always delivers in any part. She's such a reliable, remarkable actress. She's a direct link to another era of Hollywood, when stars weren't jockeying for position at the Sundance Film Festival or showing up in Us Magazine. Bacall shows up prepared for a role and she gets the job done. And done well. Lauren, you're a great actress and great in this film! Bogie would be proud.

Even stranger was it because the character he plays is dying of cancer just like John Wayne himself was at the moment. It gave the movie a deeper meaning and made some of the scene's more emotional.The story is told in a absolutely fantastic way. The story is slow but the mixture of good old western style and drama makes the movie always interesting to watch. The movie had so many deeper meanings. The movie is set in 1901, the time when the time of the good old west was almost at its end. Only thing that stands in between of the good old west and modern times are characters such as John Bernard Books (John Wayne), an old gunslinger from the good old days. His character is coping with his inevitable coming death but also coping with the fact that the good old days of gunfights at the O.K. Corral and saloons are over for good. He basically is the only remaining person still alive from the good old days with a reputation, so when he dies the old west dies with him. In a way this also shows some parallels with Wayne's death, when he died a piece of the genre Western died with him as well.Beside 'The Duke' the movie also has some fine other great actors such as Lauren Bacall, James Stewart (also his last Western as an actor, he however later still provided one of the voices for his final movie An American Tail Fievel Goes West.), Scatman Crothers and John Carradine. Still it was kind of an odd sight to see John Wayne and Ron Howard acting in scene's together. I don't know for some reason it just felt unreal.The movie also has a fine and a bit of underrated musical score from composer Elmer Bernstein. The movie itself is also kind of underrated, not in terms of the rating it gets but in terms of how well known it is to the general public. This is really a movie that deserves to be seen by more, if only also because of the fact that its Wayne's last role before his death in 1979. Don Siegel movie's are often underrated for some reason, he was a great director that made some real classics but yet he never won any big awards and he is probably only known to the general public for making Dirty Harry.Don't watch this movie expecting spectacular gunfight and other Western clich√©s. Yes there is some shooting in this movie but really, this movie is more of a drama than a Western. Still fans of the Western genre will also not be disappointed because of the atmosphere and also mainly just simply because of Wayne's character.An extremely worthy last movie for 'movie-legend' John Wayne.9/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Great John Wayne film","Date":"28 January 2003","Score":"7 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":" Is there any other kind of film that John Wayne worked in that wasn't great?

The acting in this film is really good by Wayne, but also by the superb supporting cast consisting of Richard Boone, Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard and Hugh O'Brian. Very few films have so many big names in them! Everyone wanted to be in a film with John Wayne. The story's been covered by other commenters so I'll not bore you with another synopsis.

This gives several scenes a real lump-in-the-throat quality, such as when Wayne tells Lauren Bacall I'm a dying man afraid of the dark.But even when viewed without that knowledge, The Shootist is a thoughtful, sad and very well acted film.  Although I've seen only a handful of Wayne's 200-plus movies, it's hard for me to believe that he ever turned in a better performance than he did here.  His portrayal of a terminally ill man wanting to end his life on his own terms is moving and totally convincing.  The supporting cast is also outstanding, and Wayne has several great scenes with actors like Jimmy Stewart, Lauren Bacall, Ron Howard and even Scatman Crothers. I found Harry Morgan, whom I usually like, to be a bit cartoonish as the marshall who was anxious to see Wayne's character die as quickly as possible, but that's a minor quibble.Since the movie takes place in 1901, there are naturally references to the end of the old west and the coming of a new age, and how the time of gunfighters like Wayne's character have come to an end.  Again, it is difficult to view these scenes without thinking of the twilight of Wayne's career and the declining popularity of western films, just as you can't help but connect the plight of his character in this film with his own death from cancer a few years later.It's hard to imagine that any other significant actor ever made a more appropriate and moving farewell film.  You don't need to be a fan of westerns, or even a fan of John Wayne, to appreciate The Shootist.

He died of cancer shortly after its release. Ironic, then, that his character in the movie is a shootist dying of cancer out west in 1901. His doctor (James Stewart) gives him a short period of time to live. He decides to take an easier route, and returns to his old stomping grounds in order to find a quick and painless death.Along the way he meets The Son (Ron Howard in one of his early roles), and a various assortment of other characters, in his search for suicide.Don Siegel (Dirty Harry) has always been one of my favorite directors -- he's made some truly terrific films in his career. The Shootist is one of his best. The last thing we expect in a John Wayne film is a dying, frail, pessimistic human being. We get it.Books, the titular shootist, is arguably Wayne's deepest character he would ever play; and his story is one of the most compelling of Wayne's entire career. The acting is top-notch, the direction low-key, subtle, and effective. It's hard-edged, just like Dirty Harry (1971) bloody, violent, a bit over-the-top (if it were made in Hollywood today it would probably look a lot like Kill Bill).Yet the film's best moments are those involving its character, Books, and his strange quest for death. This movie strikes chords on many different levels. It's a really good film, one of the best of the 1970s, one of Don Siegel's best, and one of John Wayne's best, too.And that's saying quite a lot.

The movie is just damn unusual, but given the circumstances -- the final performance by one of the most famous actors (one of the most famous Americans, really) in all history -- a truly unique effort was required. Wayne had already had a lung removed before the movie was shot, and during the shoot was having heart trouble. It was clear that the man didn't have too much longer to go (though he surprised everyone by sticking it out for 3 more torturous years), so the director and the writers reshaped the well-regarded old pulp Western novel on which the story is based to fit the living legend like a glove. The results are fairly glorious, but keep the slight caveat in mind that it's a one-man show, here.And what a man! Recall that Wayne had once befriended Wyatt Earp (yes, THAT Wyatt Earp) on the back-lot of MGM Studios back in the late Twenties. I'm not sure if that really means anything, except for the notion that if Wayne merited the opprobrium of the Achilles of the Wild West, then Wayne himself must have been infused with a mythic touch as well. In many ways, this sense is made clearer in his final film than in any of his others. Despite how obviously unwell he is, there's something lordly, almost god-like, about his presence here. And, for once, and despite the lordliness, the Duke is entirely lovable. Gone is the reactionary, crotchety posturing of such late-career films as *The Green Berets* and *True Grit*. In *The Shootist*, the actor is facing much more compelling circumstances that changing political and social attitudes. Impending mortality apparently made him serene enough about the small stuff that he could take the post-modern Seventies head-on, climbing aboard the revisionist-Western bandwagon with absolutely no difficulty.And this IS a post-modern Western, despite the cozy late-Victorian interiors and Wayne standing in for all the Old-Fashioned Values. One can only shake one's head in disbelief when Wayne says things like, A man should be able to die privately -- our knowledge of the actor's condition makes a meta-fictive mockery of the dialog. On the other hand, the well-earned sentimentality plays a harmonious chord with the post-modern cinematic ideas about the Old West. Don Siegel directed this movie -- a post-modern enough guy, I suppose, but even so, not the most intuitive choice for this relatively non-violent project, though there are occasional splashes of Peckinpahian bright-orange blood, and Siegel DOES evince his usual editorial brilliance with the exciting final shootout in the bar. Speaking of the climax, its ambiguity is startling Wayne, after dispatching his final foes, ends up shot in the back by a bar-keep. And what final screen image of John Wayne does Siegel give us? Wayne dead on his back in the bar, covered in a blanket, isolated in death, with ironic commentary provided by a gilded stand, in the shape of an eagle, for a potted plant standing a few feet behind the corpse. Preceding this, Ron Howard's character has tossed away the pistol he used to exact revenge on the bar-keep. Wayne nods in philosophical assent just before he dies. What does this mean, anyway? -- a repudiation of the actor's own legend? Had Wayne become a peacenik? Who knows. The ambiguities, in any case, are strange and marvelous. Art, in other words.Just a quick note on the more mundane aspects. The production design is top-notch. Filmed in Carson City, NV, the scouts clearly noted that particular town's unsullied architecture -- Carson is a place that has stayed firmly rooted in its aesthetic origins. There are many subtle touches, such as when the bar-keep has to turn on the ceiling fan -- powered by a rotary leather belt -- with a long stick that resembles a pool cue with a small wrench at the tip. The multifarious and ungainly-looking telegraph poles are appropriate, as are the tremulous horseless carriages from circa 1901. All of which, of course, underscores the idea that Wayne's character is way out-of-date, an absurd final remnant of a vanished breed. But magnificent for all that, regardless. Finally, several other Golden Age heroes -- Lauren Bacall, James Stewart, and even John Carradine (who had played Wayne's rival in *Stagecoach* almost 40 years prior) -- provide loving support, even if their roles aren't characters as such, instead showing up as mere satellites that orbit around the Duke.*The Shootist* belongs in that special, and very small, group of films -- like Huston's *The Misfits* -- that allow us to pay our respects to performers who not only portray what is best and worst in our own selves, but indeed shape our entire popular culture. A must-own if you care about the movies. 8 stars out of 10.

With bad medical advice he returns to his home town to get a second option from doctor and trusted friend Dr Hostetler. Sadly the second opinion is the same as the first &#150; inoperable cancer. Not knowing how long he has left, Books settles on facing death the best he can and moves into a spare room in Mrs Bond Rogers' home where he intends to slowly and quietly die. However with his name nothing is quiet and he is quickly paying the price for the life he has lived up till this point.Opening with clips from his earlier movies we join Wayne as Books as he ends his life. He wants peace and quiet but the previous lifetime he has led means that this is denied him; essentially, in between gun fights we have regret, hero worship and missed opportunities all mulled over at a pace that is rather slow but still quite engaging. In regards narrative it is simple because it relies heavily on the character of Books and on the legend that is Wayne. Both of these things come though although perhaps not as well as they could have done. Specifically I wanted more from the character of Books &#150; it is perhaps an unfair comparison but I thought Unforgiven did much better with a similar character. It still does enough though, and Books is an amiable character that I was able to care for and get to know (albeit not as much as I would have liked). Siegel directs with a patient hand, treating the genre and the characters with an easy respect and doing as well with the reflective moments as he does with the action.Those who fill message boards with complaints that Wayne was just a simple performer with a few catchphrases and a swagger will find that this film is yet another reason to perhaps reconsider because he is strong here. Again I would have liked more darkness in him but the way he does it here does justice to his career, his characters and the aspect of the western genre that he is most famous for. Bacall is good opposite him (although has been better in other films naturally) and she adds to the feeling of reflection. Howard is OK but his character is too obvious and he doesn't convince as a real person. Support from people like Boone, Crothers, Carradine and others is roundly good but it is Wayne's film and he fits it pretty well and gives a performance that, although not perfect, will certainly please those familiar with him.Overall this is not a brilliant film but it is a perfectly good one that has a slow and reflective pace. I would have liked more depth and dark but it is serviceable enough and serves as a good way for Wayne to bow out without sentimentality or showboating. Not to everyone's tastes I'll wager but a fine film that is worth seeing.

Wayne is quite simply perfect (of course he was also dying while the film was being made, which adds another level of poinancy to the story).  He plays a character who has lead a shady life at best, but at the end of it, he wants to avoid dying in bed, but he also wants to avoid inspiring other people to follow in his footsteps (particularly the young boy played by Ron Howard).  This odd duality is played out perfectly by Wayne (who has played such characters before, such as The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence).There are NO flaws in this film, it is simply perfect cinema.  Anyone who loves film NEEDS to see this one at least once.  Also, it has a tendency to recharge the batteries of those who have been overwhelmed by the violence in contemporary cinema.

An unusual focus for an American film, to say the least.Finally, I have to say a word for Richard Boone's performance it's amazing. In a few words and bizarre gestures, he creates a character who has lived for revenge for years, and been terribly twisted by it, while remaining of this world enough to advance to motor cars --- and be hilarious at the same time!

Not only was this his greatest acting achievement (surpassing The Cowboys in which he was also very, very good) it is also one of the best films ever produced in the Western genre. This movie benefitted from an excellent script and superb casting, but was brought to perfection by the sterling performances of three great stars, Wayne, Bacall and Stewart.Wayne's interactions with Stewart, Bacall and Howard are moving and powerful. The depth of character in Books is set in contrast to the shallowness and opportunism of others, particularly Dobkins and Serepta, but also Cobb. Becoming, briefly, the father figure needed by Gillom, Books more than makes up in his last week of life for the havoc he brought to society in his earlier life (as viewed by Mrs. Rogers). Of course, part of the tension in the plot is created by the different evaluations Books and Rogers would assign to Books' life. Both stand in contrast to the view of that life held by Gillom and Moses.Back in 1969, the Academy, realizing it had never appropriately honored John Wayne and fearful that time was running out to do so, gave him Best Actor for one of his weaker performances and poorer scripts. It is unfortunate his colleagues did not make up for that error by repeating the honor for what was truly a great performance in The Shootist. Nonetheless, the proof of the pudding is still in the eating, and the availability of The Shootist on tape and (hopefully) DVD will allow us to keep eating this one over and over.John Wayne fans should be encouraging their non-Wayne-fan friends to see this movie.

Director Don Siegel was not very well known for having an interesting visual style, but for being able to tell an interesting story plainly; still, I was surprised, on viewing this again recently, at how neatly controlled his composition is. This is an excellent example of keeping the camera out of the way of the audience's interest in the story, and still coming up with interesting things to do with it.The acting is all top-notch, with Wayne's performance establishing both the options and limitations for all the other actors, who recognize that this is exactly as it should be. The story doesn't give Wayne's Books any opportunity to sit around mulling things over; there's no soliloquy here. Books is an honorable man and a plain man, who became famous for having a particularly unlikeable knack for shooting people; he did his job well because he was paid to do so. If he hadn't gotten paid, he probably would have hung up his guns and gone and done something else.Trying to get the professionalism of the professional gunman across to an audience is a thankless and nearly impossible task - if Chow Yun fat overacts a bit in The Killer, it's because he knows that playing the hit-man too coolly would make him out to be a sociopath, which is exactly the impression director Woo wanted to avoid.Here Wayne pulls it off without a sweat. We feel compassion for the man because his job never forced him to lose his humanity; and we can guess that when jobs came along that threatened to do so, he refused to take them on.Which leaves us with a man, not a gunman. And he knows this, and he knows that his legend is largely fabricated by the fears and envies others have.It's a rich film with a considerable depth that is camouflaged with traditional cowboy movie trappings.

With the departure of John Wayne, as with this movie, we saw the end of an era, one not likely to ever be recaptured. In this movie, he goes out with dignity and class. And with that, we bid him a fond farewell.

Only one man could have played J.B. Books -- the man who was living much as the character was living, that is dying of cancer. That actor was none other than John Wayne. How much of the character is John Wayne playing himself? One can never know. It's hard to imagine any other actor in the role.John Wayne plays J.B. Books, one of the last gun-slinging lawmen of an era, a dying man representing a dying world the uncivil, uncouth, semi-literate Wild West in 1901. He has come from Colorado to Carson City to get medical help with a cancer more advanced than anyone, including Doctor Hostetler (Jimmy Stewart) can do anything about other than gut (Books) like a fish or let him live as tolerably as possible on morphine. The bad guys didn't all get away; there are a few left in Carson City. Moreover, a young Gillom Rogers (Ron Howard) has developed a troublesome fascination with the legendary Old West that his mother Bond (Lauren Bacall) wants him to lose. Books may be just the thing to turn Gillom toward a more wholesome life (the question is resolved at the end).There is one last showdown, and it is brilliant; it must be seen as a convincing and heroic close to John Wayne's acting career. The obsolescence of Books' world is established in the ways in which Books gets to the final scene (a trolley car); one of the bad guys uses a horseless carriage instead of the horse that one expects in a Western -- but the story is set in 1901, the century in which the Wild West became a legend and no longer a reality.All that keeps this Western from being one of the very best (with -High Noon-, -Shane-, and -Stagecoach-) is the corny start in which Books gives a hokey philosophy, an anachronistic expression of existentialism, in which he announces that he never killed a man who didn't deserve it and demonstrates the principle by killing an outlaw who tries to rob him. That little section detracts from the rest of the movie, and should have been left out; it reduces my rating from a '9' to an '8'. Otherwise, the movie is wholly satisfying even for someone who doesn't especially like westerns.The acting is superb in no small measure due to the will-suited cast. All is resolved in the end.

J.B. Books, the legendary 'shootist', has come here to die.John Wayne had come close to death from cancer in 1963.  One of his lungs was removed on that occasion, but it seemed as though he had fully recovered and 'had it licked', as he put it.  However, the disease was only in remission, and when it became clear in the mid 1970's that the conditional was probably terminal, Wayne chose this film as his way of saying his personal farewell to the movies.Wayne's character, John Bernard Books, is suffering from internal cancer and this is confirmed for him by Carson's Doc Hostetler, played with gentle dignity by James Stewart.  The gunman receives a bottle of laudanum to swig whenever the pain gets intense, and some sound advice - the death he is likely to suffer from the cancer will be extremely unpleasant, and he might wish to choose another way to go.Books' birthday falls on January 29, and he resolves to die on that day.  He has a bloody account to settle with three bad men, so he spends his final week of life settling his affairs and preparing for the last showdown.Befriending his landlady Mrs. Rogers (Lauren Bacall) and her son Gillom (Ron Howard), Books staves off loneliness in this 'false spring' of his final days.  It is winter in the Rockies, and the film has a sad, sombre mood.  You plain plumb outlived your time, Books is told, and he does not demur.  It is as if he is leaving his own world behind as he rides in as a lone horseman through the sage, with the mountains behind him, to a city where automobiles and streetcars clog the roads and telegraph wires hum overhead.In a little contretemps with the man from the creamery, Books is framed at an upward angle through the door of the cart, emphasising his giant stature in the saddle.  I won't be wronged, I won't be insulted and I won't be laid a hand on.  I don't do these things to other people and I require the same of them.  This is the code by which Books has lived, and by which he has elected to die.Siegel's direction is sensitive, fitting harmoniously into the Wayne canon whilst standing alone as a distinct work in its own right.  The brief biography of J.B. Books which opens the movie, to a voice-over by Ron Howard's character Gillom, quarries the half-century of Wayne's own career in westerns to present an 'archive' of Books' exploits.  A literate script gives Wayne an opportunity to act, as his character displays the emotions of a dying man - anger, regret and stoicism.It is worth watching the film for the set alone.  Horsedrawn streetcars run on rails and the saloon is a late Victorian gem, with its long bar and squeaky overhead fan.  The houses are through-built, so that we can follow Books and Doc Hostetler by means of a handheld camera as they leave the surgery office and walk through the hallway and onto the street. The Rogers house in particular is an elaborately-conceived set in which the various rooms display a convincing spatial relationship.John Carradine, as the undertaker Beckum, and Harry Morgan as Sheriff Thibido, are other veteran stars who turn in  delightful cameo performances. Richard Boone, a longtime collaborator in Wayne's projects, makes a terrific villain.When Wayne enters the saloon at the end, and approaches the bar with that so-familiar lope, we know that a great action climax is approaching. In this, his last round-up, the Duke doesn't let us down.

Wayne is backed up in his swansong by Lauren Bacall (Bond Rogers), James Stewart (Doc Hostelter) and an engagingly important Ron Howard (Gillom Rogers).

He was dying of cancer at the time, and he plays a man who is dying of cancer. Why should anyone even have to try? Yet John Wayne, class act that he is, gives a remarkable performance enriched with deep pathos and humanity, far more than anyone could expect from such an otherwise mediocre film. Damn every claim that Wayne was not a great actor; the proof of the opposite can be found far and wide in the man's filmography, and one of the best examples can be found in The Shootist. After Wayne, James Stewart gives a good supporting performance as his doctor. Harry Morgan is the only actor in the film who really impresses besides its star. Ron Howard I've always found difficult to take seriously, what with all his television roles and his mostly mediocre and overrated directorial career. But he's pretty good here, and he especially has a good final scene. Lauren Bacall is the low point in the film. She was never a good actress, let's face it. Well, she did decently in To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, but all the other roles I've seen of hers were painfully dull. She's particularly awful here. It's pretty sad when you're totally outclassed by Ron Howard. And then she has to act opposite Wayne giving his all? Truly, truly embarrassing. I don't really want to bitch out Don Siegel, who surely made some fine films in his day. But his direction here is painfully mediocre. Any hour-long episode of any television Western has much more talent behind it. He may not have been a hack director, but it sure feels like a hack director was standing behind the camera during the movie's filming. The screenplay is poorly constructed, but it has some rather good dialogue, most of it belonging to Wayne. I like Elmer Bernstein's score, too, most of the time. The music over the closing credits is particularly good.

He realized he wasn't getting any younger, and his health was declining, but he never intended this to be his last movie.

Apparently Wayne had more filmed lined up before his death three years later but none of them ever came to be and that's probably a good thing because THE SHOOTIST really sends the legend out on a very high note. I say this because so many legends end their careers with bad or at best mediocre movies but at least the biggest movie star in the history of cinema got to go out on top. A lot of the greatness here has to go to Wayne who is simply wonderful in the role of the dying man. I think Wayne's heartfelt performance here also adds to the myth that he knew he was dying because you really do feel as if you're watching someone on their final days. It's quite a tender performance but that toughness is still there and believable. The supporting players all fit their roles nicely and there's no question it's very nice seeing Wayne act with them one final time. Director Don Siegel does a very good job at keeping the film moving in between the action scenes and he does a very nice job with the more quiet moments. THE SHOOTIST is also a throwback to the Westerns that Wayne was making earlier in his career but there's no doubt that the actor got to go out on top, which is certainly fitting.

When word of his presence gets out plenty of local men think they can take him in a gunfight; something he decides might be better than a slow death from cancer.I'm surprised this isn't amongst the better known of John Wayne's westerns; his inevitable demise mirrors the passing of the old west; he may have ridden into town but there are cars, telephones and electricity there; the west in no longer the wild place it was only a few years before. There is added poignancy due to the fact that Wayne was also dying and this would be his last film. As with all his films he played the same basic character but that is no bad thing as he played that character so well. He is ably supported by Lauren Bacall and Ron Howard as his landlady and her son and in smaller parts James Stewart and Harry Morgan are great as the Doctor and the city's marshal.

Directed by Don Siegel.It was 1976, John Wayne was almost seventy, he just finished making the film Rooster Cogburn (an ill-fated sequel to True Grit Co-starring Katherine Hepburn) Wayne obviously knew that his days as a big actor could possibly be numbered, and he couldn't live forever (no one could). That being said with the possibility of death Wayne was aware that he needed to end his career on a high note (like so many actors have attempted and failed at doing), being ever closer to possibility of death, Wayne chose the right role in the Shootist. The producers of this film feared that John Wayne would not be able to film very well because of his health, so they wanted George C. Scott, but Wayne campaigned for the role and he got it. Among other things John Wayne was involved in the casting decisions of Lauren Bacall, James Stewart, Richard Boone, and John Carradine (it was at his suggestion that those actors be casted in the film).The films begins with a montage featuring older John Wayne film (a nice touch might I add). It flashes to 1901. The story concerns a man named JB (John Bernard) Brooks a legendary Shootist (a gunfighter more or less). Brooks is in town visiting his friend E.W. Doc Hosteler (played by acting legend James Stewart). He is informed by the Hosteler that he is dying of cancer. Brooks decides to rent a room from Bond Rodgers a widow (played by Lauren Bacall) and her son Gillom (Ron Howard) in order to spend his days in peace. All the while this is happening, former rivals are forcing him to come out, resulting in a who-rah in a bar that features a surprising ending (especially one for a John Wayne film).As films go the Shootist is very nice. The direction is perfect (Director Don Siegel was adapt at doing these kinds of things having perfected them with Clint Eastwood movies such as Coogan's Buff and Dirty Harry). The script is cut cleaned, and the performances while most of them very underutilized are well done. It's always terrific to James Stewart on screen and he fits the role of the Doc perfect, even though you can clearly tell it's James Stewart. Richard Boone is great in the role as one of Brooks rivals, giving a punchable performance. Ron Howard is fine for what he's got (but I admit I was never a big fan of him as an actor), next to Wayne Ron Howard has to carry the most of this film as he has a large amount of screen-time. Despite having her name before the title, Lauren Bacall doesn't have a huge amount of screen-time and her character is not very well developed, but it's still fun to see her on screen.In a sense this film could very well be viewed as being based off John Wayne's final days (however the Duke had been proposed to have been cancer free around this time, it wasn't until January 1979 that they discovered that he still had the disease). Either way John Wayne would not act in another film during the last 3 years of his life after making this one (despite several attempts to pull him out of retirement).Swan song or not, the Shootist works both way as a western and as a final ho-rah. It's splendid film, and has a huge recommendation from me.10/10.

This movie is an example of John Wayne at the best of his acting capabilities. He manages to emotionally move even the toughest of souls, even making one tear up at the heart-wrenching end. So, The Shootist is just an all around great movie.

Lauren Bacall, James Stewart, Harry Morgan, John Carradine, Richard Boone, Hugh O'Brian, William McKinney, Scatman Crothers, Sheree North and Ron Howard round out the cast perfectly. A film truly worthy of your personal collection. A true classic!

Can't think of one. If the movie was not constructed with that in mind, it might as well have been. It's not a perfect movie &#150; the gunfight at the end seems anticlimactic on some level and the motivations of the antagonists are not entirely clear. The music did not always make sense. I might have cast someone other the Ron Howard as well. Not fair to him, but I kept thinking Opie or Richie. The passing years, however, have muted this reaction and I can better accept him in the role. Minor quibbles.What this movie does have, however, is John Wayne. Who else could have filled to role. And yes he could act. It really seemed like what you would expect from someone who was having to reconcile the end of his era (the old West) and the end of his life. He lived his life in an unorthodox but courageous fashion - one that did not fit the sensibilities of good folk &#150; and he faces his death the same way. On his terms. Nuance may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of John Wayne's acting, but it's there. It's always been there. Listen to the weariness in his voice; the struggling movement as the pain takes hold. Watch the subtle expressions on his face. One of my favorite little exchanges is when Lauren Bacall tells Ron Howard to do some particular chore as she is about to take a ride with John Wayne. Howard starts with typical teenage whining, but a quick glance from Wayne gives an instant attitude adjustment. It happens so quickly, but it fits so perfectly. Yep, John Wayne could act. It is a treat to see Bacall, Stewart and some other Hollywood legends and stalwarts in the same film, and see them interact with John Wayne. But it's Wayne's film. He dominates the screen as he always did, all the more poignant because we know this is the last time we get to see him do it. As with the Shootist, he is gone, and we shall not see his like again.

I finally have seen a John Wayne movie where he's at his most vulnerable. His character Books,if younger,would be larger than life. If John Wayne ever deserved an Academy Award,they should have given it too him for The Shootist. It's very sobering to see him play this part.Much like Tuesday's With Morrie,we're dealing with an unpleasant,depressing subject. John Wayne though,is playing out his reality for all to see. He looks like he's been through it all and in 1976,he had been for nearly 50 years and almost 60 westerns. The rest of the cast does a great job,Ron Howard is surprising in his role (not because he actually curses a few times) but that he can go toe to toe with Wayne and Lauren Bacall and stand out just as much as they do. Bacall,is always good and this is no exception. Some think playing this kind of role is easy but one has to take into account that any good Hollywood actor has to avoid walking through their part and she certainly does not.There's not a lot of action but what there is of it,is pure John Wayne and classic western-style danger. (I hate the term shoot-'em up's,because it lessens the value of human life,despite the gunfights being staged.) In all,if you want a western that actually has more to it than the gunfights and is not just John Wayne's final film but almost a testament to the man's character,then buy or rent The Shootist. It's the best final film of any actor I've ever seen or that you may.

For his range, one should go to THE SEARCHERS, THE SANDS OF IWO JIMA, RED RIVER and the three I have mentioned in the course of these comments. The opening of THE SHOOTIST is a treat for Wayne fans with its collage of scenes from his earlier films. I identified RED RIVER, RIO BRAVO and EL DORADO,and a few others. The follow up is fine, with the aged gunfighter an object of pity and contempt for some, while some view him with awe.The scene where Wayne moves off the horse-drawn tram after bidding goodbye to the little girl was moving.

The Shootist, Wayne's final film, is a wonderful showcase for this iconic actor. As a dying gunfighter, Wayne is forced to play a downbeat and more introspective character than we are used to from him. Still a dangerous man when threatened, his J.B. Books character is a man who has come to terms with his past. He knows the kind of man he is, and he knows his way of life is over. All he is looking to do is bow out with dignity. But any man who crosses him will not likely be around long to regret it, either.The film begins with Wayne as we knew him best. Outgunning a highwayman and leaving him for dead. Soon, the Duke finds himself in Carson City, Nevada in the doctor's office of Jimmy Stewart. Stewart confirms what another doctor had already told Wayne. He will soon be dead from cancer. Worse than that, his final days will be filled with agonizing pain, followed by loss of facilities. All Stewart can do is give him something for the pain and his advice. His J.B. Books character is said to be a brave man. Stewart suggests he find the courage to end things before the symptoms become too crippling. Wayne thanks the doc, and checks himself into a boarding house where he plans to live out his final days. The house is run by a prim and proper widower played by Lauren Bacall. Once she finds out her new boarder is an infamous gunman, she wants him out. Her son, played by Ron Howard, is starstruck by Wayne. He wants Wayne to teach him what he knows. Once word gets out that this legendary gunfighter is in town, there are those who look to either take him out or make a profit off him somehow. After about a week, the old gunfighter seems to have made peace with those around him that he cares about. But a man like this can only go out one way....Simply put, the film is excellent. What a fitting end to the career of such a wonderfully talented man as John Wayne. His performance will bring out the emotions of even those who claim not to be his fans. His face is able to project the confused solemnity that a person facing certain death must sense. Despite the weight of his reputation, and his still being able to wield those deadly pistols, he is a man who will very soon lie beneath the earth. And there is nothing he can do about it. And the world he is about to leave behind is changing drastically. The cattle culture of the old west was about gone. It is 1901. Even Carson City's street cars would be powered by electricity within a year, the town marshal boasts. One of the desperadoes Wayne faces in the final shootout even pulls up to the saloon in a car! Yes! It had to be one of the earliest models of car ever made. And once the shooting stops, and the matter at hand is resolved, it really feels like you as the viewer have lost a member of your family. Wayne himself would be gone within three years after the film was made. But long live the Duke! The film is worth 9 stars plus the extra star for the Scatman Cruthers bonus that I always award.

When I was younger, I thought THE SHOOTIST was something thrown together for a bunch of aging actors at the end of their careers. Boy, was I wrong! I've seen the film several times over the years and appreciate how special it is more and more.Being more ignorant in my younger days, I didn't realize the concepts of 'plot' or 'direction'. Now that I am more familiar with Don Siegel's directorial style, I see how well it works in this film. Siegel directed DIRTY HARRY, and there are obvious comparisons in the storytelling. THE SHOOTIST has the lone strong central heroic character who puts utter fear in the hearts of his opponents, who is flawed in many ways, but at his core, is perhaps the most righteous of all men because he has a moral code. The other common Siegel element that THE SHOOTIST has in common with DIRTY HARRY is suspense. There are several edge-of-your-seat moments, appropriately timed, spaced, and placed, just enough to keep the viewer interested but not overdone just for the sake of violence. THE SHOOTIST also gives you a real sense of a specific time and place in the dying Old West moving into the 20th centurty and completely draws you into this world. A testament to a great filmmaker.Wayne's character John Bernard J.B. Books sums up all that was so great about Wayne himself macho, tough, unflappable, old-school, with doses of tenderness and sentimentality. It starts out with several scenes of a young John Wayne (in his old Westerns of the 30s, 40s, and 50s). These shots are supposed to be of the young Books and they actually work well. You get the sense that it is Books and not just old Wayne footage. A wanderer tries to rob the aging Books, but Books stops him by wounding him. Books arrives in Carson City and goes to see the town doctor E.W. Hostetler, an old acquaintance (played by the legendary James Stewart). It was great watching these 2 film heroes together one last time. Doc confirms to Books what other doctors have told him that he has inoperable tumor and that he does not have long to live. So Books decides to settle down for his last days in town.Books rents a room, under a fake name, at the town boarding house of Bond Rogers (played by Lauren Bacall in a dignified, classy performance). Mrs. Roger's has a son, Gillom (played by young Ron Howard in a fine performance). Howard has that youthful exuberance that he displayed on The Andy Griffith show, but he makes you completely forget about Opie here. He plays a more wild, starry-eyed teenager which is appropriate since he wasn't far removed from being one when this film was made.Books and Gillom have an uneasy first meeting b/c Gillom thinks he's just some doddering old-timer, but when he learns that he is the famous J.B. Books, he immediately becomes awestruck and a huge fan. Books even shows him how to draw a gun and shoot with accuracy, a portent of things to come later. Books also has an admirer in the town stablekeeper Moses Brown (played by Scatman Crothers in an extremely likable performance). Books sells his horse to Moses and this lighthearted scene where they make the deal always makes me smile.But Mrs. Rogers doesn't want a killer in her home, until she finds out he is dying. The scene when Books tells Mrs. Rogers that he is dying may be my favorite moment of the film. It is a very heartbreaking scene; you can see Mrs. Rogers almost break into tears, but restrain herself at the last minute.Meanwhile, the other boarders don't like staying with a killer and leave Books as the only renter. Also, the town marshal (played by Harry Morgan in a funny performance) wants Books to leave, but when he finds out he's dying he lets him stay. He's actually glad Books is dying b/c he knows there won't be any trouble after he is gone. But he is wrong. A large group of men in town want to lay claim to being the man that killed J.B. Books. A few wannabe gunfighters attempt to kill him unsuccessfully in the boarding house.Then 3 men in town want to have a showdown with Books. One is Jay Cobb (played with appropriate scuzziness by Bill McKinney) who is a local brutish loudmouth who had a confrontation with Books when he first arrived in town. The second one is Jack Pulford (played with class by Hugh O'Brian) who is a card dealer at the local saloon; Pulford has a very quick-draw as is shown in a scene where he guns down a dissatisfied gambler. The third is Mike Sweeney (played by Richard Boone in a memorable, scene-stealing performance), whose brother Albert was killed by Books many years before. Amazingly, each of these characters has only one scene in the film prior to their final showdown with Books at the end, yet all leave a lasting impression. Books arranges through Gillom to meet the 3 men in the saloon on the morning of his birthday. The scene where Books tells Mrs. Rogers that it is his birthday and walks out to meet the men always gets to me. These 2 characters have such beautiful scenes together. The final showdown in the saloon is one of my favorite film moments. It is a very tense, suspenseful scene. The ending seems strangely appropriate given the circumstances.THE SHOOTIST is a fine film from beginning to end. Wayne should have gotten a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this (as should Bacall for Supporting Actress). A great way to end a great career!

Hostetler . It doesn't work out that smoothly and soon word has spread that Books is in town. Bounty hunters show up. The sheriff (Harry Morgan) wants him to leave. His landlady (Lauren Bacall) wants him to leave. But her son Gillom (Ron Howard) is fascinated by this legend of a man, and wants to get to know him better. Books old girlfriend shows up, wants to write a book on his life, The Shootist, thus the title.As the movie begins the Books we see is gruff and accustomed to simply giving orders to people around him. Boy take my horse to the stable. And Gillom answers that his name is NOT 'boy', and he responds better when asked nicely. After a couple of days in town, Books has softened up a bit, and even gets to asking Bacall to take a country drive with him in a horse-drawn buggy. The movie is mainly a character study of this gruff and competent gunman in his last days. A good last role for John Wayne, and a good western for the time. My dad, who died 40 years ago, shared a birthday with John Wayne and was a big fan, so this has special significance for me.SPOILERS, for my recollection. I either missed a conversation, or I simply don't understand the logic, but the movie ends on a Sunday morning, when Books wanders over to the local bar where three rival gunman wait for him. Each has a bottle of booze, and each is around the room, separated from the others. Then one shoots at Books, misses, and Books kills him. Then another wounds Books before Books kills him. The third seems to have the upper hand, but Books sees a refraction of him in a bar glass, and puts a bullet hole in his head as he peaks around the edge of the bar. Wounded, Books appears to have survived, but another man shoots him in the back.

He plays the part with such dignity, and it is a more complex part than Rooster Cogburn,who bears a resemblance to Charley Allnut of African Queen, but I believe Wayne's best role was Sean Thornton in The Quiet Man.Some of the casting fits the nostalgia for the old West theme so well. Those who remember television of the late 50s realize we have Wyatt Earp as the Faro dealer, and Wanted Dead or Alive as the crusty rancher. I only wish they could have brought in someone like James Arness or Clint Walker to play the third man in the saloon, but a character of that age would not fit the role of Cobb.The site of Harry Morgan jars the senses, especially in that idiotic hat he wears. His attitude and dress are a message that he got the job through politics, something else that comes with the civilizing of the West.And could they not have found someone better than Sheree North?All said, I prefer this film to the morality play of The Searchers and the Remington pieces of the US Cavalry trilogy.

Yep, we see general contractors digging ditches in order to lay down pipes/electric wires, Also, there are such things as a horse-drawn streetcar on rails (to be replaced by an electric trolley planned for 1902, according to the town marshal), telephones, an overhead fan over the Metropole Saloon bar, and even a motor car. As for the last item, it is an historical fact that there were 8,000 automobiles in the USA in 1900, although they were still rare in the West. Ah, authenticity!

Books has an appointment with the town doc, Hostetler (James Stewart), to check on his physical condition. He has been having back pains. As he soon discovers, his troubles are a sign of advanced cancer, and he has no more than two months to live. Now the old gunman is not afraid of death, but dying is a different breed. Dr. Hostetler provides Books with opium-based laudanum for the pain that will intensify. To spend his last days in dignity and settle his affairs, the weather-beaten gunfighter checks into the boarding/rooming house of a widow, Mrs. Bond Rodgers (Lauren Bacall). The house is equipped with electricity and plumbing. Early on the widow is apprehensive about having an old gunfighter in the house, but over the course of eight days, a respectful bond develops between the two. Meanwhile Marshal Thibido (Harry Morgan) stops by to remind Books that his time is past and exults when he finds out that he has only a short time to live. Now there are those in town who are quick to try to take advantage of him.

Even the old-timer liveryman (Scatman Crothers) tries to get his horse for a cheap price. So Books really does not get much hospitality from the town citizenry. This simply told and nicely paced western is symbolic. The movie is filmed during the near middle of winter, with a brilliant sunlight. Locals call the weather the false spring. Indeed Books is in the winter of his years, as is the Wild West. Gillom is in the spring of his life. Will Books summon enough energy to go out in dignity, his last crisis? For there are those who have a score to settle with him. They include the faro dealer Pulford (Hugh O'Brian), Sweeney (Richard Boone), and Cobbs (Bill McKinney). Will Books accept the fate of his last days? How about his surrogate influence on Rodgers' son, Gillom (Ron Howard)? Put it this way there is no gimmick in this flick. Directed by Donald Siegel, this is a sensitive and mature western, but also atypical, as the hero is a dying gunfighter. However, Books does have a code of honor and is no hot-tempered murderer. He feels that he has fought fairly I never killed a man who didn't deserve it. As he later exclaims, I won't be wronged, I won't be insulted, and I won't be laid a hand on. I don't do these things to other people, and I require the same from them! Thus the movie is a throwback that bucked the trend of westerns that &#x96; beginning around 1966 &#x96; began to blur the distinctions between the good and bad guys. Those newer westerns often took away the honor codes of the good guys and left them with . . . only their guns. The trend continued into the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1990s new westerns like The Unforgiven and Tombstone somewhat altered the picture.The Shootist is quite a tribute to one of America's most famous actors of the silver screen. The three-dimensional Wayne conducts himself with decorum throughout. By the way, the Duke starred in some of the best westerns in world cinema history, like Stagecoach (1939), Red River (1948), and The Searchers (1956). In this one he was good enough for an Academy Award (He did receive one for a lesser western in 1969, True Grit). In short the entire cast is excellent, although seeing Hugh O'Brian as a bad guy was certainly unusual, for two decades earlier he had starred in TV's popular The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. Richard Boone too played Paladin in TV's Have Gun &#x96; Will Travel. Wayne's last movie was so much better than his 1970s films like Cahill US Marshal, McQ, Brannigan, and Rooster Cogburn. So it is indeed true that The Shootist was the only way that the Duke could have made his big-screen exit!

Glendon Swarthout's novel provided the basis for Wayne's last oater. John Bernard Books (John Wayne) is a world-class gunfighter who learns that he is dying from rectum cancer. Books' doctor Dr. Hostetler (James Stewart of Harvey) informs him that he is too courageous an individual to suffer such a horrific demise. Our dying hero agrees to a showdown in a saloon against Sweeney (Richard Boone of The Alamo), Pulford (Hugh O'Brien) and Cobb (Bill McKinney of Deliverance) and all hell breaks loose. The bulk of the action concerns the melodrama that occurs between Books and his female landlord Bond Rogers ( Lauren Bacall of The Big Sleep) as he stays at her boarding house and creates all kinds of trouble. The shoot-out in the saloon is tour-de-force, and the close-up of the whiskey glass reflecting the whereabouts of our hero's adversary is impressive. Ron Howard plays Bacall's son Gillom Rogers. Gillom is friends with an African-American stable hand Moses (Scatman Crothers) who shows him Books' saddle. The Shootist has the equivalent of the little boy and the gunslinger subplot from Shane. For the record, the montage of films that constitutes Books' history consisted of El Dorado, Hondo, Rio Bravo, and Red River.

Rather than seclude himself from all of the bright lights and peacefully reflect on both his life and after life, he chose to share the last with all of us, his fans.AT THE TIME, although there were most likely many suspicions of the inevitable's rapid descent, no one knew for sure. After all,Mr. Wayne had made literally hundreds of movies; dating from the last days of the Silents, through the B'S at Lone Star (Monogram) and Republic, up to the attainment of Stardom and features from Batjac (his Production Company).AS FOR THE film, it is much more serious and somber, right from the get go. An opening montage of 'flashbacks' to earlier stages in the life of premier Gunfighter, J.B. Books (Duke) are revealed in the opening. Properly used and done in homage to a career, these 'flashback' references are really snippets of the career Western output from the star's resume.BRINGING THE STORY up to the present day (in the movie), we find that J.B. Books hasn't lost very much in the way of physical skills, nor his cunning; as he foils an attempt by a youthful 'Road Agent' to rob him at gunpoint. His arrival in town serves notice to him that he is now in the early days of the 20th Century. Evidenced by modern conveniences, such as transit, streetlights and improved communications via the telephone, Books is made to feel like a living anachronism.TAKING A ROOM with widow, Mrs. Bond Rogers', boarding house keeper (Lauren Bacall) he intimates that his future plans (even short term) are uncertain. He does confide his terminal condition with former acquaintance, the Town Doctor, Dr. Hosteller (James Stewart); who examines him and verifies his condition.BUT HIS PAST still trails him as guys from both sides of the law seek him out for various reasons. Richard Boone, Harry Morgan, Hugh O'Brian and John Carradine all seek him out; and are dealt with in the best way that he can muster. Relying more on cunning, he is able to placate most with his powerful words.BUT, WE MUSTN'T get too much into the story, for we will reveal its plot and ruin it for those who haven't see nit, both of you.LET US JUST say that this is far more than another Western; but rather a film that forces us to think about our own life and where is is going. Perhjaps it is not truly a Western movie at all, but a view of what a career and life have meant to John Wayne and to the world.

But John Wayne's performance elevated the script into something very special. For most of his career, Wayne played the same character in every movie. The names changed but the characters were always the same. But later in his his career, Wayne began to show that he had far more range than most movie fans knew. The Cowboys stands out as a breakout role for him. True Grit was Wayne as we had never seen him before. But I think he saved the best for last.In The Shootist, Wayne is vulnerable, charismatic and touching. And while True Grit was a great role that demanded an over-the-top performance, The Shootist required a very understated performance of Wayne. Given his history of films, understatement would not seem to be in his repertoire. But he certainly pulled it off.The film is much more of a character study than an action film. Once you accept that, the movie is riveting. The script is good, the veteran cast is accomplished. Ron Howard does a credible job, especially when he pulls the trigger at the end with the same steely-eyed look that Wayne's character had previously told him set shooters apart from killers. And when the film is over, you realize that you've just seen a remarkable acting job from someone who made a career out of being more of an icon that an actor. He wasn't even nominated, but I believe Wayne's performance was worthy of the Oscar for The Shootist.For decades, we saw John Wayne as a Western film icon.

The parallels between Wayne and his character, John Book, are so numerous they're eerie, and even appear to be intentional.A former gunfighter, now approaching death from natural causes, takes some inventory of his life. On the cusp of the closing 19th Century making way for the dawning 20th Century, Book realizes he is a part of an antiquated time that soon will no longer exist. He is akin to Queen Victoria, referenced in the story frequently and who really did die in January of 1901, after a long reign in the just-ended century. Book has a history of a legendary past, with three gunfighting rivals all assembled in Carson City. He goes there, with a plan to cheat nature and exit life in his own chosen way. Look for long time elder actors such as John Carradine (as a mortician), Jimmy Stewart (as Book's doctor) in supporting roles, and Lauren Becall as the romantic interest he can never be with. Also among the fine cast; Richard Boone, Hugh O'Brien, and a young Ron Howard. Wayne's and Howard's characters make perfect counterpoints to one another. The final confrontation makes a lot of blood flow, but the deeper meanings behind the scene are many and outweigh the violence in impact. It's a powerful resolution, with simple but vivid imagery. The lone sound of a newly invented electric fan persists after the sound of the shots fade. A young person tosses a gun away. These are just two out of many symbols summing up the moral of a past that is disappearing forever, and of a new era inexorably replacing it.It's not an original theme; many westerns have addressed this idea, but this film handles it with poetry and precision, and a superb ensemble cast.

Familiar character actors pop up in showy bit parts, while Lauren Bacall (acting a lot older than she was in 1976) gets stuck with the wheezing role of a Christian widow (with too much starch in her corsets!). Wayne's John Books want to die with dignity, and director Siegel certainly gives it to him. Overlit and under-written, the movie plays on our nostalgia for the past without investing anything fresh in this genre. It's like an old '50s western with all the life drained out of it.

Anybody who doubts John Wayne's ability as an actor should watch this, The Searchers and Red River and if they still think he can't act they are clearly biased or an idiot! He is wonderful in this film. Truly moving, deep and perfect delivery of every line. It is a beautiful, perfectly paced, funny, moving and exciting film. Scenes between 'Duke' Wayne and Jimmy Stewart where he is informed he has 'a cancer' are incredible and as Duke had fought cancer bravely, and would ultimately die from it, all the more pathos filled. His scenes with Lauren Bacall are electric and sublime. I was moved to tears more than once.Wayne is probably the most famous and iconic film star of all time and this is the perfect film for his last appearance on screen. It has recently been somewhat duplicated, perhaps unintentionally in Gran Torino which could be Clint Eastwood's last film as an actor. Both films celebrate and remind us of the iconic stars previous image and films but at the same time make it clear times have changed, place those glory days in the past and even question the morals shown by their earlier characters.(However, that is not to say Wayne or his earlier characters were immoral or wrong, in fact I deeply resent the frequent attacks on Wayne and his films for their 'extreme right wing politics'. I am very left wing myself but I do not feel threatened by someone having different views or expressing them publicly. Anyone would think John Wayne was Adolf Hitler the way people speak. What exactly did he do wrong. He supported the Vietnam war but so did a great many people and that does not make him evil. It was one of many views he held which are not considered 'correct' but were held by him for good reasoning. He never had malicious intent in his views. Also his films are not as morally one sided as people make out by any means.) Anyway, it is a great movie. Watch and learn modern film makers and actors!

It was both a frightening look into the very face of death, in this case, cancer, and the way Wayne carried it, with grace, strength, and dignity was certainly worthy of his swan song at the end of his storied career. The brief scenes with his old friend, James Stewart were equally moving, two men in the twilight of their lives, both on screen and off.

Queen Victoria has died, signaling the end of an era. Wayne is John Bernard Books, last of the famous shootists, whose time is also ending. According to the doctor, James Stewart, in the proud and modernizing little town of Carson City, Nevada, Wayne has prostate cancer and will lived about two more months. He moves into the boarding house of Lauren Bacall and has an edgy relationship with her and her adolescent son as he tries to die in peace. He runs into three locals who, independently of one another, would enjoy putting him to rest a little earlier than that. A climactic shoot out resolves the issues.Right away we're all on John Wayne's side. We would be, even if he weren't John Wayne, recipient of the Medal of Freedom, icon of the Western movie, ten-foot-tall Hollywood legend. Nobody wants to watch a man die a slow and agonizing death.What puts us even more squarely in Wayne's corner is that he's such a GOOD man. Feo, fuerte, y dignidad. He's polite to everyone, rarely angry, stern but fair, more sinned against than sinning. Everyone tries to take advantage of him for one reason or another. The local sheriff, Harry Morgan, whoops with joy when he discovers Wayne is dying because Wayne is a headache who won't be around long enough to cause trouble. John Carradine is the cadaverous undertaker who tries to make money from the prospect of his corpse. And he has a saying, The early worm gets the bird. The owner of the stable, Scatman Crothers, happily tries to wheedle down the price of Wayne's horse. Even the barber, a decent guy at heart, sweeps up the clippings of Wayne's hair intending to sell them as souvenirs, and adds a couple of clots from a neighboring chair as well.The writers and the director, Don Segal, show us all we need to see of Wayne's circumstances -- a good man surrounded by a society he's well rid of, rather than the other way around. There are exceptions. Stewart's doctor is okay, and so is Lauren Bacall's landlady. Ron Howard, as her son, is sometimes snotty and sometimes worshipful. He plays a part in the final scene, a hoked-up Hollywood satisfying ending that is strictly commercial and betrays much of the verisimilitude of the earlier scenes.But the film avoids some of the expectable clich√©s. It would have been easy, and must have been tempting, to show Wayne in real pain, writhing in his deathbed and refusing help or analgesics. (Not that Wayne the actor would have even considered playing such a scene.) Instead, we see him wince slightly, only two or three times, before sitting down and hanging his head in exhaustion. Wayne the actor suggests the piercing pain splendidly without overdoing it. I ought to mention the evocative locations and the period production design by Robert Boyle.The movie doesn't avoid ALL the clich√©s, though. It is, after all, a commercial Hollywood enterprise, not an art-house Czech drama that takes place in the rain. Wayne gives Howard a shooting lesson, for instance. The experienced gunslinger giving the young man a shooting lesson is already familiar from -- oh, let's see -- Shane, Man Without a Star, The Tin Star -- just off the top of my head.There is some stilted dialog too. The stylization in True Grit was practically folk poetry and sometimes hilarious, but here it's devolved into lines like, You and Dobkins are two sides of a counterfeit coin. It's not one of Elmer Berstein's more memorable musical scores. And -- when you come right down to it, you must ask yourself about the motives behind that climax. Richard Boone wants to shoot Wayne over an old grudge. Okay. But Hugh O'Brien only wants to kill this dying old man to prove he can do it. You have to wash that motive down with a schooner of draft beer from the Metropole Saloon. And Bill McKinney agrees to a shoot out for no reason except an exchange of heated words on a busy street, the kind you and I have every other day. As for the bartender, don't even ask. And why should Wayne want to kill any of THEM? He's never met any of them before. Well -- alright, maybe he just wants to shoot Bill McKinney because he's so mean looking, and because of what he did to Ned Beatty in Deliverance. I can buy that. The figuring out of these conative intricacies I leave to the grognards.The two most gripping scenes have little to do with guns. Off the screen, Wayne slips in the bath tub and must ask Bacall to help him out of it. And afterward, Wayne appears in a bathrobe and we see that his bare calves are a fish-belly bluish-white, like those of an old man who has worn long johns all his life, whose legs have never seen the sun.All together, a very respectable final bow for Wayne.

I think it has to do with the fact that in this, his last picture, he did such an excellent job of portraying a character who wasn't John Wayne. Here he was, a dying man who had to be convinced of that fact, but once understood, decided that he would do it on his own terms and at a time of his own choosing. In that regard, he received inspiration from old Doc Hostetler (Jimmy Stewart), who upon diagnosing the cancer that would eventually lay him low, challenges J.B. Books (Wayne) with this insight - I would not die a death like I just described,&#133; not if I had your courage. It's intriguing to watch Wayne's character develop from a former lawman and gunfighter into a human being, as evidenced by a couple of interesting scenes. Consider how upon meeting Gillom Rogers (Ron Howard) he reverts to his gruff frontier mannerism of bossing him around to take care of his horse and run some chores. Gillom manages to put him in his place, but Books takes it in stride with a profound sense that the young whippersnapper might actually be deserving of some respect. I also got a kick out of the scene when Books made Moses (Scatman Crothers) the best haggler, a keen way to win a friend and ally. That was just a great piece of character development that managed to take the edge off a gunman who was willing to leave his notoriety behind him.If you remember Ron Howard as far back as his 'Andy Griffith' days, there's no mistaking that Opie Taylor look in his eyes when his mother (Lauren Bacall) first tells him that Books is dying. It's not something a casual viewer of Howard's films would pick up on, but it's definitely there. There was for that single moment, a childlike naivet√© that surfaced that resisted acknowledging the fact that something like illness could bring down a once legendary gunfighter. The relationship that builds from there between Gillom and Books gives rise to the astonishing climax that pushes Gillom to the brink of his own humanity.With no wars to win or country to save, it's a treat to watch John Wayne interact with veteran contemporary Jimmy Stewart, and play off of Bacall's Bond Rogers in a hint of a romance that engenders mutual respect. It's also cool to see Richard Boone and Hugh O'Brian, both remembered for their strong portrayals of classic TV Western heroes, on the other side of the fence as villains of the picture. Along with Harry Morgan as the conflicted city marshal Thibido, The Shootist is a fitting ride into the sunset for these legendary actors, and a worthy send off for one of the all time great screen cowboys who spanned the decades from 'B' shoot 'em ups to genuine 'A' list Westerns.

In 1964, Wayne was diagnosed with lung cancer and underwent surgery to remove his left lung and four ribs. He was declared free of cancer in 1969. Three years after the release of The Shootist, Wayne died of stomach cancer.It is likely Wayne contracted stomach cancer as a result of his role in Howard Hughes' 1956 film, The Conqueror. The film was shot in St. George, Utah, which was about 100 miles from the US government's nuclear testing grounds at Yucca Flats, Nevada. At the time The Conqueror was being shot, the US government was testing nuclear bombs. On May 19, 1953, the Atomic Energy Commission set off Dirty Harry, a 32 kiloton nuclear device. The bomb was one of 126 test fired on the Nevada range between 1951 and 1963. Utah was downwind of the tests, and radioactive fallout blanketed the state. (The fallout traveled as far as New York.) For 16 days, the radiation levels in St. George were 1230 times the permissible fallout level. The government claimed the tests were safe, and that the people of St. George faced no risk from the fallout.A 1980 report revealed 91 members of the crew of The Conqueror had contracted cancer. About half died from the disease. It is unknown how many of the Native American extras contracted cancer as their health was never studied.The stars of The Conqueror who died from cancer as a result of the fallout include Pedro Armendariz (lymphatic cancer 1963), Dick Powell (stomach cancer 1963), Agnes Moorehead (uterine cancer 1974), Susan Hayward (brain and lung cancer 1975).

Far more rare are films such as Don Siegel's The Shootist, which manage to accomplish both simultaneously. One of the least subtly symbolic entries into a genre thriving on symbolism, the film's serving as an elegiac swan song for star John Wayne, paralleling his own aging, dying of cancer and increasing sense of being a relic from a fading era evolves past mere parallelism into an overtly nostalgic tribute to and celebration of Wayne's persona and legacy. Hardly a cinematic triumph as much as a narrative epilogue to a career spanning decades, The Shootist may easily polarize many audience members, incredulously dismissing it as a nauseatingly self-indulgent hull with a virtually nonexistent, leisurely plot a mere construction stuffed with loving winks and self-references (from its retrieval of past co-stars and friends of Wayne's to actually using past footage of his older films for flashbacks) for the sake of giving Wayne one last pat on the back rather than a self-sustaining narrative. And, to be entirely fair, such criticisms are not entirely unwarranted, as the parallels between Wayne (both his cinematic persona and in real life, the overlap cunningly ambiguous) and protagonist J.B. Books occasionally frustratingly bludgeon the audience.Nonetheless, the film redeems itself through boasting a genuinely resonant emotional core and atmosphere of quiet pathos, stoic fatalism and weary reflection. Books' resigning himself to death yet refusing to go out quietly, an icon, having outlived his time fighting to remain relevant (it is immensely unlikely the film would succeed in a cultural vacuum, as the emotional baggage of Wayne's parallelism adds immeasurably to the film's impact) proves enormously affecting, obvious symbolism or not, providing the sort of elegant vehicle for ruminations on age, societal change and challenging heroic preconceptions that fellow genre icon Clint Eastwood would subsequently use to revive the flagging Western genre 15 years later with Unforgiven. Siegel's directorial influence is fittingly less obvious than usual, gracefully abstaining from his usual clipped realism in favour of a lyrical, nostalgic classical Hollywood style more befitting a warm tribute of a film. Yet Siegel's directorial presence is far from swallowed up, instead seizing the opportunity to cap Wayne's career by cannily acknowledging viewer expectations as frequently as his film knocks them down. Siegel takes his time with a leisurely introduction, agonizingly dwelling on Books' age, receding health and pathetic state, as if relishing demonstrating the defeat of the classic Western hero, withering away in solitude. However, after such an unsettling bout of realism, Siegel appears to nod to the essential presence and importance of legends, and, fittingly, fulfills them by refusing to let Books die slowly and quietly but instead forcing him to strap on his guns for one last triumphant showdown. It is with this showdown and Books' inevitable death in a blaze of battle that Siegel asserts his artistic influence the most. As Books falls, the tone of the film, both emotionally and cinematically, changes drastically for its final wordless scene, adapting jittery cameras and kinetic editing, as if physically representative of the 'old days' of film-making falling with Wayne, to be definitively replaced by a newer, edgier cinematic brand. And yet, given the deadened expression on the previously enthusiastic Ron Howard's face, Siegel appears to suggest that there is something ultimately hollow in such a shift, as if laying rest of the time etched black and white values of the Old West in film cannot help but abandon the heart of the medium somewhat as well. Interestingly, Siegel's adherence to classical cinematic style does not prevent him from fully exploiting the film's violent content, pumping his fleeting gunfights with enough spurting blood to give the Hayes code operators of Wayne's heyday heart attacks. As such, Siegel appears to meld both old and new expectations by providing warm nostalgia mixed with brutal, numb, contemporary violence, the odd juxtaposition making both feel all the more unsettling. It is a beautiful bit of nuance echoed by Elmer Bernstein's straightforwardly grand musical score, embracing classical strings and horns and giving the film a boldly vintage feel which equally clashes with its more contemporary aesthetic, as if physically representing the conflict between the old and the new, the romanticized past and unfeeling present. For all the film's shortcomings, John Wayne is truly magnificent in his final performance. Wayne brings a quiet dignity and haunted glaze to his sad eyes beneath the timeless bold grin and bravado voice, a gunslinger tamed and made irrelevant by the forces of nature and societal progress - the two foes he could not outdraw. Refusing self-parody, Wayne is truly magnetic and eerily authentic - a fitting end to a legacy worth celebrating. Lauren Bacall also contributes welcome class, sternness and sombre sympathy, and Ron Howard remains eminently watchable, overcoming the usual 'ethusiastic youth' clich√©s with sheer energy and guarded self-interest. And, while his small role makes his presence feel somewhat gimmicky, James Stewart gives a delightfully heartfelt and frequently chilling, performance as Books' equally grizzled doctor who has equal experience in the company of death. Stewart's boundless charisma and chemistry with Wayne justify his presence, being consistently memorable and enjoyable. Finally, Scatman Crothers is a welcomely energetic and comical presence, endearingly trading banter with Wayne. While hardly a faultless film, The Shootist's genuine emotional impact and superb performances make its saccharine celebration of Wayne substantially easier to stomach, with Siegel's intriguing directorial touches making for a more nuanced and thematically rich watch. A definitive ending note on the Western (for a time) makes the film essential viewing for fans of the genre or Wayne, as well as any seeking a mature reflection on the counterbalancing of classical values and icons with perpetually moving societal horizons. -8/10 "}{"Title":"Great Exit!","Date":"20 January 2003","Score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":"  A very good Cowboy drama/action film that keeps it simple but strong.Good all around production and capitalises fully on the outstanding performance of the quality cast.A timeless Western classic that could have been a masterpiece if it only had a better story and bigger budget.A great last film for the legend himself JOHN WAYNE.Going out as he should in a blaze of glory.Has a good edge to it's flow (Rated R).Nice few scenes of the great James Stewart as the Docktor as well.One of the Duke's greatest acting performances.He truly mastered his acting skills by the 1970's.Only for fans of the genre and big fans of the lead actors.......

Lauren Bacall is absolutely great. James Stewart joins them adding to that immense depth. This is a great nostalgic journey. I would have liked it to be much darker in tone and more action. It does take a look at the act of dying. The search for peace and resignation at the end of this gunslinger's life is very compelling.

If it were Humphrey Bogart in the same circumstance, it's hard to imagine that such an exit film would feature TV funny man Harry Morgan gleefully clicking his heels over the impending screen death of the dying actor's character, and all but ad-libbing a new chorus to that Munchkin Oldie, Ding-Dong, the witch is dead. (Vaudeville comic Scatman Crothers DOES just that, belting out a verse about John lying A-Mouldering in his grave to the tune of John Brown's body.) It's also tough to picture Lauren Bacall cursing a croaking Bogie with a Dam you for the pain you've brought to this house! or the on-screen love of Bogie's life storming out on him with the benediction, You Bas+Ard, may you rot to death!

We see the icon play J.B. Books, a terminally ill gunfighter (or shootist) who is looking for an appropriate, relatively painless death. With Wayne succumbing to a terminal illness several years after the release of this title, 'The Shootist' becomes an almost unsettling, but very dignified, swan song. The iconic actor is joined by fellow actor James Stewart, and fans of 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance' (one of my favourite Westerns) will be glad to see the reunion of these legendary performers. A second icon to join John Wayne for his final film is the actress Lauren Bacall; she has a stronger presence in the film than Stewart, who only appears in a couple of scenes, and she delivers a very good performance. John Wayne has generally been regarded as a second-rate performer when compared to the likes of Stewart, Tracy, Bogart and other actors from his era, but 'The Shootist' boasts a career-defining performance, on par with (if not surpassing) the actor's parts in 'The Searchers' and 'The Quiet Man'. Complemented by a strong Ron Howard performance, Wayne's final film benefits immensely from truly stellar acting. I would also draw attention to some of the technical aspects of the film. The cinematography, to begin with, struck me as very modern for a Western. I wonder if this was intentional, as 'The Shootist' frequently addresses the twilight/death of the Old West. You won't find the sort of shots famously associated with John Ford in Don Siegel's Western, and this helps in establishing the film as, basically, something different. I also noticed how the score seemed, if not anachronistic, quite eccentric. Elmer Bernstein really brings something magical to 'The Shootist' with his uplifting, unmistakably epic sound. Overall, I rank John Wayne's final film amongst my favourite Westerns, and it is a truly fitting send-off to one of cinema's most iconic stars.

John Wayne, as the title might suggest, stands with one foot in an earlier time, and another in the first year of the twentieth century. The film has magnificent imagery. The characters are completely believable, with only John Carradine bowing to inevitable type casting. Ron Howard is compelling as the representation for the hope of the future, understanding that Wayne is really a living legend, and it's time for legends to become that.This was a fitting conclusion for Wayne. The character of J.B. Books could not really have been portrayed by anyone else. Wayne gave the role what it needed, a conclusion to a career. Geroge C.

When good, mostly misanthropic mayhem executed with maximum no-fuss efficiency and graphic force. The gamut runs from the sci-fi hysteria of the original, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, to the kinkily erotic, hot-house cat and mouse of THE BEGUILED (Siegel and Eastwood's most atypical picture) and of course, the shocking vigilante classic, DIRTY HARRY. All display the director's editing prowess. MADIGAN is the one Siegel film for my money with a modicum of heart and it climaxes with his most moving action sequence. His montage technique does right by the Duke at the end of THE SHOOTIST as well, but there's a big difference between the outsider anguish of Richard Widmark's hard luck cop and the challenge to do justice to an American icon in the person of John Wayne. MADIGAN is carved with an edge to it, THE SHOOTIST feels like it's painted by the numbers. The construction is plainly theatrical with one two-hander scene following upon the other with deliberate metronomc precision. The story covers the last week or so in the life of a gunman, J.B. Books, who, in order to avoid the agony of dying from cancer, sets up a gun battle against three formidable enemies that will either crown his legend or end his life - or hopefully, do both. There's no doubt about THE SHOOTIST having about it the aura of a death watch relating directly to the actor's actual state of health. But Siegel takes too easy advantage of this.The best episode in the movie is where Wayne prevails upon the priggish widow played by Betty Bacall to step out with him for a Sunday buggy ride on a brisk fall spring afternoon. What's touching here is that the scene is not only revealing of Books' character, but it betrays the essence of Wayne the man's nature as well; for contrary to popular misconception, his persona was not in the mold of the Gary Cooper strong silent type. Wayne, the American movie myth was, in fact, a talker, a sardonic, compelling amusing talker representing a unique compound of personal stoicism and a compulsive need for the company of others. This is the key element that distinguishes him from other tough guys. He NEEDED us as much as we needed him. And he inveighed upon us to join him. Bacall is the audience's stand-in in this particular scene. The direction is unobjectionable except when one imagines what Sam Peckinpah would have done with it. With Wayne, or, if not him, with, say, Brian Keith.Wayne was a strong charismatic character but (like all of us), he had his insecurities too. As he got older, he got mellower in some ways, but he wanted to persuade, cajole, lay down the law and get people to take everyone of his on the set suggestions seriously. During RIO LOBO, Howard Hawks, the master psychologist, let him go, making him think he was running the show more than he actually was. Somehow, I don't think on the set of THE SHOOTIST, Siegel was quite so shrewd or so gracefully accommodating. The movie is a proper, respectful enough tribute to a towering Hollywood monument, but the coolness I felt on watching it again last night cannot be explained entirely from the air-conditioning.My grade 6.5Was this review useful to you? "},{"Title":"The perfect send-off!","Date":"11 May 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":" The Shootist (1976) is a great movie, not in terms of film-making but in the superb final performance by John Wayne.Even at this late stage in his extraordinary career Wayne was able to transcend his usual He- Man image and deliver a very moving performance of subtly and depth. John Wayne's performance alone is what makes The Shootist memorable.There is a grand contradiction between Wayne, the man and Wayne, the actor. Although many enjoy Wayne's brutish yet inspired performances, it becomes increasingly hard to countenance the man and his politics, overt racism and ties with the House On Un-American Activities. It seems that Wayne's hawkish beliefs were compounded and radicalised by his shame at not having served in the US army during World War 2 when many of his compatriots did, such as Clarke Gable, Henry Fonda, John Ford and Jimmy Stewart. After the war, John Ford would cruelly berate Wayne in front of cast and crew for his lack of military service. Out of respect for Papie, Wayne would be shamed into silence and docility. Other directors willing to work with Wayne would suffer the consequences as he would often vent his frustration on them in a vain attempt at some sort of retribution. A lot of directors and actors refused to work with Wayne primarily due to his fervent political views. He lost the desired role of the lead in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck because of a personal grudge and had to beg for the lead in The Cowboys (1972) primarily because the director was opposed to Wayne's pro-Vietnam war views.Wayne by his own admission can be considered a racist. It can be confirmed by reading his interview with Playboy in 1971. It is incredible to believe that after having worked so often with Native Indians that he found it impossible to say a good word about them, unless it was scripted and delivered by one of his characters. Equally he felt the African American to be inferior and this raised more problems as Roscoe Lee Browne was cast opposite him in The Cowboys (1972). Initially, the director, Mark Rydell did not want to cast Wayne in the pivotal role but Wayne persisted. Rydell and Browne agreed that Wayne's participation might be possible if no conversations should take place that involved American politics.Wayne was grateful for the role and by all accounts was on his best behaviour. Again he, striped himself of any baggage and delivered one of his most moving performances. It is hard, if not impossible to imagine any other actor in the role.It is interesting to note that Wayne shares a bottle of whiskey with Roscoe Lee Browne during a scene in The Cowboys. The characters drink from the same bottle as a relationship of mutual respect develops between them. As Bruce Dern found out to his detriment, murdering Wayne on screen could has very powerful repercussions. In The Cowboys, Bruce Dern arguably plays one of the most vile villains ever created for the screen and because Wayne's characters so seldom died, the shock of seeing him repeatedly shot with the final merciless bullet entering his back caused Dern to receive death threats in the mail and offers of work to go into decline.Katharine Hepburn refused to work with Wayne when she was offered the lead in Hondo (1953) because of his devotion to the rampant anti-communism of the time but finally consented to star alongside him in the sequel to True Grit. In this sequel Wayne again plays the lovable buffoon and drunkard Rooster Cogburn. For the production Wayne had director approval and another grudge surfaced when the studio offered the movie to Richard Fleischer. Wayne had him replaced with Stuart Millar. In Rooster Cogburn (1975) Wayne plays a character that becomes a benevolent father figure to a young Indian boy in stark contrast to his own feelings for the race. Katharine Hepburn commented on Wayne's ability to argue with most people on set. At the wrap party she reportedly told him, I'm glad I didn't know you when you had two lungs, you must have been a real bastard!The more Wayne became the icon of America so he left behind the more ambiguous roles of The Searchers (1953) or Red River (1948). His performances in each of these movies are powerful and intense yet these films were tailored to produce a redemption for each character to show that in no way could Wayne be an out and out villain however convincing he may be at portraying one. After these two classic movies Wayne stayed firmly within the character he had created for himself. The all American hero! It was not until The Cowboys and The Shootist that we were allowed to see a greater depth and subtlety in John Wayne's performances. So there is an odd duality to Wayne the actor, Wayne the man. His personality was suspect and in many respects wholly distasteful yet his films and performances remain and many are superb and life affirming with The Shootist being the perfect send off.

This is an excellent movie and is indisputably the best Western of Wayne's post Liberty Valance oeuvre (my apologies to fans of Cahill U.S. Marshall. haha).I gave it 6 stars out of 10 in IMDb, which is a good score with me. It accumulated 15 points in my ranking system, which is a very solid score.Here's what I liked- Unique movie about a man dying of cancer who actually was dying of cancer. Wayne had survived lung cancer ten years earlier and already had cancer again when this movie was filmed. Wayne's ersatz father figure, John Ford, died of a slow death from cancer a couple of years before this movie was made. Duke also watched his mom and brother slowly die of cancer.- One of the best acting performances of Wayne's career. - Inspired casting of Lauren Bacall. She brings the perfect tone of sadness and feeling to her role. Surprising how old she looks in this movie, though. She was only 52.- Great cameos by James Stewart, Richard Boone, Harry Morgan, John Carradine and Hugh O'Brian. Watch for Bill McKinney as Cobb, the creamery owner/gunfighter (?). McKinney played the heavy 'redleg Captain Terrill in The Outlaw Josie Wales that same year.- Nice representation of turn of the century Carson City, Nevada, replete with trolleys and early automobiles.- Excellent comic relief by Harry Morgan, John Carradine and Wayne. This is much needed in a story that is inherently dark and depressing.- Perhaps the only Western Wayne made in 20 years where there's not an obligatory group fist fight (this could be seen as a negative, depending on your point of view haha).Now here's what the movie got wrong- JB Books character is too one dimensional. Did he really develop such a large reputation and never, ever kill anybody who didn't deserve it? Always an angel of justice? No regrets? No guilty conscience whatsoever? This serious character development flaw of the poor gunfighter dates back to 1950's The Gunfighter.Eastwood got this right in his own Western swan song Unforgiven. We like Will Munney, but he's still a legitimately disturbed and scary dude who's haunted by his past transgressions. JB Brooks biggest flaw is that he's a little grouchy sometimes.- They blew the heavy role by splitting it into three weak parts. The part should have concentrated in the capable hands of Richard Boone.- If Boone's character had been properly developed, then the final shootout might have made a little sense. As it was filmed, it almost ruins the entire movie. Why does Books feel it is necessary to kill these three men before he dies? What evil did they commit? Did the bartender have to die too? Wait a second, I thought Books only killed in self defense or if somebody was really, really, really bad. Again, compare to a much better film Unforgiven. All those guys in the bar deserved to die because of what they did to Ned.- I didn't buy the Ron Howard subplot about his redemption from juvenile delinquency. It felt gratuitous and contrived.- Nice attempt to work some landscapes into this Burbank back lotter. Not enough for my taste, though. - 1901 Carson City setting is stretching the limits of the genre Western. Took a hit in may rankings in the Indian, Mexican, Civil War category as a result.

John Wayne may have done some not-so-good films in his time, but that is pretty much it with every single actor and actress in existence, but he has also done some great ones as well.

A couple of hours spent watching The Searchers should have put that particular misconception to bed, of course, but in case that had been too long ago for you, The Shootist some 20 years later should have done the job.Yet The Shootist is so much more than Wayne's best (or, arguably, second best) acting role out of his considerable filmography. It is also one of those rare movies where the film holds a mirror up to the real world and carries a reflection of real life - in this case, a man facing his mortality and seeking to achieve something at the end which carries more meaning than the legend which preceded it (On Golden Pond comes to mind as a film which contains similar reflections).All the supporting cast is excellent, and turn-of-the-century Carson City is beautifully, if poignantly, evoked - it is an ever-present reminder that JB Books has lived beyond his time.And Wayne is simply phenomenal in a performance which shows that he could do it all the time. Part of me thinks What a waste that he was never required to deliver performances of this quality in films of this quality. The film is composed in a highly elegiac style by Don Siegel - among his most sensitive and distinguished work - but there is no sentiment involved in fact, the exact opposite. Books' cancer and death are hard and uncompromising. But Books' death, and the film The Shootist, are successful in achieving what Books/Wayne intended - a fitting capstone to the lives of the character/man.

It was the right genre, the perfect character, and the quintessential story for one of the American cinema's idols to finish off a succession of pictures that have since gone on to become some of the most memorable and influential works of art in history. It also featured the ideal supporting cast (many of them aging stars like Wayne himself) for the Duke to act with. Note the word 'act' in my sentences. Those who have thought of John Wayne's acting ability as hammy or over-the-top, then you best see The Shootist and ponder over your own words before you go pass judgment on one of the most talented individuals who ever worked in Hollywood. Because if Wayne's final performance is not a first-class case of acting, then neither was Vivien Leigh's portrait of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind, or Meryl Streep's gut-wrenching expressions in Sophie's Choice or Gregory Peck lecturing his children in To Kill a Mockingbird. John Wayne was no longer the tough-as-nails, brawny fighter he was in his youth and neither was his character. By contrast, he plays a famous world-weary gunfighter who upon visiting a doctor who once saved his life after a shootout (James Stewart) discovers he will die in less than two months not from a bullet, but from cancer. The dying gunfighter decides that he is going to die peacefully in a boardinghouse run by a widow (Lauren Bacall) and her rambunctious son (Ron Howard). However, some of the town's people are not so willing to let Wayne go in peace.Perhaps next to Akira Kurosawa's marvelous film Ikiru, The Shootist may be the most powerful film to tackle the subjects of cancer and, more importantly, life and death. John Wayne, as many know, had been diagnosed with cancer before making The Shootist. Although he recovered from it, he would be stricken by it again, this time fatally, after his last film and personally, I believe that Wayne knew deep down in himself while making this movie that his time was running short and you can see him pour out his heart into his performance. The result is a deeply moving portrait of a lonely, dying man whom the world never gave a chance to truly understand. Wayne does not speak (often) in his usual brass, fear-inducing tone but with a rather soft, woozy voice and his eyes constantly reflect the pain and misery that is going through his mind. Since he had first-hand experience with cancer, Wayne knew exactly how to carve this character into a three-dimensional human being.The supporting performances are absolutely fabulous. Lauren Bacall, whose husband Humphrey Bogart had also died of cancer, is compelling as the landlady who discovers she's really, in a way, tougher than the gunfighter she's reluctantly housing. Ron Howard is very good as the young kid who, not unlike Brandon DeWilde did to Alan Ladd in Shane, looks up to the gunfighter without knowing the true consequences of making your name with a weapon. There's also a terrific cameo supporting role by John Wayne's close friend James Stewart as the doctor who diagnoses him with cancer. Supporting roles also go to great names such as Hugh O'Brian, Harry Morgan, Richard Boone, and Bill McKinney as the townsmen and troublemakers who just don't want to let the poor man die in peace.The Shootist was directed by Don Siegel, and therefore the audience knows right off that they are not to be disappointed by the action scenes. But Siegel's directing is at its best in the more tender moments such as the truly tear-jerking scene where James Stewart breaks the bad news to Wayne about his health. The Shootist is not simply another rowdy Western with lots of gunfights, men swigging whiskey, and fists flying through the air. It has all of this and much more; it has a human story that touches our hearts. And most of the credit is due to the star, John Wayne, whose performance is so marvelous and three-dimensional that we instantly see him as more of a human being than we ever have before. Let's face it some of Wayne's previous roles were a little repetitive. They were, after all, written for him in the John Wayne image. But here's a more gentle portrait, a more realistic one in which we can look beyond the external appearance of a legend and see what goes on in his heart.

And, that's probably why THE SHOOTIST didn't get more than one Oscar nomination in March of 1977.They doubtless consider Westerns, science fiction, and feature-length cartoons as nothing more than glorified kiddie-schlock! But, when it comes to THE SHOOTIST, they are dead wrong. This Western, which Leonard Maltin has described as John Wayne's valedictory film, is a thinking man's Western. In hindsight, it's almost autobiographical!People like me might not have agreed with everything that John Wayne held sacred. But, no one could ever legitimately accuse of him of being a hypocrite, either! He always said what he meant, and did as he said, especially in the second half of his career.That's the exact same philosophy espoused by J.B. Books during the prologue of the film. Some might call such a philosophy hokey. But, with all due respect, the only ones who could possibly do so are the same ones who probably don't live by _any_ code of honor, themselves, whatsoever!Unfortunately, that would seem to describe most people, these days. Especially, our leaders. They seem to live by codes of expediency and pragmatism. And, more's the pity. Because, I'm unalterably convinced the world would be in a lot better shape than it is, today, if everybody tried to live by a credo at least similar to J.B. Books.He might be a fictional character. But, he still comes across, to me, as being realistically human in the sense that while he might not be a saint, he's not a totally unrepentant sinner, either.Diagnosed as terminally ill with cancer, he tries to go out in a blaze of glory that will also serve as a mercy killing. But, in the process, he also teaches Gillom, the son of his widowed landlady (masterfully portrayed by Ron Howard and Lauren Bacall, respectively), that you don't have to be a gunman to be a _man_!The bittersweet irony is that Gillom learns this lesson only after killing the cowardly bartender who shotguns J.B. in the back.Even more ironic is the the fact that the then-new 20th century which many Americans hoped would be a more peaceful one--for both their country and the rest of the world--proved extremely the opposite. The last eighty years, alone, seems to have proved that peace is now just an interval of time during which the defeated side from one war prepares to become the victor in the next war.Thirty-two years after its theatrical release, this film dishes out a surprising amount of food for thought.

It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. Very good!

I guess you could say that I was expecting a little more action than what I got as the overall pace dabbled on the sluggish side. My only real complaint however was JB Books constantly using the phrase I'm dying or some version of it. He kept saying this every five minutes in a conversation and it lost its effect after awhile. I mean at first I felt bad for him but then I'm like okay, okay I get the point. However it was still a classic in the making as there were some great quotes and everyone did a really fine job acting-wise! This was an awesome move on Mr. Wayne's part to be in this as his last movie since that made it a little bit more sincere and enabled him to go out with one last hurrah. I have to admit that it was weird seeing him and James Stewart appear so old in front of the camera because I'm used to their much younger appearances. I liked it a lot, but I caution against it if you're looking for something that won't be a tad bit on the depressing side or doesn't have an uplifting ending.Final MatchMovies It wouldn't make sense seeing this on the big screen these days.DVD Purchase Once was enough for me.Rental A wise decision!

The initial description of the movie provided by this web site needs to be a bit more 'real' and 'true'....I give a 1, the location in the movie is Carson City Nevada, John on the movie, is dying of a cancer. If you have ever lived in the Carson or Washoe valleys the mountains and terrain ARE on location... but not mentioned in the 'filming locations' the actual plant life etc... trees and scrub are accurate. A little perplexed 'how' they must have marked out the fire lines (only a couple) or signs of road and ranches still there - its still pretty wide open - but the hills and mountains are the ones we see everyday... and I recognize them as I do a lot of hiking and driving in the area - Slide Mountain is clearly there...so a lot of this was filmed 'very close' to Carson City itself - within 30 miles and probably more like 5 or 10 miles. The town was all Hollywood and could be Burbank. John was dying of cancer when he made the film and the film was made for him for that reason. Those are two facts I didn't see in the forefront where they belong. God Bless you John.

But it seemed smaller and less interesting from my older perspective.Wayne is compelling as a tough guy undiminished by time. He's a man who has killed a lot, perhaps mostly because he was great with a gun and had no tolerance for disrespect -- today we'd see such a guy as a coward with an anger problem -- and his repartee with a bumbling robber in the movie's first scene is priceless. We can't help but like him here. And Wayne's disappointment with the pettiness of his fellow humans in his waning days is indeed poignant.But I found a number of the other characters tedious. Lauren Bacall's widow, with her oddly British accent and judgmental attitude, wore on me. And her unpleasant son, played by a Ron Howard looking too old for the role, was equally repugnant. More minor characters seemed merely stereotypical, like the hack newspaperman and town sheriff.I liked the detail of the brothel pillow, and the fact that its significance wasn't elucidated. But I don't think this film says very much to a modern audience about man's approach to his mortality.

Wayne plays ailing gunman JB Books who visits a sawbones played by Stewart, who confirms what Books already knows he has terminal cancer and only a short time to live. Booker takes a room in a rooming house run by Lauren Bacall, and prepares to die there. Then he changes his mind and decides to have it out with three assailants on his birthday, which is only days away. As per the usual with Wayne in his later roles, he has a young sidekick, this time played by Ron Howard as Bacall's son and who watches over the dying gunslinger/former lawman. Hugh (Wyatt Earp) O'Brian and Richard Paladin) Boone play two of Books' assailants. THE SHOOTIST, which begins with clips from several Wayne westerns, is not an action movie, saving the major fighting for the closing minutes. Instead, it is a character study of a man trying to coming to grips with his sometimes notorious past and find some peace before dying. Bacall, as his concerned landlady, plays well opposite Wayne, who brings incredible dignity to a difficult role. John Carradine, whose son Robert costarred with Wayne in THE COWBOYS, plays the town's creepy undertaker who has plans for Books' soon-to-be corpse. Harry Morgan is the town's gruff sheriff who can't wait for Booker to die, Scatman Crothers is the friendly but cagey liveryman and Sheree North plays Books' old girlfriend who is looking to make a killing from his death. Interetingly, the movie is set in 1901, the same year employed in an earlier Wayne film, NORTH TO ALASKA.

As a fan of John Wayne, when I learned that The Shootist was Wayne's last movie I rented it interested to see what it would be like.  Throughout the movie I couldn't help but think how it paralleled his own death of cancer just a few years later.  You could say the movie was prophetic. When Wayne died in the The Shootist we also saw the last performance of a great actor that we'll never see the likes of again.  I also couldn't help thinking how symbolic the movie was in another way. In 1976 Westerns were on their way out. Consider just the following year the release of Star Wars which I believe marked the beginning of the public's desire for special effects-action type of movies.  Beginning in the 80s westerns were no longer in vogue. The genre seemed to have died with John Wayne in 1979.  The movie itself was about the end of an era.  The end of the 19th century west and a dying gunfighter.I really wish that Wayne's last movie would have been a positive one. I think Rooster Cogburn would have been a great last film. It's my favorite of his 70s movies.  However, I am glad that his last one was a western, fitting for his character and career "},{"Title":"John Wayne's Last Movie","Date":"22 July 2001","Score":"2 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":"  The first thing to say in all honesty is that if this hadn't been John Wayne's last movie, no one would be remembering it 25 years later. It features some good performances and some not so good, and a plot that leaves too many holes and unanswered questions.I have to concede first off that I have never been a huge fan of John Wayne. I've always seen him as a largely one-dimensional actor with little versatility. True, he plays the one dimension well, but that's a little like being a baseball player who fields brilliantly but hits .160. You might find a spot on the bench, but you'll never be a star. That is what mystifies and intrigues me about Wayne. This one-dimensional actor somehow struck a chord with audiences and became a larger than life mega-star! Go figure!Anyway, he was actually rather good in this movie, showing himself able to carry a film that wasn't all shoot-outs or war battles. Perhaps it stemmed from the fact that he was playing a character (gunfighter J.B. Books) who was dying of cancer - just as Wayne himself was ill with the disease at the same time. Perhaps this gave him deeper insight into the role than he would have had otherwise. Wayne demonstrates a surprisingly sensitive side of himself here that made him more interesting to watch than usual. He was supported by strong performances from Lauren Bacall as Bond Rogers, Books' landlady,  and by James Stewart as Dr. Hostetler, the town doctor. These strong performances were unfortunately detracted from by a couple of weak showings, however. I know there were glimpses of him as a bit of a rebel with a nasty streak, but overall Ron Howard (as Gillam Rogers, Bond's son) still came across as too golly-gee wholesome to fit the circumstances, and Harry Morgan was a major disappointment as the sheriff whose only wish is for Books to die quickly.Add to this some problems in the story. There are several unanswered questions why was Carson City so important to Books that he wanted to die there? What was the significance of the date January 22, 1901? And (possible spoiler here) arranging a gunfight as a way of dying (to prevent yourself from having to die of cancer) seems an uncertainty at best, especially when you're a famous and successful gunfighter and you're obviously taking the fight seriously. What if you survive? (Which Books almost did!) Then you're right back to Square 1 dying a terrible death from cancer. Too many holes for me to really think this was a good movie.I was going to give this a 4, but out of respect for a movie icon such as Wayne - and given that this was his last film - I'll be generous and move it up to a 5/10. "},{"Title":"Off target","Date":"2 August 2005","Score":"4 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Western","Review":" The western is an iconographic genre, films typically checking in references to numerous fixed points and images; and John Wayne was arguably more an icon than an actor; so it's fitting that Wayne's last film, made when he was dying of cancer, should have been a western about a gunman in a similar predicament. The parallels go further; westerns are typically set in the time when the old wild west was being replaced by a new age of civilisation and authority; while 'The Shootist' was made at a time when the very genre of the western itself was about to die ('Star Wars', defining a new type of movie-land frontier, came out the very next year). Unfortunately, these intriguing echoes cannot hide the fact that 'The Shootist' is fundamentally a bad film Wayne can't act, the film bestows upon his character a preposterous and unjustified dignity; and, as in so many westerns, the rate of attrition simply doesn't make sense. If men were really ever so keen so shoot each other as the characters in this film, all would be dead long before the age when cancer would be likely to strike in the film's showdown, six men take part in a battle that leaves five of them dead for no rational motivation whatsoever. For a more intelligent reflection on similar themes, watch 'Tom Horn', made by another actor on his last legs, in this case Steve McQueen. It may not be the most sophisticated film ever made, but it at least makes sense, which sadly, 'The Shootist' does not.

His films in general and his westerns in particular drown in unrealistic American WASP-ish values and unrealistic history . Look at the opening sequence when Wayne`s character protects himself from a would be mugger . In reality most gunfighters were poor shots , not to mention most of their victims died after being shot in the back , so the idea of shooting someones gun from out of their reach is rather laughable because these things didn`t happen , and going back to the historical unreality Wayne`s character is responsible for killing 30 men in gunfights , but in reality the top gunslinger in the wild west - Depending what source you read - is either Jim Miller or John Wesley Hardin neither of whom killed more than twenty men in gun fights I can understand the subtext of THE SHOOTIST . Wayne was diagnosed with cancer and this is supposed to be a tribute , but instead of being sad and poignant ends up as feeling both self indulgent and tasteless . It also jars stylewise since this type of western ( That had more or less been invented by John Ford ) had disappeared after the likes of A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS , THE WILD BUNCH and THE CULPEPPER CATTLE CO were released a few years earlierWhat you think of this film all depends on what you think of both John Wayne and John Ford .

The idea of a 70-year-old gunfighter was ridiculous. A much better actor like George C. Scott should have been cast, and the character Books should have been in his late forties. Lauren Bacall looked 60 and was far too old to play the mother of a teenage son in 1901. It's hilarious when she says her husband died only recently at 41. James Stewart looked about 80 and was far too old to play a man who had only been working as a doctor for 29 years. Aside from the entire cast being far too old for their parts, the film itself is just a slow, boring, low budget, made-for-TV effort. Watch the much better The Gunfighter (1950) with a 34-year-old Gregory Peck instead. Wayne was not dying when he made this film, contrary to popular belief, and if he had gone on to star in another five films then nobody would remember this oversentimental snoozefest.0/10.
