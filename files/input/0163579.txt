I've always looked upon Cuba Gooding Jnr as a semi decent actor but if this is the kind of film he is going to be starring in, then I can see him descending the same way as Charlie Sheen.You can see from the outset that the makers tried to make one of those high octane action thrillers, which are ten-a-penny these days. But when you've got a budget that would struggle to finance an episode of quantum leap, then maybe making a film of this kind wasn't such a good idea.They make use of computer graphics in a lot of the action scenes which, to be honest, doesn't look the worst I have ever seen, but still prompts you to snicker at how bad it is. The most ridiculous of which occurs at the end of the movie, when a chemical weapon which we have been told has the power to blow up basically a quarter of America, detonates in a tunnel.At this point we are subjected to rotten computer graphics which are so bad that I instantly had flashbacks of Dean Stockwell and the film-making atrocity that was the Langoliers.But the story is complete nonsense, so even with a budget the size of Lord of the Rings, there would be no way of making the whole thing believable anyway. So you can perhaps see where the producer was coming from i.e. lets make a cheap action thriller and we'll plaster Cuba Gooding's face over the front cover and we'll maybe make some money.It would've have been better if Eric Roberts had been given the leading role.

Cuba plays an ice cream delivery man named Arlo while Skeet plays as a connivance store clerk in Montana named Tim Mason. David Paymer plays a role at the beginning of the movie that lasts about 30 minutes and he plays the best friend of Mason who is a scientist named Richard Long.The movie starts on an island in which some sort of military establishment is. Dr. Long is in charge of this radio-active bomb named Elvis that he's been working on for a long time. Him and his assistant decide to test it out but it goes all wrong and Long's boss comes in named Bryner. If the bomb were to reach 50ยบ Fahrenheit, it would blow up and massacre anything in it's 5-mile radius, that exact radius of the island. The bomb reaches 50ยบ, which must be the CHILL FACTOR and it blows up. 17 soldiers are severely killed and in the scientist shelter, the military boss, Long, and his assistant survive. Next scene, the boss is charged for all of it even though it was all Long's fault. The boss goes to jail for 10 years. Next scene, 10 years later, Bryner comes out and seeks revenge. Now in Montana, he assembles a small team of smart assassins to travel with him to avenge what Long did to him. Meanwhile, Arlo (Gooding) is doing a 4 AM ice cream shift and Mason (Ulrich) is doing a connivance store night shift. The assassins invade the research center of Long and he gets shot. Already some plot holes. Long barely makes it to Mason's store, almost dead while Arlo is there to deliver $400 worth of ice cream. Long tells his best friend that he's about to die and that he needs him to bring the remaining radio-active bomb that detonates at CHILL FACTOR to the military base. This time, this Elvis is much more stronger than the 5-mile radius one. Long said he needs Arlo's ice cream truck to keep the temperature down on the bomb. Long dies, and Arlo and Mason are off to put the bomb in its proper place with Arlo's ice cream truck while the assassins are on him. Thus concludes the first 35 minutes of the movie. Note that Arlo doesn't appear in the movie until 25 minutes in. The adventure (with this twisted plot) is on. Tensions flare, in comedy as Arlo wants to get the hell away from Mason and far away as possible but Mason threatens him with a revolver forcing him to continue driving during the early parts of they're trip. They soon find out that Bryner is on their tail and they have to improvise or die.Overall, Chill Factor is a decent action/thriller with good comedy in it but somewhat fails to impress. Maybe it's the lacking, holed plot. Good effort by Cuba and Skeet though. If you got some time and you want a good buddy film, check this one out.My Rating 7/10 Objectively 6/10 Subjectively 7/10 Eliason A.

Kevin Thomas is an awful liar, lemme tell you.A dreadful action-adventure turkey, this starts out squarely on the wrong foot on some deserted island somewhere mad scientist David Paymer is experimenting with some kind of superweapon he calls Elvis. (This joke will subsequently be rammed into the ground, covered up with dirt, then dug up and rammed into the ground again as the movie progresses.) Peter Firth is the good-guy American soldier who thinks Paymer's out of control, Paymer pulls rank, does the test, of course something goes wrong, most everybody dies and Firth gets shafted, sent for ten years hard time in Leavenworth.Got that? We cut to the present, Firth gets out and he's the bad guy? (????) And Paymer's some kind of sympathetic hero? (??????) Huh? (I'm gonna use up my ratio of question marks, you get the idea.) Anyway, Firth, who now has a Hollywood-approved multi-cultural, fully integrated team of bad guys, shoots Paymer while looking for Elvis, who he's gonna sell to the highest bidder. Paymer, bleeding to death, improbably summons up enough strength to give it to Skeet Ulrich, who's the only guy he can trust. Ulrich (gamely trying for The Hero With A Troubled Past, but really just reminding me of various convenience store clerks I know) shanghais Cuba Gooding Jr.'s ice cream truck, which conveniently happens to be parked outside (Gooding is doing The Hip Urban Guy Whose Wisecracks Are The Comic Relief; it's an embarrassing role for any actor, and Gooding does not enoble himself here.) I personally was rooting for the bad guys throughout, which is kind of a problem in these sort of movies. But anything to shut Cuba Gooding up. Apparently they blew their budget on a few effect shots -- the schtik of the movie is that the bomb has to remain cold or it'll go off, and you'd think there'd be a lot of sequences playing around with that, but not really, and whenever it looks edgy there's always a cold mountain stream or a handy fat guy with a case of beer in a cooler to save the day. Most of it is a dull car chase around what looks like a resort town in Montana.My guess is that early versions of the script were much more of a straight up black comedy, with two lunkheads saving the day for the wrong people. Bill and Ted meet SPEED. Something like that. But maybe that's just my imagination that'd make a good movie, though, huh? "}{"Title":"Hoo-Eee!

For an action movie it simply isn't a very good one, not in the least because it also borrows heavily from other movies and just isn't original enough on its own to really add anything. The movie is like Speed meets Die Hard meets The Rock and than some movies thrown in the mix with it.No, I didn't really enjoyed watching this movie, even though the movie obviously got aimed toward it to bring some entertainment, by also adding a dose of comedy to the movie. Gooding Jr. has just never really been my favorite comedy actor and Skeet Ulrich just doesn't fit this genre. The movie tries to be like a buddy flick, in which two totally different mismatched persons just by chance end up with each other, running from a couple of bad guys who want to have a new deadly chemical weapon that detonates when it reaches temperatures over 50 degrees. Luckilly Gooding Jr. is an ice cream truck driver. This already should provide you a troubling image of how this entire movie is being like. Seems amazing to me in the first place that they decided to turn this concept into a movie. Its concept alone was reason for people to not go and see this movie, which made this movie an instant flop already, far before it had been released. And why some of the actors within this movie actually agreed to be in it is perhaps an even more strange thing. The movie does have some big names in it, next to Ulrich and Gooding Jr., such as David Paymer and Peter Firth.A movie that is as bad as its concept.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Doesn't fit anywhere...","Date":"6 May 2008","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I am not a huge fan of Cuba Gooding Jnr, but enjoyed his performance in Radio, and as all actors put in the occasional good performance, I thought I'd give this fim a go.

Pursued by a renegade military General, the duo set off against all odds to return the weapon to the nearest secure outpost, but there's a hitch; they have to cross the desert to do so.It may be more Renny Harlin than William Shakespeare in its premise, but the end result is a riotous hour and thirty minutes worth of entertainment. Skeet and Cuba make for a great on screen pair, their bickering providing plenty of laughs and one liners, while Peter Firth is brilliant as the scenery-chewing villain. What makes it even more fun, is that unlike its contemporaries, the two lead characters are utterly hapless. They are just a pair of ordinary guys thrust into a situation beyond their control rather than muscle-clad, indestructible body-builders or Kung Fu experts and they only really survive unscathed by bumbling through the fight scenes.You can tell the cast are having a great time and in all honesty, Cuba Gooding Jr seems to be enjoying himself so much it's a surprise he doesn't grin like a cheshire cat throughout the whole movie.

Ulrich plays a deli worker whom is the only one Paymer can trust on the verge of death, but the role has him either fleeing by vehicle or on foot. Gooding Jr. brings comic relief but the role is total cardboard. Paymer does well but his role requires him to regret, guilt and then die within fifteen minutes, which renders the role a prop. Firth cannot raise the commander above embarrassment. He murders the Paymer character then spends the remainder of the film trying to do the same to Ulrich and Gooding Jr. He also yells threats a lot but that may be the attitude coming from working on this film.

Some films are put on this world to entertain and that's what Chill Factor's goal is. It certainly does in parts as well. The first twenty-five minutes were looking sort of grim, but the pairing of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich worked in the film's favor because the script made Cuba's character smart and funny. Rarely do I leave a movie wanting more, but I actually wouldn't have mind if after the credits the film kept going.The story is a strange one, and it doesn't help to just evaluate it for hours. But a bomb has been made that will explode if it reaches fifty degrees Fahrenheit. This bomb, nicknamed ELVIS, is now in the hands of Arlo (Gooding Jr.) and Tim (Ulrich). The rest of the film is a cat and mouse chase between Arlo and Tim and the US Army who wants to obtain the device so they could sell it to a foreign country and get revenge on the United States.This also one of those films where its better to go along for the ride than try to evaluate it. I had fun just watching everything unfold. Sometimes I was lost, and other times, I was enjoying myself. I used to watch countless action movies as a kid, most notably Speed, and not pay any attention whatsoever to the dialog. I would just rock back and forth and enjoy the explosions, fast cars, and tension. If I saw Chill Factor as a kid, I think I would've found my new favorite film.When compared to Cuba Gooding Jr.'s previous action film, Judgment Night, this is greatly inferior. When compared to current action films that have nothing more to offer than fast cars, wet t-shirts, and six packs, Chill Factor's premise may be a little bulky, but it's acceptable. It isn't long. Isn't convoluted to the point of confusion amongst the audience. It fits into the box it picked.Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. and Skeet Ulrich. Directed by Hugh Johnson.

This was the case with Chill Factor but this movie wasn't as entertaining as I thought it was going to be.The story revolves around a military science experiment that goes bad. The Major in charge of the experiment is held responsible for the disaster and is thrown in jail for 10 years. Flash forward 10 years and the Major is released from jail only to be extremely bitter towards the government and attempts to exact vengeance by stealing the chemical weapon that was developed during that experiment to sell to the highest bidder. In walks Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr's characters. They are a couple of ordinary guys that invariably get mixed up in this mess and what ensues is a plot line about a group of renegade mercenaries, lead by the Major, who chase down these two Joes to get these chemicals back.The plot line is somewhat similar to another movie, The Rock. Despite that, I do have to say that the performances that Ulrich (who looks amazingly like Johnny Depp) and Gooding Jr. give are quite good, especially Gooding Jr's. He tends to dominate the scenes that he is in purely on the fact that he makes the most with what he is given. This is definitely the sign of a good actor. Also, the constant bantering between him and Ulrich is quite humorous and the chemistry between the two actors is very evident.The special effects are also fairly well done and if you like explosions, there are plenty of those. Being billed as an action flick, the movie definitely follows the action flick formula of plenty of explosions, lead characters fighting against ridiculous odds, some gruesome deaths and eye catching stunts. It also means that the plot leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the dialogue is just not very good, especially the ones delivered by the villain (Peter Firth). At times, I found the dialogue so filled with cliches that it was annoying. It got to the point where I knew the line before it was spoken. Now, mind you, I realize that with action movies, this kind of corny dialogue is going to happen but at least make an effort to come up with something somewhat creative. Also, the premise that a couple of ordinary guys could outsmart a group of professionally trained soldiers is a bit hard to believe.Overall, if you check your brain...and your vocabulary at the door, you will find this movie entertaining.

The bomb reaches 50ยบ, which must be the CHILL FACTOR and it blows up. 17 soldiers are severely killed and in the scientist shelter, the military boss, Long, and his assistant survive. Next scene, the boss is charged for all of it even though it was all Long's fault. The boss goes to jail for 10 years. Next scene, 10 years later, Bryner comes out and seeks revenge. Now in Montana, he assembles a small team of smart assassins to travel with him to avenge what Long did to him. Meanwhile, Arlo (Gooding) is doing a 4 AM ice cream shift and Mason (Ulrich) is doing a connivance store night shift. The assassins invade the research center of Long and he gets shot. Already some plot holes. Long barely makes it to Mason's store, almost dead while Arlo is there to deliver $400 worth of ice cream. Long tells his best friend that he's about to die and that he needs him to bring the remaining radio-active bomb that detonates at CHILL FACTOR to the military base. This time, this Elvis is much more stronger than the 5-mile radius one. Long said he needs Arlo's ice cream truck to keep the temperature down on the bomb. Long dies, and Arlo and Mason are off to put the bomb in its proper place with Arlo's ice cream truck while the assassins are on him. Thus concludes the first 35 minutes of the movie. Note that Arlo doesn't appear in the movie until 25 minutes in. The adventure (with this twisted plot) is on. Tensions flare, in comedy as Arlo wants to get the hell away from Mason and far away as possible but Mason threatens him with a revolver forcing him to continue driving during the early parts of they're trip. They soon find out that Bryner is on their tail and they have to improvise or die.Overall, Chill Factor is a decent action/thriller with good comedy in it but somewhat fails to impress. Maybe it's the lacking, holed plot. Good effort by Cuba and Skeet though. If you got some time and you want a good buddy film, check this one out.My Rating 6.5/10 (A Mid 6.5)Eliason A.

Hot on their tail come the men (and one woman) who will stop at nothing to retrieve the explosive as well as a dimwitted sheriff who mistakenly believes the two young gentlemen are responsible for the death of the scientist who both invented the substance and guards it from falling into enemy hands.`Chill Factor' is a decent enough action film, short on credibility and originality but high on energy and visual attractiveness.  The latter is attributable mainly to the gloriously scenic and beautifully photographed Montana countryside where the film is set.  `Chill Factor' is also, however, replete with the usual array of action movie staples  impressive but wholly implausible action and stunt sequences, the running exchange of dimwitted quips and wearying verbal badinage - sometimes between the main characters themselves and sometimes between them and those who are out to kill them - that occurs virtually without pause throughout the movie and, finally, stock villains that come straight from the cinema factory that seems to spit out these cookie-cutter action films with almost unconscionable frequency. On the positive side, director Hugh Johnson knows how to keep the action moving forward at a brisk pace and Gooding and Ulrich, despite the fact that the screenplay offers neither actor much of a chance to flex his thespian muscles, at least make for a likeable movie-buddy team.  Still, one wonders whatever happened to Gooding, Jr.'s career which seemed so promising just a few years back after he won the Academy Award for his work in `Jerry Maguire.'  Likeable as he is in `Chill Factor,' one would like to see this performer applying his talents to more challenging and worthy fare than he has of late been doing.

Otherwise, prepare to be disappointed. The surface problem with this movie is its inability to decide whether it is an action film or a comedy. Some films - notably the first Lethal Weapon - manage to straddle the divide to good effect, but not this movie. The violence is gratuitous and far too graphic for comedy (both the opening and the climax are unsuitable for the weak of stomach), and the comedy is too broad for an action movie, as well as being forced. However, what really sinks this film is the lack of any plausible motivation for any character involved. For the first 15 minutes, Major Brynner seems to be the good guy, and Long the mad scientist; yet in jail Brynner is somehow transformed into an evil megalomaniac. This conversion is never justified in the film. Meanwhile, Long has supposedly suffered 10 years of terrible guilt over carelessly causing so many deaths in act 1 - but not so terrible that he has stopped developing the weapon responsible. Yet, we are supposed to regard him as the good guy - at least, one minor character gives us a tedious monologue on how wonderful he is. And then, 20 minutes into the movie he abruptly dies (not a spoiler - it's in the trailer), leaving Mason and Arlo (Ulrich and Gooding) to save the world. Confused? Apparently, so were the writers of this nonsense.Mason and Gooding's motivation for taking on this mission is never even remotely established. Arlo's excuse, that he is threatened with a gun, is discarded about 30 minutes later when Arlo says he knew Mason wouldn't shoot; and besides, what stopped him from handing over the keys to his van and exiting the story? Indeed, the dull scene in the boat where each tells his backstory, supposedly explaining his motivations, is easily the worst in the movie, highlighting the limited acting talents of both Ulrich and Gooding. Thus, as the film enters act 2, none of the characters introduced in act 1 is alive or recognizably the same person, and the protagonists have only just appeared. Midway through the movie, another key character, Colonel Vitelli, joins the chase. (Apparently the writers missed the class in Screenwriting 101 where you learn not to introduce key characters halfway through.) Vitelli apparently has a history with Brynner, but that seems to have finished up on the cutting room floor, leaving us with a bizarre scene in which Vitelli tells us that he knew all along it was Brynner (so what? that was never in doubt!) and Brynner again confuses us by laying justifiable claim to being the good guy (apparently, he was demoted for protecting civilians in Vietnam). The possibility that Vitelli might have pursued Mason and Arlo in the mistaken belief that they were the terrorists is thus introduced and disposed of in the space of minutes, neatly killing what might have been the only interesting complication in the progress of this story. Once Vitelli enters, the second half of the movie reprises the same idiotic chases and explosions of the first half, yet no obstacle is allowed to stand for more than a couple of minutes before our two young heroes dispose of it. As a result, the film never manages to achieve any sense of tension or jeopardy.The film is so riddled with plot holes, starting with a terrifyingly powerful doomsday weapon that can be stolen by 3 people simply by killing 4 guards, that they are hardly worth cataloguing; but it is the character holes, rather than the plot holes, that ultimately sink this movie.

They can work sometimes, CON-AIR for example, it's plot was simple, but the action scenes were great and so was the acting. But CHILL FACTOR, wants to be another big action film with little plot and big action scenes.  The problem is that Director Hugh Johnson not only got a dumb plot, but also dull action scenes.The plot has a military scientist Dr. Long (David Paymer) test out a new defense system on a private island.  Because of poor miscalculation, most of the soliders on that island perish, and the scapegoat is Capt. Andrew Brynner (Peter Firth), the person in charge of the soldiers.  Capt. Brynner is sent to prison for ten years, while Dr. Long transfers to Montana.  Ten years later, Dr. Long is released and seeks revenge on Dr. Long, and wishes to steal the deadly chemical that sent him to prison, and sell it to the highest bidder.While Capt. Brynner and his crew kill all of the security at the secret military base, Dr. Long is shot by Brynner, but not bad enough to steal the chemical before Capt. Brynner can. Dr. Long takes the chemical and gives it to his fly-fishing friend, Tim Mason (Skeet Ulrich), a short-order cook.  Before Dr. Long's perish, Long tells Mason and a ice cream delivery man named Arlo (Cuba Gooding Jr.), to take the chemical to another military base, and to keep the chemical below 50 degrees or it will explode.  So it's a race against temperature as Mason and Arlo outwit Capt. Brynner and his team and try to take the deadly chemical to the closest military base.This is a pretty bland film, the plot seems to familiar (a lot like SPEED meets SORCERER) and the pacing of the film is slow.  Some of the action scenes are pretty typical, they look like action scenes taken from such movies as BROKEN ARROW, BREAKDOWN, and SORCERER.  And the outcome of the film is a let down.  The only thing in this film that somewhat stands out is the acting by the two leads (Gooding Jr. and Ulrich).  Both men do a respectable job with their acting, and seem like that they give it their best shot.  But it's not their fault that the screenplay doesn't work. As for the other acting, Paymer plays a typical scientist in jeopardy before he dies, and Firth is following the betraying military Capt. by the book.  The book titled I am a terrorist, who's trying to be cruel.The one thing that really bothers me is the logic.  I can buy and enjoy two secret service agents trying to stop a mad scientist and his deadly female assistants trying to assassinate the president with a 80 foot tarantula.  But I can not buy two men, one a cook, the other a delivery, the only physical strength experience one of these two had was being a football player.  And these two ordinary men, out-wit and kill a team of highly trained soldiers.  The soldiers aren't too bright, since they overlook Dr. Long's blood while Long stole the chemical before they got a hold of it.Overall, CHILL FACTOR is a weak movie, a typical film released off-season.  Had it been released during the summmer or winter, it would have been only been big for a week.  But since it came out in early fall, it's going to be big for two weeks.  Stick to a Jerry Bruckheimer action film, they're more entertaining.  ** (out of five) "},{"Title":"Ready for Thanksgiving","Date":"27 August 1999","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  This film practically gobbles, it's so bad. At one point, I though it might even tip over to a parody of the thriller genre, but the funniest parts were unintentional.   Cliches and unlikely, even impossible plot points and lack of continuity abounded.  I realize the script was probably a first effort by a pair of 20-something boys, but these boys aren't even remotely clever.  They shouldn't be allowed near a word processor (or better yet, a pitch meeting) ever again, at least not without adult supervision.  And may the equally untalented director be similarly rewarded.Cuba Gooding, who can be wonderful, was so hammy, he resembled Stephin Fetchit at several points.  This was the first time I'd seen Skeet Ulrich, and he's a cute Johnny Depp lookalike, the perfect bookend for the Sharon Stone clone in one of the few female roles.  David Paymer, who is usually a talented actor, has a grueling death scene in this that is unintentionally as funny as some of Bruce Vilanch's work.I'm certain this film was created with the special effects first (gratuitous violence, literal cliffhangers, and things blowing up) and then a storyline was sketched out to incorporate this unlikely series of events.   The plot, such as it is, involves a deadly substance, developed by the Paymer character, that Ulrich and Gooding, as two ordinary guys, are trying to keep out of the hands of the bad guys, a highly trained paramilitary group. Unfortunately, I suspect this film will do fine at the box office, as some in the audience seemed to find it more entertaining than I did.   While not my favorite genre, I like decent action thrillers (e.g. Escape from Alcatraz), and audience acceptance of dreck like this makes it even more difficult for more challenging films to get produced and released.

The only condition is that the weapon must be kept below 50 degrees Fahrenheit or else it will go off and kill everything for hundreds of miles.When I sat to watch this it was really because it had been a good few weeks since I had seen a really bad film &#150; from the plot summary I had assumed that this would be one, even with my low expectations.  In no way did I think this was a good film but it wasn't as rubbish as other reviews have suggested &#150; rather it is simply uninspired, clichรฉd and silly.  The plot seems daft and it is &#150; mainly because trained military special ops can't seem to catch two small time crooks driving a clapped out van in the desert.  However it manages to be enjoyable as it keeps moving constantly and stops you being distracted for even a second, lest you should ask questions.The action is OK but never really gets the tension up in the same way that Speed did.  The director is owed a lot of credit, despite the clichรฉs he really keeps the pace up and makes this better than it should have been.The acting is not good but is acceptable and is all that is needed for this sort of film.  Ulrich is not a leading man and Gooding Jr seems to be trying to prove that the Oscar was a one-off, but together they have an easy chemistry despite it being the usual old mismatched buddy movie banter.  Firth plays a traditional bad guy and Paymer seems to have taken his misguided scientist straight from the clichรฉ text book.Overall this is a poor film.  It has no real good ideas of it's own (even the `keep it below 50' idea is someone else's) and it is clichรฉd all the way.

Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Arlo and Skeet plays Mason.  They are two guys that have been thrown into this highly improbable situation and they are forced to get along.  At first Cuba only agrees to go along with this because he has a gun pulled on him and he is protecting his ice cream truck.  His truck represents a dollar figure to him as he took it from his former employer for money owed.  And this is where the true strength of the film lies.  Ulrich is great in here but it is Gooding that made me howl with laughter.  There are a few spots in the film that I honestly didn't see coming.  And when you can laugh at an actor doing his thing like Gooding is doing in here, you feel the money you spent was well worth it.  Gooding's timing is perfect and his comedic ability is really showcased here.  When he wasn't on screen it wasn't as fresh as when he was.  Whether it is a facial expression, a scream, a jibe, a subtle gesture like taking ice cream from his over turned truck or his genuine but silly looking fear in his eyes, you are glued to what he is doing and can't wait to see what he is going to do next.  He was a total asset and the best part of the film.  The action was pretty good too.  There are many inventive ways for terrorists to die, and two in particular are shocking.  One involves a motorcycle meeting a truck and the other involves a terrorist hanging from a mountain that also gets to shake hands with a truck.  I really can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this film.  For an action film, I laughed non stop and I was marveling at some of the stunts.  I am not saying that this is a flawless film but what I am saying is that it tries hard to be entertaining and it succeeds at that.  Even if you don't like the film that much, the one thing it will do is make you laugh.  Even when it suffers from things like the talking killer, it makes up for it with some clever lines.  Chill Factor is a film that really should be given a chance.  I think it wanted to please and even though it lacks in a few areas, it is robust and awesome in so many others.  I am giving this film 9/10.  It really is that good.  Action films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Lethal Weapon get 10's because they are the best.  But Chill Factor is a worthy imitator and if you want to see something that is a great diversion, see this one, you won't be disappointed.  I really do love this film!

This movie has been done before, only much better.   The plot is razor thin, (with about as much depth), the villains are cardboard cutouts and the acting is nonexistent  Cuba Gooding Jr. does a poor imitation of his  Rod Tidwell character from Jerry Macguire - but at least he has that to fall back on. For some unknown reason Ulrich keeps being cast for roles, even though no one has been able to wring anything resembling a performance out of him. Flat, boring, and nonsensical, this movie left me cold.

However, this major Hollywood is just as bad as many of the worst B films. Despite a respectable budget, the movie looks quite cheap, sometimes embarrassingly so, like when you see a guide cable hooked to the boat, or when you see that a major highway up a mountain is A DIRT ROAD (?!) The protagonists are annoying little jerks, and you feel sorry for Gooding for playing a foul-mouthed stereotyped hustler. In fact, the chief antagonist is more sympathetic than they are! There's also not that much action, and what there is has been filmed a la Speed 2 (jiggily camera close-up). Even if it's free on TV and you're feeling undemanding, you'll feel as frustrated as I felt at the end.

It was very much like those BAD unreleased features that you can see at two o'clock in the morning on the cable channels-- you know, with a bunch of unknown actors who resemble other, more successful actors. So what's the deal with Cuba Gooding, Jr.? He is so talented, I can't imagine that he'd be hard up for a job. Perhaps his participation in this disaster was because he lost a bet?The movie began with a very good sequence, and one of the best special effects of its kind that I have ever seen. But it quickly deteriorated into a dreadful parody of every action flick clichรฉ. And you just know that a parody of a clichรฉ must be bad. The plot and story logic were so flawed that within ten minutes I stopped caring whether anyone lived or died. Events were inserted into the story so amateurishly that what was happening on the screen resembled decoupage. Patch work. Here's a simple example of how poorly written, executed, and edited Chill Factor really is I saw the movie tonight with some friends. I returned home directly, and thought I'd record my vote and comments with IMDb. I wanted to discuss some of the movie's events and plot devices to illustrate my points, so I planned to use a Spoiler Warning. But I needn't have bothered. Here I sit, not an hour after the movie was over, and I can't remember half of what happened, nor how it ended. No spoiler, folks-- it was all so insubstantial and unmemorable that it faded away within minutes! Aaagh! I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because of the nifty opening effects. Those I remembered. "},{"Title":"Third Rate Guy Flick","Date":"21 March 2000","Score":"5 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  This 3rd rate action adventure guy flick will probably set Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s career back about 10 years.  This film is basically a variation on `Speed' where instead of keeping the bus above 50 mph, they had to keep the unstable chemical warfare bomb below 50 degrees.Two regular guys (actually two screw ups) must save the world from a group of rogue military mercenaries who are trying to steal a potent chemical weapon and sell it on the open market.  The chemical is unstable above 50 degrees Fahrenheit and will explode stripping the skin from any living creature within a hundred miles.  Our heroes must get this doomsday weapon to the nearest army base armed only with a broken down ice cream truck and a pistol with no ammo.  The half a dozen bad guys are all have elite military background, the latest in electronic equipment, souped up SUV's, and an arsenal of advanced weaponry.  Predictably, the mercenaries are no match for our screw ups.This film is one big chase scene that takes implausibility to new heights of incredulity. The dialogue between Arlo (Gooding) and Tim (Skeet Ulrich) is mindless tripe that attempts to be funny but merely makes the characters seem pathetic.  This is consistent with all the writing in this screenplay which is mostly hack.As far as I can tell, this is Hugh Johnson's debut as a first line feature director, having mostly done assistant and second unit direction and cinematography.  In this regard he fails to distinguish himself.  His camera work was pedestrian and scene selection was pretty much stock for the genre.  The first third of the film was shot with a blue filter, to get a dark look.  The odd thing was, he kept the blue filter for the indoor shots and subsequent daytime shots.  This indiscriminate use of the filter, rather than creating an effect just made the entire film look washed out.  Then suddenly, he abandoned it entirely.  On a plus note, the stunts and pyrotechnics were handled well as were the special effects when the chemical weapon test went awry at the beginning of the film.  There were some effective moments of suspense like when they tried to take the oversized ice cream truck past the narrow road on the cliff.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. did his best to bring life to a very insubstantial character.   He was witty and energetic as always but there was no saving Arlo.  Skeet Ulrich was utterly bland as Tim Mason.  David Paymer was decent as the arrogant scientist who's ambition for his work exceeded the limits of prudent science.  Peter Firth was dreadful as the evil Captain Brynner, leader of the rogue soldiers.  All in all, this film was a loser.  I gave it a 3/10.  For guys who want a good beer buzz movie while the wife and kids are out of town, this might be okay.  Otherwise steer clear.
