The fact that the film refuses to wink at the audience or play funny music during all the absurdity, makes it all the more impressive. Everything in this movie subverts itself - - in the big satiric moments, this is obvious (the car crash after which Kent's face is unscratched), but one must look closely at what seem to be serious or sentimental moments to realize that these are indeed hilarious and subversive moments as well (the romantic dialogue between Carolyn and Pumpkin is completely absurdist if you keep in mind Pumpkin's problem.)Indeed, most Americans are used to films cueing them as to when they are being serious and when they are being funny and audiences are trained to watch for this.  Because Pumpkin doesn't do this, a lot of its humor probably goes over the heads of people not used to anything this poker-faced - - especially when done with such sweetness.The reviews I've read try to condemn Pumpkin by pigeonholing it into one genre or another - - either the mean-spirited sharp satire of Todd Solondz or the over-the-top buffoonery of the Farrelly Brothers - - but Pumpkin is neither. Indeed, when you realize that Pumpkin fits in no box and, in effect, challenges our notion what a movie should be, you're set free and you begin to laugh at what is the funniest film I've seen in a long time.

It seems about equal in the hate to love ratio. So if you want to watch you will be taking a jump and won't know if you like it or not until you've seen it. But for me, I am in the love section, so I would recommend everyone watches it at least once before judging it.The movie centers around Carolyn (Christina Ricci), the beautiful, popular girl with the boyfriend all the other girls want. Everything is perfect for Carolyn, until her sorority decides to volunteer to help mentally challenged kids prepare for the Challenged Games so that they can win Sorority of the Year. Carolyn's partner is Pumpkin (Hank Harris), and while at first she is confused and scared of him, she soon finds out there is more to him deep down. A love interest in Pumpkin could make her looked down upon by everyone who surrounds her, and possibly ruin her perfect life.A lot of people seem to like bashing the film, while others simply talk about how much they like it. Pumpkin is one of, if not, my favorite movie, so I would give it a 10/10 because it has everything I like; not because of the acting, filming, directing, etc. I'd recommend you to watch Pumpkin and decide how you feel about it.I also find people think it is offending (haters) or sweet and touching (lovers).

We've all seen the &#145;nerd gets girl' bit. Well, this time it's taken to the &#145;next level' if you will. The plot revolves around a stereotypical &#145;prom queen' type of sorority girl falling in love with a mentally (and physically) handicapped boy, and how everything she once held dear falls apart because of it.This is the sort of project that Christina Ricci has made a career out of doing. Namely, dark comedies. She plays against type insofar as she's considered a rather &#145;edgy' actress, yet her role in this flick is that of the &#145;popular girl'. A role in which is has obvious fun lampooning. The subject matter would make one think that this would be a conventional straight drama, but it isn't, which is perhaps what elevates it above what could be typical tearjerker schlock. The film never takes itself too seriously, there's always a bit of &#145;winking' involved. Take for instance when Ricci's character tries to kill herself by overdosing on Night Quill and Pepto-Bismol-only to succeed in making herself sick to her stomach.However, while satirical, it does make good points on how the general public view and think about the mentally handicapped. How beneath the platitudes and seeming self sacrifice, most people still view them as &#145;unequal' to the rest of us-people to whom mouth service is given, but true acceptance of is never a genuine consideration.The way everyone turns on Ricci's character (her friends, her boyfriend, her parents) when it's made clear her feelings for her &#145;special friend'-it's very poignant and very real (if not also very farcical). And one supposes that it's because of that blatant bias of others that make her make out scenes with said &#145;special friend' so satisfying. She not only accepts him, but accepts him as a woman accepts a man. One has to admit, there's something oddly esoteric about seeing her have an implied sex scene with a &#145;retard'. It sort of warms the cockles of one's heart.&#145;Off beat' is the best way to quantify this film. It toes the line between full-blown farce and full on drama. Satirical yet genuine.

The direction is erratic, and the tone of the film changes from scene to scene, yet it is certainly unpredictable and the cast is game. I don't know if the focus of the movie was changed midway, but the later sequences have a sweet nuance to them, as if a big softie suddenly took over to see this thing through to a happy ending.

The film boldly treads on thin ice, clumsily at times, as it tramples social constructs from decorum to morality while managing to maintain a marginally interesting storyline.

All the things that Pumpkin is not seem to really confuse people, and when they're confused, and don't get it, they don't like it. But if you go into this movie without real expectations, you will probably find yourself very pleasantly surprised, especially if you pay careful attention to the Cinderella reference at the end...*spoilers in the following paragraph* What Pumpkin is, is completely surreal (like a fairy tale). The plot is surreal Sorority girl Caroline McDuffy has a perfect and not-normal-in-its-normalcy life, until she falls in love with the retarded Pumpkin. The presentation is surreal I've read more comments that say it's not believable when Kent lives through falling off a cliff in a car that blow up. It's not supposed to be realistic or believable, and more than the scene where a nun and some rats block Caroline's line of sight, or the scene where her poetry teacher kneels to her, or the scene where Pumpkin hits Kent, or the scene where Carolin takes Pumpkin to the ball. The acting and dialogue and tone are surreal - just a bit too two-dimensional, plastic, clich√©d, but it's fakery with such depth (rather reminds me of Holly Golightly; a phony, but a real phony). Completely bizarre.In addition to surreal, Pumpkin is also funny, edgy, over-the-top, sometimes touching, and ultimately ambiguous. Therein is the brilliance of Pumpkin - it keeps you on edge, guessing. But as long as you're not trying to analyze it, box it, type it, or whatever, that's fun.

A dark teenage comedy, Pumpkin tells of the story of the perfection obsessed sorority girl Carolyn McDuffy who falls for Pumpkin, a mentally challenged boy she meets when her sorority house agrees to coach some `special people.' The film forces the viewer to look inward and confront their own prejudices, but it does so in such a strange and weirdly paced way that it is hard to recommend Pumpkin, although I think it is an interesting movie. I wish someone like Lloyd Kaufman would have directed it, someone who would take the gloves off and go for the jugular in every scene and really give this material some bite. A movie like this will only work if the filmmaker goes in completely committed to the idea. As it is Pumpkin seems to teeter on the brink of outrageousness, but pulling back every time to stay on the PC side of the fence. It's a shame because this could have been a truly wonderful and subversive movie.

Pumpkin is the story of a popular soriety girl who has the perfect boyfriend and ends up falling for the handicapped boy she is supposed to help train for the special Olympics. Everyone looks down on her and is shocked that one of the soriety girls would want a special guy. They see her as taking advantage of him. But, we get to see Pumpkin grow up and become more abled because now he has something to work toward. His mom treats him like a baby, but Carolyn makes him work harder and he really isn't as handicapped as his mom thought he was.  And in a surprise, Carolyn's boyfriend, Kent isn't a  bad guy, which we find out after he becomes disabled.FINAL VERDICT Overall, I think Pumpkin is about the basic concept Love conquers all.  And it is a sort of Romeo/Juliet story since these 2 young people want to be together but others are against it for silly reasons.  I recommend this movie; the most negative comment I have is it could have been a little shorter.

Unbelievable is the transition to self-discovery via a relationship that develops with a mentally challenged guy who does little more than stare at her initially. The girl's character fills in much of the formation of the relationship as though it were all happening in her head and the challenged character seems to comply and follow through independently. A key question is asked seemly innocently and then revisited at the movie's end Caroline why does the moon ..change..? Caroline asks in the end if pumpkin meant it literally or metaphorically to which he gives the audience's collective What!?!? reply. Not so much that the question is not understood but one is left wondering what that had to do with the overall message of the movie.

Examples Robocop, District 9, Starship Troopers, Stepford Wives ...these are all brilliant satires; yet they are not comedies.I think it's misleading for Pumpkin to be advertised as a comedy. Sure, it's packed full of subtle humour, but like the films I mentioned above, its intent is probably not to make us laugh out loud. Its intent is to give us an offbeat look at society without taking itself too seriously. So if you go into this film expecting something HYSTERICALLY FUNNY (says the Washington Post), you might be disappointed.Another caveat this film is not about disabled people--not like, say, Shine or My Left Foot. True, the plot is about a sorority girl who gets into an inappropriate relationship with a mentally challenged boy, but that's just a metaphor for what the film is really hitting us with. The film simply uses this metaphor to illustrate the screwed-up norms of human society. Pay attention early on to the speech Christina Ricci gives about how sororities & fraternities end up dividing us, labeling us and creating differences where none really exist. I believe that encapsulates what this film is trying to tell us about our world, and you'll realize it's a lot more than just a romantic comedy.In order to fully appreciate this film, you CANNOT take anything at face value. Everything ...even the wooden acting or the melodramatic pill scene or the exploding car (lol)... is designed to be over-the-top, showing us a bizarre world and giving a little wink to the audience. Almost every scene will have you wondering if the filmmakers were being ironic, and that's the beauty of unravelling a film such as this. It's very subtle but well executed, almost like Hitchcock's brand of humour in Strangers on a Train which, similarly, pokes fun at the veneer of polite society hiding the screwed-uppedness beneath (in fact, Pumpkin has a tennis scene that's reminiscent of the tennis scene in the Strangers).I'm not sure if everyone will like Pumpkin but I sure did. If you're a fan of the 4 satires I mentioned in my 1st paragraph, I think you'll like it. If so, I highly recommend the Mexican film Casi Divas (2008) about a cut-throat talent competition, and the Spanish movie El Crimen Ferpecto (2004) about a man trapped in a department store overnight. Along with Pumpkin, these are light-hearted gems that make us think hard about the human condition. Oh don't forget Heathers (1988) which fits right in with the bunch, though a bit on the darker side.

She gradually falls in love with Pumpkin much to the disdain of Kent, her friends, Pumpkin's mother and her parents who all try to stop her from embarking on, what they see as, an ill-fated union.How do you convey an 'out there' story like that in today's world without seeming corny or just plain preposterous? Easy. You make it 'tongue-in-cheek' corny and preposterous. You laugh at the situation and make fun of it before anyone else can. The characters are portrayed as people in the present whose perceptions are frozen in the past. Pasadena, according to the story, is apparently filled with 'the beautiful people' who still believe they breathe separate air from the rest of humanity and are very out of touch with----almost everything. Most of the characters are lovably neurotic in their 'evolutionarily-challenged' state, but I gotta say, Caroline's mother is downright creepy and sinister about it.The unique concept seems almost an impossibility but it is so well-acted and the manner in which it is handled, with sensitivity, insight, irony, humor (I especially love the 70ish/Bruce Lee/Kung Fu music playing as Kent and Pumpkin finally 'duke it out' over Caroline) and genuine sweetness make 'Pumpkin' a movie worth seeing.

Of course she could fall in love with Pumpkin but for the changes to occur so quickly her to be so ostracized by everyone is a bit much. Also, the scene where her ex-boyfriend plunges off the road yet he ends up almost perfectly fine made me laugh. But this movie was not going for being totally realistic. Many of the situations and characters are overdone for more effect. I thought it was a good movie, with a good ending (her hesitation and look back as she walks off with him at the end is perfect, it gives you the feeling that this isn't just a storybook ending where they will live happily ever after).

Films that do not really try to be serious about anything. And, at the same time, sweet stories that can make you cry.The plot is predictable girl meets a boy, they fall in love, yet there are many obstacles which they overcome. A classical love-story formula. Although this particular story brought more obstacles than I expected, making me even doubt if a happy ending was really possible.The characters are lovely stereotypes an overcaring mother, rivalling student girls, who are only interested in winning and keeping their good looks, another type of mother who knows that her daughter will be happy if she follows the rules and doesn't go out with someone from another race, the curious neighbours, the absurdly prejudiced people etc.The beautiful unseriousness of the story a grasshopper crawling through a salad in a luxurious restaurant, the grotesque despair of the sorority girls, the revelations of the heroine after she understands that life isn't as perfect as she thought, a car bursting in flames in mid-air and its driver somehow not dying (although human organism is something rather mysterious and people can sometimes survive dangers that are believed to be lethal). Carolyne's boyfriend accuses her of 'eating yoghurt'(I might have misheard, of course, but I loved it). Carolyne storms off from the beach, talks to her boyfriend, finds out about the sorority's 'tragedy', talks to a teacher and then remembers that Pumpkin is still on the beach, in the company of a lonely sea-gull (the gull is not a major character, more of an extra actually, but I developed a theory about it tying the food and the sun-shade nicely together and carrying it away).And another component the story is touching. Carolyne and Pumpkin really love each other. I watched this at home, so I cheered when they were doing fine and almost cried when it seemed that they would never be together again.

Her charge is Pumpkin, a retarded young man who is partially confined to a wheelchair and dominated by an overbearing mother. Ricci is touched by Pumpkin's sensitivity, and he's in love with her.There are a few funny scenes in the beginning of the film, and there are tender moments as the little rich girl breaks out of her social bonds, but the film never decides what it wants to be - comedy or social commentary.

It refuses to play it safe...Mr. Ebert adds ...there is courage in the performances.I couldn't say it better--and, if Mr. Ebert likes this movie, it's definitely got to be very good.The movie tells the story of how people fall in love for all of the right reasons, or for all of the wrong reasons. It's a matter of making responsible choices, by clearly focusing on love, rather than all of the reasons that detract from it. That is not to say that there won't be ethical dilemmas, in making responsible choices, but an earnest effort to resolve such dilemmas--including economics in the decision- making process--will maximize one's satisfaction. And--including probability in the decision-making process--there will be a good-to- excellent probability for high-quality satisfaction.Because of this, and the courage in the movie's message, I rank the film a 10 out of 10. I added 2 points for doing the right thing, not because of morality, but because of responsible decision-making. There's something positive to be said about muscle, but self-determination adds even more muscle to this movie, and to life's middle-and-end result.

Scenes that are comedically exaggerated are followed by scenes of painful sincerity.  Some actors appear to think they're in a satire while others think they're in a drama, so even individual scenes seem askew.

Abrams) Mostly believable drama about a sorority girl(played by Christina Ricci) who goes out of her way to give special attention to a challenged(aka. mentally retarded) young man, falls in love with him and then faces the wrath of society for doing so. Ricci is wonderful as the confused girl who's been brought up thinking everything in life is wonderful until she meets Pumpkin, who's life is not altogether wonderful and she actually begins to feel the pain in her own life and the the pain that he's feeling. This movie starts out looking like a very corny comedy, but abruptly takes a serious note when Pumpkin, played by Hank Harris, comes onto the scene. The movie fights hard not to be too melodramatic and for the most part succeeds. Ricci's character, Carolyn, immediately starts having a dramatic effect on Pumpkin's social and physical abilities as he improves everyday in her presence and this is seen by those around her and jealousy and curiosity ensues. She begins to care for Pumpkin in a deep way and doesn't know how to handle this so, of course, she sees a shrink. He's not much help though and she's left to figure this all out by herself. The only annoying thing about this movie is it's many emotional twists&turns in direction, mainly coming from Carolyn's twists and turns in her own thinking, but this is bearable because of Ricci's appeal and the understanding that this character is being put through the wringer with her own emotions mainly because of her confused up-bringing and the reaction from people around her. A nice suttle tweak at the end gives us the impression that her confusion will continue, even though the viewers get to have their wanted happy ending. All in all, the weakness in this movie comes from the direction(being done by two individuals, maybe this was part of the problem) but the players, especially Ricci & Harris, rise above it to make a meaningful drama about societies confusion towards the challenged individual and the rift that is there between them and the rest of society.

She has a great boyfriend, good friends, and she believes that everything is beautiful and perfect. Her mother believes that life is easy, that you can exist in a world where there are no problems, and that everything should come easy. The two together are a perfect example blind leading the blind.Carolyn's sorority, in order to win sorority of the year, begins to participate in the Challenged Games. Each girl is assigned to someone who is mentally slow. They are to work with them and help them to get ready for the games. Carolyn is somewhat indifferent about the idea. She doesn't think that it's right or that their sorority should be participating in it. She finds it risky.This is before Carolyn meets Pumpkin. Pumpkin is Carolyn's assigned person. At first, she finds it horrible to work with him. She doesn't know where to begin, she's confused, she doesn't understand what he tries to tell her. After Pumpkin talks to Carolyn a little bit, she begins to realize that he has a beautiful heart. She begins spending time with Pumpkin, despite what her sorority sisters, boyfriend, and family say about it.Carolyn soon becomes confused about her feelings. She begins getting romantic feelings for Pumpkin and she doesn't know what to do. Everything begins to go downhill when her sorority and boyfriend learn this. Carolyn begins to examine her outlook on life and wonder if she was really living to begin with.Review Being a big Christina Ricci fan, I was eager to see Pumpkin. I loved the plot, the cast was good, and it seemed the perfect movie to rent, so I did. Perfect? No, not quite. However, it does deserve a second glance.One thing I found really great about Pumpkin is that it's a movie that you can easily relate to. Everyday we're faced with people who don't approve of the choices that we make. Words can hurt, and they do. This film illustrates that perfectly. Christina Ricci's character, Carolyn, is a popular girl with a seemingly perfect life, but no one's life is perfect. We learn that from this film. While it doesn't go deep into the soul of the character as it could have, we see her problems, her enemies, what makes her tick.Christina Ricci plays her part perfectly. She's become a very versatile actress since she grew up, and I completely respect her for that. Hank Harris is also very good in his role as Pumpkin. We see the character development throughout the film. It may be a little rushed, but it is completely believable and played very well. At times during the film, you forget you're seeing actors. The whole film is very true to life.However, some of the film is a little overly-dramatic. Suspenseful music plays several times in the film in places that I don't feel require it. It leads you to believe that something big is going to happen or that you are going to be surprised, but it doesn't and you're not. It's not that type of movie. Another somewhat large occurrence in the film I find unnecessary and a little off in the film involving Carolyn's boyfriend. Some of the girls in Carolyn's enemy sorority are exceedingly more rude than you would expect. While I can see some tension, I don't think it would be that confrontational. A few other scenes aren't crucial to the plot. I also believe that the F word was completely misplaced in many instances. While it's not excessive, most of the time the word is overly emphasized and just doesn't need to be there.There is enough good in the film to make up for those, though. The whole idea of the movie is wonderful; it has heart. At one point in the film, Carolyn begins realizing that she wasn't seeing the world accurately and begins seeing things that are not beautiful. The film peaks there. It's a wonderful moment and you can really feel what she is thinking and understand her.The film is good and I would definitely considering buying it if I see it for sale. It's not great or perfect, but it's enough and you can see what it was meant to be. Though not a masterpiece or anything original, it'll still win you over eventually.B- (7/10) "},{"Title":"BOMB out of 5","Date":"25 November 2002","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Finally in her career Christina Ricci has decided to take a different turn from her usual dark and depressing characters with Carolyn. Just to bad half way through this film you will be wishing she hadn't. Carolyn has it all, she is pretty, popular and has a boyfriend all the girls wish they had but after she is made help a disordered boy named Pumpkin in a desperate attempt to make her frat house the best her whole life is changed. But the change is not what you may expect. Instead of unfolding like you are lead to believe instead of making Carolyn see the light and be reborn into goodness by Pumpkins existence her life is flipped upside down and she is even driven as far as to commit suicide. The description on the back of the case referred to this film as a touching love story and a hysterical comedy, but I didn't not see either happen in the two hours this film ran. There is nothing remotely touching or even romantic about this film nor is there one laugh to be had from start to finish. This is because the film walks a very thin line between what is considered touching and what is considered downright mean. See this film is cruel and discriminatory and comes nothing close to laughs or tears. The simple fact is that the entire thing is done backwards. The things that are supposed to be amusing are placed within serious scenes that should have otherwise been moving but come off more as offensive because you are not sure if the scene is serious or not. The langue herein is totally inaproperate and actually made me feel rather uncomfortable with viewing this film. It seems like the script thinks that maybe it can make everyone see the point by having all the characters say the word retard over and over again. This brings me to my next analogy. What the hell was the point of this film? A girl with a happy way of living has her life almost totally ruined in an instant and not on thing that happens in this film makes any sense or is in the least bit believable. A film like this should be telling us to look beneath the surface and see people for their inner beauty because after all isn't it that inner beauty that we fall in love with for in the first place? This film almost seems like it is telling us to avoid helping the disabled because they are looked down on as humans. Is that the kind of message we want to be giving out in this day and age? There are only about five scenes in the entire film that deal with the feelings between Pumpkin and Carolyn, the rest is dedicated to stuck up people who don't seem to have a clue of what is going on around them. Sometimes when a film has a terrible story the acting can at least have a little bit of redeeming quality, not the case here. The acting in this film is dreadful, think what you would get if you crossed a lame soap opera with an after school special from the early 80's and you can probably get a good idea of what the acting is like. But the actors are only half the problem, the rest of the fault goes to the terrible script witch is so meaningless it feels like you are driving your car, full speed, down a one way street that ends with a brick wall. Not to mention all the characters are one dimensional and bland beyond belief. We have a leading lady who seems to be living a plastic existence, her mother who thinks the world revolves around her, a boyfriend who thinks he can survive on looks, an overbearing mother who won't let her disabled son grow up and a rude poetry teacher who serves no purpose here but to swear at his students and say rude things and the saddest part of it all is that it is this teacher who has the only meaningful lines in the film. This film also has one of the worst soundtracks I have heard in a long while, the music just drones on and ruins every scene it is in. In the end this film has nothing good or important to say and it has a total of two effective scene, both being mediocre at best. One when Carolyn returns to the beach after forgetting Pumpkin there and another when she sneaks into Pumpkin's room through his window after his mother forbids him from seeing her anymore. Other than that the film is a total waste and could be the worst of the year. Save your money and go see a film like Elephant Man which actually has some heart behind it because this seems like it is nothing more than someone's idea of a sick joke.

I was really surprised to see rather low ratings for this film on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, but I really think this is one of those sleeper films that will never be epic, but the story is great and it's an easy film to take-in. This is a comedy so dark, it makes Heathers appear vanilla in comparison. They stop at nothing to make a joke, which takes a huge risk of offending a number of viewers &#x96; and I admire that bravery. Many sites say the film is the most underrated in a decade.Basically, Christini Ricci has an Elle Woods-type perfect boyfriend, a perfect sorority life and a family who thrives on status when her sorority chooses to help disabled persons as their charity for the year. Each sister is assigned a person to help, and Ricci ends up falling in love with her retard (a word used a great deal throughout the movie), has sex with him and shatters her perfect life.A good portion of this movie certainly isn't politically correct, however, Ricci's character serves as the balance, making many of the dark elements laugh-out-loud hilarious.

Her chapter is signed up to be involved in the challenged games, which she opposes. Ricci's character does not want to be associated with `those types of people.'  However after getting to know one of the challenged athletes, named Pumpkin, she falls in love with him.  Satirical and witty in a dark way, Pumpkin challenges our views of sorority life, mothers, and the mentally retarded. Carolyn's sorority is depicted as being superficial and vengeful.  They shun Ricci's character for being too close to Pumpkin, but suck up to her when their chance of being the sorority of the year is in jeopardy. With the exception of Carolyn, the women are one-dimentional characters.  They are preoccupied with image, or how they are surveyed. They are viewed from the male perspective, and cater to what they think fraternity men want to see. Carolyn sees beyond their sheltered view with help from the simple and caring Pumpkin. Pumpkin's mother is overprotective of her son.  She pressures him to be a challenged athlete, neglecting that he is making progress through his relationship with Carolyn (Ricci).  Pumpkin is not allowed to grow up. His sexual stirrings horrify his mother and she punishes him for masturbating even though he is a grown man.  This depicts the stereotype of mentally retarded people being asexual.  These handicapped people are often thought not to be able to handle a sexual relationship or be capable of sexual attraction.  Obviously Pumpkin is capable of these feelings so we are left with two choices; Pumpkin is not really handicapped, or handicapped people are able to have sexual thoughts and feelings. These stereotypes and male perspective are brought forward through certain alienation effects such as  Carolyn's sudden complete change of heart, the one sidedness of her sorority sisters, incredible acts such as explosions that do not harm those involved, and the unbelievable relationship between Pumpkin and Carolyn's ex-boyfriend.  These exaggerated and incredible aspects of the film make us wake up from the plot and interpret what issues in our world are being examined.  Or the acting might just be really bad. Although many of us would be quick to dismiss this movie as unentertaining or unrealistic, that is the point of the movie.  When something isn't realistic, we ask ourselves why.  In this case, Pumpkin is unrealistic because it oversimplifies many groups of people; an act we commit when describing many races, cultures, and economic and social statuses.  We are faced with a reflection of how we generalize sorority girls and the mentally retarded and we realize that there must be another side of the story. This reflection also shows how we, and others, define our identities from how we are classified; by race, class, gender, sexuality, and many other properties.  It also leads us to see that many of these generalizations are false.

It seems several commentators here actually took the movie at face value, and thought it a straight-faced romance between a privileged sorority member (Ms. Ricci who, arguably, plays it so brilliantly straight-faced, the audience can't help but be left off balance) and a mentally- and physically-handicapped boy whose quiet suffering inspires our heretofore self-indulgent protagonist to take stock in herself, and look beyond the shallow limits of her egocentric worldview.  For the first 10 or 15 minutes of this movie, it is understandable to think that it is nothing more than a big-screen production of an afterschool special.  Not long thereafter, though, Pumpkin's tone is uncut camp.  Pumpkin is NOT black comedy, a genre marked by subtle undercurrents of the macabre that allow its audiences the occasional uncomfortable laughs, but in which larger and decidedly UN-funny themes are at the heart of the movie.  (See Todd Stolenz's Happiness) Pumpkin does not address weighty issues, it lampoons those who do.  Ricci's Carolyn comes about as close to self-understanding as Halley's Comet does to this planet once every 76 years (a scant 39 million miles on April 11, 1986).

It could be artistic genius, or it could be a group of writers, directors and sound guys who just do not know what they are doing.If the film was indeed intended to be artistic, then the acting was not so bad because most of the most of the actors can be excused for not adding depth to their performances. The fact that the actors who play the two lead roles, Pumpkin and Kent, actually do lend better than stereotypical performances to this film, however, makes one wonder just how intention was the suckiness provided by the other actors.Overall, however, his was a decent film that keeps audiences watching, and the filmmakers should be commended for doing a movie on this particular subject. Sadly, when we see films centered on mental illness, they usually involve some rare disease unknown to most people. While I do respect the fact that those movies are made to increase awareness on those diseases, I would like to see more films made about those people like Pumpkin who just have basic mental retardation.The film could have been better if they had treated this subject more seriously.

Carolyn's unease in dealing with a handicapped person is eventually replaced by compassion, then love; and Carolyn soon discovers the consequences of  her `forbidden' love for Pumpkin as her world is quickly turned upside down. David Harris is terrific as the title character. He carefully treads the narrow line between being simply sweetly misunderstood and repulsively geeky. Pumpkin apparently suffers from fairly mild cerebral palsy, so his physical evolution is reasonably convincing, in a `wishful thinking sort of way. One of my nephews has CP, and he has shown terrific improvement in the last two or three years, since he grew up. So I can believe the `love of a good woman' could bring the kind of progress we see in `Pumpkin'.After some initial flat line readings, Christina Ricci settles into her `Carolyn rich bitch' character quite comfortably. Her exasperation at her new found feelings are quite believable.  I'm married to a handicapped athlete, and every emotion Carolyn articulates I felt at one time or another early in my relationship with my wife.One of the best things pointed out by `Pumpkin' is the prejudice experienced by pretty much everyone born with crippling birth defects.  While attending school, both my wife and my nephew were placed in `special' education classes along with moderate to severely `mentally challenged' children. Just because someone can't walk, hear, see, or is mildly spastic, doesn't make them `retarded,' and this whole `special' thing is a well meaning but condescending manner of categorizing people. I've partied with players on a `quadriplegic rugby team' (imagine!), and these guys are just as crude, horny, etc. as any other bunch of male sports jocks.As I said, `Pumpkin' runs too long and could lose a good fifteen to twenty minutes.  WARNING - SPOILER Carolyn's boyfriend becomes paralyzed after a near fatal automobile accident and eventually coaches Pumpkin's team.  Though such `deathbed conversions' do happen, it strains credibility of a movie that's already bursting at the scenes with `good intentions' and wishful thinking. NOTE TO PRODUCER CHRISTINA RICCI  It's MUCH better NOT to show an automobile accident than to present an unconvincing one. Cars generally don't explode from hitting guardrails and BEFORE they strike the ground. More importantly, if someone DOES survive such an accident, they are burned beyond recognition unless they escape the vehicle before it explodes. Carolyn's boyfriend doesn't appear to have so much as a scratch.In any event, `Pumpkin' is worth seeing, and, for those of us with the personal experiences to appreciate its deeper meanings, it's a very worthwhile movie. Check it out.  "},{"Title":"GENIUS","Date":"20 August 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  This movie is frickin great and remains one of my favorites.

Pumpkin fits in perfectly to a wonderful little genre of films like Ghost World and My First Mister. If only every fifth film were as good and sweet as this little flawed gem... Oh, that'd be so wonderful.While many aspects of the plot are wholly unoriginal, the film really works. While it is true, there are portions of the movie that aren't perfectly polished, I just didn't mind. I was worried the ending wasn't going to go where it should, and thankfully my fears didn't materialize. Seen in pieces, that is seeing each scene as individual and separate from the whole, this isn't a terrific film, but when the pieces go together, as with the movie experience, it definitely becomes more than the sum of it parts. A sweet fable, a silly comedy along with something to think about.Christina Ricci and Hank Harris are a great screen couple. Sam Ball also deserves a round of applause for his performance! Bravo Sam! This film was so enjoyable, it reminded me of films like `Revenge Of The Nerds', `Election' and the terrific `Ray Bradbury's The Wonderful Ice-Cream Suit'. When you need a lift a good romantic comedy always does the trick, this one does the trick, and puts a little twist on the usual formula! If you enjoyed `Pumpkin' look for an obscure romantic comedy called `Paperback Romance', starring real life husband and wife team Gia Carides and Anthony LaPaglia. To all those `Pumkin' boosters out there, &#145;I love you'. To all the Pumpkin haters I say &#145;too bad your so sad.'Here's hoping the producers release a SPECIAL EDITION with a commentary track!

I put off watching this one along time though, which is unusual for a sky blue flavored indie Ricci flick...something I would normally tear off the shelves and make a run for the door with.  But I don't know, the subject matter didn't interest me that much.  Fortunately I finally took the trouble to see it and I just know it's going to be one of those films I'll annoy people with trying to talk about. This is a good film, the writing is so smart it's astonishing.  It switches genres a lot, but in a subtle way that seems really natural....you just have to go with it, there are ridiculous bits intentionally, but that's part of what makes movies so great...exaggeration. It's a sweet film that obviously owes a lot to Romeo and Juliet, the characters are drawn in pretty astonishing ways...at first they're all stereotypical, but even the most superficial of them gets a chance at some point to be really human.  The screenwriter and director was quite generous there.  I was pretty dang impressed, and it was a fun ride at the same time.  Highly recommended.  Christina Ricci was fantastic as always, and the guy playing her boyfriend, the Paris character (not the Romeo character) was just brilliant.  He should be the next Cary Elwes, except that his humor was actually more subtle and more ridiculous at the same time.  Like I said it switches genres, but what a fun picture...I liked the comment here that mentioned it should have been a musical.  It has that feel to it sometimes.  I wouldn't have minded a couple of dance numbers...and if you're a person that really doesn't like that kind of thing...maybe this isn't quite the film for you...but maybe it is.  It's just a movie to let yourself go at and let it be what it is. Kudos to the filmmakers if anyone involved in the project happens to ever read this.  I was very impressed.

"},{"Title":"Misguided, as clever as it is.","Date":"31 May 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Some spoilers  The makers of this movie clearly spent about a collective 10 minutes studying a) the mentally challenged, b) sororities, c) the law, and d) filmmaking.  All of this is easy to overlook, due to the overwhelming witticism and self-acknowledging irony cudgeling you brutally about the head right through the end.  I know, I know, many critics love the sensibility that in today's era, who says a movie has to be ABOUT something?  Fine.  A movie, like this one, does NOT need a purpose, or an objective, or consistency, or to be anything but clever.  Filmmakers delight in not giving viewers what they're expecting, and I'm all in favor of that.  But this movie is clever only insofar as the deeply uneducated can ever be.  If you're going to be purposeless, at least be informed - at least know what you're talking about.  This film seems to suffer from the misapprehension that if you're FUNNY you don't have to be RIGHT.  It isn't true.  Many people have commented on the sensitivity with which the handicapped characters are treated - commending the screenwriters for arguing that the mentally challenged have feelings too.  I would hope that in this day and age this isn't something we have to be told, and would argue that a large part of the reason this is common knowledge is due to GOOD films that deal with the mentally ill or handicapped (see Awakenings, or Rain Man.  Really.)  I would also argue that the handicapped people in Pumpkin are treated as carelessly and shamefully as any movie I've seen.  They are treated as set pieces, as an emotive device to hide the film's complete lack of awareness.  Argue that Pumpkin is never even diagnosed in order to challenge our system of classification and assignment.  Go on.  As near as I can tell, Pumpkin is not so much handicapped as he is overwhelmingly lazy.  His transformation by the end of the movie, while not complete- as the last shot signifies- is absurd to the point of obscenity.  That a handicapped young man could be wheelchair-bound and near-catatonic in the beginning and winning a marathon race and spouting aphorisms on the nature of pain by the end is an insult to the people who spend their lives trying to help challenged teens.  Obviously we're not supposed to like or dislike any of the characters - they're all flawed and human and satires of themselves, and in a movie this clever, that's expected.  This film had many tremendously clever scenes, dealing with the concepts of beauty, wealth, sororities, social charity, suicide, sex, and other popular targets, and these scenes are, indeed, laugh-out-loud funny.  So it's that much more unfortunate that the movie's makers chose to make a movie about something they so clearly do not understand.  As a straight social satire, ignoring the ENTIRE Pumpkin plotline, this could have been a great movie.  As it is, they've named the movie after and centered the film on its weakest plot point.  Are we supposed to believe that Carolyn has learned anything by the end?  She obviously knows no more about the handicapped, or Pumpkin's particular situation, in the end than she does at the beginning.  Are we to believe that her efforts, while misguided, are forgivable because they were well-intentioned?  They are not.  She hasn't thought about anything.  She brings a wheelchair-bound boy to the beach (ever try to push a wheelchair on sand?) to play volleyball and hopefully make a love connection with Carolyn's charity-case friend, somehow equating the loneliness of an overweight young woman surrounded by beautiful people with the biological short-circuitry that caused Pumpkin's situation, whatever that is.  But it's cool, because this isn't a movie about a character who learns anything, or who grows, or who does anything in particular of any note.  Christina Ricci attempted a similar character (one who is incapable of empathy or redemption) in The Opposite of Sex, and that's fine.  As a modern audience, we can appreciate that not everything is about anything.  But at least you can be accurate.  I hated The Other Sister for similar reasons that despite good intentions, the screenwriters insisted on having the handicapped characters wax philosophical about the nature of their disorders.  Happy or not, there is such a thing as a person who is incapable of overcoming the obstacles that have been put in their way.  But the way Pumpkin's writers treat the handicapped is just abusive.  I fear that some people who will see this movie will think that Pumpkin's transformation can happen in real life.  It can't, unless I was right, and he's just been malingering for his first sixteen years, enjoying the comfort that being considered a vegetable has afforded him.This movie is pure fantasy.  There is nothing of any value attached to the plot - all scenes with any humorous value have nothing to do with Pumpkin.  The car crash, the suicide attempt, the sorority recruiting scenes, are all as tongue-in-cheek funny as they can be.  But as much as the movie IS about anything, it's not about these scenes, which is regrettable.  I'm amazed that Roger Ebert, someone who is usually aware that being clever is not enough to make a good movie, gave this movie three and a half stars.  He originally claimed that he would only give movies zero stars if they were, not necessarily badly made, but actually damaging to the people who saw them.  This movie has nothing good to offer other than a few laughs, and has the potential to dramatically undermine people's ability to understand the handicapped.  People might actually think this movie's ideas are serious.  At least movies like Scary Movie or Very Bad Things are obviously satire, and leave others (What's Eating Gilbert Grape or Rain Man) to set the record straight.  I give this movie my most vehement zero stars, because it was bursting with intelligence and creativity and visual style, and it was all ruined because the writer wouldn't spend an afternoon at the library.  A movie cannot be both purposeless and uninformed.  The filmmakers should be ashamed that some people took their movie seriously.

I left this movie with the realization that the world isnt perfect but you can still make life a personally great experience. This movie is a satire and alot of people might interpret the irreverance of a satire based on this subject matter a bit taboo or innapropriate. This movie is not for the thin skinned. It also isnt for the sympatetic/empathetic pseudo-intellectuals that think they enjoy independant movies. This is for the true intellectual that can read in between the lines and knows when to take some situations literally and others figuratively. Example being... I liken the people that took this movie to offense to the character of Cici. She was more than offended when Carolyn tried to hook her up with Pumpkin and she just couldnt see past the poor delivery to the inherently good intentions Carolyn had. This movie was very touching for me because there was so much vulnerability in each and every character. You could feel, even empathize with every man characters pain. Carolyns realization that life isnt as peachy as she might have imagined. Pumpkins battes with his inadequacy as a person with slight and I say slight mental retardation. Kents wounded heart and pride after being dumped for Pumpkin... The list goes on. But I feel the most important subject to touch on that this movie stressed was that Carolyn treated Pumpkin like a normal person and he blossomed. Its something we should keep in mind.

I think the reason that a lot of people found it 'pointless' or 'offensive' was because the director didn't dumb anything down for us; he let us come to realizations on our own (and I like that in a movie).It is a controversial movie. I think that the particular disability of the character 'Pumpkin' is made purposefully vague (and is never given a name) so as not to make those of us who know a lot about a particular disabilities feel the need to point out mistakes or to say to ourselves 'that could never happen to *my* disabled loved one, I am offended/this movie is stupid' and such. In my experience with disabled folks (my little sister included), the fact is that there are millions of disabilities, and each has a broad range of severities.  We, as people, have have much to learn about the vast range of disabled psyches. So it seems obvious to me that the character Pumpkin cannot serve as a representative of all disabled people, nor do I think he was meant to.Rather, 'Pumpkin' is a story about these *particular* characters, and how they affect each other; I think it is a good story. It deals with a taboo topic, and does so with both compassion and humor.  The style is unique and interesting, the acting is wonderful, and I think the movie got a very undeserved bad rap.  I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and think, whether or not you have a  disabled loved one; whether or not you know anything about the topic.

This does not mean that the film is an accurate portrayal of all Greek students, any more than it is an accurate portrayal of mental challenges. But it does teach us something about both.The only scene I found entirely too implausible was the car crash. The car could not have gone that fast, the driver would not have been in such an old car, and it would not have exploded three times on its way down. I think that scene was spliced in from an older movie. Finally, had the accident occurred as shown, the driver would not have recovered -- face intact -- so quickly.

PUMPKIN hit me on that personal level. Therefore I had to sit back and fully realize that the satire is good enough to get a review that is surely better than that of another HALLOWEEN sequel.To win Sorority of the Year, AOPi begin a charity helping mentally challenged athletes succeed, but trouble brews when the star sister falls for one of the athletes.Personal feelings aside, PUMPKIN was cleverly pulled off, with excellent acting by Ricci and Ball. And the satire was a definite plus for people who caught on. The character of Anne Chung made me laugh while I was nearly rolling on the floor when Kent drove off the rail and the car blew up in all directions. But with the dry and biting wit, PUMPKIN still overdid the satire. The poetry class was easy to pick up on the joke, but they did not stop. Same goes for the rivalry with Hansie.

It is not for everyone and not everyone gets it.  Consider the scene on the beach where the character of Carolyn runs to Pumpkin after she realizes she has left him there. First of all, the situation is so absurd, it's brilliant.  Then, Pumpkin tells Carolyn she's the smartest girl he's ever met.  We don't know whether to laugh or cry.  There is a whacked-out romanticism about the film which is completely endearing. In fact, so much of Pumpkin seems to be a joke and not a joke at the same time. That's what I found to be so wonderful about it.  It retains that tone throughout the entire film.I'm not aware of a film in the last couple years that has inspired so much passion for and against it, especially amongst my friends.

Pumpkin is chock full of wonderfully ironic and ultimately absurd moments, such as Carolyn forgetting, not once, but twice, that she had left Pumpkin (Hank Harris) at the beach.

I will say that Christina Ricci looked beautiful and that the boy who played Pumpkin was a good actor.  Unfortunately, I feel I'm giving him extra credit because everything else in this movie was just so incredibly horrible.  To start with plot points that make this movie unbearable, there's the often-mentioned blowing up car scene in which Catherine's boyfriend escapes paralyzed but unscratched.  Not only is this incredibly unbelievable, but it had nothing to do with the movie other than to, supposedly, show him what it felt like to be in Pumpkin's shoes.  Um, help me if I'm the only one that noticed this, but Pumpkin was retarded and could walk, and the boyfriend (sorry, I just saw the movie and can't remember his name) ends up in perfectly fine mental health and paralyzed.  I really don't see the connection.  OK, also, who the heck is stupid enough to completely forget that they left someone on the beach?  That's insane.  I could go on and on, about the completely random scene where she swallowed all those drugs and survived, about why Kent (that's his name!) became a coach (?) for the Challenged Athlete's team, about what the deal was with the stupid bug in salad, but it's kind of painful to think about.  As for running problems with this movie  1.  The acting sucked.  Even Christina Ricci.  With the exception of Pumpkin (by the way, they never explained the meaning of his name at all), every single character in this movies acted excruciatingly absurd, especially Kent.  This guy was worse than any actor in any movie I've ever seen.  He makes me think of an elementary school play.  I'm /not/ joking.  2.  The cinematography sucked.  There were weird random close-ups that made the whole thing feel fake (as if other aspects didn't do that enough) and made me really uncomfortable.  3.  The casting sucked.  The people casted were just so completely far-fetched, including Pumpkin, that I couldn't handle it.  I mean, the woman who plays Suki on Gilmore Girls as a depressed psychomaniac?  I'll admit, she tried really hard, but she doesn't fit at all.  Neither does anyone else.  4.  Finally, the whole plot, the continuity, the theme, none of it was coherent.  Anyone who thought this movie was deep was seeing something that wasn't there, kind of like when you have a crush on a movie star because you feel like you know them or something.  There were so many scenes in this movie that could have been edited out because they just didn't have anything to do with anything.  There were entire characters that could have been edited out and it wouldn't have even mattered - like the professor.  And what was the deal with him falling to one knee after she left?  What was up with the weird hippie people?  Why would Kent /ever/ want Catherine back?  How did Pumpkin learn to walk and talk so well by the end of the movie when he couldn't even pronounce Catherine's name in the beginning?  How the heck did Pumpkin knock Kent down in the fight scene?  By running into him?  Please!  This movie is so ridiculous that I suggest you /do/ watch it, with a friend!

The story has a lot of comic potential as well as a deeper, darker aspect that could have brought the film to a level of greatness rarely achieved in a sorority film.The direction of the film had its moments; many of its shots truly conveyed the motion, momentum and emotion of the moment, but on the whole it was masacared by the editing.  I was surprised by the amount of blatent, random editing and jarring cuts... the fades were poorly used to shorten many shots while other, better, shots were left at full length.The story wasn't extreme enough to achieve the feeling it was going for, and the contrast between the perfect world and the real world almost didn't exist.  The car crash at the end was so unrealistic it seemed to fit into an extreme version of the film, one that would have truly conveyed the grotesque nature of sorority life.A promising film with rare depth of character, I was really disappointed with the half-realized vision of this movie.

It starts off in typical teen movie fashion with spoiled teens in a sorority house showing the audience how vapid and shallow they are - they worry nothing about the problems of the real world and concern themselves only with having the right charity and new girls to beat their arch enemies in the S.O.Y. contest. At this point you settle in for some 'Animal House' or 'Revenge of the Nerds' type action.** Spoilers **Cue Pumpkin Romanoff, a 'challenged' athlete. He enters the life of Carolyn, one of the sorority sisters and an unlikley connection develops. This budding relationship is painted with such bold strokes it almost borders on farce and you begin to wonder where the director is taking you. However, at no time is Pumpkin the butt of any joke. Instead, we see the supposed 'normal' people around the couple presented as the joke, from the mild (Pumpkin's overprotective mother) to the grotesque (Carolyn's Sorority sisters) all of whom try to break the couple up for their own ends. You begin to wonder who is actually challenged at this point.The second half of the film meanders a little as Carolyn lurches from being in love with Pumpkin to deciding she wants her old life back a couple of times. Eventually the situation comes to a head with Carolyn's spurned jock ex-boyfriend actually beating up her new disabled one in a fight outside the spring formal dance. I could not believe what I was seeing, this single scene is so daring and so open to criticism from more conservative quarters that I actually found myself clapping and cheering the directors. Pumpkin prevails in the fight by chance and the ex is so distraught he promptly has to go out and crash his car in a huge explosion.Since this crash is clearly meant to imply he dies (the car explodes before it gets anywhere near the ground), but we see him in the next scene merely(!) unable to walk we come to realise that the film is at least in part playing with it's tongue firmly in its cheek. It is using a paint roller to fill in the fine detail that other films would have used a tiny brush for.Once you get that you are supposed to view the overplayed events with a wry smile, the film snaps into focus and makes its points very well. What are those points? You should probably work those out for yourself but if you want my $0.02, I got a clear message that just because everybody tells you a thing is wrong, it doesn't make it so. Also that if you believe in something, you shouldn't give up on it.This film is not perfect, for example Carolyns Fat friend is used as a plot device to illustrate how confused Carolyn is when she attempts to set her up with Pumpkin which leads to a row between the friends. We then dont see her again for the rest of the film, which bearing in mind it is telling a story about society's misfits standing up for themselves is a bit of a shame. Many people will simply not get the irony of the film and will feel thay have wasted their time. It just doesn't fit well into any mold you try to put it in. Accept that and you will have a great time though.I'd give it an 8/10. Bravo Abrams and Broder, I look forward to your next project.

What ensues destroys friendships, social networks, and indeed lives.The film does a thorough job of exposing the profound shallowness and cultural bankruptcy of the people who join fraternities and sororities, from the rushees to the current members to the parents who so clearly forced their children to join the same frats they did when they were in college. The A-O-Pi's in the movie drop the charity the minute they realize they've lost the S.O.Y. contest. During rush, the Filipina with Caucasian features and the African American girl are prized pledges for their money and diversity-instilling presence.This film is a wake-up call to everyone who's in a Greek Organization they are being inculcated with racist, classist, and homophobic ideologies, and would probably do themselves a favor by walking out and getting in the real world, where working with people of color and people with disabilities and others with differences from the norm is a big reality.

However the end lead me to believe that the film-makers did not know how to end this story... a general lack of finality to all the social questions upon which it touches. If you are into zany humor, or more importantly, empathize with those who are stuck within their own situations, you will likely enjoy this film.

What started out as satire in the first half turns into a weird overblown farce. I believe two different directors worked on this picture and it shows. I don't agree with the previous reviewer either that the film doesn't make fun of the handicap. It was doing that until the horrible near ending of the movie where a special olympic event goes on.

No, it's not as romantic and believable as Titanic or as brutal about society as Cry Baby was, but that's the whole point of the movie  not being perfect. Nothing is ever just black or just white, which is why this story always kind of makes you wonder and shift between 'Are they for real?' and 'That's such a good point!'.

I don't know, this movie is weird, funny, interesting, sad, it has a criticism for society and people in general, etc. The movie isn't all about the Pumpkin character; it focuses on the selfish Caroline and how she believes the world is at her feet. She has the perfect life friends, money, a family, beauty, she's popular, she has a handsome boyfriend, etc. She's perfect. But her perfect life makes her imperfect. I mean, she believes she can change things in other people's life just because it's her. At some point in the movie she believe she's Cupid , then she believes she can understand REAL pain (not her kind of pain which consists of not getting what she wants in life), and also she believes Pumpkin is suffering a lot while he is happy even with his condition. But the then movie takes a twist and demonstrates how Caroline has changed and finally has understood about people's feelings. Tragic events were necessary for her to become mature. But also, people had to experience terrible situations in order for her to be finally on her two feet (Kent's accident, having sex with Pumpkin, etc.).Her true feelings are really weird... at first she has repulsion for Pumpkin, but then she has symphaty for them which she confuses with compassion. Then she falls in love with him and finally, she has sex with him. What was that all about? I mean, I understand she was confused but changing drastically your feelings and preferences is not normal...something that leads me to believe that she had some kind of sickness that consists of being attracted physically and emotionally for people with special capacities (such as Pumpkin).So in the ending the things get more confusing... she still gets what she wants at other people's cost. Now Kent is invalid, Pumpkin is depressed because of her absence, the sorority house bitches lost their competition, etc. So maybe I didn't get the whole point of the move but that's what it makes it a great viewing experience. The movie throws you many situations for you to make your own conclusion. It also displays some socially incorrect behaviors and also shows displays of humanity and kindness. At some points I thought this was cheap exploitation and mockery for people like Pumpkin. Then I changed my mind and thought this was a dark comedy for teens. Then I believed it was a movie to display how disturbed a rich girl can be... The truth is that I enjoyed the whole movie and after it's ending, I came to the conclusion that you just have to make your interpretation of the movie. So I can say that Pumpkin is a movie that makes a critic against society and how it treats people like Pumpkin, but also demonstrates how this people are happy even with their situation. Also I came up with the conclusion that the movie tries to exploit the Caroline character. It's all about her and her development. Which I believe it's a very interesting, dark character.Christina Ricci's performance is simply great, she's at her best in this one. She can be tender, naive, bitchy, but also can demonstrate she is in pain, or that she can be blinded by love or confusion. Pumpkin was a great character and the actor who portrayed him was also at his best. The rest of the cast is okay. The direction is simple but fast paced. Pumpkin is a visually stunning and attractive movie. The soundtrack is perfect for the events. You can't get a better soundtrack in my opinion. The technical aspects of the movie should be treated apart as this movie focuses on the plot development instead.

But in the movie Omega is substituted for Omicron. This little detail pretty much sums up this little film. Pumpkin ALMOST crosses the legal, politically correct, and taboo topic line many times but always stops short. Unable to decide if it wants to be a satire, a political commentary, or a serious message movie it waffles back and forth. All this is very frustrating plus it's never a good idea to flaunt where you could have gone had you not gutlessly backed off.The result is far less satisfying than if the screenwriter had just maintained a consistent direction. For example, the satire elements actually work pretty well. The visual imagery of films is spoofed as sorority girl Ricci's first bump on the road of life is followed by a montage of imperfection-rats, decaying garbage, a dead bird, etc. which have always been there but which she is just seeing for the first time. Then there are the repeated condescending references to the Chinese sorority sister. And Ricci's attempted suicide using the entire contents of the medicine cabinet, including contact lens solution and Pepto-bismol. Good bits that let you know this thing is being played for laughs but far too isolated to turn the movie into a good satire or to even convince you that it is a satire.Toward the end you begin to wonder where they can go with this thing. Which they must have wondered too because the last 30 minutes seems thoughtless tacked on to provide some kind resolution for a direct-to-video release that would get back at least some of the production costs. Actually this thing had a theatrical release but was pulled after a few weeks when it failed to generate much interest. It did about $300,000 at the box office and I am not leaving off any zeros.Christina Ricci fans probably should check this out. She plays the same sorority airhead as Reese Witherspoon did in Legally Blonde and Witherspoon's acting is pretty sorry by comparison. Actually most of the execution is good and Marisa Coughlin is ravishing as the sorority president who throws one of the best hissy fits in film history. Four years after staring in Girl, Dominique Swain has a moderate size part as Ricci's roommate. Appearance-wise those four years were not kind. If you have always wondered what it would be like to combine elements of Rainman, Lucas, and Breaking Away into the same movie, Pumpkin shows you why that would be a bad idea.

The message in this film is a very stern, and yet it is presented in a hilarious manner. There are so many times I laughed out loud.

How to accept and appreciate the good qualities of someone who is different from the norm. It is also about the inner beauty. As one of the lines says,  Suffering makes you beautiful. I cannot agree more on this when I was watching the film. It is the acceptance and support for each other that enables us to appreciate each others. Though this, the world will become a much better place.There are so many scenes where one would stop and think 'oh his/her behaviour is so disgusting' and then the viewer would also ponder 'are there times that I am like that too?'.

I'll admit freely that I wasn't sure when I was supposed to laugh and when to be moved; you could read this as a brave commingling of comedy and pathos, or as the bungling of a group of filmmakers who, in their genre-bending, learned more from Ed Wood than Almodovar.When a movie is supposed to be confusing and laughable, it gives us the worst of both worlds. The comedy is sabotaged by the ham-handed drama, and the ham-handed drama is stripped of any emotional weight. I was reminded of the terrible Bruce Willis comedy-drama, 'The Story of Us,' which also teetered between chuckles and high drama.However, I have a suspicion that 'Pumpkin' wasn't intended to be bad, or simply a joke on its audience. I do believe that it was intended to move us, and that it fails so miserably is a testament to the complacency and lack of talent of its makers.As a final note the fact that 'Pumpkin' polarizes and confuses people is not a sign of its daring. Yes, daring films, like 'Eraserhead' and 'Fight Club' evoke strong and ambiguous reactions. But so does 'I Spit on Your Grave,' and no one is arguing for the boldness of the latter.

The writers of the film clearly have no grasp on how to make  a cohesive story.

Pumpkin's mother at first was portrayed as a caring mom who had done a great deal to help and encourage Pumpkin. By the end of this mess she is portrayed as heartless and misunderstanding. The scenes of the special games were completely offensive and were obviously used for cheap laughs.      Also the fact that the filmmakers do not show the love scene between Pumpkin and Caroline but they choose to show Kent having sex shows that they could not poignantly portray a real romance between the two characters and that the story was all based on improbable whim and unlikelihood.

It's disconcerting, but the originality and the growing emotional charge take the viewer along a great fall into grace. The opening is set on a campus designed to look like a 50's nightmare, with inconsistent Barbie dolls and square faced Ken bachelors. In this futile world, the arrival of disabled athletes who are there to be trained by sorority members on their charity time has the effect of war pictures in a Disney movie. It's a definite wake-up call for one of the Barbie dolls, played by the excellent Christina Ricci, and the start of a series of misunderstandings and moments of grace. Both her character and the one of the challenged boy seem to come out of their bubble to fall into each other's arms, her because she needs to find truth in this world that is new to her eyes, and him to persuade himself that he is not dreaming awake. The story telling then finds its way through awful situations as the society points at the two lovers, and funny and spirited black humor has the weak ones take their revenge on the beautiful people. Marilyn Manson would love it!

I'm sure glad I did, because I would have never seen it otherwise. Judging from the photo on the box (which is always a bad idea), this did not look like the type of movie I would ever be interested in.Since I didn't know anything about this movie, I have to admit I was 20 minutes into it before I realized it was a dark comedy. At that point, it just clicked, and was even better the second time around.For those of you who liked Harold and Maude or Being There (as I did), you will probably really like this. If you watch it at face value you may find it cheesy, or even insulting to your intelligence, which is what makes this movie so hilarious and cleverly ironic. It mocks what it is.That said, I don't think I need to outline the story, as many reviewers have already done that. All I really should say is the humor is really dry and dark, so beware. I especially enjoyed the way the story ridicules social conformity and addresses some of life tribulations, without being nauseating or PC. The actors (and director) were brilliant, and if you like modern alternate folk music, you'll love the soundtrack.The last time finished watching a movie and thought to myself, wow, what a surprise, that was really great, was the first time I saw Rushmore.

But, whereas Waters' characters tend to take themselves seriously with an overtone of audacity if not hyperbole, these characters ran the gamut of serious to seriously unbelievable. **Possible Spoilers**Carolyn (Christina Ricci) falls for Special Olympics participant Pumpkin (Hank Harris) because of his inner beauty. Before that, she was the epitome of everything we hated about college sorority queen with the perfect hair, perfect friends, and a perfectly athletic frat house boyfriend (Sam Ball). With the right touch, this could be one big shocking satire. Instead, I found myself disturbed by what I was seeing. It never could decide what it wanted to be. It wasn't a farce, it wasn't a black comedy, it wasn't a drama, and it wasn't satire...yet, from scene to scene, it had elements of all of the above, making it very unbalanced.Being a huge Brenda Blethyn fan, I thought she was wonderful in her part...but, grossly underused. Hank Harris as Pumpkin was very believable, maybe too believable. Sam Ball as jilted boyfriend Kent, along with Dominique Swain, Marisa Coughlan, and Michelle Krusiec as Carolyn's snobby sorority sisters played their one note stereotypes so convincingly throughout that their changed attitudes toward the end of the film seemed forced and storybook. Kent's tragic accident provided his transformation, however this is one of the most laughable plot twists the story has. Melissa McCarthy's overweight Cici (an ill-fated love connection for Pumpkin early in the film) was perhaps the most interesting character in what turned out to be little more than a cameo role.My biggest problem was that of Ricci's Carolyn. She went back and forth between stereotype and full of depth...and it was a sloppy transition. In the end, it would have been a whole hell of a lot more interesting for her to give Pumpkin up, but, that wasn't the case.I would have loved to have seen where this film could have gone had John Waters been in charge...but, I guess we'll never know.

Here, the girl is about as superficial and self-absorbed as they come, until confronted with a semi-retarded and physically handicapped boy of her age named Pumpkin.  Others in her life, including one of her teachers, and eventually even her boyfriend, take her to task for having an empty mind, concerned with nothing more than her social status.  Not wanting to be thought of solely in such trivial terms, however, she imagines that she can discover something deeper in herself by reaching out in greater breadth, or, in other words, to the extent that she becomes more involved with Pumpkin, that means that she is also becoming a deeper and more caring person.Unfortunately, however, she merely replaces an obsession with social status by a compulsion with Pumpkin, like the alcoholic who becomes addicted to AA meetings, with the result that while her focus may have changed, her level of involvement remains equivalently superficial.  She can't get the depth through the breadth alone, but she doesn't understand that, which drives her fixation with Pumpkin to absurd extremes.  And indeed, this film never gets that point either, as it leads us to believe that she is actually developing a deeper and more meaningful character through her fascination with Pumpkin.  It might seem nice that a girl such as she could fall in love with a boy such as he, but this one trivializes the basis for a relationship in terms hardly favorable to either.

Her dealings with the handicapped individual to whom she is assigned, a crippled and mentally retarded wheel chair athlete (his nickname of Pumpkin is the origin of the title) are supposed to be the life changing catalyst through which she sees the hollow existence she had previously led. That sounds OK for a Hallmark Afterschool Special, but is considerably less effective as the set up for a comedy- which this film purports to be. Pumpkin seems to start off as a satire, with Christina Ricci (appearing as a bleached blonde) presented as the most popular sister at her UCLA sorority, though no evidence of why this should be is given.  The rival sorority is shown as populated entirely by tall attractive blonde women. This is rather humorous, but it's also that last funny moment in the movie. Christina's boyfriend is the star tennis player of the school, and the envy of all, naturally.  At this point, he would have been shown to be a boorish fop (as all popular high school and college athletes must be in Movieland) but he is actually revealed to be more considerate than Christina, criticizing her for attempting to fix-up the wheelchair bound retarded boy (who cannot articulate well)with an overweight friend of hers for a day at the beach. The parts of the movie that should show Pumpkin to be a sensitive and caring individual (central to this plot) are virtually ignored.  The movie hits its lowest point when Christina sneaks into his room to spend the night with (and have sex) the cripple retarded boy.  (Imagine just for a moment if the sexes were reversed for this little plot twist- a fraternity boy having sex with a crippled retarded girl). The humor apparently is supposed to derive from the outrage of the sorority girl dropping her hunky jock fraternity boyfriend for an inappropriate person.  Humor at the expense of the handicapped is Adam Sandler's specialty, but at least he is up front about it. The movie is just too idiotic continue describing; a fistfight between the crippled retarded boy (miraculously now without his wheelchair) and the college athlete ending up with the humiliating defeat of the tennis star who outweighs him by at least 50 pounds; a spectacular mid-air car explosion and crash which leaves the tennis player wheelchair bound but somehow otherwise unscratched; and a relay race won by the erstwhile crippled boy at the climax of the Special Olympics.  The final joke seems to be that Christina comes to the realization that Pumpkin really is, after all, mentally retarded, with a final panicked look into the camera as the movie fades out. Hilarious.  This movie tries too hard to be clever and satirical and ends up instead a mismatched mess of banalities and moralizations.  In short, this pumpkin is rotten.

'Pumpkin' is partly a satire of sel'-satisfied upperclass American girls, and it is being compared to 'Heathers,' which begins as a satire of such girls in a posh high school.However 'Heathers' is a much wittier movie than 'Pumpkin'--and it turns dark and apocalyptic at the end, which is a successful combination. Pumpkin's parts aren't as compatible. Half the time the movie is mocking sorority girls, and half the time it's celebrating the relationship between Carolyn and the challenged, but sweet, boy, Pumpkin (Hank Harris, a gifted physical actor with an expressive face who deserves at least as much credit as Ricci for whatever memorable qualities this oddly skewed movie achieves). Both 'Pumpkin' and Nicole Holofcener's 'Lovely and Amazing,' which is about a group of women in a family and a little girl, and which came out around the same time as 'Pumpkin,' belong to a class of new movies that could be called Todd Solondz Lite.These milder Solondz clones are edgy, bitter, satirical, disturbing &#x96; but a lot less so than 'Happiness' or 'Storytelling.' They come on at times as light romantic comedy, but then it becomes obvious that something is terribly wrong. In a way they only make sense by comparison with an extremist like Solondz. They switch around among genres and moods, ranging from the cynical to the passionately sincere. Sometimes they're fun, and sometimes they're distinctly not fun. All this works better in Pumpkin,' because of its unifying plot, which is half offbeat love story and half coming of age story, than it does in the directionless 'Lovely and Amazing.'Casting gives the movie edge because it's already a kick to see Adams Family girl Ricci playing a perfect blonde sorority sister. 'Lovely and Amazing' has no emotional core. Mostly it just seems disjointed and a bit depressing. It could be called Three Women and a Girl in Search of a Plot. Pumpkin has a very definite plot, an elaborate one, full of disasters narrowly evaded or somehow capitalized upon, a bit like something John Waters might cook up. (Brenda Blethyn performs admirably in both movies, by the way.)And more than funny or witty, 'Pumpkin' is moving. It's touching in a raw way how the retarded boy blossoms physically and emotionally because of his love of Carolyn, and her learning to appreciate this love makes Carolyn become a real person and shuck off her sorority girl persona. The movie is emotionally powerful despite all the mockery--it actually made me cry at the end--but it also seems confused. Sometimes being challenged is treated very tastefully, but there are also times when the retarded boys seem cartoonish, as does Carolyn's perfect tennis star boyfriend, Kent Woodlands (Samuel Ball), who goes back and forth between heroic good guy and comic cardboard stereotype. It seems obvious that with their contemporary sensibilities the filmmakers couldn't have allowed themselves the sincerity without the strong dose of cynicism and satire to frame it, but in old fashioned terms their emotions are all over the map at once. 'Pumpkin' isn't as amateurish-seeming and unnerving as Miguel Arteta's 'Chuck and Buck,' but I thought of that picture too. You desperately want to hate 'Chuck and Buck,' or at least I do, but you have to admit it has an original, disturbing premise -- the dense and utterly homely gay guy who tracks down and hounds the successful straight guy he played around with sexually when they were kids. Alone, these movies just leave you puzzled, but together 'Pumpkin' and 'Lovely and Amazing' and 'Chuck and Buck' all begin to make some kind of sense. They represent a new generation of filmmakers who don't really believe in irony any more because it's been so often thrust upon them and cheapened by Madison Avenue that it's lost all its attraction. But their minds are still full of irony &#x96; it's just out of kilter now. It's more like embarrassment, with a strong dose of alienation. These are the feelings they live with and seek to evoke. (A more unifed example and a fuller artistic success would be 'Ghost World.')This results in movies that are hard to pin down as to genre. A mixture of genres is fine--when it works. It doesn't quite work in most of these new movies. Is there any such thing as a pure comedy? Not nowadays, it seems. That wouldn't be cool. Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder, who wrote and directed 'Pumpkin,' are young guys who instinctively bend genres. For some of us, it's hard to see how you can reconcile some of the elements in 'Pumpkin,' but you have to admit it moves into new territory. Solondz would have shown Pumpkin and Carolyn making love; Adams and Broder choose not to. That's what makes them Solondz Lite.UPDATE. Unfortunately, 'Pumpkin' tanked critically and commercially and Abrams and Broder haven't made any more movies. Both Roger Ebert and Jonathan Rosenbaum praised 'Pumpkin' and Rosenbaum has just rerun his review in 2010) and he pointed out that the filmmakers' play with believability and genre-bending was intentional; they called it genrefication. I can in fact rarely remember being jerked around and caught up short as effectively while watching a film as I am by 'Pumpkin.' It really makes us reconsider our social assumptions in very visceral terms. Maybe it's not so Lite after all.

Carolyn McDuffy (a blond Christina Ricci) is part of an overprivileged Southern California State University sorority that, simply for the shallow purpose of being named Sorority of the Year, sucks up to a Special Olympics-style charity they otherwise could care less about. As the two factions congregate for the first time, Carolyn encounters an enigmatic wheelchair-bound teenager (Hank Harris) known simply as Pumpkin. At first repulsed by his presence, she finds herself becoming increasingly attracted to his soul, his physical form notwithstanding, but their budding affinity alienates their trite friends and families. The energetic setup of the plot results in smart comedy, especially when Carolyn and Pumpkin first meet, but in screenwriter/co-director Adam Larson Broder's hectic script, the momentum comes to a halt in the second act, in which the film becomes a hodgepodge of forgettable dialogue, abrupt satire, and impertinent subplotting (a meaningless poetry class), all cast under a darker air. Though the acting is sensational &#150; deadpan-stare mistress Ricci winds up carrying the picture on the strength of her best role since the notorious Wednesday of the Addams Family movies, as she mugs her way through a heartfelt performance that at times results in awesome laughs while Harris portrays the eponymous handicapped youth with aplomb &#150; the strong supporting cast loses steam quickly (most notably the great Brenda Blethyn, who has little to do here as Pumpkin's overbearing alcoholic mother). In short, Pumpkin's most conspicuous flaw is that it suffers from an identity crisis. It's a continuous toss-up of whether it wants to be an earnest comedy regarding the evils of political correctness, or a violent live cartoon replete with exorbitant car crashes and silly fistfights, thus rendering any message of morality down for the count.  7/10 "},{"Title":"Risky film that is D.O.A.","Date":"28 June 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Pumpkin  (starring Christina Ricci)  by Wink WilliamsChristina Ricci's name on the poster?

One of the most talented and daring actors of her generation having appeared in and shone in both 'Buffalo 66' and 'Opposite of Sex,' among her many credits, Pumpkin appeared to be another risky choice.   Sadly, this one goes in the minus column. Christina plays Caroline, a perky, blonde, sorority girl with the plucky personality of a sparrow on acid.  We first see her in the films most successful sequence as she and her sisters perform a hula dance in front of the greek house during rush week.  Christina's character is the perkiest of the gals, no easy feet when they all make Sally Field and Mary Hart appear dour in comparison.  The gals plot to win sorority of the year and come up with a winning plan.  A charitable move that will move that will sway the judges in their favor.  They agree to train the competitors for the local Special Olympics. Ricci's Caroline is assigned to work with Pumpkin.  A wheelchair bound, listless male who's been labeled retarded.  She is frightened of him at first and fearful.  She shares her thoughts with her roommate, Jeanine, played by Dominique (Lolita, 1997) Swain.

He is very taken with her and clearly develops feelings for her.  Strangely, and much to her chagrin, Caroline comes to the realization that she has feelings for him. What will her perfect, snobbish parents say?  How will the cliquish, conformist girls of her sorority react?  What will the chipped beef boyfriend, frat type, perfect athlete do?  How could this happen to her?It sounds like an interesting premise but falls flat in every single way. Pumpkin is the most troubling of the characters.  His disabilities are treated like minor inconveniences that can be overcome.  Wheelchair?  He can and does learn to walk.  He even uses the motorized chair as a crutch in one scene, leaning against it as it moves forward using it to steady his balance.  Hello?  Has anyone in this film ever used a wheelchair or had problems walking?  The last thing you would use to steady your balance is a moving chair!  We see him standing wobbly for the first time and within days, he is able go climb in and out of windows and even run a relay race. Pleassssssssssse.  Caroline takes him to the beach in an attempt to fix him up with the perfect match.  A heavy set loner who contemplates dark thoughts.  She takes them to the beach and and the two girls get the motorized wheelchair out of the trunk and somehow manage to get it and Pumpkin to the shore.  A motorized wheelchair, none of which I have encountered are liftable by a human being or two, in the trunk?  A wheelchair of any kind on a sandy beach?  Did anyone do their homework here? The date is a disaster.  Caroline's friend is insulted and runs off. Caroline and her boyfriend, chipped beef, run after her and the three of them leave to take the angry friend home.  Pumpkin is left alone on the beach all day and retrieved later that night.  Let's not overemphasize how shallow  and callous these characters can be. The film follows the obvious plot of me and you against the world.  After hesitating and a little backtracking, Caroline realizes that love will indeed conquer all.  After much haggling, she dumps chipped beef, who in the movies most ludicrous sequence, takes off in tears and the film degenerates into high camp, painful hilarity.  The sorority girls are exposed as shallow, vain, surface creatures.  Big shock.  Everyone gets redeemed, the end. The one plus to this utter disaster is the sound track.  With a Bjork song in the mix and several other interesting tunes it is the films saving grace.Christina, I still love you.  Not all risks are successful ventures.  Keep trying!

The filmmakers obviously didn't talk to any of those people.The movie could be about a couple of former high school nerds who can't understand why blonde chicks aren't constantly attached to their genitals, so they decided to make a movie with their buddies about how bitchy they all must be.Well, they missed the truth by a longshot. Ricci's lover is not handicapped--he acts like a fully cognizant loner, except with a limp. Ricci's character is surrounded by a catty Mother, snotty sorority sisters and the stuck-up jock boyfriend, all of whom are tired cliches that explain their behavior by spewing the filmmakers' naive assumptions (Mom tells Ricci to just forget about all her troubles because Yes, life is easy; Ricci claims she's Never experienced pain before her sex scandal with the handicapped boy).Ricci's emotional arc is smokescreen. The poor actress does her best to fill the spaces between her simplistic dialogue with tears, which only drowns us with melodrama.There's no plot. Most movies focus on one action for the heroine to complete. PUMPKIN keeps making crap up as it goes along. Is the film about winning the Challenged games? Ricci's sorority contest? Ricci's membership in the organization? When is it over? The action drags on and on, moving only if some cartoon unnaturally blames Ricci for something she obviously didn't do.PUMPKIN's filmmakers might claim this is all camp. They might say, We made everything this far-fetched on purpose, and we think it's hilarious.They would be incorrect. Their jabs don't poke at the truth. Every behavior is shrill and phony. Somebody like John Waters would go over-the-top and stay there with chaos and charisma. At least he'd sustain the flick with stunts. He would never bog the script down in fake lovesickness.I'm fed up with movies like this. You've seen it all in HEATHERS, JAWBREAKER, DROP DEAD GORGEOUS, BRING IT ON and more.

Christina Ricci is Carolyn McDuffy, most popular sorority sister who dates the most popular student and star tennis player Kent (Samuel Ball). Even though Carolyn is fairly well adjusted, her sisters are as shallow as they come. They volunteer to coach some special athletes as a means to win best sorority. Hank Harris plays Pumpkin Romanoff, one of their special athletes, who gets assigned to Carolyn. Pumpkin immediately falls for Carolyn, but she tries to do her best to be a friend, and besides, she already has a boyfriend, the almost perfect Kent.An offbeat comedy, Ricci is especially good. In fact I could almost see Reese Witherspoon in that role. Or, Ricci could have played any of the Witherspoon comedy roles. SPOILERS. At some point Carolyn realizes that she is falling for the gentle Pumpkin, and Kent is jealous. Plus all the sorority sisters shun her because Pumpkin doesn't belong with their kind. Kent is distraught, drives his car off a cliff accidentally and it plunges down and explodes, an accident no one can survive, but Kent is only injured. At the end he is coaching the special kids from his wheelchair, Pumpkin is running the last leg of a relay, losing badly, when he sees Carloyn show up, energized he runs fast and wins for his team.

This pumpkin is rotten and it stinks.The first step to repairing the movie is to fire Christina Ricci and hire someone who can act. Ricci's performance is absolutely dreadful, Why did she not receive a golden raspberry award. The next step to repairing this film would be to give it some direction. The central premise concerns Ricci's character falling in love with a disabled boy who she is tutoring, and their relationship starts to screw up her life and her local reputation. Why couldn't this movie have been a strait forward romantic/comedy? Simplicity is often the best approach right. Instead the movie tries to integrate three or four subplots which lead absolutely nowhere, and in an attempt to bring all the connections together, Pumpkin takes forever to end.I laughed once, maybe twice and that was it. If this is supposed to be a comedy, where is the humour? There is nothing remotely funny about this movie, nor is there anything charming, romantic, or original about it.

She has an attractive tennis player boyfriend named Kent, but ends up falling in love with Pumpkin.  That's when her life begins spiraling out of control.  The movie was dark, all right, but I didn't get what was comical about it.  Was it when Carolyn got thrown out of the sorority because she slept with Pumpkin?  Was it the explosive argument Carolyn had an explosive argument with Kent because he lost the tennis match, followed by an ugly breakup so Carolyn could be with Pumpkin?  Was it when Kent got badly injured in a car accident after leaving the formal when he fought Pumpkin and was defeated?  (Quite embarrassing, and also a bit unrealistic.)  Fact is, there was nothing comical about this movie.  I know that the message of the movie was that mentally challenged people have feelings and can fall in love like everyone else, but this?

Growing up with a Psychologist mother contributed to the fact that I don't think any situation in any movie involving developmentally challenged people can be funny in any way.The movie became so ludicrous that it almost became offensive. Character development was nonexistent, and like the oh-so-many other moments and parts of the movie that were meant to be funny, it wasn't. For instance, someone trying to overdose isn't funny. The only funny moment in the movie is when Kent drives off the cliff, explodes in a giant fireball and landing causes a mushroom cloud and in the next scene he has no abrasions, bruises, lacerations, or burns. Perhaps the worst part that is meant to be funny, is when the West Side Story music for the rumble is playing as Pumpkin gets beaten up by Kent. Ha-ha-ha.The only worthwhile actor to watch was Hank Harris, as Pumpkin. If you have not seen this movie -- I advise you never to see it.

All of Carolyn's sorority sisters are in shock also and they put her on suspension.

This film is a dark and satirical and it makes fun of just about everything. The humor is very dry and sarcastic in tone and their really isn't any laugh out loud scenes although I did chuckle at Ricci's poem Ode to Pasadena. And the stabs at Long Beach College are very funny but I found the script as a one note joke. It makes fun at all the preppy sorority's and when everyone is shocked by the relationship between Ricci and Harris it's in the name of sarcasm but the joke wears out fast and the film started to wear thin before the first hour was over. It was never stated clearly why Carolyn fell in love with Pumpkin, maybe that was part of the joke. And when you think the film is over, it's not. It goes on about 15 minutes too long and gives you more of the same. The humor is agonizingly blatant. We get the joke early but the film never shifts gears and it continues on with more of the same.

I figured I'd visit this movie on IMDb and would find nothing but bad reviews. Instead I find a bunch of people preaching about how great it was. I will give you one thing however. The story is fantastic, I think had somebody actually taken their time with this movie it could have been much better. Instead you slap together a bunch of actors nobody likes or has ever heard of and attempt to make a decent movie... GOOD LUCK! and the car over the cliff? Come On! like the page says they were too poor to do their own scene so they used another movie's. Don't get me started about the characters! they're so unbelievable like how Kent Says The F word... he hesitates every time he says it, they did not suck me into the story at all, I was quite aware that i was watching a movie. I think the worst part about this movie is the more times you see it, the worse it gets. I watched it once when it came out, didn't like it. again when I had grown up a little thought maybe I'd give it a second chance. Finally I watched it again last night because a friend of mine really wanted to see it. so I guess in conclusion, if you're a 15 year old girl, or a 60 year old grandparent You MAY appreciate this movie, Otherwise you should be disgusted.
