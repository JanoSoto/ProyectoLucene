[{"Title":"Misunderstood","Date":"22 April 2004","Score":"63 out of 67 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" MINOR SPOILERSMisunderstood classic remains one of Henson's finest and most personal films. It may seem funny to call a movie as beloved as this one 'misunderstood,' but people do seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhl's snappy screenplay and Paul Williams's knockout songs. Now while these things are admittedly great, as is the movie's formal playfulness (screenplay-within-the-screenplay, film break, etc.), what distinguishes 'The Muppet Movie' from the other Muppet films is the serious, wistful thread that runs through the picture. It's a road movie, all right, but like most road movies, the pleasure is in the getting there, and the achievement of the characters' goals is tempered by uncertainty, and by the knowledge that they can never really go back again. Throughout the film, we are shown the down side of show business, even before the Muppets have 'made it' Piggy abandons Kermit without a second thought at a phone call from her agent, Gonzo expresses the loneliness and regret of a performer's life on the road in his haunting 'I'm Going to Go Back There Someday,' and, worst of all, Kermit is continually tortured and tested by Doc Hopper, who wants him to commercialize his art for the unholiest of purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson would have made of his family's management of the company after his death.) Kermit himself agonizes over his choices in the desert conversation scene, and the final 'Magic Store' number questions whether it's all been worth it, before concluding that it probably doesn't matter either way. All this is punctuated with the expected Muppet chaos and satire and deliciously awful jokes, and of course the serious stuff wouldn't work if it weren't. But 'The Muppet Movie' isn't just another jokefest, as the rest of the diminishing-return Muppet films would become. No, it's a lovely, gentle metaphor about the relationship between art and entertainment and business, and it's every bit as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.

The Incredible Journey and Horatio Alger tale come together for a positive spin on the usually depressing subject of existentialism. In essence, the travails of the muppets boil down to the finale song of the movie Life's like a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending. They create their own reality, which has all the trappings of every epic tale a lofty goal at the end of what is necessarily a obstacle-laden journey; an ever-increasing group of like-minded individuals for camaraderie; a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption; and a big-budget Hollywood ending because, darn it all, they CAN.Only Jim Henson could pull this off. He walks the line between sentimentality and philosophy without swerving too long or too hard into either. Of course it seems odd that invest such weight into a film starring puppets, but in the end perhaps they are the perfect, uh, puppet to make these points. The movie's atmosphere allows for the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream, the happy ending, unnecessary cameos, and bursting into song at the drop of a hat. Usually these aspects are anathema to quality in film, but the self-deprecating manner under which the story is delivered makes for guilt-free viewing. One of the few films that can truly be called suitable for all ages.The other muppet-related films (including The Empire Strikes Back), while palatable, do not touch the simple grace of this film. Take, for instance, the musical number Hope that Something Better Comes Along, the duet of Kermit and Rowlf. Amusing in its vaudevillian goofiness, yet makes a bitingly crucial point about the motivations behind life choices. Brilliant.

But his magic alone wasn't sufficient to do more than clever skits, both before and after this gem. Some fated match of director, writers, songwriters and puppeteers came together to create an underappreciated masterpiece.Forget the kids -- this is a great work, period. Among the best story-films ever. And nowhere is the enfolding of reality and fantasy more rich than here. Naturally, you have the mix of humans (accented by celebrity cameos) and puppets. And some puppets are of humans, some of human-like animals, and some of animal-like animals. But that's just the tokens.The real novelty comes in the story. It is a film about the making of itself, with a wonderful sequence at the end where the film is represented in cartoonish props contrasted with a `real' rainbow. Throughout, one weaves between being in the story and observing the story. Kermit (Henson's alterego) says `I hope you appreciate I'm doing my own stunts.' Think about it.The songs, themselves self-referential, are important frosting `why are there so many songs about rainbows?'`Life is a movie, write your own ending, keep believing, keep pretending...' You don't get that in common fare. If you have kids, this is the most educational exposure you can give them among the kiddie offerings. There's nothing more powerful than the ability to perform abstract reasoning and the foundation of that is the play between what things are and what things represent them.

I'm a great fan of puns, and this movie has them quite well placed, but one of the amazing aspects of it is its pacing it's not really high-speed children's pacing where the filmmakers just randomly decide to move the story along without giving the character's depth, it's just kind of moves along with the characters wherever they want to go.Kermit the Frog is just an awesome character. His voice and the expressions on his puppet-face are fantastic. But above all, he points out why he's popular--he can sing and make jokes too!--but more appropriately why he's so endearing--he, without any effort, inspires everyone to search for their dreams. In the meantime, he also has to deal with himself, which is an uncommon theme in family movies.It also contains quite an ensemble of comedians making appearances here and there, some to great effect, others to a little less (I think Mel Brook's part was just a bit overplayed, do you?).

The writing and story was just great the film is very funny and it gives a good message in the end plus it's supported by appearances from many top notch stars. This film shows how the Muppets began their rise to fame as they showed it in their own way by doing their own movie! Remember the song dreams begin with a rainbow! Kermit has a fateful meeting with a big time talent agent and it's then that his hopes of becoming a star has him on a journey to Hollywood! Along the way on his journey for show business he meets his usual cast and gang of characters Fozzie the Bear(the bad comedian)the Great Gonzo(chicken)and the prim and proper Miss Piggy as all too have big dreams on the way out to California. Now enter the drama and road encounters with Doc Hooper(Charles Durning)who as a fast food mogul wants Kermit to promote his French fried frog leg franchise, yet probably Kermit is gonna be a cooked frog! Along the way the journey is funny and entertaining with fun and crazy mishaps and it's guided along with the witty lines and musical songs including the hit The Rainbow Connection. Plus it's supported just fine by appearances from legendary stars like Mel Brooks, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, Dom Deluise, and Orson Welles. And in the end it proves a special and important message that as you see the Muppets learn that real life can actually be in the form of a movie. And really with your thoughts and dreams you can make your own movie. Overall a good classic that both adults and children will laugh with and enjoy.

Along the way he runs into lots of people such as Fozzie Bear, Gonzo the great, and Miss Piggy. Also, an evil man is trying to capture Kermit.All of the Muppet films are highly enjoyable.

It was released seven years before I was born, so I obviously didn't get to see it at the time (nor did I get to see its two successors when they were first released). However, I saw a lot of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990. I finally got around to seeing this movie for the first time around the mid-nineties, after hearing the soundtrack. Unsurprisingly, I liked it at the time, and revisiting it in recent years hasn't exactly been disappointing.One day, while Kermit the Frog sits in a swamp with his banjo after singing Rainbow Connection, a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes by in a boat and urges him to pursue a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and goes west. He soon meets Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convinces him to come along. The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, the owner of a frog leg restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot. As a frog, Kermit is disgusted by this, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. On their road trip across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who soon becomes Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do anything to force Kermit to become his restaurant chain's mascot, so Kermit finds himself in increasing danger! One thing many people praise this film for is the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated Rainbow Connection at the beginning, and more good tunes follow, such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, Movin' Right Along, and I'm Going to Go Back There Someday, a poignant ballad sung by Gonzo. Never Before, Never Again, the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I would consider rather weak, and their romance seems awfully sudden. The Muppets in this movie are generally lovable, just like they are on TV, and some of them provide a lot of the humour, including Fozzie, making his first appearance in the film hopelessly trying to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand-up, and, well, if you're familiar with these famous Muppets, you should know what to expect from each of them. Some of the live actors who appear briefly in the film can also be funny, such as Dom DeLuise as Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the Insolent Waiter. Also, it's not 100% comedy. There are serious parts of the film which they also did well.Watching this original Muppet movie again this year was my first time watching any of them since seeing Muppets from Space (one of the Muppet movies made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw that film, which had never happened before when I watched any film or TV show featuring the popular puppet characters! Not only is that movie not very funny, I also think it's a tad too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I stated in my review of it! However, I can't say I think the same of any of that movie's predecessors, including this one, released twenty years earlier. The Muppet Movie seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and since it has so much to like, not just for kids, that's understandable. I highly doubt there's much left to say about The Muppet Movie that hasn't been said at some point in the past thirty years, but today, it remains good family entertainment.

Impossible it is to watch them without getting some kind of warm, fuzzy feeling inside. So, I guess what's important is that this movie seemed to very successfully capture what makes the muppets so special. I don't remember much about the details of the plot but the various moments and characters in the film I recall quite fondly. In fact, there was quite a nostalgic atmosphere to the whole movie but without being self-conscious in any bad way. Refreshing for someone who possibly gets too hung up on meticulous details and technique; the magic transcends all that other stuff. 'Tis indeed what movies are made of.So, how does the film achieve these things? Hmmm, nice question! Stumped am I? Let's see. Really, I feel like it's quite simple. The filmmakers believe in their material and don't take themselves too seriously in the process. I probably wouldn't say the film has many truly inspired moments, but it does have a certain life to it (that funnily enough a great many real people movies lack). A zest. You really want to believe in these funny little people and their adventures. They also have a certain innocence about them that makes them all the more endearing.Generally I get the impression that the people that made the movie just weren't afraid to try whatever felt right to them at the time which gives the whole thing quite a loose feel. Kind of like a really accessible and enjoyable extended jazz session. Lots of talent, little predictability and plenty of warm personalities coming through. The cameos were of course a bunch of nice surprises for instance. Maybe I don't feel I have much to say about it because I was half-asleep when I saw it (and/or as I write this review). Anyway, I'm sort of semi-repeating myself here but I really liked the sense of family the movie had. Full of love I suppose you might say. Again, a feeling of nostalgia comes to mind which not many films manage to achieve so effectively or effortlessly.And to repeat myself once more, one of the film's best charms is its very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Like the Nathaniel Hawthorne quote about happiness being (like) a butterfly, so The Muppet Movie greatly succeeds partially by not seeming to try to do so. Same with beauty being best undiscovered or untouched or unforced or something like that. Anyway, if that sounds sappy, I also reckon it was pretty hilarious.So, all in all, this movie was very funny, touching and difficult not to smile along to. Plus it features lots of great music! Highly recommended to all humans, both the young and the young at heart.

You can only imagine all the Muppet Performers, on their hands and knees, in a trench, dragging along the floor of the set with rich and famous Orson Welles. Most of the cameos work quite well and it is especially nice to see Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy for one last time. The Paul Williams score is almost perfect and he remains a very under-rated composer. He is a genius, and still plays Vegas in concert, from time-to-time. Miss Piggy seems larger-than-usual in this film. Note her extended proboscis (snout)! I love this film which is an unabashed send-up of Babes-In Arms (Let's put on a show.) similar to Muppets From Manhattan. Although Charles Durning is great as Doc Hopper in a parody of Colonel Sanders, it also seems a bit off for a kid's movie. But then, Jim Henson always did the unique and unusual, didn't he? The DVD transfer by Disney has some issues uneven and thin sound quality at times. It will probably play better on 5.1 sound system. A few images are grainy or off-focus.

He also finds that romantic sparks fly when he meets a diva pig with delusions of grandeur.That's the core part of the initial Muppet group identified, the slightly awry element arrives in the form of a fat, sweaty guy in a white suit named Doc Hopper, who just happens to sell frog's legs as cuisine. He takes a shine to Kermit's pins and decides that he simply must have them to promote his wares, whether Kermit agrees or not.The remainder of the film is essentially an extended chase sequence as Kermit and the gang hightail it towards Hollywood with Doc Hopper and his toadying (no pun intended) assistant close behind.And this to me is the problem with the initial Muppet Movie, the best parts are the simple times, Kermit sitting on the log singing Rainbow Connection without a care in the world, the awkward but undeniable chemistry between pig and frog, the stoner-ish hep dialogue between the members of the Electric Mayhem, the stand-up bear who is terrible at stand up.They kinda lost me when the film veered into 'eating the primary character's legs' territory. They definitely lost my four year old in the looming torture scene, and nearly killed the poor boy when the Frog assassin clad all in black and looking decidedly evil showed up. (I really didn't remember these things from my previous viewings.) Despite these depressing and out of place sequences there is still a lot to love about the first Muppet Movie, the constant breaking of the fourth wall is already obvious, the general funkiness of the Electric Mayhem and the timelessness of Kermit's tunes, the cheesy jokes that are so bad that you can't help but smile &#x96; especially when delivered with such innocence and charm by a handpuppet&#x85; the inclusion of several big name cameos, none of whom for a moment let on that they are conversing with a sock, yet some of whom still manage to out-ham the very same talking puppets.The Muppet Movie finds a bunch of frogs, pigs, bears and whatevers coming to terms with their own existence, growing into their own skin and fur. Over the years some peripheral characters became more central, and others stepped back to spout occasional quips when required.Most of all this film showed that there was entertainment value to be found in these talking socks, and that people of all ages could enjoy their shenanigans guilt free.Final Rating &#x96; 7 / 10.

This is one of the first movies that I remember seeing and totally loving. I saw it at the drive-ins here in California in the late 70s. I was already a big fan of The Muppet Show on TV so I was primed for the movie, and the movie did not disappoint. Basically it takes the whole absurdist ethos of the Muppet show and transports it from vaudeville into a road movie. Kermit the Frog is on a quest to become famous; not because he wants to take champagne baths and ride in a private jet, but because he wants to make millions of people happy. Of course.Along the way he picks up all his beloved muppet friends, most endearingly Fonzie Bear who he meets at a seedy bar doing stand-up. They sing Movin' Right Along, a song that has always charmed me with its upbeat melody and its theme of friendship and shared discovery. He also encounters enough Hollywood movie stars to fill a Stanley Kramer movie, including comedy luminaries like Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, and Mel Brooks. Brooks in particular has a rather dull bit, and you are left feeling that Henson could have cut a few of these cameos out if he wasn't afraid of offending the stars. Anyway, as befits a road trip movie like this the very first person he meets is Dom DeLuise.The ending is one of the more odd examples of literally breaking down the 4th wall that you will find in any children's movie. The Hollywood dream seems to be crumbling all about them, when a real rainbow pierces the Hollywood set with its authentic joy and mystery. I'm sure this was meant to relate to some of Jim Henson's own personal or spiritual experiences.This is the best movie with Muppets by a long shot. If you or anyone else was wondering why the Muppets were so popular back in the 70s, considering how poor the movies have been for the last few decades, I think this film has at least aged well enough to provide a clue.

For unlike most so-called creative types attempting to sell to, or worse yet cynically exploit, children nowadays, Jim never seemed to really forget what it was like to be a child. And if there ever was a moment in which he demonstrated this, Labyrinth aside, it is 1979's Muppet Movie. Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson came to work in children's television as a puppeteer and ended up with a half-hour show of his own on primetime television, The Muppet Movie ends up an affirmation of everything more progressive, understanding sorts would say to children who did not quite meet the expected norm during the 1980s. And as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are gagged and bound from speaking about anything lest someone might get offended, the open celebration of difference or diversity that formed a large part of The Muppet Show is on offer here. I have said it in other comments, but I must say it here. A great light in the world went out the day Jim Henson died.The Muppet Movie begins with its cast sitting down to see the premiere of what were about to see for the next eighty or so minutes. In short, precise strokes, we are introduced to the major players as well as some of the minors. And when the story proper begins, boy are we given a great song to bring us into the moment. The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of what the Muppets, especially Kermit, were. These were not just a bunch of felt puppets with singular personalities who combined to put on a show. They were living things based upon a part of all of us, only writ so much more boldly than we are used to. As each Muppet was introduced to us in turn, we saw another reflection of part of ourselves, and of course the children in the audience would respond differently to each character. Hence, everyone had a favourite. When Animal appeared behind a drum kit and attempted to eat a cymbal, I knew I had found one of mine. Nowadays, I am more of a Swedish Chef fan, but what the hey.Complementing the characters was a string of musical numbers that further developed their motivations and personalities. Can You Picture That? shared an insight into Dr. Teeth and his band as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most relevant song to me was Gonzo's number, asking what he is and where he came from. Many of us would spend a lifetime gazing into the stars and, like Gonzo, saying we knew we would be going back there someday. Not that all the songs were so deadly serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decide to combine their talent (or lack thereof) and hit the road. If any evidence were required that present-day musicians have lost the ability to use the pop structure to create something listenable, this number would be it. Never before, and never again, would the group dynamic of a cast and the music so perfectly complement one another. With the puppeteers and voice actors so perfectly on top of their game, the human cast had a lot to live up to.Which makes it all the more amazing that the human element also lived up to their end of the deal. Cameos literally pepper the film, with everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas popping in to offer their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man one would expect to see in a film about the Muppets, appears to set up a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks' cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when I was a small boy, but I suspect that is because Henson knew why I would find it disturbing now. The big acting strength, though, comes from Charles Durning, who as Doc Hopper embodies everything both Henson and his audience determined to resist. At every junction, Hopper comes to either offer Kermit the chance to sell out and betray his own kind. Or perhaps offer stops being the right word when Hopper's attempts to ensure Kermit's compliance become progressively more forceful and violent. The whole thing is one big metaphor for how every artist has his heart broken by the world.Of course, Animal also shows up to remind us that just because our friends are not sweet and cuddly does not make them any less of a friend. In point of fact, Animal turns out to be the best friend that Kermit has in that moment. And that has been the core message of every good show or film Henson has been involved in ever since. That shunning or dismissing others simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences could literally be the worst mistake one ever makes. There can be little doubt that in today's world where a moron in a purple suit can tell my sons they are not good if they do not have good feelings for fifteen seasons and still not come under serious investigation by child welfare authorities, Henson's creature workshop could never have got off the ground. To misquote the album title, daring to be stupid is one thing, but enforcing the choice upon others is another matter. The Muppet Movie demonstrates how Henson dared to ask us all to think, both inside and outside of the proverbial box. There will never be another entirely like him, but he never would want us to stop trying.Therefore, The Muppet Movie is the epitome of a ten out of ten film. If we were to send a film out into the cosmos to prove to intelligent life that we are worth more than being obliterated, this would be it. "},{"Title":"Muppets at their peak!

There just couldn't be a better plot.(spoilers ahead) It starts off with Kermit playing a beautiful number on his banjo, and once a Hollywood agent remarks that he's got enough talent for the silver screen, Kermit hops on his bike (a classic scene) and heads West. Shortly thereafter he becomes horrified at the sight of a fast food place that serves frog legs! After Kermit pairs up with Fozzie, Doc Hopper, owner of the fast food chain, offers Kermit a job as a spokesfrog for the restaurants. Naturally, Kermie declines, and a frantic chase for the frog happens throughout most of the movie. Along the way Kermit and Fozzie meet many other familiar faces, and they've got to act fast if they want to make it to the audition!As usual with the Muppets, everything is spectacular. From the sharp humor to the elaborate sets and puppetry, everything shines like a star. If you love the Muppets or are a beginning fan, check out 'The Muppet Movie'! You'll be glad you did.

Add unforgettable music, numerous celebrity cameos, some of the oldest puns in the book, and a cameo by Big Bird - and you have one great piece of cinema, now one of the most treasured videos I own.If your a fan of Jim Henson's Muppets, this is a must-see if you haven't already.

And that is what this movie is about. It's not just a bunch of puppets-- it's a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone.And while the humor and mirth of the film always feel good, they're not a fair judge of the movie. Only The Rainbow Connection and the powerful emotions it will realize. And it all fits in Rainbow Connection *is* the Muppet Movie, and vice versa.

The Muppet Movie was one of the first movies I remember seeing as a child, and it certainly enhanced my childhood and gave me a lot to think and dream about for a little kid, but the good news is that even now, it has lost nothing for me.The Muppets have always had a tremendous and subtle sophistication about them-- it's the type of thing that Disney always shoots for and rarely perfectly gets- that cast of characters who for children are endearing and accessible, but for adults have a whole different dimension of wit and personality that is hard to come by for even human actors half the time. And yet every muppet in this movie posesses that- even Animal! In fact, the movie- where the Muppets seem to be doing battle with every bumbling human to come along and attempt to take advantage of them (usually Doc Hopper but occasionally the excellent cameo cast)- is a metaphor for what I'm talking about. At the end of the day, the only characters we really believe in are the Muppets, not the humans- the humans come across flatter, less imaginative, far less inspiring. Kermit's combination of an existential dilemma and drive to succeed within himself are still chock full of beauty and honor, even to someone long since past grammar school. It's easier to care deeply about these Muppets in this film than hundreds of real human protagonists I've seen on the big screen.And as for emotional power- there are some movies that will cheer you up when you're down, and then there are films that will under no circumstances let you be down no matter how hard you try. This movie is definitely in the second category. It seems to achieve this firstly by the excellent script and aptly placed, well-written songs (when was the last time you could say that about a children's movie?), and secondly, oddly enough, by the directorial feel of the movie. Its pacing, its rambling-down-the-road quality, and its cinematic embellishments (the coziness of the restaurant that Kermit and Piggy go to, the eerie comfort of the desert fire, the smoky comedy club) all create this sort of intangible warmth that just radiates right off the screen. I wish someone today could recapture that again.So yeah, make sure your kids see The Muppet Movie. But don't commit the sin of growing out of it yourself. We miss you, Jim...

What's not to love about it? It's funny, it's musical, it's entertaining, it's emotional, it's everything that embodies the Muppets!In this movie we see how the Muppets got their start to stardom and fame; it's sort of a very loose parody of Jim Henson's start to fame, if I understand it right. Kermit the Frog enjoys his life in the swamp, but begins riding his bike to Hollywood after an agent tells him he should go and make millions of people happy. From there, he runs into a number of characters who have the same dream of making it big in Hollywood Fozzie Bear, The Electric Mayhem, Scooter, The Great Gonzo, Camilla the Chicken, Miss Piggy, Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Honeydew and Beaker, and others. Since this is the first Muppet movie, it began the tradition of including celebrity cameo appearances. We see Bob Hope, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Madeline Kahn, Carol Kane, Orson Wells, Jim Henson's wife, Jane, Edgar Bergen - the man who inspired Jim Henson to go into puppetry - and many other celebrities. My favorite cameo, though, is Big Bird! Yes, Big Bird is in this movie! I'm on my way to New York City to try to break into public television. I love that line!So, why does this movie work so well? I think it goes back to the fact that the Muppets are giving us their own style of entertainment, rather than them trying to conform to something else. There are a lot of scenes in this movie that take place that, to be fair, don't really need to happen. They don't really move the story forward, but Jim Henson and his writers and producers knew just how to make this stuff work. Take the scene where Gonzo flies in the sky with the balloons. It's a nice scene, but does it get the gang to Hollywood any quicker? Not really. How about when they all get to Hollywood just to have the lady at the front desk tell them they can't come in? It lasts less than 2 minutes, and they get in anyway. Was it really worth it to have that moment there? Probably not. And with that, the ending is something straight out of a fairy tale. The Muppets go to Lew Lord and tell him they want to be rich and famous, and Lew Lord just grants their request just like that? There's nothing realistic about that! Had any of these scenes been done in any other movie by any other group of people or any other production studio, I would really hate them! But this talented group of people knew what to do to make it entertaining, delightful, and great. That's the magic of Jim Henson and his Muppets he gives us something that normally wouldn't work, and makes it work so well that we'd come to love it! That takes a lot of great talent and creativity! The songs are other elements that don't add much to the simple plot of the movie, but, again, they're done so well here that we come to love and remember all of them! Moving Right Along, Can You Picture That, Never Before, I Hope That Something Better Comes Along, I'm Going to Go Back There Someday, The Magic Store/Finale, but, of course, everybody loves and remembers the Oscar-nominated classic, The Rainbow Connection. They're beautiful, they're fun, and they're so very touching. They stay with us, in our souls! That is powerful! Everyone always talks about how funny the Muppets are, and that shows in this movie! But very rarely do you hear about the heartfelt moments as well. The Muppets remind you through the emotions they experience that they feel just like we feel. Kermit's overall objective in this movie is probably the best example of this. He doesn't want to go to Hollywood simply to become rich and famous, it's not as superficial as that. He wants to go to Hollywood because it's his dream. What Kermit wants more than anything is for his dream to come true. You really feel for him during the scene when he talks to his conscience. He actually begins doubting himself, saying he never promised he'd make it. I love his last line in that scene I guess I was wrong when I said I never promised anyone. I promised me. Kermit begins to believe in himself again, and is determined to make his dream come true. That's pretty deep! Again, it's not something as superficial as just making a lot of money. The magic of his dream comes from, as he shares with Doc Hopper, the fact that he shared his dreams with others and they shared the dream with him.With that, sidebar, was I the only one asking what's wrong with Doc Hopper? You're really going to spend time and energy tracking down one frog all over the country? Why not get another frog? Why not do something that doesn't harm frogs at all? This man is stupid.Once again we have great Muppet tricks that make us stop and ask how did they do that. If you look up the facts about this movie either on this website or on Wikipedia, you'll learn how the Muppets were able to drive. Everyone went crazy when they saw Kermit riding a bicycle for the first time! There's a lost episode of The Jim Henson Hour that explains it if you're still curious. It's called Secret of the Muppets, look it up on YouTube.Final thoughts The Muppet Movie is a great, fantastic film! It has everything you want a Muppet movie to have. This movie has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid, and I still love it now! Check it out, you won't be disappointed, folks! BOOYIKA!

Because of this, I've always felt somewhat reluctant, and almost undeserving, to tackle the Muppet movies, feeling that my lack of childhood experiences of Kermit, Miss Piggy et al with hamper my enjoyment of them, or I will somehow not 'get it'. Well, after 27 Muppet-free years, Marc swayed me into finally taking the plunge, and, I'm happy to say, The Muppet Movie was an amazing experience, and one that made me feel like I'd known the vast array of characters for years.After a chance meeting with a Hollywood agent, Kermit the Frog leaves the comfort of his swamp in order to travel to Hollywood for an audition. Yet he is pursued by fast-food chain store owner Doc Hopper (Charles Durning), who sees Kermit as the perfect face to head his advertising campaign to promote his failing French-fries frog legs business. Kermit has other ideas, and after a punch up in the El Sleezo bar, he escapes with Fozzie Bear (a-wacca-wacca!) and his Studebaker. Further down the road he picks up more eager passengers, such as Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, the Great Gonzo, and Miss Piggy, who falls in love with Kermit after winning a beauty pageant.While the 'origin' movie is quite often the route that TV series take when taking the leap into movies, The Muppet Movie benefits from taking an almost classical take on the road movie. It is not about the destination, but the journey, and the journey is peppered from hilarious set-pieces, satirical swipes, and quite beautifully written (and performed) songs. The Muppets always appealed to all ages, and adults have the pleasure of enjoying many self-reflexive moments and audience awareness (Kermit turns to camera and says I hope you appreciate I'm doing all my stunts!), as well as cameos from the likes of James Coburn, Mel Brooks, Bob Hope, Steve Martin, Richard Pryor, Madeline Kahn, Elliot Gould, and Orson Welles.Amongst all the mayhem, there is also a quite beautiful moment in Gonzo crooning I'm Going to Go Back There Someday, recollecting his past in the sky and desire to return someday. Rainbow Connection is also a great song, but my favourite musical moment has to be Movin' Right Along, gleefully sang by Kermit (on his banjo) and Fozzie - the movie really came to life for me here. It's moments like these that really make this movie special, and something that can hopefully still be cherished by modern consumerism-obsessed children (if they can pull themselves away from their i-Phone). Marc warned me that if this film didn't leave me feeling warm inside then there is no hope for me. Well, thankfully it did, so maybe there's hope for me yet.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Having not seen this in years, The Muppet Movie retains its charm to my child-like heart","Date":"26 November 2011","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" With The Muppets out on screens right now, I decided to rewatch the first feature that starred the late Jim Henson's creations for the movies-The Muppet Movie.

There was also an amusing and touching one from Edgar Bergen with his dummy Charlie McCarthy. Amusing because of what was said and touching because they were the inspiration for Henson's career and that Bergen would soon pass away afterwards which was the reason for the dedication at the end-Dedicated to the memory and magic of Edgar Bergen. Besides the mostly hilarious screenplay by Jerry Juhl and Jack Burns, there were also wonderful songs by Paul Williams and Kenny Ascher of which the most inspirational was The Rainbow Connection as performed by Kermit the Frog at the beginning and which was later Oscar-nominated but lost to It Goes Like It Goes from Norma Rae. Oh, and Charles Durning was a hoot as the villain. Now I think I'll go rewatch The Great Muppet Caper...

Then, I moved on to Muppet Treasure Island and Muppets from Space but I wasn't till a few years ago that I finally saw this classic. Back in the mid to late 70's, Jim Henson decided to make his successful new program, The Muppet Show, into a feature film.

All of the main characters of the show, from Rowlf the Dog to Camilla the Chicken, and of course, Kermit the Frog, are all there along with a variety of songs. In addition, there are several cameos from stars of that time. Among my favorites are Steve Martin and, specifically, Mel Brooks.

(Fortunately there was only one.) I mean, I can understand how someone may not like 'Star Wars' due to the whole Sci-Fi genre, but to not like a movie starring some of the most lovable puppets in the history of mankind is almost sad. Okay, I will step off my soapbox now and review this movie.'The Muppet Movie' came out when I was seven. All of my friends wanted to see this as their birthday movie, so I think I saw it about four times in the first month in theaters.As a child many things attracted me to this and all the other Muppet movies & TV shows. The singing was probably the main one. Most of the songs in 'The Muppet Movie' are classics. From Rainbow Connection to I'm Going to Go Back There Someday, they're entertaining and thought-provoking.As an adult I see 'The Muppet Movie' in almost a whole different light. Yes, the things that thrilled me about it as a kid are still there, but it's the little jokes and such that are just plain hilarious.I mean, when you think about it, Jim Henson is a sick man. Kermit is a frog and that is in love with a sweet pig that wears purple gloves and could karate chop you into two pieces. Fozzie is a stand-up comedian bear. Gonzo is a 'whatever' that is infatuated with chickens. Then you have two old guys that heckle, a piano-playing dog, a rock band with a maniac drummer, a Swedish chef that you can't understand and a number of other characters that are just plain eccentric.Yet, for these reasons and more, Henson has entertained millions of children and adults, giving us all something special to watch and remember him by. 'The Muppet Movie' will always remain in my heart for many reasons, but I think the biggest one is because it's a movie, unlike a lot of recent children's movies, that I feel comfortable to have my kids watch. Plus, I don't get bored out of my mind with jokes that are dumbed down to my kids' level.It's a great movie that is sure to be remembered forever.

Miss Piggy, already a T.V. diva, even went as far as to protest on the Oscars as to why she was not nominated to which host Johnny Carson told her the only Oscar she was worthy of was Oscar Mayer. Kermit, of course, was much more humble, and coming from the swamp as opposed to a luxurious sty, that makes perfect sense to me. In fact, if it wasn't for Dom De Luise paddling through that swamp on a boat and finding Kermit strumming a banjo singing The Rainbow Connection, he might still be there today! It is De Luise's suggestion that he get himself to Hollywood and present himself as their newest romantic star. After all, the last time frogs made an impression in Hollywood was those nasty ones who along with some snakes and other swamp creatures invaded Ray Milland's plantation in the horror epic Frogs. The musical adventure follows Kermit's journey, his romance with beauty contestant winner Miss Piggy, and most nefariously, Charles Durning's desire to use Kermit for commercials for his chain of frog's legs restaurants which of course makes Kermit hopping mad. All of the muppet regulars join Kermit and Piggy for their journey to Hollywood and dreams of movie stardom. Even Big Bird makes an appearance, turning down Kermit's offer to join them, trying to find his way to public television rather than that dangerous world known as Hollywood.There's a dozen cameos by various celebrities of the era (and a few of the past) including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy as judges in Miss Piggy's beauty contest, Bob Hope who makes jokes while selling Kermit ice cream, Richard Pryor as a sarcastic balloon salesman, Milton Berle as a shyster car salesman, Steve Martin as a sarcastic waiter who almost spoils Miss Piggy and Kermit's date, Cloris Leachman as an officious movie studio secretary (sneezing as she is surrounded by the furry creatures invading her office), and finally, Orson Welles as a very imperious seeming movie mogul who hides a huge heart of gold underneath his enormous girth.The Rainbow Connection, Kermit's theme song here, has almost surpassed It's not easy being green as his theme song. After many years of making the rounds on every variety show and of course Sessame Street, the muppets moved onto a very popular syndicated show which lead to their transition into the movies. This was one of the biggest hits of the 1979 summer season and has stood the test of time, even if some of the cameos by the various older stars may not ring any bells of familiarity with today's younger audiences. As for the other songs in the film, they are vibrant and peppy, if shortened for the movie with lyric changes that were heard on the original soundtrack album. Miss Piggy really hams it up with her big solo, Never Before, Never Again, but even that is really worth a Golden Apple. Seldom after has Hollywood given us entertainment that continues to appeal to practically everybody to this day.

And perhaps for that list's editors.Actually you'd never find this sense of vagabondage, self-suffering, dream's sheer value, or the collective desire to be, in a Muppet movie again. It is their only road movie yet, with all the uniqueness of the case. And, in the same time, it's one of the happiest biography-movies ever; look at the cameo of Henson's other famous character (Big Bird) who at one moment tells Kermit that he's going to New York to break into public television, which already happened through Henson's landmark TV show Sesame Street (1969)! It's like Henson says I Did It. This feel of pride touches you yet in a lovely humble way, as someone chronicles his achievements while making another new one.I loved exceptionally the movie-in-the-movie matter; Henson doesn't get board out of assuring that he and the rest of his creative buddies are basically viewers, simple viewers just like you. So the viewer also can make their own movie/ their dream. This meaning hasn't been ever clearer before.There is a delightful magic all over it. You feel all the time a romantic sensibility, with a taste of latent dolefulness too. Look at the intro of Kermit. From choosing the arborous location, to the tender camera's motion and the so smooth editing ; aside from being a holy cinematic moment, it personified coming back to nature, the beauty of the innate talent, and the loneliness of Kermit and his dream as well.And the songs! Ohh, I've never been fascinated with a musical like this unless very few. Never Before is a complete classic. I'm astonished how big performers such as Sinatra or else didn't cover it ?! Moving Right Along is the Muppets' own optimism's anthem. Or Find Your Rainbow Connection where the lyrics, the melody, and the singing deliver the meaning smartly and enjoyably. Actually I consider this, as a whole, one perfect soundtrack for a dream's journey.It reminds me with (The Band Wagon &#x96; 1953). Actually it doesn't need much of thinking to realize that (The Muppet Movie) bears a resemblance to this great classic; whereas both of them are musical comedies, based originally on one lonely artist who wants to be, and center around making a musical; it's the way some movie makers see their dream, and then recreate it in a movie, yet as beautiful as a dream.The ending was the weakest part. How the Hollywood producer just convinced this easily ??? The movie was sluggish there. Or maybe, just maybe, this is the movie's own definition for what a stroke of luck is ! As you see, this script teaches us, the hopeful dreamers, that it needs a lot  talent, faith, togetherness, solidarity, patience, a bit of failure.. depression.. being lonely, prosperity granted by God (aka  luck), and a portion of hypocrisy as well (Kermit commends Miss Piggy at the final number then apologizes to us clarifying how forced he is  Hollywood Talk !).It's a musical comedy about making a musical comedy, or the musical comedy for this group of unknown yet talented misfits. A lot of stars got to support it, but the real star of it was the pure essence or the extract of Henson's dream/life/movie  Life is a movie, write your own ending. WAW ! So you can be the hero of your life ?! Make your own destiny ?! Great men did it. Jim Henson is one. Yet, he's the one who told you that it isn't impossible. You can do it too.

Frog, which gives us a prologue of what the whole adventure is about, throughout the story, this is one fun movie.Essentially, it's a road trip movie, where Kermit travels cross-country with a dream of pursuing a rich and famous contract to entertain. Along the way, our green hero meets a series of other aspiring actors, comedians, singers, and musicians, who coincidentally, are muppets like Kermit himself. Is this how the Muppets really started? Approximately how it happened, Kermit tells us.Not since It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World has the cameo formula been used so prolifically and successfully. The aspiring stars encounter many recognizable faces during their Odyssey; some just blink across the screen, but others have very memorable cameos. Steve Martin's amusing bit as a rude waiter is probably the best. Puppeteer Jim Henson's nod to his inspiration, Edgar Bergen, is especially touching.Anyone who ever watched the Muppets TV show will get to see all of their favorite characters, they're all here. The puppetry work is magnificent; look especially for Kermit riding a bicycle (how dey do dat???) In-jokes and references to old movies are everywhere, but the best one-liners are reserved for Kermit himself. An example when the crooks are terrorizing Kermit and Piggy, she affectionately says to her short, green, and handsome beau, I wouldn't give up this evening together for anything, would you? Uhhh, make me an offer.... I also love the gunfight at the OK Corral scene brilliantly absurd silliness.Gotta get Movin' right along now, but to summarize a good natured movie that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or movie genre taste.

It tells the story of how they all met. The whole gang was there Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Bunsen, Beaker, Scooter, even Statler and Waldorf, the critics. The movie opens with Kermit in the swamp singing about rainbows. He's suddenly greeted by Bernie, a Hollywood agent lost in the swamp. He tells Kermit about Hollywood, where dreams come true. As much as he hated to leave the swamp, he wanted to fulfill his destiny, so Kermit hopped (pun intended) on his bicycle and headed for Hollywood. He didn't get very far, due to a steam roller ran over his bike.              He arrived at the El Sleazo Cafe where he witnessed the worst comedian in the business Fozzie Bear. Kermit saved his act by dancing with him on stage. The performance was witnessed by Doc Hopper and his assistant, Max. Hopper was opening a chain of frog leg restaurants. Yes, a restaurant that served frog legs for people to eat. Gross. He wanted Kermit to be his spokesperson, but Kermit declined. Fozzie wanted to accompany Kermit to Hollywood so they jumped in Fozzie's Studebaker that his uncle loanded to him while hibernating. The distance between Rhode Island and California was very long, but they could make it. Along the way they run into Big Bird. They ask if he would like a lift, but he declines. He's going to New York to be on public television. Maybe he could be on a children's show located on an inner-street where humans and monsters co-exist. 'Possibility, you know; They meet Dr. Teeth and his band, Floyd, Janice, Scooter, Zoot and Animal and a weird plumber, Gonzo. Gonzo and his chicken Camilla accompany Kermit and Fozzie who trade in Fozzie's classic Studebaker for an old Woody. They get it from used car salesman Milton Berle. They stop at a fair where Gonzo purchases a bunch of balloons from Balloon Vender Richard Pryor and Fozzie get's ice cream from Ice Cream Vendor Bob Hope. Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy entertain, and when first laying eyes on Kermit, Miss Piggy falls head over hooves. She joins them.         Doc Hopper continues to plague Kermit and pals. He hires a frog killer to go after him. They were even kidnapped while dining at a restaurant with Waiter Steve Martin. Mad Scientist Mel Brooks tried to electrocute Kermit, but Miss Piggy gives them whatfor; when experiencing car trouble, it's Dr. Teeth to the rescue! Kermit decides to stop running and stand up to Doc Hopper, so they stop at an old ghost town. Kermit meets Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant, Beaker, who show him their latest creation Insta-Grow Pills. Animal eats some and it really comes in handy when Doc Hopper tries to eliminate Kermit and pals. So, on to Hollywood! When they get there, Lew Lord is fascinated and prepares a standard Rich and Famous contract for Kermit the Frog and Company. And there you have it!        A pretty good movie.

I've seen many of their movies before, as well as their TV show, so I know that these characters are capable of being funny. Had I seen The Muppet Movie first, however, I likely would've avoided the muppets like the plague. A truly terrible film in just about every respect, The Muppet Movie is a disaster, and I find it strange that other people don't see that.In a nutshell, The Muppet Movie is about Kermit the Frog, who is convinced he may have a career in film, and goes on a crazy road trip to Hollywood, picking up new friends to come along. Things are further complicated, however, by a villainous man named Doc Hopper, who's intent on using Kermit to promote his fried-frog-leg business.This is not a complicated story. And yet, The Muppet Movie seems to have found the most convoluted way possible to tell it. The story is completely unfocused, and the whole production lacks any kind of cohesiveness. At times, I began wondering if this was really the entire film, as it seems that major scenes or necessary dialogue were missing somehow. Perhaps there was initially a longer cut of the film, but it was condensed in editing. Research may prove beneficial, but I'm not sure how much more time I want to waste on this film.The Muppet Movie also suffers from fairly poor comedy. I'll admit, the first 20 minutes has some pretty memorable scenes, and the many cameos (while a bit excessive) were fairly amusing. Yet, after the first 20 minutes, the whole film is a complete and utter drag. Paced absurdly slow, with almost no successful humor, The Muppet Movie is mind- numbingly boring.At the same time, many of the jokes are painfully terrible. Most of the time, it's hard to tell apart clever parody, or awful joke. I'm sure a lot of the humor was hilarious 30 years ago, but today, none of it really works.At least the songs are good, right? Well, no. Yes, Rainbow Connection is a classic, and Movin' Right Along is pretty catchy, but the rest of the songs are weak. Never Before, Never Again, is completely forgettable, and immensely dull. I Hope That Something Better Comes Along sounds like the lyrics were written by an eight year old, and I'm Going to Back There Someday just sounds like a bad rip-off of Rainbow Connection. Still, none of these songs are even close to as awful as Can You Picture That? I very nearly skipped this song because I despised it so, and in retrospect, that might not have been such a bad idea.The acting is all right, though hardly revolutionary. The human cast is basically just there to either move the story along, or interact with the muppets. Still, Charles Durning is pretty funny as Doc Hopper. And the many, many cameos are at least worth a smile. Still, Steve Martin's cameo may be one of the strangest I've seen. It wasn't so much funny as it was odd.The score, by Paul Williams, is fun. The uses of the Rainbow Connection theme are great, but there's not much here to note.The Muppet Movie is simply terrible. Slow, unfunny, poorly written, and with terrible songs, this is a disaster, and I can't believe how highly it's often regarded. Even the first 20 minutes, which I mentioned earlier as the funniest part of the film, never made me laugh. A handful of smiles and some clever cameos are all The Muppet Movie has to offer. In my opinion, it could only please the nostalgic, or the desperate.

Only 'Bambi' is his redeeming grace.  In reality, their work is too simple to be taken seriously and only due to other people's actions, namely Steve Jobs and Irvin Kerschner, that we remember their names better.  Magicians need more than charm to become true wizards.My favorite comic strip for the last 18 years has been Calvin & Hobbes because of Calvin's integrated reality.  There is the real world where Calvin exists, then there is the hallucinatory world where Hobbes exists with Calvin, and finally there is Calvin's imagination where he envisions himself on occasion.That is the most detail I've ever seen in an everyday comic strip.  This movie is almost on the same level.  Here is the grand exception.Like many kid films in the genre, the people (adults in particular) are cruel and cynical to better contrast the humanity and niceness of the Muppets.
