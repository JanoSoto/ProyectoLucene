Then I have to specify that I mean the Tyrone Power movie, not the Fairbanks one and certainly not the Banderas. Ah, elitism can be amusing sometimes...Seriously, though, this is one heck of a motion picture. The best part is the pacing; it's deliciously slow, in the most effective way. Characters are developed fully, tensions heighten gradually, and just when you're on the verge of getting bored - BOOM! A fantastic chase scene or swordfight perfectly repays your patience. Well, my patience, anyway. Maybe you were bored the whole way through? Tyrone Power is simply awesome in this flick. He's hilarious as the fey Don Diego, and he cuts an impressive figure as Zorro. It's easy to see that Batman was patterned on Zorro, as he also pretends to be a stupid playboy, but Bruce Wayne was *never* this cool.Basil Rathbone makes a great villain, as always, and his close-quarters duel with Zorro is, as I'm sure you've heard, one of cinema's great action scenes (I think the confined setting actually enhances the suspense). Even J. Edward Bromberg, who plays a slightly dated and silly character, somehow manages to come across well - it's interesting to see his character come into his own as the main villain at the end of the movie.Even the romance isn't a dud. Lots of amusing flirting goes on, and Linda Darnell certainly is easy on the eyes. Why can't they make action flicks like this anymore? To paraphrase a certain famous political catchphrase, it's the characters, stupid. Everybody in this movie is colorful and cool, and through them I get wrapped up in the plot. When the biggest complaint I have is a bit of rear-screen projection during a boat ride, you know the movie's almost perfect.

Both of Irish descent, the two actors exploded into superstar status in their twenties, due to a single starring role in films made within a year of each other (for Flynn, barely 26, it was in 1935's CAPTAIN BLOOD; Power's breakthrough, at 22, came in 1936's LLOYDS OF LONDON). Both actors were extraordinarily handsome, were great practical jokers both on and off-screen, fought continuously with their respective studios for better roles, married three times (Flynn fathered three daughters and a son; Power, two daughters and a son), lived wildly adventurous lives, becoming infamous for their sexual indiscretions, and would die, less than a year apart, within two years of making their only film together (1957's THE SUN ALSO RISES). However, while Flynn had a reputation as a charismatic hell raiser which would make him as many enemies as friends during his tempestuous life, Tyrone Power was, by all accounts, even more charming and likable in person than he was on screen, and was universally loved, even by his ex-wives.Both stars were considered premier swashbucklers of their time, and 1940's THE MARK OF ZORRO introduced Power to the genre dominated by Flynn. Just as Flynn's greatest triumph was a remake of an earlier Douglas Fairbanks classic (1922's ROBIN HOOD), Power's best-loved swashbuckler had first been a Fairbanks favorite, as well (1920's THE MARK OF ZORRO). As Don Diego de Vega, a cadet at 'the Academy' in Madrid who puts his gift with the sword to good use in an oppressed California, when recalled home by his father, he quickly adopts an effeminate persona (a la THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL), to mask his true ability and plans. While the charade infuriates his father (My son has become a PUPPY! he laments, at a time when the word 'homosexual' was not used), the guise helps the younger Vega worm his way into the confidence of the corrupt yet cowardly current Alcalde (the venerable J. Edward Bromberg) and his socially-conscious wife (Gale Sondergaard). Less 'taken in' is the true villain of the film, military commander Captain Esteban Pasquale (superbly portrayed by frequent Flynn nemesis Basil Rathbone), who sneers at the Alcalde's plan to marry Vega off to his niece, Lolita (the ravishing Linda Darnell), to quell local unrest; when Vega claims tardiness for the engagement dinner because of his bath water becoming 'tepid', Pasquale comments, Just as I fear poor Lolita's future married life shall be.The on-screen chemistry between Power and Darnell is terrific (a key scene, with Vega/Zorro disguised as a priest, as Lolita confesses her secret desires, would be 'spiced up' and recreated in the Banderas/Zeta-Jones 1998 update, THE MASK OF ZORRO). As the only other person who knows Zorro's real identity, Fray Felipe (Eugene Pallette, playing a role very similar to his 'Friar Tuck' in Flynn's ROBIN HOOD) has some of the film's wittiest dialog, and gets to show his swordsmanship in a brief duel with Pasquale (You should have been a soldier, the captain comments, after disarming him).If the film has a fault, it is that the Power/Rathbone climactic duel occurs too early. Staged by Errol Flynn's fencing master, Fred Cavens, the action is spectacular, confined to a single room, yet with Pasquale's death, the film loses it's most potent villain, and the final large-scale fight between the Alcalde's forces and the peons and gentry lacks the focus of the climax of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD.Directed with tongue-in-cheek by veteran film maker Rouben Mamoulian, and with an Oscar-nominated score by Fox's musical mainstay, Alfred Newman, THE MARK OF ZORRO was a major studio hit (plans for a sequel were begun, but dropped when it was discovered that Fox only had the rights to the title, THE MARK OF ZORRO; the name 'Zorro' belonged to another studio, ending any possibility of a follow-up).Tyrone Power had joined Errol Flynn as the reigning 'kings' of swashbucklers, a title both would find amusing, if limiting, but which would be how both actors are best remembered, today! "},{"Title":"Ever Watchable Classic Swashbuckler.","Date":"10 December 2013","Score":"23 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" The best swashbuckler ever made is how many regard 20th Century Fox's THE MARK OF ZORRO. Produced in 1940 for the studio by the uncredited Raymond Griffith and Darryl Zanuck the picture was Fox's answer to Warner Bros. who up to that time had, more or less, cornered the market with their finest array of swashbuckling adventures. With the perfect hero in Errol Flynn, who swept across our screens in such classics as Captain Blood, The Adventures Of Robin Hood and The Sea Hawk and all to the brilliant music of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, other studios found it difficult to equal Warner's expertise in creating such flagship adventures. But Fox's THE MARK OF ZORRO was one that did and in its star Tyrone Power they even had a comparable hero to Flynn. From a story The Curse Of Capistrano by Johnston McCully it was splendidly adapted for the screen by John Taintor Foote, crisply photographed in black and white by the great Arthur Miller and the whole thing was adroitly handled by Russian director Rouben Mamoulian.It is 1820 and a nobleman's son Don Diago Vega (Tyrone Power) returns home to California after spending some years at a military school in Spain. But he finds the province has greatly changed and has fallen under the dictatorship of an autocratic governor Don Luis Quintero (J.Edward Bromberg) and his ruthless sword wielding army Captain Estaban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). The people are heavily taxed and oppressed. Don Diago covertly takes up their cause and dons the guise of a masked avenger while maintaining a foppish and carefree persona to his family and friends. He raids the army coffers, returns to the peasants their meagre funds and avenges any harm that they incur. The picture ends with the people rising up against their oppressors, regaining their freedom from tyranny and Don Diago and Pasquale locked in an outstandingly staged sword fight to the death.Performances are superb from the entire cast. The swashbuckling Don Diago Vega is one of Ty Power's most likable and best remembered roles. It also revealed his fine flair for comedy. As the fop he could be quite amusing (on being informed that the villainous Captain Pasquale was once a fencing instructor in Madrid Don Diago looks through his monocle at Pasquale, sighs wearily and quips How exhausting). It's a shame he didn't do more movies like this. Two years later he was a pirate on the high seas in the enjoyable The Black Swan and in 1947 he appeared in Fox's colourful epic on the Conquistadores Captain From Castile but that was all. Historical roles in Prince of Foxes, The Black Rose and Son Of Fury were also enjoyable but none of these films ever gained any swashbuckling status. Excellent too was Basil Rathbone. His villain almost as sly and as cunning as his Guy of Gisbourne in Robin Hood two years earlier. And supplying the love interest was the lovely Linda Darnell who the following year would again star with Power in the Fox classic Blood And Sand again directed by Mamoulian. Also of interest is the casting of Eugene Palette as the church friar almost exactly the same role he played in The Adventures of Robin Hood.Of some note also is the brilliant score put together and conducted by Alfred Newman. The exciting main Zorro theme was written, not by Newman, but by the uncredited Hugo Friedhofer. It is an exhilarating heroic motif that the great Korngold himself would be proud to have written for Flynn. Great music is but one element that makes THE MARK OF ZORRO an unforgettable movie. Its popularity has endured since it was made almost 75 years ago and no doubt it will continue thrilling audiences for a long time to come.

This film has not aged a day in 63 years.....it is still a great tale of old California and the masked caballero, Zorro.  Tyrone Power plays it to the hilt, and is especially good in his alter ego of the effeminate fop, Don Diego.  He may not be quite as acrobatic as Fairbanks was in the original silent version but it doesn't detract from the performance.  And Power was a fencer, so his sword fighting scenes certainly rang true.  Put him with that elegant gentleman, Basil Rathbone, also an excellent swordsman, and you get one of the best sword fights in film history.  Rathbone is the other shining star of this film.  He oozes evil and was the master of the condescending sneer.  The supporting cast is impeccable.....Palette, Sondergaard, Bromberg, Love, and the young, extremely beautiful Linda Darnell.  It is curious to note that both Gale Sondergaard and J. Edward Bromberg were caught up in the Red Scare in Hollywood in the late 40'3, early 50's and their careers were basically destroyed by it.This is a rousing, fun film with great dialogue and should be on everyone's must see list.  One curious thing.......how did those very revealing tight pants worn by Power and Rathbone get by the Hays Office?  These were the days when you could not even show a married couple sharing the same bed and those pants didn't leave much to the imagination!

Don Diego does not disclose his abilities with the sword and disguises pretending that he is a sophisticated fashionable gay, for the heartache of his father. However, when he secretly wears a mask and rides a black horse, he becomes the avenger Zorro that carves his mark for the fearfulness of his enemies. The Mark of Zorro is the best Zorro of the cinema history in a time when the studios were concerned with the screenplay and acting and not CGI and sex scenes. The witty delightful story presents Tyrone Power as a fantastic the weak and fragile Don Diego Vega and the powerful Zorro, with totally different personalities. His ability as swordsman and rider is impressive in a perfect choreography of fights, recalling Errol Flynn in The Adventures of Robin Hood of two years before. Linda Darnell is so sweet and beautiful that seems to be the inspiration for the title of the novel of Vladimir Nabokov. J.

Tyrone Power is great in the title role, not only when in full swashbuckling action as Zorro, but also as the effeminate dandy Don Diego Vega, fanning his handkerchief, sneezing, and performing ridiculous magic tricks upon stupid prison wardens, when not courting the beautiful Alcalde's daughter Inez Quintero. You gotta love Zorro, the good old-fashioned hero of LA county, always prepared to fight for justice, fight poverty and save damsels in distress, occasionally engraving the mark Z, preferably on men's chest or cloth.There's enough innuendo and snappy dialog in here to keep adult audiences entertained as well as enough action for younger audiences to cherish this film (and even enough romance with dashing Power to keep the ladies satisfied). Basil Rathbone, as Captain Esteban Pasquale, makes a superb villain, always prepared to draw his sword, either for serious business or sadistic amusement. Most men have objects they play with. Churchmen have their beads; I toy with a sword.Wit Tyrone Power's undisputed comedic talent, he adds so much wit into his character (and to the already hilarious lines), the film is a real hoot. It's a shame Power embarked on more serious roles later in his career. With most of the lines ranging from the outright hilarious to marvelously corny, like Don Diego Vega's courting of the young lady Inez You're more lovely, more radiant than a morning in June, it's hard to take it all very serious, but when the fencing starts, playtime is over. Basil Rathbone, one of Hollywood's most skilled swordsmen, knows how to handle a sword like no-one else and Tyrone Power was quick to learn. The climactic swashbuckling scene between the two arch enemies in the small confined room of the Alcalde (brilliantly choreographed) is - till this very day - the best sword fight ever put on film, even surpassing the final fight between Rathbone and Errol Flynn, two years before in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (1938).Camera Obscura --- 9/10 "},{"Title":"Tyrone Power Badass In Black","Date":"8 June 2007","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" All I can say is Wow!

But this is undoubtedly the best film version about Johnston McCulley's famous fictional character. The film is presented in spades&#x97;it's perfectly cast and is lively directed by the innovative Rouben Mamoulian. Plus, it's great fun and stars a dashing Tyrone Power in his prime.Whereas the majority of today's superhero films are overabundant with style over substance in order to satisfy the toy business, THE MARK OF ZORRO ignores much of these visual extravagances and focuses mainly on the characters. All the characters, including the villains, are fleshed out and have good depth to them. This primary focus on the characters&#x97;rather than on action and special effects&#x97;is one of many reasons that make this film superior to the contemporary Zorro films starring Antonio Banderas.However, there are several excellent action scenes throughout, particularly the final duel scene between Diego Vega (Tyrone Power) and Captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone). It's performed inside an office with plenty of props and candles about in order to give the characters plenty of obstacles throughout the duel. In order to heighten the suspense and realism, there is an absence of a music score in this scene. The intense duel scene between Power and Rathbone reminds me so much of the final duel with my fencing rival in high school fencing class. I won that last duel, which lasted almost two minutes&#x85;but back to the film, since I'm digressing here.However, Vega has more screen time than his masked alter-ego here, since we learn about Vega's motives and how Zorro affects the community in this film. But through Vega we experience the everyday realities of the character, making Vega a very believable character despite his adventurous alter-ego. But Vega is a colorful, amusing character who masquerades as a cowardly fop whenever he takes the mask off. Since Tyrone Power loved making this movie and played his role with such obvious enthusiasm, I believe that he is the ideal Zorro actor despite his American accent.However, the other cast members are also excellent&#x97;including the amusing Eugene Palette, the sinister Basil Rathbone, the sly Gale Sondergaard, and the bumbling Edward J. Bromberg. I should also give special mention to the lovely Linda Darnell, who plays Vega's love interest and Zorro's secret admirer, and kudos to Montagu Love as Vega's stern father and the former governor of Los Angeles. Alfred Newman's Oscar-nominated music score is memorable and Arthur C. Miller's black-and-white cinematography is very atmospheric here, giving the Zorro segments a sense of menace.Due to the film's use of black-and-white and the limited appearance of its title character, I don't know if this film would appeal to the BATMAN BEGINS generation. It's too bad that they're really missing something here, since THE MARK OF ZORRO is still terrific entertainment today. Plus, the film clocks around at a short 93 minutes and does not suffer the tedious length of the Zorro films with Banderas.A very worthwhile film, although it might be a tad less effective than the greatest swashbuckler of them all, THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (1938).

Tyrone Power is great in the lead role. He plays the hero/ fop in much the same way as Leslie Howard did in the Scarlet Pimpernel- although, I have to admit, I think Power's is far superior to Howard's. There are some wonderful witty lines, most of which the fans have already pointed out, including Captain Paquale's oh dear, his bath water was tepid. It looks like poor Lolita's married life will turn out to be the same. Another one of my favourite scenes is the one where Rathbone's villain , after winning Eugene Palette in a sword fence, remarks, you should have become a soldier rather than a man of the church. He then opens a chest containing the taxes that Zorro has reclaimed, exclaiming, Santa Maria! No wonder you chose the church! Rathbone's Captain Pasquale is a great character, brilliantly written and acted (it's amazing to think that he was 21 years older than Tyrone Power, but still made a brilliant fencing opponent). Gale Sondergaard, who plays Inez Qunitero, was to appear opposite Rathbone again in Sherlock Holmes and the Spider Woman. All of the characters are wonderfully cast in this brilliant example of a good, old fashioned swashbuckler, the kind they can't seem to make any more.

Add to that list Diego De La Vega, who as Zorro is the secret hero of the story, and with his wits and swordsmanship takes on and overturns a local tyrant governor and his military aide in old California. The role would be played by many people starting with Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and going to Tyrone Power, George Hamilton, and Antonio Banderas. Indeed now, to keep up with current trends, Zorro's wife is as good a swords-person as he is.The version in this 1940 production was directed by Rouben Mamoulian, and it has been criticized (why, I have never understood) as being too still. Certainly it lacks some of the athletic tricks the 1920 silent version had due to Doug Fairbanks, but the action is fast enough. And it presented a fascinating dual role for star Tyrone Power, and gave enough early 19th Century Spanish-American/Mexican-American background to satisfy Mamoulian's love of stylistic sets and direction.Power is the son of Montague Love, and has been sent to Spain for his education. Love was the Alcalde of the town Power came from in California, but when he returns he discovers Love was replaced (we never exactly learn how), and the new governor (J. Edward Bromberg) and his wife (Gale Sondergaard) are a pair of vultures who are stealing everything they can from the local population through heavy taxes - with a large share going to their military aide (Basil Rathbone). Rathbone is quite a good swordsman, and quite ruthless. He sees no reason not to use force on the locals to tow the line. And nobody is around to stop him.The only possible brake on them is Eugene Palette, the local mission father - thus representing the Roman Catholic Church, but while they can't act against him they can ignore his anger. Love and his cronies have to keep quiet or their lands will be seized.Nobody knows that Power became a brilliant swordsman in Spain, and was even offered a military post there. When he returns he decides to fully pretend that Spain emasculated the splendid boy he once was as a young kid, and left him a tepid and tired fop. His biggest social claim is a tired joke about his handkerchief. This relieves (or is dismissed by) the villains. Rathbone, in particular, would love to face a worthy sword foe-man (we constantly see Basil prepping himself for fighting, and at one point he anxiously inquires if Power fancies the sword as a weapon). Love is disappointed by this worthless fop who has returned, as is Palette.Then, a mysterious night rider comes around the area and starts beating up and running through various troops sent to collect taxes or other forms of extortion. The masked rider calls himself Zorro, and only Palette learns it is Power. He goes from one escapade to another, including robbing Bromberg and Sondergaard in their coach. At the same time, while goading Esteban (Rathbone) by showing how ineffective the latter is in keeping the lid on the kettle, Power also twits the latter by becoming a romantic rival to the latter over the niece of Bromberg and Sondergaard (Linda Darnell). Nice touches abound in this film. This is the swordsmanship film where Power uses his sword to cut a set of candles in half without them apparently moving (Rathbone supposedly cut them in half but his halves fell to the floor). It also has moments of comedy - Rathbone finding Bromberg in his office tied up and blindfolded with a sword at his throat (placed there by Power before he left), asks the alcalde if he is trying to commit suicide!Altogether a very superior adventure story.

But, of course, he is, in reality, Zorro, the masked savior who rights all wrongs and eventually wins the day. To enjoy this film it is, of course, necessary to suspend reality, such as not quibbling about why he is not recognized simply because he wears a mask but is exactly the same physical size and voice of Don Diego.

After putting together the list, I noticed that, while I had referenced this specific film in other reviews (most especially my take on the modern Anthony Hopkins re-do where, mysteriously, younger viewers WHO HAD NEVER SEEN THIS VERSION became somewhat irritated at my calling the Hopkins version an abomination, even though I did provide detailed reasons..) I had neglected to actually review this film for IMDb. Mea culpa. I have seen the film a dozen times, I own two DVD copies, so here we go 1. The Zorro legend commands respect, which means essentially don't monkey with it, as (for example) having two Zorros in the same film (not going to mention any names, you figure out what I am talking about). When A&E did a biography of Zorro, they opined that he was likely the first ever superhero because of his great skill and the secret identity. No argument from me. 2. This version is very faithful to the original story, with brilliant casting (some say Power's best film, period) and flawless direction by Rouben Mamoulian. Darnell is perfect as the shy young damsel who becomes progressively less shy when she has a chance to snag the man of her dreams. Rathbone (who, to be fair, did make a wonderful Holmes) is UNFORGETTABLE as the bad guy. 3. The climax represents the best of everything Hollywood stood for in the period. When Power decides to forgo the secret identity and challenge Rathbone outright, there ensues THE LONGEST AND MOST PERFECTLY FILMED SWORD FIGHT IN Hollywood HISTORY to that point in time. 4.

It's also the quintessential swashbuckler, with a simple yet thoroughly absorbing plot, a delightfully witty script and all the expertise of a Hollywood studio at its best - with luminous cinematography by Arthur Miller and a rousing, instantly-recognizable score by Alfred Newman.In the accompanying Audio Commentary - a relaxed but generally insightful track - Richard Schickel argues that the film was a relatively modest undertaking (but, following its runaway box-office success, Fox then upped the ante for subsequent epics) mostly limited to cramped interior sets and rather short on action for its genre; as for myself, I was never bothered by these elements at all and, in fact, I hadn't even thought of such 'shortcomings' before Schickel mentioned them! Another interesting comment he makes regards the script's consciously ironic depiction of Old California as a rural sleepy town, a direct contrast to the bustling film-making center it would soon grow up to be!Tyrone Power is ideally cast in the dual-natured title role (as fop and avenger), and he subsequently became synonymous with such action fare. The supporting line-up is equally satisfying Basil Rathbone's villainy here was seldom bettered (by himself or anyone else); J. Edward Bromberg is the corrupt ruler who is willingly manipulated by the latter - but his essential buffoonery is, ultimately, revealed to have been merely deceptive; Linda Darnell (one of Hollywood's loveliest leading ladies of the 1940s and just 17 when this film was made!) is a most charming heroine; Gale Sondergaard and Eugene Palette expertly fill their typical respective roles.Rouben Mamoulian was once recognized among Hollywood's foremost stylists his career had proved somewhat spotty after an initial splurge of innovation but, even if conventional by his usual standards, the director regained some of his former stature with this classic; actually, it emerged as the last wholly satisfying film he would ever make - despite being followed immediately by another collaboration with Power and Darnell that was similarly inspired by a Silent success, the Rudolph Valentino vehicle BLOOD AND SAND (1922).For the record, the only other Tyrone Power film in my DVD collection is his own personal favorite, NIGHTMARE ALLEY (1947; via Eureka's R2 Masters Of Cinema edition, which is superior to the R1 Fox Film Noir disc), though I've yet to check it out. Thankfully, a good number of his best-known vehicles have been blessed with a SE DVD by Fox - so I still need to pick up ALEXANDER'S RAGTIME BAND (1938), IN OLD CHICAGO (1938), THE RAINS CAME (1939), BRIGHAM YOUNG (1940), THE BLACK SWAN (1942; his most notable adventure film after THE MARK OF ZORRO) and THE RAZOR'S EDGE (1946). Besides, others like JESSE JAMES (1939), BLOOD AND SAND itself and THE SUN ALSO RISES (1957) are forthcoming - though, as yet, no supplements have been announced.

The bad guys include J.Edward Bromberg in a very funny turn as the corrupt governor, and Basil Rathbone as a hot-blooded military officer who is romancing the governor's vain wife, Gale Sondergaard, on the side. George Regas is a menacing Sergeant Gonzales, threatening to flog the peons if they don't pay the outrageous taxes. Against this despotic crew stands Eugene Palette as a blunt spoken monk who utters violent threats against the governor, always followed by a quick  God forgive me. Montagu Love is the stern, honorable former governor, appalled by the antics of his foppish twit of a son, Tyrone Power, who plays the fool by day and terrorizes the villains by night as the sword-wielding bandit Zorro. Power makes an ideal hero, handsome and charming enough to make lovely senorita Linda Darnell lose her heart to him, while credibly acrobatic and risk taking to defy the authorities with his hairsbreadth escapes and cunning tricks. The sequence in which Power and Rathbone finally engage in a duel to the death is perhaps the most exciting sword fight ever filmed. The clash of steel, the snarled threats and witticisms between the foes, the fight taking place in a confined space, where the combatants crash into furniture and trip on rugs, the absence of music making the scene more tense, are all enough to rouse the most jaded audience. This is a truly great swashbuckler that should not be missed by classic movie fans. It has a hyper romantic love story, comedy and incredible action scenes, along with a wonderful score by Alfred Newman that adds greatly to the colorful atmosphere. One has only to see Tyrone Power in this movie to understand how he became a star. As for Linda Darnell, she is so stunningly beautiful and plays her innocent character so believably, that one never finds her too pure to be real. Basil Rathbone makes the most of his sinister role, displaying a passion and steely anger that might surprise viewers who have only seen him as the dry, intellectual Sherlock Holmes.

Why, of all the illiterate phonies!","Date":"27 June 2008","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" THE Pulp Magazine story writer, Johnston McCulley had his story, The Ghost of Capistrtano published in a serialized version in All Story Weekly Magazine in 1920. The main character was Diego de la Vega, another in the line Rich Man Idlers; who secretly don a masked disguise in order to hide their true identities, while they heroically lead in combating some great injustice, crime or even a tyrannical monarch or government.THAT Mr. McCulley's swashbuckling Zorro was an instant success and obvious potential in adaptation to the Silver Screen; was instantly apparent to THE Preeminent Swashbuckler of the Silent Screen. It has been said that following his marriage to Miss Mary Pickford, Doug spent a great deal of their Honeymoon in reading over the story, familiarizing himself with the story , learning the character that he may do his own film; which would also be the character's debut in the Movies.IT was just that easy for Mr. Fairbanks at this particular stage of his film career to get the starring vehicle that he wanted. And just why could he accomplish getting such ambitious projects done so easily? Well, you see Schultz, Douglas Fairbanks had his own Production Company. Furthermore, Fairbanks, along with Mary Pickford, Charles Chaplin and D.W. Griffith got together in 1919 to form the United Artists Corporation to handle their (and others') distribution. Ergo, it was only about a year from being published in All-Story Weekly that Zorro bowed on in the Movie Houses. THE MARK OF ZORRO (Douglas Fairbanks Productions/United Artists Corporation, 1920) was the resulting title. It's good to be King! THE story of a peoples' struggle in 1820's Spanish California and the Fairbanks' upbeat, athletic portrayal made this ZORRO Debut an instant Classic and created demand for both more stories and more flicks. Much like Edgar Rice Burroughs' TARZAN, the popularity of ZORRO demanded more tales of a character that was intended to be a one shot only. Mr. McCulley wrote many more stories, which pleased the Pulp Magazine reading set very much.NOT to be left out in the cold and let the character grow cold, Republic Pictures Corporation, they of the famous Thrill Factory assembly line of B Westerns and Serials, secured the rights from McCulley to do some pictures; including the splendid ZORRO'S FIGHTING LEGION (Republic, 1939), with Reed Hadley in the lead.THE following year, we were treated to a top shelf, Grade 'A', Big Budget film starring Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell. It was, much like so many other Hollywood a remake of sorts (mainly in the title), as THE MARK OF ZORRO (20th Century-Fox, 1940) packed 'em in wherever it played. It was adventure on the grand scale; ranking it right up there with CAPTAIN BLOOD (Warner Brothers, 1935), THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (Warner Brothers, 1938) and THE SEAHAWK (Warner Brothers, 1940). Now, that's not bad company to be in.BEING cast in the lead of this Swashbuckler, Tyrone Power did his best to offer us a foppish Diego and a brave, intelligent and noble Zorro. Linda Darnell is both believable and at once other worldly as the beautiful, lonely Lolita Quintero. J. Edward Bromberg and Gale Sondregaard is a convincing villain couple. There is a presence of three players carried over from THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD; with Montagu Love as Don Alejandro de la Vega (Zorro's Paw!), Basil Rathbone* as the villainous Capitan Esteban Pasquale (in English, Steve Easter?) and, in an almost total reprise of his Friar Tuck, Eugene Palette as Padre Felipe.** THE action was truly exciting, the sets were authentic Spanish Californian, the Costuming believable and the original theme and score by Alfred Newman, David Buttolph, Hugo Friedhofer and Cyril Mockridge fits the story like a glove and underscores the mood of the story throughout. *** THIS version of THE MARK OF ZORRO brought the character to new heights; from the common, vulgar Pulp Magazine pages to the heights as the fine Film Franchise that is great Box Office, right down to the present.NOTE * Mr. Basil Rathbone was known to be the finest fencer in the films; yet, the movies' being the make believe world that it is, he lost duels to so many heroes in climaxing scenes. These defeats included his losing life to people such as our Tyrone Power's Zorro and as many an Errol Flynn adversary.NOTE ** Padre Felipe is a virtual clone of Mr. Palette's Friar Tuck from the ROBIN HOOD film. They are both rough, tough and gruff brawling swordsmen; who just happen to also be Members of the Clergy.NOTE *** Mr. Newman, who is also usually credited as being 20th Century-Fox's Musical Director, is the only one composer to be mentioned in the credits. (His opening Theme, which seems to recur in every action segment, is haunting and was used in at least one MARK remake for TV). But the other three were busy in apparently making incidental music throughout.POODLE SCHNITZ!!

Their fast paced and graceful duel with blades is definitely the high point for me of this Zorro film, the first significant version after the silent era brought us two excellent versions produced by star Douglas Fairbanks. Although Power doesn't have the raw athleticism of Fairbanks (who does?), he's an excellent fencer and his screen personality is well suited to the role. Just as with Fairbanks in his version of Mark of Zorro, we get to see Power play both a foppish nobleman and the secret identity of Zorro. This provides an interesting set of layers to the film in the sense that Don Diego Vega only shows his true self when he wears the mask and presents his disguise when he shows his true face. It also provides room for situational comedy, since his beloved, Lolita Quintero (Linda Darnell), must not know this secret too soon. This film doesn't mine it quite as fully as Fairbanks' in which the secret is not revealed until very close to the conclusion&#133; probably the producers felt that the conceit was a bit too thin to hold up over the length of the entire picture and that the romance would suffer because of it. Regardless it's an interesting sign of the changes in audience tastes after the silent era and the perception that pure melodrama could not sustain a picture in the modern 1940s film atmosphere.Arthur Miller's photography is good and Alfred Newman's music is suitable but not overwhelming in quality like so many of his scores. A lot of the look and feel of the film's pseudo-Spanish atmosphere was improved and enhanced with many of the same cast members in color for Blood and Sand. Director Mamoulian's sense of rhythm and pace is impeccable.Power's performance of course is the only one that really gets the focus of the film; even Darnell's maiden in distress is merely a functionary of his experiences and adventure. Rathbone does some good work in a pretty easy role for him. The most surprising work in this film comes from Gale Sondergaard, who provides a very believable turn as the wife of the corrupt regional governor (J. Edward Bromberg) who imagines herself as a kind of demimonde or woman of the world. The dinner scene with the wife, the governor, Don Vega and Capt. Pasquale is probably the most interesting in the film from a character standpoint, because we have these two very macho men seemingly battling for the attention of Sondergaard's vain wife while the fat corrupt husband watches. Even given his stupidity, it's impossible to think that the governor isn't aware of what's happening and that lends the film a slight edge of moral iniquity. The conflict also adds to the negative chemistry between Vega and Pasquale. And it's interesting to watch from the perspective that even though Vega/Zorro is only pretending to be interested in Dona Quintero (Sondergaard), he's still able to win her from his rival &#150; how ironic! The film builds steadily to an exciting climax with Zorro and Capt. Pasquale in a fatal duel and the people of Los Angeles rising up against the oppressive governor. I'm sure this was supremely exciting for audiences in the early 40s and it still holds up as an action/adventure film today.

Set in Southern California during the early 19th century, the plot deals with Don Diego Vega/Zorro (Tyrone Power), who returned home to find that his town is being extorted by the Governor and his henchman Captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone).Diego then became the mask vigilante Zorro to be able to able to defend his people from the hand of the corrupt Governor.The Mark of Zorro is a true oldie; the score is so obvious and doesn't blend with the movie (from my own point of view) although the score did get an Academy Award nomination.The Mark of Zorro is one you can take the time to see even if it is just to see the duel between Power and Rathbone.www.lagsreviews.com "},{"Title":"This Marks Zorro-The Mark of Zorro ***","Date":"19 February 2013","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" Enjoyable 1940 film with Tyrone Power masquerading as Zorro, and also as a fop so as to fool family and everyone else.Power returns home from Spain to find a corrupt government over-taxing the populace.Of course, there is romance with him and Linda Darnell, the niece of the corrupt governor, J.Edward Bromberg and his henchman, the always mean and nasty Basil Rathbone.As the governor's wife, I found Gale Sondergaard most interesting here. Jealous of her niece's love for Power, Sondergaard has that sinister way that she could only have in motion pictures.My main fault with the film is that the ending comes quickly as the problems of what is occurring are resolved. Power acting as a fop in key scenes are hysterical at best. Bromberg's fear of Zorro is also well realized.

Many of the same elements are present, including a swashbuckling outlaw hero fighting against the ruthless and greedy forces of oppression while winning a beautiful and virtuous heroine. They even managed to engage many of the same supporting cast; including Eugene Palette reprising his role of the hero's priest-friend, Basil Rathbone as a sword-wielding villain, and Montague Love (as a good guy this time). Rathbone, in particular, stands out in one of his most effective portrayals in a long series of classic villains, one every bit as memorable as the one he portrayed in Robin Hood. The plot itself is a re-do of the classic 1920 silent film that cemented Douglas Fairbanks' reputation as an international film idol. With so much of The Mark of Zorro being a re-hash of elements that had been done before, it stands to reason that the production would have to have been carried off extremely well in order to have had any impact. In fact, it was done very well indeed. To star in a vehicle such as this you need an actor with great presence and charisma and, at that time, Tyrone Power had that in spades. He was clearly intended to be 20th Century Fox's answer to Errol Flynn, a role that he unquestionably pulled off, particularly in the period before the war (the Tyrone Power who returned from military service in the war was a far more mature actor, one less suited to the former swashbuckling roles). Power's Zorro is less athletic than Douglas Fairbanks' version, but then no actor, with the sole possible exception of Burt Lancaster, could ever hope to approach Fairbanks in that department. However, there is little dispute that Power was at his very best at the time he made The Mark of Zorro.Power's co-star, Linda Darnell, who was still only 17 years old, was just beginning the period of her best work when this film was made. Unfortunately, she was given little to do in this film, besides look beautiful (with which she had no trouble). It is also unfortunate for Darnell that she shared most of her scenes with one of the screen's finest character actresses, the much-unappreciated Gale Sondergaard. That is no aspersion on the talent of Darnell, because Sondergaard was fully capable of stealing scenes from the best scenery-chewers in the business, including the likes of Betty Davis and Claude Rains. For example, during the same period when Zorro was produced, Sondergaard was also featured in the cast of The Letter, in which she memorably dominated a scene shared with no less an acting presence than Bette Davis, and did it without even uttering a single word of dialogue!A movie like the The Mark of Zorro wouldn't work unless all the elements, actors, sets, costumes, music score and direction, come together. In this particular case, everything came together perfectly.

You know, the ones where you can always hear Alfred Newman's bombastic score. The Mask of Zorro opens with a title card saying, Madrid - when the Spanish Empire encompassed the globe, and young blades were taught the fine and fashionable art of killing&#x85; So what's that, like 18...30? 1840? I guess we'll figure it out. And so we do, of course. But there was an unabashed syrupy-ness about the melodramatic urgency given to these movies.When Zorro's not prancing around in his little cape eye-mask, he's playing the part of the utterly timid, and more than a touch effeminate, Don Diego Vega. The likelihood that Vega could be the remarkably expert swashbuckler never once dawns on the baddies, largely because Vega is such a stern little prude.The first big-budget talkie starring the swashbuckling samaritan, Rouben Mamoulian's old-fashioned jaunt was a blockbuster in 1940, and it remains recalled quite warmheartedly by the Silent Generation's moviegoers, and equally the small screen's fascinated beginners among the Baby Boom, as one of the period's very best adventure pictures. One grows accustomed to the movie's qualitative foothold in that time of matinée idols and sword-fighting silver-screen hero worship, and we can concede for that reason. But tolerant filmgoers will stay open for a movie that's considerably chock-a-block with romance, action, duplicity, and courageous bravado, all in an overstated manner that could've only been taken seriously in 1940, and perhaps not one year later.The nuts and bolts are all here Don Diego is invited to come home from Madrid to his family in Los Angeles, but upon his reappearance he learns that his father's standing as alcalde has been seized by the shameless Don Luis Quintero, a nasty piece of work who's nothing more than a minion to the man enjoying the real supremacy Captain Esteban Pasquale. As expected, Diego/Zorro means to linger in Los Angeles just long enough to depose the scoundrels, entice a pretty slice of illicit fruit, and bring integrity to his family's native soil. Nothing ground-breaking here, but there's nothing amiss in a straightforward adventure yarn told in the traditional way. "},{"Title":"The Movie of Zest","Date":"25 July 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" After almost seven decades THE MARK OF ZORRO by Rouben Mamoulian still thrills, delights, astonishes and mesmerizes a large audience. Such cinematic adaptations, indeed, deserve to be called 'incomparable' and superior versions where any attempt at a remake is destined to be a failure. Although the story of the Californian Robin Hood had been brought to screen in the silent era by Fred Niblo and was, years later transformed into THE MASK OF ZORRO, Rouben Mamoulian's movie with Tyrone Power in the lead remains a superior version that I call 'The Movie of Zest.' Why? Such a content as in Johnston McCulley's 1919 story THE CURSE OF CAPISTRANO (that is where the fictional character Zorro first appeared) does not require much effort to see, much psychology where its zestful aim would turn into a reflective one. Such a movie primarily offers to us, gives us tension and characters goodies and baddies, of course, 'angels' and 'scorpions' so that blood can run faster in our veins as we are watching their clashes and cross our fingers for the heroes. There are better or worse films in that respect but truly seldom can we find an equally overwhelming film as THE MARK OF ZORRO which really does its best thanks to excellent cast and a terrific character development. Let me discuss this aspect in more details.While THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD was a 'tour De force' for Errol Flynn, THE MARK OF ZORRO is a true 'tour De force' for Tyrone Power. He gives the most heroic, the most sympathetic, the emotionally and skillfully flawless performance as foppish Don Diego/mysterious Zorro. Tyrone Power crafts the very gist of his role(s), of his disguises creating an unforgettable picture in us. He builds a perfect tension in the viewers that does not fade till the end. And the rest that are with or against Zorro ......with his spirit comes Fray Felipe beautifully and humorously portrayed by Eugene Palette. He is the one of the flaming wrath, holy wrath. He is the one whose fruit is neither an enemy nor a rival; the one who awaits an angel with a flaming sword to come and fight fire with fire. Consider, for instance, the scene when he talks to Don Diego about the violent and corrupt government....with his heart comes a delicious Lolita, 'more lovely and more radiant than a morning in June,' sensually portrayed by Ms Darnell. Her image with a sweet white kitten has a powerful visual effect. Although this was the heyday of the code in Hollywood (1941), Ms Darnell is extremely sexy but perfectly decent. Here's another evidence for one true fact she can have all clothes on and still give the most erotic performance. The terrific on-screen chemistry between Ms Darnell and Mr Power is worth attention with their best two scenes the 'Sombrero Blanco' dance and the chapel scene. No wonder the young swordsman and a mysterious vigilante does not hesitate to marry her, raise fat children with her and watch their vineyards grow......with his sentiments comes Don Alejandro Vega (Montagu Love), his father, the deposed Alcalde, more loyal, more delicate. He seems helpless when seeing the people starve and desperate when his beloved son just makes the first steps toward making him a grandfather......against his morals come the violent and corrupt government, in particular 'His Excellency' Don Luis Quintero (J. Edward Bromberg), the new Alcalde who is cowardly and blood drunk; and the cruel captain Esteban Pasquale (Basil Rathbone), the true villain, a swordsman of evil for whom that poor fruit is not an enemy but merely a rival, who delights in terrorizing people by high taxation. The duel scene which has become, in a way, a symbol of this film is the climax of tension and the heights of thrill. While J. Edward Bromberg gives a memorable performance as Don Luis Quintenero, Basil Rathbone shines in the role, gives the clearest indication where evil lies, appears to portray a true evil's incarnate....with him, finally, come the people of Los Angeles, the people fighting for justice, and also the people who have great zest for his story and for the wonderful screen adaptation with masterful direction and acting.

Somehow or other this classic had passed me by down the years and given that it was in my top 10 films to see before I die, I wasn't going to waste the opportunity this time.Well, you can tell from my mark and summary above that I wasn't disappointed. It has everything you want from a Boys' Own Adventure and successfully crosses winning elements from The Scarlet Pimpernel and Robin Hood - with the hero, a mild-mannered fop in everyday life who transforms into the dynamic swashbuckling avenger taking up arms against a comically-tyrannic overlord (a highly amusing J Edward Bromberg) and his nasty ace-swordsman lieutenant, (the peerless Basil Rathbone), who has a series of hair-raising adventures before naturally getting captured only to escape death in the final reel, get the beautiful girl and restore order within his family and for all of his countrymen to boot.The action sequences are terrific and include a great escape when Zorro jumps his horse off a bridge into a stream below and a wonderfully exciting climactic sword-fight between Power & Rathbone ending with Rathbone's very realistic death.Tyrone Power goes easily from fey to fearless and is a match for Flynn in almost every respect while Linda Darnell, while lacking the winsome allure of Olivia De Havilland nevertheless provides a suitably attractive reward for the hero's efforts. Special mention to Eugene Palette for his scene-stealing role as the gruff-voiced priest who Friar Tuck-style bashes villainous heads even as he admonishes himself in the act.There's plenty of humour on board and the musical score is suitably uplifting, especially Zorro's theme whenever he enters the scene.All in all, just one of the best, most exhilarating and enjoyable films I've yet seen, effortlessly directed by old master Rouben Mamoullian who obviously knows a thing or two about lighting sets as well as condensing this rollicking tale into ninety blink-and-they're-gone minutes. Wish they'd made it in colour though, like Curtiz's The Adventures of Robin Hood! "},{"Title":"Have you seen this one?","Date":"29 October 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" According to comic book mythology, this 1940 version of the Mark of Zorro was the movie Bruce Wayne went to see the night his parents were killed, and which inspired him to create his Batman alter ego. Although such timeless tales as Robin Hood and the Three Musketeers have been revived more often, Zorro will always have a special affinity with the comic book superhero, being the original wimp-by-day and masked-crusader-by-night.In the late 30s and early 40s there was a massive resurgence in the swashbuckling adventure genre, borne almost entirely upon the shoulders of Errol Flynn at Warner Brothers and Tyrone Power at Fox. It was a type of picture that had been out of fashion since Douglas Fairbanks Sr. hung up his sword in 1929, and Tyrone Power was here stepping into a role that Fairbanks had made famous two decades earlier. While most of the swashbucklers (especially the Errol Flynn ones) were becoming increasingly grand and ostentatious, the Mark of Zorro is a relatively modest affair. There are no vast sets or pyrotechnics, no big crowds of extras (at least not until the very end) and not even that much action. Instead there are several mean standoffs in which the protagonists spar verbally or just stare each other down. The obligatory sword duel does not take place in a grand hall or upon the decks of a galleon as it would in the typical swashbuckler, but in a cramped office. True, this fight is not exactly breathtaking, but it has a level of intensity not seen in those other pictures, as the duellists constantly find themselves trapped against a wall. This tension is heightened because the musical score is silent during this sequence (Darryl F. Zanuck was one of the few producers of this era bold enough to use absence of music), so all we hear is the clanging of steel on steel.Director Rouben Mamoulian was something of show-off, and his excessive style spoiled a fair few of his pictures. Luckily, by this point he was learning some serious technique and reining things in a bit. What's more, a picture like Mark of Zorro actually benefits from what is left of Mamoulian's flamboyance. The stylised sense of rhythm, the expressive shot compositions and the hammy theatrical acting performances that Mamoulian seems to have loved give the picture the feel of a fable, which is just what these adventures were &#x96; something Douglas Fairbanks knew full well. When we see peons wakened from their sleep, a dozen sombreros nodding as one just before Zorro makes his first spectacular entrance, it looks like a piece of ballet. Magical moments like that are rarely seen in the swashbucklers of the period, but again this harks back to Doug Fairbanks, who more danced than acted his way through each role.And now we come to the actors. It's a shame to say it, but Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell seem a somewhat cynical pairing. They are quite literally two of the most beautiful people in Hollywood, yet as performers neither rose above mediocrity. Yet around these two disappointingly wooden leads stand a fine crop of excellent supporting players. We have hissable villain Basil Rathbone, sly seductress Gale Sondergaard and podgy padre Eugene Palette, to name but three. They seem to enjoy getting stuck into their clichéd roles (not to mention the scenery), and we accept their lack of realism because we enjoy watching them do it.Great as this edition of Zorro is, it has one important difference to the Douglas Fairbanks movie from 1920, and to the aforementioned Batman story. I'm reminded here of David Carradine's speech towards the end of Kill Bill vol. 2 about the two different kinds of superhero. In the Fairbanks version, it's implied that the fussy fop Diego is the real man, and Zorro is an act he has to adopt to commit acts of bravery. The Fairbanks Zorro is the Bruce Wayne/Batman or Peter Parker/Spiderman kind of superhero &#x96; a weak and inept person who has to put on a costume to become a hero. But with Tyrone Power in 1940, we see the character's back-story. The real Diego is already a dashing hero. The foppish weakling is an act which he events, and by becoming Zorro he is just becoming his real self, albeit in disguise. This makes a hero of the Superman/Clark Kent variety &#x96; a genuine hero who adopts an unassuming disguise. Which of the two types is more inspiring and sympathetic to the audience? I would disagree with Bill, and say the former.

Everything here is near perfect. Tyrone Power cuts a dashing figure, both as the fop Diego, and the swashbuckling hero. He exudes charm and grace, as a romantic hero should. Basil Rathbone is deliciously evil, sharp with tongue or sword. No one sneers quite like him.The film really sets the standard, with great costumes, staging, and wonderful action. We are slowly teased with the oppression and corruption, until Zorro makes his entrance. Then, things take off at a gallop. Suspense builds as Esteban's forces close in on Zorro, until he makes his escape. We watch as romance builds and plots are hatched. The suspense builds until the final duel between Diego and Esteban, and what a duel it is. Rathbone was a master fencer and Power is no slouch (although not quite Flynn). The timing is somewhat manipulated, but very exciting. The ending is rousing and satisfying.They don't make films like this anymore, and it's probably just as well. There are few actors these days who could pull off this combination of romance, adventure, and screen presence. Antonio Banderas made a good try, but there were too many modern trappings.

And seeing The Mark of Zorro (1940), one can see plainly how it could inspire. It looks like a smaller production than 1998's The Mask of Zorro (only a one-letter difference in the title), but The Mark of Zorro has solid production values and plenty of life and action anyway. It thus does as much justice to the character of Zorro as Zorro did for California.Tyrone Power plays Don Diego Vega, a master swordsman who returns to California from Spain, only to find his governor father overthrown and replaced by a tyrant. Power succeeds in portraying a character with a double life, a foppish Don Diego Vega and a heroic Zorro. One thing I thought was a little lacking was why he chose to take the form of a masked bandit or why he chose the name Zorro. And doesn't the fact that Zorro explicitly wants his father back on the throne make Don Diego Vega a little suspicious? On the other hand, the way he acts unmasked would take a little away from any suspicion. The film has plenty of swashbuckling action scenes that offer excitement without gore; with a dash of romance and sex appeal (Zorro falls in love with his enemy's beautiful young niece, kind of like how the new Zorro loves his enemy's adopted daughter in the 1998 film).

Don Luis is himself influenced by the ambitious Captain Esteban Pasquale (Rathbone) and his scheming wife Inez (Gale Sondergaard).Seeing the people's anguish, Don Diego adopts a foppish persona to mask his attempts to overthrow the regime as the bold caballero Zorro. Don Diego becomes acquainted with Don Luis' comely young niece Lolita (an interesting choice of names) as played by the very young and very beautiful Linda Darnell. Zorro allies himself with the local padre (Eugene Pallete) in recovering the evil Alcalde's taxes taken from the starving peasants. After Zorro frightens Don Luis to the point of having him resign, Don Diego is challenged by Captain Pasquale to a duel to the finish thereby revealing his secret identity.The duel between Power and Rathbone is the highlight of the film and one of the greatest of such sword fights ever filmed. Rathbone, who was 20 years Power's senior was nonetheless an expert swordsman and probably could have bested any of his on screen opponents (including Errol Flynn) in combat. Power had taken fencing lessons along the way and doesn't look out of place here.Gale Sondergaard was one of evilest of female villains of the 1940s, although she is not given much to do here. She would appear as The Spider Women with Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes in 1944's The Spider Woman. Montegu Love had been on the business end of John Barrymore's sword in Don Juan (1925). Eugene Palette had played a sword wielding friar previously in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), which by the way contains another classic duel between Rathbone and Errol Flynn.The Mark of Zorro appears to have been modestly produced, in Black and White and on the Fox back lot. It has way too many interior scenes and even the climatic duel is confined to one room. But it does have the handsome Power just emerging as a super star and the gorgeous Miss Darnell as the love interest.Avoid the computer colorized version of this film.

However, even without three-strip Technicolor, this B&W version of the famous legendary outlaw is acted to perfection by the entire cast.Tyrone Power goes with great ease from the fop to the swashbuckler Zorro, all the while displaying a great deal of charm and good looks. The romantic role of the girl goes to Linda Darnell who is more than adequate in the looks department herself.In the chapel scene and The White Sombrero dance routine they have a chance to show the kind of sparks that made them popular movie stars of the '40s. Linda was just about to break out of her virginal roles and about to play more tempestuous heroines, but she does an excellent job as Power's love interest.Basil Rathbone is at his finest for the final dueling scene, surely even more robustly performed than the one he shared with Errol Flynn in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD--and that's really saying something. Power seems to be evenly matched with Rathbone in his skilled swordsmanship.Alfred Newman's fitting pseudo-Spanish background music provides just the right amount of excitement to make this a most entertaining show. And the supporting cast--including Gale Sondergaard, J. Edgar Bromberg, Eugene Palette, Montagu Love, Janet Beecher and others is excellent.By all means worth watching anytime for sheer entertainment.

Now see it all in full glory and beneficent grandeur.Okay, okay. It's only Tyrone Power as Z-, Zorro. Yes, that grand fellow. But, basically he's just a guy who goes home to old California from Spain to visit his family. Upon arrival, he finds his father is no longer governing the territory, but instead a corrupt little man who has put the fear of God into his people with high taxes and unbearable living conditions. Sound familiar? When Tyrone sees just how bad it is and no solution in sight, he takes it upon himself to save the day, provided he can find some black cloth to disguise himself with, and then he becomes Zorro, to steal from the rich to help the poor.This is an unusual entry for an older movie, as there were screwball comedies at the time, but nothing like this with all its campy, tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top antics. Example Basil Rathbone and J. Edward Bromberg as the new governor are discussing policy and what to do about Zorro, when Basil starts rolling a decorative big, round ball on display, The governor stops it, as it distracts him. They continue talking. Basil starts it, only for the governor to stop it again. They continue talking. Basil starts it. Now the governor immersed in his misery and predicament lets it keep going. It seems minute now, but watching it is a hoot and is reminiscent of Mel Brooks and Chaplin's The Great Dictator. Also, Bromberg, who is great as the governor, is even afraid to speak the name, Zorro.Ty as Zorro meets Linda Darnell and falls in love with her and she him, but his father (played to the hilt by Montagu Love and is great) is totally against her, because she is the daughter of the corrupt governor. His exasperation of all the idiots around him is priceless. I can still see him saying, This is outrageous. Can you tell I like this movie? If you want to know all there is about Zorro, watch this and then nothing else will compare. Not even Antonio Banderas!!!

I heard about Zorro when the Banderas movies came out but somehow never got to see them. But when I saw this Tyrone Power movie in a store, I decided to buy it sight unseen. I did the same with Pirates of the Caribbean and in each case a winner.I have seen Tyrone Power in probably a couple of other movies, when I was a child, so I wasn't entirely unaware of him, but I was stunned by how good he is. A real superstar. No wonder he is so famous. And the swordfight between Power and Rathbone is quite the best I've seen in a movie. I did just a little fencing and find it fascinating so it was wonderful to see a really clever match between two experts - in a confined space, no histrionics or acrobatics or slashe, just fine swordplay. I enjoyed this even more than Errol Flynn's swordfighting. I do enjoy the acrobatics and slashe and so on in swashbucklers, but this match was a delight for the purists.My DVD is the 2-set with the excellent colourised version. I do wish they would colourise a lot more of the old movies. It's the first time I've ever seen one and I've yet to find another. It's fine I think when the original is also provided if the punter prefers that.The story is superbly done. Power as the fop vs Power as the hero - stirring stuff and so amusing. I think Banderas makes a good job of Diego's successor but surely this Power version is the best of all? It did spoil me just a bit for Anthony Hopkins playing Diego in the recent sequel - he was excellent in the part for sure, but I really wanted to see a Tyrone Power lookalike!I also enjoyed the original book The Curse of Capistrano, and the Isobel Allende spin-off book about Zorro's youth. Spoiler......It also took me a little while to discover why Hopkins wife had a different name to Power's wife and the age difference between them. But I learned it was the usual writer's dodge. Kill off the first girlfriend/wife or remove her so the hero can have lots of love affairs before taking on another wife.... Looking forward to see Son of Zorro - The delightful Joaquim is surely set up for a taking-over-as-Zorro from Dad movie in due course?

Like Beatty did with Clyde, Power makes Zorro the Latin rengegade you can't help but like, and actually admire. Because the Zorro presents is nothing more nor less than a good man seeking reparation for the injury visited not only upon himself, but upon his family, to whom he feels justice is now due. It's a very credible and believable portrayal, though under close scrutiny his Zorro may come across as somewhat idealistically unflawed. Then again, within the time frame of this story, we are seeing a man adamant and single-minded of purpose, and the depth Power brings to the character more than accounts for what may be construed as a flawless nature.Viva la Mexico!

He may not be Emiliano Zapata, but clearly Zorro's motivations are reformist and well-intentioned.  Liberating the peasantry is the stuff of another film.

This 1940 production of The MARK OF ZORRO is the most handsomely turned-out version of this tale of old California.  Like the SCARLET PIMPERNEL, it is a tale of hidden identity, and of good over evil.Tyrone Power plays Don Diego de la Vega, the scion of well-to-do California family.  Away in Madrid at some Academy of war-fare, he is summoned home by his worried father to aid the good people of the region against an oppressive regime that has seized political power.  As the ruthless and dangerous Basil Rathbone  silkily informs Don Diego when he first returns, Your father has resigned, Don Diego,.......age you know.  Since then the peons have become more industrious.  As for the caballeros, they are encouraged to think of their own affairs....WE TAKE CARE OF THE GOVERNMENT!Sizing up the situation and not wanting to tip his hand, Don Diego retreats into the persona of a fop and dandy.  This device contributes to much of the film's witty and extremely humorous fun. The beauty here is that we are the only ones let-in on this charade.  Don Diego begins on a campaign to frighten the puppet governor, Don Luis Quintero into fleeing to Madrid and appointing the older Vega (his father)to the post.  He does this by staging little terrorist attacks on soldiers and caravans.  But the biggest obstacle to his plans is the real power behind the throne ---- Capitan Estaban Pasquale, wonderfully portrayed by Basil Rathbone.  This is real conflict in this movie.On one side we have Don Diego; cuffs of lace, snuff box in hand, and eternally fatigued. He enters a room, Sorry I'm late, but they heated the water for my bath too early.  It was postively tepid! By the time more was carried and properly scented (sigh)..... Life can be trying....don't you think?  He postures and prances, forever exhibiting, to anyone who'll watch, some slight of hand.  It's all the rage at Court, ... oh how I'll miss the scented breezes of Spain!  But the piercing presence of Capitan Estaban Pasquale is never far off.  Here is Basil Rathbone;  his knife-life figure and his compelling voice steal the show.  As Don Luis observes, My dear Estaban is forever thrusting at this or that, he was a fencing master in Madrid. Aside from his skill with a sword, he is smart.  He grills Don Luis (after one fo Zorro's nocturnal visits); Well, what did he look like, what did he say? When he finds out that Zorro wants Don Luis to retire and to name Vega in his place, Estaban draws his eppe and begins making wicked thrusts and swipes with it as he says, Ah Ha! Now we've got something! This Zorro is a Caballero!  No ordinary brigand would concern himself with Vega! This guy's quick.The final Dueling scene between Don Diego and Estaban is the very best in movies..... compelling and breathtaking.  Estaban, grabbing a blubbering Don Luis, on the verge of quitting, by the collar, So you tried to get gold out of the country, did you?  If you ever again take so much as one peso of mine I'll cut or throat from ear-to-ear!!  He turns on Don Diego, Quiet you poppenjay, I have very little reason for letting you live either!  Soon the duel begins.  As graceful as a ballet, quick and razor-like.Of course good triumphs.  There is much to like about this movie. Linda Darnell is exquisite, if a little too sheltered, and Gale Sondergaard is always good as the bad, evil woman.  The music is terrific, and direction is fast. "},{"Title":"Crackerjack","Date":"5 November 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Romance","Review":" SPOILERS...It's hard to imagine that an unassuming fantasy adventure like this would be made today. There are no pop songs in it. There are no outstanding special effects. The makeup isn't grotesque. It's black and white. And we no longer believe in selfless heroes or in crude villains.This movie owes quite a bit to 1937's Robin Hood, not just in its theme but in particular scenes. Diego visits his true love by climbing onto her balcony. Rathbone is the villain. The good guys disguise themselves as monks. And it's got Montagu Love, only he's on the side of the angels here. The bit about Don Diego Vega acting like a puppy is probably borrowed from The Scarlet Pimpernel. But none of this is bothersome. It's an outstanding classic on its own.Several scenes and bits of business stand out. First of all, we have what is probably the best fencing scene on film, between Power and Rathbone, using sabres. (When we first meet Rathbone's character he is shown executing a perfect slow lunge. The fencing coach was Cavens, who also handled Robin Hood to less effect.)Second, there is a dance between Power and Linda Darnell, who was just a teenager at the time and looks beautiful and vulnerable. The song is a simple folk song in 3/4 -- El Sombrero Blanco. It's not a long dance and it's not gussied up with the Buffalo Philharmonic either, but it's a treat to watch and listen to, a marvelous arrangement. Darnell doesn't have much to do except stand and wave her voluminous skirts from side to side and Power is no Jose Greco, but he assumes the proper hypermasculine position that Spanish dancers still use and does a kind of flamenco style tap dance.The clash between the good guys and the bad guys at the end is a bit of a disappointment, one of those wild melees with lots of clanging swords and a comic figure bumping bad guys over the head with a club.No real acting skills are required of the cast. The characters and their motives are far too simple for that. But Power with his curled Spanish hair and sly mustache looks right and his effete Don Diego is amusing. (The disguise seems to cost him some effort, although he was bisexual.) He has a very funny moment when he asks for Lolita's hand in marriage. He's sitting in an armchair (he's always complaining of fatigue) and has just taken a pinch of snuff. I beg to ask for your niece's hand, he announces slowly in a distracted tone. Everyone waits for him to finish the utterance, but he's on the verge of a sneeze, his mouth open, gazing at the floor with a mixture of boredom and irritation as he waits to see if the sneeze is going to take place. While wearing this goofy expression, he manages to come up with, A refusal would crush me. Then he sits back again (the progress of the sneeze was aborted) and taps his mouth with a lacy handkerchief.The script is ironic and witty. Of course even the suggestion of homosexuality had to be avoided but it's an undercurrent throughout Diego's performance. Lots of talk about fabrics and scents. There's a fascinating exchange between Power and Rathbone, who are competing for the affection of a married lady. Rathbone is puncturing an orange with a small knife, over and over. The Capitan seems to regard that fruit as an enemy, remarks Power. Rathbone looks up glowering and replies, A rival. And at one point, reminded that he is to fight another duel in a few minutes, Power slaps his forehead and exclaims, Santa Maria! It slipped my mind! The photography by Arther Miller is black and white at its most functional. The set design is so delightfully Mexican (there's a cactus or agave in every other scene) that one wishes Los Angeles could turn back the clock.Can I add a slightly less relevant note? This is what I think of as a latent status movie, following the anthropologist Ralph Linton. All of us play many parts or roles in life, but not all at the same time. The status we assume at any given moment is our active status, but we have many latent ones to draw on. A man may be a husband at breakfast, a fireman at work, and a fellow passenger on the subway. In films like this, the hero may be compassionate, clever, courageous, and a master of some craft, but he doesn't reveal this latent status until near the end. Power assumes the active status of fop except when he becomes Zorro. Destry acts the fool until he displays his mastery of guns. Doctor Richard Kimball in The Fugitive is only rarely a doctor. The audience is always let in on the existence of the hero's latent status. It's an effective skeleton for a story. It MUST be, because it's used so often.

While not a Tyrone Power fan, I do love Basil Rathbone (one of the most versatile and underrated actors ever, in my opinion), and I thought I'd give the swashbuckler a try.Throughout the picture I kept having this sense of deja vu. I finally realized it was that so many scenes were almost direct replica's of the Flynn/de Havilland masterpiece Adventures of Robin Hood. Alas, The Mark of Zorro lacks Robin Hood's ideals, charming/witty/inspiring dialogue, pacing, depth of acting ability, terrific score, and just about everything else.Tyrone Power has never struck me as a believable actor in any of his roles. He always seems to be on the surface of the lines rather than being immersed in a character or urged from within. His comic flares work fine in this movie but we never really get a sense of the outrage or the intensity that would fuel an outlaw. Flynn, on the other hand, has numerous scenes written specifically to show both his compassion for the underclass and his contempt for corrupt rulers. The two pictures have eerie similarities, down to the day-for-night shooting of chases on horseback. And Friar Tuck -- or is it Pah-dray Somebody? -- confuses the issue more. Linda Darnell is niece of the al-cal-day, mirroring de Havilland's being the ward of Richard I. Of course, de Havilland wipes the floor with Darnell, partly because she's given fantastic scenes with wide scope for character development and partly because she's by far the better actress.The two memorable aspects of this picture for me are the duel between Power & Rathbone and -- oddly enough -- the performance of the Zorro stunt double riding his black horse through the town. The swordplay is everything everyone says it is -- a wonderful example of the art. Power was a trained fencer and it shows! (He clearly wasn't a trained dancer, which also shows.) The intensity and speed of the swordplay is beautiful to watch. As for the stuntee, I found myself mesmerized by the ease with which (presumably) he handled the horse, making quick, light turns and looking for all the world like a centaur. Wonderful horsemanship (I suppose the horse should get some kudos, too!). Some of the best I've seen on film.I really wanted this picture to be better than it was. It had lovely costumes and some nice photography but is no match for the stirring epic that it so clearly seems to be imitating. "}]
