Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film takes place in Afghanistan in the latter days of the Taliban regime, when women were not merely viewed as second class citizens, but were denied any form of education or civil rights and even had to go out in public covered from head to toe to prevent men from seeing their faces.  The filmmaker takes us to the heart of this alien and frightening world and makes us see, perhaps for the first time on the big screen, just how horrific life was for women in that time and place.`Kandahar' is less a narrative film than a series of fascinating vignettes that drive home the realities of life in that part of the world.  What plot there is involves the efforts of a female Canadian journalist to sneak back into her native country to prevent her desperate sister in Kandahar from committing suicide at the next solar eclipse.  But that is really just a string on which to hang the individual pearls that make up the film.  What is of primary interest to both the filmmaker and the audience are the various people the journalist encounters and the many experiences she undergoes.  Hidden beneath her own burka, she witnesses firsthand the devastating poverty, the utter degradation and de-humanization of women, and the authoritarian oppression that defined life in that country during the Taliban rule.  Along the way, she meets an American doctor who is trying his hardest to in some way relieve the misery of these people, but who finds himself waging a losing battle against the primitivism and theocratic oppression that have made life a living hell for the common citizenry of the country.  She also encounters a seemingly endless group of people who have become dismembered by all the land mines left over from the Afghani war with the Russians.  There is one remarkable scene wherein hordes of desperate, one-legged men hobble on crutches across the desert as Red Cross helicopters rain prosthetic limbs down onto the sands below.  It is merely one among many images from the film that seer themselves into the viewer's memory.  Another is a scene in which a male doctor has to examine his female patients through a hole cut out of a sheet, not even being allowed to talk to the woman directly about her symptoms but having to get his information through a male (or female child) `interpreter.'  Makhmalbaf keeps the ending of the film deliberately ambiguous which might frustrate some viewers but which actually adds to the verisimilitude of the piece.  In the same way, much of the acting in the film borders on the amateurish at times, but again that contributes to the pseudo-documentary aura that the film must have to be truly effective.  A clear-cut narrative resolution and slick performances by obviously professional actors would likely rob the film of its much-needed sense of immediacy.`Kandahar,' by providing a voice to so many voiceless people, is a film that cries out to be seen.

However the images and sounds are haunting and profound. Mahkmalbaf is truly a poet of the cinema.The film does not attempt to make a political analysis of the situation of Afghanistan in 2001, but operates on a more humanistic and emotional level, showing the human consequences, the poverty both material and spiritual of life under the Taliban and the indifference of the outside world.The doctor character, far from being implausible, is played by a real person with a very similar history. He is also a stand-in within the film for Makhmalbaf himself, who started as an Islamic fundamentalist revolutionary but has moved towards a more open-minded humanism.The film itself describes a circle, the first scene is also the last, the sun shining through a burqa onto a woman's face. Between are unforgettable images, and a transit across a surreal and nightmarish landscape. Surrender yourself and you will really feel you have been on a journey.The UK DVD also includes The Afghan Alphabet a similarly fictionalised documentary on the struggle to bring education to the three million or so Afghan refugees in Iran.

We make criticise, say, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan for forcing women to wear the burka; but our own society enforces different standards with regard to the male and female exposure of the chest.  We might therefore say that the burka is oppressive not so much in itself but rather as part of a system that undermines the freedom of women; but this is to assume that in our sexist, and over-sexualised, society, women are in practice freer.  In fact, I believe they are; but at some level it is important to acknowledge the arbitrariness of such positions at the deepest level; that they depend on prejudice (to use that word non-prejudicially), on values rather than reason.  To argue that because we know nothing for certain we should therefore do nothing, think nothing is a doctrine of futile despair; but to be aware of the limitations of our own thinking, to know that for certain future generations will surely condemn us are clearly as we condemn others, is vital before we consider the values of societies other than our own, a secular equivalent of humility before God.This is not to say I would like to see a film defending the appalling Taliban.  But even the most tyrannical regime is in some regards the product of the society it tyrannises we are all both prisoners and guards.  To understand that regime (and its true horrors), one needs to understand how it worked with, as well as against, the grain of traditional society; and what is good, as well as what is bad, about that. Unfortunately, this is not what we get with 'Kandahar'.It's a shame, because this film contains the potential material for exploring the ambiguity of life.  Its central character is rude, arrogant and ambitious (a journalist travelling to Afghanistan to try and save her sister, she doesn't hesitate to try to try and make a story out of her ordeal at the same time).  A returning exile, she might be considered as both having the right to criticise what is happening to her country and also the eyes of one who has seen enough to know what is wrong.  But one could just as easily say that she has neither that in fact she has the rights to neither position.  There is thus the  potential to portray her with great ambivalence; but 'Kandahar' prefers the values of propaganda.  So instead she is our witness, our seer and our reliable narrator; and the film is all the weaker for it.'Kandahar' contains some great footage of a bleak but beautiful country, but at times its limited budget shows.  The dialgoue is strange, the second most important character is (bizarrely) an American, and a number of the scenes sit uneasily between documentary and fiction Michael Winterbottom did something similar in 'In This World', but that film was more convincing, because the agenda of the director was less clumsily imposed on every scene.  'Kandahar' has neither documentary truth or dramatic ambiguity; and seems to view the world with a very Western slant.  Perhaps evil is like Schroedinger's cat something that can be labelled or shown, but not both at the same time.  'Kandahar' prefers to label; but I prefer more subtlety in my films.

The pacing, which may seem tedious to folks used to fast action, allows a lyrical visual beauty to arise where another filmmaker may have shown chaos. In turn, this lyrical beauty creates a stillness where compassion begins and grows. What was distant & abstract becomes close & personal. We're shown a perspective on war that is at once starkly simple and deeply caring. I also enjoyed the taste of Persian culture. The legacy of Hafiz, Rumi & other great Persian poets flavors the vivid poetics of Makhmalbaf's cinematography, dialog, and plot structure. Quite a taut alternative to our American viewpoint.

However, Nafas's odyssey is really little more than a device to lift the veil on the poverty and hardship of life in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.Through a series of vignettes, the movie succeeds beautifully in revealing insights that are both fascinating and harrowing.   It is almost impossible to imagine a culture so far removed from the relatively comfortable life enjoyed by more &#145;civilised' nations.  Young boys rock back and forth, reciting the Koran while learning to become Mullahs, pausing only to recite the meaning and purpose of the sabre and semi-automatic machine gun when prompted by their teacher; young girls have lessons in how to resist the temptation to pick up possibly booby-trapped dolls; a doctor treats his female patient by speaking to them via children as they sit either side of a makeshift screen, and conducts his examinations through a small hole in the screen; the threat and consequences of land-mines pervade everybody's life, and year-long waits for prosthetic legs are commonplace, so that prosthetics become a black-market currency.True, the acting is poor &#150; most of the cast are non-professionals, many never even having seen a moving picture before appearing in this film &#150; but, the purpose of this movie was not to dazzle us with superior acting; it was to open an eye to the hardship endured by both men and women in an oppressive regime, and, at this, it succeeds beautifully.

When she receives a letter from her sister in Kandahar saying that she intends to kill herself at the next eclipse, Nafas sets out to enter Afghanistan and find her sister in order to rescue her. Joining a family traveling across the desert she quickly remembers why she fled the country in the first place as her status as a woman is as dangerous as the unseen landmines as she tries to find her sister before time runs out.I knew little about this film prior to watching it apart from that it was popular mostly due to its unfortunate relevance. Watching it from the start to the end I must admit that, as a film or a story it was not as good as some viewers have said. The narrative is simplistic and seems to alter the passing of time to suit itself, while major holes in plotting are rather annoying if that is what you are focusing on. The film also struggles in terms of characters, with Nafas being rather bland and hard to care for, her sister being unseen and not in any more danger than those we do see (ie minimising our passion for the quest) and even the noble Talib Sahid came across as rather an unlikely character to stumble upon.However, I still consider this to be a film worth seeing even after all that. Why? Well, simply because of the view it gives us of Afghanistan &#150; a view that not even the British media did a good job of giving us when the conflict started. I watched this thinking 'this is the country we have been bombing for several years now?' and, while I knew it was hardly the most technologically advanced country, it doesn't really hit home until you see it and, with US news coverage of this side of the country being limited to hyped-up soldiers then this film should be seen to help balance it all out. So Nafas' journey is little more than an excuse to show many aspects of the country within a sort of story and, as that, it is worth seeing &#150; it is hard not to feel for the people as you see the treatment of women, the poor facilities, the horrors of landmines and so on.True to the weakness of the plot, the ending just sort of 'happens' and those who had been holding to the hope of the vague narrative becoming stronger will also be let down. This is not a film to come to for a story or a strong plot because in these areas it is pretty weak and not very good as a film as you'd expect one to be. However it provides insight into a country that we have all heard a lot about over the past few years and, for that and that alone, it is valuable and worth seeing if you can get the chance.

The image as a language is more powerful than words can ever convey. He uses real people rather than actors to enhance authenticity. Afghani-Canadian, Nafas, has three days to save her despairing sister from suicide in Kandahar, in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, but can't enter it normally because of her journalist credentials. Her only choice is to trek from the Iranian border. Mohsen uses this narrative to capture the horrendous ravages and severe plights of a war-torn country steeped in an oppressive culture for women and shackled by the terrifying ideology of the Taliban. He employs no special effects, no physical violence, no explosions, not a single gunshot, not a single drop of blood - just images of everyday life.Nafas can't travel as an unaccompanied woman and she must wear the head to toe burqa covering. For us the burqa is a symbol of the woman's oppression, to the Afghani male it's his honor. Women are meant to be largely invisible, so poignantly captured in family photo portraits. A doctor can only examine his female patient through a small hole in a curtain separating the two and communicate indirectly via a third party such as an accompanying child. Girls are removed from schools en masse. For a woman living under full cover hope is for a day she'll be seen.The austere landscape reinforces the grinding poverty and the meager means of existence, inevitably giving rise to lawlessness and a survival instinct that grabs every opportunity for financial gain. And there is little chance of escaping this hopelessness as the only aspiration for a boy is to be a mullah, a religious figure, through meaningless rote memorization of the Koran evidenced by repetitions of a mantra venerating the only technology allowed &#x96; the AK47 rifle.The most chilling indictment of the war is the hordes of people with missing limbs blown up by land mines which litter the entire country. The most important currency for these people is the prosthetic limb for which they are entitled only one per year. Everyone, including the able-bodied, needs a pair, just in case. The surrealism of a horde of guys racing on crutches to receive crude prosthetic limbs parachuting down from the sky sears the mind.The large bridal party adorned in their fluttering multi-colored burqas (supposedly covering only women) trudging across the barren landscape in rhythm to a numbing chant and tribal drumbeat heading towards a wedding in Kandahar conveys a notion of traditional bliss and innocence. That vanishes like a mirage when the party is intercepted at a Taliban checkpoint. The curious presence of an African American looking for God, but ends up as a doctor administering whatever relief he can to basic health issues, is a statement that the core problem in Afghanistan is not religion per se but a dysfunctional country in a state of crippling deprivation of everything.This movie was released in 2001, a decade after Taliban forces, aided and abetted by the United Sates, defeated the might of the then Soviet Union in their misguided and disastrous attempt to invade Afghanistan. This left the shattered country at the mercy of the extremist ideologically driven Taliban. The United States' response to 9/11 was to invoke a war against terror targeting the same Taliban forces. More bombs and military destruction followed. The country has once again been plunged into unimaginably crippling devastation.The overarching message of this movie is the carnage and utter futility of war in bringing about desired social outcomes. It would appear Americans have neither learned the lessons of the Vietnam War nor from the Soviet's recent experience. Bombs and other military hardware are useless against an enemy with neither significant infrastructure nor targets to be destroyed. Deploying highly equipped alien boots on the ground is not going to win the hearts and minds of a population devoid of the means of livelihood, scarred by decades of war and lacking the education to escape this quagmire. The entire country becomes an even more fertile ground for breeding and recruiting terrorists &#x96; the antithesis of the war's objective. The American effort in Afghanistan is reputed to cost $1 billion each day. Imagine this amount redirected into developing and educating the country instead.Makhmalbaf makes a pointed reference to the total uselessness of the UN. Its flag, being a symbol of neutrality that was meant to protect the traveling party, ended up planted next to a human skeleton in the desert. The only thing of tokenistic value recovered from the skeleton was a bejeweled ring, which ended up being worthless.

Brush that aside. No, why this should be illuminating is because it swoops down in a strange corner of the world and finds intimacy and truth among the absurdity. Not for any contrasts the filmmaker can whisper to us but for those the place can whisper to his camera. This is what Chris Marker did again and again, who is the inspiration behind this; the eye reflected back. This too what Herzog did, who chases after absurdities because the landscape close to them tilts revelations.Absurdities abound along the way here; a makeshift hospital where amputees clamor to be fitted with crude artificial legs, the legs dropped from the sky. The rosy afterglow of flat desert is an evocative canvas, the veiled women chill like they always do with that sense of wasted beauty. But so little here feels stumbled on to, discovered, open; it feels stagy and contrived. A quick look at the background of the film reveals that it was shot, a little more safely perhaps, on this side of the Iranian border. The faces, the dresses, the landscape, all these are probably not much different than over there, but there's also no urgency anymore. I won't pretend to know better than the filmmaker of course but the whole film strikes me as more about culture than reflection, the kind of culture about faraway, oppressed places patrons love to consume at film festivals in Europe.Maybe it's his way of saying there are no more vital truths than the absurdity that people contrive to create that has a male doctor examining an Afghan female patient through a hole so as to not see her face.

She travels to Iran, and then to Afghanistan, to help her sister. (Her sister is terribly depressed, and plans to commit suicide within a few days.) There's a very grim scene in Iran, when children returning to Afghanistan are taught to avoid picking up dolls, because they may be booby-trapped with explosives. Then Nafas crosses into Afghanistan with a group of returning refugees.The remainder of the movie--set in Afghanistan--makes the situation in Iran look idyllic. All the women wear the burqa (burka), so that we can't see them, and they have to see the world through a semi-transparent veil. Lawlessness abounds. Gunmen--I assume they are Taliban--roam the area and operate at will. Most horribly, people with amputated limbs are everywhere. There's a whole culture of amputations and artificial limbs, with more amputations from land mines every day.Nafas makes her way though this dangerous landscape in what is, in essence, a road movie. Although the people she meets are interesting--and sometimes generous and helpful--the situation is so depressing that it's hard to find any comfort while watching the film.This movie gives us a snapshot of what it would be like to be a woman--accustomed to living in North American--who has returned to a very different homeland from the one she left.

"},{"Title":"Kandahar, addresses both the plight of Afghan women under the Taliban and the accumulated misery of the Afghan people.","Date":"26 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":" Kandahar or Safar e Ghandehar is a film that tells about a journey towards Kandahar, the second largest city of Afghanistan, undertaken by Nafas, a young female journalist who escaped Afghanistan with her family but must return and race against time in an attempt to rescue her sister. Nafas, an Afghani refugee who fled to Canada when the Taliban came to power, receives word in 1999 that her sister will commit suicide at the last solar eclipse of the millennium due to unbearable conditions under the Taliban, both as a woman and as a casualty of a landmine. As the film proceeds, Nafas learns more and more about the hardships women face under the Taliban, and even more so, how years of war have destroyed Afghan society. The film is inspired by the real-life experience of actress Nelofer Pazira, who plays Nafas. In 1989, she fled her homeland of Afghanistan and later received a similar letter not from a sister, but from a long-time friend who wanted to end her life in a similar situation starting her trek from the Iran-Afghanistan border, Nafas disguises herself as the fourth wife of an elderly Afghan man. As Nafas' desperation grows (she has only three days to reach Kandahar before her sister kills herself, on the day of the last solar eclipse of the century), the images grow more and more dreamlike. At one point, Nafas encounters a madrasah, where boys with AK47 rifles intone verses from their holy book as a bearded mullah looks on. Later, with the help of an English-speaking African American doctor, she wanders into a Red Cross relief center for mine victims. Nafas's guide, hidden behind a false beard, points out to her that the only technological progress allowed in the country is weaponry. One healthy man named Sahid continually begs the nurses to let him have a set of legs for his mother -- legs he will no doubt sell on the black market. The doctor guide persuades Sahid, who finally gets a pair of artificial legs, to accompany Nafas in her journey, until they run into a wedding party traveling into Kandahar. Nafas attempts to fit in with the party, but the end of the road is unfortunately near for her. Dressed in burkas, the pair joins a wedding party which is stopped by the Taliban because they are playing musical instruments and singing--forbidden by Afghan law. Her guide is taken away and she is unveiled.Makhmalbaf ominously concludes by showing us Nafas' point of view as she lowers her burkha,literally and powerfully drawing a veil over her fate. Captured, she seems destined to fall into the same kind of life that she hoped to help her sister escape. Interestingly the film begins and ends with that brilliant shot of lowering of the burkha by Nafas, perhaps reminding us of the famous couplet And the end of all our exploringWill be to arrive where we started. This shot of the movie, a solar eclipse as seen through the burka's mesh and its blinding effects seem to have irradiated the heroine into a kind of waking stupor. Nafas' journey is long and rambling and may have only taken place in her head. But, as the movie's director Mohsen Makhmalbaf implicitly asks in every scene, what is Afghanistan but a state of mind?It is filmed documentary-style, but the plot is heavily scripted. Also, the English-language dialogue suffers from flat delivery. The protagonist seems phony; every potentially poignant moment is ruined by her deadpan method of speaking. Visually, the film is stunning at times, especially when one sees the wedding party march in the desert. The sea of burqas in contrasting colors (such as emerald, black, ochre yellow, peach, white, purple, etc.) is absolutely stunning. There's even surrealism when prosthetic legs for land mine victims at a Red Cross camp parachute to the groundBut the quality of the cinematography is not enough to rescue the flawed direction. The vast open spaces also allow Makhmalbaf and his outstanding cinematographer, Ebrahim Ghafouri, to create a steady flow of stunning images, accompanied by Mohammad Reza Darvishi's intoxicating yet spare score. . . The plot is not very thoroughly developed. The scenery is beautiful, in a stark way, and the plot is barely enough to keep a viewer dramatically involved, but the point is to learn about life in today's Afghanistan.The Taliban is gone, but the socio-cultural matrix which gave rise to its existence still flourishes in Afghanistan. It will take a lot more than a few years to heal that wounded countryWriting in The New York Times,A.O.Scott noted that both Kandahar and Abbas Kiarostami's ABC Africa(about Ugandan orphans) contain moment of sublime visual poetry that at once heighten and complicate their humanitarian message. Even though it deals directly with neither war nor terrorist violence, it is an anti war movie with a difference.

There were, however, three excellent images from this film.  The first was the throng of burqua covered travelers heading toward the wedding.  The second was the surreal parachuting prosthetic legs and the third was the series of family portraits taken of refugees before they returned home.I was disappointed that this was such a western feeling film.  It shocks me that the heroine was interested not in preserving her homeland or even restoring it.  Her goal was merely to save her friend and leave.  She did so by flashing wads of US dollars and expecting the locals to jump at the chance to get money.  She even expected the refugee father to stick with her and protect her instead of his family because she had paid him.  None of the indigenous people had any agency at all, and there was no remorse demonstrated about this truth.In the film-maker's defense, I cannot imagine any distribution contract coming for a movie which does the things I am seeking, but that was my hope nevertheless.If you see it, see it for the occasional stirring image, but don't expect plot, dialog or character development.

Some cultures are so far removed from what we have been brought up to believe in that is is almost impossible to connect with in any shape or form.I have always believed that each culture should be looked at on its own merits and the Western Christian/Judeao civilisation is not necessarily the answer to it all. But how can anybody find any merit in a society run by someone like the Taliban. Everybody is opressed,   the women more than any, but everybody lives a miserable life. There is no compassion, no respect for divergent views. The poverty is so all pervading that survival at the most basic level is all that matters.The film is not really a coherent narrative, more a series of vignettes  showing what life was like under the Taliban. Despite the amateur acting it is a powerful film. A number of powerful images, the most powerful, to me, is the scene depicting how female patients are dealt with by a doctor. Horrifying.

What is great is Ebraham Ghafouri's magnificent cinematography.  A shot of artificial legs dropping from the sky by parachute, with peasants running on crutches to retrieve them, is the most profound I have seen this year.  The opening aerial shot of the dense mountains juxtaposed with the white desert and colorful burka veils is another immensely pleasing visual.Unsettling for a Westerner would have to be the pervasive poverty, misogyny, and land mines.  And this film is before 9/11. Emphasizing the need for change in a seemingly changeless culture, one character says, For women, hope is the day she will be seen.' The film allows us to hope for that change. When one character says, Weapons are the only modern thing in Afghanistan, the savagery of lost limbs and starving children is underscored and unforgettable.To enter Kandahar, women and men hide under veils with often harrowing results. The director sends light through holes in the burka, a wholly new way to use point of view and to symbolize imprisoned women.

The second is, I don't think the central figure had enough charisma......Although thinking about it now, the two may have counterbalanced themselves quite well.... Anyway, it was interesting...so to was the documentary on the DVD, called Afghan alphabet. My concern about politics is illustrated nicely on that, when a young Afghan refugee, is used to show the oppression of the Taliban, because she is scared to remove her Bhurka for fear of sinning.....She is asked repeatedly what her name was, which she repeatedly said she didn't want to divulge and was clearly uncomfortable, and was in my opinion mentally bullied into removing her bhurka, which makes you wonder who is doing the oppressing now!!!

The fact that Kandahar was even made is so much more important than the quality of the narrative or the development of the characters (much of the dialogue is improvised and is delivered in a stiff monotone by amateur actors). The film was shot on the Iranian-Afghan border (the Taliban, who were then in power, refused to allow filming in Afghanistan). Conditions were primitive. Makhmalbaf and his crew received constant threats and had to wear a disguise every day to survive. Yet, Kandahar succeeds in illuminating the extreme poverty and hunger in Afghanistan, the conditions of women who must hide their identity behind their burqas (veils), and the constant, daily threat of landmines left over from the Russian-Afghani War. Nafas (Niloufar Pazira), an Afghan refugee in Canada, receives a letter from her sister in Afghanistan informing her that she intends to commit suicide on the approaching eclipse of the sun. In a desperate bid to save her, Nafas decides to travel back to the city of Kandahar. The guides who accompany Nafas include an old man steeped in traditional tribal mores; a young boy who faces starvation when he's expelled from his religious school; a black American who went to Afghanistan to find God but failed; and a landmine victim. In a powerful scene, Nafas stumbles on a medical camp where Afghan men beg for prosthetic legs (Makhmalbaf cast actual limbless victims to fill these roles). Apparently, these patients wait for almost a year to receive primitive, metal limbs. Accompanied by Mohamad Reza Darvishi's haunting score, cinematographer, Ebraham Ghafouri creates memorable images men hobbling on their crutches to retrieve prosthetic limbs being parachuted down from the sky, and a man draping his wife's dress over a pair of prosthetic legs to ensure that she gets the right fit. Though flawed, Makhmalbaf's film is a moving depiction of the desperate conditions in Afghanistan, one that should be seen in the Western world, now that many think all the problems in that area have been resolved. In a recent interview, Ms. Pazira said that she believes it's the awareness of the rest of the world that could bring change. I am an optimist in that sense, she says. With Kandahar, we tried our best -- we set up a little movie theatre in the village, we started a school for women and we introduced them to a world they'd never seen before. That could be a crack in the wall. Much more could be done practically, but I can't simply do it. We've done our little share of responsibility. Now I want people to take this message away and think about it.If more people would think about it, the crack in the wall could become a lot wider.

Until then, most Americans didn't care about the vicious and ruthless nature of those who governed that country.Former President Bill Clinton said his one regret during his presidency was that he did nothing while nearly one million people were slaughtered in Rwanda. True. But he should also consider why the U.S., this beacon of democracy, did nothing while the Taliban mistreated women and massacred Afghanis. Even George W. Bush gave the Taliban nary a thought until that horrific day in 2001.When it was initially released, Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film, Kandahar, probably had little chance of finding an audience in the U.S. After all, at the time, the majority of Americans wouldn't have been able to find Afghanistan on a map, let alone know where Kandahar was. But then Sept. 11 happened and Kandahar, like Kabul and Spin Boldak, became household words in American homes. U.S. TV networks rushed out experts on Afghanistan and reported on the Taliban's brutality as if they'd uncovered a previously unknown fact.Of course, all that's changed now. We don't care about Afghanistan anymore. Not after this administration concocted evidence and launched an unjust war against Iraq, gaining support for it by frightening Americans. Paranoia is patriotic. Also, covering the downfall of a barbaric regime that didn't put up a fight isn't as sexy as giving round-the-clock coverage on a pop star accused of child molestation or a yet another rich, young, white woman gone missing in California. Watching Kandahar, you'll no doubt wonder why we didn't intervene years ago. If this film doesn't make Americans truly appreciate their lives and rights, which they take for granted, nothing will.The film's inspired by true events. Writer and star Nelofer Pazira, who fled Kabul with her family, tried to enter Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to search for her best friend who stayed behind. Pazira never got beyond the Iranian-Afghan border. But filmmaker Makhmalbaf, whom Pazira had contacted earlier, decided two years later to fictionalize Pazira's story.I admit I was in two minds after watching Kandahar. The acting's amateurish - they're all non-actors - and the storytelling is, at times, a bit heavy-handed. I don't know whether it was a good idea to cast Pazira. Her character carries the entire film and it needs someone who can pulls us into her plight. Pazira's narration occasionally gets ponderous. The film relies heavily on that narration to serve as exposition; a good example of tell don't show, when films should be otherwise. Pazira never varies her voice and her monotone can be off-putting. A stronger actress could have done wonders with the role.However, these flaws could be ignored because of what the film's trying to tell us. Maybe we're too spoiled by professional-looking Hollywood films to appreciate something like this. The film's beautifully shot and contains several wrenching moments. I shan't spoil it for you, but there's an unforgettably potent moment in a Red Cross camp.Kandahar makes a good double feature with Siddiq Barmak's Osama (2003). Also, do yourself a great favor - read Khaled Hosseini's powerful novel, The Kite Runner, a film adaptation of which will be directed by Sam Mendes.Kandahar proves great nations should help oppressed people even if the assistance doesn't fall into the narrow category of national interest. That would be an acceptable reason than scaring an uninformed populace with fake evidence about nonexistent WMDs. Kandahar might not look polished, the acting not brilliant. But I'll take this film any day over huge, glossy Hollywood clunkers - Be Cool and Hostage, for instance - showing in theaters right now.

The expectation seems to have been that it would be some kind of stark politically motivated condemnation that would have fitted in nicely with the war-rhetoric of late 2001 - early 2002. The film is not that simplistic. Neither is it quite the documentary people may have expected either. Now that I've seen a couple more of Makhmalbafs films I can finally tune into this movie and get rid of the baggage, and the passing of time since the bombing of Afghanistan helps too. This film is more concerned with humanity than politics, and is not out to condemn anyone (which some westerners may have been expecting in abundance). I don't mean that the Taliban are made out as good guys, anything but. The film just isn't propaganda, that's all. And Makhbalmaf's style is closer to Tarkovsky than documentary. Infact the movie could hardly even be called 'semi-documentary,' just because of the subject matter.However, some of the criticisms of the film are valid  a few technical problems with the sound in the opening scene (which really does throw the audience from the begining, and it takes a while to get back into the movie) and the lead actress is extremly wooden, at least when acting in english (Maybe there's an Arabic & Farsi version that's more convincing...).The golden rule with this movie is don't expect from it something which it is not going to deliver, and you'll be able to appreciate it.

It's no easy way for her to walk alone to Kandahar. She has to undercover herself to reach Kandahar. But Kandahar story is more than Nafas' story.

They looked like a troupe of children dressed as ghosts for Halloween. Except this set of ghosts were dressed in stunning blues and golds and light-swallowing black. The women, essentially, are invisible. They are not people anymore.While this movie may not have the smooth production values or level of acting that we're used to in the West, it makes up for these lackings by the strength of its message. Images from the movie continue to haunt me a week later -- the before-mentioned burquas, the sorrowful blue eyes of our narrator, the doctor speaking to his patients through a blanket, the women sneaking some lipstick or other makeup under their burquas.Excellent.

I needed some outside coaching with respect to the enjoying of reality cinema, which this movie is about. This helped me turn my utter irritation into some thinking.The movie tells a tale and tries to inform. Other people have already described the content in details. For me, the movie is about the daily experiences of detached and traumatized people that face life with vigor and enduring optimism. I like the director Makhmalbaf, he's an honest and sincere guy. The movie images were beautiful, with a creepy scene of the slowmotion one-legged group (and the thump of a fallen monoped)reaching for the drifting legs, as one of the most impressive. Also, the teaching of girls (explosive dolls) and boys (rocking the holy scripture) were strangely realistic scenes with enough art in it to stay fascinated.The acting is extremely bad in some places (Oh, but you don't understánd, I háve to see my sister who is in Kándahar). I know the female star came up with the action/story but don't let her play the role, what is better ban her from the screen!!!! The cyclic solar eclipse scene is an example of adding some poetry to the reality images, which is fine in retrospective. At the actual momement I feared the worst for the coming 80 minutes. Still, let Makhmalbaf inform more people (not only the Bush administration) and tell another story - i'm all the more curious. In the future, actors could be found in non-refugee surroundings too.

The movie begins with the unveiled woman entering Afghanistan on a Red Cross helicopter, and ends with the same woman covered by a burqa in front of Kandahar. In between, we see the character going through a process of re-afghanization, led by a handful of well depicted, strange characters a tagiki man who migrates back and forth between Afghanistan and Iran with his wives and children, a smart boy with an inclination for business, an American black man turned afghani village doctor, a burlglar without a harm. More, the themes of hunger and poverty, woman exploitation, totalitarian (yet chaotic) regime and, above all, mines, pervade the whole movie.Some shots remind of Italian neorealism, others of Fellinian surrealism, but always with a very Iranian constraint and dignity. Wonderful scenes are the parachuting of the artificial legs for the people maimed by afghans and the throng of women (and men!) in their colored burqas heading to Kandahar for a wedding party, some of them really just trying to escape the country. Unlike European or American cinema, a very real sense of tragedy and violence is achieved without use of special effects, explosions, cries of pain. Also, the movie is wonderfully shot. The woman's journey is both a journey to the underground (like Ulysses' in the Odissey) and a search for essential humanity in an essential environment, the object of the quest being impersonated by the maimed sister, hence completely nonabstract.This is a great movie, that, by a tragic coincidence, is being released in our (Italian) cinemas while Kandahar is being bombed. It seems that only Iranian film directors are able, nowadays, to make great cinema.Nicola "},{"Title":"Kiss the ground","Date":"16 January 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, War","Review":"  Greetings again from the darkness.

I was hoping to see a real documentary about a difficult travel to the infamous city of Kandahar. I found it confusing to find out that this is a documentary-styled non-fiction movie. Anyhow, the movie certainly gives a chilling look inside the daily lives in Afghanistan, a country torn apart by war and hunger. The desperate journey of a woman to save her sister out of Kandahar shows us the attitude of the Afghani's and the bizarre difficulties that a woman in Afghanistan faces. I believe the movie was shot in Iran and the characters - refugees, desert tribesman and war-victims with amputated feet or hands -, had not only never appeared in front of the camera before but did not even know what film was prior to the arrival of the production team. Before shooting could take place the actors were shown videos to familiarise them with the media of the moving image. Now this is what causes the weakness of the movie. The english speaking characters did not convince me with their acting. They look uncertain and don't seem to have any movie experiences. (Except for the afro-american doctor, he convinced me). Even the Afghani characters speaking -to me unfamiliar- languages gave me the feeling they were reading from an auto-queue rather than acting spontanious. Also the chronological order in this movie was confusing, sometimes even not correct. All this leaves a bad impression behind on me. Even though most comments i've read are very positive - even if it's filmed in a far away county, by an Iranian director - I believe good actors make the movie.

Far less didactic than another recent Iranian film that grimly looked at women's lives under fanatic Islam, The Circle, Kandahar was inspired by a Canadian-Afghani journalist's real quest and somewhat improvised around the people she and the director met on the Afghan-Iranian border while shooting the film, and utilized as amateur actors (including one now identified as a Khomeini-directed assassin).The images are simply stunning and unforgettable (such that the noisy popcorn eaters stopped crunching bags mid-handful)-- prosthetic limbs parachuted into desert Red Cross stations chased by amputees on crutches, posed family portraits with the plural wives covered in burkhas, a mullah martinet leading a crowded class of a madrassas in rote memorization of both the Koran and the use of weapons, and women covered in multi-colored burkhas sweeping over the desert to a frightening check-point.But all are shown as complex, surprising characters -- the amputees are victims of land mines set up by many different sources over the decades or maybe, in a region filled with crafty con men and survival thieves, are victims of rough justice; the mullah is feeding the starving boys; and the husband defends the use of the burkha as a traditional point of honor. Of course even little touches mean more now -- we understand the look of fearful unease as one man mutters that he can't go to Kandahar because he's been in the prison there. It's not just the women who lead lives of quiet desperation in war-torn Afghanistan.There's no conventional ending, only our imaginations, but then who knows wither Afghanistan?

The subject matter is certainly intriguing, as well as the promise of a semi-documentary, semi-fictional story. However Return to Kandahar is simply a bad example of either genre. This film is simply poorly made and I would caution all to avoid it like a landmine. However if you wish to see it, I will prepare you for what awaits. Terrible actors delivering stilted dialogue repeating arbitrary information ad naseum, a set up that is repeatedly brought up throughout the movie and never delivered upon, and random subtitles, some of which are literally on for less than a 10th of a second. Not because some movies have subtitles that just go too fast for a person to read, but clearly because of sloppy editing that was never cleaned up.It is the setting of this film that people must be raving about. If the same film maker had told a similar story in Canada, about a woman traveling from Toronto to Prince Rupert, and used the same terrible film making, it would not have even made it to the bottom shelf of a 99 cent video store. It's 2001, Afghanistan, where any credibility for this film exists.

The upper class star/maker of the film seemed part of the problem rather than part of any solution. She seemed quite unaware of this.

This movie really opened my eyes to a whole other world.  I knew there were troubles in the world and that women did not get as much freedom in many other countries as they do in the United States, but the societies depicted in KANDAHAR look and feel like something out of one of those post-apocalyptic science fiction movies like PLANET OF THE APES or MAD MAX. Its sad that people have to live like this.Many of the film's key scenes and images are haunting, important, and unforgettable.  The doctor talking indirectly to his patient behind a sheet through a third party.  The dozens of children reciting and memorizing the Koran without any clue what they are saying and why.  And of course, the most unforgettable image of the film the dozens of limbless Afghans racing to pick up a pair of legs that just dropped out of an airplane and is parachuting to the ground.P.S.

This film is regarded with praise as it holds awards, however, comparing Kandahar to American films, it stands as absolutely nothing special in the opinions of Americans, and in the opinion of my own. Kandahar is slow, repetitive, and holds no sentimental meaning. With the tension that is held between the United States and the Middle East, this film does not help the feud.Usually in stories, not just films, but in literature period, you have 7 structures to a good plot. There is the Leading character, an inciting incident that throws the main character out of balance, a objective for the character, obstacles in the characters way, a crisis which is the toughest obstacle for the character, a climax were the story is at its highest point, and a resolution where the action falls and the story is left at an end or at interpretation. All of these elements are essential for telling a story, now let's look at Kandahar. We are introduced to the leading female character as we learn she is thrown off balance by her sister who needs help, her objective which is to find and save her sister, obstacles where she has to travel though a dangerous dessert flooding with thieves. This is where the film ends, that is all this movie has to offer. Did she find her sister? We don't know many Arab films have open endings because they believe that life is a journey and should always be left open. In my opinion that is absurd and stories of that genre are rubbish. As far as I know every journey I've ever been through has an end, but life can still continue even if a journey such as High School or a show production ends. I cannot decipher why these filmmakers would do this. I just wasted and hour of a half of my life that i will never get back in watching half of a movie. That is like watching Star Wars and the movie is turned off before the X-wings enter the Death Star trench. That is like ending Citizen Kane without showing the audience the Rosebud sled. The film get's the audience into these characters and awaits some kind of crisis that would lead to the climax and resolution, but instead we are left with an unfinished film. Unless if there is a Kandahar 2 (god forbid), this film serves no purpose. The leading characters sister wanted to commit suicide in the film, I don't blame her, I wan contemplating killing myself half way through this film too.I cannot help but express my feeling towards this atrocious film, let alone writing an essay about it. America has made some pretty bad films, but few of them compare the animosity of this example of an Arab film. I'd rather watch Ed Wood films without a companion to tell jokes too. I'd rather watch an edited copy of the Star Wars prequels that only show the scenes with Hayden Christiansen. I'd rather watch the extended directors cut of Dune. I'd rather watch the dance sequence in Spider-man 3 over and over again . If my life were a movie, I'd call up Doctor Emit Brown and borrow his DeLorean so I can drive 88 miles per hour, go back in time, and prevent this film from ever being made. No one on this earth, that includes criminals and terrorists deserve the torture of watching Kandahar, and anyone who shows this film is the meanest and most sadistic individual on the face of this green earth. Watching this film in class made me happier that I have changed my major to theater so I can never run any risk of being forced to watch such a terrible movie ever again. "}]
