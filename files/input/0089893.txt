She has a plum role playing a villainous megalomaniac and she enjoys every minute of it.Paul Smith and his sidekick Ernie Reyes Jr. almost steal the show, quite charming. Again there is a humanity in Smith's character, this loyalty and taking seriously of an oath that rings true for the imagined world of this sword and sorcery entry.Tutte Lemkow's portrayal of a wizard is one of the minor roles that is very well done.Of all the sword and sandal movies I have seen over the years I have a special place for this 1985 film.It is a feel good movie, romantic, exciting, beautiful scenery and costumes and an excellent ARNOLD film.

My sister and I used to watch this movie all the time when we were kids, we both wanted to so badly fight with Red Sonja and be apart of the group. So oddly, after years of not watching this since I was a kid, my sister and I found the DVD for 5 dollars and decided to watch it. Oh, the things that are so wrong with this film that makes it so right again. Looking to be a spin off of Conan, we were introduced to Red Sonja played by Flava-Flav's ultimate true love, Bridgitte Nielson. The 6 foot tall drink of glass shows us that this was her acting class as she rehearses her lines as if she had just read them the night before and screams Gedren, where are you?! while moving her mouth in the strangest way. She teams up with world's other tall drink of &#x85; beef(?) Arnold Schwarzenegger as they battle it out on who can act the worst? Well, who knows who will win with this silly story.A large temple full of white-robed priestesses are getting ready to destroy a large, glowing green orb called the Talisman. This dangerous artifact's destructive power increases from exposure to light and the priestesses intend to destroy it before it gets out of control. However, the evil Queen Gedren and Ikol attack with their army. The warrior-priestesses resist, but are ultimately subdued by Gedren's forces. Gedren gets her hands on the Talisman, but not before proving the myth that only women can touch it and survive. Gedren orders the remaining priestesses to be imprisoned in the vault which held the Talisman. One of those priestesses, Varna, manages to escape. She doesn't get far before she's mortally wounded by an arrow in the back. As luck would have it, she literally falls into the arms of the mighty Lord Kalidor. She begs him to help find her sister, Red Sonja. Sonja has been training with a Chinese sword master when Kalidor informs Sonja about her sister. Sonja arrives just in time for Varna to tell her about what happened at the temple. Before dying, Sonja's sister urges her to find the Talisman and destroy it, or else the world will be destroyed. Everything about this movie is bad, but that's what I love about it. You know how sometimes you just need a bad movie that you can make fun of and have a good time with? Supposedly, Arnold Schwarzenegger jokes that he uses this movie as punishment for his kids when they act up. Is it that bad? It is bad, but it's a ton of fun. I loved the action, Arnold fighting Bridgitte for her love as no man may have her unless he's trying to kill her, lol. I loved the last fight scene between Red Sonja and Queen Gedren, Gedren loves pulling a ton of jump cuts on her as well as one of Gedren's wizards who is using vodoo to cut Sonja to weaken her, then when she discovers the wizard, instead of him cutting her again, he just stands there, lol. Also the little Prince Tarn with Falkon was classic and they worked so well together. I think the scene that made me laugh the most was when Red Sonja, Prince Tarn and Falkon are stuck in the cave with the machine dragon and Arnold is just riding around with it making it look more like a roller coaster ride rather than a fight for his life, lol! My opinion, if a movie entertains you even if it is bad, why fight it? This is a good bad movie and I know I will always enjoy it. My recommendation being if you have an open mind and decide to just let go and enjoy the ride Red Sonja takes you on, take it or leave it.7/10 "},{"Title":"Conan III","Date":"25 March 2010","Score":"8 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" It's been ages since I've seen this film, and it holds about as much interest for me as when I first saw it. It's entertaining on a certain level, and holds some interest.Some minor notes before progressing with my comments; Kalidor in reality is Conan's alternate name. That is to say Conan and Kalidor are one in the same person as per Robert Howard's authorship. Ergo Laurentis casting Arnie in the role was most likely deliberate, though Governor Schwarzenegger and his then agent may have had the wool pulled over their eyes and had this little fact kept from them when approached for the role. In fact and essence you're seeing Conan the Barbarian III, in spite of the Red Sonja title.But, enough of that. Can Bridgette Neilson act? Yeah, sure. Is she Oscar material? Err... no. Was she right for the role? Probably. How about the other roles? Me, I think Sandahl Bergman rejoining the Conan cast as a lesbian queen was a fine choice. And pardon my prurient interest, but I think she's hotter as a brunette with short hair than as a natural blonde )The film is what it is; a thinly veiled knockoff of the first two Conan films, though again, it really IS a third (albeit unofficial) installment of the franchise, so to speak. The sets and art direction for a moderately budgeted sequel are actually fairly impressive, though one gets the sense that there's some slight of hand being used to mask budgetary limitations. And, believe it or not, it works after a fashion. There's the usual we can't afford to costume real life size armies, so we'll allude to armies and battles in dialog, than actually show them thing going on. But there're enough costumed bodies to get the gist across that our antagonist does command vast hosts to conquer the Hyborean world. Other technical aspects; it's not a poorly shot film, but the cinematography doesn't recapture Milius' touch with the first Conan film. But, then again, there is a kind of artistic professionalism that comes across in this movie that can be admired after a fashion. The one thing that strikes me visually, other than the elaborate and well designed costumes and set pieces, is the fact that even though the cinematography is respectable, there's no real theme to it. The shots are fairly static, but well composed, yet there's no underlying dynamic to them. In essence the cast and crew were told to do their best with the material they were given, and they do so in spades.This isn't to say the film is outstanding, because it isn't. But everyone puts their best foot forward in a film that's pretty much all- business. That is to say it was given a nice clean professional coat, but lacked a certain integrity that comes across in the script. We are, in fact and essence, watching Robert Howard's feminized version of Conan do her thing and not much else.What could have improved this film? Lots of things, I suppose. A bigger budget for one to actually stage some large battle sequences as Sandahl's character goes about conquering the world. Neilson does her double-Y chromosome thing as an Arnie imitation, but is perhaps off par by a stroke or two in terms of performance. Arnie does his thing, and Sandahl does hers (she actually gives a respectable performance). Reyes Junior is who he is, and does an adequate job as a spoiled brat.The truth of the matter is that this film was made in the 80s, when female marketed films weren't seen as big money makers, and so it was budgeted as such; i.e. it wasn't expected to make lots of money, but financed to put on a good show. Red Sonja is to the Conan films as Supergirl was to the Superman films. All in all it's another De Laurentis production. Take it for what it is, interesting and entertaining popcorn fare.

The intentional comedy comes from a young prince (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard (Paul Smith).

With nothing else on TV I came across this whilst channel hopping and somehow I decided to give it my time. A good choice as it turns out for though this is a low rated and oft mocked piece of trash, its also lively and fast paced with a fair degree of brainless endearment. The plot has barbarian warrior Red Sonja up against the evil Queen Gedren who not only murdered her family but is also likely to destroy the entire world with an powerful ancient relic in her insatiable quest for power. With help from Arnold Schwarzenegger, an irritating young prince and his noble retainer our barbarian lass sets out to get revenge and save the world. In conventional terms this isn't such a good film. As Sonja, Brigitte Nielsen is pleasingly wooden, though slightly more animated than Arnie's oaken turn. Ernie Reyes Jr. is thoroughly obnoxious and punchable as the young prince, though Paul L. Smith puts in a good performance, likable as the retainer Falkon. To make up for the low key acting from everyone else Sandahl Bergman overacts to good effect as Queen Gedren, but none of them are particularly well served by the script, which isn't quite bad enough for proper camp value but never very good either. Fortunately the film has a sprightly pace and exciting direction from veteran Richard Fleischer, the sword fighting is regular and fairly well choreographed and edited. Ennio Morricone contributes a suitably rousing score and the budget is decent enough to allow for quality art direction and effects that include a cool robot water snake, so the film actually conveys a pretty fun ancient fantasy world with some good locations. Always predictable but never dull there is a lot of fun to be had here for the more forgiving viewer though the film should definitely have aimed higher. It is slightly awkwardly perched, a bit too juvenile and silly for older tastes but slightly too intense for younger children and the sort of thing that most viewers these days will likely scoff at, it is best poised to elicit easy smiles and chuckles from junky fantasy fans. In fact its easy going trashy fun is almost enough to push it up to a 7/10, but Ernie Reyes' character is just so danged annoying I can't bring myself to it. Seriously, that kid deserved a serious seeing to, Red Sonja should have whupped him like she threatened to. Ah well, can't be helped. Altogether then, this is no classic, but I liked it enough and if you go for this kind of silliness you might too.

Colorful cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno , Federico Fellini's usual . Very derivative special effects , grand production design by Danilo Donati ,and matte paintings by Albert Whitlock and Emilio Ruiz del Rio . Impressive musical score composed and conducted by the master Ennio Morricone. The motion picture is middling directed by Richard Fleischer . He's an expert director , with adventure classics (Vikings, 20.000 leagues under sea) and noir cinema (Narrow margin,Clay pigeons,Trapped).

For example, that Queen Gedren was a lesbian who wished to force Red Sonja to be her love slave. It was also quite humorous for Gedren to think that should could actually take on Sonja (who has been given supernatural strength by a goddess) in a sword fight.

Having made a couple of sword 'n' sorcery films (as Conan) he had moved onto slightly more serious acting roles in films like The Terminator and Commando, only to make a mystifying return to the sword 'n' sorcery genre for this 1985 debacle. It's hard to figure out why he bothered, as this is weaker than both Conan films in every conceivable department. Allegedly, this was to have been the third Conan film, but for one reason or another the emphasis was shifted onto the leading female character, the titular red-head, leaving poor old Arnold to play an incredibly dull supporting role. Spare a thought, too, for director Richard Fleischer who had given the world classics like 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea, Fantastic Voyage, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this - his penultimate film - Fleischer also has taken a gigantic career step backwards.Evil queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world, and she needs a priceless and powerful talisman to do so. She and her brutish army storm a keep populated by priestesses and steal the said talisman, massacring the helpless priestesses as they go. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery red-headed warrior, who upon hearing of her sister's death swears revenge upon the evil Gedren. Sonja rides across the land in search of Gedren's lair. Along the way she picks up travelling companions in the shape of a boy prince, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith). She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean Kalidor (!) - who offers to join her in her quest. Initially Sonja doesn't want the help of Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), preferring instead to prove that she can confront and defeat her enemies alone, but eventually she warms to him and accepts his assistance.Red Sonja is a staggeringly poor film, all the more so when one muses that it was made in 1985 when the sword 'n' sorcery genre was close to its end. It seems so simplistic and amateurish that one could easily mistake it for an early example of its kind. The performances are poor on the whole, ranging from Bergman's embarrassingly OTT villain to Reyes' unbelievably irritating spoilt brat to Schwarzenegger's wooden and unenthusiastic hero. Nielsen is slightly better as the heroine - presumably full of enthusiasm at the thought of being in her first starring role - but she is let down very badly by the stupidity of Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser's script. The film is riddled with goofs, including a scene where Schwarzenegger is seen in close-up hacking down bad guys but in a long-shot in the same sequence there isn't a corpse in sight. Technically it is very inept too, with sub-standard special effects and appallingly mechanical monsters. There are a few compensations, such as Ennio Morricone's enjoyable music (Morricone spent a great deal of the '80s providing good music for awful films, e.g The Island, Treasure of the Four Crowns and Hundra). Another compensation is Giuseppe Rotunno's lensing of the locations - in fact, much of the time it's a hell of a lot more gratifying to look at the lovely scenery than the actors standing in the foreground! There were very few sword 'n' sorcery films after Red Sonja, so in some ways it might go down in history as the film which destroyed its own genre.

Evil Queen Gedren steals a mystical talisman from a group of virginal priestess warriors, and butchers them all in the process. She plans to unleash a great evil on the world, but one her victim's was the sister of Sonja, a fearless warrior. She decides to travel to Gedren, stop her plans, and get revenge. On her way she meets an impudent young Prince and his servant, and Kalidor, a great swordsman. Together they try to save the world, but Kalidor and Sonja still wish to prove to each other who is the superior fighter.Unfortunately the whole film looks cheap, and most of the effects aren't great. Even the sweeping camera-work used to great effect in Conan the Barbarian is nowhere near as good here, and the plot is basic. Arnie is good in the role, but his part is not very big. Neilson is OK, credit must go to both for their training and stunt-work, but she fails to show any great emotion. The character is not given much depth though, focused on revenge rather than going through any grieving process. The young Prince is constantly annoying, but he and his master do provide a few laughs. Bergman is good as Gedren, but she has begun to be typecast which is unfortunate as she is a strong performer. The action is good, but without proper involvement in the story it seems hollow. Arnie fans should enjoy it, but it is over course vastly inferior to his later and prior classics. Still an average fantasy though.6 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Reminds me of the good-old Drive-In movie days.","Date":"5 December 2003","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  This movie gets better with age.

I did not spot one stunt double in the fight scenes. Schwarzenegger shows great confidence (as expected) in the action scenes.The cinematography is nice, as are some of the visual effects, with matte paintings courtesy of the master, Albert Whitlock.

Howard. Ultimately, this movie is a trifle compared to the original Conan the Barbarian, but if the viewer isn't too demanding, it may yield adequate entertainment.Like Conan the Destroyer, it's supposedly aimed at a younger demographic, but is actually a little strong for its PG-13 rating, with some gory bits, decapitations, implied rape, and the lesbian overtures made by the villainess towards the heroine.The movie is basically competently made, with good production design (by Danilo Donati) and stunts, reasonably diverting swordplay, and a decent pace (this only runs 89 minutes long). There's also a fairly effective score by the great Ennio Morricone. However, there's never much of a sense of danger; this story definitely lacks edge.Said story centres around the title character, played by Brigitte Nielsen in the role that introduced her. She's a warrior whose people were wiped out by an evil queen (Sandahl Bergman, who of course was Valeria in Conan the Barbarian) and she embarks on a quest to destroy a powerful talisman that's fallen into the queens' hands. Her fellow travellers include muscle bound Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger, presumably doing a favour for Fleischer), an insufferable brat of a prince (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and the princes' put-upon, comedy relief guardian Falkon (Paul L. Smith).The acting ranges from acceptable (also appearing is Ronald Lacey of Raiders of the Lost Ark as the queens' creepy flunky) to just incredibly laughable. Nielsen and Bergman are so terrible that their performances are sure to generate some big guffaws from the viewer. Still, they both look great, and that has to count for something. Reyes Jr. certainly does succeed at making his character annoying.While it manages to remain watchable throughout, this is pretty forgettable once it's over. It's got some amusing moments, but none to give it any real spark.Five out of 10.

Figuring to give it another shot, I pressed forward and managed to make it through Schwarzennegger's self-professed worst movie ever. At least he was honest about it, which is as much as you can ask. I guess if you were going to team up Mr. Olympia with a female counterpart, Brigitte Nielsen does seem a natural with her height and physique, providing some credibility as an Amazon-type queen.For a warrior genre film, this one had it's comical moments among all the fighting and swordplay. Arnold has a Johnny Weissmuller moment when he battles the mechanical mini-Kraken, the idea of which is fairly ludicrous considering the era when this would have taken place. Then there's that scene where Sonja, Kalidor and Prince Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) hug the face of a rock wall attempting to traverse a narrow ledge, when all of a sudden, Falkon (Paul Smith) breezes by on foot just two feet below them on solid ground. What were they thinking with that one?As far as goofs go, keep an eye on Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) right after she reveals the scar on her face in the latter part of the picture. She immediately begins her sword fight with Sonja, and repeated shots of her face show the scar no longer there, except one time when it reappeared.As for the junior Reyes, I kept thinking a diminutive Bolo Yeung, the resemblance was uncanny. I guess it's a credit to his ability to pull it off that most viewers find him just plain annoying. Come to think of it, I wouldn't have been too upset at the finale if Arnold might have dropped the beam.

Gallant master swordsman Kalidor (essayed with charming stiffness by Arnold Schwarzenegger) helps Sonja out. Director Richard Fleischer, working from a sublimely silly script by Clive Exton and George McDonald, treats the blithely inane story with gloriously ludicrous seriousness, thereby giving this jaw-dropping tosh a certain lovably asinine appeal that's impossible to either resist or dislike. Moreover, the plentiful sword fights are staged with rip-roaring skill and gusto, with the ferocious final confrontation between Sonja and Gedren rating as a definite exciting highlight. The cast has a field day with the cheerfully absurd material Ernie Reyes Jr. as bratty and arrogant little boy Prince Tarn, Paul Smith as Tarn's loyal bodyguard Falkon, Ronald Lacey as Gedren's slimy and sniveling henchman Ikol, and Pat Roach as disgusting fat pig Brytag. Familiar Italian exploitation cinema siren Janet Agren has a small part as Sonja's ill-fated sister Varna. The flashy special effects, lush scenery, Giuseppe Rotunno's sumptuous cinematography, the lavish sets and costumes, and especially Ennio Morricone's robust and majestic full-bore orchestral score give this endearing twaddle an impressive sense of scope.

Teaming up with a mercenary and a boy King, the heroine travels to the Queen's palace to fulfil her destiny.A sword and sorcery epic which is let down by wooden acting and a lethargic, plodding storyline. Following Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer as a sort of semi-sequel, there is also a surprisingly lack of onscreen violence, with only one or two beheadings, no blood spraying anywhere, people just being run through with swords. Red Sonja may not be the worst of the worst but it is pretty uninspiring.Brigitte Nielsen (Terminal Force) stars in her first role. Surprisingly she turns out to be even more wooden than her co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger. Nielsen might look good in a tunic but she totally lacks any natural charisma which makes her character a difficult one to like. Sadly Schwarzenegger is relegated to a supporting role in this one and he is given little to do apart from hack up some bad guys and do some silly strongman acts. Sandahl Bergman makes a good, wicked villainess but she sprouts cliched dialogue which makes her look idiotic. Ronald Lacey (the Nazi in Raiders of the Lost Ark) also appears but is wasted in a supporting role. Look hard and you may spot Italian exploitation babe Janet Agren filling out a minor role.The film opens with some pillaging, burning, a massacre and a young survivor swearing vengeance. Strange, exactly the same of both The Beastmaster and Conan the Barbarian. To add insult to injury there is only ONE monster in the entire film, an underwater creature made of metal which Arnie gets to ride in the film's highlight. Negative points include an annoying kid who should have been wasted and some poor comic relief. At least the ending picks up and there's ample opportunity for shots of falling rubble and a hilarious moment where Arnie holds up a pillar using just his back - he's that strong.

Initially high on the film's mix of swordfighting, skin, and magic, I eventually became a fan of Robert Howard's fantasy writing and the film seemed to suffer greatly by comparison. Of course such overly literal comparisons are un-necessary. Red Sonja is only marginally even a Robert Howard character, and more a creation of Marvel Comics' Roy Thomas and others. But she does walk the same dusty streets as Conan and Kull, and her Conan-esquire prince in this one is supposed to be a Hyrkanian Lord named Kalidor (Arnold Schwartzenneger). What should be said is that the character is not identical to Conan, but Arnold's performance as Kalidor is exactly the same as his interpretation of Conan.He seems only too happy to sink into the background as much as possible on this one; his original Conan co-star Sandahl Bergman is comparatively ambitious and scenery-chewing as a witch queen who seizes a glowing orb that controls the weather. As for the star of the show, Brigitte Nielsen, the less said of her acting by far the better. Seeing as most Italian movies are fixed in post-production, I'm astounded that even dubbing could not have solved some of the most woeful problems with her lack of inflection. There's literally no emotion in her voice at any time really. On the positive side, that does make her an equal match for Schwartzenneger. Ernie Reyes Jr., who made his film debut in Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon the previous year, is fun comic diversion as an undisciplined prince, and he shows off his martial arts skills to good effect.The best thing about the film is the great score supplied by Ennio Morricone which lifts everything up a notch. The matte work is also quite well done, and despite what perhaps others have said about the film its production values are generally high just as usual for a DeLaurentis production. The photography is quite beautiful in some places, thanks to Giuseppe Rotunno (who also shot Gilliam's lovely Baron Munchausen), but Richard Fleischer's monotonous direction drags the film down at every opportunity when it could have soared. The script is very hollow too -- basically the plot consists of leaving one member or other of the group behind so that he can suddenly appear in time to *surprise* save the rest from whatever monster they've encountered.Basically what we have here is something that you can enjoy if you have a few drinks in you, the music and the photography will carry you if you're in the mood for a fantasy vibe, but the acting in general and the story are very dull.

It's been over twenty years, and I still think it's cheesier than a garish purple Mack truck hung with bling-bling and stuffed to the gills with Velveeta.Not only is the acting bad, but the casting is even worse, and the dialogue just rounds it off into the depths of the infinitely awful. Red Sonja is... well... bad. Just... bad. I remember one fabulously dramatic shot wherein our brave female hero is dashing down the hall of the Wicked Queen Gedren's castle she pauses right in front of the camera after running about fifteen paces; there's a super-tense closeup as her eyes dart around the empty corridor, looking for... well, I'm not really sure, since there's nothing but camera and blank walls around her. But the eyes darting? Oh yeah. Real tension there. And just when you think you can't take it any more, she yells in this grating, echoic voice, Gedren!! Where are you!?? And as she says the word you, her lips purse up into this awful horse-mouth, and you're looking at four stories of gums there. I laughed at that even as a six-year old. And where IS Gedren? Well, gee, I dunno, try the THRONE ROOM. Even the stupid kid managed to figure THAT one out, honey. Why are you the hero, again? Prince Tarn has got to be one of the most annoying children on the face of the earth, although his fighting scenes are admittedly cool, and I'll admit that by the end of the film, I was hoping he'd get killed off. Oh yeah, and his big, fat, clumsy bodyguard is the typical big, fat, clumsy stereotype, right down to his weapon, which happens to be a club made out of some sort of LEG BONE. Hands up if you immediately thought he'd eaten the meat off that bone, decided it was the best doggone meal he'd ever had, and decided to dry the bone out and keep it as a memento. C'mon, you so did.And while we're talking stereotypes here - Gedren. Good God, the woman is a walking billboard for anti-lesbian/feminist sentiment. Let's see, she slaughters an entire colony of people for the illegitimate offspring of a Jell-O Jiggler and a Lite-Brite - which only women can touch, of course - and proceeds to hit on poor scantily-clad Sonja with as much finesse and grace as a drunken panda driving a four-wheeler through a nitroglycerin plant. When Sonja refuses the Queen's oh-so-winsome advances, the latter has the former gang-raped by a bunch of big nasty guards. Of COURSE she does. And just in case Sonja missed the whole rape-and-pillage thing, not to worry, the villain fires up the Ford Exposition and EXPLAINS it to her.Enter Kalidor, stage right, looking exactly like Conan, sounding exactly like Conan, and acting like he's got a bad head cold and is doped out on NyQuil. Get used to it, he doesn't get any better. Except for maybe that part where he grabs that annoying kid and lifts him up in the air with one hand and gives him this look that says, If you don't shut the #$%^ up, I'm going to beat the crap out of you with this block of Velveeta. Yeah, I kinda liked that bit.The ending fight sequences are really and truly awful, right from the moment Sonja walks in and starts trying to sound tough. Sonja You slaughtered my parents! Like CATTLE! My brother, MY SISTER!! Gedren Vermin! What were their lives compared to THIS!? (rips off her sequined Mardi Gras mask to reveal horribly fake scars, from a wound inflicted by Sonja) Sonja You're a MAN! The Talisman will destroy you!Apparently Gedren can't come up with a witty retort for this, or even a basic denial, so she just gapes like a goldfish. Wretched.Then, of course, comes the big battle scene in the room stocked with a squillion candles, the big iron gate comes down, the swordfight begins, and the rest of our heroes come rushing over to watch and eat popcorn. Kalidor, in a burst of incredible stupidity, shouts, Sonja! Over here! What the ^&*@ does he expect her to do? Stop fighting and go, Oh, hey guys? Maybe he's just trying to make her turn and look at him, in which case Gedren could get in a cheap decapitation and mercifully end the film. Unfortunately, this isn't what happens.Of course the Evil Lesbian Queen gets her dues, the good guys get out, and for no particular reason at all... the castle blows up. Repeatedly. Seriously - the parapet blows up, cut to the good guys running. The upper level blows up, cut to the good guys running. The main bulk of the castle blows up, cut to the good guys diving behind a rock for cover. Aaaaand the parapet blows up again. Cut to the good guys cowering. Aaaaaand the parapet blows up AGAIN. I am not making this up. After they've blown up the castle three or four times, a huge unexplained pillar of flame rises from the ashes, and thank GOD for that, because if the parapet had blown up one more time, I would've begun thinking they were changing something in the Matrix, and I would've had to check and make sure my windows hadn't become brick walls.All in all, yes, it's a terrible movie, but you'll laugh yourself sick, and that's what makes it fabulous.

This film is directed by Richard Fleischer who also directed 'Conan the Destroyer', the same studio, Dino De Laurentiis Company, made all three films, Sandahl Bergman was in this film and 'Conan the Barbarian' and of course Arnie starred in all three.I mean lets be honest here, Arnie plays Lord Kalidor, the character is virtually a Conan clone, I dunno why they didn't just make him Conan and be done with it. I believe Sonja comes from the Conan universe originally (I may be wrong) so why not? I'm guessing there may have been copyright issues somewhere.So its the same story again for this fantasy adventure, need I describe the plot? A small band of goodies up against an evil baddie leader and all her baddie warriors who are all holed up in an intimidating fortress. Arnie rides around in his rather unattractive red sparkly jumpsuit (changes to a black number out of the blue half way through) whilst Nielsen sports a long red mullet cut, but she's still cute.This is suppose to be the weakest of the Arnie broadsword adventures but personally I don't see it. Its no worse than the other two and gives you just as much visual sorcery. In fact there's more fantasy stuff going on here than 'CtB', giant pet spiders, giant skeleton bridges, a metallic sea monster thingy and a silly Flash Gordon style baddie wizard. This film boarders more on other films such as 'Krull' and a bit of 'Willow' in my opinion.Reasonable amounts of blood and limb chopping but not overkill. Everything looks a bit tacky later on in the film but again no worse than the other two films. Unfortunately there is an annoying kid in this film, kinda like Data from 'The Goonies' or Short Round from 'Temple of Doom' (same kid actor there), tends to give the film a more slapstick approach at times, 'Conan the Barbarian' was always the most grown up of the three.At this point I reckon Arnie was possibly getting worried he may end up typecast as a barbarian meathead in fantasy films. I can see why this was his last as all three of these films are very similar and not overly wonderful frankly. Still the musical score was always in good hands with Morricone at the helm, how did they manage that? As a kid I loved these films, nowadays the rose tinted shades can't quite save them, amusing and naff, oh and the baddie Queen is a lesbian. Oh yeah, the whole story is down to Sonja simply rejecting her advances at the start, fancy that.5/10 "}{"Title":"Not good, but entertaining in some ways","Date":"16 December 2011","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" Red Sonja (1985) is essentially Conan 3, after Conan the Barbarian (1982) and Conan the Destroyer (1984). Schwarzenegger plays the barbarian 'Kalidor' here because the filmmakers didn't have the rights to the 'Conan' name since 'Red Sonja' was owned by a company separate from the REH people, yet -- strangely -- they could use REH's Hyborian setting (albeit in a half-axxed way).Red Sonja is the least of the three films. In other words, if you couldn't stomach parts of Conan the Destroyer you'll loathe Red Sonja. It starts out pretty good but by the 25-minute mark the cartooney goofiness kicks in with the introduction of Prince Tarn (the spoiled child who deems himself a king) and his loyal assistant Falkon. The sword & sorcery silliness turns full throttle by the final act. Needless to say, Robert E. Howard was rolling over in the grave at such roll-your-eyes treatment of his S&S fantasy world.It's strange because, for the most part, the film gets the LOOK of the Hyborian Age down pretty good, although there are some really fake-looking props/costumes/effects here and there. But, generally speaking, they did a decent job with the locations, costumes, cast and props. The problem is the overall cartooney vibe. It's like Conan for kids or something and it's almost saddening to observe all this expense & effort wasted by the inexplicable decision to go the camp route. It ruins what could have been a quality REH-influenced picture. John Milius' Conan the Barbarian may have deviated from REH but it made up for it by taking Conan and the Hyborian Age seriously, not that it was totally humorless. Laughter and lightness are an intrinsic part of life but they don't need to devolve into campy silliness. Red Sonja,, by contrast, is so silly at points that it's impossible to take seriously.Which isn't to say it's all bad. If you're in the right mode Red Sonja can fill the bill. It's not good, and you can't take it too seriously, but it's somewhat entertaining. What works? For one, as already noted, the film scores decently as far as visuals go. For instance, the Italian locations are gorgeous and, although Brigitte Nielsen in all her 6-foot glory doesn't match the comic's depiction of Red Sonja, I have to admit that she's pleasant to look at, and her swordplay is pretty impressive. Also, the score by Ennio Morricone (famous for scoring all those spaghetti-Westerns back in the day, like The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly) is pretty good too, although no where near the exceptionality of Basil Poledouris' compositions for the first two Conan flick; those are in a league of their own.Also, although Prince Tarn & Falkon are roll-your-eyes characters, you can't help but start to like them as the story progresses. As a matter of fact, the story in general pretty much maintains your attention, despite the silly antics.Another plus is Sandahl Bergman as the villain queen, but the filmmakers dropped the ball here because she appears fully clothed from head to toe throughout. The thing is, although Sandahl's face isn't ultra-cute like Brigitte's, Sandahl has a killer body that far exceeds Brigitte's. But you won't see it here; you'll have to re-watch Conan the Barbarian for that. Not that I'm suggesting a need for nudity or sex; it's just that Sandahl's a gorgeous woman and they should have taken advantage of that with some more form-fitting attire to show-off her beauty. But she still looks great here, particularly in black hair and a cool mask.BOTTOM LINE Red Sonja is a real mixed bag. It fails as a cinematic interpretation of REH's Hyborian world, but only because the filmmakers opted for kid-friendly goofiness at the expense of brutal S&S pseudo-reality. However, the film looks and sounds good, for the most part.

Being this is a story set in the same universe, I really expected it to be as good as the earlier movies.Sadly, this is not the case. Red Sonja feels a bit too civilized for a world as brutal as Hyboria. She speaks as if she's a lawyer in the courtroom instead of fighting with big swords. Arnie does quite a good job playing Kalidor. His only really let down was a scene where he put on an overacted cheeky grin towards Sonja which really made me chuckle. But these things are small compared to the movie's major flaw The child.About 1/3 into the movie, this child gets introduced but I wish the scriptwriters had never included him. He is so irritating and constantly shouts Ya ya ya which will make your ears bleed. Its so annoying and he has a role till the very end of the movie. Now I don't know if Sonja shares the same idea, but she actually comments that the boy shouldn't be so annoying and be thought a lesson. I really think she has the right idea! If you didn't know of a movie that was ruined by a child, now you do know.In you are a fantasy fan, I would recommend picking this up but don't expect it to be as good as Conan the Destroyer (which was an alright film, but not great) and not nearly as good as Conan the Barbarian.

Like both the Conan Movies, and later films like Masters of the Universe 1987, it has just about the right blend of adventure and fantasy, not to mention the odd racy sword play action, but iam afraid that Red Sonja is a classic example of all style and no substance, and unfortunately, as i watch it now as an adult, iam forced to admit that it doesn't bear to well with repeated viewings, let alone close scruitiny. The main problem is the direction. Richard Fliescher's direction is usually reasonable, and at the very least watchable, but as the director of Red Sonja, he has on his hands one of the worst and most embarrising leading ladies ever in Brigitte Nielsen, who cant have been the easiest person to work with. You would think that with Fleischer's experience he would have at least have been able to get something good from Nielsen onto the screen, he fails. Wich raises the question, why was Nielsen chosen in the first place. Maybe Sylvester Stallone's star power led her to it, maybe she managed to get round the producers herself. Either way she is the major flaw, and the final nail in the coffin of a little, but well meaning Adventure fantasy movie. Richard Fleisher, who streched things a little in Conan The Destroyer, comes up with even worse scenarios here, such as Sonja's Sister dying, cue She's dead from Kalidor Ah-Nold. Some action set pieces, such as the young prince being roasted by thugs, or Sonja's and Kalidor's exhaustion after a fake duel, are plain embara ssing. Equally baffling is the casting choice of Sandhal Bergman, Conan's dommed lover in Conan The Barbarian, to play the villainess here. Bergman is a strong actor, and a beautiful prescence but can't come to grips with the demands of a screen heavy. Maybe it is that i cant see her as anything other than a hero, Bergman, though would have made a far stronger Red Sonja than Brigitte Nielsen did. You would be forgiven for expecting too much from the screenplay by future Poirot writer Clive Exton and Octopussy 1983 scribe George MacDonald Fraser. The sad thing about the script is that ther is actually a good story hidden away beneath the tragedy of Red Sonja, and you get the impression that it was written in either a rush or chopped and changed in pre-production. On a better note the costumes and sets by Donello Doneti, a Dino De Laurentiis regular, are beautiful, with the most impressive being the red gartments worn by Kalidor, Sonja's armour well filled by Nielsen it has to be said The Swords and Weapons, and on the set stakes the impressive torch lit palaces and watery grave of sankes at the movies climax. Ennio Morricone's score is quite impressive too. Perhaps not in the league of the mighty and thunderous Basil Poledouris Conan scores wich would have enhanced Red Sonja immensly, but quite good in their own right. In the end though, there is only one thing that makes Red Sonja work and his name is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold manages to bring a light of touch and humour to the role of Kalidor,in what little material he is given, an obvious Conan clone, and is once again impressive in the action scenes and sword play, and does well to carry Nielsen through the movie. It is a pitty that De Laurentiis didn't just comision another Conan movie instead, the legacy of wich is that John Milius is returning to direct King Conan  Crown of Iron, with Scwarzenegger and The Matrix Maestro's Andy and Larry Wachowski. Red Sonja though is in another world and rating that both old and new Conan movies and can only be seen as a fairly enjoyable and at times exciting waste of time.

I thought the acting by the beautiful Brigitte Nielsen was adequate, and she was physically the perfect actress for the role. The natural good- natured personality of Sandahl Bergman made her an unwise choice for the role of an evil queen, but being an intelligent actress, she did a credible job.The scene where they fought the machine in the water was rather silly and dragged on too long. What was the director thinking? The latter part of the movie (when Sonja was fighting Gedren and when the castle was gradually breaking down and exploding) was likewise childishly predictable and silly in parts.

With these woefully wooden performers sharing much of the screen-time, working from a pitiful script that is heavy on the cheeze, Red Sonja is unintentionally camp, mid-80s sword and sorcery adventure that proves far more amusing than thrilling.In the film's horribly trite opening scene, young Sonja rejects the sexual advances of evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman), slashing the wicked ruler's face as she struggles to escape; as a result, the queen orders her guards to kill Sonja's family and gang rape the insolent young woman. Years later, having learnt fighting skills from an old master, Sonja is given the opportunity to settle the score when she embarks on a quest to recover a powerful talisman that has been stolen by the despotic Queen Gedren. Together with man mountain Kalidor (Arnie), irritating Prince Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his willing slave Falkon (Paul L. Smith), Sonja travels to the queen's fortress to destroy the talisman and put an end to Gedren's tyranny.Despite fairly decent production values&#x97;the film boasts impressive sets and costumery, reasonable effects (including some lovely matte paintings), spectacular cinematography, a rousing score from Ennio Morricone, and some well choreographed swordplay&#x97;Red Sonja is a rather embarrassing addition to the barbarian genre as a whole. The flat direction from Richard Fleischer renders the action scenes ineffective, the acting is diabolical, the storyline and dialogue utterly asinine, and the film's uneven tone makes it hard to figure out who the intended audience was much of the movie seems light-hearted and rather juvenile at times, but the severed limbs and gouts of blood make it unsuitable viewing for children.Of course, quite a few giggles can be had from the film's shoddier elements, which include a glowing wood spirit that inexplicably bestows special powers on Sonja (although just what these powers are is never really clear), Arnie riding a mechanical water dragon, Queen Gedren's giant vibrating pet spider, and a shonky steam-driven video screen that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Buster Crabbe Flash Gordon serial from the 30s.

The plot was definitely timid, and the runtime short... but Destroyer was equally painful. The acting? Let's just say I think both films had lame character development, acting and direction. The special effects were pretty bad in Destroyer, and this movie follows suit. I had heard in advance about a particular fight scene with a metallic creature that was the low point of the film. This shocked me, because for me it was the high point! I suppose I should also mention that the music is pretty good, if only in contrast to how horrible everything else in the film is.At any rate, it's hardly worth going over the cinematic aspects of a film like this. I think ultimately it is the coolness factor that is of the utmost importance. Red Sonja has a very low coolness factor. And why? Why is it rated less than Destroyer?2 very important reasons- No Conan. Seriously, no one cares about Red Sonja or Kalidor. - Little screen time and dialogue for Schwarzenegger.

Given the atrociously awkward script and low-budget feel of the production, I thought she did no wrong. She looks different enough (the mask helped) that you can allow yourself to be fooled. She was originally wanted to play Sonja herself, but wisely chose to play the villain instead. She does the best she can with what little they gave her and is worth watching.Brigitte Nielsen... OK, she is pretty and had the right look at the time, but it's clear she'll not be winning any Oscars for this performance. The voice dubbing made it worse and she sounds like Deanna Troi. Fresh off the boat from Denmark, she was hired on the basis of a modelling shoot... and it shows.Supposedly there were some issues with the rights to the planned third Conan film, or some-such, so this was a way to have Arnie playing Conan again in everything but name.

Sure there were more afterwards but never to the same high profile as before Sonja.The movie is the third film from the Conan series by Robert E. Howard started with Conan the Barbarian and Conan the Destroyer. Red Sonja is a character from Marvel Comics' adaptation loosely adapted from a Howard character. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who played Conan in the last two, plays Lord Kalidor. Why they didn't name him Conan is anyone's guess since he is basically the same exact character and would have created some interesting continuity between them.First, what I liked about it. The technical aspects of Red Sonja is as good as Conan the Barbarian and Destroyer. The sets and creatures look as good as the others. Sonja may not make any big technical leaps forward but nothing looks worse. And visually, the style looks the same helping with some continuity. It seems like the producers were able to do the most they could with their lower budget.The acting is also about the same. I never thought much of the series' acting before and there are no improvements but overall it stays the same. At least it's consistent. However, this was Brigitte Nielsen's first role and shows she wasn't ready to headline a movie yet, or at all. This is another reason why it should have been Schwarzenegger as Conan, with Nielsen in a secondary role like she was in Rocky IV.Some characters seem to acknowledge the silliness of it all, while others take things seriously. It's not as overly silly as Destroyer, though could have been more serious like Barbarian. The tone was certainly handled better than Destroyer.The music is also quite entertaining. May not be catchy but it is effective and sounds good.Now for the bad, which is to say everything else. Schwarzenegger has all the charm in the movie, and whenever he's not on the movie drags. It's hard to get into a movie when the title character is played so blandly. Most of the characters are pretty one-dimensional and bland without much to do. The story is predictable, but at other times the story is muddled and you don't know why characters act the way they do.Overall, the movie failed to justify itself. There didn't seem to be much reason beyond cashing in on Schwarzenegger's two Conan movies' fame. Sonja fails to prove that she is anything but a Conan clone. I've never read the comics, or the Howard books, but I'm sure that the worst of Sonja's stories never felt as tedious as this film.Schwarzenegger said he uses this film to punish his children. I wouldn't exactly call that fair. You can either view this as a so-bad-it's-good or not-quite-as-bad-as-people-say kind of movie. And certainly Junior or End of Days is more punishing to sit through.The whole sword-and-sorcery genre and Hyborian Age was fun while it lasted and there certainly were some interesting ideas thrown around. Much like how superheroes movies rose, fell, and was resurrected, I hope SAS films get their own revitalization. I write this the same weekend as the Conan the Barbarian reboot/remake was released, but given the poor reviews there's not much hope on seeing more Hyborians in film. "},{"Title":"O Sonja!

Neither of them can act(few in this can); she's particularly atrocious, being utterly expressionless. This is cheesy, and there are many silly designs. The plot is without surprises. Editing and cinematography are unremarkable. There is a lot of occasionally bloody violence and brief gratuitous toplessness(and numerous scantily clad hot chicks) in this. I recommend this to fans of the sword and sorcery fantasy genre, B-movies and of the trilogy.

Howard character after the massive success of the two Conan movies with Red Sonja. This one features a female warrior played by Brigitte Nielsen, a Danish model. To sweeten the deal a little, they brought in Arnold Schwarzenegger for support. His name might as well have been Conan, as Schwarzenegger does nothing to differentiate this barbarian (named Kalidor) from the more famous one. The story has Red Sonja tracking down the murderer of her sister and stealer of a sacred talisman, Queen Gedren, played by the ugliest beautiful woman in the world, Sandahl Bergman (her face is behind a weird mask most of the movie, which might make normal women look uglier but which improves her looks). Along the way, Sonja has some ill-defined adventures in cheap-looking landscapes. Along the way, she picks up a child ruler and his manservant (Ernie Reyes Jr. and Paul L. Smith respectively), and the four heroes make a kind of Wizard of Oz-like quartet as they battle Bergman's warriors. This movie is generally a bunch of crap, overproduced but somehow still cheap looking. Still, it's kind of entertainingly bad. The acting alone made me giggle almost constantly - it's pretty sad when pint-sized ninja Reyes is the best performer in the film (he co-starred in The Last Dragon the same year). This is the kind of movie you don't mind seeing remade, and the new one is coming next year, and is starring Rose McGowan. Color me cautiously optimistic for that one.

The plot of the movie is this Sonja(Brigitte Nielson) hails from a tribe of female warriors who were killed off by an evil queen Gedren(Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb the female warriors were protecting and uses it to destroy each town she passes by. Sonja goes on a hunt for Queen Gedren and later finds out that Gedren killed her parents. On her quest she reluctantly joins Kalidor(Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn(Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his bumbling idiotic servant, Falkon(Paul L. Smith). Together they go on a hunt for Queen Gedren and the orb. The acting is sub par and the action scenes are soso. I mean Briggite Neilson looks so emotionally distant. For someone who lost her whole family as well as her female comrades, Sonja doesn't look fazed at all. Arnold is playing his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr.... what an annoying snot-nosed brat he was in this movie! The moronic manservant Falkon had more personality than these guys. The action scenes are the only redeeming moments of the movie even though sometimes they fall flat. The scene where they fight the mechanical sea creature made me laugh till my ribs ached. The dialog is a hoot also. Its as if the screenwriter thought that nobody was going to take the movie seriously so he gave everybody stupid lines to work with.

The story of this movie is quiet good, carrying lots of fantasy elements in it like guardian beasts, huge spiders, wicked queens, and a powerful artifact that can destroy the world. Unfortunately the acting is really bad. One may think that the actors in this movie, even the famous Arnie, never went to acting school. This is surprising because Neilson was much better in Beverly Hills Cop II. But in this movie most of the lines were poorly delivered and the script was incredibly corny.The plot is a typical fantasy plot. A powerful artifact is to be destroyed but the wicked queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergmen) comes along with her powerful army and kills all of the priestesses and steals the talisman. The thing about the talisman is that only a woman can touch it so Gedren is very happy. She then takes the Talisman to he castle and begins her plan to conquer the world. Sonja, who has come afoul of Gedren before, learns of the attack in which her sister is killed and storms off after Gedren.This movie seems to be an anti-feminist movie. Women have the power in this movie, in regards to the talisman, and play a prominent part. Sonja hates men and believes that she can get along with out having to rely upon any man. Yet Prince Kalidor (Arnold Swartzenegger) always appears and fights for her when it seems that she is almost defeated. This movie seems to try to say that women and men need to work together and they cannot write each other out. There is also the idea, as symbolised by Kalidor and Sonja being swordspeople of equal ability, that there is no difference between men and women and that they are equals.It is a shame that most fantasy movies only come out as half-hearted attempts at some entertainment. There is truly very few good fantasy movies on the shelves of the video store. Fantasy is more of an uncliched genre as it has not really been explored as much as it could be. So far it has remained the realm of the novel but there is much room for it to move to the big screen.

She is just awful in every department. Maybe I'm wrong, but I've always wondered whether her casting had anything to do with her relationship with Sylvester Stallone. Compared to the buxom comic character in her chain mail bikini, the skinny Nielsen looks awkward, is an unconvincing fighter and her total lack of charisma soon relegated her to the world of low budget straight to video. Sandahl Bergman is totally wasted in her role as the evil queen, and her shiny spandex outfit is one of the worst of the costumes in a movie obviously aimed at a PG audience.

Obviously taking influence from the similarly themed &#145;Conan' movies, this film fails to prove as enjoyable and eventually fails to entertain at all.Bridgette Neilsen stars as Sonja, a beautiful woman who has been given unbelievable strength by a ghostly figure after her village was pillaged, her family killed and she herself raped by the soldiers of Queen Gedran (Sandahl Bergman). Gedran is a tyrant Queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks out a talisman protected by Sonja's sister to do it. After discovering what has happened Sonja sets out for revenge and at the same time she must save the world from the wrath of Gedran. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the master of the talisman, sets out to protect her whether she wants him there or not.The first major problem with this movie is the beginning. The events leading up to the point where Sonja receives her powers could have easily made a good ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable film. However, the beginnings are rushed into what seems like a quick one-minute `Previously on&#133;.' segment from a television show. Had they actually made these events part of the story and cut out some of the filler later on they may have been able to start redeeming this movie but unfortunately they didn't (I wonder why director Richard Fleischer has only currently directed two movies since Red Sonja).This film also features some of the most annoying characters in history like Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) who is a stupid character and just adds an over abundance of camp to the movie, which sometimes works but in this case fails miserably. He was quite obviously written into the movie for some comic relief but with the overall absurdity of the film anyway this was another costly mistake for &#145;Red Sonja'.For all it's faults there were some good fight scenes involving both Neilsen and Arnie which are worth noting but these are nowhere enough to save this turkey.

In fact, the best swords-and-sorcery film I could think of before Lord Of The Rings was George Lucas's kiddie-friendly Willow. Perhaps, in view of this, one should go a little easy on this film. But I can't - it's poorly written, badly acted (with the exception of Paul Smith, who's just average) and dreadfully put together. The film is as convincing as an episode of the Flintstones, with costumes and scenery seemingly lifted straight outta Bedrock. Considering the comic-book source material, it is easy to forgive the various plot inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the most annoying kid, in this world or that one, is bewildering. His personality seems to flick from spoilt brat to polite gentleman at the flick of a switch. Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the motions, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in The Terminator.It's simple to kick a film when you're down but the fact remains that this is not a good film, by any stretch of the imagination. When Nielsen mourns the death of her sister and Schwarzenegger tenderly places his hand on her shoulder to comfort her and then blurts out, in that distinctive Germanic accent, she's dead then you know you're in for a rough ride. A few smiles were raised at inappropriate points, such as the priestesses of a temple who, when sent plunging to their deaths in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy the experience - at least, judging from the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. If you have to watch an Eighties fantasy film that wasn't porn, watch Willow (but never take that as a ringing endorsement).

Because 1) a movie like this should draw its strength upon good swordfights and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. It is simple, and uncomplicated and really offers nothing in way of character development or even suspense. It is predictable and boring, and the obvious couple, Sonja and Kalidor, has no chemistry at all. And the kid is just annoying. And most of the scenes is drawn out so long that they become boring. Though the movie is not very long, it has not material enough to fill its time. And so back to point 1). The fighting is slow, uneventful and really bad. It clearly shows most fighters clearly blocking the opponents strokes far ahead of the opponent has even begun to strike. In my honest opinion, I believe most kids, fighting with sticks, creates more exciting fights playing knights than this movie did. All in all, this is a really bad spin-off, that should be avoided by all who liked the Conan-movies.2/10 "},{"Title":"Why is Arnold in this?","Date":"14 March 2003","Score":"3 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  I figure the company that made this movie wanted people to think of the Conan movies, but unfortunately for the ones who made this one it does just that.  You will be thinking, man the Conan movies were pretty cool...this one is totally boring and sucks.  The story, who cares?  It isn't going to help you like this movie more or less as it just seems like a really cheap film.  Arnold, doesn't look like he belongs in this one, why he agreed to play the role is beyond me.  Well probably for the money.  I just love the monster in the water that turns out to be a machine.  Lame!  This movie is just plain and simply terrible.

He co-stars, protecting Brigitte Nielsen, the `Red Sonja' -- a red-haired, tough woman, who is trying to avenge her sister's death. She seems like a feminist-rights activist incarnate. This film is extremely slow moving and boring, which may explain why it is basically unheard of. Or perhaps it's because Arnold only co-stars &#150; something rare for the action-star. I'm not sure. `Conan the Barbarian' had a mystical fantasy-feel to it. Campy, if you will. `Red Sonja' is just inept and unoriginal &#150; trying to copy Conan's success as a film.  The only thing I know is that this film is very slow-moving, unimaginative, and boring. I really hate to see a bad Schwarzenegger film, and when I do, I hate to admit the film is  bad, but this film was really, really bad. 1.5/5 stars -John Ulmer  "},{"Title":"Poor","Date":"13 April 2003","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  This film was released soon after the Conan films, a sort of female Conan, Red Sonja played by Sylvester Stallones ex-wife Brigitte Nielsen. She's not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole film feels cheap, but strangely Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this film but not as Conan, although he looks, acts and fights like Conan from the two Conan films, I don't know what thats about. Anyway he only appears about every twenty minutes and doesn't hang around for long. Maybe Arnold filmed this in his time off from filming Conan the Destroyer or something? Anyway the film is way to slow and boring for an action film, skip this and watch Conan the Barbarian instead.

Gedren then uses the power of the talisman in her raid of Hablac. Red Sonja, sister of the keeper, sets out with her magic sword to overthrow Gedren. The talisman's master Kalidor follows to protect her. He falls for her, but Sonja's power bases on the oath to never give herself to any man...It's not a good film, the makers are just cashing in on Schwarzenegger's success with his first few movies, that is why he is first billed and is so predominant on the one sheet.The film basically consists of Sonja and her group, stalking Schwarzenegger, a little prince who is smug, and his servant, walking from one scene to the next, occasionally having a sword fight.The villains spend the majority of the film in a candle lit room, staring at an orb, until the final battle.Oh, and there is a bit with a metal snake fish.It's boring, mundane stuff, but it has wonderful scenery, and an excellent score by Morricone.This is one of those films where you'd rather stare at the one sheet because it's more entertaining.Not very good at all. "},{"Title":"Ed Wood would have been proud of this one","Date":"16 March 2004","Score":"2 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Possible Spoilers As Peter Jackson has so brilliantly shown in his `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, it is quite possible to make good films, even great ones, within the heroic fantasy genre. The genre has distinguished literary antecedents, dating back to the mediaeval chivalric romances, particularly the Arthurian legends, upon which Tolkien and other authors have drawn. `Lord of the Rings' apart, however, it is difficult to think of any other sword-and-sorcery films which are any good. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the best of a bad bunch was Ron Howard's `Willow', and even that achieved little distinction other than that of being a merely mediocre film as opposed to a positively bad one. `Red Sonja', however, cannot achieve the even more modest distinction of being simply a bad film as opposed to an appalling one.As with `Willow', many of the plot-elements in `Red Sonja' are derived from `The Lord of the Rings'. An evil ruler seeks to gain control of an artefact with supernatural powers in order to achieve an ambition of world domination, but is thwarted by an assorted group of heroes. The film, set in the Hyborian Age, a barbaric era in the earth's remote past, starts with the villain of the piece, the wicked Queen Gedren, making unwelcome sexual advances to the heroine Sonja. When these are rebuffed, Gedren (not a woman to take no for an answer) reacts by murdering Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985 it was presumably still considered politically correct not only to make the chief villain a woman but also to make one of the main motives for her villainy frustrated lesbian lust).Gedren's next move is to capture the Talisman, a sort of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, by slaughtering the whole of the scantily-dressed female priesthood charged with protecting it, just as they are about to destroy it because they feel its powers have become too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonja's sister, her sole surviving relative. Sonja herself, however, has not been idle, but has enrolled in a martial arts academy from which she graduates summa cum laude, and sets out to avenge herself. Along the way she teams up with Kalidor, a heroic wandering swordsman-king resembling Tolkien's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the spoilt child-ruler of a kingdom that has fallen to Gedren's powers, and Falkon, Tarn's loyal servant. The rest of the film is fairly predictable, as Sonja and her allies try to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the out-of-control Talisman.Just what is it that makes this film so bad? Well, the acting, for a start. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Kalidor gives the sort of typical wooden, poker-faced performance that became his trademark, at least in the early part of his career, complete with heavy foreign accent. Compared with Brigitte Nielsen as the heroine, however, he looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties, delivering every line in the mechanical, toneless voice of someone who has just completed lesson three of a `teach-yourself-English-by-correspondence' course. One wonders if she was hired for the role just to make Arnie look good by comparison. The other characters, while not conducting their own private struggles against the English language, are simply cartoonish caricatures, especially Prince Tarn who must be one of the most obnoxious screen youngsters ever.An even worse fault than the bad acting, however, is the film's almost complete lack of imagination. This is a particularly glaring fault in a fantasy film, as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power in order to persuade the audience to suspend the natural feelings of disbelief that would be provoked by a fantastic plot. When we watch Peter Jackson's masterpiece we can persuade ourselves, at least for the next three hours, that we are in Middle-Earth, that elves, wizards and hobbits do exist, and that the fate of the world really does depend upon the destruction of a magic ring. When we watch `Red Sonja' we are persuaded of nothing except that we are watching a bunch of actors with bad accents fighting one another on a hillside for possession of a lime-green football.This lack of imagination even starts with the film's title. The British science-fiction author Brian Aldiss, when challenged about the exotic names given to his characters, replied that there was little point in creating a fictional alien society with its own distinctive culture if you were going to spoil the effect by calling the hero Joe. (Admittedly, Tolkien was ableto get away with giving the name Sam to one of his main characters, but that was because Hobbits were supposed to be reassuringly familiar, the Middle-Earth equivalent of tweedy, pipe-smoking Englishmen). Similarly, giving the heroine of a tale ostensibly set in a long-gone barbaric age a common girls' name like `Sonia' (which is how the name `Sonja' is pronounced) is about as appropriate as calling her `Betty' or `Mary-Jane'.The film seems to have been made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they bothered at all. Fantasy needs to be done convincingly, or not at all. It was obviously shot in a remote mountain area, with little or no attempt to suggest a distinctive culture. The few buildings we see, such as the temple of the Talisman or Gedren's palace, are obviously cheap sets. We learn that Tarn's capital city has been destroyed by Gedren using the power of the Talisman, but we do not actually see this event; all we see is what might be a thunderstorm taking place on the other side of a hill. At first you wonder how Sonja intends to overthrow an entire kingdom with only a few allies, but when you see how small an army Gedren has at her disposal it becomes more understandable. When an earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder if this is the Talisman at work or merely a crew member inadvertently leaning against the set. If we can enjoy this film for nothing else, we can at least enjoy it for its inadvertent humour; a fine example of the so-bad-it's-funny school of filmmaking. Ed Wood would have been proud of this one. If it had been shown on Californian television the night before the recall election, Gray Davis would still be governor. 2/10.

While this was still relatively early in his career and he wasn't the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he's Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason she got much of any attention were her boobs and because she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive football player, Mark Gastineau. So, instead of this being her break out film, this and a Beverly Hills Cop movie mark about as high as she went in her one-note career. It was obvious, too, that the financing wizards gave up on this movie as well, because the supporting cast (aside from Arnold) is pretty lame and the script is dull, dull, dull. Fans looking for another CONAN movie would no doubt be very disappointed in this slow and uninvolving film.

Basically young red-headed master of the sword woman Red Sonja (introducing Razzie winning and nominated Brigitte Nielsen, best known for being married to Sylvester Stallone and Celebrity Big Brother) is seeking revenge after her brother and parents are slaughtered by the army of evil Queen Gedren (Razzie nominated Sandahl Bergman). The Queen naturally wants to take over the world, and she has stolen a powerful glowing orb that was due to be destroyed, and it is capable of control natural forces and create storms and earthquakes. Also trying to retrieve and destroy the powerful orb and save the world is warrior Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who despite her objections joins her in her quest to the same place. Joining the two fighters travelling to the lair of the Queen is the young confident and overconfident brat Prince Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his loyal servant Falkon (Paul L. Smith). In the end obviously good triumphs over evil, Red Sonja gets the revenge she was seeking, the orb is destroyed, the Queen dies in the destruction, and Kalidor and Red Sonja kiss before departing. Also starring Pat Roach as Brytag, Ronald Lacey as Ikol and Donna Osterbuhr as Kendra the High Priestess. Nielsen may look the part but is dull, Schwarzenegger should be the leading star but isn't used enough, Bergman is awful as the villain, and Reyes Jr. is very annoying as the little kung fu loving Prince, and the story is no different in quality, dull, boring and predictable, a stupid and pointless action adventure. Pretty poor! "}]
