I don't think it's any more predictable than an average Hollywood film; I find most action films much more predictable and shallow.The most beautiful thing about the movie (as about Hallström movies generally) is the wise, warm-hearted story about things that matter love, sincerity, tolerance, standing up for the things you believe are righteous and good, and enjoying the simple pleasures in life, like a good dinner with friends, or like chocolate ) And Hallström tells his stories so delicately, in his very own style, with fine nuances and a twinkle of humour in his eye.

It deals with real issues that people face. The characters are believable because they have flaws.  They've got inward struggles which makes this film even better.  It's a story of the human condition and how even deep prejudices can be overcome by the simple act of kindness and the willingness to strive for individuality.I have to admit the only reason I wanted to watch this movie at first was because of Johnny Depp.  I have to say I loved his performance as Roux.  I wished the writers would've done more with his character but what we did get to feast on was incredible.  Juliette Binoche was also incredible as Vianne and the chemistry between all the actors was great.I would recommend Chocolat.  If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?  It's great to see there are still film makers out there that have a sense of humanity.  Chocolat is all of that and more.Chocolat was indeed Mmmm, Mmmm, good!!

As the title would suggest it is a very sweet film, and not only for the gobs and gobs of luscious, mouthwatering, little morsels.  There are parts of the film that look like they could belong to a particularly delectable episode of `Martha Stewart Living', but if you can get past the pangs of hunger it will certainly inflict, you will find there is a lot more to this seemingly charming and simple story.The film plays in the style of all whimsical children's fairy tales, while at the same time blending in a series of very serious adult themes. It chronicles the exploits of single mother Vianne Rocher, played as usual to a wonderful effect by Juliette Binoche, and her sugary but confused 6-year-old daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), who blow in on a forceful winter wind to the small rural French town of Lansquenet-sous-Tannes. There they open a small chocolate shop.  Now this seems innocent enough but the people of the town have different views.  For one the shop has been opened at the very unwelcomed time of Lent (a religious fast), during which new temptations certainly aren't invited.  Secondly the town's new residents refuse to attend the Sunday morning worship service.  Vianne soon finds herself to be the center of the town gossip and distaste, led by the mayor (Alfred Molina).  The battle heats up between allegedly pagan Vianne, and the highly conservative, stuffed-shirt townspeople.  At start it seems the Rochers are losing, but the fight soon turns as the townsfolk begin to discover the mouth-melting effects of Vianne's wonderful taste-teasing treats.Misadventure after misadventure occur as the couple come in contact with a wide array of colorful characters (just when you think he must be an extra in comes Johnny Depp), solving their problems while at the same time selling their chocolates.  The moral is left fairly open, and can be interpreted in many ways.  My personal views are these  That to be good and righteous, doesn't mean you can't be different, you should accept everyone, not necessarily for who they are, but for what they are, human beings. Everyone deserves a proper chance.  In the end all characters  realize the error of their ways and live together happily and harmoniously.Chocolat has opened to mixed reviews.  Some critics find it to be overly simple, but I think that it is the movie's simplicity that drives it to become so charmingly enthralling.  Granted at times it does become at bit silly, but it all ends to a good warm effect.  Apparently the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences share my views as the film was nominated for five academy awards, Best Picture, Best Actress (Binoche), Best Supporting Actress (Judi Dench), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score.Chocolat is a mouthwatering piece of movie magic.  Definitely worth a look!  It has it's flaws but they are easily covered up by it's great performances (particularly by Binoche), beautiful scenery, giddy musical score, and delightful story.  Oh,&#133; and those wonderful chocolates.

In the mid &#145;50s, as if borne on the winds of fate, a somewhat mysterious woman arrives in a small town in France, with a young daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) in tow and a special talent that soon has the townsfolk in quite a stir.  Binoche is Vianne Rocher, a woman who uses her exotic recipe for chocolate to unlock the repressed sensibilities of the predominately Catholic citizenry, heretofore kept under the rigid and righteous thumb of the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), with no respite or help, even from the town's young and inexperienced priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor).  And because Vianne has the audacity to open her chocolate shop during Lent, when of course her sumptuous treats are forbidden, she quickly runs afoul of the Mayor and a battle of wills between the two ensues.  Her chocolates are irresistible, but the Mayor has tradition and religion on his side, and it puts the free-spirited Vianne-- who has something of the gypsy in her-- to the test. 	As a director, Hallstrom has just the right touch that brings out the best this story has to offer, which is to say, quite a bit.  It's an affecting and funny movie that will touch you emotionally as it involves you with the characters; Hallstrom knows what buttons to push and when, and it works splendidly.  There's a touch of mystery surrounding Vianne that underscores the sensitivity of the story, and Hallstrom never allows it to become maudlin, which successfully maintains the integrity of the drama.  And there are moments throughout the film that evoke an almost dream-like sense of pacification that draw you in as you indulge in the mouth watering visual pleasures of the chocolate.  Be forewarned, though, it's a tough one for diabetics to watch. 	What Hallstrom also has going for him in this one is an absolutely exquisite cast, many of whom give Oscar worthy, memorable performances, beginning with the superb Juliette Binoche.  There's an earthy, enigmatic and classic sense of beauty about her that make her presence on screen captivating; she's simply a joy to behold.  Judi Dench (Amande), meanwhile, does a terrific character turn as a mother whose daughter, Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), deems her an embarrassment and a bad influence on her son, Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koening), and Lena Olin (Josephine) is outstanding as well, as an unhappy woman who finds hope in Vianne's undaunted spirit.  Three extraordinary performances from gifted actresses that should be recognized with Oscar nominations.  And Molina, too, as the narrow minded Comte, gives possibly the best performance of his career, while Johnny Depp (Roux) lends some charm as the leader of a roving community of river people.   	Rounding out the supporting cast are John Wood (Guillaume), Peter Stormare (Serge) and Leslie Caron (Madame Audel).  Possibly the `sweetest' film of the year, as well as one of the best, `Chocolat' is a visual and emotional triumph that will warm your heart and make your taste buds salivate, with a story and characters as rich and satisfying as the candy they embrace.  It's a film with a human touch whose images and sensitivity will remain with you long after the screen has gone dark; an uplifting, entertaining movie that proves that the answers to the mysteries of life just may be found in that box of chocolates, after all.  I rate this one 10/10.

Vices make us complete human beings.  We can surpress them and deny them, but we can't quite run away from them.  Does it not strike you as a little humorous when someone looks at a menu, knows exactly what they want, but then decides not to get it for fear they will not only offend their God, but offend their own nature?  Lasse Hollstrom's latest film, Chocolat, knows all about that person.Juliette Binoche stars as Vianne Rosher, a chocolate shop owner who not only gets people to talk about their forbidden fruits, but also has the ability to make people happily indulge in them.  She, along with her daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol), moves into a quiet French village during Lent and opens her chocolate shop. The townspeople look in the window, admire the confections for a moment, then walk on by. One diabetic woman, Amande (Judi Dench), decides to stay for a little while.  Vianne puts a colorful ceramic plate on the table and spins it around.  She asks what Amande sees in the image. Amande tells her and Vianne presumes to know exactly what kind of confection Amande would like the best. We could only dream of such customer service this time of year.Amande's young grandson, Luc, an aspiring artist, also can't seem to stay away from the chocolate store, in spite of the wishes of his churchgoing mother (Carrie-Anne Moss).  Actually, the whole town goes to the same church and it doesn't take long before the Mayor (Alfred Molena) has his say against the shop, since many of the chocolates have been carved into the shapes of naked women and have names such as Nipples of Venus.  The chocolates also seem to be changing people's behavior.  A sexless, joyless married couple all of a sudden can't keep their Butterfingers off each other.The non-churchgoing Vianne eventually becomes the center of the town's controversy, but she soon has company after the arrival of the river rats, a group of Irish merchants who travel by boat to pawn off whatever they can, much to the dismay of the townspeople.  Here, Vianne meets Roux (Johnny Depp), and they become fast friends and, well, you know the rest.The story of Chocolat could be described in one sentence-Footloose, only instead of dancing, it's chocolates.  However, in this film we have some magic realism to deal with.  Unfortunately, the film does not quite develop its own `magical' ideas.  It gets bogged down by the usual story elements an d sub-plots we often see with this kind of story.  We get the battered wife who finds solace in Vianne's shop and we get the burning of a particular place (here, a boat) to further drive home the point that outsiders will not be tolerated.  I would have liked a little more `magic.'On the other hand, we do get some magic in the form of the performances. Juliette Binoche actually smiles and acts charming, as opposed to the sorrowful and pensive roles in which we usually see her.  What a relief to finally see her carrying a picture with warmth, confidence and wit, as well as beauty.  The guitar-twanging Johnny Depp (reuniting with his Gilbert Grape director), with a ponytail and an Irish accent, compliments her with a rugged look and easygoing charm that makes his fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants character a perfect soulmate for Binoche.I recommend stopping by the candy counter or sneaking in some Fannie May confections before the movie starts.  This film does for chocolate what Big Night did for Italian food. In spite of its flaws, Chocolat makes for a far more rewarding and satisfying film experience than Hollstrom's last feel-gooder, the over-rated Cider House Rules.  In the end, something about this film won me over.  It could have been the irrisistable theme of great food being as close to Godliness as one could get.  It could have been the sights of chocolates being created and turned into glorious, statuesque works of art.  It could have been the enjoyable cast, each member dealing with their hidden anguish and repression.  Or it could have been all of the above, combined with the captivating and alluring grace of Juliette Binoche.We all have our vices.

Well, when the movie started up, I got the main concept right away and was immediately interested, which they were very satisfactory at material like that, by that I mean, they weren't trying so hard to get the point through of what they wanted you to understand, they just followed the expression, go with the flow and that definitely worked out for the unquestionable better for this movie!I immediately fell in love with Juliette Binoche's character Vianne, because they do an excellent job at establishing her character to where you really care for her and admire her, same for many of the other main and supporting characters like Josephine, Armande and Roux. This movie had amazing character structure which in the end benefited it greatly, because that is one of the things I look for in every movie, that they are able to introduce their characters with strong, effective personalities and dispositions, you understand what they are basically like right away, and magnificently all the actors and actresses were able to do that with their characters, as I have already stated and praised a couple of times; Juliette Binoche deserved an Oscar, and Carrie-Ann Moss, Johnny Depp, Lena Olin, Judi Dench, Alfed Molina etc. etc. all gave astoundingly award-worthy performances as well!Second of all, the plot is absolutely miraculous. I couldn't help but be so mesmerized and entranced by how wonderfully they were able to create this strange, but lovable atmosphere of these people, not wanting to accept change to their quiet and cardboard little town, but then something so simple as chocolate is able to turn all their perspectives on life around all at once, which is a great and true message The simplest things sometimes can make the biggest impact, and this movie definitely showed that and handled the idea incredibly well.I love this movie, and the whole time I was watching, I had never wanted to consume chocolate so much in my life! I truly think it is really something special when a movie can just make the audience want to go out and do something or want to cooperate and or feel what the characters are feeling, and I mean that in a good sense of course, because the whole time I was watching this movie, I just wanted to experience these amazing experiences that the characters were experiencing and I even felt jealousy come over me as they obtained these opportunities!This film certainly is nowhere near bad and or mediocre in any way! It is a masterpiece! One of the best films I have ever seen, actually, no lie there! I didn't find one flaw, but it's just I do think it's one of those films where I believe there are overall a few better movies than it, and by that I mean, while this movie is breathtakingly stunning in it's whole trial, there are movies that I, surprisingly, do enjoy more. Regardless, Chocolat is a fun, beautifully crafted, completely alluring work of art from start to finish, and by the end I was astonished at how fantastic this movie really turned out to be.

With the arrival of some river drifters things become harder for Rocher especially as she tries to help some of the villagers who have been trapped behind the walls of respectability.With heaps of praise for this movie and the cast featuring the promise of the always interesting Johnny Depp, I took the chance to watch this film on television recently hoping for an enjoyable time. I did enjoy it but, aside from the sweet coating the film enjoys the film failed to have anything like a satisfying centre. The plot is fairly standard stuff where Vianne opens up the village to enjoy more about life and free them from restraint &#150; it doesn't have much in the way of surprises or depth to it and it is telling that an advert recently for butter has managed to tell the same story in about 30 seconds. However it is sweetly enjoyable anyway and I did find it to be quite charming in its own way &#150; only really towards the final third does the lack of depth really become exposed and the film doesn't leave any lasting impression other than a general sense of charm.Depp's involvement is a fine example of this &#150; he is prominent in all the marketing but really he just plays to his looks and his sexy presence without ever adding layers to his character (not his fault, but that of the script). Binoche is better and does try hard to make more of her character than just being all sweetness and light; likewise Moss, Stormare, Dench, Olin and Koenig all try hard to bring out complex characters and dark layers and they nearly succeed but the film seems more interested in being charming and sweet. Molina is very good until the ending forces him down an obvious path but until then he does tend to steal most of his scenes. Depp is very charming and a welcome addition despite representing the failings of the film.Direction is good and the film is charming but I didn't think this was enough. The plot goes just where you expect it to and asks too much of the audience to be won over by charm with no substance. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice film and was enough for me to enjoy in front of a nice coal fire on a cold night but by the end of the film I was left wishing it had managed to do more than just be nice.

Then along comes a woman who enters their world and turns it upside down by allowing them to experience life to the fullest after opening a chocolaterie. As the villagers become more and more tempted to visit her shop, she is able to open their eyes through her chocolate to a world completely different from what they know and trust. At the same time, Vianne, the owner of the chocolaterie, struggles with her own desires as she is forced to follow the North wind as her mother did. Only when she decides to allow her mother's spirit alone to move on, does she begin to experience her own happiness. The theme of the story is about love and the experiences of life even if we must go against the ways of tradition and the past. It's about finding out what makes us happy and working towards it while respecting others. The major characters include the mayor (Alfred Molina) of the village who is always trying to do what is right even though his own private world is that of despair. The conflict between him and Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is very evident. Then the character Roux (Johnny Depp) is considered a river rat by the villagers but ends up as Vianne's own personal piece of chocolate that opens her eyes to happiness. Josephine (Lena Olin) is another woman in the village whose husband, Serge (Peter Stormare), is very abusive and when given the opportunity to leave and begin working with Vianne, she jumps on it. Armande (Judi Dench) is the landlord of Chocolatery and is faced with a broken relationship with her daughter. Armande does what she wants and says what she wants and her witty comments immediately draw you in. This movie is much more than romance, it's magic through the guilty pleasures of chocolate. The actors and actresses make you feel like you are right there wanting to experience life as they wish to. The costumes and setting throughout the movie is beautiful and make a remarkable contribution to the movie. The setting is important to this movie because it helps you become drawn in like you are truly there in this small village. The village buildings are beautiful as well as many other locations throughout the movie. The costumes are important as everyone wears very dull colors while Vianne (the outsider) wears red heals and bright colors. The movie is a must see and is very entertaining.

The film is done well by Lasse Hallstrom but I don't think it's Oscar worthy. American Carrie Anne Moss also has a role playing Dench's daughter who forbids her son from knowing his grandmother. You can figure what happens.

After the initial introduction, the movie settled down into a pace where it quietly included past European and hence American superstitions and behaviors. Aristocracy and the hardships of labor are entwined with the love and devotion of family and friends. But not without a price. As the characters emerge you will fall for this romantic drama. This film requires no detailed knowledge of history or culture. A great film for family, dates, or just to be entertained but without the over the top explosions.

Alfred Molina has been one of my favorite actors, ever since I watched him in Not without my daughter with Sally Fields back in 1991.

Every single one of them is a star! Juliette Binoche is incredibly charming and her chemistry with Johnny Depp is as addictive as chocolate.The location is superb as it should, since it's a real village in the South of France, the music is beautiful and haunting at times, but not intrusive. The plot is good even if it's a bit predictable the priest under the thumbs of the mayor and all the town's prejudice, the grandmother who is forbidden to spend time with her grandson because of the daughter's insecurity, the battered wife, etc, etc. But it all works out very nicely in the end with the town finally accepting the atheist lady and her perverse sweets, the return of the hunk, aka Johnny Depp and the wind, which is another caractor in the story... in other words, all lived happily ever after!

In a sense, the story is a fairy tale about a good witch who turns a town upside down mainly due to the villagers' fear and ignorance, and does good for them despite themselves. Beautifully shot, wonderfully written, and delightfully acted, the film is as near perfection among romantic comedy-dramas as I have seen in a long time. Binoche is most fetching, Olin fine as a battered wife who blooms (it is magical just for a film buff to contemplate how the actresses and their roles have changed since they were together in The Unbearable Lightness of Being), Molina a wonderful villain, and Judi Dench as a crusty diabetic landlady somehow made me cry nearly every time she came on screen.

This does not bode well with the Mayor (Alfred Molina) who fancies himself something of a dictator - he wants to tell you how to live and how to feel and even has so much of an influence in church that the young priest often has to be edited on the pulpit by him.Aside from the Mayor, Vienne has an effect on several townspeople, most notably Judi Dench, from whom she is renting the space.

Also, an abused woman named Josephine, is inspired by Vienne's spirit to leave her husband (Peter Stormare) but is seen in bad light since she is forgetting about her marriage vows.  Josephine works at the shop and is soon an independent person.  Binoche and Dench certainly deserved their Oscar nominations, but Lena Olin as Josephine should have received one, too.

I am not a Christian, nor am I a big fan of Christianity, but I felt for them in this film because they were given little to no respect. We as the audience see the Christian characters as stupid, dull and short-tempered. Juliette Binoche's character, however, is righteous and the movie makes absolutely NO attempt to delve into her philosophy. We are supposed to accept that she is simply right and the townspeople are sleepwalking, only to be awakened by the vessel of her enlightening chocolat.Once again in a Hollywood film, Christians are characters who are single-minded and convenient foils for the open-minded and therefore correct heroes of the film. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that either side is right, but the filmmakers don't give the traditional Christians even a voice of respect and then slap them in the face by having the Christian priest speak about how he felt they should forget about the divinity of Christ and regale in his humanity.

The movie also has sidebar stories of spousal abuse, difficult parent-child relationships, and romance. The movie has some quirky humour that brings comic relief to the misfortunes. The cast is outstanding with Juliette Binoche, the village's recently arrived chocolatier; Johnny Depp, as Roux another newcomer; and Judy Dench, as the free spirited grandmother who has been ostracized by the village and her own daughter. Leslie Caron has a minor role as one of three widows. Juliette Binoche plays a very warm and somewhat unconventional young woman who takes over a patisserie where she sets up a chocolate shop with flavours that disarm and delight everyone who tastes them. However, the village is not about to embrace the new entrepreneur; the village mayor dislikes anyone who threatens his petty tyranny and this includes the new chocolatier and Johnny Depp's group of merrymaking gypsies. When the small town bigotry turns violent, the village priest, a mere lad, finally breaks from the mayor's rigid code of morality that he has been all too willing to follow. Eventually the two sides in this battle collide. In the end, the chocolate becomes a decisive weapon in the village war. When the dust settles, the viewer can feel a sense of satisfaction in this well paced and thoroughly entertaining movie.

You don't know if this is going to be comical, which you would expect when you see all the devoted silly faces in Sunday church, or if it is a documentary about cocoa since the narrator takes you to South America where Vianne's father apparently got sexually stimulated after drinking hot chocolate. Or did he just got excited by the hot Amazonian girls by the campfire? Anyway, in the end it is just going to be a fairytale with a grouchy grandmother played by Judi Dench, that despite her grade one diabetes indulges herself in chocolate. A village Mayor (Alferd Molina) who is estranged from his wife for over six months and thinks that chocolate is going to give him the desired satisfaction he lacks since. He looks more like a Mr. Cluso when he rolls in to the Chocolatery and gives a boring performance of how not to eat truffles. What is the conspiracy behind here? Tobacco companies cannot buy into the movie scene anymore and now we are looking at Cadbury's or Droste to sell us more than chocolate actually can deliver? In the old days, mankind might have given chocolate some hallucinogenic powers and it does enhances mood in some people and for that matter it took time to get accepted. Similarly today with hemp, all sort of powers and qualities are given to the weed and in 5 or 10 years people will laugh as to how innocent hemp really is and accepted like Chocolat.

Causing the same release of chemicals as sexual gratification, the cocoa bean has been eaten with desirable results for centuries. Joanne Harris' novel about a woman who revolutionises a French town through chocolate is obviously aware of this and thankfully the film adaptation keeps this in mind. Well acted and with a wide range of enigmatic characters, the film is a feel good story which (just like chocolate itself) leaves you both happy and desperate for more.A small French village, led by the Comte De Reynaud (Alfred Molina), is a place of contained misery. A group of people who keep their emotions and feelings bottled up and reject all gratification in favour religious purity, things need to change. So when the mysterious Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) turn up and create the ultimate temptation in the form of life altering chocolate, the Comte is less than overjoyed.There's this strange feeling that one gets as they watch Chocolat. Certain films induce desires of one extreme or the other. If you watch a romance, you will probably feel the desire for love. If you watch a particularly violent movie, you'll find yourself with a desire to attack someone (this is a desire rather than a necessity of course and not something to be acted upon). So when you watch Chocolat you find yourself with this enormous, obvious desire to pig out through a box of fancy chocolates. Not necessarily Cadbury or another ordinary selection, but something fancy.The chocolate lust induced leads to one conclusion. Irrelevant of whether you love the plot or not, the way the film shows chocolate as a thick beautiful fluid is magnificent. Similar to cooks like Floyd, Rhodes, Smith and others, the film shows you how well the food can be good and by the end you are literally drooling.At the other end of the scale, if you don't find yourself drooling over the chocolate, you can always drool over Juliette Binoche. Not a personal favourite when it comes to acting, Binoche turns in a suitably brilliant performance here. Showing a woman who feels obligated to move on when the time is right (a novel comparison with the villagers and their own personal sacrifices), Binoche adds a reality to a character who must not have been easy to portray. At the same time though, she also adds a remarkable air of sexuality to an almost mother like role. She might be aided by magnificent performances from a cast including Molina, Dame Judi Dench and Johnny Depp, but it is Binoche who is deservedly named first. She is a majestic lead and the film is better for her presence.If there is any complaint to be made of Chocolat it is that the script begins badly. Adapted from the book by Robert Nelson Jacobs, the general layout of the story flows remarkably well. In the first thirty minutes or so however, the lines don't work particularly well and you find yourself grimacing at times. Jacobs does improve, like the film in general, as the story progresses, but by this time it would not be surprising if some had turned the film off.Despite the disappointing beginning, Chocolat is a film worth watching. Brilliantly acted and often beautiful to watch, it is an entertaining piece which will leave you with a huge grin and a feeling of well being. Like chocolate itself, you can't help but feel that life is better with Chocolat around.

Nominated for five Oscars, one would think it dwells in intellectual territory, but Chocolat comes from the heart -- and possibly the stomach. The Cider House Rules director Lasse Hallstrom sees these charms and wisely makes them the focal point of this likable film.Juliette Binoche stars as a mysterious but likable woman name Vianne who comes to a small, bland and morally rigid French town run by the Catholic church and opens a chocolate shop with her imaginative young daughter. We know only that the wind brought her to this town -- her past remains a mystery, which creates that slightly magical tall tale effect. Within the first fifteen minutes her shop is open for business and she's successfully predicting what each customer's favorite treat will be. Binoche exudes the charm the role requires but never sacrifices sophistication despite not having a clearly established back story.On the opposite end of the spectrum sits Alfred Molina as Comte de Reynaud, the moral authority figure who immediately sees Vianne's shop as an affront to his town and its Catholic principles. Cold on the outside but clearly soft on the inside, of all the Oscar nominations, somehow Molina's performance -- in my opinion the film's best -- was overlooked.Vianne's chocolate creates quite the stir, improving one couple's love life, inspiring a wife (Lena Olin) to leave her abusive husband and reuniting a old woman (Judi Dench) with her grandson. In a more serious film, this would all seem quite convenient and unlikely, but few viewers will fail to notice that chocolate is a metaphor here for something bigger. It embodies that blurred line between what is temptation and what is healthy possibility. That metaphor provides a strong moral fiber for Chocolat which turns out to be what makes it a fine film. It has a tendency to dull a bit in the middle and the entrance of Johnny Depp late into the run time despite his high billing confuses more than helps the story, but overall Chocolat is rich in its simplicity. When the young priest, Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor) delivers the closing words of the film at Easter Mass after appearing as a peculiar and weak character throughout, the story's message becomes abundantly clear and the intention and wisdom of the film shine through.Chocolat could easily be construed as critical of organized religion, Catholicism in particular, but Pere Henri's speech beautifully connects the film's call for embracing life with Christian philosophy. It's a timeless message with timeless components, but the unique premise and setting make Chcolat a fresh tale of great wisdom.~Steven CVisit my site http//moviemusereviews.com "},{"Title":"Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp are wonderful","Date":"10 July 2009","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" This film is one of those that you can watch many times and still find delight in.

The most wonderful thing about this movie has to be the cast, headed by the beautiful Frenchwoman Juliette Binoche as Vianne, a nomad who travels with her daughter and sets up shop in a tiny French village. She is somewhat of a rebel, who doesn't go to church and believes in giving into the desires an passions most people restrict, especially during the holy time of Lent. As Vianne tries to survive the tense and strict society in which she dwells, she comes across various people all with different desires and pleasures, including Judi Dench as a bitter old woman, Carrie-Ann Moss as a strict and upright mother and Lena Olin as a wife with an unsteady home life.All changes for Vianne when Roux,a handsome riverboat wanderer played by Johnny Depp shows up on the shore. He is more of a nomad than she and he inflicts in her desires she never thought she had and soon is beginning to get a taste of her own medicine. Despite this rather stocky and formulaic plot line, the movie is quite enjoyable though not completely satisfying. It dances with ideas about forgetting your moral conscience and giving into every desire, which I am sure cannot be helpful to anyone. Perhaps I am misjudging it, but it seems almost as if the movie is more interested in simply showing the power of the chocolate than the actual process involved in making a change in your life. It does have elements of fantasy, which I don't mind, but I find it hard to mix fantasy with reality and make it work all the way.Despite its shortcomings, this is a sweet and spicy delight with a top-notch cast, some gorgeous sets and costumes, and some interesting twist on chocolate recipes.

Juliette Binoche arrives in a small French village, young daughter in tow, and proceeds to turn a local patisserie into a store devoted exclusively to chocolates of all tastes and varieties. Causing quite a stir amongst the restrained locals (especially as the store is officially opened during the time of Lent), she struggles to make friends and fight against the stifling moral strait-jackets that everyone appears to have been placed in (all thanks to the mayor, played by Alfred Molina). Some people do end up lending their support but they are all outsiders in their own way; a curmudgeonly grandmother (Judi Dench), an abused and put-upon wife (Lena Olin) and a river rat (Johnny Depp, complete with a terrible accent). The next time the North wind blows will it be time for the new arrivals to move on or will they help the town actually enjoy facets of life.With only a few moments of actual seriousness throughout (one fire scene and one particular scene involving an outburst from Peter Stormare as he tries to reclaim the wife he inflicts violence upon) this is, for the most part, a light and palatable confection. Yes, it is making points about the way we need to sometimes just stop and enjoy life and what we have, it's making points about tolerating differences in others and it's . . . . . it's . . . . . it's actually busy making you lick your lips as you watch chocolate after chocolate being served up to the right customer.Hallström beautifully sets things up and then simply lets them work from A to B so that we are presented with little more than an endearing fairy tale for those old enough to tuck themselves into bed at nights.

This film has a lovely tone and message to it, which it delivers beautifully, and Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp make the most gorgeous couple I've ever seen. The only downside? What with the chocolate and the enormous feast that is cooked up in the film, it always makes me hungry when I watch it, and dying to cook. A real delicacy.

Into a very conservative and self-satisfied town comes a strange Bohemian lady and her young daughter to open a chocolate shop. The fact that the child has no father and the shop opens during Lent sends some of the townspeople into a tizzy--particularly the Mayor who is like a human version of Sam the Eagle from the Muppet Show--both in looks and attitude. Despite the concerted efforts of many to drive her out of business, the lady's business survives--thanks to candy that seems to work magic on those who consume it. Later, a group of Gypsies arrive and for once, they are the most hated residents of the town--not the Chocolatier. How all this anger and animosity is worked out is something you'll just need to see for yourself.Now some might watch this film and assume it is an attack on religion--it sure looks that way through much of the film. On one hand, you have the Chocatier who is good and never goes to church and on the other you have church goers who are all hypocrites. However, please DON'T give up on the film, as you later see that the lady does NOT have all the answers and the film is not an attack on religion, per se, but an attack on those who have a dogmatic devotion to rules and thereby ignore the spirit of Christianity. In many ways the film reminds me of ANTONIA (Best Foreign Picture Winner, 1995) except that unlike ANTONIA, this film is NOT meant as an angry attack on religion and seems less rabidly feminist. Both films actually have a very similar message, but CHOCOLAT is much more subtle and less angry--meaning it's a film that can be appreciated by most anyone regardless of their political or religious persuasion--especially since the film seems to call for religious reform not the elimination of religion altogether.Also, oddly, the film reminded me quite a bit of another Dutch film, JA ZUSTER, NEE ZUSTER (Yes Sister, No Sister). Both feature a nice leading lady and her small group of friends who are constantly attacked by a very conservative and fun-hating neighbor who eventually comes to accept them in the end.About the only serious negative in the film is Johnny Depp's character. He looks scruffy--just like Depp looks in real life. Considering this film was set in 1960, he really is an anachronism--being a 21st century hippie-like character plopped down in the early 1960s. His character just didn't make a lot of sense.Regardless, this is a fun and highly entertaining film. Aside from a couple tiny scenes that make the film inappropriate for young kids, this is a film you can let your kids see (making it quite unlike ANTONIA).

The movie doesn't solely focus on the problems the woman (well played by Juliette Binoche) is having with her chocolate shop, but also with the town's mayor, an abusive husband, a woman's relationship with her mother, and a band of gypsies that come passing through. All of these unconnected events are inextricably linked through the chocolate shop that opens in the town. I like how well the movie flows with a nice blend of comedy and drama. Surprisingly, one of the most engaging things in the film is the woman's daughter's relationship with her imaginary friend, an injured kangaroo. My favourite character though is Roux, the gypsy that befriends the woman.Everyone in the movie does a really good job in their roles. I could watch Johnny Depp sleeping and still enjoy his performance, so I naturally liked him in this movie. I found Alfred Molina pretty funny as the mayor of the town.

But the well casted Binoche steals the show with her French savoir-faire on the subtleties of yearning and seduction.Not seduction in a Sharon Stone way, A Kim Basinger or even a Jennifer Lopez way, but one that makes her a true believable girl next door, while still keeping that enigmatic secret, that every nomad seems to have.While we must not forget the nice performance of the supporting actors (of which Alfred Molina and Judi Dench stand out), it is Binoche that shows how to incorporate a romantic story with a deeper layer, without getting corny or boring, although we all know where it's gonna end.And that's where romantic films need to score on a niche in the thematic material, or the characters of the romance, who want to be followed through their hurdles-taking.Chocolat succeeds handsomely with this, which makes it recommended not only for enamored couples of any age, but of everyone who wants a taste of what gives people their energy in struggling for a place of their own.

A woman and her daughter travel from town to town opening up chocolate shops and invite bystanders to lavishes the taste. Why her chocolates have romantic affects on people is unexplained but the film is visually crafted. Directed by Lasse Hallestrom with disjointed structure and full of clichés but it is a big improvement over the overrated snore fest The Cider House Rules. Despite the lack of background and explanation Juliette Binoche is sunny and pleasant. Judi Dench steals scenes as an elderly woman with diabetes who is smitten by her daughter due to her lifestyle. Lena Olin plays the victim of spousal abuse who finds refuge in the company of this mysterious woman. Alfred Molina debates against Binoche, which leads to conviction when he wakes up in the wrong place at the right time. Johnny Depp is featured as a drifter who gets romantically involved with Binoche, but his role and this subplot is utterly pointless and distracting. None of the subplots are solid due to bad structuring but the cast play off the fantasy level to great payoff. It contains elements of romance but in conjunction with tremendous visual fantasy in appearance. Theme regards acceptance that is as inviting as chocolate to taste buds.

Being passionate about (good) food, give me a decent plot with lots of gorgeous food and it will be good in my book. But Lasse Halstrom's little confection is beyond that, still. A story of Vianne(Juliette Binoche), a single mother who moves into a quiet little French town with her daughter and opens a chocolaterie during lent upsetting the spirits in the otherwise peaceful and pious community by bringing a breeze of something different and delicious into the lives of the locals, also solving some of their problems along the way, like wife abuse, mother- daughter issues and elderly romance. However, Vianne finds her nemesis in Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), the town's major who's determined to keep his community devote and away from Vianne's sinfully delicious temptations. When the river rats, headed by Roux(Johnny Depp) come along,the situation reaches its boiling point. Let's start with the (numerous) good sides of the film. The cinematography is amazing, the little town looks like it's enchanted, and Rachel Portman's wonderful soundtrack certainly supports the impression. The cast is equally impressive Judy Dench, Juliette Binoche, Lena Olin, Afred Molina and Johnny Depp add considerable wattage to the story. Especially the delicate Binoche, who succeeds in making Vianne very life-like and sympathetic. Dench's sarcastic grandmother provides a great contrast to her boring daughter(Carrie- Ann Moss). The scene with the poetry book is almost equally Oscar-worthy as her famous too late from Shakespeare in Love. As for the weak sides of the film, the characters are structured in a very flat, b/w sort of way, and it seems their only function is embodying stereotypes (the conservative mayor, the free-thinking confectioner, the cynical old lady)and provide contrasts to each other. Do make sure you have a substantial amount of chocolate pralines while watching, otherwise it will feel like the confectionery equivalent of water-boarding. I could watch this all over again.

Perhaps the most gifted director working today, Hallstrom was probably the only one who could have made this tale of a Mary Poppinseque chocolate maker a masterpiece.An exquisite piece of work, Chocolat delvers a strong message in just 121 minutes (It seems shorter.) with Hallstrom's velvet glove preventing the points he makes from stinging too badly.LIKELY SPOILERS AHEADSet in a quaint French village in 1959, a universe away from the worldly French big city life going on around it, the film begins with strong overtones of Mary Poppins. A `clever North wind' blows in not an umbrella-wielding nanny, but a chocolate-baking single mother and her young daughter. We later learn that the woman, Vianne (Binochet) hails from a long line of drifting Mayan women who dispense health and happiness through ancient magical recipes.Just like in the earlier children's movie, the North wind blows her into a fussy locale, badly in need of a breath of fresh air-and a taste of chocolate.  The village is a small, close-knit community where tradition is paramount-along with the leadership of the Catholic Church and the elected officials. Monsieur Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) is mayor of the small town and is descended from the first Comte (count) de Reynaud, whose statue stands outside the church in the center of town. He takes it upon himself to rewrite sermons for youthful priest Pere Henri (Hugh O'Conor), to spread gossip and to keep unsavory elements out of town. He leads by example, fasting throughout Lint.The Comte meets his match in the strong-willed Vianne, however, as she dares open a chocolate shop during the beginning of Lint. Parishioners in this tiny village do not choose one negligible habit to dispense with during Linten season; they are expected to be abstinent even in marriage and to avoid all sweets and other forms of pleasure. As outcast villager Josephine Muscat (Lena Olin) says, those who misbehave or who fail to fit the narrowly defined roles within the community are termed `crazy' or forced out. Josephine and elderly Armande Voizin (Dame Judi Dench) are both outcasts who are reassured by the suave, confident chocolate maker. When swashbuckling river drifter Roux (Johnny Depp) and his band show up, it is more than the Comte can stand and the battle lines are finally drawn.The plot has no real surprises, yet never drags. Hallstrom weaves his spell, with just a touch of mystical magic, as that old North wind blows in from time to time and stirs things up in the tiny town. The village itself is wonderful-both in the aerial shots (models, I assume) and closer views. Looking back, I cannot remember seeing an automobile, a few of which I assume would have been seen in even the most modest village in 1959. Still, it is a most charming setting and it works quite well. Even the first Comte's statue comes into play more than once.The cast is superb. I was only familiar with Dench and Depp, prior to seeing the film. Everyone shines, though. Binochet rules the roost with a strong, appealing and very human portrayal of the sometimes-mystical sometimes-vulnerable Vianne. Strikingly attractive, her looks and tempting sweets are too much for the provincial natives. Molina is wonderful as the overbearing Comte. Every church has an elder/deacon like this. A good man at heart, he fights to suppress his own desires and heartache and expects the others to emulate his example. The protection of his idyllic village is his overriding priority. While pushy and presumptuous, Molina never crosses the line and becomes a cardboard villain.Of course it goes without saying that Dench is superb. (When has she NOT been?) As the elderly, worn-out landlady, she sparkles with her usual strength, grit and charm. She and Binochet are marvelous together. She also shines with her artistic grandson Luc, played splendidly by Aurelien Parent-Koenig.Olin makes a wonderful transformation as Josephine and delivers one of the best lines of the movie. Her drunken husband Serge (Peter Stormare) had roared, `You don't even know how to use a skillet!' while breaking into the chocolate shop to take her home. After conking him on the head with a frying pan, she proclaimed, `Who says I don't know how to use a skillet?' Depp also does good work and provides fine romantic tension with Binochet. John Wood and Leslie Caron also make a charming couple, who Vianne brings together in their twilight years. O'Conor, meanwhile, is likeable as the earnest, but inexperienced priest. A fan of American rock & roll music, despite himself, he nevertheless takes his vows seriously. He sternly lectures Wood for having prayed for God to soothe his ailing 14-year-old dog's spirit. When Wood blithely outmaneuvers him, he quickly slams the confessional door.Perhaps my favorite Hallstrom moment is when the prim and proper widow Madame Audel sneaks a piece of candy during Mass. The crinkling of the wrapper catches many ears-especially those of the Comte, who gives her an icy stair. The camera then catches her-cool as a cucumber-innocently swallow her candy.Of course it is not hard to predict the moral that will be learned by the priest, the Comte and his stunningly attractive secretary (Carrie-Anne Moss). This hardly matters, as Hallstrom and his cast and crew's execution are virtually seamless. To paraphrase the Christopher Reeves `Superman' promos, `You will BELIEVE that a magical chocolate recipe can change lives!' Hallstrom has a way of making a believer out of us.

CHOCOLAT has a very subtle attitude about itself and it shows throughout the movie when each character grows. The movie has a sweet nature as well and we are not talking about anything overly hokey.Lent has arrived in the small French town of Lansquenet. A mother and daughter also arrive too. They set up a chocolate store and captivate nearly everyone since trying something new is a rarity.Predictable, CHOCOLAT demonstrates the people's desires, bringing out the best in them. Everything that was once behind closed doors is now an open book. The reason chocolate! For that reason, it makes CHOCOLAT all the more humorous and enjoyable. Some good dialogue stretch out this overlong movie and provides some good entertainment. Things may have constantly changed Lansquenet when it arrived, but CHOCOLAT the movie is a good looking chick flick.

Add a dash of Oscar-nominated director (Lasse Holmstrom), Oscar-nominated lead actress (Juliette Binoche), Oscar-winning supporting actress (Judi Dench), and Oscar-worthy cast members Alfred Molina and Johnny Depp, splash in a small village in the French countryside, and top it off with a novel-turned-script that is pitch perfect.  Add it all together, and what do you have for the final product?An absolutely wonderful ensemble production.Chocolat is a well-conceived tale, almost a fable, about a vibrant, free-spirited woman and her daughter who have made a life of traveling from town to town, opening their chocolate parlors and stirring the pot of very traditional townsfolks' ways of life.The impetus for the changes and stirrings that inevitably occur are Vianne's chocolate delicacies, which represent for these God-fearing folk a sense of decadence some of them have never felt in their lives.  Inspiration to follow their passions ensues, and a grand mix of comedy and romance is the ticket to a tremendously entertaining film.Guaranteed, you will feel good after seeing Chocolat.  And you'll probably find yourself heading down to the corner store, stocking your shelves with sweets of your own.  Don't worry.  It'll be worth it.

It is a story of many layers that appears to be one flavor on the outside, but changes as the confection dissolves in our psyche.  On its face, it is a story about an endless drifter named Vianne (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter Anouk, who take up residence in a small French town in the 1950's and open a Chocolate shop right in the middle of Lent.  However, once the initial layer melts away we realize that this is not a story about Vianne, but really a story about the town and its people.Vianne is more of a catalyst to the stories around her than a story unto herself.  Ironically, Binoche is a lead actor in a supporting role despite having the camera on her most of the time.  If there is one consistent theme that runs through the film it is one of reconciliation.  Prior to Vianne's arrival, several of the townspeople had survived in a kind of stasis, with unresolved issues never addressed or confronted.  Vianne is the straw that stirs the drink and brings various issues into the open to be examined and resolved.The film has a strong feminist subtext, which is not objectionable by itself, but too often becomes strident and preachy.  Of greater value is the subtle message that provincial ignorance is well served by exposure to new and non-conforming ideas (Vianne and Roux) and that the forces that promote ignorance and conformity out of fear change (Comte de Reynaud) are no match for the power of knowledge and the freedom to exercise it.  In this way, the film is very uplifting and relevant despite its folksy telling.As he did with `The Cider House Rules', Lasse Hallstrom lets the story dominate the screen, bringing us well developed character studies without excessive directorial stylizing.  Hallstrom's strength lies in character interpretation and in guiding the actors to broaden and deepen their portrayals.  This is clearly evident here.Juliette Binoche gives a wonderful performance that earned her a best actress nomination from the Academy.  Judy Dench continues to make great acting a routine, garnering her third best supporting actress nomination for her role.  Lena Olin gives a standout performance as the battered wife struggling to regain her self esteem.  Alfred Molina is also excellent as the oppressive mayor trying to pull the strings of the townspeople in a desperate attempt to maintain the status quo.This is a terrific film with numerous thought provoking subthemes.  While it is not a powerful film, it is a substantial film.  I rated it 9/10.  It is a delight for the thoughtful and intelligent viewer who enjoys a well developed human drama.

This film is an allegory for intellectual and political repression of all kinds and shows how easily people can be set against their true nature by a clever propagandist.Thus, the bogeyman is not the right or the left, but the self enslavement of minds against tolerance.Once you concentrate on that theme, superbly expressed, the minor implausibilities become trivial.In our time, the intolerance is called Political Correctness. "},{"Title":"Interpretation Zen and the Art of Chocolat","Date":"3 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" Desire naturally brings change.  It's never really satisfied, it never settles down for very long.We see it personified in Anouk and her mother Vianne, always moving from home to home.  Everyone in the town is supposed to repudiate desire for Lent, but the conscious effort is artificial, and it's no match for temptation.  Vianne can guess everybody's favorite.  Except for Roux.Roux is always on the move too, but he takes his home with him.  (Note that roux is a shade of red, and Anouk and her mother wear red when arriving and leaving.)  But unlike Anouk and her mother, Roux doesn't try to judge his destiny or alter it; he simply adapts to it.  Here the river is used as a common metaphor for the inexorable flow of the Tao.  And when Roux's boat docks, we begin to see the fusion of eastern and western thought.It begins with Luc's grandmother.  She loves chocolate in spite of its effect on her health, denouncing quiet capitulation as worse than hell. Ultimately, she only finds happiness through acceptance, through adaptation. But ask yourself, what is the fundamental difference between adaptation and capitulation?  Either way you can't change your fate.I believe the difference is ego.  When she tells Vianne, Don't you dare pity me, she reveals she no longer thinks of herself as a victim isolated from the world around her.  She has let go of the ego-driven notion of a separate self.  And when that happens, there's no one to feel sorry for. In fact, there's nothing left to do but live in the present moment, and enjoy the sweet taste of chocolate.Vianne is also changing.  After the river party, she confides to Roux that she and Anouk hate constantly moving around.  She's discovered that experience isn't necessarily better than innocence, but how do you go back? Roux knows, but doesn't say.Original innocence never lasts forever.  In fact, Serge and Josephine illustrate the inevitable schism between blind faith and free will.  The funny thing is, God doesn't realize what's going on.  (If they're still married in the eyes of God, Josephine argues, then God must be blind.) Serge's fate presents us with the highly amusing thesis that obedience, not temptation, is the source of original sin.  When God discovers that Serge's obedience caused him to burn Roux's ship, he awakens to human nature, realizing that innocence is not the same thing as righteousness.  The count evicts him from the village, but it's too late.  Choice is necessary to demonstrate good character.Notice that the count is not merely an authority; he is in fact God himself, on a journey from justice to mercy.  (There's a recurring color theme to signify transformation the river is blue-green, the walls of the chocolaterie are brilliant turquoise, and the statue of the original Count of Reynaud is patinated copper.)  Chocolat depicts an imperfect God evolving with man as he begins to understand desire.Desire feels innate, but Zen suggests judgements and preferences are a product of the ego, and that they disappear when you reclaim your original mind.  We see this happen with Anouk's friend Pantoufle.  In French, the word pantoufle has a slang meaning a high-level administrator who leaves his post.  For Anouk, he represents the uppermost level of human intelligence -- the conscious self.  Pantoufle is of course imaginary, but she believes he's real.  Notice that when Roux returns to stay, Pantoufle vanishes.Her mother wasn't sorry to see him go.  After all, the ego is the source of anger, envy, and human suffering.  And when it disappears, it naturally brings peace.  Christianity calls it salvation; Buddhism calls it enlightenment.  It's at this point that Vianne finally guesses Roux's favorite ordinary hot chocolate.  And she does it without trying.As much as you enjoy temptation, don't you wish you could trade your experience for innocence again?

Most of the actors portray their roles very well, particularly Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, the travelling chocotherapist, and Alfred Molina as the Comte, the mayor who puts personal pride above public honour.  Johnny Depp wasn't up to much, and his false Irish accent wasn't very authentic.  One might wonder if Depp's role had only been created in order to attract his fanclub.Like 'Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory', the storyline is as simple or as complex as you want.  It can be taken at the level of a tale about the temptations of chocolate, or it can be seen as one woman's mission to heal people of their prejudices and hidden immoralities.  In this sense Binoche's character is almost Christlike, providing refuge for the oppressed, challenging the traditional authorities, and eating with 'sinners' (the river itinerants).  She also admits her own faults too.If so wished, the film gently coaxes the viewer to think about how members of society treat one another.  No definitive message is cast; it is up to one's own interpretation.'Chocolat' is one of those feelgood films, the kind you come out of thinking of how much you enjoyed the show.  Yet it could change your perspective on life.Just one thing though  with Binoche and Lena Olin eating so much chocolate, how come they stayed so thin?  Must be the Mayan metabolism!

Here she gives a fine performance as the rebellious shop owner who comes to town. The only thing I can criticise is her relationship with Johnny Depp &#150; I don't think there is a lot of chemistry between them. In fact, Depp seems to be a little bit miscast here, coming across as a nineties rock star rather than a fifties Irish tinker. In contrast, her relationship with Lena Olin is excellent and they almost recreate the magic of The unbearable lightness of being in which they both starred. I suppose Judy Dench deserved her oscar nomination and Alfred Molina shows that he is an under-rated actor.The settings and the cinematography are lush and beautiful and enhance the fairytale theme of the story. And the direction cannot be faulted. So why, given all these pluses, did I find this movie just `OK'? It could be that I find the premise of somebody opening up a cholaterie causing so much uproar as implausible. Chocolate is treated as an elusive drug &#150; we all now it's nice, but can it really cause such a reaction in the townspeople, especially when just down the road they are making merry in a bar on alcohol. There is no real drama, and when it does occur it is toned down as if not to interfere with the slow-paced nature of the film. It seems that the screenplay was written by a nice middle aged lady for nice middle-class people &#150; refusing to take into account a modern audiences demand for something more cutting edge.

This is a gorgeous film to watch but I really feel it is of limited appeal. Juliette Binche looks great as always and Johnny Depp has never looked better. I would rather have seen Judi Dench win the Oscar for her performance here than for the six minutes she did in Shakespeare in Love I had a strange feeling of deja vu watching the scenes between Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin. They were last together in 'The Unbearable Likeness of Being' which is one of my favourite films. It was like watching Sabina and Tereza 15 years on ! For those of you who thought like my husband that Lena Olin disappeared after The Unbearable ... she didnt - its just that the films she's made since havent been particularly 'mainstream' .... I'm actually very pleased and surprised that Chocolat was considered suitable for general release !

The town is extremely conservative headed by a sucpicious mayor who is not to fond of this new person.  For she does not go to church, and even has the nerve to open up a shop during lent, and not just any shop... a CHOCOLATE shop..  sin of sins..As the locals one by one find out more about the shop, Binoche's character plays the temptress by awakening their hidden desires with the delictable sweets she makes up.  The story has that very once upon a time feel, and it centres on the plot that Binoche and her daughter keep moving from town to town (cause her shop is to radical for the conservative rurals) as she is never accepted, and some side plots involving an old woman who doesn't get to see her grandson from her  possesive daughter, and another woman who after visiting the shop attempts to leave her abusive husband and change her life by working in the store.I was quite surprised with this film.  I didn't expect much but it is actually pretty good.  It could have been better with a more fluid story and some more interesting characters and performances.  The performances of the grandmother (Judi Dench) and Juliette Binoche as the chocolatier are very good, and the food shots are great which certainly make the picture even better (love those food movies).Sinfully delightful!!!

A lovely array of chocolate displays bombarded me for almost two hours, tempting me with their beauty and their promises to satisfy my cravings.  Seeing all of those truffles, creams, and exotic blends of all sorts made my current diet all the more tortuous.  It seriously put me in the mood for a sinful truffle or two, right when I needed them the least.As for the film itself, it works a special charm usually reserved for the most cherished of fairy tales.  The underlying magic, the strong but all-too-human heroine, and the beautiful ensemble of characters all come together to make one of the finest movies of 2000.  The ending works against that magical feel, in ways that I can not explain without making a spoiler, however that is a minor complaint.It even was enough to make me shed a tear (or a few) at parts.  Yes, it really IS that great of a movie.This movie is truly as delicate, as beautiful, and as sweet as all of the chocolates that it displays.  Highly recommended.9 out of 10.

She rents a patisserie shop from an aged owner, Armande Voizin(Judi Dench), and quickly rehabilitates it into the chocolate shop of the title.  Her magical gifts at creating these sweet wonders and also anticipating the exact delight of each of her prospective clients comes from her own mother, a Mayan priestess with whom her father had had a doomed relationship.  Unfortunately, all of this activity takes place right at the start of Lent in this heavily Catholic town under both the political and the moral guidance of the Mayor Comte de Reynaud(Alfred Molina). The mayor is also currently occupied in the training of the newly-arrived priest so as to elevate him to his own exacting moralistic standards.The Mayor takes it as a personal affront that this young woman has opened this shop of gustatory pleasures during the Lenten period when fasting and denying yourself of all earthly pleasures is supposed to be the rule. He threatens to close her down before the end of Lent.  The few allies Vianne finds in the town include her landlady and also a battered wife, Josephine Muscat(Lena Olin).  This situation quickly develops into a crisis setting when a boatload of musical drifters headed by Roux(Johnny Depp) drop achor in the river that flows through the town.  The two non-comformists quickly link up as allies while the Mayor and his allies try to figure out how to get this new threat of the floating riff-raff back on their boat and off to the next town as soon as possible.While I am a sucker for ancient European villages and all period romances, this story didn't develop either the romance or the story to levels raised by all the Oscar hoopla.  Neither the movie nor Juliette Binoche nor Judi Dench deserved their Oscar nominations.  Binoche's's character was not fleshed out enough to allow us to get to know what really motivated her.  Furthermore, while the shop is proclaimed to be a success the exchange of money for sweets is not once shown during the movie.  My vote for an Oscar nomination would only have gone to Lena Olin for her rich portrayal of a battered wife picking herself up and starting over as Binoche's assistant chocolatier.  Rating ***(Three Stars, out of four) for a trifle that is sweet but not filling enough to serve as a full cinematic meal.

The movie was light and airy, and never really took itself too seriously. The characters are a bit too stereotyped to actually exist in real life, and there is a Magic-Realism aspect to the film that is never explored beyond a cursory level.  All that doesn't matter, though, because this film is not one you want to ponder.  Chocolat works because it's fun to watch.  The plot doesn't get too leaden with melodrama,and there are plenty of scenes designed to get cheers.  This is a movie where you root for the good guys, and boo the bad ones.  Another great bit of fun was that every time anything chocolate appeared on screen, we yelled out Chocolat! in our best Juliette Binoche impersonations.  By the end of the picture we had several rows of people doing it.  Much like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, this seemed to improve the experience greatly.

It is absolutely enchanting and leaves you with a serene smile on your lips. Juliette Binoche who arrives seemingly by magic in a small french town changes the life of all the people who come into contact with her. The movie is absolutely NOT anti-christian, it simply is about a world bound by all too rigid rules, it is about people who do not dare to realize themselves and their wishes because they think it wouldn't be appropriate or understood or simply out of line with what is expected of them. Who hasn't come across such people? Or experienced such a situation? Binoche has a fairy godmother's mission help people to be simply themselves. This holds true for the rigid mayor who does not want to face the fact that his wife has left him for good as well as for the young priest who does not dare to hold the sermon he wishes and feels and for the daughter who is ashamed of her unconventional mother (Dench)...and for many other characters in the movie. The film also teaches a lesson it is much more difficult to behave like you feel than to conform to an expectation. Just look at our society most of the time we feel that we need to live up to a role - on the job, in the relationship, in our leisure time. But why? Why not do what we feel like doing...even if that seems out of place at the moment? Chocolat will be loved by everyone - male and female - who still has has an open heart, who is still able to see the world through a child's eyes with wonder, naivité and enthusiasm and who is still able to enjoy small things a taste, a colour or simply the spring air.

I just couldn't resist myself while watching this movie. It's so likable. Not only that, Chocolat is very well acted by an international cast of actors. Oscar-winning French actress Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) stars as a woman who breezes into a small French village (with her young daughter) and sets up shop as a maker of magic chocolates that brings happiness and joy to those who stop in for a taste. Binoche (nominated for Best Actress this year) is terrific in this movie, and so is everyone else. Oscar-winning British actress Dame Judi Dench is featured in another one of her great film roles as Binoche's crabby and stubborn landlady who begins to show off her good side once she takes a taste of those chocolates. She is currently up for Best Supporting Actress. Another Brit, Alfred Molina, has the role of the strict mayor of the town who thinks something fishy is going on with that new woman in town. Oscar-nominated Swedish actress Lena Olin (Enemies A Love Story) is the battered wife of the local bar owner (played by another Swede, Fargo's Peter Stormare) who comes to work for Binoche. Canadian Carrie-Anne Moss (from The Matrix) plays Dench's estranged daughter who's son secretly visits Grandma. And American Johnny Depp is the young man who also lends a hand to Binoche, and in the process falls in love with her. Chocolat isn't a great movie.

Vianne (Juliette Binoche) is the only one without desire (or is she?) in this movie as she plays the love goddess/witch/wise women who blows into town with the north wind, allowing the inhabitants of the quaint village to live out their long held desires. Nothing will be the same again.By intuitively choosing each character's favourite chocolate, she allows them to break free from the oppressive restraints of life in this church dominated, claustrophobic country town.  Oddly, the repression is overtly represented by the Mayor, played by Alfred Molina, rather than the village priest, as one might expect.The unfolding of this classic three part drama is supported by superb casting, with Binoche beatific, Judi Dench brilliant and Molina taking the prize with his (mostly) understated performance as the villain with the soft centre (another chocolate metaphor?).  Johnny Depp, as the otherwise plot-pointless Irish gypsy, looks suitably decorative and does well as the love interest for the love goddess.  After all, she had to get some reward for all the love she brings to people's lives!The warmth and wit of the script and the engaging characters are complemented by the great sets and gorgeous photography to make an overall wonderful film that had the audience in my cinema spontaneously applauding as the credits rolled!

Opening a patisserie (actually, a chocolaterie) on Lent shocks the locals no end, especially the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina, in a role you'd expect Nathan Lane to play), the town's mayor and self-appointed moral guardian.  But that's just the beginning  the mystical Vianne soon creates all manner of havoc with her patisserie, including stirring up the relationship between feisty, strong-willed Armande Voizin (Judi Dench, appealing and watchable as always) her  emotionally withdrawn daughter Caroline (a surprisingly good Carrie-Anne Moss) and grandson Luc (Aurelien Parent-Koenig).  Vianne has her own complications, though, thanks to the arrival of charming, roguish river rat Roux (Johnny Depp), who manages to completely steal Vianne's heart.Of course, things come to a head as Reynaud tries, with increasing desperation, to head off what he sees as increasing licentiousness during the high holy period of Christianity.  And could that be because Reynaud himself has something to hide?  Those who complain the loudest...Halstrom makes the most of an appealing cast in Chocolat.  Although I guessed several plot points well in advance of their occurrence, the movie is so good-natured a fable,  and the cast is so much fun to watch, that I feel like a curmudgeon just pointing out its flaws.And so, to sum up this too-long review  Just go and have a good time already.

Tranquilité. The best possible description of life in this quiet village. But soon Vianne opens a chocolaterie which threatens to ruin the serene existence of the town. Most perturbed is the straight-edge, Catholic fundamentalist mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Molina), for what represents temptation more than luscious chocolate? And to open a chocolate shop in the middle of Lent?! The nerve! Reynaud tries persistently to ruin Vianne's business and to run her and the immorality she represents out of town.This movie is deceptively simple. The story itself is enticing; a treat to watch; full of emotion and hilarity. But behind the beautiful cinematography lies symbolism. The urn, the Northwesterly winds - there is meaning in everything. This aspect is neither overdone, nor ignored. In the end, Chocolat is a film about the continuing battle between tradition and modernization. It's a story about the revealing the undying yearning within ourselves - the yearning for something new and exhilarating. Something indulging.The performances are fantastic. Binoche is at her finest. Judi Dench is remarkable as always. Molina is phenomenal, and everyone else just seems perfectly casts. There isn't a single character that you don't want to empathize with at some point or another.

I won't go too much into what happens as some of the plot would be revealed, possibly spoiling your enjoyment of this film.You meet some delightful characters, including the young priest who has a penchant for rock and roll, in a time when it was still deemed morally wrong to have such inclinations, the tired downtrodden wife whose life gets far more interesting when her husband discovers Vianne's delightful chocolat and some not so nice characters like the local cafe owner who routinely beats his wife played by Lena Olin (who, incidently is also wife of the director of the film, Lasse Hallstrom), unbeknownst to the villagers.At times this sweet film goes overboard with niceness and eagerness to please, but for the most part it is a balanced film, with a little bit of romance, humour and morals to keep you entertained. If you are a Johnny Depp fan (which I am) you might be dissapointed with the screen time given to his character (or not given as the case is), but apart from that I highly recommend this film.

I am also addicted to movies so they balance each other out at times.  I have gone into movies like The Matrix, Die Hard and when I was younger, On Golden Pond, with a cocky assurance that I was going to hate these films.  In every case, not only have they proved me wrong, but they have gone on to become some of my favourite films of all times.  I made the same mistake with Chocolat.  Here's how the story goes.I had gone to the closest AMC theater in Oakville to see Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  I hadn't seen it yet and the paper said it started at 1230 pm.  When I got there it actually started at 230.  I started work that day 400 and there were no other films playing that I hadn't seen.  So my options were either go home and do nothing for a few hours or go see the one film that I ridiculed in my mind as being nothing more than some stupid foreign film about some stupid topic like how chocolate is an aphrodisiac, or something.  So I decided to pay my $8.00 ( expensive matinees at AMC ), get my M&M's and go see the show.  I slouched down in my seat and disdainfully looked around to see the theater half filled with elderly women.  I groaned as I remembered a similar situation last year when I was Topsy Turvy ( a film that I hated).   So I was peeved off.  The movie begins and I am still angry and it begins like the way I thought it would.  Some small dumb-ass village in France or some God foresaken place has their church goers in church and a stupid voice over is telling me that the church runs the town and if you have problems no one wants to hear about them because that is bad for the church and so on.  Then some stupid lady and her daughter wander in and they want to rent a property from some dumb old lady... oh wait a minute, that is Judi Dench, okay, that is cool.  I like Judi Dench, she cracks me up with her abrasiveness.  She was the only thing I liked about Shakespeare In Love.  Anyway.... ....you get the picture.  Twenty minutes into this film I was sitting straight up and loving every single minute of this film.  It had control of me and it never let me go.  I was now in complete submissive splendor as I watched the film about how chocolat can cure marriages, ripen a sour mother/daughter relationship, loosen the tight strings the church has on the town folk and so on.  And the more I watched, the more I realized that the film was just a metaphor for a great many things, but one thing in general. I think it was telling us to lighten up.  The powers that be in this film were always so concerned with not only what was right and wrong but in how they looked doing it.  Vianne ( Binoche ) was concerned with living life. She did not subscribe to the theories of Lent, she was not married but had a daughter, she did not know who the father was and so on.  She is not exactly what you would call a model citizen but she represents a certain freedom. She lives her life the way she sees fit and no one is going to tell her other wise.  Soon, the entire town comes to her for advise and she gives them chocolate.This is one of the best films of the year.  Traffic is the run away winner as the best film of the year but Chocolat is certainly a worthy contender. The cast of Binoche, Dench, Johnny Depp, Alfred Molina ( remember him from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the guy that drops Indy's whip and leaves him in the cave to die and says throw me the whip I throw you the idol ) Carrie Anne Moss, Peter Stormare and Lena Olin are all excellent and I would hope that Binoche gets some consideration in March.This is not a film that should be missed.

A single mother and her ten year old daughter come into a small French town carrying suitcases.  It's a blustery storm and they are wearing red capes with hoods.  The church is full of sad-faced penitants and the congregation is reminded that it is Lent, and they are to sacrifice as Christ, the Lord sacrificed, so that God's children could be free of (original) Sin.The people are downhearted and desolate to begin with, and can hardly be expected to deny themselves further.  The mayor, a religious fanatic, attempts to control the morality of the townspeople by imploring the new young priest to preach self-abnegation.  Caught off-guard, the young priest is singing, You ain't nothin' but a houn' dog, which is a hint of what is to come.By some miracle the woman and her daughter clean up a dirty, cobwebbed shop and open up a patisserie featuring chocolate, every variety you can imagine.  The mayor is outraged and promises to drive her out of town.  He spreads rumors that she is evil and her daughter, illegitimate.  It comes out that they are constantly on the move, and the girl wants to settle down.  The mother has Mayan artifacts and brings in a sense of the exotic.  Instead of the forbidden fruit, it is chocolate.She gives away samples.  Huge stores of chocolate are delivered from some unknown source.  The woman is young, beautiful and always smiling, displaying a disarming self-confidence despite being strangers in the town and viewed with suspicion.Soon the samples begin to have their effect.  People are smiling.  Some have a whimsical aphrodisiac effect.  More and more people come to the store and taste her wares.  The mayor is outraged and is determined to drive her out of town, believing that these tempting sweets are the exact opposite of what is expected during Lent.There are numerous subplots of pain and change as the chocolates seem to captivate the townspeople.  Breaking rules seems to be the order of the day.  The widowed, grieving and lonely mayor steps up his holy war and terrible things happen.Little by little, the subplots are amazingly resolved and everybody lives happily ever after.

Realizing, as is true now, that what I want to comment on is other comments, I usually let it go.I think the fine talent the entire cast, the director, screenwriter and production designer have made a film that speaks for itself quite well.  But we, as audience members, need to lighten up.  Criticism based on the Paganism vs. Christianity theme, or the fact that certain elements in this fairy tale are unbelievable seems extraordinarily shallow.The film is not about Chocolate, or the value of Paganism.  It is the story of a woman who improves the lives of a town--not with her secret Chocolate recipes--by her understanding, compassionate soul.Every rebuff she encounters from the rigid, unbending, repressive establishment she finds herself in is met with friendliness, open acceptance, and desire to communicate, and yes, love.It is through this understanding acceptance, when all indications are that she should strike out in confrontation or leave, that the true meaning of the Christianity that is being practiced by the town members is finally manifested.  In the final analysis it is not Paganism that alters the brittle condition of the town, it is Christian love.If one looks at the fact that Easter is really a Pagan holiday, Christianized, this theme of acceptance and tolerance and love is given many dimensions.This is a fine film, well worth the evening price I paid for it, if one can take of the cynical glasses long enough to enjoy it.  If nothing else, go watch some brilliant actors deal with these emotions and themes.While I still hold that Chocolate is only a symbol, and not what the film is about, I did find myself compelled to go have some mole at a Mexican restaurant after the show. ) "},{"Title":"Heart-warming fairy tale with enticing chocolates, lovely scenery, & endearing characters-chocolate is a gift of the gods!","Date":"8 January 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I saw this film in the theatre on January 6, 2001.  I found it to be a simple and heart-warming story of Vianne Rocher (played by Juliette Binoche) and her mature and sweet pre-teen, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol).  Vianne has inherited a strange South American penchant to drift with the annual coming of the North Wind and set up a luscious chocolate shop in town after town.  The two come in 1960 to a small, beautiful, riverside French village, and find closed-minded townsfolk, led by a mayor with an obsessive penchant to moralizing against even the pleasures of chocolate.One needs to reserve being overly analytical, in particular in trying to understand how Vianne can afford her generosity and move her business with so many supplies so frequently (though there is a quick early scene showing a truck unloading some material), but I saw the film as a charming fairy tale.  I very much enjoyed the characters - the self-assured, independent, confident, warmth-exuding Vianne; kind beyond her years Anouk, a role model for a pre-teen -); and the fiercely individualistic river rat Roux (Johnny Depp).  Though it certainly wasn't her strongest showing, it was nice to see Judi Dench playing the part of a curmudgeonly grandmother, Amande Voizin (coincidentally, just before I had gone to the film, I saw her in two of her famous British television comedies, A Fine Romance and one of my favorites, As Time Goes By).The scenery of Chocolat was lovely, as were the touches of South American pan flute music.

Chocolat can best be appreciated through its child narrator as a fairy tale, albeit for adults.  It is darker than Babette's Feast, less sensual than Like Water for Chocolate (largely wasting the Johnny Depp character), less personal than A Big Night, but thankfully less contrived than What's Cooking.  There are elements of mystery and of improbability that could only be understood in the context of make belief.  How else could one understand the 'old tranquility' of a rather pleasant French town that is dominated by one man?  How else could one rationalize a wandering woman and child who seek to liberate the suppressed human emotions of straight-laced people all over through the use of Mayan chocolate?  Interestingly, the Catholic Church gets pushed around as a mere puppet, a symbol of intolerance and indoctrination for those in power.  Those religious virtues of obedience, penitence, and self-denial get no respect either.  Story aside, there are some good performances starting with Juliette Binoche who could elevate any film by her mere presence and Lena Olin as the abused fighting back.  Judi Dench steals the screen everything she appears while Alfred Molina does a good, 'Father Knows Best' routine.  Even Carrie-Ann Moss proves she can do more than just kickbox and the little 'Ponette' (Victoire Thivisol) continues to excel as a child actress.  It's too bad the film never develops the love relationship between the older man and woman, (using Leslie Caron in a surprisingly limited and non-speaking role) she grieving for over 40 yrs over the wartime death of her husband.  Chocolat, accepted for being a fable, a French version of Pleasantville, is a good Saturday afternoon divertissement, similar to going out to taste sweet nothings.

The center conflict between Afred Molina, as the Mayor, and Juliette Binoche, as the mystical confectioner, was entertaining, but hollow as a chocolate Easter bunny. Lena Olin's battered wife was very well acted, but the character was also a bit thin. Johnny Depp was very good as a wispy hippy Celt. The child actors were adept and suitably restrained.

The story of the repressed French Village and how a mysterious new arrival changes the lives of the people in it with one of lifes best pleasures, chocolat, the film is truly beautiful.  I can describe it as a pleasure for the senses, a spiritual awakening, and a fairy tale for adults rolled into one.The breathtakingly beautiful Julitte Binoche heads the cast as Vianne Rocher, a free spirit who arrives in town on a windy day along with her daughter Anouk.  She opens a chocolat shop that becomes the talk of the town and a meeting place for its more interesting inhabitants.  Her presence changes the lives of the villagers for the better.  Binoche's subtle performance is excellant as the stunning yet earthy Vianne.  The performances of the rest of the cast are equally well done, with such fine actors as Judi Dench and Peter Stormare playing the villagers.  Lena Olin and Alfred Molina are standouts as an abused innkeepers wife and the stern mayor of the town, respectively.  And Johnny Depp as a riverboat gypsy and Binoche's love interest is tremendous as usual (Depp is one of the best actors in film today).I read the book by Joanne Harris before it was made into a movie and the film is an excellent adaption of it, more successful than most others.The scenes of the chocolate, or in this case chocolat being prepared are a real treat to watch, and had me craving truffles thoughout the film.  This film is minus any of the sarcastic, cynical, dark, and overly pragmatic tones of many of todays movies, which are all to often qualities people mistake as making up a quality or serious film.

It even opens with a voice-over that begins Once Upon a Time..but it's not a children's film.  The film's tone is reminiscent of a child's fairy tale, but the film has adult sensuality and a conflict regarding religious beliefs as well. It's also an English language film (in case you were wondering) with an international cast of Swedish, German, English, American and French actors.The film is not all gooey sweetness and charm and refuses to play it safe. It does not shy away from its sensuality and allows it's actors to show us more than one dimension of character.  Even the heavies are presented with a degree of compassion.   It's ultimately a romantic sensual film concentrating more on spirituality, fantasy and sensuality than on action, machismo and sex.  It is more a women's picture than a guy's movie.I believe Chocalat will soon become a very much admired holiday themed film for teenagers and adults to watch year after year.  It's more of an Easter holiday themed film, since it is set during Lent in 1959 than a Christmas film however. It's a film that is more than a war between the ideologies of paganism and Christianity, and concerns itself with the true meaning of compassion, acceptance and understanding.  It's a better film than it was a book.We are introduced to the film with a brief voice over that begins Once Upon Time and shown  a remote French village, introducing a couple of it's characters.  There's an unfortunate over-use of some obvious CGI effects in the first establishing shots of the town.The town is ruled as it has been for generations by a member of the de Reynaud family.  An ancestors statue sternly stands guard in the center of town..  We meet the Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who insists everyone it the town observe weekly mass, and adhere to a formal belief in Christianity. He's the richest man in tower, the mayor and he helps the new priest in town by editing and rewriting his sermons&#150;which he will later use to help turn the townspeople against the newest member of the village. His wife however has been a long extended Holiday in Italy&#150;perhaps not intending to ever return. (In the book, it was the priest who was the heavy&#150;the change means we don't see a priest being tyrannical and hypocritical instead he's a pawn in another man's &#145;war'. This isn't playing it safer though, it's opening it up to be more than a battle of paganism versus Christianity.). The Count believes in leading by example, so he's hard on himself, barely eating anything during his Lental fast and certainly not sweets.A mysterious woman named Vianne ( played superbly by Julliette Binoche) and her child Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) appears as if traveling on a strong North Wind into the small town.  It is the way of these two. They have moved from town to town, sometimes leaving by choice, sometimes run out of town by a scared and fearful populace.  Vianne rents a long shuttered bakery from a crabby suspicious old woman (marvelously played by Judi Dench).  When the Count stops by to introduce himself to Vianne and invite her to church service, Vianne informs him she doesn't go to church.  When he frowns on the idea that she is going to open her bakery during Lent, she informs him it will not a bakery but only says what she is doing is a surprise.  The Count is shocked to learn that Vianne is not widowed, but has never been married. He immediately is threatened by her presence and fears she means to challenge everything he stands for.  Does she?  It would seem not to be the case, but her presence is disruptive to the town.Finally she opens a chocolatier, specializing in all kinds of exotic chocolates, some promising to cure headaches, lift spirits and even save marriages.  We learn Vianne has a secret Chocolate recipe used by an ancient civilization and passed on to her by her mother.  A mother who felt it was her destiny to share her chocolate with the world and now... so does her daughter.How dare this brazen, unmarried, possible atheist woman open a decadent chocolate shop during Lent !!!   Who does she think she is?   The Count decides she is the enemy and must be banished from the town.   Meanwhile, she is winning converts... one of her secret chocolate recipes has brought passion back into a marriage, another has lifted up the spirits of her cranky old land-lady who then is re-united with her estranged grandson, and she befriends and then protects  the abused wife (wonderfully played by Lena Olin-director Hallstrom's wife) of a tavern owner (Peter Stormare).  She even encourages a romance between old timers (John Wood and Leslie Caron &#150;yes THAT Leslie (An American in Paris) Caron.Who is this woman who almost seems to be dabbling in witchcraft, is making some changes in the townspeople, has an illegitimate daughter and refuses to go Church?  What is her real agenda? Is she evil?When a wandering band of Irish Gypsy river rats appears, the town quickly shuns them by order of the Mayor, The Count.  They can't legally kick them out of the town but they can make them want to go when they can find any odd jobs to get paid and they aren't served food or drink anywhere in the town. The leader of the River Rats (Johnny Depp) is accepted however by Vianne and a romance blossoms which further ostracizes her from the town and sets up a near tragic situation which leads to the film's conclusion.  It's not a completely predictable conclusion however&#150;though certainly one which will please most audiences.Johnny Depp in his supporting role as   Roux, has never been more relaxed, nor as effective as he is here.  He's even got a good sounding Irish accent which sounds natural rather than actor forced.  Depp's been getting some critical notices for many years and he's been good in several pictures, but usually his technique as an actor brings an aloofness to the characters he portrays preventing them from being completely believable.  I've enjoyed his performances but this is the first time he seems completely at ease and natural.Director Lasse Hallstrom fresh off The Cider House Rules, and writer Rober Nelson Jacobs (from the novel by Joanne Harris) find the perfect balance of drama and comic whimsy to create a warm modern fable.Like the best fables there's a gentle, simple sweetness to the tale which requires a strong suspension of belief in the viewer.  There's a naivety to the story and characters in the film which could only exist in a fictional world.   We aren't bulldozed into the films charms, and we aren't spoon fed its sweetness either.  There are some moments of bitterness as well.  The film realizes several perfectly realized little moments which gave me a sense of exhilaration--the type I have felt while watching films like Wizard of Oz or It's a Wonderful Life.  And while Chocolat isn't quite that good, it does come close in many ways.  It's a film I look forward to viewing and enjoying many more times. . . perhaps annually during Lent.Chris Jarmick, Author (The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

In fact, more than the film's characterizing food, Lasse Hallström's Chocolat symbolizes these little pleasures and delights that, once you taste them, make you inevitably wonder if it's worth troubling over the mightier matters of life especially when it's governed by the rigid hand of morality, when succumbing to the temptation or luring people into it, become a difficult, even perilous, mission.Chocolat is set in a French village with an unmemorable name, one of these 'once upon a time' old-fashioned little places, whose people live according to tacit rules and codes that remained unperturbed for centuries. It's a village à la Frank Capra with a mayor, a priest, a grouchy lady, an old mourning widow, a lonely man walking across the street with his dog, a mad woman who hides a concealed wound in her heart, and so one and so forth. And the village's austere and apparently sinister stagnancy only calls for a stranger to break the morbid routine. Her name is Vianne Rocher, and the village, naturally, will never be the same after her arrival.I wonder how the producers were convinced to make a film that exploits so many of the usual archetypes that nourished our classic knowledge, in a world that got so eagerly sucked into the progresses of technology, action and fast-paced thrillers. Indeed, when fairytale and sentimentality mostly belong to animation, Chocolat's presence feels as awkward as Vianne's in the village. They probably thought that it's today's very audience that would need that kind of nostalgic escapism or that the film would never fail to touch the hearts, because the heroine is portrayed by Juliette Binoche. And yes, as Vianne Rocher, Binoche is the secret ingredient that gives the film its delicious flavor.Only Binoche could carry the perfect mixture of alluring tenderness and enigmatic confidence, she's not just the typical 'cute shop owner', she's the embodiment of that sly wind blowing from the North, like a fresh air about to dust off the village's preconceived ideas, and undermine the dominance of mayor Comte de Reynaud, played by Alfred Molina. His antagonism with Vianne starts with her inconvenient timing; she opens a chocolate shop during the Lent, much more at Sunday hours. His invitation (more like a polite coercion) to join the church forces her to reveal that she's not religious, not married, which makes the existence of her seven-year-old daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) even more accusing.And with her unusual lifestyle, fittingly red clothing and seemingly defiant attitude toward religion (despite its optimistic and good-hearted facade), Vianne doesn't get the warmest welcome from the townspeople. Yet she's ready to win each heart, one by one, all it will take is one taste from each one's favorite chocolate (which she mysteriously guesses) to reignite a marital flame, or even draw a smile in the face of Armande, her opinionated landlady, played by Judi Dench, the second perfect casting of the film. Armande's bitterness is the sad result of a conflict with her overprotective daughter Caroline (Carrie Ann-Moss) who's forbidden her son Luc to visit his 'badly-influencing' grandmother. The chocolate shop soon becomes the refuge for Armande and Luc to meet each other and develop a secret bond.The other subplots involve Josephine (Lena Olin) who's brutalized by Serge, her drunken husband, the bartender played by Peter Stormare, and as expected, her growing friendship with Vianne gives her enough confidence to stand against Serge during a violent assault, when she finally overpowers him with a skillet. Thankfully, this is the kind of uninspired caricature that only works because the movie doesn't get any further. The film remains faithful to its initial tone, and never falls in the temptation to depict the religious townspeople as intolerant bigots. And even Molina remains closer to a more aristocratic version of Hercule Poirot than any other mustached villain; he's a man whose prejudices are rooted in marital troubles that led him to vent his anger on a free-spirited female like Vianne. But the film intelligently avoids the reverse Manichaeism that would have placed religion or men as the obligatory scapegoats.Chocolat is all about allowing one's spirit to elevate beyond the limits dictated by a book, and find one's own truth within the inner beauty of what life, or God for that matter, has to offer. Little Anouk has an imaginary friend named Pantoufle, a kangaroo with an injured leg, but it's just an innocent touch to highlight that she's inherited her mother's mysterious sparkle. A romance also blooms with the arrival of a group of gypsies, drafting along the river, among them the handsome guitar player named Roux (Johnny Depp). Depp's chemistry with Binoche never feels like a plot device we do believe a woman who was so badly received would embrace newcomers with a more generous heart. At the end, all the characters' arcs close in an emotionally satisfying way, not always unpredictable, but it doesn't really affect the enjoyment.Of course, it's tempting to judge Chocolat with more cynical eyes, but how about imagining how respectful to the audience's sensitivity, the film remains? How one-dimensionally feminist it would have been if other women were victims of men's abuses, how simplistically sentimental if a mother-and-daughter argument between Armande and Caroline had broken, while a simple look was enough to show that the two women finally made peace. And finally, how dreadfully caricatured if an angry torch-wielding mob came to burn the chocolate shop&#x85; well, I'm grateful to the story for not having taken this path and yet kept the overall simplicity of its plot without depicting the villagers as a one-dimensional bunch, in a way or another.The film's spirit is magnificently conveyed by a catchy guitar tune, transporting us in a universe where benign and innocent temptations, open the Pandora box where we can find the key to our own happiness. Too poetic? Well, that's another adjective that fits with Chocolat. "},{"Title":"Mildly enjoyable.

I wasn't keen to see this film though I do like the ensemble. Fortunately, it is very well-acted, particularly Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench who both earned well deserved nominations, but the film skims the surface of its story and characters. It's quite an unconventional take on a well established formula. A mysterious figure enters a town, changes it, then leaves. Here, Binoche's chocolate just makes the conservative town horny. Its style is in light supply. Slight comedy, slight tragedy, and it takes obvious turns. Its drama is soap opera- esque at best if not necessarily melodramatic. That's all nice and fine and whatever for brain- off and half-a-tear cinema but it rings false and merely Oscar-baiting. It's still enjoyable and worth it for Binoche but not even Alfred Molina or Johnny Depp could lift it to a place of sincerity.

In this sense it reminds me a lot of Dogville, which starts in a very similar setting; a woman arriving to a small town with a closed community.The movie never takes itself too serious to be believable but real people with real problems can easily reflect and relate to the characters in the movie. It also leaves itself up for interpretation depending on the side from which we are looking at it.For me the lesson learned that generosity and patience can pay off, and that the most dangerous wrongdoers are the ones, who are sure they are doing the right thing.Acting is for the most part superb, but for me less known faces could have made the movie more believable (Carrie-Ann Moss particularly reminds me of the Matrix). But most of all the script and the storytelling gives the power and the charm of the movie and the acting is the chili and the spices on the top of the chocolate.

Given the billing of actors, and the film's director (Lasse Hallstrom of The Cider House Rules) and production team (the Weinstein brothers), one would expect the film to be well put-together, and it is.Judi Dench is, as always, impeccable. She surely is one of the most naturally- gifted actors to grace the screen. Juliette Binoche carries her part consistently, however, there were brief flashes when I thought she looked a little too forced in the role of benevolent chocolatier.I personally felt that it was the work of the supporting actors that stole the show The aforementioned Judi Dench; Alfred Molina as the Comte who controls the town, but, in the end, cannot control himself; Lena Olin as the kicked-while-she's-down wife; Johnny Depp, sublimely heavenly as the river rat/love interest and who could forget Victoire Thivisol as the guileless daughter Anouk.These actors bring a quality to this film, yet I felt that some moments in the movie were a little contrived and erring slightly on corny- for example *spoiler* Towards the end of the film, the scene in which several brave townspeople band together to help make chocolate treats for an upcoming festival seems designed to stir up warm fuzzies inside viewers. Also, it sometimes seems as if Vienne fixes the lives of the villagers a little too quickly and neatly- which is why this film could be seen as attempting to pander to an audience that wishes to be fulfilled in an uplifting, satisfying way.This film was also marketed as a comedy, and the first half fits the bill perfectly. Naturally, it's not a laugh-a-minute, but there are many funny lines that make you giggle.OK, so it can be a little corny at moments. However, as Chocolat progresses, issues such as acceptance, tolerance, the breaking of archaic tradition, and the finding of inner strength, particularly in women, are well explored.All in all, Chocolat is a fine film that will be enjoyed by many people, almost as satisfying as their favorite chocolate treat.

The movie is directed by Lasse Hallström What's Eating Gilbert Grape (IMDB link http//www.imdb.com/title/tt0108550/ ) another fabulous movie, I am yet to see.The movie is set in a beautiful French village, whose name I forget, but that's not important.

Vianne Rocher plays the single mother of a child, who moves from one village to another. why? its another story that ties to Central America, Mayans, and Chocolate (btw, you should try Venezuelan chocolate, if you haven't. Its a delicious evil.). Ahem. So the main story deals with the chocolaterie Vianne opens at this time and the narrow minded Mayor who vows to kill her business by the end of Lent, when Easter comes.On the one hand the Mayor tries to portray Vianne as the evil and tries to spread slander about her. On the other hand, some of the villagers are drawn to her chocolaterie due to her charming demeanour, kind heart, and of course sweets! One of the important customers to her shop comes for the aphrodisiacal chocolates with its magical and unbelievable effects.The story takes a turn with the arrival of a group of river drifters, led by Roux. The stereotypical image of these amongst the villagers is that of an evil group of people that have tendencies to corrupt children. Vianne, who is much broader in her mindset mixes freely with Roux and the group causing these folks quite a bit of discomfort.Needless to say, from here the conflict gets heady due to sudden turn of events.

The movie did get a lot of good reviews and many people recommended it to me, but I wasn't very sure that this would be something for me to see. Well, after hesitating so long, I finally gave it a try, hoping that this would be some kind of modern fairy tale like for instance the marvelous French movie Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulin. Big was my surprise when I finally saw it...The story is rather different from what I thought I would see. It tells the tale of a single mother, Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), who arrives in a small, peaceful and conservative French town with her six year old daughter. She will open a chocolate shop with Sunday hours and across the street from the local church, just as lent is beginning. The local narrow-minded community doesn't really accept this and the mayor will do anything to get it closed as soon as possible. But gradually he looses his grip on his civilians and one by one they get hooked on the delicious chocolates and the warm personality of Vianne...Chocolat is a very nice movie with a nice story, but calling it a masterpiece isn't exactly right. Sure, I liked it a lot, but there were a few things that just didn't give me the satisfaction I was looking for. One thing for example was the language. I know, this may sound very stupid to many, but why do the characters have to speak English in this movie? I mean, they choose a lot of French actors who will play a certain role in a French town, but they all speak English with, so now and then, a little word of French in between. That's really something I didn't understand. Another thing that bothered me a bit was Johnny Depp's role in this movie. He never got a lot of time to show what he's worth. His character is so underdeveloped that it made me believe Depp's only role was to attract as many American viewers as possible, who would otherwise never be interested in this movie.But I have to admit that the movie also had a lot of nice things to offer. As I already said, the story is nice, but it's thanks to the acting of people like Juliette Binoche and the young Victoire Thivisol, that this movie still worked so well. And what shouldn't be forgotten either is the marvelous photography of course. Not only did the village look very nice, so did the chocolate shop and all those tasty-looking sweets. Overall I would say that this may not be a masterpiece, but it's a lovely and heart warming film that certainly deserves a view. I reward it with a 7.5/10, perhaps an 8/10.

The story told in chocolat is very alike to the quoted movie's. A woman who settled down in a Danish village prepares a feast to thank them for their kindness. This dinner changes for a while their vision of the world. Here, the action takes place in a French village and a chocolate shop has replaced the feast and it is owned by a single woman, Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) with her daughter, Anouk. This chocolate shop also changes the inhabitants' vision of the world.Honestly, I didn't appreciate this movie very much for several reasons. There's no denying that Hallstrom shows tenderness and humanity for his characters and especially for Vianne. But I think he makes her kindness excessive and highlights too much this character trait that ends up annoying. As a consequence, it gives a movie overloaded with good feelings. Vianne Rocher, through her (excessive) kindness enables numerous inhabitants to find happiness again (Luc Clairmont, Mme Audel) or to start a new life again (Josephine Muscat).Chocolat is a movie that doesn't shine by its originality and follows a predictable progression, especially after Johnny Depp's arrival. Because she's exasperated with the mayor's scornful behavior, Vianne wants to leave the village but she finds certain inhabitants in her chocolate shop preparing her treats so as to make her stay. You can guess the rest. Furthermore, the director doesn't manage to avoid a few traps that the topic was setting, notably the stereotyped characters. They are mainly epitomized by the mayor and his secretary who look unfavorably on Vianne's settlement. It is to be noted that the secretary (Carrie-Anne Moss) is among the inhabitants who prepare treats for Vianne in the quoted sequence. So, you won't have to wait very long to see the mayor give in to the pleasure of chocolate. In another extent, there is of course the inevitable (although short) love affair between Binoche and Depp.All this makes a superficial movie To approach with caution.

The routineness of the town is shattered when a mysterious woman (Juliette Binoche) is carried in on a north wind, as the narrator tells us, and opens a chocolate store, which slowly releases the passion for self-indulgence of everyone in the town.Molina put on a superb performance as the Mayor, and Binoche was also very good as Vianne, the chocolate shop owner, although I thought her performance came across as surprisingly low key, considering she played the leading role. Also noteworthy was Hugh O'Conor as the hapless parish priest, completely under the thumb of Reynaud, who has to proofread and approve every sermon he writes.Somehow, though, this just never really grabbed hold of me. I didn't think it was bad. Quite the contrary. It was - as I said - a very pleasant movie to watch.

I couldn't believe that two great actors such as Juliette Binoche (code inconnu) and Johnny Depp accept to cast in this movie.In addition to the weakness of the movie, there is something that I found very incoherent. How come that the people, who have French names and are living in French village, speak English? It is quite ridiculous to hear them calling themselves in a very typical French way and then continue their sentence in English. How could the director think of hiring American actors? But I have to admit that something stroke greatly my attention. The village itself is very beautiful. All the shots of the surroundings are amazing. I loved them so much that I really feel like going to this village (hoping that the director didn't computerize the images). Also, Juliette Binoche preparing the chocolate in a type of professional cook, opened my appetite for HER chocolate. She is so professional and in this movie she didn't have to play as well as Depp since the story is weak. If anyone disagrees with me give me arguments.

After last years atrocity with all of the nominations for The Cider House Rules, I was sure that they could learn that the number front page ads on the cover of 'Variety' are not proportional to quality.  Chocolat chronicles the life of a 'free-spirited' woman who moves to a stuffy French-Catholic town and proceeds to turn it on its head by making them realize what's really important in life.  Similarities to 'Mary Poppins' are striking.  Instead of opposing straight-laced English Victorian culture, this movie's heroine is a threat to the straight-laced Catholic culture.  Mary helps Michael Banks become his own man and defy his father, Binoche's character helps a young boy break free of the constraints his mother places on him. The entire duration of the film I was wondering when the chimney sweeps were going to show up.The emptiness and forced cuteness of this film are astounding for one that has been so undeservably lauded since its release.  Even though it comes from the same studio and aspires to the same dream of Oscar glory, it lacks the wittiness, irony, and romance of Shakespeare in Love and is just this big jumbled mess of characters and (predictable) plot-twists.None of the acting is particularly noteworthy.  Judi Dench has mastered the art of being Judi Dench, and Johnny Depp has mastered the art of being greasy, but neither of these things really add to the film.  Binoche is good, but unspectacular in a cookie-cutter role that does not allow for much interpretation.

But I kept feeling like I had seen this movie before. Babette's Feast, Footloose and Chocolat all bring nonconformist newcomers to small, conservative communities, where a clash is inevitable. As in Like Water for Chocolate, Vianne's creations work a seeming magic on those who taste them... and like Tita, Vianne seems to be unable to control her destiny. Tita, in Like Water for Chocolate, was unable to marry because of her mother's control. Vianne follows in her mother's footsteps, moving to a new place whenever the north wind blows.As a Christian, I was disappointed by the portrayal of Christians in this movie -- sour and hard-hearted, opposites of Vianne, a sparkling, loving woman who is not a Christian. But I don't blame the film-makers, and I don't count my disappointment as points off my rating of this film. Unfortunately, such a picture of Christians is sometimes justified by our behavior; we would do well to look in the mirror if we feel hurt by how we are portrayed in movies like this. Still, Vianne seems determined to set herself at odds with the Christians from the get-go, and the Christians are more conservative than any I personally know. And would Lenten fasts in France in 1959 really be unbroken even on Sundays? I was raised in the Episcopal church in the 1970s and '80s and was taught that Sundays, even during Lent, were feast days.I wasn't sorry I watched Chocolat. I'd even view it again.

I did the same thing at regular 20-minute intervals for the rest of the video.  By the end of it, my speech was slurred.  And I still didn't like it -- not sober nor drunk.  And let me tell you, that's bad.  I wouldn't recommend it, not to anyone. Juliette Binoche's performance is just way over the top.  Throughout the entire movie, she assaults us with an interminably silly smile, which says, in effect, `I will overcome your suspicion of me, a perfect stranger, with my overpowering charm.'  She's always dispensing wisdom, charity, and beneficence, not to mention being all knowing and all wise.  She can tell, just by looking at people, and performing her own Rorschach test, what they need &#150; a miracle-worker!  She's a doctor, psychiatrist, sociologist, muse, prophet, and friend all rolled into one.  For a person who represents the `sensual' side of the screenplay's silly and contrived spirit/flesh dualism, this makes for a strange dissonance.  Instead of coming off as someone who knows the ecstatic trances and paroxysms of Dionysus, she acts more like the enlightened Athena, never unruffled by passion, whether her own, or others'.  If one of your friends presumed to behave this way, you'd want to bitch-slap her and tell her to cut it out.  And then there's the whole `river-rat' thing, with Johnny Depp as Mr. `tragically cool,' who has everything `all together,' even when they burn his boats.  He's just brimming with stony self-confidence.  But he's always lolling his eyes about, like a puppy, which destroys his efforts to be  `James Dean' cool.

The film is about a very lovely French woman (Oscar-nominated Juliette Binoche) and her young daughter (adorable Victoire Thivisol) who turn a small village upside down when they open a chocolate shop across from the local church and keep the place open during Sunday mornings. Mayor Alfred Molina does not care for Binoche, but soon the entire village cannot resist the lure of the tasty treats. Many side-stories also take place within Chocolat as well. Johnny Depp and his band of gypsies further upset Molina. Abused wife Lena Olin is taken in by Binoche after she leaves crazed husband (Peter Stormare). A love affair blossoms between elderly John Wood and widow Leslie Caron. And conflict continues between mother Judi Dench (Oscar-nominated) and estranged daughter Carrie Anne-Moss (who has feelings for Molina). Chocolat is clever and it feels like classic Hollywood fare. It is a light-hearted comedy at times, but it also expresses important messages with smart drama. The performances are all first-rate. Alfred Molina and Judi Dench are particularly good in supporting turns. Youngster Victoire Thivisol shows real potential ala Haley Joel Osment. Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp also have a real chemistry between them and Depp's appearance half-way through the film only adds to the movie's excellence. Robert Nelson Jacobs' screenplay is intelligent and Lasse Hallstrom's direction is focused as usual. A very good tasting film. 4.5 out of 5 stars.

Never have been.  But I find it interesting that anti-Catholicism (anti-Christianity) is the anti-Semitism of psuedo-intellectuals. The main character is viewed as a woman full of goodness and just wanting to share her goodness with those she comes in contact with.  That is her destiny.  Her almost altruistic nature is what gets her into trouble when she tries to help those in this tranquil town enjoy just a bit more of life. Well, her timing is all wrong.  She happens into town during lent.  A most sacred time for Catholics.  It is a moment of resisting temptation that ends with the holy day of Easter.  This is not a life long resistance.  It happens for about 6 weeks--a drop in the bucket when compared to the other 46 weeks of the year. This movie laughs in the face of this sacred time and covers it in chocolate. When the main character decides to throw a chocolate festival she chooses Easter as the day to do it.  Was this the only day available for such an event? All the other days weren't sacred enough for her? Seems like our harmless heroine is picking fights. It's amazing when a movie attacks religion of the western world it's funny, witty and charming.

This fellow likes challenges, and could develop into a Penn. But he does muck through some strange stuff on the way.Here he is again with Olin, though they share no scenes. This is a walk. (The film has no depth at all beyond showing some presumably lovable characters.) Their last outing together was a pretty interesting trip, with a real director. Depp is like many actors I suppose alternating between dumb stuff for money and projects that he cares about.Everything in this film is borrowed from other films which do it better. (Except the spice thing, which SM Gellar, Demi Moore and Penny Cruz did even worse, Mary Stuart Masterson a little better.)Seeing Olin and Binoche together again reminds of how intelligent films can be, how genuinely transformative. Just not here. Not here. Depp works a lot. But we don't see much of Olin these days, and when we do, it is unchallenging stuff. Mystery Men? She really has an otherworldly carriage. Wouldn't this film have been better with the roles reversed (Binoche and Olin), and with the focus on the boy (and all his presumed sexual comings of age) instead of the Mayor?Could it have been better if we discovered something of the loves abandoned in each preceding town? Perhaps if Depp's character were really given something to do. One wonders, because this is the director of `Gilbert Grape,' so one knows he's not a simpleton., and has used Depp as an artist.So one wonders, if the pairings of Binoche and Olin, Olin and Depp, Depp and Hallstrom each resulted in such fine films, why is this one so vapid?

The film explores the compassion of man with dynamic tone. Indeed the moral of this fairy tale is tolerance, acceptance, of both individuals and their communities. The bright tone of the film is owed largely to the impressionable performance by Juliette Binoche (as Vianne). With a distinctly French setting, Hallstrom offers stimulating photography, an emotive soundtrack, and powerful motif, in his efforts to promote a community spirit, most effectively captivated in the final sequence. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the final scene, although nevertheless, the film suggests a renewed moral depth and a spiritual dimension, a common theme of the literary world in our increasingly secular and perhaps emotionally shallow society.Quite a didactic film, and with an open mind, quite a satisfying film.

This does not make her the most popular person.The film stars Juliette Binoche as the main character Vianne. Vianne is such a likable character. She is friendly to everyone even if the other people are mean to her, she seems to just smile and forgive them. It is no wonder the town grows to love her. Juliette does a great job in her role. She was believable and she really made you feel sorry for her when things were going bad. The movie also stars Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina & Lena Olin.

At first, she isn't popular with the townspeople, mainly because the Reverend(Alfred Molina) is trying to brainwash the town into disliking her.But once she opens up a chocolate shop, she starts to make friends(such as Lena Olin and Judi Dench). But that doesn't stop the Reverend. This guy really can't stand her. It's around Easter time, and he wants everybody to avoid chocolate just because of her. And when they don't he really goes off the deep end.There are some interesting characters, such as Roux(played by Johnny Depp) a french pirate who falls for Vianne. The performances are good, the story is actually quite interesting, but to call this a great movie would be going too far.Halstrom, who directed The Cider house rules and the darkly brilliant Whats eating Gilbert Grape?, made a delightfully sweet film, but that doesn't make it great.

So, though I don't think anyone acted badly, the uncomfortable combination of foreigners reminded me of Star Trek.The film falls between too stools. It's too odd to be realistic, and too realistic to be a fantasy/morality tale. (Having said that, the atmosphere created by the director and designers is often very good.) I was again reminded of lame SF tales by the simplicity of the religious/social aspect of the story. The freethinking outsider disturbing the status quo... and why not throw some gypsies into the mix?!

It is set in a small French town sometime just after The Second World War.It's an unusual tale of people who, in their different ways, are trapped by their own fixed and immutable beliefs and seem helpless to overcome them on their own. Also, they are poorly led by Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) who is both mayor and an intrusive, meddling patriarch. He lives a subtle public lie that his wife is travelling in Italy, when really he alone knows for sure that she has left him and he has no idea how to deal with his inconsolable loss.But through the arrival of some unexpected visitors by fairytale from the outside world, the lives of almost everybody in the village is transformed for the better.First to arrive - blown in by the north wind - are Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her fatherless daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol). Rather miraculously, she opens the old patisserie into a chocolate shop. It is let to her by an elderly lady Armande Voisin (Judi Dench) who is estranged from her daughter Caroline (Carrie-Ann Moss) and her grandson Luc (Aurelien Parent Koening) during the last days of her life.Somehow, once the shop is opened, it becomes a kind of alternative medicine to the people who live in the town. Cocoa-based confectionery is seen on the face of it to be the work of the devil, by Comte de Reynaud, who enlists divine assistance (and suborns a young and impressionable priest) to suppress this ungodly and subversive delight to which he is no more immune than the others.While the village is fighting to reconcile its craving for chocolate with its righteous duty to Roman Catholicism, another spiritual evil - playing slide guitar - is washed downstream by the current. What are pirates to Anouk and are a dark immoral influence to Comte de Reynaud, is pretty much just what the doctor ordered for Vianne.Roux (Johnny Depp) and his motherless daughter have been living the same itinerant lifestyle as the manacled choclateer. Rescuing battered wife Josephine Muscat (Lena Olin) along the way and giving Armande Voisin the going-out party she's always dreamed about, Vianne is released from her own wanderings when her mother's ashes go up in a final puff of smoke.This is a interesting film in which almost everybody lives happily ever after. It is built on the confused logic of a child's thinking, but is filmed without giving away what it is that makes the thought process of adults beyond the comprehension of their children, while leaving their understanding of their emotional situation quite transparent.And we're left pondering the age old question. Chocolate.. is it really a force for evil.. or a force for good ?

Above all, the success of the film is due to the fact that it handles the themes with a rather unique, skillful, and artistic approach.The scenery and cinematography are good and artistic. The images of the town and the way in which the film shows the chocolates and their creation are effective and satisfying. The images thoroughly help create the mood and atmosphere of the film's themes, as well as the power of satisfying food.The use of chocolate in the movie is itself very appealing and fun. It provides the basis for some great visuals and is interesting as a different and effective tool with which to explore the issues in the film. This effect is all the greater because of the strong emotions and sensory stimulus that food, in particular something like chocolate, can create. Without this tool, powerful in hitting viewers' thoughts and senses, the film would have been much weaker.A number of the characters are fairly unusual and complex, with a fair amount of depth while the actors mostly do a very good job at portraying them. They thus add much to the exploration of the themes, keeping the film interesting, and the film successfully handles the development of their characters.One main problem is that sometimes the film comes across as a little too trite and sappy. The basic themes have been explored a lot over the years, which is definitely a problem on this level, and the film is hardly subtle in its handling of them. The familiar, well-worn nature of the themes, while hardly an insurmountable problem, exacerbates the preachy element of the film and combined these factors sometimes make it seem a little too over-the-top and even irrelevant.However, the film is very good overall.It succeeds because of the way in which the themes are explored and the skill in using the visuals, the role of chocolate, and the characters.

The central conflict Chocolate or God? The heathen drifter who opens up a Chocolaterie in a trussed-up town or the town's control-freak mayor/count? You decide. It's obvious where the movie-makers' sympathies lie chocolate, for sure. Of course, in real life, the matter is much more complicated than Lent or eat, but until Hollywood begins exploring actual esoteric spiritual practices (and the individuals who commit to them) rather than continuously trotting out the convenient exoteric straw man of mere believers' religiosity (which tends to either severely control and limit or entirely forbid pleasures of the flesh because all that's truly looked forward to is the world thereafter), there won't be a really interesting film made about the apparent dichotomy between bodily life and religion. That said, the film itself was well-done; acting superb, music beautiful and just right for the style, locations perfect. Judi Dench is a goddess. I was actually hoping the little girl would turn out to have a kangaroo, unexplained, but alas, that would have been too interesting. So the figurative kangaroo hops away at the end, leaving the girl free to grow roots into the town which has come to accept and enjoy the novelty proffered by her mother and her mother's new helpers. All in all, I enjoyed it, got the occasional warm fuzzy, and just felt generally good all over like I do whenever I see anyone (in life or on film) push (or get shown) beyond whatever current limitations bind them. These townspeople were brought from strictness, pseudo-tranquilite, reluctance to embrace anything beyond what they'd been brought up to embrace, and fear of the consequences of that, and into acceptance and embrace of new and unknown things. But who (and how?) will push them beyond chocolate? Probably not Hollywood; not anytime soon, anyway, judging by this.

Johnny Depp plays a supporting role as an Irish gypsy, the same type of homeless wanderer Brad Pitt played (in a much broader interpretation) in SNATCH. Alfred Molina is the town bully, a man who needs to maintain a sense of order at all costs, which Binoche threatens to upset. The radiant Lena Olin plays a battered wife who finds new meaning in her life thanks to Binoche.

No one has a mate, whether through death, divorce or abandonment, but Binoche is there to change that. A simple story, told in a simple and straightforward manner by the great Lasse Hellstrom. But apparently, it fails to compare favorably to the novel. So what else is new? Guys, watch CHOCOLAT at your peril -- or if you need some loving from the missus.

I find it a stretch that Vianne and Henri manage to keep it to themselves.

It's only a matter of time before Vianne wins everyone - and Reynaud - over, and all is right with the world.By the way, the town's name, Lansquenet, is derived from the German landsknecht (valet of the fief), a term applied to a mercenary, which I found interesting as Josephine's dad was a Nazi informer.

Get it at Amazon.)This is an American movie directed by Swedish born director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules, 1999; Something to Talk About, 1995), set in France with a distinct French flavor. The cast, headed by the very talented Juliette Binoche as Vianne Rocher, a wandering proprietress of chocolate, is highly accomplished and very much worth watching. Judi Dench has a substantial role as the cranky Armande, and Johnny Depp makes a belated appearance as Binoche's love interest, Roux, the River Rat. Alfred Molina plays the small town's semi-fascist Catholic mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud. With his slicked-back, straight black hair and the precise black mustache and his imposing countenance, one is somehow reminded of Count Dracula. Leslie Caron (An American in Paris, 1951; The L-Shaped Room, 1963), now in her seventies, has a small part as the widow Madame Audel. Carrie Anne-Moss of Matrix fame (but I recall her most memorably in Memento, 2000) plays Armande's strait-laced and estranged daughter. Noteworthy is the captivating Victoire Thivisol as Anouk Rocher, Vianne's nine-year-old daughter. Thivisol won the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival in 1996 for her work as a four-year-old (!) in Ponette (1996). She is surely the youngest actor ever to win such an award.Chocolat is also a kind of modern Dionysian morality tale in reverse with the Catholic church and small town narrow-mindedness as the bad guys. It gets more than a bit sappy at times, and the unrelenting celebration of outsiders and non-conformists is wearisome and sorely tried my patience throughout. However, just as is the case with chocolate with its uplifting qualities amidst the lure to overindulgence, the good surely outweighs the bad. Hallstrom is an ambitious director who is comfortable playing to an adult feminist audience. He attempts the complex and the unlikely. Here, there is more than the usual Hollywood seduction of the intended audience. There is underneath the surface a strong symbolic presence, giving the story a kind of resonating, fairy tale existence.Chocolate of course serves as the Dionysian wine, but it is also a semi-addictive substance from a tropical American plant, the cacao, rich in sumptuous oils and theobromine, a heart and general nervous system stimulant similar to caffeine. Cocoa was the first stimulant drink to break the unrelenting hold of beer and wine on the European palate. It was quickly followed by coffee and tea. Prior to the rise of these cerebral drinks, it was commonplace for Europeans to drink beer for breakfast, and indeed to drink beer and wine throughout the day. Many believe that caffeine was a handmaiden of the Renaissance, which of course led to the eventual weakening of the hold of the Roman Catholic church. Vianne, who is the daughter of a central American mother and a European father, represents the shamanism of the New World, leading the populace away from the narrow confines of the medieval mentality with her irresistible confections made with the seed of Theoboma cacao.The problem with the movie, and the reason it did not achieve a more wide-spread acclaim, lay not only with its cloyingly unbalanced feminist viewpoint and its anti-Catholicism, but with the difficulty Binoche (and Hallstrom) had with her complex role. Her character is a woman who wants desperately to find a place in society and to be accepted by the petite bourgeoisie while maintaining her personal sense of value (and her red shoes!). She is, in a sense, a gypsy fortune teller (recall the spinning plates) who longs to be a pillar of the community. She is worldly wise, kind and forgiving, but partly a shopkeeper with a shopkeeper's need to set down roots. She is also a Mayan princess born to wander with the sly wind that ushers her about. So, underneath all else, this is a story about finding a home. Because Vianne is frequently attacked for her lifestyle while being the sort of person who does not return insult with insult, Binoche is reduced in many scenes to a kind of tolerant, slightly superior, patient smile that becomes wearying. It is only when Johnny Depp appears that we see the real Juliette Binoche and a true indication of her ability. Incidentally Depp is excellent as a gypsy musician who understands himself and his place as a counter balance to a conservative society. He is an inspiration to Vianne because he alone is not transparent to her; she only discovers his favorite chocolate by happenstance after two wrong guesses. Depp also serves to save this film from the near monotony of inadequate males and dissatisfied females. When he appears I can almost hear the audience sigh.Incidentally, you might want to compare this to Babette's Feast (1987) in which the narrow-minded and in need of liberation are northern Protestants, while the woman with the tempting goodies is an exiled Catholic chef from France. If Hallstrom had taken a clue from Gabriel Axel, who directed Babette's Feast, and followed a more objective and balanced treatment, Chocolat might have been a great movie. As it is, it is a very interesting one, and one you're not likely to forget or to feel neutral about.

Alas! Alas! It is the season of Lent and no parishioner should be tempted by such delicious trifles. It is the work of the devil, thinks the mayor, and he accuses Vienne and threatens her.

I don't know why Johnny Depp undertook such a small role as a guitar-playing itinerant.

The result is that poor sweets are regarded too highly and good sweets not highly enough.  Chocolat is not perfect, but it's one of the better sweets - and it's most emphatically NOT, as some would have it, too sweet.  A level of sweetness that would make coffee undrinkable and custard sickly is just right for chocolate, and a level of sweetness that would (or ought) make us gag if we encountered it in a story about precocious children or a family reunion is just right here.  There ARE bitter elements - wife-beating, prejudice and so forth - and the reason the film works so well is that it does not, even inadvertently, cast a sentimental glow over things that do not deserve it; the sweetness OFFSETS (or overcomes) the bitterness, and doesn't merely clash with it.Well acted, and if one or two things are contrived, at least they aren't contrived in such a way as to insult our intelligence (the film is smarter than you think it will be; it realises that stupidity is NOT sweet, whatever else is).

Best of all though is Juliette Binoche. Seldom do we see such a sensual performance in a PG-13 film. She becomes the character, which remains a complex enigma at the heart of the story. Is she a half-Mayan witch? Or just a French single mother in 1960, in a world on the cusp of the Beatles and the 60's revolution? She is at once elemental goddess Earth mother and toasty bed warmer we all desire. Female messiah figures are rare, and hers is a treasure. Not only a great movie, but an important story.

It has everything you could ask for of a romantic comedy... gentle, yet uncompromising heroines, crotchety yet kind-hearted old women and troubled yet hopeful wives. Those women are brilliantly portrayed by Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench and Lena Olin. They and the rest of the cast guided by Lasse Halstrom's gifted storytelling spin a captivating and delicious tale destined to be a great classic someday. Composer Rachel Portman (of EMMA and THE CIDER HOUSE RULES fame) wrote a perfectly spellbinding score and the script is a kaleidoscope of witty dialogue, unassuming subplots and the narrative is entirely genuine. Johnny Depp, Alfred Molina, Carrie Ann Moss, Victoire Thivisol and the great Leslie Caron round out the principle cast to perfection. The novel by Joanne Harris is a little different but the the film still is a very entertaining, original piece of art.

I didn't get a chance to see it before the awards were presented.  When none of the awards materialized, I lost interest in seeing it.  About a year later, I rented it and discovered why it is a good, but not great movie.  The antagonist is more memorable than the protagonist.Yes, Vianne, the proprietor of the chocolate shop, is strikingly beautiful and she is the one who moves the plot along, but it is Alfred Molina as the mayor of the tiny town in the south of France whom I remember most.He tries to keep his town faithful to God and is not interested in anyone stirring things up.  He is the epitome of the religious and business establishment in the town.  When the town gets a new priest, the mayor takes the new priest under his wing, even writing homilies that best suit the style of the town.  Unlike many establishment figures in other movies that celebrate individuality, the mayor is not scripted as a hypocrite or a fascist.  He desperately wants the town to be as faithful to God as he is. He shows his piety throughout the movie such as private fasting through the season of Lent.  In the end, it is the priest who points out to the mayor and others that deprivation and fasting is not the exclusive path to God.Although several other characters, including Vianne herself, make transformations through the course of the movie, their changes seem bland or overused (e.g., the doormat wife becomes an independent person).  The excellent transformation of the mayor rescues this from bring a beautiful but dull film to being a beautiful and good, but not great film.

Some terrible directorial choices is the answer(1) chosing English for a film set in a French village. The film just does not sound right in English the images one associates with the words call up English towns, English preachers, English landlords, English food and English customs. If you want to use English, why not locate the tale in say Catholic Ireland. (2) lack of originality once Johnny Depp has introduced a parallel to the notion of a stranger upsetting the conservative patterns of a village, merely to provide a romantic backdrop for Juliette, everything not only becomes preachy but also quite predictable. The final scene with a whole village celebrating Easter together with vagabonds and gypsies is banal in the extreme and so is the priest's message of tolerance, however praiseworthy in itself.

This genre is extremely difficult to do well, because of course what we enjoy most about food---its smell and taste---is conspicuously absent from the purely visual and auditory experience of film. (I am not talking here about the related genre, Movies With Food In Them, such as My Dinner With Andre.) Chocolat naturally brings to mind other well-known Movies About Food Babette's Feast, and especially Like Water For Chocolate. Like those other films, it is visually accomplished and features gifted actors. Chocolat, however, was strangely unsatisfying, and the reason for me is primarily the characterization of the main character, Vianne, played by the luscious Juliette Binoche. As I see it, the film failed to define her character consistently. In the other two films mentioned, the key character---Tita in LWFC and Babette in BF---is clearly defined and strongly characterized. There is nothing overtly supernatural in BF, while there is in LWFC; the magical properties of Tita's cooking flow directly from her life and experiences. In Chocolat, Vianne is deliberately intended to be mysterious. She has the gift of making chocolates that are not merely perfectly suited for her clientele, but which in fact are liberating They are vehicles, agents, catalysts, that unlock repressed and suppressed needs, desires, and impulses in the people who consume them. By extension, Vianne's role is that of a vehicle, agent or catalyst; her role has a shamanic quality, that of witchcraft or voodoo. But to be that successfully, she must be more of a reflection of her customers; she must be, so to speak, more of a cipher, a mirror in which her clientele see themselves. As such, there must be a certain detachment and otherworldliness in her character. But there is not Vianne is revealed to be an ordinary women, albeit with extraordinary gifts; but that woman is never more than a brilliantly colored sketch, never really fleshed out. The cloak of mystery is drawn aside, but the character behind the cloak never achieves fullness, as the film LWFC succeeded in doing with Tita. On a more ordinary note, I also was mystified as to why Johnny Depp, playing a gypsy in the French countryside, affected what sounded like an Irish accent. So I rate Chocolat as an entertaining film (they should publish a chocolate cookbook based on those recipes), but inferior to other Movies About Food. "},{"Title":"Almost Perfect.

It is a delectable mixture of The Scarlet Letter and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  The message is a good balanced exhortation toward goodness and commitment without legalism and rigidity.  I think we can't go around measuring our goodness by what we don't do, it reminds.    The initially mysterious, fairy tale feel is Burtonesque (Edward Scissorhands).  Even when the mysterious element is eventually unveiled and the strange stranger turns out to be little more than a nice lady who likes to travel, we are not let down.  Juliette Binoche is delightful and her best attribute is that even she doesn't have it all figured out.  Her change of heart in the movie keeps it from being sappy.  Peter Stormare (Fargo, Jurassic Park 2), as Serge, is an interesting character as well.  It's a shame he is disposed of and never to be seen again.  Though hardly likable, he was an interesting character and I felt he deserved a little bit more attention. Finally, though I'm a big Johnny Depp fan, I didn't think his character was particularly memorable.  Even this has its benefits, however.  Not only does Depp have the guts to be in some pretty quirky movies but he doesn't have to steal the show every time, either.  We already know he's good.And one last thing that must be said.  I did find Chocolat to be agonizingly slow.  Perhaps this is just me.  I still enjoyed it but (as with a good but over-long church service) checked my watch a lot.I think you will enjoy it, however.

The Hollywood production is best described as a sweet delicacy for those moviegoers craving light fare.  I didn't buy the fairytale framing device that the film's director wanted to give it but I withhold any specific negative criticism on that particular count since I haven't read the novel the script was based on.  It just seemed to be kind of part of a collage-technique that wasn't fully effective, in my opinion.  CHOCOLAT's screenplay (based on Joanne Harris' novel) was, without a doubt, in a league far less worthy than that of the OSCAR-winner, Traffic (Stephen Gaghan who adapted teleplays, Traffick).   Speaking of movies I can unabashedly recommend to the general moviegoing public, I do want to pay credit to another USER COMMENT below (Mort-31, 4 August 2000) for reminding me of a much better (nutritious in the literal and allegorical senses) Best Picture (Foreign Film category) of a few years back BABETTE's FEAST.  I encourage IMDB browsers to rent the two European, general audience appealing-films together and then notice how you rate this happily conceived film from your video stores on the basis of worthy comparison.  Still, I would advise those who sample CHOCOLAT not to bring too many high-brow demands given its airy, flimsy thesis once the cellophane has been unwrapped from around its bright packaging.  It's a good film for snuggling and taking your brain out to relax. This candy box has giddy, happy little devices and is thoroughly restrained in contrast to most mainstream recent films in its depiction of the aphrodisiac quality inherent in the blend of cacao plus hot pepper.  It does affirm the benefit that outsiders can bring to stifled and stifling communities.  Therefore, it provides a helpful parable to many insulated American enclaves.  However, other movies have also addressed such fish out of water projects . . .Or was the film intended to enlighten American Francophobes that there are lots of adorable French folks in little villages?  If that underlies the positive angle for this movie for any potential video renter,  try the real thing when you next seek a video from the store  a movie in French language with real French actors from lead actress throughout the cast, not this happy unsorted box of folks who for the biggest part just act French-like or homogenized European in their accents.

But just as the winds blow in the seeds that can take root and ultimately reclaim structures that have become crystalized (I'm thinking, for example, of how the jungle in Cambodia completely overtook the abandoned temple of Angor Wat), the revitilizing spirit of Veanne blows into an insular French village and sends tendrils of sensual pleasure into the lives of the people, breaking apart completely the stone and mortar that had been keeping the spirits of the villagers in a Dark Age prison.Just like when men get together to drink beer or housewives attend a kaffeklache (I have no idea how to spell it), it is the klache that is the point, not the kaffe; chocolate was the enticement and the bonding agent for the much-needed revitalized human relationships that the chocolate, in the expert hands of its practitioner, Veanne, could engender. And what an enticement the chocolate was, with its deep powers that almost seem like magic, yet the true magic was the spirit and heart of Veanne who dispensed the chocolate like a prescription and was following a mysterious thread of nature and a spiritual commitment to bring with the wind these seeds of healing.  This is your favorite, Veanne would say, secure in her ability to see the cherished desires that resided hidden in each person's heart.  And in her hands, this was like a Tibeten prayer and a greeting I recognize and salute the greatness that is within you.  Only with the fluid complexity of Roux, Veanne's love interest who was also an unsettled spirit like her, was it harder to uncover or to realize what was the dream in both of their hearts, to find out what was his favorite.  I know with names like Roux (a complex blending of flavors) and the Compte de Reynard (a fox), there was some hidden communication in the marvelous names that makes me regret that I don't know French better.Veanne is like an elemental plant spirit; she carried on her journeys practically no possessions, and yet, upon alighting on fertile ground, some imprint within her would react with the soil and environmental elements to produce seemingly from nowhere a complete and beautiful chocolate shop overflowing with preColumbian artifacts and an infinite variety of chocolate treats in every shape of candy, drink, cake, or other form imaginable--indeed, a veritable jungle of chocolate emerging from out of only two seed-pod suitcases.One amazing and ironic undercurrent in the film's battle between Catholic morality and the natural, perhaps pagan pleasures was symbolized by the chocolate itself.  Chocolate did not exist in Europe prior to the discovery of the New World in 1492.  It was one of the many transformative agricultural products discovered and brought back to the Old World as a result of the Spanish invasions that intended to plunder gold and Catholicize the native inhabitants.  Here, now, the chocolate comes in like a form of Montezuma's revenge, invading a Catholic stronghold to retake the natural spirit and, as a form of commerce, get THEIR gold--the chocolate shop was a business, after all.  So, what goes around, comes around, as the North Wind might say.Among all the beautiful details in this movie, and the movie was as much of a visual a feast as the chocolate that was in the shop, one of my favorites was the fascinating color of Veanne's hair, which I can only describe as chocolate mixed with chili peppers, a rich, delicious brown mixed with red.  Whoever was the design genius who came up with that exact shade of hair dye deserves a special award--she or he captured completely the flavored essence of the story.  Hair artificially colored for vanity, a work of the devil, for sure, reflective of the energetic, fiery overtones lying in wait among the sweet allure of the chocolate itself.  Without even knowing what Veanne was about, the Mayor probably took one look at her and immediately began to sweat.  Heat and fecund passions arose in him that only the cold shower of abstinence could combat. Is this a battle he could win? Chocolate...who can resist it?

'Chocolat' is a fun fable about a free-spirited woman named Vianne (played by Juliette Binoche), who travels wherever the north wind takes her in order to heal the troubled souls she meets up with. Her cure? Chocolate. This time, the sly wind has brought Vianne and her young daughter to a small town in rural France. The mayor of this town, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), is the latest in a long line of moral-compass types to watch over the village and its traditions. He is not bad or evil; he simply strives to preserve tranquility- but unfortunately for those who have to live there, the town's tradition of tranquility has become little more than suppression. When Vianne shows up with her aura of warm sensuality the mayor sees her as a threat, so she must strive to prove to him and those like him that there is more to live than pointless self-denial. Juliette Binoche is both a presence and a timeless beauty; she will be beautiful at 70 because it exudes from both her face and her spirit. It's really no wonder the entire town reacts so strongly to her character. Also on hand is another warm, beautiful woman Judi Dench (who is already nearly 70) plays Vianne's landlady and friend, Armande. Lena Olin is another strong character- Josephine, at first a beaten wife and klepto, then transformed into a spirited young business woman. Johnny Depp is Roux, a handsome river-rat whose arrival is the catalyst for the film's climax. All of these characters will face temptation- the chocolate Vianne makes is an obvious metaphor. In this fable, however, temptation is not a bad thing. It's what makes life worth living.

It was especially fun seeing one of my favorites from movies past, Leslie Caron, in a small role. Juliette Binoche was perfect as Vianne, the wanderer who brought her daughter and chocolate, with all its mysteries and powers, to this small French town. My favorite, though, was Alfred Molina as the mayor, who tries in vain to keep his tiny community on the straight and narrow. I also enjoyed Johnny Depp as Roux, the Irish boat gypsy.Before Vianne shows up, at the beginning of Lent in 1959, the small town is a closely-knit community where everyone goes to church, and everyone observes the traditions of giving up enjoyments for lent. The mayor see to it. He is also the peacemaker, at one point forcing a man to go to confession after striking his wife, and later exiling the same man after he burned the boat of the gypsies. His assistant (Carrie-Ann Moss) is estranged from her diabetic mother (Judi Dench).Vianne is the devil. She does not go to church, but likes to hear the bells. The bells are not for entertainment. They are a solemn part of our worship, the mayor tells her. She tempts the townsfolk with her chocolates, even though they believe they should abstain. Her example empowers a mistreated wife to leave her husband. She facilitates a reconciliation between mother, daughter, and grandson. In a well-done scene near the end, the mayor breaks into her shop, to destroy all the chocolates, but when a tiny piece flies onto his lips, and his tongue reaches out to savor it, he loses it and binges on chocolate, and is discovered the next morning sleeping in the display window.The film is very entertaining, but does have a thread of meanness. It makes light of the fact that some people have deeply-held views that another person can change willy-nilly just because they don't agree. Thus, what is presented as a liberation of the small town, which in fact it is, comes at least at some sacrifice. In the end, when the young priest delivers the Easter homily, he says they should focus on what they do to include others, not what they do to exclude tempations, including others. In a sense, a Pleasantville type of transformation has occurred, and everyone in the small French town, including the rigid mayor, are better of for it.The DVD has some interesting extras, the best being the making of special.

But, rest assured, the film ends up not attacking religion - merely redefining its terms.The lovely and radiant Juliette Binoche stars as Vianne, a young unwed mother, who, with her charming daughter, enters a small, morally uptight French village in 1959.  There, much to the dismay of the rigid and intolerant Roman Catholic mayor, she sets up a chocolateri, during Lent of all times, and proceeds to dispense confections that (as in `Like Water For Chocolate') seem to exert a magical influence on the villagers who partake of them.  The chocolate is, of course, a muted metaphor for the eternal conflict that has been waged throughout history between those who view sensual pleasures as `sins' and those who see them as natural and morally neutral human desires.  The film certainly comes out foursquare in favor of the latter view, showing the dangers that can result when people become obsessed with repressing their basic human needs and end up isolating those who believe, think or live differently.  Vianne, and those who rally to her cause, are viewed as warm and loving free spirits, placed in stark contrast to the mayor and his minions who appear as crabbed, morose and intolerant cretins.But `Chocolat' is less impressive for the story it tells than for the magical mood it weaves thanks to its charming setting, its spirit of sly fun and, above all, the radiance of Binoche, who demonstrates once again that she was truly made for the camera.  Despite the rather bizarre clash of accents that results, the film utilizes a vast international cast that includes American Johnny Depp, British Judi Dench, and French Leslie Caron. Like many of the rural French comedies on which it appears to be patterning itself, `Chocolat' seems, at times, as artificial and lightweight as the truffles it features.  Yet, even though its message is not exactly original and radical, in this day and age when many religions seem to measure their closeness to God based on how many rules they can make for us to follow and how many groups of people they can manage to keep on the outside, it is nice to be reminded that the purpose of religion is to gather people together into a circle of common humanity.  And what better meeting ground than the one truly universal desire we all do share  our unabashed and undying love for chocolate?

The story of one person stirring up a whole town is not new the Oscar-winning Danish movie &#132;Babette's gæstebud` was one of the first movies that wanted nothing more than to TASTE (and did quite well). It's also true that only Hollywood can happily ignore the hurting illogicality of a French actress speaking English with a French accent to English speaking American actors who impersonate Frenchmen in the middle of France.But it's also true that I was sitting in the theater for two hours and was perfectly entertained. I got carried away by a dense story taking place at only one scene &#150; a lovely (or well photographed) little village. Lasse Hallström may not be the most sophisticated director in Hollywood but he can create an atmosphere and catch the audience for exactly the time they are watching his film not more and not less he's Hollwood! The convincing performance of Juliette Binoche and the appearance of old lady Dame Judi Dench strengthen the positive feeling.I would not have nominated the movie for Best Picture. I wouldn't use it as an &#132;appetizer` either because there is a little too much chocolate (on the meat!) inside. I would suggest just to watch it (if you don't know what else to watch, or if you prefer a quiet, melancholic, humorous night) and enjoy it. 7 out of 10.

I took a long time to decide to see it but when I finally did I was glad I chose it over Evolution or Tomb raider. Knowing what I know now it really was never a contest. I am a pretty big fan of Juliet Binoche (who isn't) and I've liked her in every movie I've seen her in. Most of the time though she is speaking ?French though but this time she's speaking English. She really does everything in this movie well but its not only her in it of course. All the other characters are very well played. I can't think of one exception with the stand-out performers being, IMHO the Mayor and Serge' wife as well as the little girl. The movie did not really have any huge incredible highlights it just did everything very very well and was consistent. It also held you very well. Plenty happened in that 2 hours but the pace is just right. The story was very good and well written I enjoyed it and found it to be mostly real. Then there was the chocolate. Really if there was one unbelievable thing in the film it was the effect that Juliet' chocolate had on everyone. WOW I mean it was hilarious watching more and more people fall into total dependence on this stuff after only one crumb. But hey they were sceptical to. I also enjoyed Johnny Depp although he comes on in the later part of the film he still gets plenty of time and I think besides his occasionally off accent was pretty good. I saw it on the big screen which was lucky. On DVD or Video it would still be worth a watch. Go see it.

So mama tells it before sleep. It's almost an Indian fairy tale in which the special chocolate formula that grandpa drinks as a treat makes him fall for the beautiful Maya, Chitza, the grandma. They happily marry, have a daughter, and then the North Wind takes her away. She's out traveling the world, bringing people happiness together with the special Maya chocolate formula. And so the tradition goes on...Now, Vianne has hit the roads with her own daughter, and with Pantoufle of course. And she tells the story about grandma and grandpa almost every night before Anouk falls asleep, peacefully in her bed.And then comes the story we as audiences are being told by Anouk, the daughter in the story itself. That is the story of a woman settling in a small ''tranquille'' French village with her daughter, struggling to achieve her traditional mission as to blow life into those people who are too narrow minded to see, and to live. And that will all be achieved through that superbly delicious treat Chocolate. All forms, all kinds of chocolate. Chocolate with pepper, with orange, chocolate sauce on turkey...Attention before you go further Possible spoiler! The end Mission accomplished. Everyone dancing happily, everyone is free, emotions are free, and it is settling time...And so happy is our friend Pantoufle, hopping happily along the streets. Grandma Chitza is contented with her daughter's decision to stay, and Roux returns... No one could ever come up with a happier ending.You realize, this film itself, I mean the story as told by Anouk, was also like a fairy tale. Probably Anouk was telling the story to her own sons/daughters before bed, as the story of their grannies. In fairy tales there is always the happy ending, and so does this story end.With beautiful scenery, almost like out of an illustrated fairy tale book, dreamy-like atmosphere, and colorful characters, this film was a great pleasure to watch, from start to finish. I bursted out laughing in most scenes, the humor was used so cleverly too. Acting was great, cast was full of experienced actors and actresses. And of course, direction is immensely successful. Music is used very effectively, also.Looking at the film poster, I thought this movie was more a romantic one, but after having watched it, I now see that it is everything. It is about life, it is about being human, it is about humanity.A 10/10 for me. By the way, what is your favorite?

It reminded me a lot of Babette's feast which is a good thing. It brings up the age old battle of indulgence versus self-control. Complete indulgence seemed to lead the characters down a path of joyous release. I think this is a fine ideal, but hardly realistic. Moderation is always the better road to follow. I think Babette's feast did a better job of capturing the fear that their character's had of letting themselves go. The difference between the two movies was that the denial of worldly pleasures was self-imposed in BF where in chocolat it was imposed by the Count and his presence and grip over the community. It also had elements of the supernatural, very subtle, but enough to add a touch of magic to make it special. In this I am sure the comparison with Like Water for Chocolate will be made. It was it's own story though. The message at the end was was one I wished more people would get. It's by what we do that makes us good or evil, not what we deny or allow ourselves.

At first it seems a contrast between so-called good Christians and the simply good; between God-fearing and God-loving (altho' not expressed in that way).  The more I think about it (and see it!) Vianne is a God figure - she never utters a disparaging word about another. even when angry;  she takes a wait-and-see attitude (in response to Josephine's statement that Serge rules the world,  she says, `Perhaps you are right.  My mistake.').  Vianne is certainly open to the movement of the spirit(s)  the clever wind and Armande.  In the end EVERYONE is redeemed, with the possible exception of Serge, changed by love, compassion, generosity. and understanding.  Vianne possesses whatever it takes to change people for the better.  Everyone receives what s/he needs  chocolate sea shells for Madame Audel, cocoa nuts for the Jean-Marc. Jean-Marc's passion, not only for his wife but for life, is re-ignited. She even frees herself after following what she believes is her destiny; Vianne utterly abandons her drive to move on.  She remains true to herself throughout.  Vianne is open and accepting of her daughter Anouk's imaginary kangaroo, Bantouf;  recognizing Anouk's need for something permanent to cling to just as  Vianne clings to her mother's ashes; Vianne also in allows Anouk's feelings - `I hate you!' `You're entitled, now come.'   The good-hearted but weak young priest, Pere Henri, has good instincts and Jesus' example before him but lets himself be overwhelmed by the Comte.  We get hints of his free and open spirit when he sings Hound Dog.   Roux and his band of `river rats' represents a big threat to the complacent, tranquil (translate in-a-box) way of life.  `If you become friends with us, you make enemies of others.'  He is free of worldly attachments and instinctively knows what is really important.  `(the boat) is only a way of getting from place to place.'  Implicit in this is his understanding there are many ways to get from place to place. Armande  manifests freedom despite the disapproval and alienation of her own daughter.  The villagers and the Comte seem to find Armande eccentric but harmless.  It is her dying that ultimately brings Caroline, her daughter around.  Armande embraces life even when it means losing it.    The change in Caroline is prefigured when she witnesses her mother, Armande, and her son, Luc, dancing on the boat.    Luc, being young, expresses his own form of freedom in his drawings.  I wondered why Caroline never objected to the drawings but perhaps she thought it was a way Luc was grieving the loss of his father. His grandmother, Armande, is a kindred spirit and shares much of the unspoken with the boy.  Luc is open to risk as he demonstrates in going to the chocolaterie for the portrait and chocolate sessions.  Armande brings out in him what is already there.  `Forget the 'supposed to's'   The comte is not evil.  He merely lives as he thinks he should (like the Zealot St. Paul?) straight and narrow, bound by all his own strictures  traditions, expectations, sense of duty, etc. Yet, like St. Paul, he comes around.  Comte de Reynaud has his own brand of integrity.   Guillaume is encouraged to pursue his love, Madame Audel. even given his advanced years and hers (never too late).  Age does not quench hope and desire. Josephine becomes completely transformed and totally rejects her former world view formed by cultural and religious conditioning.  Josephine confronts her deepest fear in leaving Serge.  She is able to accept his apology but cannot forget.  Without genuine contrition on the part of Serge not even the strongest efforts on the part of the Comte can change him. Once Josephine `gets it' she knows her own deepest reality and does not allow herself to be defined by others.  Notice even the changes in her facial expressions and body movement.   Stereotypical village mentality, present everywhere, capable of change but reluctant to embrace it.

I found it to be rather more serious than that. In fact, the setting in France is fairly incidental, and the film is about some basic social and ethical issues, involving tolerance and hypocrisy, at a period, the 1950s, when such issues were being actively addressed in western society, and old conventional frameworks were beginning to crumble.The movie (and the book) might have tackled this theme via a realistic drama or satirical comedy, but decided to choose the mode of a fable. The audience is left in no doubt about this, as it is signalled right at the outset when the wind, almost literally, blows confectioner Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) and her daughter into town, and we flash back to her mystical origins.  I don't expect fully rounded characters in fables (especially when they avoid chocolate!), so was not offended by the fairly stereotypical collection of villagers - though they are not much more stereotypical here than in most Hollywood pictures. Much of the charm of the film is due to Binoche, whose character is not as restricted as the others, because she has a psychological depth that comes from not blindly following imposed conventions, but trying to make your own choices (and from eating chocolate!) Judi Dench as an embittered pensioner with a colourful past, and Lena Olin as a beaten wife sheltered by Vianne, fulfil their roles with merit. I am less sure about Johnny Depp, who plays a kind of gypsy (as in The Man who Cried) for some reason with an Irish accent, though his character, Roux, has a French name. (Perhaps he was allowed to get away with it because the director, Lasse Hallstrom, a Swede, didn't realise it was Irish.)The real stars are none of the above, but the irresistible, mouthwatering  chocolates that appear in all shapes and sizes throughout the film.

When you're watching the film in the cineplex or wherever, the individual screen is adjusted so that the black borders mask the top and bottom of the frame when it is projected and things like boom mikes and lights are hidden.  Or, the projector itself might mask it.  Or both.

Take a best selling book with a strong story line and good characterisation, assemble an excellent cast and produce something which is just mawkish drivel. Changing the story so that there is the obligatory happy ending is just silly.The central character is supposed to be sexy, exotic and mysterious. Any film which can cast Juliette Binoche in this role and make her look boring has really achieved something. This is a woman who looks absolutely stunning in a baggy sweatshirt & jeans. Someone should tell the director that putting an attractive woman in a low cut dress with an uplift bra does not make her look sexy.I thought the camera work was poor, there was no sense of place and no feeling of living in a closed, tightknit community. The fact that the producers have added an annoying voiceover to tell you what is supposed to be happening indicates that they must have realised that they'd failed. It's a shame because with a better script and stronger direction it could have been very good.

The film has a few weighty elements in the storyline but they are so sublimated into the main theme that there is very little left except some nice, easily digestible entertainment.

Starring Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Lena Olin, Johnny Depp, Carrie Anne-Moss.It was February 13 when the Oscar nominees were announced. As I was at school, I had to tape it. As it happens in every year, I was waiting anxiously for them and had a slight idea of what and who would be nominated. But in any moment I imagined that CHOCOLAT would receive 5 Oscar nominations, including best picture. I was too silly to think that the Miramax lobby wouldn't work, but I really had no idea. First of all, I became a bit angry. ALMOST FAMOUS is being released in Brazil only next week, so I still haven't seen it, but everyone who watched it liked and that's the kind of film that I appreciate. I'm sure it's better than CHOCOLAT, but these things happen. Many other great movies were forgotten (DANCER IN THE DARK, AMERICAN PSYCHO, THE VIRGIN SUICIDES, QUILLS, CHICKEN RUN, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM...)  but the truth is that CHOCOLAT isn't bad at all. For sure it didn't deserve the nomination for best picture, even if 2000 was a very weak year for cinema, but it is a very fine film indeed.CHOCOLAT is a kind of triumph of clichés. There are plenty of them, but they are so well used that the film becomes adorable. In another time, it would mean everything I always defeat in movies, but not now. The story brings nothing new a stranger arrives in a small village just to change everyone's life in the place. In this case, the stranger is a woman named Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), who arrives in a French village with her daughter Anouk (BTW, the girl of the wonderful French film PONETTE) and rents a building from a grumpy old woman, Armande (Judi Dench). She opens a chocolate shop, as she can prepare any kind of them as none. The problem is that it is Lent time and they are at a Catholic town. She doesn't go to church, so soon the mayor of the town, the Count of Reynard (Alfred Molina) sets up a big trouble with her. The majority of the inhabitants stay against her, with the exception of some few, including Armande, who doesn't talk to her daughter (Carrie Anne Moss), and Josephine Muscat (Lena Olin), a woman considered nuts who suffers with a violent husband (Peter Stormare). Vianne's situation will change, for better or worse, when an Irish gypsy named Roux (Johnny Depp) arrives. It's basically a story about the tradition against the innovating habits, but it works better as an enchanting fable about our desires and temptations, with some very peculiar characters (the daughter who sees a kangaroo, the old woman who used to swim naked on the river, the mayor who still waits for his wife who left him and can't invite his secretary to go out, the middle-aged couple who finds desire again). There are some very funny moments and lines and a story that keeps our interest during the whole film. I haven't read the book, but I believe the screenplay writer followed it faithfully.Swedish director Lasse Hallström comes back only one year after his awarded THE CIDER HOUSE RULES, that had more dramatic power. He uses the same style here, doing a great job. No complaints. The cinematography and the sets help you to get into the climate of a fable, not to talk about the wonderful soundtrack.I've expected many years to see Juliette Binoche in action again after THE ENGLISH PATIENT and now it's rewarding to see that she's still a great actress. She is pretty, funny and can bring emotion to a character like few other actresses. Judi Dench deserved her nomination for best supporting actress. The funniest lines belong to her. Lena Olin is terrific and she shouldn't have disappeared the way she did- I still remember her astonishing performance in THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, which also starred Binoche. As for the others, Alfred Molina, Peter Stormare and Carrie Anne Moss are effective, and Johnny Depp seems to be just window dressing.Even not being the best film of the world, I can recommend CHOCOLAT. It's a light, beautiful, lovely, feel-good, easy to watch, unpretentious film, with a bit of  romance and a bit of magic that will make your day happy. It's not unforgettable, the story is predictable and the clichés are all around but you'll want to run to a chocolate shop as the ending credits roll. Anyway, isn't chocolate irresistible? And CHOCOLAT, even not being irresistible as chocolate, is a delight to watch.

Johnny Depp I quite like, and he does come across in a very likeable manner in this.  However, I found their romance a little off the mark, with the true romance between two other characters never really given a chance until a brief narration made at the very end of the film.

Other townspeople,including an abused wife who takes up with her, also add great color to the film. Johnny Depp arrives halfway through the movie as a 'river rat' to also add to the mayor's consternation. Much of this,of course, is a little predictable and the ending comes as no great surprise.

I liked Alfred Molina as the Comte, but that was just good acting (Judy Dench  also put in a convincing portrayal as  Juliette's embittered land lady).

In a picturesque hilltop village in France, a Pagan mother and daughter (Juliette Binoche and Victoire Thivisole) arrive to setup a chocolate shop. The chocolate is capable of altering the townsfolks limited view on life, as they begin to indulge in suppressed desires. Fashioning the story as a cross between Pleasantville and Mary Poppins, director Lasse Hallstrom casts a light spell that usually keeps the material afloat. But as soon as Johnny Depp enters the picture as one of the unfairly persecuted River Rats, Chocolat becomes absurdly condescending in its tolerance message.

A favorite confection of many. A passion for some. It seems to represent something a little different to each person, as this movie shows with rather delightful results.Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is a born wanderer. We see this as she recounts the tale of how her parents met to her daughter, Anouk (Victoire Thivisol). Early one spring, her wandering takes her to a small village in the French countryside, where she opens a chocolate shop. Unfortunately for Vianne, she has arrived during Lent, and the Comte de Reynard (Alfred Molina), who pretty much runs the town, has declared chocolate off limits for the Lenten season. Undeterred, Vianne sells her wares to the villagers, most of whom are soon won over by her compassion and kindness. In the process, she becomes involved in helping an abused wife (Lena Olin) out of her horrible marriage, bringing a shy elderly couple together, and reuniting a grandmother, Amande (Judi Dench) with her estranged grandson, Luc (Aurelian Parent Koenig), whose mother Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss), secretary to the Comte, has forbidden the boy from seeing his grandmother. When a band of river gypsies led by Roux (Johnny Depp)comes to town, Vianne immediately befriends them, while the Comte declares them off limits. A violent act by an overzealous villager helps to set off a chain of events which leads the Comte to soften his stance, and eventually befriend Vianne.The writing is brilliant, weaving together subplots artfully, and creating characters that you care about. Even the villains have their humanity, while there are moments when Vianne herself is not overly sympathetic. In the end, all are presented as people, with their faults as well as their strengths.The acting is delightful. Binoche is an incredible talent, as her portrayal sows. Depp also does well here, and his chemistry with Binoche is wonderful. Dench gives her usual excellent performance. Parent Koenig does a wonderful job with his role, as does Thivisol with hers. Moss creates a wonderfully complex character, whose humanity and kindness become ever more clear as the movie goes along. Likewise with Molina, whose pompousness is a bit off-putting in the beginning, but whose transformation is delightful, as we begin to sympathize with his plight. Leslie Caron's cameo is charming. Perhaps the standout performance is Olin's however, as she goes from victim to fully developed woman in a most satisfying arc.And of course, there's the chocolate, which shows up so much throughout the movie that it almost seems to be a character of its own. You long for a morsel as you watch, and you can almost feel the satisfaction of those who eat and enjoy the chocolate.This is a delightful movie, well worth revisiting from time to time.

Its absolute predictability counts against it, as does its refusal to pass up any opportunity for sentimentalism.  Ironically, however, its weaknesses protect it from more damaging assertions of tubthumping anti-religion, for example, which a less cliche-ridden movie would certainly have been guilty of.  Certainly its source material is culpable in this way.The crucial issue here is simple.  It is the duty of these sorts of films to go against the grain.  Take Mary Poppins, a vastly superior film which is based on the same conceptual principles.  An unorthodox influence breezes into town, helps the repressed and the stuffy liberate themselves and finally moves on, her work done.In 1964 many of its tenets were still more or less controversial.  Children were still expected in many places to be seen and not heard.  Fantasy was frowned upon.  Class structures were rigid enough for it to be outrageous for an itinerant (however respectable-seeming) to encourage rich and privileged children to associate with the worst element (a chimney sweep) and loiter about feeding pigeons etc.  Most of all, though, Mary Poppins' message is profoundly anti-materialist.  The children, and the family, are encouraged to see that money is not the most important thing.Chocolat never once steps outside of the received wisdom, the prevailing ideology of 2000 in this way.  Sure, in the small town in France, self-indulgence and consumerism is frowned upon, particularly in Lent, where people are supposed to be denying themselves what they like to show their love for God and their sympathy for Christ's suffering.But in the world we live in now, Juliette Binoche's preaching is precisely 'on message'.  Why abstain?  You KNOW you want it!  Buy our little delicious treats!  Indulge yourself.  Spend money.  God won't mind.  Love one another - but not 'bad men' like Serge.  No.  Don't love him.  Hey, why not lust after one another too?  No harm in that!  Be decadent, have fun.  And don't forget... spend, spend, spend.  It's a good job everyone's got so much money isn't it?  Not just Binoche who can afford to set up a failed business from scratch every few months/years, but also the local people who can throw parties and afford luxuries like there's no tomorrow and the river rats whose economy seems to thrive despite their supposed universal exclusion.They used to make movies where people with a sense of morality moved into decadent micro-societies and made them see that rampant self-indulgence and self-interest were ultimately not as satisfying as living your life with a sense of duty to each other and a higher power - a sense of duty that sometimes meant self-sacrifice.They don't make too many movies like that any more.Chocolate?  Only £4.50.  And it won't make you fat! "},{"Title":"Binoche the Saviour.

The Pere, Hugh O' Conor, is afraid to say boo, and hides in the town mayor's shadow(Alfred Molina), until the end when he preaches about Christ's humanity and tolerance. Yes, he was very tolerant to the Pharisees and the moneylenders. The Christians of the town were also shown as needing to be rescued from their closemindedness by Binoche, finally refuting all semblance of decorum in a Mardi Gras style celebration in one of the closing scenes. The Mayor,(Molina), who is the main property owner of the town and who basically runs the church, is a pompous radical who shuts down anything that does not fit into his idea of tranquillite Another disturbing thing is that the heroine becomes the heroine because of her openmindness and passion.

(but I will make an additional comment on this subject below.)  Somehow Chocolat left me unsatisfied.  It wasn't terrible, but it was hardly magical, despite striving to be.    Maybe my seat was uncomfortable, or I was restless, or guilty from playing hooky... but this show, though it had nice sets, great actors and nice scenery in a French gothic town, just was never able to win me over.  I really wanted to enjoy it, but some of the stuff was so forced.  It was simply not compelling.  For Hallstrom, this missed the 'judge not' theme of `Cider House Rules' by a wide margin.  The `Christ taught acceptance, not exclusion' theme in Chocolat was so heavy handed, it became tiresome.  In fact, if anyone is under siege from anyone, it is the Catholic Church from all the neopaganism that is so hip today in pop culture.  On the other hand, it is sad that anything that is considered 'occult' by the current standard is immediately met with opposition by the American bible belt.   Maybe the international cast of characters were having a hard time understanding the director or each other...  Again, I wouldn't dissuade you from seeing it, it just didn't work for me.  I love Juliette Binoche & the other actors.  Unfortunately, I just don't think this is their best.The girl who plays the daughter was the actress who played Ponnet.  (A film which I highly endorse, it is very worth seeing. Perhaps it is easier to be 'wrangled' as a baby/toddler than as a pre-teen.) Alfred Molina seems to be somewhat type-casted playing a similar character as Mellersh in Enchanted April, only somewhat more uptight.  Too bad.

I saw the Cider House Rules and thought it was one of the worst movies I've seen in several years, but I thought I'd give Hallestrom another chance.  Within a half hour it was clear that this film was the same random mix of plot devices without any consistency from scene to scene, sacrificing a consistent lighthearted tone in order to sprinkle in a few serious situations (domestic violence, etc) - I suppose because the director wants the film to seem important.  Yet even within the same scene, or a scene later the difficulties have been resolved.(warning, spoilers follow) The film is filled with silly plot inconsistencies, I suspect because the director is more concerned with plot devices and cheap audience emotional manipulation (certainly the case in cider house rules) than any kind of story with flow or unity.  One sees this in almost every scene - but a few examples 1) After the Lena Olin character is abused, the JB character starts philosophizing about her husband even though she's apparently spoken about 2 sentences to the guy.  2) questionable motivations are everywhere for instance, JB wants to leave her entire investment in chocolate tools and goods because of this north wind.  That would be acceptable if we knew more about this north wind, or the director had developed the story about her emotional attachment to it (but what can you do when you have 50 other stories to tell), but it seemed completely arbitrary and silly.At the very least, go to the matinee, don't pay full price for this movie.

They reassured me that it was an amazing film, and the title has some element of mystery/art house feel, like a foreign movie except in English. So I took up their half-remembered goadings and channeled that energy vaguely, yet meaningfully, into a late-night viewing session. That's right, this is the one where you expect the medium of film to keep you awake and forgetful of your responsibilites for the next day.And from beginning to the end I was reminded by every line of unconvincing, unmotivated dialogue of the vast amount of things, both important and unimportant, that comprised my early morning, now late-afternoonish, tasks. And yet I couldn't look away, because not unlike a hot tub that malfunctions in the middle of you're being in it, you keep waiting to see if it will kick up again no matter how cold you get and disappointed you get. I guess I kept waiting for Chocolat's talented cast to explain their presence in this film.They didn't, but if the writers had made lines for them to say how dissatisfied they were with the dialogue they were given, maybe we would have had some motivation from the characters. Instead the actors, Depp and Moss especially, look like they're struggling to find a way to express something unexpected through their lines. And in this film it's important to try at least, since the number of interactions the characters have with each other are as wildly disjointed as they are sparse. One minute people are meeting each other for the first time, then they spell out very carefully, as if from a Character Psychology for Dummies textbook, the main, deeply personal problems they face (problem in the singular is probably better for most of them), and how grateful they are to finally open up to their savior. And don't give me the 'the magical chocolate made them do it' thing. These characters are one dimensional regardless of whether or when they've eaten the stuff.But don't get me wrong. I'm not hating the movie for being something other than what it is. It's a kind of fairy tale, of course, and I love fairy tales, especially complicated ones of multiple meanings, even with a single narrator. A serious, dramatic fairy tale, however, where the difficulty and ambiguity of transformation doesn't exist because motivations are single-tiered and seemingly unalterable (until the script cues that the time for fundamental change is nigh), then the fairy tale fails. The characters are just there. You remain uninvested in them, they in each other and in themselves. You get the feeling that the challenge, the difficulty, even the joke happened sometime before or after you were watching.Of course, the movie has its wrong points, the few instances of violence, or danger, or desperation. But these are disjointed, and seem to be the beginnings, the hints of deeper conversations between characters rather than the end. Taken in context, they seem like lip service to character formation.I swear, the most promising and potentially transformative interactions are brought up and resolved in mere moments, leaving me thinking that at least the actors got some chocolate out of this movie.

I cannot say I am surprised at the anti-Catholic bias of secularist's with an agenda. This movie thwarts more than religion, it, as so many opinion pieces do nowadays, wants to show traditional life, morays, customs and attitudes as being provincial, narrow-minded and detrimental to the human condition and spirit. This movie goes on to place in high honor the iconoclast's role in reshaping and rectifying centuries of injustice and intolerance. It does this by making all the failings of the outsider - the iconoclast, virtuous qualities. The crude old lady (Judy Dench) who admits her daughter won't have anything to do with her because she drinks and swears and doesn't care what others think, or the main character (Juliette Binoche) who blows into town and promptly turns her nose up at local custom and then acts surprised when some modicum of resistance presents itself to her style, both refuse to recognize other people's sensibilities. This assault is later furthered by Johnny Depp's character, the noble vagabond, who, in his open-mindedness, simply asks Juliette Binoche why she cares what the narrow-minded villagers think. This brings me to what is what is most grating and at the same time predictable, the intransigence of all these noble spirits who muddle through, putting aside any effort to assimilate or acculturate and hold on to their own biases in the name of what they so selfishly perceive as open-mindedness. The movie promotes the nobility of breaking social morays and not being satisfied until people accept it. The story demands everyone find the newcomer or the outsider's way acceptable and further embrace it. And it also wants to show the sole defender of tradition as being an intolerant hypocrite who can manipulate a young priest by demanding he edit his sermons. So while this movie is decidedly anti-Catholic it is also patently anti-tradition and while the Church's values and customs are always ripe for fodder in Hollywood, I get the feeling the producers would be just as happy to ask me to accept and enjoy any other form of social deviance for my own good - like being served food by a kid with metal through her lips, nose and eyebrows while saying to myself Good for her! She's a real individual! And while I have no use for the story or the fact you hear nary a French accent or a sing-songy bonjour as you would at the beginning of every real human interaction in France, as someone who has been through scores of French villages over the years, I can say at least the scenery is believable. I did read one review by a French native who said in the time period this movie is supposed to represent, virtually all the villages were administered by communists, and I can say that the story writer's seeming grudge against rural Catholic France is deeply unfounded and maybe more a sign of some paranoia. In reality you find churches in every village, most capable of holding hundreds for Mass, being populated by only a few dozen people on Sunday.

Alfred Molina gets too much screen time- I found him downright annoying and kept wanting to fast forward through his scenes. Carrie-Anne Moss is nice to look at, but underused. It's a good rainy day film, but that's about it. Not Miramax's best product in the last few years- inferior to both Shakespeare in Love and The Cider House Rules.

We are just not Gladiator and Planet Of the Apes type filmgoers;  we like films that show normal people living normal lives (I know, a real fringe element!), hopefully showing characters with a sense of humor and inner strength being tested and challenged. Chocolat partly delivers, but in a disturbing way.A strange New Age guru lady and her young daughter descend on a French Catholic city in the late 1950's (pre-Vatican 2). The Mayor controls the town with some pretty stereotypical Nazi behaviors propaganda, gossip, controlling the clergy, etc. The villagers are hungering for Truth To Set Them Free, but what do they get instead of the Christian gospel? Drugged chocolate is what frees them, folks! This is one of the best films promoting drug use to ever come out of Hollywood! Miramax you are just too obvious.The film seemed to be compromising on people's core religious values throughout. Did the New Age religion and paganism promoted by Vianne's character win out, or did the Roman Catholic Priest win out by softening their hearts with a sermon? (Notice how the priest uses the words our Lord's transformation in the last sermon scene instead of the more appropriate words our Lord's resurrection. - What did He transform into? A cuckoo clock?). Why was Disney-Miramax so loathe to use the word resurrection or say the name of Jesus (except for Johnny Depp using it in vain before jumping into the water to save Vianne during the fire scene). Very telling moments to me.These contrasts were even discernable in the musical soundtrack. The same lady who won an Oscar for Miramax's Emma soundtrack created these deep soaring romantic pieces as the main themes (which sounded like outtakes from Emma btw), but thrown in for competition was the sensual guitar strummings of jazz, probably symbolizing the pent up sexual frustrations of the townsfolk.To sum up, I cannot recommend this film for Christian moviegoers. Catholics might be insulted by many scenes insulting their church, and Christians are better off not exposed to its New Age spiritualism.

Few films have illustrated so well this transitional time. Perhaps it is a little obviously sentimental and overly simplistic in setting up the adversaries to manipulate our sympathies, but I think it is churlish to call it sickly.Rarely does a film evoke such a sense of place, with all of the action taking place in an ancient hilltop town by a lazy river - emphasised beautifully by the opening shot zooming in on it, and the closing shot zooming back out. We are transported sensually and emotionally to this town and its inhabitants, and involved totally in the ensuing events. There are fine performances from a well chosen cast, whose French accents speaking English work well in setting the scene. And Johnny Depp even makes a plausible Irishman rover.Sure, it's a fable, and the mystical aspects of the lead character's motivations and wanderings may leave one feeling that more flashback scenes may have added credibility, but I think it is a shame to nitpick over what is a very pleasing, feelgood flick that will give many hankies a workout.

To his credit, director Lasse Hallström keeps the sentiment on a low simmer throughout--this film could easily have become a gooey, gaggy message movie of the most excruciating sort.  Instead, it's just a gooey one.  But that's probably bad enough, as the tasteful, unmelodramatic treatment only makes the story's slightness more apparent.  The material we're dealing with here is nothing more than Kraft Holiday Special fodder, and to give it the Miramax Art-House Masterpiece treatment is really just too much.  The bad French accents don't help much either (nor does Johnny Depp's bad Irish one).  The production design is interesting, but ultimately frustrating--the modest little village is wrapped in so much fog and soft light that it feels more like Brigadoon than any real place.  The period is apparently the late fifties, but you'd never know it from the fog and the Gothic architecture and the clothing that could be from 1945 or 1925 or 1895.  And yes, I realize this was probably the point, but even at the end, when even Alfred Molina's mean old Comte has learned his lesson, things don't seem to have changed much visually in the world of this film.  `Chocolat' feels like a kind of twin sister to another Molina film, `Enchanted April,' only the premise is reversed in that film, the mountain is made to come to Moses instead of the other way round.  In other respects the films are very similar--they're both very simple tales about how everybody should just be nice to everybody else, and in which everything unfolds exactly the way you'd expect.  But while `Enchanted April' suffers from many of the same problems as `Chocolat,' it at least has some witty dialogue, and it knows when to quit, too, rolling the credits about half an hour earlier than its counterpart.

As it is, it tries to be as sweet as the confection of the title, while still trying to ground the story in realism.  My ability to suspend disbelief was exceeded in the fist few scenes.  Vianne comes to a small French village, with her daughter in tow, traveling with a small suitcase. Before you know it, she has opened up a rather elaborate chocolate shop with dozens of tempting offerings.  Where did all that chocolate come from?  Certainly not from the suitcase.  Since the village is very religious and it is the beginning of lent, poor Vianne can't seem to peddle any of her chocolates.  But she keeps cranking out more and more delights.  Where is it all going? Also, Vianne must have come to town with a fair bundle of cash, since she is able to get the shop going and keep it in business with no income.       Chocolat hits you over the head with its message - in fact it also pummels you a bit about the ears with it as well as landing a couple of body blows.  This movie makes Aesop look like a master of subtlety.  Can you really believe that a small group of outcasts and atheists could so easily teach the self-denying devout Christians to live it up?  Where did all those fun-loving celebrants come from in the outdoor party at the end of the movie?  I guess they must have gone to a neighboring village to get the costumes and decorations.                                 When Vianne finally does lure some people to take a taste of her products, they react with such immediate gratification that, if true, I think Vianne's treats would have to be dispensed as a controlled substance.  Even a taste of the smallest piece seems to be a transformative experience.     Juliette Binoche is lovely as usual, and she does have a winning smile and Judy Dench gives it her best at playing the curmudgeon with a tender heart.  That these two fine actresses wound up in this movie is unfortunate - they could have given us something of much more value.

This is the most basic rule of thumb which the film communities practice today.  Many of you reading this must definitely realise this.I'm going to carry out a very basic comparison between 2 Oscar nominated movies i.e. Chocolat and Gladiator.Chocolat - A look into the human weakness of stereotyping people (apart from lusting over gooey chocolate, of course) who are different and unique.  Using religion and ridiculously high standards of morality to stamp out an alleged evil from the good, wholesome townsfolk during the festival of Lent.  As all or most of you already know, the alleged evil is represented by none other than Binoche, accompanied by her adorable, sinless little Anouk.  The latter sounds like it came right out of some Star Wars-ET like I-love-cute-Aliens flick.  The other notable characters are Judi Dench, a displaced diabetic granny whose daughter (Carrie Ann Moss) has forbidden any contact whatsoever between her son and granny, Lena Olin, a battered wife who seeks refuge in the wicker sanctuary run by you know who, Alfred Molina, the over-zealous and sanctimonious mayor and of course, Johnny 21 Jump Street Depp, the drifting Irish gypsy.  To cut a long-story short, everybody realises after a number of morally questionable events (arson on a gypsy boat, a zealot's face covered in cacao, the death of a 70+ year old diabetic whose grandson has immortalised her in a portrtait and has the uncanny ability to stick spoons to his nose) that the human soul must be entitled to enjoy the harmless fruits of life, to appreciate God's beauty and gifts.  Goodness comes out of the deeds of people and not their staunch abstinence. We must never misunderstand people for their uniqueness.  At the end of the film, it feels like we've sat through a sermon of sorts albeit with some tasteful, foreign, mouthwatering humour. Sounds terribly exciting doesn't it?Now consider Gladiator - Russel Crowe, a Roman General (Maximus) who once commanded legions for his emperor, a man who fought and won ancient barbaric battles, suddenly suffers betrayal by the son (none other than Joaquin Phoenix) of the late caesar (Richard Harris).  Joaquin then orders the slaughter of Maximus, his wife and their son.  Maximus escapes, discovers his dead wife and son, and swears revenge. On his quest, he meets a courageous back slave (Djimon Hounsou) and Proximo, the once gladiator turned rich trader in flesh (the late Oliver Reed).  Maximus is then sold into Proximo's school of Gladiators where he stuns everyone with his combat and leadership skills.  Then come the gladiatorial fights in various arenas, followed dramatically by the Collisseum, before all of Rome's ancient decadent splendour.  A romance takes place between Maximus and the reigning caesar's sister (Connie Nielsen) and this leads to her aiding his escape.  His escape foiled by the caesar, he is now destined to face the evil emperor in the arena as a gladiator forced to fight for justice despite suffering a lethal stab.  No lessons, no morals, no simplistic comedy. Just drama, edge of your seat excitement, great sets, wonderful cinematography, great scoring and of course, passionate performances from a talented cast.And the movie you would choose is.............

The main difference with Chocolat is that it is set in a quaint old French town (the rustic beauty of which is the movie's only redeeming feature from this reviewer's perspective), and it throws in a buckshot load of popular Catholic bashing as something of a bonus.Bringing our comparisons up to date, this slightly surreal film is American Beauty with the town's patriarch and mayor playing the role of the ex-marine across the street.

The portrayal of such process that is affecting the lives of millions of people around the world (practically all traditional societies face this challenge as they are stripped off their isolation) as so a small and innocent story - the arrival of a chocolate-maker in a peaceful village - I thought - was a brilliant idea!However by the end of the film I wasn't at all sure if the author was that deep.Great films question the default values of their societies - sometimes showing us how ridiculous they (we) are, sometimes bringing them down with hammers, sometimes reinforcing them at the end but not before a critical examination. Chocolat was clearly not a great film. It turned out to be yet another western self-glorifying story showing controversial issues very one-sidedly and neatly resolved, disguising propaganda (that of political correctness) as objectivity. Just the kind of films that Oscars like, indeed.Chocolat had simple and clear message - liberal is better than religious, those freed become happier (enjoy chocolate, sex, equal rights, etc). On the other hand Catholics are xenophobic, hypocrites, oppressing their wives. The issue of why is missing. They are i) simply bad/stupid/manipulated people, or ii) motivated in the meagre ways that a non-religious viewer could imagine, in this case - holding in power. This is bound to offend any viewers who understand motivation coming from a different perception of the world.Any great film on this topic made in a liberal country, has to ask are we right to believe that we are superior to others?, has to show us the event as the other side feels it, the side we are never compassionate with and we feel justified to go and change.(the oppressed, the zealots, the backward, the non-democratic). Just as the great film from a non-liberal country questions the zeal, oppression, etc. of its society. Unfortunately the liberal countries are far behind in both courage and open-mindedness in film-making compared with those we look down upon.

This is the most basic rule of thumb which the film communities practice today. Many of you reading this must definitely realise this.I'm going to carry out a very basic comparison between 2 Oscar nominated movies i.e. Chocolat and Gladiator.Chocolat - A look into the human weakness of stereotyping people (apart from lusting over gooey chocolate, of course) who are different and unique. Using religion and ridiculously high standards of morality to stamp out an alleged evil from the good, wholesome townsfolk during the festival of Lent. As all or most of you already know, the alleged evil is represented by none other than Binoche, accompaniedby her adorable, sinless little Anouk.  The latter sounds like it came right out of some Star Wars-ET like I-love-cute-Aliens flick.  The other notable characters are Judi Dench, a displaced diabetic granny whose daughter (Carrie Ann Moss) has forbidden any contact whatsoever between her son and granny, Lena olin, a battered wife who seeks refuge in the wicker sanctuary run by you know who, Alfred Molina, the over-zealous and sanctimonious mayor and of course, Johnny 21 Jump Street Depp, the drifting Irish gypsy.  To cut a long-story short, everybody realises after a number of morally questinoable events (arson on a gypsy boat, a zealot's face covered in cacao, the death of a 70+ year old diabetic whose grandson has immortalised her in a portrtait and has the uncanny ability to stick spoons to his nose) that the human soul must be entitled to enjoy the harmless fruits of life, to appreciate God's beauty and gifts.  Goodness comes out of the deeds of people and not their staunch abstinence. We must never misunderstand people for their uniqueness.  At the end of the film, it feels like we've sat through a sermon of sorts albeit with some tasteful, foreign, mouthwatering humour. Sounds terribly exciting doesn't it?Now consider Gladiator - Russel Crowe, a Roman General (Maximus) who once commanded legions for his emperor, a man who fought and won ancient barbaric battles, suddenly suffers betrayal by the son (none other than Joaquin Phoenix) of the late caesar (Richard Harris).  Joaquin then orders the slaughter of Maximus, his wife and their son.  Maximus escapes, discovers his dead wife and son, and swears revenge. On his quest, he meets a courageous back slave (Djimon Hounsou) and Proximo, the once gladiator turned rich trader in flesh (the late Oliver Reed).  Maximus is then sold into Proximo's school of Gladiators where he stuns everyone with his combat and leadership skills.  Then come the gladiatorial fights in various arenas, followed dramatically by the Collisseum, before all of Rome's ancient decadent splendour.  A romance takes place between Maximus and the reigning caesar's sister (Connie Nielsen) and this leads to her aiding his escape. His escape foiled by the caesar, he is now destined to face the evil emperor in the arena as a gladiator forced to fight for justice despite suffering a lethal stab.  No lessons, no morals, no simplistic comedy. Just drama, edge of your seat excitement, great sets, wonderful cinematography, great scoring and of course, passionate performances from a talented cast.And the movie you would choose is.............

This stereotype perhaps owes more to the Left Bank intelligentsia of Paris than it does to la France Profonde, and Chocolat sets out to overturn it with a vengeance. The film is set in the year 1959 in a small French town that is conservative to the point of absurdity. Local affairs are dominated by a reactionary aristocrat, the Comte de Reynaud, who serves as the mayor. Virtually the entire population are pious, churchgoing Catholics, subscribing to a narrow, puritanical interpretation of that faith. (And this in the land of Diderot and Voltaire!) At times I wondered if the film were set not in our universe but in an alternative one where the French Revolution never happened and the country remained a feudal, theocratic monarchy into the second half of the twentieth century under the benevolent rule of King Louis XXIII.Into this bastion of ultra-conservatism breezes a young woman named Vianne Rocher. Vianne does a number of things to upset many of her new neighbours, especially the Comte. She is a freethinker who refuses to attend Mass. She is an unmarried mother with an illegitimate daughter. She befriends a tribe of water-borne gypsies known as the river rats who are deeply unpopular with the rest of the community and even becomes romantically attached to their leader, Roux. Worst of all, she opens a shop selling chocolate. This last would not normally be regarded as a major crime, especially in France, a nation who are said to live to eat whereas the British merely eat to live. In this town, however, chocolate is regarded as a sinful temptation from the devil, especially as Vianne has the temerity to open shop during the sacred fast of Lent.Vianne soon finds herself under attack, particularly from the Comte and the local priest, Pere Henri, but she also has her supporters and loyal customers, and soon strange things begin to happen in the town. An elderly couple declare their love for one another. Josephine, a battered wife, learns to stand up to her abusive husband. A put-upon old woman, Armande, learns to stand up to her overbearing daughter. The townspeople become more tolerant and accepting of the river rats, and even the Comte's heart starts to soften. The suggestion is that it is Vianne's delicious chocolate that is, in some mysterious way, responsible for all these changes.The idea that a chocolate shop could magically be responsible for such a thoroughgoing transformation of a whole town is, of course, a preposterous one, but this is not a realistic film to be interpreted literally. It is rather a fable that invites interpretation on a symbolic level. The trouble with the film as far as I was concerned is that its symbolism rests upon some highly questionable assumptions. Its predominant tone is one of prejudice against organised religion, particularly Catholicism. The Catholic Church is equated with all that is joyless, life-denying and bigoted. Pere Henri is a weak and spineless young man, who lets the Comte write his sermons for him. When Henri finally acquires a backbone and finds the courage to defy the Comte he preaches a sermon urging his congregation to forget about the divinity of Christ and to concentrate instead on His humanity. While some of us, myself included, would welcome a Christianity that focuses on Christ's humanity, this is not the traditional teaching of the Catholic Church, which has always insisted (as have the mainstream Protestant denominations) that Christ is both human and divine.Yet, although the townspeople call Vianne an atheist for her refusal to attend Mass, this is not a film that promotes atheism, if by that term is meant a strict scientific rationalism. Nor, despite Henri's apparent conversion to the tenets of that faith, does it consciously attempt to promote Unitarianism. Rather, the prevailing ethos seems to be that of Hollywood's favourite religion, a misty and sentimental New Age paganism. The film suggests that there is something both mysterious and spiritual about Vianne, said to have been blown into town by the North wind. She is revealed to be descended from a tribe of Central American nomads (although Juliette Binoche's features do not really suggest such an exotic ancestry). Her daughter Anouk is in mystic communion with an invisible kangaroo named Pantoufle. Both of them wear red hoods and cloaks, which may not have any definite symbolic meaning but which gives them the air of fairy-tale characters.Vianne's shop can, in fact, be seen as the centre of an alternative religion, with her as its priestess. This religion has its own sacrament (eating chocolate), its converts, and even its own martyr when Armande, who turns out to be a diabetic, kills herself with an overdose of chocolate. Above all, it has its Two Commandments, Be tolerant of your neighbour and Self-indulgence is better than abstinence. While the first is unexceptionable, the second is based on a misconception. Whereas self-denial may not in itself make a person a saint (although religious believers may find the self-discipline involved spiritually beneficial), neither does indulgence, whether sexual or gastronomic. It is quite wrong to imply that asceticism is automatically linked to narrow-mindedness, joylessness or bigotry. Think, for example, of Saint Francis or Mahatma Gandhi. The film sets out to be an anti-Catholic satire, but fails to understand the spiritual tradition it is satirising. (And I write that as a non-Catholic).Despite some star names in the cast, the acting is not particularly distinguished. The film's best feature is some attractive, if at times cloyingly so, photography of the French countryside, but this is not enough to save it. The film's central metaphor is perhaps appropriate in a way that was not intended. Too much chocolate can make you sick. And this is definitely too much. 4/10 "},{"Title":"From pure cocoa to pure caca...","Date":"19 January 2006","Score":"4 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":" As Homer Simpson famously said, once upon a time in a magic land of make-believe called France..., some well-intentioned souls imagined a story that unfortunately has nothing to do with France or Frenchmen, full of bad, repressed, Catholic and decadently noble tightwads and gentle, liberated free souls bent on showing them that chocolate is the key to opening the senses, broadening minds and bringing about world peace. In order to make this cloying illusion complete, no actual Frenchman was harmed (or used) during the making of this film - except Hollywood's Française de service du jour, Juliette Binoche. A very tenacious analysis of the art direction, costumes, etc., might help establish that the film aimed for a period falling anywhere between the Middle Ages and 1953 (before television anyway), but it turns out the film was supposed to be set in 1959, a period that was famous for its political and social upheavals, the popularity of Brigitte Bardot as a role model for young women and the inroads of rock and pop music in mainstream French culture, none of which is reflected in this film, which presents France as a backwash of Mongolia. Whatever the merits of this sad, manipulative and weepy chick-flick and its generic pastel-coloured morality may be, it is a perfect commercial fit for a bloated matriarchal, North-American society hungry for risk-free temporal and spatial exoticism, comprising the greatest number of obese people and diabetics in the world and where everything but dental floss, mouthwash and toothpaste (if that!) is now available in a chocolate flavour.

I'm about to discuss plot changes......Why was the villain changed from the priest to the mayor? The book is about temptation in Lent (with chocolate a metaphor for sex and other temptation). Having a priest as the oppressor makes infinite more sense.Why was Pantouffle changed from a rabbit into a kangaroo? A kangaroo in rural France? Why was the movie set in the 50s? In reading the book I never got the impression that it was set in the past. In fact, if you read one of Harris' other books, Blackberry Wine, set in the same town with some overlap of characters, it is obviously set in the 90s.What was it with the Mexican symbols & the different history of her Mother. The book was mysterious enough with the unnamed fears the mother was fleeing and the suggestion of child abduction. The Mexican story line was a let down.Why was Roux changed from a red-headed man with a Marseilles accent into dark-headed Johnny Depp with a bad Irish accent? Roux is the French word for red. If they wanted Johnny Depp in the role, he should have dyed his hair.Why did the story end with Vianne & Roux living happily every after? In the book, the wind changes and Vianne goes with it.

Daughter in tow, she sets up chocolate shops and single-handedly brings down prudishness once her stodgy neighbors get a taste of her sweet, homemade chocolate delights. An opening voice-over reminds us that this is a fable and as long as the film stages its simple-minded tale within the confines of fairy tale devices it is mostly smooth sailing from there.Lasse Hallstrom's mistake is that he bolsters his film's light-natured facade with a feeble attempt at giving the film a significantly serious moral thrust. It's the kind of plot that writes itself conservative religious town finds the chocolate-peddling ways of the godless new citizen to be sacrilegious but by film's end everyone has learned to find that joy that lies within the cocoa seed. The film begins to take itself so seriously that one is forced to wonder if Hallstrom actually believes his material is controversial in nature.Perhaps my general indifference to the film has something to do with my utter dislike for chocolate. Even though the substance always manages to look heavenly when glorified on the screen, I find it very hard to watch it portrayed as a potential aide to achieving sexual orgasm. Once Vianne's first customer manages to unlock the secret to her husband's long-repressed sex drive, via the chocolate truffles that soulfully correspond to her persona, all remaining townsfolk find themselves slowly submitting before Vianne's offerings.It's never really clear why Vianne gets so upset when she is treated poorly by the town's citizens. In light of the fact that her work history is based on spreading the liberating love of chocolate throughout prudish towns, why would one town's hesitancy be anymore troubling than another's? The great Lena Olin plays a battered wife named Josephine Muscat who seeks refuge from her husband (Peter Stormare) in Vianne's shop, soon becoming Vianne's assistant. In what has to be one of the most unbelievable character arcs ever portrayed on screen, Hallstrom has us believe that Josephine is capable of going from kleptomaniac and paranoid schizophrenic to upstanding feminist at the snap of one's finger.I have always viewed Alfred Molina as that special kind of actor who manages to creep into otherwise forgettable film projects when a director is itching for prestige, ala James Woods and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Molina has a meatier part in Chocolat then we usually see him in, playing the town's mayor and Vianne's moral opponent. He is the staunch supporter of uptight religiosity and makes it his mission to single-handedly drive Vianne out of the town. He's the savage beast that will undoubtedly be tamed by film's end.Abortion was the hot-button issue in The Cider House Rules where Hallstrom wove a manipulative tale around Tobey Maguire's journey to pro-choice enlightenment. Here the issue is patriarchal religion and, although I am a proud agnostic, I find Hallstrom's approach to be condescending and trivializing, as if religiosity is inherently comical in it's staunch inhospitality, curable through a little bit of self-indulgence.Binoche, bearing a striking resemblance to Julia Roberts in many of the film's scenes, is good in the film despite playing second fiddle to the chocolate that she hawks. Judi Dench is one of many actors with thankless parts, playing the role of the diabetes-afflicted martyr who opts to live her final days full of chocolate instead of insulin. The entire film is innocent in nature until it turn's manipulative when Johnny Depp's pirate character enters the scene and one is left to wonder if Hallstrom is going to have the entire town construct concentration camps in order to punish the undesirables. It's a film that takes itself entirely too seriously for a comedy and seems to beg that we be shocked by how scandalous it thinks it's being.

(I also wrote a six-page review of the book for a college class, so my understanding of these characters is&#133; much greater than I wish it were.) I'd love to provide a detailed analysis of why I hated this movie (primarily because it was up for so many awards), but if I did that, no one would read it, so I'll try to state my opinions as briefly as possible.Joanne Harris' message was simple and clear religious people should not impose their morality on others, particularly because they are hypocrites. The author expresses (what apparently was) her real-life frustrations through Vianne, the fortune-telling shop owner. Vianne is portrayed as a victim of religious oppression.I'm not Catholic, but I was offended by Harris' deep anti-Catholic sentiment. In the book, the priest (Francis Reynaud) is portrayed as both hypocritical and Machiavellian in nature; a model of the Catholic church, no doubt, as Harris implies. What is so surprising about the movie adaptation is that the priest is replaced with the mayor, apparently in an attempt to prevent offending Catholic audiences. But Catholics are still portrayed as zealots, placing on ban on immorality on Vianne's evil chocolate shop.I literally felt sick as I read Chocolat, and I had the same experience watching the movie. The reason for this, I soon after realized, was simple I hated the good guys. The author wanted me to sympathize with Vianne and Anouk, and really hate Reynaud, but I couldn't. This story was told in such a one-sided way, I ended up hating the author, and hating the protagonist as a result.Unfortunately, the movie works the same way. The story is too dreadfully stupid to bear. In her book, Joanne Harris made up for this (to a certain extent) with her poetic writing style; but on film, the idyllic scenery is the only redemption for a poor storyline.As a side note, this movie contains one sex scene with partial nudity (breasts)--woman on top. This event was not written about in the original book, so it was completely unnecessary; I wish they hadn't included it (it made me feel even more sick than I did watching the rest of this rotten movie). The book did contain a gut-wrenching sex scene of its own between Vianne and Jean in a garden; at least in the movie, this was reduced a very nasty make-out session on the boat.In any case, a movie that leaves you feeling physically sick is off-the-scale bad. But since the lowest rating I can possible give Chocolat is a 1, that's precisely what it's going to get from me. I'm afraid Chocolat left a bitter taste in my mouth. Do not see this movie.

Which she frequents in the sub-conscious hope that someone may overhear and be impressed by her blabbing loudly about the sacred feminine and extolling its virtues over the patriarchal and oppressive Judeo/Christian worldview of Western Civilization. So if that is the kind of person that you are impressed by, you will probably enjoy this film very much.p.s. if this movie were a person, it would be reading The Mists of Avalon, in the waiting room of its psychiatrists office.

I got it free with my laptop along with Godzilla. I thought it would be good but it wasn't.A single mum who doesn't go to church arrives in a small town to open a chocolate shop on lent. Everyone thinks she's a no good atheist whore. As the film goes on, the same scene happens over and over. Oh you have problems? Well come on in, eat some of my cruddy chocolate. No really I couldn't, God would disapprove! Go ahead! OK then... mmmmmmmm... this is some good chocolate, liberalism is great isn't it? All the while the mayor still hates her guts and tries to drive her out of town.Juliette Binoche is sickeningly smug. Dame bloody Judi Dench delivers a typically oh everyone in Hollywood loves me, look at me lending my genius in another small role to another lame film performance with her accent wittering all over the place. Dirty gypo, Johnny Depp turns up to see what he can do for the film but is too busy playing guitar and trying to shag the aforementioned atheist whore to manage anything. You can tell they thought they were being bloody clever when they made it. I loathed every single one of the characters and by the end was hoping they'd all get aids and die.It is a stupid film in the guise of smart film for stupid people to put on their favourite film list next to Sleepers and Shawshank Redemption as though they're some sort of arty film critic. If anyone wants the DVD of this film you can find it outside my window.

I was pretty disappointed. The idea was very unoriginal (Pleasantville is another unpleasant, rebellious film). Also the acting was pretty poor, with bad French/English/American accents that didn't fit and overdubs that were done poorly. And then we get to the script- cheesy, predictable and very cliche (who says I can't use a skillet!). Anyway, I was disappointed by this film about chocolate, sex, and how evil men and religion are.

Binoche and Depp outsiders????? Maybe from Outsiders R Us. Think about what this movie could have been if, instead of starring the two attractive millionaires, it had starred two real outsiders, perhaps North African emigrants, perhaps running a couscous stand rather than a candy store. Think about what this film could have been if it had actually been made on location in France, and subtitled in English from French and Arabic. Suppose that, instead of the Catholic church (a comfortable, cuddly patsy if ever there was one), the opposition had been Le Pen and the French hard rightists. Unfortunately reality is too disturbing, and the film would be robbed of all its saccharine magic. It wouldn't have been able to make the jump from the art house to the cineplex if it were any different than what it turned out to be. But I would have enjoyed it. Quel dommage.

I mean everybody in it seems to love chocolates, nobody seem to care about their weight. Oh but I love this movie. The story is so extraordinary, and all the actors seem to give their best. And it's something special when you are talking about Juliette Binoche and Judi Dench. Even Johnny Depp is above average and Carrie Anne-Moss shows her softer side. A must-see for all of you! "},{"Title":"In comparison with Amelie, a strong artificial taste...","Date":"20 December 2001","Score":"6 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance","Review":"  I originally saw Chocolat in France. It opened during Lent and was shown in English, for maximum insult-the-French value I guess, and had a mercifully short run with no great popularity (especially when compared with other anglophone films such as Chicken Run, Shrek, and Mission Impossible 2). I saw it juxtapositioned between multiple viewings of Amelie Poulain. Such a difference between the French fairy tale (told in a light, colorful if longwinded way), and the politically correct Anglo/American pseudofrench clunker. It was like the difference between breathing and watching a lecture on breathing from the viewpoint of a tree. Now that Amelie is available in the US, I am saddened to see how little attention it has drawn other than from the critics.  Maybe the real thing is a little bit too foreign, and will have to be remade with Madonna to be as palatable to Americans as Chocolat was.

Figured it couldn't be that bad-- enough awards/nominations were sloshed its way. It's nothing special, so if you don't see it, you're not doing yourself any disservice. In fact, I would really recommend that you rent something of substance instead.Written in the typical female idiom, it follows a woman who blows into a stuffy French town. She, of course, flaunts convention and is slightly puzzled when people don't like her. She has a small daughter and she is fiercely independent. The mayor doesn't like her because she doesn't go to church and her business, a Chocolatier, is open on Sundays. A dying old lady (Judi Dench), super-hunk gypsy (Johnny Depp) and an abused wife (?) rounds out the cast of characters, assuring academy awards and female viewers.The story goes in a fairly predictable line. The chocolate maker isn't welcome but she wins people over one by one with her sweets (some of them possessing powers, of course). She meets a kind and handsome wanderer &#151;they, of course, fall in love. Along the way, a woman who is mentally ill is cured by chocolates and leaves her abusive husband, the grumpy old woman becomes friendly and then dies. In the end, the whole town becomes a haven of happiness.All in all, not worth renting unless you intend to sleep through it while your girlfriend watches. "}]
