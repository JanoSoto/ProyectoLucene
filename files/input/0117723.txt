I noticed Weird Al right away from his part singing the theme song. 'Spy Hard's' purpose is to create a comical version of James Bond and similar spy-themed films. Some of the comedy is very funny, but some of it wears thin throughout the film. (You'll either enjoy the sense of humour, or you will hate it.) WD40 is a great name for the secret agent, and Mr. T even makes an appearance. There is also a lot of adult-themed humour. By the end of the film, I was ready for it to be finished. It's funny, but it's not brilliant, but I cannot complain because it did let me laugh. If you like Austin Powers, you will probably like this, even though it is not as popular. It will also take you right back to the early 1990s. Not a perfect film, it does have some good humour.

In Spy Hard, we are shown that sadly Leslie Nielsen has befallen this fate. Starting in the 1950's with Ransom! and Forbidden Planet (both 1956), Nielsen would eventually become a king of the slapstick comedy. Staring in television's Police Squad (1982), and eventually evolving this idea into the brilliant series of Naked Gun films (1988, 1991 and 1994), Nielsen appeared to be on a role. Sadly however, only two years after that third outing as Frank Drebin, Nielsen produced this amusing, but awkward spoof of the Spy film.In Spy Hard, Leslie Nielsen plays Dick Steele (codename Agent WD-40). Coming out of retirement to fight his long term adversary General Rancor (Andy Griffith), Steele encounters the daughter of his lost love and a beautiful Russian Agent who he slowly falls for.Spy Hard does have the potential to be brilliant. With Weird Al Yankovic providing the Bond copying opening soundtrack, it sets off to a nice start. It soon drops off though, until it reaches a disappointing finale which grates on the skin.Whilst Yankovic might add to the movie, as does Nicolette Sheridan's delectable Russian Agent, the flaws with this outing are vast and numerous in comparison to it's positives. The character of Rancor is just irrelevant and dumb, the occasional famous cameo (Hulk Hogan, Mr T, Dr Joyce Brothers) is stuck in randomly and badly to give the audience an extra moment of happiness, whilst the spoof of Miss Moneypenny (entitled Miss Cheevus) is overwritten and placed as an unexplained traitor. In the end of the day however, these points could perhaps of been overlooked if Nielsen had simply been ten years younger.For the leading Spy, who is expected to sleep with countless beautiful women, to be an obviously aged fifty year old feels almost offensive. This isn't meant to be some sort of ageist comment (yes in this world of excessive Political Correctness, ageist IS a word), it's simply a fact. Nielsen looks slow and knackered and positively farcical in this role. Perhaps, just perhaps, this is meant to be a spoof of Bond in it's own right, implying that when men like Sean Connery can reprise the role at an old age the series looses respect. Ultimately however, this does seem unlikely and it seems more predictable that Nielsen simply wanted to play the lead part. If this is the case, I'm sorry Leslie, but it's time you retire with what little grace and dignity that you have left.In summary, Spy Hard could have been good. There are one or two very nice lines in there, with some thrown in movie tributes as well, ultimately however it collapses on it's face. It's not the worst spoof ever created, but with Nielsen leading the way, it's not that far off.

I will admit I was expecting it to be a lot worse, you see Friedberg and Seltzer directed Disaster Movie and Epic Movie which are two of the worst movies ever made, Meet the Spartans which fares little better and Date Movie and Vampires Suck while lame was the best of the lot(I have to re watch the Scary Movie flicks). So I was expecting something unwatchable.So I was surprised at how moderately entertaining Spy Hard was. It does have its problems I agree. The story is predictable and rather rushed in the pace not helped by its scant length. The direction is also not the best, sometimes it is efficient but at other times it is patchy. But the worst part of Spy Hard is the juvenile and often unfunny dialogue which shows Friedberg and Seltzer's weaknesses for writing as well as directing.That said, despite the bad dialogue at times, there are some funny sight gags and the references to the spy genre weren't too obvious and fun to spot. The film doesn't look like direct-to-video fodder either, which is a good thing. The editing mayn't be the best, but when it comes to the sets, costumes, gadgetry and some of the photography it is pretty spot on. The soundtrack is reminiscent in style to a James Bond outing such as For Your Eyes Only, and while I am not a fan of that particular score the music was fun to listen to here and I liked its style. The acting compared to any of the films Friedberg and Seltzer directed is pretty good, Leslie Nielson is great when funny and he is rather here with a fun enough character. This performance is far from his best such as Airplane and Naked Gun, but at least he didn't embarrass himself as badly as he did when he did 2001A Space Travesty. Charles Durning and Nicolette Sheridan are decent too and there are some interesting cameos from Robert Culp and Fabio.Overall, surprisingly watchable compared to the clap-trap I was expecting. 6/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Mores misses than hits","Date":"26 June 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Action","Review":" I love this kind of movie - parodies.

That formula also states to chalk up a long list of impersonators and to lampoon everything that's pop culture at the moment, and to string a series of bad gags to make up what's essentially some semblance of a story, not.But it wasn't all that bad to begin with. Early in their career they're responsible for writing the Scary Movie franchise, and made their debut with writing Spy Hard, a film that starred the late Leslie Nielsen, and I suppose back then there was enough budget for the filmmakers to hire bona fide stars such as Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, the male model Fabio, Mr T and even the late Pat Morita of Karate Kid's Mr Miyagi fame, before the flops spell out the hiring of impersonators (no offense to the profession) since I would believe the stars wouldn't want to go touch these productions with a ten foot pole given a regressing track record.I've always associated Leslie Nielsen with his better known Naked Gun series, and while his brand of comedy had gone beyond detective Frank Drebin, somehow Nielsen is quite the enigma, and becomes a character in his own right no matter what role he gets to play. Cue the signature blank stares, the innuendos and the physical slapstick comedy that he's perfected, that you'll know you're in for a hoot no matter how bad the story is. Here his Agent WD-40 aka Dick Steele (OK, so here's the cat out of the bag for friends who wonder why Dick Steel was a handle I used - dropping the last e in Steele for more bite during my online gaming days) is the quintessential spoof-Bond, with mysterious charisma and suave to win over the femme fatales, and gets the job done with questionable, unorthodox methods.Yes, I suppose one of the easiest way to spoof a film or a franchise is to set the sights on James Bond. After all, we have Johnny English and Austin Powers to come after this, so there's plenty of room actually for more of such wannabes who have their equivalent of a theme song, here performed in hilarious fashion and easily one of the best sequences here with a Weird Al Yankovic contribution full of inane lyrics, and keep a close eye on those gyrating silhouettes!Like all comedic films by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer to follow this, Spy Hard is the precursor to their idea that comedy stems from poking fun at the box office successes of the time, and in the mid 90s, we get spoofs here from films such as Jan de Bont's Speed, Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Cameron's True Lies, Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire and even Sister Act which allowed for some nuns with guns moments. While it's part of the fun spotting, or rather identify all the blatant spoof attempts, this soon wears out their welcome and like their follow up films, it seems that lessons aren't learnt from spoof fatigue. Simply put the story here dwells on Agent WD-40 stopping his arch nemesis General Rancor (Andy Griffith, or TV's Matlock), but its relentless buffoonery didn't quite survive past the halfway mark where jokes consistently fell flat and were unfunny.Still, the best thing about the film is to watch Leslie Nielsen at his element with yet another Nielsen-isque performance, and for fans around the world, he will definitely be missed as one of the unlikeliest comedians of our generation. Rest in peace, and thank you for the memories.

In the Police Squad! series, Leslie Nielsen played a straight dead-pan character, very serious. Very little mugging to the camera, and reacted to the silliness around him with a dryness that only Jack Webb could muster.In Spy Hard, we have a cartoonish character whose a buffoon. He mugs to the camera at every turn. He's trying to have fun with the audience. Sadly it just makes him look sad. The best thing about this movie (the 5 star moment) was the opening credits sung by Wierd Al. After that, to say it's ok is pushing it. It's bad, but not bad enough to be good.

This time, Nielson is spy Agent Dick Steele, WD-40 and is on a mission to save the world from General Rancor (Andy Griffith), who wants to destroy the world with a missile that can only be assessed with a special computer trip kept hidden by its inventor, Professor Ukrinsky (Elya Baskin), who wants to use the computer trip for more peaceful purposes. Along the way, Steele teams up with Ukrinsky's daughter, KGB agent Veronique Ukrinsky, Agent 3.14.As with any Nielson spoofs, there are non-stop laughs from start to finish that will have you horse-laughing and holding your stomaches. Slapstick humor is abundance here, from bumping into sliding glass doors to rolling down a street on an ambulance stretcher. However, the slapstick humor is done tastefully in a way that is doesn't get borderline annoying (i.e., forced comedy).The characters are calm and serious in their demeanor, especially Nielson, believing that they are really out on a classified mission, which gives this spoof the perfect balance of sensitivity and comedy. Actors in some other spoofs like Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans know they are appearing in a spoof movie, so they forced themselves to act stupid and go overboard on the slapstick comedy. As a result, this gives the audience a tasteless film.It is fun to see this movie reference many other movies including Jurassic Park, Home Alone, True Lies, Sister Act and the James Bond films. The nuns using machine guns, 'Weird Al' Yankovic's James Bond-like opening song sequence and Dick Steele riding a Marines fighter jet are some of my favorite parts, as well as seeing Dick Steele's sidekick Kabul (John Ales) drive up in a different car in each of his different scenes.While entertaining, this movie is a little the short side, clocking at 81 minutes, which doesn't give much room for plot and character development and more laughs. Therefore, I felt the story was a little rushed-through. But, other than that, this is an enjoyable movie with some of Nielson's finest moments.Grade B "},{"Title":"I like it, it's funny but ultimately, it's not very good....","Date":"12 June 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Action","Review":" Yes, you do have to enjoy Leslie Nielson - and millions do - and I am one of them and whilst they're always funny and enjoyable, they do repeat quite obvious gags.He (& the production team) do those very well, of course and Nielson's sense of comic timing spot-on. However, this parody on the James Bond's and Spies of the cinematic world is seldom original. The funniest bits tend to be the gags away from those obviously 'Spy' genre and there's much sending up of films such as Home Alone, Speed, Pulp Fiction, True Lies, Sister Act, Jurassic Park, In the Line of Duty and finally a classic 007 fight-out.However, most of these are just too similar to the originals to be anything more than amusingly recognisable. I'm not saying that they're any better or worse than the Scary Movies send up's of horror flicks, but they could do better; mind you, I never thought I'd see the day Nielson takes the John Travolta role, grey hair in a ponytail, in the infamous dance with Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction.As always, the Silver haired charmer gets the most unlikely of gorgeous ladies and as always these are great value as their ridiculousness are always so well spoofed up. As Dick Steele, (Agent WD40) Nielsen is suitably inept and takes the praise that others create around him, whilst he wreaks havoc. There's a great cameo from Ray Charles as a blind bus driver in the Speed sketch and Charles Durning contributes a large slice of humour as 'The Director', Steele's boss.Leslie Nielsen, RIP - Spy Hard was not his finest film, not a bad one, but alas, not a very good one, which is down to the material, not the great man himself.

Their signature gags-per-minute style of on-screen jokes is very evident here, not to mention Leslie Nielsen's starring role and a cameo by Weird Al Yankovic. However, this film is mainly missing what Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker usually include in their previous films laughs.Actually, there are a few funny moments, but the rest of the movie seems to try too hard to be funny. The films references to popular, but non-spy, movies from that era (approximately 1992-1996) also feel out of place most of the time, and contribute nothing to the story. Leslie Nielsen still brings his trademark deadpan sensibilities to the role of special agent Dick Steele, but the rest of the film is weighed down by gags that are way too obvious, character names that serve as an all too desperate attempt to fish laughs from the audience (Dick Steele being a great example, and yes, there are penis jokes associated with that name), and missed opportunities.When I say missed opportunities, I'm talking mainly about Andy Griffith's role as terrorist General Rancor. To me, it's funny that American's quintessential nice guy would play the villain in this movie. However, that irony is never capitalized upon at any point when Griffith is on the screen. Because his character had his arms blown off, there are dumb running gags about his mechanical prosthetics. There's also a scene where he says, No Dick can stop me, which seems too open an invitation for a phallic joke. Sure enough, that joke arrives unfashionably early.The equally dumb names continue with the many femme fatales, beginning with Dick Steele's previous partner in crime, agent Barbara Dahl (Barbie Doll. Ho ho ho!). The worst was Miss Cheevus, played by Marcia Gay Harden years before winning an Academy Award.There's nothing really wrong with the story. A federal agent tries to stop a madman terrorist from taking over the world. I can get behind that. I mean, this terrorist wants to take over the world, but doesn't seem to know what he's going to do with it afterwards. Well, neither do terrorists in more serious-toned films.The problem lay in the story being weighed down by way too many movie references, none of which had to do with the plot or with spy films in general. For instance, there are ironically no references to GoldenEye (1995), the James Bond film that came out months before. There are, however, famous scenes repeated from Cliffhanger (1993), Pulp Fiction (1994), Home Alone (1990), Apollo 13 (1995), Speed (1994), and the famous Paul Newman bike-riding scene from Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid (1968). The latter reference came out of left field and broke the pattern.Still, with the exception of Ray Charles as a bus driver during the Speed spoof, all the other parody scenes were not funny. They were also barely parodies because they didn't point out the irony of their respective iconic moments. Leslie Nielsen and Nicollette Sheridan dance the exact same way John Travolta and Uma Thurman did in Pulp Fiction, and to the exact same song. But that was it. It's almost as if the filmmakers' thought, Hey, 'Pulp Fiction' was popular a few years ago. Let's throw in this scene from it. I could rant about Nielsen's agent number being WD-40, and how just having the name of a waterproof spray does not a funny gag make. Still, it at least tried to make fun of spy movies, which is what a film called SPY Hard should be doing.The fault here lies in the writing, particularly contributions by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. If these names sound familiar, they belong to two writers who would go on to ruin the credibility of Scary Movie, which they helped co-write, by making Date Movie (2006), Epic Movie (2007), Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie (both 2008), and Vampires Suck (2010). Those latter films ruined the parody genre, and are even more guilty of pop culture referencing without actual humor than this movie is. Their contributions to this movie probably resulted in it being worse than it could have been.Fortunately, of the many cameos, Weird Al Yankovic made the most of his appearance. His song, Spy Hard, was an incredibly funny send-up of James Bond themes from Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger to Tom Jones' Thunderball, both lyrically and visually. It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't keep up, as hard as it may have spied.

First of all, just so there's no confusion about this whatsoever, I absolutely LOVE Leslie Nielson, and my beef with this film has nothing to do with a lack of a sense of humor or an unwillingness to appreciate dumb comedy, because dumb comedy is my FAVORITE KIND of comedy!!!  But, having said that, I just can't believe a dramatic and comedic legend like Leslie Nielson would sign on for such a lackluster, overly-commercialized and genuinely UNfunny project.

But even the Old Snow-Capped L-Train himself couldn't save this mishandled, overdone Hollywood stink-bomb.  After Weird Al Yankovic's Golfinger-esque opening spy theme (which I was very surprised to learn he wrote himself, and was probably the best thing about the whole picture), the story's vague development and superfluous characters quickly sink what could have been a worthy vessel.  For instance, did we really need the ethnic cab-driver character?  He adds nothing at all to this film, is given WAY too much screen time, and really annoys more than entertains.  Also, there were too many misdirected parodies.  A screaming secret agent McCauley Caulken?!?!  That's original...if it's 1992!!!

I haven't seen all of these spoofs, but of the ones I have seen, some of them are funny (like they're obviously supposed to be), and others not so much. Unfortunately, Spy Hard is one of the latter. It's not a complete disaster, but a disappointing film in the spoof genre nonetheless, with very little to be remembered by.Dick Steele, Agent WD-40 is a retired secret agent. However, he is lured out of retirement when General Rancor, an old foe of his, has plans to destroy the world, and Steele is assigned to stop him! On his mission, Steele is joined by Veronique Ukrinsky, a young Russian agent, and together, they must make their way to General Rancor's lair! On their way, many challenges await! The most amusing and memorable part of this movie is Weird Al Yankovic's theme song, a parody of James Bond themes. That song was what lead me to watch Spy Hard, seeing its sequence from this movie in 'Weird Al' Yankovic The Ultimate Video Collection. So, in other words, I had already seen the best part of the movie by the time I saw the whole thing. The rest of the movie is nothing special. I lightly snickered at the part when a light tap on the shoulder leads to a fist fight, but for the rest of the film, I didn't laugh at all. Aside from James Bond, several other films are also parodied, but not parodied very well. Basically, Spy Hard just has one mediocre gag after another, and not too many are worth mentioning. It's all extremely silly, and not in a good way.Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer were writers for this 1996 spy spoof, and since then, they've definitely gone on to do much worse! It appears they started out mediocre (looking at Spy Hard), and their more recent work is a crime against humanity, proving they should not be in the comedy business! So, Spy Hard isn't the worst film that Friedberg and Seltzer had something to do with (it might even be the best!), but it's still not worth it, if you ask me, and I know many would agree, since it has such a low rating. Fortunately, Austin Powers International Man of Mystery, another silly James Bond spoof, but a far superior one, was released the year after this forgettable flop.

Or, we would never get classics such as the Naked Gun series, or, the short-lived 'Police Squad!' series that Naked Gun was based off of. Or, hell, even Wrongfully Accused. Well, this time Nielsen comes in as Dick Steele/Agent WD-40, who has just found out that when he blew up his 'arch enemy', General Rancor (Played by Andy Griffith) is plannin' on destroyin' the world with a missile. Well, this leads up to the usual hilarious slapstick comedy in a Leslie Nielsen film. When I first caught this film in the movies, the opening scene with 'Weird Al' Yankovic had me laughin' for about twenty-minutes straight! Causin' me to miss the first twenty-minutes of the film. The perfect comedy that will have you laughin' all throughout the damn movie! Pullin' off a solid rating of an eight from me. Also, lookout for cameos from Mr. T, Ray Charles, Hollywood Hogan, Tone Loc, etc. "}{"Title":"Terrific opening credits sequence","Date":"17 October 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Action","Review":"  After watching Weird Al's opening credit sequence, I thought Spy Hard was going to be a great movie.I guess I was wrong.

This is one of the latter.I popped this in because i, like many of the people who watched the Naked gun series (and Airplane and Scary Movies) loved the way the Zucker Abrams director team made incredible comedy with Leslie Nielson.But this movie was directed by entirely different people, who had no qualms about totally ripping off those comic geniuses and what's more egregious- failing to be funny! Just don't waste your time- there are still plenty of great comedies with outrageous Leslie Nielson playing the same exact character that are actually bearable to watch. Unfortunately this is not one of them.

Pure genius. The film itself isn't quite up to that standard, but it's very funny in places, and Nielsen carries the film with fanastic charisma. He is Agent Dick Steele(WD-40), who is sent out to stop General Rancor, an evil megalomaniac threatening to destroy the world. Simple premise, but director Rick Friedberg and his scriptwriter son Jason have given it some funny one-liners too. I like the Ray Charles Speed spoof the best. In places the jokes don't come off with good effect, but overall it's very enjoyable.

This movie has some great of these 'simple, stupid' laughs in it but the story really restrains this movie from being a true good or recommendable one.The story is so bad that the movie becomes real painful to watch in parts! At times you really don't know what is really happening on screen or why, just because it doesn't make sense. It really lacked a real clear and good main plot-line.The movie also tries to spoof way too many movies, just for the sake of spoofing. Most of the time these spoofing moments really don't fit within the movie and seem to be put in completely randomly. It was as if the director was making a sport out of it how many movies he could spoof within one movie.It's of course also a very easy thing to spoof the spy-genre. In that regard this movie has all the jokes in it you would most likely expect.Of course most comical moments and dialog are very lame. But often they are so lame and stupid that you can't help but laugh at them. So no matter how bad this movie actually is, it's still a movie that can and most likely will make you laugh, with also some cameo's from people such as non other then Ray Charles and Hulk Hogan.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Decent spoof movie","Date":"24 January 2004","Score":"6 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Action","Review":"  This at first appeared to be a spoof of James Bond, but in actuality it spoofs a lot of different movies; this could probably have worked, but unfortunately, most of the gags are not very funny. The few gags that did work for me were the spoofs of Pulp Fiction and Home Alone, but apart from those, most were not funny, some of them were even embarrassingly bad. Considering the material, which movies they spoofed, they could've done better; most of the movies spoofed(and especially the main theme, James Bond movies) could've been parodied a lot better. Unless you're a hardcore fan of Leslie Nielsen, you probably won't enjoy this film on any more than a casual level, as it's nothing special. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless they truly can't stand the very thought of there being a spoof movie that they haven't seen. This movie is very average, and there is nothing at all in the movie to indicate otherwise. The gags are mostly boring, the acting is embarrassing, and the parodies are almost so unfunny that it hurts. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Spy Harder to Find a Decent Screenplay.","Date":"19 June 2015","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Action","Review":" Spy Hard (1996) Dir Rick Friedberg / Cast Leslie Nielsen, Andy Griffith, Nicolette Sheridan, Charles Durning, Marcia Gay Harden Carbon copy of the superior Naked Gun comedies that also showcased the absent-minded slapstick humour of Leslie Nielsen. It is a direct spoof of James Bond films with lashes at other films particularly Die Hard. Nielsen stars as secret agent WD-40 better known as Dick Steele who is called upon to rescue Barbara Dahl from a past villain. Dahl is the daughter of a past deceased girlfriend. Premise wears thin and jokes become forced. Director Rick Friedberg has fun with the parodies with effective setups to other films, but too much is familiar. Nielsen seems in on the joke here and is never as funny as his Frank Drebin role from The Naked Gun films. Andy Griffith is also distant as the villain with artificial arms. Nicolette Sheridan is wasted as a Bond bombshell whose seduction is no match for any Bond girls. Charles Durning as Steele's boss inspires some comic wit with his constant hideouts but the role is otherwise standard. Marcia Gay Harden also has the comic chops but in the wrong movie for it. It is indeed a spoof of James Bond films with a few funny moments but Nielsen is far better in The Naked Gun films where characters seem broader. This spy contraption is a horrid carbon copy that is about as artificial as the villain's arms.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's worth my money, but probably not yours. Weird Al's theme song is just about the best things about Spy Hard, but there were some other good moments post opening credits.If you want a really good James Bond spoof, Austin Powers International Man Of Mystery is still the ticket. However, I'd still take Spy Hard over either of the horrible Austin Powers sequels.And if you're saying to yourself Self, I just can't believe a really old looking guy playing a James Bond type character then I would say that you clearly never saw Roger Moore in A View To A Kill!SPY HARD= 5/10.WEIRD AL'S THEME SONG= 10/10.LESLIE NEILSEN PULLING OFF AN ELDERLY JAMES BOND CHARACTER BETTER THAN ROGER MOORE IN A VIEW TO A KILL= 9/10 "},{"Title":"Leslie Nielsen Drops His Pants","Date":"22 August 2011","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Action","Review":" Promiscuous secret agent Leslie Nielsen (as Dick Steele) comes out of retirement and assumes his spy identity as WD-40 to battle old enemy Andy Griffith (as Rancor), made-up to look like Leonid Brezhnev and aiming to take over the entire free world.
