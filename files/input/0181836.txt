Here, the superheroes are less dysfunctional and more beset by the amorous pangs and gnawing dissatisfactions of everyday life; the humor ranges from the gulpingly broad to the surprisingly observant, deft, life-sized. The movie is visually hideous, but the script is astonishingly lively, and some members of the cast burst out at you. As the Shatneresque team leader, the Strobe, Thomas Haden Church is like a concentrated Swat team of extreme earnestness. And there is a lovely scene--not really funny, but you can feel the audience beaming at it--in which a mongoloid space orphan, dandled like a pinhead mascot through most of the movie, takes the stage at a techno nightclub and breakdances to Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me).

The conceit of this film is pure genius make a superhero movie in which there are no battles, and nobody uses their powers; just focus on their personal lives and interpersonal conflicts, and play it mostly for laughs.  I've seen several reviews here for whom that itself is the complaint.  Let them go back to watching Spawn.  Those of you who are able to see the potential in the concept are in for a treat.Going in, I'd only heard of Rob Lowe and Thomas Haden Church, both of whom are excellent.  The surprise is that the rest of the cast keeps step all the way.  They all understand the joke here, which is that they are not in on the joke.  They're funny by way of taking it utterly seriously.  This is not the Airplane of superhero movies.  These people are completely serious about their past exploits and their powers, which we glimpse only briefly, and hear of in conversation.The movie's length is perfect.  It clocks in at under 80 minutes, disappearing long before the idea becomes tired or overused.  I actually wanted to see more, which is far preferable to wishing it were over sooner.  I could actually see a TV series based on this concept.7 out of 10.

For this bunch, it is true and, deep inside, they do know it.  That's, maybe, what actually makes them special.  Their lives are a mix of joy and sorrow, victory and defeat, humor and despair.

Being able to fly, have incredible strength, live forever, and defeat the bad guys is the stuff of many child's dreams.        Popular comics such as Action Comics and Detective Comics brought new creations Superman and Batman to American readers and they soon became part of the national conscience and inspired children the world over for generations to come.      The life of a superhero however is not without its problems. Sure, there are the adoring fans, the admiration of the world, and the great powers, but what about the costs?  There are super villains bent on your destruction, a secret identity to protect, and in many cases a day job to pay the bills.      In `The Specials' we are introduced to a new collection of heroes and learn firsthand how tough it can be to be a superhero and what a burden having superpowers can be.      The Specials are listed as the sixth greatest superhero team in America and when they are not battling bad guys, recruiting new members, or trying to work on their public image, they are one big happy family or so it would seem.  Director Craig Mazin's making his debut film gives us a look into the secret order of superheroes in a film that is part documentary, drama, and comedy.  The Specials are lead by The Strobe (Thomas Haden Church) as he strives to set a good example in the community and fight crime on all levels.  The Strobe is married to Ms. Indestructible (Paget Brewster), a lady who when not fighting at her husbands sides, spends her day answering the phones and paying the bills at the Special's lair, a simple house in a quiet California residential area.          The story opens with the arrival of Nightbird (Jordan Ladd), who as the newest member of the team is finally meeting her partners in the business.  Other than The Strobe and Ms. Indestructible Nightbird has little knowledge of her new team.  There is The Weevil (Rob Lowe) Deadly Girl (Judy Greer), Minute Man (James Gunn), and Amok (Jamie Kennedy).  They all seem friendly towards her as do other members she meets during the course of the day, yet all is not as well as it seems. It turns out that the weight of not having the name recognition that other superhero groups enjoy has put a strain on the team. The strobe is always chastising Amock and The Weevil for their behavior in public as a tabloid has recently published a picture of them smoking in a bathroom stall. The Strobe thinks that this behavior is not only unprofessional, but it hinders their chances to gain respect and thus better work. It seems that the group are only given assignments when other heroes are busy or not interested in the work that is offered.  There are also complaints that names are being mispronounced and that their costumes are not flattering bringing the Strobe's leadership skills into question.      Attempting to improve what looks to be a sinking ship, The Strobe announces that he has come to terms with a toy manufacturer for a line of action figures based on the Specials. It is believed that the toys will not only increase their standings amongst the public and other heroes, but will increase the cash flow for the team.        Sadly things do not go as planned, as The Specials soon find themselves faced with their biggest challenge yet, surviving each other as petty jealousies, personal ambitions, fears and desires soon threaten to rip the group apart.              `The Specials' is a direct to DVD release that while short on special features and effects is filled with originality. Yes the film does not have much of a story, but the film does not take itself to seriously at all and neither should viewers. Instead, it is a interesting slant on what happens to heroes when the cameras are off and how they have to contend with many of the same issues that everyday people do and how their powers can be a hindrance far more than a blessing at times.     Church is great as the Strobe as he presents a leader who is ready to boil over at a moments notice from the pressures he is under both at work and on the homefront.  Lowe is great as the son of the Original Weevil who has issues with his father as well as an offer from a far more established supergroup to ponder as he tries to decide between personal ambitions and loyalty.        I could go on for a while about the various members and their issues but that would spoil the charm of the film. `The Specials' is not for everyone as it is silly film without much in the way of plot. However if you are a fan of comic heroes you may enjoy seeing the dirty laundry being aired and seeing the side of superheroes that the comics don't or cant show.  I for one would liked to have seen more and hope that the film will find an audience on DVD and we may yet hear more from `The Specials' as there is still more of their story to tell. 2.5 stars out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbach  "}{"Title":"Fantastic super hero spoof, incredibly clever!","Date":"6 August 2002","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Fantasy","Review":"  Those who were disappointed with Mystery Men will not waste there money on The Specials!

After reading The Scarecrow Video Guide, I decided to join Netflix and made a list of out-of-the-mainstream movies , and old classics I'd missed. The Specials was the first one I watched.At the time this was made, it's no wonder it didn't get much of a release. Rob Lowe, was still in the early stages of his West Wing comeback, Thomas Hayden Church was a barely remembered sitcom has-been, & Jamie Kennedy was primarily known as the annoying guy from Scream. The rest of the cast was pretty much unknown. (The trailer on the DVD lists Melissa Joan Hart 4th, despite the fact that she appears in exactly one scene.) On top of the cast issues, the plot sounds similar to Mystery Men, which had bombed a year earlier.Now, Lowe is respected again, Kennedy is an above the title star (nevermind the quality of the titles), and Hayden-Church is an Oscar nominee. Meanwhile most of the rest of the cast have become cult TV/film favorites... Sean Gunn from Gilmore Girls, Judy Greer from Arrested Development, Paget Brewster from Andy Richter and Huff, and Jordan Ladd from Cabin Fever and Club Dread.The fun script is what holds it together. Written by (and co-starring) Sean Gunn's brother James halfway between his Troma stint and the unbearable Scooby Doo 2, it's a creative look at the mundane part of being a super-hero. Unlike Mystery Men, which depended too much on special effects, this film has virtually NO action. It's just a series of amusing character pieces. It never really delivers on laughs (except when the gang gets their own action figures), but it's consistently interesting and different. When the film gets to the goofy musical/dance scene so common nowadays, the song featured is not a pop hit, but an obscure 70's novelty song. I found myself grinning ear to ear, despite the fact that it serves NO purpose.The direction is flat, but fitting to the subject matter. All in all, a fun way to spend 90 minutes and certainly worth a rental.Next on my film adventure- Steven Soderburgh's Schitzopolis!

The Specials lately haven't been doing so hot, with lots of infighting, an extramarital affair between the Weevil and Ms. Indestructible, and a new line of toys patterned after then taking their toll on everyone's bruised egos. The Strobe decides to disband the group. Director Craig Mazin maintains a constant snappy pace throughout and does an expert job of creating a dry, yet infectiously zany tone. The funky, catchy soundtrack, Brian Langsbard's stirring score, and Eliot Rockett's polished cinematography are all likewise up to speed. But what really makes this movie so funny and enjoyable are the spirited and engaging performances from the uniformly excellent cast. Moreover, one actually cares about these lovably dysfunctional oddballs; there's a wonderfully moving and amusing camaraderie amongst these complex and appealing all-too-human characters which adds immensely to the film's overall screwball charm.

They don't have the prestige or the money that a group like the Crusaders has. But they've found their niche as the Ringo Starr of superhero teams. There's the Weevil (Rob Lowe), the most popular member and the one pursued by other teams; the blue-skinned, foul-mouthed Amok; Minute (My-noot) Man, who is sensitive about his oft-mispronounced name; the ever-sneering Deadly Girl; the naive and boyish U.S. Bill; the Strobe, the leader of the team; the Strobe's wife, Ms. Indestructible, who is having an affair with the Weevil; the irritatingly perky Power Chick; the green-skinned weirdo, Alien Orphan; the fat and pompous Mr. Smart; and Eight, who has eight different bodies. The new member is a longtime fan who calls herself Nightbird. Unfortunately, she joins just when Cosgrove Toys creates a new line of action figures based on the Specials. The company's disastrous press conference could mean the end to this cut-rate super-group.The Specials is a comedy about superheroes that, thanks to a tiny budget, has no special effects and no scenes where the heroes demonstrate their powers (until the very end). For the filmmakers to have gotten away with this deficiency, they would have needed smart writing and fascinating characters. They had neither. The plot involves a possible dissolution of the super-team, but because everyone is contemptuous of one another, and because no one is especially likable anyway, we're not exactly heartbroken at the idea. The writer, James Gunn (who also plays Minute Man), made no attempt to create believable human beings, even though 82 minutes is too long to spend with shallow parodies of comic book drawings. The gags are paramount, and the gags aren't even funny.The movie earns a certain perverse admiration from us for studiously avoiding the inevitable; and then it ruins even that with a brief, godawful special effects scene at the end that isn't even enjoyably cheesy; it's just bad.

Anyway, I was shocked to see so many negative reviews about this amazing film!  The good reviews I thought were right on target.  It amazes me that so many people equate a good movie with the amount of money in the action and special effects budget.  (But then again...Men In Black made a lot of money, and that's all it had going for it.)  I think it's a funny thing that the characters' makeup was poorly and inconsistently applied and that most of the movie takes place in an average house.  I contend that the poor makeup application was deliberate, and that the lack of action sequences was a joke on all of those people who can't look past them.  I had a really hard time sitting through Mystery Men.  The plot was paper thin and I kept wishing they'd quit those horrible fight scenes and something would actually happen.  The Specials isn't really about superheroes being superheroes, but superheroes being real people.  (I mean, they even have Real World style confessional tapings.  The whole idea of them is ridiculous, but the characters take them seriously.)  The fact that the superheroes take everything so seriously is the source of a lot of the movie's humor.I think the writing and the acting in this movie are both superb. Mystery Men was a silly children's movie, but The Specials is a silly movie for grownups.  Thomas Haden Church, Jamie Kennedy, and James Gunn (the latter of which also wrote the movie) all played their roles perfectly.  The humor is so subtle, yet so obvious.  It is really hard to keep a straight face when Thomas Haden Church is acting seriously.  You can tell the actors had a blast making this movie, and that is really contagious.I'm glad they never fought anybody, although it would have been very interesting.  Fight scenes get boring when you try to watch them more than once, but The Specials is interesting from start to finish.I apologize if I offended any fans of The Cutting Edge, Men In Black, and Mystery Men.

It violates the conventions that one generally expects in this genre.  That's what makes it a work of greatness.James Gunn's brilliant and witty script was not written for the beautiful people of the world, it was created for the oddball, the rebel, the outcast, and the geek. This is the kind of fresh, outlandish script you find yourself quoting to your friends days later.Director Crain Mazin, working on a remarkably small shoe-string budget (that is revealed on the DVD), delivers an enjoyable film that has the courage to turn the focus away from special effects and back onto character. Like Animal House this is groundbreaking comedy.The cast is outstanding.  Jordan Ladd, Judy Greer, Mike Schwartz, Paget Brewster, and Jim Zulevic are not household names, but they should be. They are that good.  They inhabit their characters with such zeal and charm that you'd swear that super-heroes really do live in Silver Lake, California. Thomas Haden Church delivers an incredible performance as The Great Strobe that should be required viewing for any student of acting.I think this fim will develop a cult following like The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  If it's shown at midnight movies the audience will  begin to dress-up like the characters and dance in the aisles when the song Life is a Rock pops up on the soundtrack.

Nope! This seems like a case where the writer got writers block, but kept on typing anyway. And the result was The Specials a truly useless, low budget, default direction, piece of garbage. Few movies on T.V. are so bad that they make the commercials look good, but The Specials wins this prize. I kept on waiting for the movie to start, but was denied for hour upon hour. If you took a lawn chair and set it down on your average sidewalk I can guarantee more laughs and action than this entire movie. I can only imagine that this project was bought and sold to a European distribution market long before the words Fade In were ever written. Thus, the only people who cared about the quality had already paid off their hookers and drug dealers and were vacationing in The Bahamas when critical decisions had to be made. The only folks left were apparently complete novices in the fields of writing, directing and editing. I give them credit for finishing the film in between finishing their high school degrees and bagging groceries at the local costco. Congratulations! Maybe one day you can out go and actually make a film! Won't that be a new experience? This is the lowest of the low and I'm amazed viewers found something redeeming in this film. I've heard more interesting dialog coming through my neighbors fence. I've seen more action at the dog park. I was impressed that Tom Church didn't mail in his performance, like Rob Lowe. Church actually took his job seriously and delivered a performance that can only be described as professional. Sad. He really thought he was making a movie. I'm not sure if that's a good sign or a bad sign. He's deserves credit for earning his money. That's about all that can be said. Rob Lowe, on the other hand, saw through this invisible script from the first line and managed to avoid acting for the entire film. That's no small accomplishment for a role with more dialog than John Adams. Lowe actually mails his performance in from outer space. Maybe from the same planet the alien orphan is from. I'm not sure. Lowe, along with the rest of the cast, recognize that the lack of subtext and emotion and meaning and point to their lines of dialog mean the writer did less work than the guy who makes the coffee. So why act? Why put in the effort? The producer is supposed to have that answer but I guarantee he was long gone by the time the cameras started to role. As I said, the only high points were the commercial interruptions. The rest was absolutely terrible.

Never for an instant does anybody believe any of the guys in this movie have any powers. I think it would've made a huge difference if they had shown one or two shots of members of the Specials using their powers early on to establish their cred as heroes, but they don't and it's impossible for the cast to simulate superpowers, no matter how good they are as actors.The annoying thing about this is that you give $1 million bucks and 18 days to a number of directors, they could turn out something pretty special. Kevin Smith made Clerks for $20K for crissakes, and even considering inflation that would've been maybe $60K in 2000, when this was made.Instead, director Craig Mazin and writer Gunn have given us another bottom-of-the-barrel superhero movie, as if we needed another one of those.It just goes to show how bass ackwards Hollywood can be--if these guys worked in any other business and this was the work they produced, they would be abruptly fired and unable to ever work again in that industry.
