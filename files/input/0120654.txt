[{"Title":"Now They've Made Revenge Funny","Date":"26 February 2006","Score":"38 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" None of the three young stars of this film - Norm MacDonald, Artie Lange or Traylor Howard - ever became movie stars but they combined to make this a funny film, albeit what I call a lame-brain (somewhat low-class but effective humor) one. This is not an untypical comedy of today tons of sleazy jokes, sightgags, a lightweight romance story, a generally stupid story and a happy ending.....yet this one was far more appealing than most I've seen. Although the language could be worse, why this isn't rated R is beyond me. It is not for teens but I'll bet many of them watched and enjoyed this, as well as older people like me. MacDonald is a very likable guy in the lead. He just has a friendly face and demeanor about him. He makes the film. Lange was a bit loud. I'm glad the film wasn't longer because Lange's constant shouting begins to become grating. As for Traylor, she acted well and was a pretty face. After watching this twice, I wondered why she never made it, but at least she has now found TV fame as the new partner of the hit TV series, Monk.Two veterans actors in here - Jack Warden and Chevy Chase - play irreverent sleazy roles, something they certainly have done before.....and do well. Warden is brutal as the ultimate dirty old man and Chase is as smug as always. Don Rickles makes a short appearances as his normal obnoxious character and John Goodman makes a cameo near the end.The main story of this movie is a familiar one revenge, but this time it is played strictly for laughs, and there are plenty. The movie shows revenge isn't just sweet, it can funny. What can you say? The movie is crude, it's sentimental, and it's a fun 82 minutes.

I was shocked to hear this low-brow flick was directed by Bob Saget (Full House). The movie starts off with young Mitch Weaver and his buddy Sam seeking revenge on anybody who crosses their path. Sam's father gets a heart-attack and badly needs money for surgery. Dr. Farthing (Chevy Chase) makes a deal with the boys and if they can cough up a large amount of money to save him from his gambling debt, he will preform surgery on Pops (Jack Warden). Most of the movie is pretty damn funny. Some scenes aren't as funny like The bearded Lady scene, which the movie could have done without in my opinion. The highlight in the movie is no doubt Don Rickles role as the abusive manager of a local movie theater. The movie has no real serious parts in it which is OK; I would love to see Norm in more movies. He truly is talented. Good cast. Lots of Cameos by Ex-SNL members, including the late Chris Farley, the man who had his nose bite off by a whore!

Whoever it was who would give this film a 4/10 star rating obviously is a one-sided dropout who doesn't realize the true meaning and genius in this movie. It was created for one reason and one reason only. To be funny. And by god it was. The great Chris Farley was only able to make but a few entrances but each time he was on screen, he nailed his part and brought more to the screen than what was on the paper. It is a shame a man of his magnitude was never able to show the world around us everything he was capable of. As for Chevy Chase, some may say his part showed up a little bit dry. Which it did, but this was not because of a poor script. This simply is because Chevy Chase's style of humor is that more of the early to late 70's. His performance overall was pretty good and I personally enjoyed it but the fact is he was unable to creatively fulfill himself in this film. The poor acting is made up for by having a non-stop comedy story board. This film ceases to have a dull moment and this largely can be credited to Norm MacDonald and his very unique style of comedy. Norm has always been a different kind of comedian who has different views on what he believes is funny. In this film, he is successfully able to transfer his hysterical notions to the lucky viewers of this film.

The problem with most stupid comedies is they try to go for legitimate laughs, and simply come off as ridiculous. Anyone who's familiar with Norm MacDonald's brand of humor shouldn't be surprised. If you hate the guy, you probably won't like this movie, as he did co-write the script as well as being the star. So if you're a Norm-hater, you can stop reading this now.This is one of those movies where no matter how many times I watch it, I'm still able to crack up at the same stupid jokes. There's a ton of lines that I love to quote from the movie. One of those hilarious lines occurs during the dead hooker scene. Norm says, I've never seen so many dead hookers in my life, and a creepy guy in the crowd comments, Lord knows I have. The Saigon whore line is also hilarious And there's the Saigon whore...that bit my nose off! Aaaahhhh! In the movie, the late and great Chris Farley plays a guy...who got his nose bitten off by a Saigon whore. I know. Pretty self-explanatory. Farley doesn't play a huge role, but he steals the show every minute he's on screen. And of course, there's Norm's great Maybe you'll feel better after we have some dirty sex line.I like Norm MacDonald, because he says the most ridiculous things, but delivers them in almost a deadpan fashion. There are, of course, moments in the film that are just plain stupid. And seeing Rebecca Romijn with a beard is too disturbing for my taste. But the pros definitely outweigh the cons in this stupidly hilarious comedy that I hope becomes a cult classic someday. One thing's for sure You will never see another movie containing a barfight with The Pina Colada Song playing on the jukebox.

Many do not understand that his blunt, sometimes bombastic delivery is his trademark comedic style. While I would never call his style, genius, he is certainly a master entertainer, in his own right. This style of his is an acquired taste. If you've managed to live your life without becoming the least bit jaded or cynical of anything, you may not understand Mr. Mcdonald's talent for humor. His coloring of even the most innocent scene with a dark innuendo or low-brow blurb is just so outrageous that we have no choice but to laugh. But those who do not understand, will find him abrasive or crass. It's true; he IS abrasive and crass, and in the most unfortunate situations he lets loose his abrasively crass innuendos and utters the most outrageous statements as facts only to correct himself by posing it as a question after he's already blurted out the first silly, obnoxious thing which comes to his mind. All this is assembled together with his honest expressions, common-everyday-Joe appearance, and expert comedic timing. Packaged within unlikely settings and a professional production, Norm Macdonald's comedic style is in the perfect element.Dirty Work enlists the largest range of Norm Macdonald's skills of any one work I have seen. It is virtually a showcase for his talent. Unfortunately, it is commonly viewed as mindless, low-brow, Hollywood fluff and will therefore never receive the full appreciation of the audiences it deserves. The casual movie-goer will not be in on some of his one-liners, and the hard core comedic fans will be too busy critiquing his innovative comedic style to appreciate it.This work involves Chevy Chase as an unscrupulous in-debt gambler who is willing to help our star out of his latest pickle in exchange for a load of money. I was a tad disappointed with Chevy's role in this vehicle. It could have afforded Mr. Chase's legendary talents a bit more respect by way of screen time. I found his talents were sorely under used although the drivers were pistoned after his specific flair. I did not quite agree with this decision.All in all, this is a beautiful introduction to Norm Macdonald's talents and I highly suggest its viewing.It rates a 7.3/10 from...the Fiend .

I wouldn't call him a genius like Mel Brooks or Woody Allen, but he knows how to do comedy and he knows how to make people laugh--Well, he knows how to make ME laugh.  Sometimes you see humor that's so dumb and meaningless that it makes you crack up.  That is demonstrated again and again in Dirty Work.  For example, the scene at the movie theater.  Norm and Artie took revenge on their evil boss by showing a movie called Men in Black...Who Like to Have Sex with Each Other.  OK, so this is not humor that was thought of with sheer ingenuity.  But I was cracking the hell up!  There are all sorts of different angles you can take towards humor.  You can't always tell which is the best angle.  When you watch an action movie, a drama, a thriller, a mystery or almost any other genre, you look for intelligence and wit.  But when you watch a comedy there's two factors--at least there should be two factors--and those are  you laugh or you don't laugh.  And different things make different people laugh.  So I don't appreciate haters of this movie claiming this is no more than an insult to one's intelligence.  You don't need intelligence for comedy. As long as a comedy makes me laugh, I'm satisfied, and I laughed A LOT!!!I'm glad this movie received a cult following.  This wasn't a big hit in mainstream cinema, but lots of friends I know love this movie--some thought it was the funniest comedy of all time.  So my recommendation is split You might like it, you might not like it.  Just check it out, there's no harm. Unless you're easily offended by jokes about obesity and homosexuality.

Then they get the bright idea of opening up their own business--one that will get revenge for a price. The acts of revenge are among the funniest things about the film. I especially loved how he got revenge on the loud neighbors and the sleazy car salesman. There were some serious negatives in the film such as quite a few flat jokes here, the unfunny bit where MacDonald makes notes to himself on a tape recorder (it was overdone on SNL--it was even worse here) and there was the ending--it seemed to end way too quickly and the resolution wasn't particularly satisfying compared to the earlier parts of the film.However, this film has the phrase guilty pleasure written all over it. While the film has many flat moments, crude jokes and horrible messages, it did make me laugh and laugh--and that's the most important positive about the film. I know I should be ashamed of myself, but you can't ignore a film that puts a smile on your face like this stupid movie did. In addition, I hate to admit that I also laughed at MacDonald's other critically scathed film SCREWED. I feel so dirty--these are NOT deep or sophisticated films and they abound with juvenile humor--but they make me laugh.By the way, keep note of all the unusual supporting actors that appeared in this film such as Chevy Chase, Don Rickles, Adam Sandler, Chris Farley and Jack Warden (among others). Obviously, there were a lot of folks out there that liked MacDonald and wanted to help him with this film.

That's really the only reason, as the previews did nothing to entice me  otherwise, and I assumed it would be another awful movie.   I also have an  unfathomable hatred for Bob Saget's work, but for some reason I still went  to see this.   I have to say I was, in a way, pleasantly surprised.Yes, this movie is insanely stupid.   However, as I had hoped, Norm  MacDonald's comedic genius did get a few chances to peak through.

Very funny, in parts. I like Norm MacDonald a lot, despite his inability to act his detached, smirking and insincere persona makes me laugh even when he's not saying anything. The plot, in which Norm and best pal Artie Lange set up a revenge-for-hire business, is complete nonsense but it's practically irrelevant anyway, as it's just an excuse for a series of slapstick gags and occasionally inspired stupidity.Not all of it works. Any scenes featuring Chris Farley consist of a hollow wind and the distant barking of a lonesome dog. The direction is hopelessly flat, while the editing seems designed to undercut any sense of comedic timing; the whole thing is styleless, taking place in an airless environment with very little background noise and sets that look exactly like sets. And the romance angle is so anaemic it's hard not to feel sorry for Traylor Howard, working with such an underwritten role.The movie has a line in crudity at odds with the bland presentation. There's a really tasteless scene in prison where Norm is led off by a group of convicts and returns having apparently been gang raped; it upsets whatever tone had been established until that point, and while Norm's understated complaining about the whole thing (Ridiculous!) is funny, the scene is just&#x85; weird. The whole movie could have done with being ratcheted up to this level, if only for consistency's sake; as it is it feels compromised, as if it was originally far dirtier than the finished product.Hit and miss, then, but worth watching if only for the running gag with Norm getting thrown face first onto the pavement, which never gets old.

He knows the plot is nonsense. He knows the love interest is a throwaway mandatory subplot. He knows the dialogue is terrible, terrible stuff. And he knows he can't act. He doesn't care.And so in a way this is a very subversive genre film, because it takes the then-popular SNL-actor-adaptation formula of flicks such as Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison (which, at the time, before Superstar and Night at the Roxbury ended the fashion, was a guaranteed-profit machine) and just basically makes fun of it for 82 minutes. Yes, Sandler and other SNL actors make brief cameos but this is better than most of the typical SNL films. (Off the top of my head, I think only Happy Gilmore really works as well, and not for the same reasons.) Maybe I'm prejudiced in the film's favor because I love Norm MacDonald. I think he's one of the most hilarious men to ever grace the earth. But he's funnier with on-the-spot, unrehearsed stuff. (As evidenced by his appearance on Conan a few years ago, which Conan in retrospect claimed was the funniest interview he'd ever done.) He often appears on talk shows acting completely drunk, stoned, and out of his mind. At first it appears that he's just rambling, but it's a carefully practiced style of comedy and you either love it or hate it. I love it.His acerbic wit propels Dirty Work. It's just fun watching him, even though once the film's over it's very clear why he never made it as a major film star he doesn't have the same qualities as Sandler. He isn't content with making garbage and trying to pass it off as good comedy. He hates the formula and, in fact, commercials for Dirty Work were banned by NBC after Norm was deemed not funny by the vice president of NBC at the time (who fired Norm from the Weekend Updates).Don't misunderstand me. This movie's not that great. And Norm is out of place - visibly so. But this is what makes it work. The prison sex scene is treated so nonchalantly and with such self-mockery that you just *know* these guys were making fun of this movie the whole time. Artie Lange, Don Rickles, Jack Warden, and Chevy Chase in one of his few truly funny film roles. And it's directed by Bob Saget for goodness sake.Sarcastic, self-loathing, acerbic, witty, brutal, and consumed by hatred. Not your typical Saturday Night Live movie. And I'm glad it didn't turn a profit because I'd hate to have to see Norm MacDonald stuck pretending to enjoy doing this for a living. Watching him show up on the Daily Show stirring controversy is a lot more fun and more in-tune with what he's all about. He's misunderstood but the public have a pretty good record of popularizing talentless people.

Artie Lange and Norm MacDonald either helped write this script, or else they really took it and made it their own, and they are two pretty funny guys.But there's more. There's Jack Warden's brilliant performance as the crusty old father, Don Rickles' classic scene with Artie Lange, an appropriately not-quite-over-the-top and enjoyable performance by Chevy Chase who appears in a few scenes without stealing them, and Chris Farley putting in a fine performance in this his final film. All are funny and entertaining in their own ways, but this is clearly Norm MacDonald's and Artie Lange's movie.One quibble would be with Traylor Howard's uneven performance as the love interest. Probably not the greatest actress, but she's nice to look at.This is one of the top 25 all-time classic lowbrow-style comedies, and one of the five best of the 90's. It has a pretty unique style in terms of its comedy, thanks largely to Norm MacDonald and Artie Lange. There is no way this film deserves less than an 8 from anyone. It's one thing to not like an entire genre, but this film is obviously a near-total success at what it set out to do--to make us laugh frequently. As I write, this film has an average rating of 5.9, making this one of the more underrated films here, and another example of the ratings at IMDb meaning very little.

He was in The Replacements, Problem Child 1 and 2, and a few other good movies.I wasn't really a big fan of Norm MacDonald (except for the Bob Dole impersonation) and his weekend update bit on Saturday Night Live but he is very funny in Dirty Work.

While MacDonald may be an acquired taste, his deadpan delivery can pretty much make any joke hysterical. MacDonald's unapologetically un-PC brand of comedy combined with his dry delivery can make people uncomfortable. His Weekend Update segments on SNL were consistently controversial, but also consistently hilarious. After being fired from SNL, movies seemed like the best next step for MacDonald. Unfortunately, his first starring role in Dirty Work didn't pan out quite like MacDoanld or his fans would have liked. The film was a box office failure, and pretty much derailed MacDonald's film career as a leading man. However, a film's box office is not a fair measurement of a film's quality. Some of the most memorable comedies of all time have been box office failures. While I won't say Dirty Work is an all time cinema classic, I will defend it as something close to a comedic masterpiece. It's an off-the-charts stupid comedy with plot holes and obvious editing galore, but it is also, above all else, one of the funniest comedies ever made.The most surprising part of Dirty Work is that was directed by Bob Saget. The knowledge that the guy who made hundreds of corny jokes on Full House is responsible for one of the most side-splitting comedies of all time is fairly hard to believe. What makes Dirty Work such a joy is the confidence Saget shows as a director. There is never a moment in which the movie retreats from what it is a dumb, raunchy comedy determined to go for most low-brow joke possible at every turn. The film is absolutely juvenile in the best way, and knows it. The film never tries to be something it's not. Every scene is filled with crude humor, somewhat obvious jokes, and easy targets. But every scene is also filled with memorable lines delivered by actors who know exactly what type of comedy they are starring in, for better of worse. Norm MacDonald and Artie Lange are aware they are not the world's greatest actors, so any moment that would usually require a convincing emotion is almost immediately undercut with a dirty joke. Any scene that could fall flat is instantly beefed up by a celebrity cameo by the likes of Adam Sandler, Gary Coleman, John Goodman, Don Rickles etc. Bob Saget is completely aware of how awful certain scenes could be, and does everything to ensure that every scene is better than it has any right to be by simply providing another solid joke at every turn.The flaws of Dirty Work are completely apparent. The editing for the PG-13 rating is hard to ignore, especially in the jail scene. The pacing is almost too quick. And, although it's certainly not the fault of the filmmakers, it would have been nice if the last film of Chris Farley released in theaters contained slightly more of him. Despite the obvious imperfectness of the film, it's hard for me not to love it. I could probably watch this movie every day of my life without tiring of it. It's one of the few movies that gets funnier every time I watch it. There's no comedy that deserves a special edition DVD or Blu Ray release than this one.

Speaking as a fan of Macdonald, I've always just loved his delivery. The man could say practically anything, and I'd still chuckle. Here he works with other comedy pros and established actors to create a gleefully un-P.C., ridiculous movie that's just fun from beginning to end.Co-written by Macdonald, Dirty Work stars him as Mitch, kind of a loser in life who finally realizes what he's best at getting revenge when somebody does him wrong. Together with his best friend Sam (Artie Lange), he decides that this will be his line of work. However, they do need to come up with $50,000 rather quickly to pay a gambling addict doctor (Chevy Chase) to pull some strings to get Sams' dad 'Pops' (Jack Warden) a new heart. Trouble brews when rich bastard Travis Cole (Christopher McDonald) plays Mitch and Sam for fools and some innocent people get booted out of their homes. So the two buddies save the best revenge of all for the nefarious Cole.Examples of the kinds of lunacy in this movie include dead prostitutes in car trunks, frat boys tricked into picking a fight with cops, the raunchy spin on Men in Black that Mitch and Sam play at a theatre, Mitchs' frequent notes to self dictations into a pocket tape recorder, and a highly unlikely choice of music for a fight scene in a bar. Macdonald does alright in his first lead, and isn't bad when he's required to actually act. Lange makes for a good sidekick. It's nice to see veteran Warden be so feisty (and randy). Traylor Howard is cute as the requisite love interest. McDonald is perfect in the kind of jerk role that he was clearly born to play. Don Rickles has fun doing his traditional insult humour as a crabby movie theatre owner. David Koechner has a small role as the proprietor of a car dealership. And there are assorted lively cameos by a couple of familiar faces. The verbal and visual jokes keep coming and everything is wrapped up within a very reasonable 82 minutes. Best of all, there's a few outtakes to enjoy during the end credits.This is one of those riotous movies that can hold up to repeat viewings, especially if one is an admirer of any of the comedic talent here.

That kind of thesis for a comedy is almost always lethal because we get no opportunities for humanity or genuine laughs since the film constantly feels the dreary obligation to one-up itself. Here's a film that is so perfunctory and foreseeable in its setups and deliveries that I'd be convinced if the screenwriter and the director thought of this film over a coffee break and decided to carry out everything right then and there.The film was directed by Bob Saget, who you'd know as the whitest, cleanest, and most supportive sitcom daddy in existence on the classic program Full House. Saget is famous for leading a life contradicting to his clean-persona on the show, often performing the filthiest, crassest standup you're likely to ever hear. For this reason, it is unsurprising his directorial effort plays much like his standup in terms of predictably raunchy material that lacks heart and craft.The film follows Mitch Weaver (Norm Macdonald) and Sam McKenna (Artie Lange), two lifelong buddies who have gone their entire lives exacting revenge on people for the smallest offenses. They stage elaborate attacks on the people they can't stand in order to gain a small sense of satisfaction. When Sam's father (Jack Warden) has a heart attack and is in need of a heart transplant, the guys learn the doctor can get the man immediate attention if they pay off the doctor (Chevy Chase) $50,000 so that he can pay off his enormous gambling debt.They decide to open a revenge business called Dirty Work, which thrives off of people calling in and getting Mitch and Sam to exact revenge on people that make their callers tick. One of the reasons the film doesn't work is that the attacks are simple and, overall, underwhelming. With more intricate planning and craft, the payoffs for these offenses could've been rewarding and hilarious. Instead, they are childish and redundant.It also doesn't help that Mitch and Sam are two of the most archetypal, cliché protagonists in any comedy I've ever seen. They're so thin, wooden, and void of personality they feel like robots programmed to do and say things that are allegedly funny. Macdonald and Lange are average comedic talents, and here, they can't do too much with the script (which was somehow the product of three people) that forbids and character or development from sneaking past the abundance of clichés and predictable plot lines.Even so-called late night comedies and stoner films need to achieve some sort of quality and Dirty Work doesn't possess the characteristics of being memorable or creative enough to achieve them. It is an overly-silly, ridiculous film that gets even more ridiculous when it feels the need to allow plot lines like romance and fighting to elbow themselves into the picture. Saget may have craft when it comes to juggling personas, but he also shows that he has talent for making one of the most frustrating comedies of the nineties I have yet to see.Starring Norm Macdonald, Artie Lange, Jack Warden, and Chevy Chase.

I love silly  and sometimes stupid movies...It just reinforces my belief that MacDonalds'  humor is meant for adults.  Who knows? Maybe his next effort will be a little more 'mature'?

I'm not surprised that many hate this movie, because if you want to get critical, there are definitely some flaws.

Norm MacDonald plays Mitch Weaver, who along with buddy Sam McKenna (Artie Lange) become an unusual pair of entrepreneurs by starting a revenge for hire business. Soon business takes off as the guys sabotage homes, get even with mean bosses and turn a housing development into something of a ghetto. All this to (comedy cliché alert) raise money for an operation for Sam's ailing father.The brand of humor in Dirty Work is the sort that plays to our immaturity, much like the early Adam Sandler pictures such as Billy Madison and Happy Gimore. The film also has an appealing enough story that it moves along at a slick pace even when it's not uproarious. Judging by the box office results for Dirty Work, it seems MacDonald's act is lost on many filmgoers. But if you're one of those who finds him hilarious, there's no doubt you'll have a great time with Dirty Work.

Mitch (Norm MacDonald), our hero, seems to have no other talents other than getting back at people. Sam (Artie Lange) is his lifelong buddy. I was surprised by Artie Lange's acting ability. There was one scene where he got angry at MacDonald, and I thought Lange did a pretty good job. Jack Warden plays Sams' father, and his character seemed to me to be one note, a horny old man. Traylor Howard, as Kathy, Mitch's love interest, was barely there. She was given too much to do. The direction by Bob Saget was competent, nothing outstanding. And except for some very funny moments, nothing was really laugh out loud. I noticed that a shooting star was in the background during a scene where Mitch and Sam are talking on a rooftop. Maybe I'm jaded, but I thought it was a special effect, but then I thought, why bother with such a meaningless special effect (unless it has some symbolism only known to the film makers)? Anyway, not a terrible way to spend 90 minutes, but I would recommend not going out of your way to see this one.

The story is almost ridiculously simplistic, but it doesn't matter.  It serves only as a vehicle for Norm's remarkably funny brand of humor.-PLOT SETUP- Having lost his latest in a string of lousy jobs, as well as his girlfriend (who grew tired of dating a loser), Mitch Weaver (MacDonald) is forced to live with his lifelong best friend, Sam (Artie Lange).  But when Sam's intimidating, horny father (Pops) has a heart attack, Sam asks Mitch to help him raise a quick $50,000 so that the old man's shady, gambling addict of a doctor (Chevy Chase) will bump him to the top of the donor list. With Pops on his possible deathbed, he admits to Mitch that he is really Mitch's father and that the two best friends are actually half-brothers.  Keeping this secret from Sam, Mitch wants to do everything he can to help raise the money, but can't seem to find a way.  The two make several futile attempts to earn some fast cash, but Norm soon figures out that the only thing he is good at is getting revenge on people who give him crap.  Thus, Dirty Work, an inventive revenge-for hire business, is founded.  Hilarious consequences ensue.There are so many funny moments in this movie that to try and name any would be silly.  It is sometimes crude, often ridiculous, but always hilarious. Norm MacDonald is a genius, and his delivery is masterful.  Don't listen to naysayers if you at all enjoy comedies that are stupidly smart, blatantly subtle and mindlessly witty.

Chris Farley's portrayal of the victim of a nose-biting Saigon whore is of course remarkable, and the nameless man in the audience of Don Giovanni who absolutely loves the guys' remake of the classic opera is a masterful addition.

Norm MacDonald, in perhaps the role of a lifetime as Mitch (a role, I'm sure, the likes of DeNiro or Pacino would *kill* for) absolutely turns in a performance that should result in no less than an Oscar for Best Actor.  If MacDonald should get bypassed for this award (let's face it, the nomination is already sewed up), it would be the biggest upset since Henry Fonda was bypassed in 1940 for the Best Actor nod for his Tom Joad in the Grapes of Wrath (a role that eerily draws parallels to MacDonald's portrayal of Mitch).The bulletproof plot (I won't spoil it by going into many details, but I will say that the opera scene exhibits the type of class this movie truly exudes), perfectly crafted dialogue, as well as the superior supporting performances of Artie Lange (another Oscar shoe-in), Jack Warden, the great Don Rickles (showing his great acting range in yet another Oscar-worthy performance), Gary Coleman, the late-great Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, and even former heavyweight champ Ken Norton chip in with great bit performances, adding to the tapestry that is this wonderful movie.  Bob Saget gets to spread his wings with this project, and once he secures his Best Director Oscar for Dirty Work, one can place him alongside Coppola, Spielberg, and yes, Ingmar Bergman, as a true directorial genius.

Well, if you're a Norm MacDonald fan, it's great... all others beware.  Full of the most un-PC humor, this film aims pretty low, but succeeds on that level (it's not trying to be Annie Hall, people).  The plot and romantic sub-plot with Traylor Howard are, at best, totally forgettable, but the filmmakers could care less.  Despite Bob Saget's uber-blandeness on network TV, he was a VERY dirty, very funny stand-up way-back-when, and was a great choice to direct - he does a nice job.  Expert comics like Rickels, Warden, & ex-SNL alumni David Koechner, Adam Sandler, & Chris Farley all make appearances.  MacDonald is great (but no actor) and Lange is good, too. Just turn your mind off and laugh.  How can you hate a film where more than half the punchlines involve the word whore in them?

The whole storyline seems created out of convenience, never strong enough to make the audience care. Only a few laughs come out of this boring story and script and are mostly due to MacDonald's dry humour.The cameos of Chevy Chase, Chris Farley and Adam Sandler are all wasted, not using each to the best of their abilities. I wonder if Chevy ever saw the finished product of this film. Because if he did, he would have surely asked for his part to be cut. Chase has no funny lines in the entire film even though they are all meant to be funny. Same goes for Farley, other than his final scene,, his role isn't at all funny. The ending of this film is pathetic, causing one to question if Mr. Saget ran out of film, MGM lost patience or MacDonald just got sick of being boring. Dirty Work is good for a few crude laughs, but still a waste of an hour and a half.4/10 stars.

He was shafted by NBC for making too many O.J. jokes, and that is a shame. He is a genuinely funny person.  But this movie doesn't do him any good. Norm plays a guy who starts a business that exacts revenge on a client's enemies.  The story just doesn't work--one try gags rapped around sexual activities might work for a skit, but to stretch it into a long movie it fails.  And seeing Norm's character fall in love, and try to get the girl, well, it just doesn't work. I swear this happened when we saw the movie as the show ended, a woman in back muttered The real dirty trick would be to tell someone to go see this... and she was right.  Even Norm fans will be disappointed.I hope Norm makes it back to some success...he's got a TV show on one of the broadcast networks (CBS, I think) and his does have a good sense of humor.

It features truly appalling acting - the lead character is a horrid mix of the worst aspects of Billy Crystal, Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, only far worse than you can imagine. Every line is delivered flat and incompetently - like the dead hookers sequence. It's cringe-inducing. The humour is not only mentally challenged it treats the audience like it's ESN - every joke is spelt out so no-one is left in any doubt. For instance, the bearded lady gets shaved, so we see the result, see the word bearded being deleted but to cap it off we get the dwarf saying she lost her beard. Thanks for that, I really needed that gag explained 3 ways! And the drug shoot out is so painful it's sadomasochistic to watch - like the whole film. And the dead hookers scene? Genius! Of course live TV would air that sort of rubbish, and it was just so funny, and not misogynistic one bit.
