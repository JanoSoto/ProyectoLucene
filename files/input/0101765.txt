Perhaps most lauded for his monumental Three Colors trilogy, Kieslowski first explored themes of duality, synchronicity, and fate in this cinematic reverie. Irène Jacob, also the star of Red, handles a double role as two women cut from the same metaphysical cloth -- the Polish Veronika and the French Véronique. Her presence as both women is at once whimsically childlike and sensually melancholic; relentlessly alluring, it is easy to see why she became Kieslowski's muse. Jacob is perfectly fluid in the shift between characters, an embodiment of ideal femininity, as dreamlike as the tone of the entire film.Actor and director are symbiotic, relying on hazy, autumnal ambiance and mood for narrative, utilizing a subtle minimalist approach to dialogue. This is fine art, unlike heavy-handed Hollywood productions. The tone is consistently ambiguous -- emotionally resonant, to be sure, but beyond a vaguely somber, wistful undercurrent, the movie allows the viewer to fill the empty space with his or her own thoughts and feelings. It's a true testament to Kieslowski's mastery, and few films are ever so transcendentally sublime.The lack of this masterpiece's availability on DVD is a sad affair. There are rumors of a release in 2005, but for fans of movies like Amélie hungry for something with a little more depth, The Double Life of Véronique comes most highly recommended -- even if you have to search high and low for a copy on VHS.

I think the film is more accessible for european viewers, the same way Dawn by law might be for american viewers (I can´t bear that pretentious american underground movies at all, with cool men swearing all the time, trying to be funny... I can´t identify with most of nineties american characters). There are many american art house films buffs as well, so I can´t say this is a general fact, it´s just my view anyway.Regarding the development of the characters, Tsylia probably couldn´t understand at the beginning of the film how both women are described so poeticly. Weronicka is watching at the stars, while Veronique is watching the leaves fall. I see this is not evident but it  says a lot about the two. Weronicka is more spiritual, magical, and Veronique is more practical, more down to earth. If you cannot see the metaphores throughout the film you will not grasp anything about the development of the characters, that´s for sure. Furthermore, Irene Jacob performance is sublime, you can see on her face so many difficult to express sensations, she´s not just a beautiful face as it has been stated below (I can name hundreds of pretty american girls on stupid films, I was shocked to read Irene Jacob is just pretty, couldn´t these people see she´s a valuable actress as well). In any case she´s pretty in the sense Catherine Deneuve is, I mean she´s not the common beatiful woman, you can see by his gestures that she feels alone in the world, that she feels the fullness of life, ... She sometimes seems like an angel in this film (Weronicka).I´m an atheist, but I admit the religious or spiritual feeling of the film engages anyone. The film evokes the idea that gifted people such this soprano singer have a spare part somewhere in the world, the same way the puppetier has a spare marionette for the one he uses most.God is not mentioned but the scenes are revealing Veronique caresses the bark of a thick tree in the very last scene, which could signify her real father as well, or just the idea of fatherhood.The music is ten out of ten, if you feel nothing while listening to Preisner´s masterpiece, you´d better not say you´re sensitive anymore. This is his best for me alongside with the music for Short story of a killing and Damage soundtrack which sounds cruel and mysterious to me.I can´t think of any other film more precious and lyrical than this one.

Just like in Trois Couleurs Bleu, the music of La Double vie de Véronique is very indivisible from the film the visual and the auditive form a united whole and also elements of it are directly part of the story. And when it comes to music made for film, Zbigniew Preisner's powerful score for this one is as good as it gets.When there is little dialogue, it is not just the images and expressions on Irène Jacob's face that tells the story, but also the powerful strains of music intermingled with it.Even with just these elements in place, it would be a movie worth seeing, though obviously a narrative based in little extent on dialogue and with less emphasis on a clear-cut story than your average American movie is unfortunately lost on some of the earlier commentators.And even this seemingly sparingly laid out narrative reveals itself to the careful watcher to be a rich tapestry of symbols, metaphors and hidden meanings. Kiéslowski, just as in his other movies, demands participation of the viewer, and the one who expects passive entertainment has found the wrong film to watch.Krzysztof never liked discussing meaning when it came to his movies, but liked keeping that up to the viewers, and few other directors have ever been able to lay out more food for thought and fruitful interpretation than him.I saw the Three Colours trilogy before seeing Véronique, and the many similarities, both musical and in visual narrative, makes it feel like it almost belongs together with those three to form a quartet. In some ways it has more in common with Blue than Red and White do. Had Juliette Binoche also been cast in the role of Véronique, as I understand that Krzysztof originally had intended, the similarities had been even greater. She was, however, occupied with shooting Les Amants du Pont-Neuf at the time I believe, and so Krzysztof opted for the less experienced Irène. I don't think the film is any worse for it she is brilliant, and not just a pretty face as some people put it, but a very intelligent and aware actress as anyone who has seen her interview for the Red DVD release should discover if they haven't already.In short a wonderful film, wonderful music, great acting. But not a movie for everyone.

At one point she handed the weary savior a cloth to wipe his face on. He did so, and when he handed it back to her, there was imprinted an image of his face on the cloth. The name Veronica, indeed, is a corruption of the Latin vero icon - the true image (yes, a contradiction in terms, I know). When Kieslowski's Veronika is unknowingly walking to her death, that is, to the audition that will lead to it, the French Veronique unknowingly photographs her from the bus in the Krakow square, while frantically trying to get snapshots from the ongoing riot.Veronika, of course, ends up straining herself too hard singing, and because of her heart condition, snuffs it while singing those beautiful lines from Dante's Paradisio, about the ascent to heaven. Veronique, in turn, for some reason realizes that she has to give up her own singing career, and, seemingly without a single moment of regret, instead dedicates herself to teaching the music of Van den Budenmaier to untalented, bratty schoolchildren. There is little doubt, after watching the movie, that the Polish Veronika did indeed, somehow, die so that the French Veronique might live.The opening sequence of the movie also contains the outline of Christ's life. Veronika is shown the star that will start Chrismas Eve (oh, the horrifically nonsensical astronomy we teach our children... but I digress. ;-) ), and immediately afterwords we are taken to France, where the child Veronique is being told about the leaves of spring. Christmas is the birth of Christ, while spring is the time of Easter, and his suffering and death.So, is this, indeed, Kieslowski's very radical, and breathtakingly beautiful, take on the story of the suffering of Christ? Discuss, class. ;-) "},{"Title":"Beautiful haunting storytelling","Date":"1 December 2003","Score":"34 out of 42 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Music","Review":"  I still listen to the haunting music that weaves it's way through this film and it never fails to move me.

The Double life of Véronique is not a film that allows easy description, it doesn't seem to fit in to any genre or category, it is a film that must be experienced under it's own terms, as a serious, hypnotic work of art. Director Kieslowski sets up the odd dreamlike atmosphere right from the start, using mirror reflections and odd camera distortions to show us the bizarre way that Veronique/Veronika sees the world around her. The use of sepia printing also gives the film an odd distilled look, taking us right out of any real reality, giving each of the frames something special. The problem this creates is that it takes away any real connection we have with the characters, we never really feel anything for them or are even that concerned for their outcomes, Kieslowski moves his actors around his stage in the same way the marionettes are manipulated in the film, but the film works on such a subtly hypnotic level I don't think that Kieslowski ever wanted us to feel part of this world. Kieslowski follows Veronique/Veronika through Paris and Poland, intimately probing her with close, hand-held camera, the cinema-verite effect of this making the viewer feel almost like a voyeur, following the women's every movements and encounters. The Double Life of Veronique is a film that definitely deserves to be seen and requires multiple viewings if we are to get everything out of it's complex, pre-destined narrative. A film full of beautiful images and haunting moods that you'll remember long after, if only there had been a little more focus on the characters I would certainly give it a 10. Maybe my next viewing will lift its marks. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Split Alice","Date":"16 November 2008","Score":"26 out of 29 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Music","Review":" I save films. By that I mean that some films I expect to be so precious that I want to save them for some future drought, or blue period where I need spiritual insulin. Or it may be that a valued filmmaker has died and I know there is only so much to see new and I want to pace it through my life.Kieslowski is something of a demigod in my film world. It isn't that he has mattered so much in the sense of affecting me. Its because he can push geography with the slightest touch, infer emotional richness with the most subtle of motions, show us beauty headon &#151; headon without artifice. His the most delicate power I know in cinema. His Decalogue is complex, open, engineered to be contradictory in ways that seem natural. But they are not where the real juice is. Its merely where he worked out the way to weave vision and narrative conflict with his companion and creative partner.It's Three Colors where it pays off. These are miraculous and I wish them on any open soul. They will tear you gently in ways you will not notice for years, and then know all of a sudden when you meet someone.In between Decalogue and Colors, we have this, essentially an adventure in moving from Polish to French vocabulary, both emotional and chromatic. Here we see some of the strokes we will encounter later, in one colored film even with the remarkable Irene. But he seems unsure here. Things aren't integrated between cinema and narrative as they were before and would be afterward. The eye doesn't inform with curious discovery, instead seems to glance around and hover. I suppose it is because the story isn't well developed in the way that others are. The deal with Kieslowski I think (beyond the beauty) is that he is able to infer future urges that probably will loop back into places and persons we see. (He closes a very few of these ordinary loops in the third colors film). But he never closes them, not the ones that matter. So we are left with our own emotions going ahead and anticipating results that matter to us, things started and not finished, breath sent out for us to catch and breath.This film is based on Alice in through the Lookingglass, with a number of less-than-deft fixtures to the source. He tries to build grand arcs of anticipated futures around this symmetry but they aren't fragile and supported by our wishes as we have elsewhere. I think it was simply a time of adjustment for him, and I cannot recommend this, even though I saved it for decades. I will suggest that if you do watch it, see the same story, the same emotional effects, the same tantalizing near-closure in Sex and Lucia by someone less gifted with the eye, but more gifted with the mysteries of women. Watch out for the delicate tearing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.

If you've never seen her, this is an excellent place to begin. She has an earnest, open quality about her that is innocent and sophisticated at the same time so that everything a man might want in a young woman is realized in her. Part of her power comes from Kieslowski himself who has taught her how she should act to captivate. He has made her like a little girl fully grown, yet uncorrupted, natural, generous, kind, without pretension, unaffected. She is a dream, and she plays the dream so well.The movie itself is very pretty, but somewhat unaffecting with only the slightest touch of blue (when the puppeteer appears by the curtain, the curtain is blue, and we know he is the one, since she is always red). The music by Zbignew Preisner is beautiful and lifts our spirits, highlighted by the soprano voice of Elzbieta Towarnicka. But the main point is Iréne Jacob, whom the camera seldom leaves. We see her from every angle, in various stages of dress and undress, and she is beautiful from head to toe. And we see her as she is filled with the joy of herself and her talent, with the wonder of discovery and the wonder of life, with desire, and with love.Obviously this is not a movie for the action/adventure crowd. Everything is subtle and refined with only a gross touch or two (and no gore, thank you) to remind us of the world out there. Véronique accepts the little crudities of life with a generous spirit, the flasher, the two a.m. call, her prospective lover blowing his nose in front of her... She loves her father and old people. She is a teacher of children. She climaxes easily and fully. To some no doubt she is a little too good to be true. And she is, and that is Kieslowski's point she is a dream. And such a beautiful dream.An actress playing the character twice in a slightly different way has occurred in at least two other films in the nineties there was Patricia Arquette in David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors (1998). It's an appealing venture for an actress of course and when the actress is as talented as these three are, for the audience as well.Note that as Weronika/Véronique is in two worlds, Poland and France, so too has always been Kieslowski himself in his real life. It is interesting how he fuses himself with his star. This film is his way of making love to her.Kieslowski died in 1996 not long after finishing his celebrated trilogy, Trois Couleurs Bleu (1993); Rouge (1994) and Bialy (White) (1994). We could use another like him.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

The use of light and shadow is spectacular, the music is divine, and the camera is constantly seeking and finding beauty in every shot.Looking at the postings so far it seems everyone has a different explanation, so I might as well throw mine into the mix.  To me Veronique/Weronika are twin angels being manipulated (guided might be a better choice of word) by God (or an abstract Divine) for some unfathomable purpose.  Consider the use of the puppeteer as a metaphor for the condition, look at how he says he makes two because they are fragile and break easily (just as Weronika breaks in her concert).  Veronique speaks of how she always knows what to do in every situation as if her life is leading up to something.  Theres a telling scene about midway through the film where Veronique walks between shadows through a slender path of light her face gazing rapturously at the the sun.  Both V's appreciate and reflect the beauty around them light, shadows, the falling rain, ... highly reminiscent to me of the 'fallen' angels in Wings of Desire.

At first I saw the same connections I thought the girls see; but later I interpreted events differently from how I think they do. I'll use a few scenes as examples.At her father's place W wakes in a fright with a vague sense that she's not alone in the world, as if some spirit visits her. Later when she sights V in the square, she seems to have an other-worldly experience, as if this other girl is connected to that spirit. I assumed the same connection; but on watching the movie again, I realized that I had barely noticed something obvious in that scene W is in imminent physical danger of being run over by vehicles and being knocked on the head or arrested by riot police, while V is physically safe and sound on her bus. To have an inner experience on seeing one's double is fine; but at the same time, the sight of her double being safe and sound should encourage W to want to protect her own body and to get out of the square. Instead W reacts in her usual private way, standing in almost a trance as behind her the riot police prepare to move. Run W, run!! As for that other spirit, it is W's way of experiencing and reacting to her chest pains, for which she never seeks medical treatment. But she carefully defends her inner life as she prepares for her concert and tries to avoid her boyfriend Antek. He seems to be of good character, but any love affair can stress the spirit.Beginning with her first scene as a young woman, V vaguely senses some sort of loss in her life. Later the parallel to the scene in the square happens in the hotel room. V vaguely tells the puppeteer Fabbri (F) that she's always sensed there was someone else, and she's always known what to do. When F asks V to tell everything about herself, she promptly empties the contents of her purse onto the bed, then smiles sweetly as he goes through them. When V sees the photo of W that has been in her purse for a long time, V seems quickly to connect the photo with that someone else who has always helped her know what to do, and to connect her sense of loss with the assumed death of that person. I assumed the same connections myself. But after watching again later I paid more attention to some aspects of this scene we can take the contents of her purse as her private inner self, what little she has of one, which she so willingly dumps onto the bed, and which F goes through in a mocking manner, for example, making her crystal ball disappear - much as in an earlier scene he drives off with the angel-spirit on the side of his van. V's private life is under stress as it always is with a lover, even one of good character, which F lacks. To grieve at the assumed death of someone is fine; but the sight of the photo of her double from inside her own purse should encourage V to look within and to take care of her private self. Instead she reacts in her usual material way, imagining a dead body somewhere, and allowing F to enter her with the sort of mechanical sex one sees in bad pornography. Dig in, V, dig in!! As for the loss V senses, it is her was of experiencing and reacting to the withering of her own private life as she glides superficially and mechanically through the motions of her social life. As for her always knowing what to do, it is due to her own keen attention to the outer world and its social conventions - attention that W clearly lacks, though she tries to be kind to people.(BTW some have supposed that F has mysterious insight into some connection between W and V; but he could base his novel on nothing more than what V does and tells him in the hotel room.)W flourishes spiritually while paying the obvious price for never getting medical help for her heart condition. V flourishes materially and socially, but in the end she seems purely mechanical in going through all the right motions she moves the puppet of herself while F controls her; she drives her car to dad's place; she operates its power window to reach to the tree; then she runs like a puppet to dad, who has been working wood with his new sophisticated tool. Each girl succeeds in her own way, but also pays a heavy price for being over-specialized.The many parallels between W and V serve as artistic device to compare and contrast them. But connections between W and V, other than each sighting the other briefly, are not required in this interpretation. For each of the girls that sighting is an awful tease, since she cannot realize how easily the other girl can deal with the current situation, in which she is so unaware and helpless herself. Here is a pair of stories the first is a slight revision that lets each girl survive, and the second brings them together. "},{"Title":"Superb!

The movies in his Polish/French trilogy, Blue, White, and Red, are finely tuned, sensitive, imaginative dramas that use mystery, music, psychology and visual fluidity to immerse you in another world that is beguiling and fascinating.That's exactly what goes on here. It's a stunning movie-making achievement in how it pulls off this unique blend of amorphous elements, leading you into the ambiguity of the director's invented world. And into the world (or worlds) of the lead characters, both played by Irene Jacob, a classic kind of restrained French (French-Swiss) actress with a limited range, but within that range she has penetrating beauty and a moving, melancholic aura for the camera, which lingers on her face through much of the movie. Her roles as the two women who are classic doppelgangers--they look alike, have similar talents (singing), and both have heart problems. And they overlap in reality for just a few seconds, with only one seeing the other until later, when the other finds she took a picture of the first.This is an unashamedly lofty film. It has high art written all over it, but not in the experimental or cutting edge way of independent filmmakers of this time. Rather, it pushes European mainstream film to its most refined limits, not giving up a narrative logic, not giving up musical scoring and photographic pyrotechnics, and not giving up a cast of beautiful people doing beautiful things. In fact, the star, first shown as a child, is looking at the stars in pure wonder, and the beauty of the world is sustaining and truly marvelous for her--and this I think is the life view of the director. That the world is amazing, filled with odd and beautiful coincidences, and is mostly there to be lived and enjoyed regardless.To some extent, he is both characters, both Veroniques. The allegories of 1980s Europe, splintering under Communism's last few years, have been written about a lot (the Polish Weronika gives herself to her music and dies for it, trapped somehow, the French Veronique is free to reject her talent, travel, and yet, ultimately, end up a puppet to her personal weakness). But the fact is, Kieslowski was both the successful Polish director who died young (though he didn't expect that I'm sure) for his art, and the successful expatriate living a life filled with art and pleasure. He embodied the modern Europe, filled with the heady optimism that led to the love of a new Europe without borders, infinite in its possibilities.It's worth noting that Communism has just fallen when this movie was made. There is a brief scene (the bus scene with the soldiers) that inserts this with, as usual, elegance. (Note here that he again makes the individual's inner needs more important than the greater politics.) The French Veronique is free to be hedonistic, the Polish version cannot quite do that, though you feel her struggle with what to do with her life as a singer.All of this is obviously impressive. For its intentions and its inner coherence, the movie is terrific. But it's also starting to feel self-important, a little overblown in both its allegories and even in the basic doppelganger hook that holds it together. It's also a slow movie. If you don't completely drown, happily, in the aesthetics of the film (which would be easy to do), you might find there are little moments made too important, too detailed, too unaware that the audience is getting ahead of the movie and is restless. For me this was in some of the musical segments, in the marionette scenes, and even in the very last moments, which should have blown me out of the water.Final word. I think it would help to see this film before the Three Colors trilogy, because they are better movies, especially Blue and Red. I have seen Red several times, and it also stars Jacob, and I love it completely still. This predecessor is thinner in comparison, but only in comparison to this remarkable director's startling successes immediately after.

Do we, perhaps even simultaneously, share the same thoughts, feel the same feelings, and take part in the same actions as another person we have never met? Is it more than instinctual for us to avoid certain things, or act in certain ways? This film spoke to these questions, but of course never answered them. It turns out, I believe, that there are no answers to begin with.This is the fourth Kieslowski film I've seen, and most certainly the best. Visually, it shares a few things in common with the Colors Trilogy, and Irène Jacob (Veronique and Veronika) was actually the main character in Red. Her acting is extremely good in both films, and the mood she creates in this one is understated, but incredibly graceful. I should mention the music in the film as well, which in addition to being beautifully presented, plays an important role in the connection between the two women. This is one of the best films ever made, presented by a man of great vision who left us far too soon.

Both women are played by the same actress, the radiant Iréne Jacob, winner of the Best Actress award at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. Born on the same day, they have green eyes and dark hair, congenital heart problems, and are talented singers, one a music teacher, the other a choir soprano, though each has a somewhat different personality. By its very nature, the story defies rational explanation and Kieslowski does not offer any, but the premise suggests that the separate self is an illusion, a projection of mind rather than an inherent expression of ultimate reality.Shot in Krakow, Poland and Paris, France, the film is suffused with the stunning cinematography of Slawomir Idziak and a sublime score by Zbigniew Preisner beginning with the song she sung by Weronica at her debut concert in Krakow. Weronica's story fills the movie's first thirty minutes. Weronica's exuberance and childlike innocence are captured in the film's early moments when, after an outdoor choir performance, she remains standing wide-eyed in the pouring rain, looking up at the sky, as the others run for shelter.Strangely though, Weronica tells others about an odd feeling that she is not alone, a feeling that is reinforced when she catches a glimpse of her doppelganger, Véronique, in the center of a Krakow square photographing a political protest demonstration (though she does not pursue her or mention the incident to family or friends). Though Weronica's desire to be a pianist was thwarted in an accident, her beautiful singing voice enables her to win a competition to join a musical company. As the young singer begins to perform her first concert, however, her heart condition sadly prevents her from continuing and the film shifts the remainder of its attention to Véronique.As we first see Véronique, she is in the middle of making love but suddenly bursts into tears without explanation, the incident occurring at the same moment when Weronika suffers serious heart problems at her concert in Krakow. Véronique has given up a promising singing career because she intuitively knows that it is wrong for her and instead becomes a music teacher of young children. During this same period she also schedules a cardiogram as if she has had some kind of warning. The film is propelled by the emotions Véronique is experiencing a strange feeling of being alone in a suddenly uncertain world and an unexplained sense of loss.The mystery deepens when she begins to receive enigmatic packages in the mail from Alexandre (Philippe Volter), a puppeteer whose exquisite marionette performance she has seen and whose gifts are tied to objects from his children's stories. Concluding from listening to a cassette tape that was recorded at the Saint Lazare train station, she meets Alexandre, but her expectations of love are thwarted by his mundane reasons for the subterfuge, although it serves to enhance her sense of closeness with Weronica.Though it is tempting to search for some sort of explanation, The Double Life of Veronique is better off not being analyzed but should be savored for its elusive and impenetrable poetry. If it has any point to make other than its captivating quality as a work of art, it may be that, in life, energy is wasted in trying to figure things out and that the only thing that makes sense is to submerge ourselves in its beauty and succumb to its mystery.

After a dramatic and significant event in weronika's life, the film turns to veronique for the final two acts, focusing primarily on her uniquely developing romantic relationship with a children's author.the double life of veronique is so rich and densely-woven that i found myself getting lost in all of the sensory and thematic layers. the cinematography is striking, with many memorable shots exhibiting a surreal and beautifully disorienting quality. the camera exposes a number of fascinating visual motifs as the film progresses - windows, reflections, and certain color associations, just to name a few. music plays a signficant role as well in the surreal connection between weronika and veronique. many musical cues throughout the film provide potential clues in unlocking the mystery of this film's meaning.and it is, most definitely, a mystery - at least it is to me after seeing the film only once. kieslowski is known for creating films that ask questions, rather than make statements and the double life of veronique is no exception. (in fact, it is perhaps the strongest example). he gives the viewer so much to process in this film and yet maintains almost complete ambiguity, leaving it open to any number of interpretations. as i continue to ponder and even revisit the film, i'm sure that my own interpretations will begin to take shape. in the meantime, i am haunted by its questions and anxious to sink back into the double life of veronique.

That this first time viewing actually comprises two viewings which are, though not back-to-back, only 3 days apart means yet a different experience. Finally, having gleaned a considerable amount of material before going into the cinema has perhaps changed significantly my perception from what it would have been had I first watched in back in 1991. Had I watched it back in 1991, without any foreknowledge of what the film is about, I would probably have made an immediate association to Hitchcock's classic Vertigo &#150; an abrupt death of the heroin leading to the mysterious resurrection of same. I would be looking for clues to explain the mystery and a satisfying twist at the end. And I could not have been more wrong.Armed with all the literature I've read, written from back in 1991 to quite recent times, by both professional critics and non-professional but almost equally erudite IMDb posters, I know what I would be looking for. There's only a thin line between the film being mysterious and poetic, and the words poetic and poetry appear in just about everything I read on this film. Poetic could mean technical thing like rhyme and rhythm, but here of course, it's senses and perceptions, as well as a frame of mind.The critics (back in 1991, mind you) talked about the frustration of trying to make some senses out of this film. But there are always two sides to a coin &#150; there is the joy and liberation of being able to see in the film anything you want. I do not see anything particular in Veronique's long red scarf dragged along the floor during her brisk walk along the corridor. But I am chilled right down my spine by the look and smile the alto gives to Weronika at the beginning of their duet. For some reason, I see death, but probably because of my foreknowledge. The images of the two old women seen moving slowly by Weronika and Veronique no one would fail to connect, but everyone would see different meanings from it. Each frame in this film contains details that are meticulously constructed by master Kieslowski, to provoke the audience's senses and intuitions, not to challenge their intellect. The entire film is shot in a sort of perpetual late afternoon glow which is close to sepia tone but a tad brighter. Images and motifs are so rich that it's hard to find another film that is comparable. Another poster has given a full discourse on the use of music. I would only mention the deepest impression I had, of a scene almost towards the end when Veronique wakes up from what looks like a short nap and moves through corridors and stairs to her lover the puppeteer's workroom. The loud, pulsating music invokes such a powerful sense of mystery that is almost oppressive. But when she finally gets into the workroom, looks at a puppet and asks with a most ordinary smile Is it me?, the music suddenly disappears, as if it was never there before. Cinematic magic! Enough praises have been heaped on Irene Jacob by everyone, or maybe never enough. She does particularly well in bringing out the subtle difference between the two women she portrays &#150; Weronika (cheerful, even playful, focused) and Veronique (more sensuous, melancholy, slightly bemused). This film is so rich that you can never say enough about it (and I have not even mentioned the puppet scene). I will certainly want to watch Double life again, on the big screen, maybe not so soon again as during the current screening but in some hopefully not-too-distant future re-screening.

The film tells the story of two identical-looking women, the Polish  Veronika and the French Veronique, who seem to be aware of each other in  some way, but who have never met.  The movie doesn't attempt to explain the  similarity of these characters; it is far more interested in telling their  stories and leaving the mystery as a sort of resonant background that  colors the events that unfold.  The radiantly beautiful Irene Jacob plays  the double role of the title characters, and she is brilliant; the film  doesn't give her very much dialog, but she communicates volumes with her  facial expressions and body language.  The cinematography is gorgeous, with  most of the film shot through amber-colored filters of one form or another,  essentially eliminating the color blue from the movie and giving everything  a slightly distant look.After seeing Kieslowski's three subsequent movies, his wonderful Three  Colors trilogy, it seemed to me that Veronique was almost intended to be  a prequel to them, with scenes in each movie alluding to scenes in the  others.

These are the clues we are given by Kieslowski in order to piece together Veronique's central mystery. It is, without question, a cinematic masterpiece, one of those rare, elliptical works of cinema that on first appearance seems to present two separate narratives unfolding in succession, with the director linking them through coincidence, chance and uncertainty. However, those familiar with Kieslowski and his work will know that this particular director would never make a film of such simplicity, and there is more information to be divulged as we wade through the murky puddles of the character's mind(s).The story begins in Poland, where we find the adolescent Veronika singing opera with her school choir. After getting caught in a rainstorm she goes home and makes love to her older boyfriend... so already we have themes of sex, music and the passage into womanhood, three very important factors that will resurface throughout the course of the film. Later in the story, Veronika gets the chance to audition for a highly prestigious opera company, but dies on stage before the audition is over. The story now moves to France where we meet Veronique - an older, though identical incarnation of Veronika - who works as a music teacher for an elementary school. It is at this point when most viewers begin to become baffled by the strange adjustment of the character, but in reality, no change has occurred. On the night of the audition, Veronika's death is a metaphorical one, and the sense of anxiety conjured by this important event causes her to faint away, thus losing the job.So, when we meet the same woman some time later she has remained in France and taken the job teaching music at the school. All other events surrounding the 'death' are symbolic and subjective of Veronika/Veronique's guilt and embarrassment (...note the point of view shot from within the grave and its roots in dream-logic). It is only after exploring the world as Veronique and seeking out surrogate father figures (or indeed, lovers) that the character is able to escape into one of her father's picturesque painting and find forgiveness from her family... or so it seems? This is merely one interpretation of the central events of the film, which, along with the later Three Colours Trilogy, demonstrates Kieslowski's interest in subjective realities layered upon various coincidental narrative view-points. From this, it is easy to see the director's attempt to fill his story with other stories that grow from the central narrative and either depict, or dictate, Veronique's state of mind.Here we have the themes of the opera, the performance of the marionettes, various confessional monologues, as well as the more conventional ideas of coming of age and growing sexual awareness, alongside the assorted political ideologies at work within the subtext. It's a particularly remarkable achievement in so much that the director takes us on a cerebral and emotional journey through one woman's psyche without any of us being fully aware of quite what is happening. As a result of this, the film works on multiple levels and, although it might be something of a cliché to point out (lest we forget that a cliché is full of truth... that's what makes it a cliché) but the film offers viewers the chance to interpret the images in situations however they desire, meaning that the overall film will have a different impact on everyone who views it, marking it out as a haunting dream of a film begging to be explored.This notion is further explored with the use of cinematography - which is spellbinding throughout - with the director and his esteemed cameraman Slavomir Idziak employing all manner of colour tints and strange optical filters (as they had done previously with A Short Film About Killing and would continue on their next project, Blue), to paint both Poland and Paris as strange, Gothic, ethereal dreamscapes that manage to convey the character's inner-emotions, as opposed to simply creating a mood. Of course, none of this would be possible without the stunning and intricate performance of Irene Jacob, who, unlike most actresses of her age, is able to exist naturally in two completely different worlds, whilst simultaneously presenting us with two very different characters.The fact that she is able to build such a subtle and invisible symbiosis between the two, whilst leaving the viewer completely oblivious to any broader sub-textual implications, is an astonishing achievement in itself. The Double Life of Veronique remains one of the defining works of European cinema in the 90's and is easily one of the greatest and most iconic films ever created by the late, great Kieslowski.

Strange consonances, mutual echoes of existences fastened to invisible threads that join together and keep apart. Subterranean feelings of overwhelming voids lived like sudden and unexpected moments of melancholy wrapped in mystery. Hands leaned against the bark of the trees in order to penetrate the arcane vibrations of the nature and to trace the broken thread that join us to a parallel existence swept away forever, whose fleeting trace can be seen on a creased sheet of sensitive paper. Kieslowski chooses the sweet and gentle Irene Jakob to play the main character of his first movie after the worldwide famous Dekalog. It's impossible to forget the scene where the protagonist lifts her eyes to the sky like a flower to the rain (please, Sting, excuse me you can) to receive the raindrops in her face with open arms and to feed on their tonic energy. The movie is imbued with a flavor of magic innocence and candor and painted in light tones, while the music composed by Zbigniew Preisner seems to burst forth from the bowels of the film substance. The director models all around the figure of the protagonist a world of the same consistence of the marzipan, the same gracefulness of harmonious notes levitating in the air, the same delicacy of a handful of romantic kisses given passionately. All things considered, « The double life of Véronique » looks like an inexhaustible hymn to the life and to the capacity of regeneration peculiar to our vital tissues after an indirect experience of death, thank to the discovery of the absolute love, impalpable like the atmosphere that surrounds the whole story, unlikely and ethereal at the same time, sublimed by strange relations referring to subtle Kieslowskian metaphors always on the look-out.

It hypnotizes in the first five minutes and doesn't let your attention go until the end. Not one minute is wasted, not one shot feels wrong. Every tiny detail about this movie feels just so perfect.This is essentially a story about metaphysical, almost supernatural traits and connections we share with people we may not even know. Weronika and Véronique (both brilliantly played by Irène Jacob) were born on the same day but in two different countries. Weronika is a bit more spiritual and impulsive, while Véronique is more down to earth. After W dies on her first musical performance, V (who's a music teacher) feels a turn in her mind and decides not to become a singer. This correlation is later brought up by a puppeteer V meets, who by extreme coincidence wants to write a book about two connected women who don't know each other, one who burned her hand on the stove as a kid and the other who reached for the stove but felt like not touching it.According to Kieslowski's interview, the movie is about how your actions affect other people's lives in the most abstract of ways. Of course, there's more to it, but that's the basic principle, and the movie takes the idea to the extreme, depicting W's life almost as a trial run for V's life. The theme of doubles is constantly repeated throughout the film, in the most obvious ways such as showing V or W's image reflected on mirrors, or linking it with the dolls the puppeteer makes, not just in the scene where he makes two puppets based on V (one of which he holds in his hand, the other of which he leaves laying on the table), but also through his marionette performance, which tells the story of a ballet dancer who breaks her leg and turns into an angel.The final scene of the film shows V arriving at her father's house and stopping at the gate, while her father is cutting some wood in his house. She touches the tree in front of the house, which makes him stop sawing and instead looks back. This scene, given that the bit of wood he's sawing came from the tree in his yard, once again implies the mysterious connection that we may share with other people, or, in this case, with natural elements in general. The puppet-related imagery, on the other hand, raises questions whether or not destiny is real, and if it is, how much freedom does it grant us?The cinematography by Slawomir Idziak is beautiful and makes this one of the most well-shot films I've ever seen (does anyone else think this movie's visual style, or at least parts of the plot line inspired Amélie?). The two domineering colors are green and red, which not only ties in with the Christmas theme the start of the film has going for it, but also matches V's and W's lives. Green and red are complementary colors, much as how V's life is complementary to W's.

La Double vie de Véronique teaches you to appreciate escaping the comfort zone of trusted logic, recognize its pitfalls and see a strange, maybe even absurd fantastic premise in an otherwise realistic picture as a chance to discover something that cannot be named. Sure, Kieslowski pictures are always a combination of beautiful images, evocative music and a strong cerebral component, but La double vie de Véronique is his most enigmatic, thought provoking work. Various threads are spun by writer and director which appeal to the viewer's imagination, so that they may be connected or respected just the way they are. Or perhaps seen as a whole in the eye of the beholder in front of the screen Two different lives, one face, strings attached or mere coincidence? Is there fate? Does the demiurge work as puppeteer or are our actions influencing others in a way we would never anticipate? There are no metaphors in my work, Kiesloswki once said. Sounds challenging?

It's mesmerizing and that's really something for me because i can't remember another film i've seen that i can use this word about or maybe just a couple and they are almost all by David Lynch. No, i don't compare this film to Lynch's but they have something in common. They all look like dreams.La Double vie De Veronique is really like a dream to me. It looks like a dream, it features one of my dream girls, the story is not so important at all, just like in a dream, and it also features so many metaphors along the way. The whole film is as if taken from Kislowski subconsciousness and put on celluloid. Of course there's also a motif about duality, fatherhood but what struck you first is the overall atmosphere. The cinematography is excellent, here i go, i started with it, forgive me Irene. That's what makes the film so mesmerizing and really succumbs you in it. While i was watching, i really felt i wanted to be there, to live in this world, so melancholic and magical. And i also would like to be there because of Her.OK, i admit i've only seen two of her movies but that was enough. Irene Jacob is the greatest. I can't imagine how it is possible that she fell into mediocrity, or at least i heard so. But you know, i'm not that surprised either. She's not for everyone's taste. And of course i mean her acting abilities too. I heard some users think of her as just a pretty face. Actually i don't think that's bad. Good film actors have to have charisma, a magnetic quality that attracts you in them so that you feel concerned and involved, i would love too see Glenn Close from the back rolls of the theater but not in a erotic thriller. And about the acting abilities - people see Al Pacino shouting at people and think that that's what is all about but it's not. Not all the people in the real world are so aggressive, passionate or so extrovert. Irene Jacob's acting is really very sublime and that's really hard. It's just that her heroine is that kind of person. I would really like to see more of her movies and to see her in new movies too. If not else she remains one of my favorites.And here comes the music. It's beautiful and it's really in the right mood with the film. I was even thinking at one point what if the film was based on the score and not the other way around. Gospodin Preiner is the man responsible. Well done is the least i can say. I'm trying really hard to find the music of the film. The scene with the concert and the subsequent death of Weronika is just so heartbreaking. By the way i like her better than Veronique. Yes, there is differences but you've got to find them by yourself. Or maybe just because she's a bratushka(a Slav).

She was born on the same day as Weronika and is her double. In fact, she felt a pain at the moment that Weronika died.The Double Life is a beautiful looking film, not just because of Irene Jacob's perfect breasts.

The lighting is invariably beautiful, shot in sepia tones which mirror Tarkovsky.  Of greatest interest, though, is its influence on 'Amelie'.  The theme of a young girl drawn inexorably towards her destined lover, achieved through a series of bizarre, improbably (indeed, supernatural) events is present in both and there are similarities in appearance and personality between Irene Jacob here and Audrey Tautou in Amelie.Maybe this is far-fetched, but I also detected what might be a precursor to Spike Jonze's films (scripted by Charlie Kaufman).  'Being John Malkovich', along with 'The Double Life..' carries puppetry as a central analagous idea, both films featuring puppets of the main characters.  Also, the notion of one of the main characters writing the story of the film within the film (which we see in 'the Double Life...') is obviously the central premise of 'Adaptation'.'The Double Life of Veronique' is therefore definitely worth a look considering that 'Amelie', 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' all seem to borrow heavily from it.

The doubling of a person begs the question of identity, the definition of self If there's two copies of a person, what distinguishes one from the other, what makes one unique? And once the question of identity and self is raised, the question of soul is not far behind Given two identical bodies, twins, then isn't the immutable constant that makes each person unique independent of their physical existence, doesn't selfhood, the individuation of consciousness, spring from the soul? That's the theme, the structure of this movie. Yet, even though Kieslowski asks metaphysical questions, he is not a philosopher. He is not, frankly, an intellectual. He is a highly skilled manipulator of film image, capable of no more than loose haphazard narrative, dependent of the laxity and forgiveness of artistic association, metaphor, and symbol. So even though the question is begged, it is not plumbed to any great depth. Rather, it is seductively skimmed, skirted, teased at. Soul in this movie is nothing more than a silly reflected light bouncing around a room without an apparent source. A beautiful actress, Irène Jacob, with luminous eyes and swollen lips is not enough. Stripped of the seductive beauty and mystery of movie image, its compelling recreation of time present, his magic realism is in the end simplistic, a slight of hand, a ruse.Kieslowski's movies are soft, lush, clever, threaded through with leitmotivs and conjuring, but in the end, empty. You go home with a vapor, no more.

Irène Jacob's immeasurably understated grace and beauty permeate this film, from the first moments in Krakow where she elevates her voice to angelic proportions, to the second half where she tries to connect with herself in another way.Quickly put, we see two aspects of the same life and experience. Weronika in Poland, a radiant singer with little training but an apparent divine gift, enjoying life with full vigour and finally reaching the dream of become a stage presence, only to be seized from our world by the maker above. It seems unjust, but perhaps she had an inkling of trouble when she spotted her double on a bus slightly before, a jarring experience that nonetheless made her keep her focus.On the other side, in France, we find Véronique, who suddenly abandons singing to teach music to children. She finds herself intrigued by a puppeteer who strikes a cord within her with his marionette show, and slowly comes the realization that she is half of a now incomplete whole.Kieslowsky's brilliance shines in this movie. As we'll see later in his seminal Three Colors, he uses closeups of mundane items to represent stages of reflection or worry. In Bleu it is a sugar cube dissolving in Julie's coffee while here we see a teabag immersing itself, emptying its flavour in hot water and thus ridding itself of its duties. Kryztof also perfectly captures Poland in revolutionary moments and the imperilled safety of one individual.Weronika goes from the ecstasy of singing to that of physical ardour to apotheosis whilst her French counterpart regresses from singing to teaching to fleeing to finding, and finally understanding. Jacob is near perfect here, hitting all the right emotive notes. Her almost radiant happiness as she sings hymns at the start, during a torrential downpour, is an unforgettable moment. Her grief at finding herself in the final scenes is also palpable, a bravura performance for the actress.A fine film, deep in starting blocks for other movies from this director, The Double Life of Véronique is a must for anyone who has led more than one life or feels connected to others.

Maybe I'll watch that some time soon, but not right after watching this film. I could go looking for some easy answers - if there are any, which I doubt anyway - but I'd rather stay for now in a moment where I can just ponder everything I watched. It's such a rich and moving experience, and is one of the most unique mystery films I've seen in a very long time - possibly ever.In a way its chief mystery is what it's all about, which remains, possibly, elusive even to the end. Of course we have an idea of the concrete fact that there were two babies born on the same day in different countries, France and Poland, and they grew up to be beautiful young women with dark hair and brown eyes, and looked exactly the same. There's also a moment where the two see each other (one sees the other on a tour bus in Krakow, this in the midst of a protest/riot in the streets, and yet this other woman on the bus won't see her, at least not yet). Will they try to look for one another is a key question.But Kieslowski is so not interested in anything conventional here. The mystery is about discovering things, but not necessarily the deeper mystery of one knowing for sure the other exists; in other words, this isn't one of those double movies like, say, The Double (2014). We really get two stories here of these women, and they're full-on character portraits the first half hour is dedicated to Weronique, the Polish woman, who is a professional singer (and former piano player) who has a heart condition. The rest of the film focuses on Veronique, who is a music teacher and, after seeing a puppet show performed by a charismatic man named Antoine (or is it Alexandre, one of those), he starts to... stalk her? Follow her in an intriguing way? Certainly he leaves clues for her to find, and when she does... then what? I'd like to make note for a moment music in the film. I don't think it's some flippant artsy choice on the filmmaker's part that each of these people are involved with music. Music is so central to the film, especially when Weronique is singing and becomes her most vulnerable, but also in those moments (on the flip-side image, so to speak) where Veronique isn't paying as close attention to the music she's teaching her students. Notice the opera that Weronique sings comes back more than once, like when Veronique is watching the marionette show. There is significance there, and it may be rooted back into that realm that music can lie with every person - like romance, which this film has, you can't always use the utmost logic ('the heart wants what it wants' so to speak) so why a music moves one person won't necessarily be the same for another. Why is music so paramount for Weronique, while for Veronique it doesn't seem so? Or, is music one of the things that connects them in that elusive, deep-deep down inside sense that they both have? Or maybe they're latent Jedis or something (I kid).How this is all filmed is completely absorbing; Kieslowski uses hand-held camera-work, but in a steady way that often creates tension, like when the two Veroniques are walking out in public (i.e., French side after she leaves her rendezvous with this not-so-mystery man and tries to go through crowded streets, and the Polish side after a rehearsal, where her heart becomes weak and she stumbles to catch her breath). How he uses color is especially breathtaking as well, and not always in ways that forces it but suggests things - red filters and bright whites and yellows here and there (not as blatant as the Colors trilogy, but maybe this was a practice round). So even when things get so enigmatic that it could, in just a few moments, become pretentious, Kieslowski reels it back in and makes the direction vital and important in ways that are unexpected. The camera itself is often another character, which is impressive.I've come all this way and haven't noted that without Irene Jacob this might all not work, or at least as well. There may be a moment here and there where it doesn't seem like she's doing much - she's so beautiful (on the cover I thought for a moment it was Ingrid Bergman with her eyes closed) that one might underestimate how deep and powerful she gets into both these women. The vulnerability is what's so staggering, and how much she feels the moments of joy and wonder, how her face registers genuine curiosity and in seeking out this mystery, and that crucial scene at the café when this Frenchman is revealed, notice how her face changes - it's subtle, but it's really there. I could watch Irene Jacob in this film or Red and see an actress so in tune with the character(s) that she in a way does half the work for Kieslowski. In other words, even when I was wondering, more than once, 'this storyline, such as it is, is getting a little weird and quixotic, maybe for its own good', she really grounded me in the emotional logic, and the pathos becomes so much that it makes something like a scene near the end this mix of heartbreak and bewilderment that I've rarely seen like this in a film.It's at times confounding, in certain choices and moments, but never in ways that might alienate; Kieslowski asks the audience 'come, a little closer - find out more about these women, and whatever the outcome, the journey is genuine and interesting.'

A famous example of this is Mullholland Drive - nobody has ever really been able to give a straight forward solution as to what the film is about, but it's still a very affecting piece of work, and the main comparison I had in my head while watching this film.This is a completely different movie, though, and what it achieves is much more impressive in my eyes. The plot couldn't be a whole load simpler; two women, identical in looks, age, and name, lead parallel lives - one in France, one in Poland. One day, one of our heroines catches a glimpse of the other by chance, seemingly setting in motion a chain of events I won't describe, lest I spoil it for everyone. Needless to say, it's an outlandish plot, but Kielowski wisely doesn't question this.Instead of focusing on its plot, it instead focuses on nailing down the eerie atmosphere that permeates nearly every scene - a strategy that absolutely pays off. Very few films out of the horror genre manage to capture such an atmosphere and it's staggeringly impressive, thanks in no small part Iréne Jacob - an actress who by now is slightly forgotten, but has given performances that would be career-best for many Hollywood stars. This is definitely one of them, capturing a wide-eyed innocence and strength that few actresses ever manage.A lot of thought is given to what this film means. It's a fair question, but as I mulled it over in my head afterwards, I realized it's not really the point. The film itself is the one searching for the meaning, and while it has no answers, its questions are much more engaging. My interpretation is that Kielowski is asking whether or not we aren't actually as alone as we like to think we are sometimes - that there are forces, far beyond our comprehension, pulling strings and making things happen. Almost everything that happens in this film appears distorted or magnified somewhere else in its running time - repeated, endlessly, forming patterns. It's not going to suit every taste, but it's a fascinating look at a take on life that most wouldn't have thought of.

The Double Life of Veronique is a haunting musical epiphany and with such visual poetry, it is filled with symbolism, some frank eroticism, and a slight dark humor. Kieslowski loves to filter colors to have an effect on his films, if it was part of his Three Colors Trilogy, it would've been Gold. The photography was nostalgic, the lighting gives different shades on different moods of the characters. Irene Jacobs was enigmatic and sensual in her role as Weronika and Veronique. The story is simple, but there is more than the plot here, Kieslowski is more concerned in the visual rhyme, and his mystical narration of the story. He kind of connect the whole film together with strings but still leaves it like a scattered puzzle, it encourages uncertainty, and that is what I really liked about it. It leaves us with haunting questions that remains for us to answer, maybe in our own lives, rather than making us a complacent viewer that understands everything about the film and the world.

Another reason was the fact that this was his first collaboration with Irène Jacob who later appeared in his masterpiece Three Colors Red. So yeah i wanted to see their first collaboration. My expectations i would say were not big, because i had heard that many people did not get the movie, but i hoped for the best.The Double Life of Veronique is directed and written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and it stars Irène Jacob, Wladyslaw Kowalski and Halina Gryglaszewska. And i got to say that my biggest fear has come true, because i cant understand not in a whole what this movie is about. The movie follows two identical Veroniques, born on the same day - one Polish, one French, both with an identical heart condition and the same great operatic singing voice,both look like each other, they are like separated twins.We never really truly understand the connection between the two Veronique's they both look the same, the same thing is happening to both, and they feel something that they cant describe, they never feel alone, they always in a way feel each other.Its weird because i cant say that i disliked the movie, and i don't understand much of what happens, at times i felt like i was under a spell, very weird felling, some scenes are almost hypnotizing. Because of Kieslowski visual beauty, the yellows and oranges on screen perfect, but also because of Irène Jacob, she is amazing. The luminous Irène Jacob does wonders with her difficult double role as Veronika/Véronique, which requires her presence in nearly every frame of film. Guided by the sure hand of Kieslowski, Jacob projects an authentic goodness and innocence, coupled with a palpable sensuality and sensitivity. And this seems effortless. And to think that Andie MacDowell was almost cast to be in the movie, No way she would had been as great as Irène.While watching it i was amazed by the visual beauty that once again Kieslowski managed to put on screen, by the charming star that Irène Jacob is on screen, but after the movie ended, the movie left me with questions lots of them, it left me confused.I think Kieslowski wanted us to end the puzzle by ourselves the thing is that he doesn't give enough pieces, maybe the puzzle just cant be done, and in film i like to finish my puzzle.

While Weronika is cheerful, focused and ethereal, Véronique is a more practical, sensuous individual who is easily influenced and manipulated by the people that surround her. Seeing these differences is crucial to have a better understanding of how the actions they take affect the course of their lives and how Véronique feels about herself by the end of the film.

It tells the story about and educated singer and pianist named Weronika who lives in an apartment in Poland and who is in a relationship with a man named Antek. After experiencing a feeling of not being alone which she is instigated to act upon, Weronika travels to Krakow where her aunt lives and when she gets there she notices a woman whom she has never seen before and who bears a striking resemblance to herself.Distinctly and subtly directed by Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, this finely tuned fictional tale which is narrated mostly from the two main character's point of view, draws a virtuous portrayal of the life of a Polish woman named Weronika and a French woman named Veroniqué who are identical and who one day coincidentally or determined by destiny crosses paths. While notable for it's naturalistic and atmospheric milieu depictions, distinct production design by production designer Patrice Mercier, cinematography by polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, costume design by costume designers Laurence Brignon, Claudy Fellous and Elzbieta Radke, fine editing by French film editor Jacques Witta and use of colors and light, this character-driven and narrative-driven story where the director could focus more on the cinematic aspects of his film and less on the political which was characteristic in many of his previous productions due to the political situation in his country, depicts two interrelated and empathic studies of character and contains a great score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner.This dramatic, literary, somewhat surreal, romantic and humanistic drama from the early 1990s about identity and faith which is the last feature film Krzysztof Kieslowski made before ending his career with the Three Colours trilogy which consisted of Blue (1993), White (1994) and Red (1994) and which is set in the capital city of France and the capital city of Poland in the early 1990s and where a music teacher for children named Veroniqué who lives in France experiences a feeling of being alone, is impelled and reinforced by it's brilliant narrative structure, substantial character development, subtle continuity, interrelated stories, endearing characters, poetic scenes and the memorable acting performance by French actress Irène Jacob. A cinematic, cinematographic, psychological and lyrical mystery which gained, among numerous other awards, the FIPRESCI Prize Krzysztof Kieslowski, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury and the award for Best Actress Irène Jacob at the 44th Cannes Film Festival in 1991.

She is always breathless because of a heart defect that she is unaware of. She is searching for love. Veronique lives in France. She lost her mother as a kid. She has a gift for music, and she teaches it to young children. She likes to apply a golden ring around her eye. She runs a lot. She is always breathless because of a heart defect that has just been found out. She is searching for love. Weronika sees Véronique in Krakow, the city she lives in. She stops in the middle of a place crowded with people demonstrating and riot squads. Her alter ego is getting on a bus which will take her back to France. Before the bus leaves, Véronique has time to take pictures of the place and of Weronika, but she does not see her. During the first half-hour of the film, the subjective shots which represent Weronika's vision are unsteady, the fisheye angle twists the perspectives, until Weronika herself collapses, on the stage, among the music instruments and in front of the audience, in the middle of a song. After Weronika's death, we follow Véronique. She is making love with a man, and, right after it, she feels an immense sadness. She says to her lover « It's as if I were grieving » but she is unable to explain why. She decides to give up on the concert she was preparing, the same concert, we can imagine, during which Weronika died. Véronique follows her intuition, and Weronika's death prevents her from dying herself. In the school where Véronique teaches, a man manipulates puppets for the children. He makes the puppet die and become a sort of angel. Later on, Vétonique receives an anonymous phone call, then she gets a lace in the mail, and then an audio tape thanks to which she finds the place from where the anonymous man sends his objects to her. She finds him in a bar in the Gare Saint Lazare in Paris. She recognizes the puppeteer. In a hotel, after they have made love, and confessed their love, she empties her purse on the bed because he wants to know her better. He looks at the photos she took during her trip in Eastern Europe. He says that she is pretty on the pictures. She notices Weronika for the first time. She starts to cry. Weeks, maybe months later, she wakes up in the middle of the night and finds her lover making a second puppet of herself. She asks why he made two puppets of her, and he says that it is because they get damaged. She manipulates one puppet, while the other is lying motionless. The puppeteer reads to her the first version of a tale he is writing about two women on two different continents who are in fact two versions of the same person. This focus on the puppets reminded me of an essay written by Furio Jesi on Rilke's poetry. Jesi writes the doll, in its form, tragically announces to men that it is her, not them, who will survive in the Infinite. ». To me, the puppets are a reminder of the fate that awaits Véronique as well, that is death. The two women will disappear in death but the two puppets will remain. There is a very important dreamlike dimension in the film which features a dwarf who is also a lawyer, an old exhibitionnist, conversations of secondary characters with no beginning and no end, a subjective shot of the dead Weronika being buried. The film is also very poetic. I think of two shots in particular the two versions of the old lady crossing the screen, and the image of the old church reflected backwards in a plastic ball. To appreciate this film, you need to get rid of the need to understand and analyze everything, and accept the absurd side of reality. My sister saw the film with me, and at one point she said « there is something in this film that is us. » That « something » can be defined as the atmosphere, the setting, the green and red colors. the light. Kieslowski's movie addresses that part of our brain that is the center of our emotions, of our sensations, and of the memories of those sensations. It remains with us like an old dream that we had forgotten.

Both women are played by the stunningly beautiful and captivating Irène Jacob. Weronika gets her story told in the first third and then Véronique has her turn. In addition to their being identical in physical appearance the two women share many other traits. Both are musically talented, have similar heart conditions, are the same age, and have parallel experiences. While the two never meet, they intuit the existence of each other in some mysterious ways. This storyline may be hard to swallow for the literal minded, but the movie is not out to convince us of anything, but rather to create a mood and have us consider possibilities. I think most people have wondered who on the earth most resembles them in appearance and experience and this film taps into that speculation by way of exaggeration. And who knows, is what happens in this movie any stranger than the existence of entangled particles at the atomic scale where a change in the state of one effects a change in the other no matter the distance separating them?Much is left to the interpretation of the viewer and anyone who is looking for some definite meaning will most likely be disappointed. Many scenes and events seem to be of little relevance. For example, when Weronika is having an acute heart problem she looks up and sees a man in an overcoat walk by and expose himself. These ridiculous events certainly happen in everyday life, but why put this in here? There is a stern, scowling woman who appears in both stories, but there is no hint given as to her tie-in.This is artfully filmed and could be considered a warm-up for Kieslowski's Three Colors Red, since many scenes are lighted in soft red light and many physical objects are red. The lighting takes full advantage of Ms. Jacob's beauty. Given the musical talents of the two women, it is not surprising that music plays a key role in the film. There is a concert scene that has Weronika singing an incredibly magnificent aria. I played that scene several times. The soundtrack composed by Zbigniew Preisner lends a haunting quality to the proceedings and much would be lost without it. In a playful twist, music from an 18th-century Dutch composer, Van den Budenmayer, is referenced and played. Turns out that this is a pure creation of Preisner.The Criterion Collection DVD has an alternate ending for the U. S. version. Any additional significance contained therein was lost on me.When I first watched this I did not much appreciate it. Thinking that maybe I had missed something I watched it again and was glad that I did, since I found it much more engaging. Perhaps I was too busy reading subtitles on first viewing and missed the exceptional visual qualities.

The filming itself was great, beautiful shots of Krakow and Paris along with great camera angles and movement (such must be exceptional for me to even notice!). The heroine is stunningly beautiful and I confess the mere fact that I couldn't take my eyes off of her by itself causes me to give TDLOV a thumbs up. Whether you see, find, etc., a plot, suspense is present, whether for its own sake or not! The introduction of interesting characters is intriguing, even if at least some of them clearly go nowhere. Likewise odd incidents (the flasher!) arouse curiosity if -again- the itch created is never scratched. If SOME theme must be underscored this viewer was/is content with the notion of life's sensation of meaning; i.e., whether meaning is truly present or not. "},{"Title":"Spiritual Bonds and Pure Emotions","Date":"14 August 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Music","Review":" Krzysztof Kieslowski's Polish films weren't exactly social descriptions but the Polish reality exhaled from them. After he had made The Decalogue and The Short Films About Killing and Love, he made his first international film La Double vie de Veronique which was followed by The Three Colours film trilogy. Already in No End (1985) Kieslowski worked with the screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz and the composer Zbigniew Preisner, with whom he made all of his subsequent films. In result of this masterful trio all the international films by Kieslowski are characterized by aesthetic styling. Compared to his Polish features they were also more ethereal, absurd and almost fantasy-like. In them, women rose out from the kitchen to Kieslowski's protagonists, and therefore he reached completely new emotional scales. The Double Life of Veronique tells the story of two young women, Polish Weronika and French Veronique who unconsciously share a spiritual bond.Weronika is a very talented singer, but she has a weak heart. She has to choose between artistic and normal life, because singing might have tragical consequences for her heart. When she wins a singing contest and the judges give her a chance to perform, she gets a heart attack in the middle of the concert and dies. The French Veronique is the double of Weronika and she also has a breathtakingly beautiful voice and a weak heart. Without knowing it Veronique shares a spiritual bond with Weronika, when Weronika dies she suddenly starts to feel vacant and blue. To avoid the pain she decides to give up art and starts to teach music in a school. One day a man, Alexandre who writes books for children and makes puppet show performances, arrives to the school. Veronique is immediately enchanted by him. A few days after Veronique starts to receive mysterious clues from Alexandre, an empty cigar box, shoe lace and a tape. The tape leads her to a railway station where Alexandre is waiting for her. They go to a hotel room and have sex, after that Alexandre finds a picture that Veronique has taken in Poland and sees Weronika in it. He of course thinks that it's just Veronique in the picture, but when Veronique herself sees the picture she begins to being aware of her double. Alexandre, who badly wants to be a real author wants selfishly to steal the double life of Veronique for his book. In result of this Veronique leaves, knowing that Alexandre is not the man she is looking for.In his interview book, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, he tells that he is always searching for the balance between understanding and mystery. Because if he shows too much the mystery disappears, and if he doesn't show enough -- no one understands a thing. But this is exactly the beauty in Kieslowski's films and in order to attain the new emotional scales of his international production, he had to preserve the mystery. In the end where Veronique realizes Alexandre isn't the right man for her, she leaves from there to her father's house. Kieslowski said that almost no one in the United States understood the ending -- by his producer's request he made an alternate ending for the States. They didn't understand where Veronique went, or if they did, they didn't know why. Kieslowski explained it through examples in his interview book that it is hard for Americans to realize the meaning of home. In European culture the family structure is much more stronger. Veronique touches the old tree seeking for comfort, care and safety.Just as Kieslowski's Blue, The Double Life of Veronique is also about music. Blue is about composing and Veronique is about singing. Zbigniew Preisner's masterful score is so beautiful that the audience could burst out into tears just in result of that. But, in addition, Idziak offers us some breathtakingly beautiful images with the help of the touching story by Piesiewicz, told us by the master of visual narrative, Krzysztof Kieslowski. The Double Life of Veronique deals with sensitivity, sensations and relations. It is a film about emotions. Loneliness, love and passion. It is about the relation between the spirit and the body. It's about eroticism, art, life and death.Many film fanatics see Jean Vigo's L'Atalante (1934) as the most beautiful film ever made and I couldn't agree more, but if talking about the new cinema (post-1970's) I can say without a doubt that The Double Life of Veronique is the most beautiful film. But what makes it so beautiful? Of course the cooperation of Kieslowski, Pisiewicz, Idziak and Preisner, but also the multidimensionality of it. The harsh Polish reality can be seen beneath the surface and, the story Kieslowski creates with Piesiewicz is breathtaking. It is so real and close to ourselves. The Double Life of Veronique is about our deepest emotions it overflows with Pure Emotions.

The film has been rhapsodized by international film critics as Kieslowski's 'coming out' film, but one can see it is clearly a bridge between the direction he was headed with his TV series The Decalogue, and where he ended up in the Trilogy.The film is not linear, which is the first thing that separates it from the typical Hollywood, and even contemporary European, films, but there is a cloying coyness to the film's reliance on synchronicities and contrivances that is more pronounced than in the Trilogy, where the errors Kieslowski made here were modulated. A film, or any work of art, that has a number of interpretations is exciting, but one with unlimited interpretations is a cheat, and reeks of narrative laziness. The Double Life Of Véronique falls just short of going too far, but the relentless scenes of cogitation for the sake of cogitation- and revealing lead actress Irène Jacob's lovely face and body, border on the obsessive; which would not be a bad thing, considering a good portion of the film's tale is on that topic, but the plain fact is that there is nothing new brought to the table on said topic.Many critics have read so much nonsense into the film- such as the early death of Weronika absurdly representing Poland's absorption into the Soviet Bloc- in this most apolitical of films, that such readings only highlight the film's greatest failure- a lack of coherence. Yes, the film has to be given some latitude, narratively, but open endedness, to a fault, is still a fault. That Kiesloski did not repeat this in his later films is a recognition of this fact, and may explain his near obsessive need for tying up the ends of the Three Colors Trilogy in Red. Such things as how Alexandre got Weronika's possessions? Could he be the lover that Weronika was leaving Antek for? After all, he's famous and travels. Thus his later obsession with her twin, when he meets her, would have psychological resonance, as well as explain his stalking and sending of things. One can resist the temptation to figure out every last detail in a film like this, for much does not stand up to intellectual scrutiny, but to not ground the narrative in some bit of internal diegetic reality is to rob the film of its solid foundation.The Double Life Of Véronique ultimately misses greatness, if by a hair, because of these flaws- such as its too contrived, and lacking in chemistry, romance, for it often tries to force its implausible mystery at the viewer, rather than letting it evolve more subtly. In this way, its directed ending- even if more mysterious, is actually more in line with the Pulp Fiction sort of storytelling than that in the Three Colors Trilogy, which might explain why The Double Life Of Véronique was highly awarded, whereas Red lost out to Quentin Tarantino's convoluted yet plot driven film at that year's Cannes Film Festival. The ending, where Alexandre tells Véronique of his plan for a book similar to the film is simply too much, and such preciousness is a flaw in the screenplay by Kieslowski and Piesiewicz. One wonders what a greater screenwriter, like Bergman, could have done with these ideas. He certainly would have muted some of the obviousness, for even in Persona- another overrated, but greater, film, he does not go so far as to have the two aspects of what could be one person/persona played by a single actress. Thus, the film relies more on its strengths- which are undoubtedly great the acting of the sensual yet innocent Jacob, and the evocative imagery, where the narrative's oneiric progression works best in its hermetic cosmos, crafting the dialogue of the two women from silence, even as the camera fixates on the radiant Jacob.I wonder if Kieslowski was aware of the scientific studies done on twins separated at birth, and if this fact influenced this film, even to the point that the two women were, indeed, twins- one adopted by a Polish family, and the other by a French family? Such a hint that this might be the case could be evinced through further watchings, which I shall engage in, and which might just raise this slyly intriguing cocktease of a film above the bar for greatness. Until that time, however, I am left with the critical truism that while the narrative interior of a film can get away with not being analyzed too closely, the same cannot always be said for its exterior workings. This is why the film left me with a lack, yet why I also will view it again. Sometimes success and failure can have the same result. Other times not. Just ask Weronika/Véronique.

A slight brush of the flapping of the soul's invisible wings; a glance at the spirit's fine and delicate contours; a peek at its mystical, miraculous and metaphysical silhouette. Sublime cinema! The Double Life Of Véronique is the creative pinnacle of Kieslowski's otherwise extraordinary rich career. This majestic film is a festive celebration of the wizardry of unrestrained, ingenious film-making, a showcase for singular quality of cinema as a collaborative art form. The film's steady, always radiant yet subtle energy, is a magic flow of transcendental forces, a wide river which makes artificial boundaries between two countries, Poland and France - between Weronica and Véronique - irrelevant and obsolete. Véronique opens with an exterior shot of a Polish choir girl; her gaze lifted towards heavens, her angelic voice soaring as the spring downpour disperses the rest of the choir girls. A living angel singing an ode to the creator, a gifted girl celebrating the majesty of living. That's what artists are put on Earth to do - aspire to heavens. La Double Vie De Véronique is a reflection of Kieslowskie's deep artistic longings, a mirror reflecting his most intimate film aspirations. The film was made during the crucial time in his life, the time of revolutionary upheaval - the lifting of the iron curtain; the time, also, of his moving to France from his native Poland. The character of Polish Weronika and her mirror image, French Véronique, are composites of the artist's soul, the embodiment of his artistic strivings. Supremely gifted with angelic soprano, Weronika is the artist's Polish alter ego. Her heart condition is a poetic metaphor of the fractured soul of an artist behind the iron curtain witnessing the collapse of the old world. Weronika's final demise is symbolic of the passing of an era and Kieslowski's eventual leaving his native Poland. There has always been a dynamic duality within hearts and souls of eastern European artists. Constrained by the rigor and dogma of the totalitarian ideology, the artist's domestic roots and artistic inspirations were in constant conflict with the longing for the western freedom of expression and unrestrained creativity.Véronique, a music teacher, is Weronika's body-double and, symbolically, Kieslowski's French incarnation. She is introduced in an erotic scene that surprisingly leaves the French copy of Polish Weronika saddened and melancholic. As the film moves from Poland-set first act to modern day Paris, we find Véronique feeling a strange sense of loss, a vague sensation that a part of her had mysteriously disappeared. In an early scene in Poland, Weronika takes a note of a passing truck hauling an upright statue of Lenin. It is the time of turmoil, the time of sweeping, historic changes taking place.The old Poland of the Kieslowskie's young, formative years is swept away by the course of history - forever gone. A heartfelt loss that an immigrant artist in a foreign country feels deeper than any other human being. Véronique's heart condition is symbolic of an uprooted artist's heartache - the pain for the things which a person leaving his country irrevocably looses. Véronique's search for the identity and whereabouts of her secret admirer through the maze of urbane Paris, is a primal quest mirroring Kieslowskie's own search for artistic identity and recognition in the new, unknown, more challenging foreign terrain. The original soundtrack composed by master composer Zbigniew Prieznev compliments every aspect of the film to an extent that its haunting score becomes an integrated narrative element and its melodies turn into magical strings connecting the two women.Genre-defying, as many European movies are, the films effortlessly crosses various cinematic terrains. This is a genuine masterpiece that will forever remain the finest achievement of the late 20th century European cinema. On another level altogether, this majestic metaphysical thriller could be viewed as the first cinematic acknowledgment of the validity of the string theory of the universe. "}{"Title":"Split Individuality","Date":"1 June 2007","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Music","Review":" La double vie de Véronique by Krzysztof Kiewlowski shows in a most remarkable way how a person can be split in two individuals &#150; Weronica who lives in Poland and Véronique who lives in France. According to classical Aristotelian logic, however, an individual is bound by place, time and body. Nobody can show up in the same body in two different places and/or at two different times, but a look at several mythologies shows that this concept of individuality is nothing but our heritage from ancient Greek thinking. Logic and metaphysics that form the fundamental of our sciences but also of our daily perception are Aristotelian as well. According to Celtic logic, for example, a two- or tripartite individual causes no problems at all, since here the spatial and temporal axes do not go into the definition of the individual.In order to treat multi-partite individuality, it is thus necessary to abandon Aristotelian logic. Since Celtic mythology (as mythology in general) cannot be formalized like Aristotelian logic, one must understand that time- and space-bounding of individuality in classical thinking causes mono-contexturality, i.e. an abyss between two persons as big as the abyss between the Here and the Beyond. On the other side, a poly-contextural notion of individuality allows the exchange between individuals. Already in a three-valued poly-contextural logic, the question arises if Death means the loss of individuality as it does in a two-valued mono-contextural logic. It seems to be merely a decrease of matter, but not of mind. So, when Weronica dies in Poland, she is able to survive as Véronique in Paris. It is remarkable that this kind of doppelganger shown in Kieslowski's movie does not belong to the frightening ones. In the opposite, since our perception of this world is not a two-valued light-switch system but colorful, so also the logic on which our perception is based should not be a yes-no logic but allow more values outside of this mono-contextural dichotomy.While only very few people accept that two-valued logic is long outdated &#150; although already Heisenberg's detection that subject and object cannot be differentiated anymore on the level of high energy physics proves that this logic is fragmentary -, it is amazing that poly-contextural moments show up so often in movies. Very seldom, however, this has been presented in such an intriguing manner as in La double vie de Véronique. Since science fiction in literature has announced the various developments of computer technology such as robots or cyber space, it is possible that up to now still fictional elements of our thinking are now announced by film that precedes the future change in our perception and its logical and metaphysical bases to which belongs without doubt also the abandoning of the mistaken Greek concept of individuality.

A philosophical, arty film its also subtle, full of Kieslowski's directorial magic, and gives the lead actress her most challenging role. There are two women, the Polish Veronika and the French Veronique ( Irine Jacob). They do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer. Each has the strange feeling that she is not alone in the world. When Veronika dies onstage while singing, suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling. Although Veronika has died, but she still lives and inhabits Veronika. She explores, searching for the truth about her double life, and meets a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.This film demands to be analyzed. Is it about being puppets in some enormous scheme of things? Like Descatres 'Demon Hypothesis'. Or about fate? Sacrifice, Love, a soul in two bodies? Political symbolism? Or is it simply about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? The symbols can be interpreted in various ways successfully and more ambiguously is the end happy or sad? Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction uses light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make Double Life a work of art. Metaphors about the inner states of the characters include the stars and leaves, are the personalities of Weronika and Veronique one a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around this film. Interpretion can be argued over endlessly. An exquisite jewel. A work for a gallery.

Bur director Krzysztof Kieslowski doesn't provide much else besides an affirmative answer, and the concept itself is limited because the two Veroniques are never allowed to meet (if they did the whole thing would be just another Twilight Zone episode, with subtitles). It's certainly a beautiful movie, with quite a few magical moments balanced against an unforgivably vague narrative concerned mostly with the French Veronique's pursuit of an enigmatic puppeteer. Along the way are some intriguing, teasing suggestions of several more-then-coincidental similarities between the two women, but the effect is not unlike watching a film where every third scene is missing, and because the burden of meaning is placed entirely on the viewer it will likely infuriate anyone expecting a more coherent story.

The idea is neat - there are two ladies, Weronika in Poland and Veronique in France, both played by excellent Irene Jacob, they meet only once and still just see each other in Krakow during the anti-Communist strike of 1990. Weronika the Pole is a great opera style singer, though she never studied this seriously before, she misses her Mom and comes to Krakow to her drinking Auntie. There, she gets attention and accepts the invitation to sing in serious concerts. But she is deadly ill and dies suddenly during her debut. Veronique lives in France, she is a teacher, she is quite happy with her love life, her relatives and her hobbies. Anyway, this is where the extreme boredom creeps in, while you are through the French part of the film. I am sorry for all those who love the film, but the excellent tempo and impeccable style start to evaporate at about last 40 minutes of the film, and then you only plead yourself to watch it till the end.

A lot of the people commenting here have already said it, but I will repeat it anyway Irene Jacob does a fantastic job in this film in terms of acting, and she's angelically beautiful too. Although there is very little dialogue, she conveys a huge amount to the audience - another example of Kieslowski's genius for visual narrative. Her performance, combined with the fantastic cinematography, shot composition and selection, and music, make this film a treasure to behold. Virtually every single frame of this film would look amazing if you blew it up and hung it on your wall in a picture frame, and I bet that if you sat blindfold in your living room while the film played, you would have a pretty amazing experience as well. The storyline of the film was admittedly fractured and vague a lot of the time, but sitting here a couple of hours after watching it, things are starting to click in my head. The Polish part was fine in terms of narrative, very engaging. Then we cross over to France, and we are shown a lot of tiny snippets of Veronique's life, which we immediately try to start piecing together to form a story. None of these snippets ever join together to form something concrete... this is Veronique's lostness and confusion as she searches for something to fill the void left by Veronika. At least that's what I think. There are still parts I don't understand, such as what exactly happened outside the cafe where she meets the puppeteer, and what happens at the end of the film when Veronique touches the bark of a tree and we see her father inside the house. Strange. Maybe I will understand more when I see the film again, which I certainly will - but probably best to wait at least 6 months. The only gripe I have with the film is that it seemed a bit drawn out and boring about 3/4 of the way through, when very little was happening... but I have to forgive Kieslowski this because a film this great doesn't come along very often.

In fact, the double life of Veronique is the leading, but not the main theme of the work.Consider the two halves of the movie corresponding to the lives of the two Veroniques. The second half of the film is mostly devoted to the strange and failed love encounter of the French Veronique. By making her lover a puppet player who can't resist manipulating or taking advantage of Veronique, either for his books or his plays, Kieslowski seems to hint to the idea of Veronique being no more than a puppet of life. This now becomes the main theme, in which the double life is but another product.But it was not essential to Kieslowski to simply hint at the mystery of life, so paradoxical as to produce the strange events shown in this film. As he later proved in RED, there IS an order of life, even if paradoxical to man's mind; an order capable of transcending - and transgressing - our rational perspectives. The only problem for Kieslowski - as for the puppet player/writer - was to make sure that these transgressions occur and are in fact possible. And it is here, IMHO, that the film fails I couldn't really believe the metaphor of two women being the same, at the same time, one feeling like the other, or one following the other's story. It is not like the (true) story of the journalist finding himself in a novel by Cortazar, who never knew him. This fact often quoted by Kieslowski, revealed to him the strange symmetry of life when rightly perceived by man and was the sort of rationally-twisting life symmetries that he wanted to show in his movies.But in this work these rationally-twisting symmetries are  too worked-out, too artificial to be credible. Given that this was the stuff of the color trilogy, the Double Life of Veronique may rightly be considered as a first approach to such major artistic and visionary problem.

This is like Kieslowski's unfinished symphony. It had the most promising storyline of all his efforts, but he went nowhere with it. Rather than developing what could have been a real mindbender, he chose to focus on symbolism, mood and camera technique.Film school students should love this flick. He does tons of wacky things like filming through a glass ball, through a man's spectacles (twice), through a distorted train window and, of course, using the trademark Kieslowksi microscopic close up on a cup of tea (ok, in Blue it was a cup of coffee, and in Dekalog 2 it was a glass of water...same friggin thing). But to people who don't go ga-ga over that sort of stuff--to people who are searching for good old fashioned literary substance--this'll be a somewhat aggravating experience.If you like impressionistic movies like Fellini's AMACORD or Tarkovsky's ZERKALO, then you'll probably love this film. But if you prefer the clearly-defined work of Kurosawa, Bresson or Kubrick, then I'd advise you to pass on this and check out Kieslowski's other works instead. Try the Three Colours trilogy & the Dekalog series...between those, there's 15 hours of good, classic Kieslowski to pique your brain.

Basically the story starts in Poland with the life of young Polish woman Weronika (Irène Jacob) who has a keen ambition to become a singer, and aside caring for her sick Aunt (Halina Gryglaszewska) in Kraków, she is prepared to leave most things to achieve this dream, including spending time with her boyfriend Antek (Jerzy Gudejko). She gets noticed by turning up at a concert rehearsal session, impressing the musical director with her beautiful high soprano voice and offered an audition, and eventually she is successful, and she reconnects with Antek who has been following her somewhat, but when she finally gets on stage to enchant an audience with her she sings her parts, but collapses and dies during performance. The story then shifts to Paris where on the same day young French woman Véronique (Irène Jacob), a doppelgänger who in a sudden moment feels grief and sadness, she teaches music and takes her class to see a musical piece by the same composer who performed with Weronika, conductor Van den Budenmayer (Aleksander Bardini), and in a few instances she hears more of his music playing in places. The next day she tells her father that she is in love, all of the sudden with a man she has never met, after receiving an odd shoelace in a letter envelope she believes it is from a puppeteer she has seen a few times, also a children's book author who in one his stories mentions a shoelace, Alexandre Fabbri (Philippe Volter), and she reads more of his work, and also hears more Budenmayer music, including sounds of a car accident. Véronique feels manipulated finding out that it was Alexandre wanting to gain her attention and meet again, she eventually lets him off and they sleep together and make love, and the next morning he finds a photo of Weronika that obviously looks just like Véronique, but she denies it is her as he is the one who took the photo. The end of the film sees Alexandre working on a new book, focusing on the lives of two women born on the same day in different cities of the world with a strange connection, obviously based on what he found falling with Véronique and finding out about Weronika. Also starring Kalina Jedrusik as Gaudy woman, Wladyslaw Kowalski as Weronika's father, Janusz Sterninski as Lawyer, Sandrine Dumas as Catherine and Louis Ducreux as Teacher. As the two identical women Jacob gives a performance worth watching, but I will be honest and say that I much preferred the first woman more than her second because she has an extraordinary singing voice that goes perfectly with the opera music, the second performance for lacked as much depth, in fact, I found after the first woman's death the rest of the film was a tiny bit slowed down, nevertheless overall it is a worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Good, in my opinion!

After listening to the audio commentary, I realize this is even more complicated film than I thought.I wasn't bored by it, but rather, perplexed. Knowing that it is Kieslowski film, instead tried to grab on to find its concept, I let the scenes express themselves as they are. I did have a haunting feeling through out the film, especially through the green or red dim mood coloring. It was intimate, yet mysterious surreal. Annette Insdorf's audio commentary of the Criterion Collection DVD did point out many connecting details and thoughts that did not revealed to me in my first viewing.After some more thoughts, I started to think that this movie really did fail to hold the audience in 2 ways 1) Krzysztof Kieslowski Although this movie is deeper than the eyes can see, it is even less entertaining movie than his others that I'd watched. The intrigue went as far as the movie title. After that all the clues are so obscured that without a guide, it is a total perplex. He had put so much effort into placing clues that he neglected to keep his audience. Granted, his meticulousness I do appreciate. Appreciating is different from enjoying. Green mix red is not an appealing color either, unlike the captivating colors in the three color trilogy.2) Irene Jacob She is truly one of the most beautiful actress in the last few decades. The movie showed the full array of her beauty and the glory of her curves, not to mention the full blown of her eroticism. However, I can't find her performance inspiring. This is an expressive movie, and it is essential that the leading character express convincingly, i.e. Irene Jacob alone by herself, which I did not find her successfully do although I have to say quite a load for her to carry playing 2 characters. A movie I think I can compare with is Wong Kar-Wai's In the Mood of Love. That movie would have been totally dull if Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung did not have their a great performance which I thought they had. I did not think Irene Jacob was tremendous either in Red though much better performance that this one. I thought Krzysztof Kieslowski did made Red interesting. Maybe I found that Irene Jacob is an overrated actress (was she ever considered as a good actress?), or perhaps Kieslowski is not the right director for her.It doesn't take away my appreciation of the grandeur spiritual message that I found in this movie, nor will it stops me from further watching Kieslowski's other movies, not at all.

While I still have no sympathy for anyone or anything in the movie, I think the movie is nevertheless a lot more coherent than I initially thought, and for this - and also for the excellent filmography - I am giving it an 8/10. (1)A friend of mine suggested this movie is about the various possibilities of existence which cannot be realized simultaneously in real life. I felt this wasn't right but I didn't have another interpretation to offer. But now I do. Let's see what Weronika and Veronique are all about(a) SimilaritiesThey are both sickly creatures. They have a father, they don't have a mother. They are both engaged with music. They know and interact with a series of characters of no consequence (the aunt, the colleague from school, etc.) They both appear in a love relationship where their lovers are more involved than themselves. They both dismiss those lovers. They both have a plastic (?) ball and are fascinated by what the world looks like as reflected through it. They both watch an old woman through the window. They both seem to drift without touching the world around them. They both see their doppelgänger.(b) DifferencesWeronika lives in Poland. She is not independent (lives with her dad / aunt). She seems young and inexperienced. She moves to another city for the sake of her aunt. Feels that she is not alone in the world. She dies singing.Veronique lives in France. She is financially independent (she lives on her own, has her own job). She seems more mature, and already anchored in music (she has a music teacher, she teaches music). She quits her music lessons although her teacher thinks she has a great talent. She feels alone in the world. She falls in love (Weronika never seems in love; talking to her aunt, she seems excited to have slept with that guy but abandons him). She accepts the game played on her by the anonymous stalker. She becomes acquainted with her puppeteer. She sees her doppelgänger, in the end. She begins to see how he may be the one manipulating her. Veronique's story begins as Weronika dies. This chronological details is supported by the photo / negative from Poland, which is the moment when the stories of the two girls become anchored in reality and aligned in a particular chronological order.So far, what does this movie seem to be about? Let's say that Veronique's first apparition and inexplicable grief is a premonition of what might happen to her if she continues taking music lessons / trying to make a career in music. This premonition leads her to abandon her existential possibility of realizing her potential through music. Having abandoned this possibility (I don't feel like it should be called her 'ideal' - Veronique doesn't really seem to have a passion, a dream, an ideal!), she somehow loses her path. Is she the ballerina who breaks her leg and then turns into a butterfly, as the ballerina in the puppeteer's story? This seems rather to be Weronika's story. Veronique refuses to break her leg, so there's no question of her turning into a butterfly. Is, then, the movie about a character with a talent for music to whom her talent is fatal, and for whom abandoning the talent would lead to perdition all the same? If yes, then the movie does make sense, although I'm still not sure about the puppeteer. It's as if the puppeteer had somehow condemned both these girls to death, and loves them when they have accepted their sentence. (Antek too could be some kind of a puppeteer he tells Weronika he loves her only after she had come to the city and was already pursuing her talent! Likewise, Alexandre too tells Veronique he loves her only after she had accepted to enter the game of the anonymous caller.)If this death sentence were the true meaning of the movie, then it also would be easier to understand why Veronique has two lovers (the first, unnamed one, and then, Alexandre), and Weronika only one Veronique quits music and drives away her first lover, and this could be a rejection of dying for her talent. Her condemnation to death is, however, still there having failed to kill her through music, the puppeteer steps in himself.The weird thing about this interpretation is that, although both girls do seem to have some relation to music, neither of them gives the impression that music is the biggest thing in their lives. Music is just something they happen to be good at, good enough to be remarked and regretted when they cannot / refuse to pursue it. For the rest, these girls look like lambs brought to the slaughterhouse. For example, when Weronika's aunt asks her how her audition had gone, Weronika answers something like (I don't remember the exact wording) it went TOO well. Apathetic...(2) My conclusion about the movieAfter lots of thinking, here's, then, my conclusion regarding what this movie is about I think it is about condemnation to death, regardless of other life details. This idea seems supported by that episode where Veronique holds the shoestring across the graph paper in a straight line over her recent EKG graph. The straight line of an EKG = death.Everything else in the movie is ballast. The doppelgänger thing is rather a red herring it muddles the waters without any pay-off, really.Now I understand why the music is throughout so sad / sinister. Also, why there is so much ballast, so many gestures of no consequence. So many attempts at a plot but with no actual realization. The characters are doomed, and that's all.

I think the director could have put anything on screen and had the same reviewers leaping about for the meaning of the symbolism. (In fact, some reviewers simply have it wrong - e.g., although the puppeteer is initially shown as manipulative, within five minutes, the main character is saying that she's always loved him - it is she, not he, who empties the contents of her purse when he says he wishes to know all about her).The movie is like a poem with many beautiful images and no point - except the myriad of meanings that different readers will impart to it. One needn't like American movies to want a story - it's a pretty human desire. One wants a point in virtually all poetry as well - there's a thread that carries one stanza into the next - whether one's reading Shelley or Heine or Rilke, Gautier or even Verlaine. They want to tell us something - this movie sets up the premise and lets it drift like a cloud.  There's a very Kafkaesque story-like feel to this movie. Yet in Kafka, the main character always seeks meaning - he is rational and is alternately cowed, defiant, driven in his attempts to find out the truth. Not so with our main characters here - they are aimless.As beautiful as this movie is, there's really no point to it. The movie asks a question what if...? and doesn't attempt to answer it.

This film is an exercise in banality compared to the remake, I Know Who Killed Me (2007), a modern day erotic masterpiece. I would also like to add that the picture quality here wasn't that great either. It is just a poor release of this film in almost every area. ...disjointed script bordering on HBO style erotica, with probably the worse subtitling I have ever seen. The movie ends abruptly like they just simply ran out of film. Avoid this one.For the amount of money the producers spent on this, the movie's quality is terrible. Everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed, and that's when you're lucky enough to view a scene that's actually in-focus. The sound is poorly dubbed, much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awful.Let's not kid ourselves here, all ye art students, film-school nerds, and other self-loathing cinema l'arte snobs had this exact same movie been released under the banner directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini you would have loved it - sorry CLAIMED to have loved it - and praised it to high heaven, espousing its virtues in long essays, justifying its extreme sex and violence through some b.s. semantic pseudo-intellectual movie-critic-jargon mumbo-jumbo. A corny, historically inaccurate, fairy-tale-like piece of crap like Gandhi gets world-wide recognition, while a brutally realistic film about another historical figure, called Caligula gets the finger. Go figure.Go on, admit it. No-one will laugh. We promise.

That's about all I can say about the plot of this movie because it leaves you guessing at everything else.  A bit of mystery and some unanswered questions that leave you pondering after a movie are okay, but this one left me thinking that the director and/or writer thought that their emotional imagery was enough and that the audience is owed nothing more.  I disagree.  This could have been a fantastic movie if there were more information provided.

We have seen some good ones like The Secret in Their Eyes, Other Peoples Lives and A very long Engagement. We had never seen a Krzysztof Kieslowski film and were very much looking forward to it. What a tremendous disappointment. We found almost nothing to like.The story line was weak and confusing. The entire atmosphere of the film was contrived and phony artiness. We almost turned it off several times but toughed it out to the bitter end hoping it would get better. When it was finally over we checked user ratings and noted it is most popular with under 18 year old males and we suspect this might be because what we have is soft-core pornography posing as art. A disappointing waste of time. Count this as two votes as it is from both my wife and I.Krzysztof Kieslowski is well liked and we hope to be able to redeem him when we watch his Red, White and Blue trilogy.

Usually I'll chalk it up to the average viewer's lack of patience for more intense, intelligent cinema. However, in this case, any ridicule of artistic excess seems just.This is a film where nothing much happens and not much makes sense. Why does Veronique have an exact double half-way across Europe? The film introduces this idea and then simply lets it float about without explanation. Of course the viewer is left perplexed and frustrated. What was the director trying to say? Did he even know what he was trying to say? There's plenty of symbolism throughout the film that is very cryptic, not offering the viewer much help towards deciphering the story.This film reminds me of a modern art gallery, where pretentious art experts endlessly debate the meaning of a black square inside a white square. Sometimes a piece of art can simply look interesting while saying nothing coherent or concrete. That is the case with this film. It's a collection of pretty pictures that don't add up in the end. I suppose one could re-watch this film a dozen times, trying to glean some sort of deeper meaning. However, I'll pass. It's brutally slow and tedious; the prospect of continually re-watching this dull tale is not very appealing.Perhaps this film is highly regarded because many reviewers feel it's so cryptic and strange, it simply must be an artistic masterpiece. No one wants to be the uncultured everyman to stand up and say, This film makes no sense. It's a pretentious mess. Nothing of interest happened and the characters are not at all compelling. The cinematography is beautiful and Irène Jacob is beautiful. Based on that, the film earns a 4/10.

Pretentious is the best word. The plot is poorly articulated, characters have no development, editing is illogical (what happened to the heroine's witnessing against an unknown man in the court?  did I miss something while yawning?).  The rare engaging moments to me were those with puppets - wonderfully made, with exquisite movements...  Irene Jacob is beautiful, so what?  Do you know anything about her character?  Did she provoke any intimate memories of your life?  Did you identify yourself with any of the characters?  Or were you just watching an emotionless variation on the subject, what if...?  Risking to sound blasphemous, I admit I see all Kieslowski's movies that way... emotionless, calculated, cold, though beautifully shot and starring strikingly beautiful women.

It concerns two women who are not related but are identical twins--complete with some sort of inexplicable psychic connection. That unexplained connection along with a relatively dull story line resulted in my being rather disengaged from the film. Stylistically speaking it is a lovely film, as were the director's trio of films Blue, White and Red--which I much prefer. Their stories also feature similar music, excellent cinematography and are VERY unusual films but they just kept me more interested and their stories just seemed better developed and less silly. To me, this is an interesting film but a bit of a misfire.

Unfortunately, I was really disappointed about that non-story, probably of new narrative with no traditional dramatic structure. The result is boring. Moreover, very weak points kill some of the moment unlikely situations, the clichés he is a famous writer with 10 books, she receives anonymous letters, a guy in the staircases coming out of the blue, poor actors in the second roles (the two colleagues or friends), a flasher in the street,...and that constant yellow filter on all images...I had to run out of the movie theater for some fresh air.

But this must be the most boring film I've ever seen (and I've seen many). I swear I was well awake when I hit the play button of my VCR. One hour later I had to struggle to keep my eyes open; because, I thought, I will get the sense of this movie, sooner or later. That never came! I didn't feel anything for, or learn anything from, Veronika or Veronique, except that they are two girls played by the same actress. Where's the beauty of this all? The filtered photography? The pointless coincidences? The lost looks in Jacob's face? Nice actress, but I looked that lost many times and that didn't make a movie out of my bad day.You know people say I want my two hours back? I thought it was an expression, but with this film I really felt that way. Better, I was honestly furious at the screenwriter and myself, for having been cheated.

This flick was not entertaining. Symbolism be damned. The movie was as annoying as many of the reviews posted on here, a bit over the top. Reviewers at this site are apt to try to impress readers with their literary skill. They read like the nonsense I remember printed on the covers of old LPs. Doublespeak. Please people, lets restrict our comments to plain old everyday English.I'm an American but prefer foreign movies to most of the action crap produced by Hollywood. This one was a bit much. The gloomy photography was annoying. The French Veronique was one short of a six pack. She never bothered to look at the photographs she took in Poland? She decided she was in love with her stalker after inviting him to her hotel room? Love? Both women were totally promiscuous and the viewer never knew the guys the women were having sex with.I'm sorry but I didn't get it. A waste of 100 minutes of my life. I could find similar symbolism watching paint dry. One poster, from Spain, took at swipe at at the American movie industry of which I am no great fan. However, his comments reflect the xenophobia is alive and well in Spain as it here here in the US. "}]
