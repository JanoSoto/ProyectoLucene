Best in Show strips the illusion away in a brutal satire that undoubtedly had every dog person on the planet cringing in horror and delight. Isn't that just like so-and-so? and I'm nothing like that!Christopher Guest may have topped his supreme masterpiece Spinal Tap with this signature mockumentary in which he skewers all of dogdom.  You will recognize Fred Willard's vapid and obnoxious television host as none other than Joe what's his name from Westminster, and the tension between him and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) is a thinly veiled roman a clef of David and Joe at the Big Show.There are a few gaffs, like the fact at all the dogs at the Show are supposed to be champions before entry, but that doesn't detract from the fun.  John Michael Higgins, who steals the show as the uninhibited handler, and Michael McKean are hilarious as the gay couple going out of their way to be outre. Co-writer Eugene Levy (American Pie) is perfect as the husband finding out that his wife Catherine O'Hara might be Miss Congeniality of all time. I also loved Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock as the overwrought yuppie couple who project all their angst on their poor dog.  Larry Miller turns in a great cameo as one of the countless men in O'Hara's past.A lot of people didn't get this gem.  To them I can only say Bad Dog, Bad Dog!

When the advertising for Best in Show had the tagline From the Team That Brought You Waiting for Guffman, a fair number of critics out there implied in their reviews that only people that are familiar with the film or its filmmakers and cast would have a good time seeing this film. For shame, critics, for shame times two!  Any critic that implies something like that with any film probably doesn't want to share the film's wealth with the rest of the world, but this is one film that I hope people will experience, now that its video/dvd. Best in Show is, without a doubt,  the best comedy of 2000.The film begins with a mockumentary style, introducing the main competitors (not to mention screwballs) of the annual Mayflower Best In Show competition, where dogs of all breeds come to compete to see who is the top dog. We have the loveable and gullable Harry Pepper (Guest) with his bloodhound, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) with their terriors, nut-case yuppies Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey), the gay dog groomers Scott Dolan & Stefan Vanderhoof (Higgins & McKean), and the airheaded millionare Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) along with her trainer Christy Cummings (Lynch).  They all have their minds on one simple object The Blue Ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. And...do I have to tell you the rest?Director/writer/star Guest's idea of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies out there that are worth laughing at, and that the idiocy of films like American Pie or other pointless teenage flicks won't take over the world after all. His idea is simple make your comedy not just funny, but SMART funny. But instead of following in the brilliant footsteps of films like Zero Effect and High Fidelity, he used a rather unusual approach (and as I understand, he also used this approach for Guffman). Whether you notice or not, a very large part of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do were probably not written in the script, maybe even not even dreamed of by Guest and co-writer/star Levy. But with a gentle hand from Guest, he and the actors pulled off a hilarious theatrical feat that probably would have flopped if handled by other, less adept actors.  Now that's smart!The cast is, of course, what makes improv work the most. All of them are a (comedic) marvel to behold, especially Guest as Pepper. But the real standout has to be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the clueless announcer at the competition who can spin out the most outrageously funny stories and comments that no announcer would even dream of...that is, if the announcer was trying to be funny. Williard can go from talking about the dog to suddenly going on and on about how much he can bench press. There's even a part were he gives out an idea for a new marketing strategy have sexy women pose in tight shirts and shorts with the dogs and imply something like have a doggie-style of a time. Its priceless, as is his performance.I hope that people engage in this 90-minute dogumentary. The film deserves so much recognition. It did get nominated for Best Picture-Comedy at the Golden Globes, but didn't win. I can't see why. I mean, in the comedy department, it is best in show.GRADE A "},{"Title":"Dog people, amusing enough in real life, are much more so in Christoher Guest's master mockumentary.","Date":"2 March 2001","Score":"33 out of 40 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Best in Show (2000) Directed by Christopher Guest. Written by Guest and Eugene Levy. Starring Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock, Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean, Guest and Fred Willard. Running Time 90 minutes   Rated PG-13Dog people, and the dogs that own them, are often amusing in real life. But in the hands of master mock documentarist Christopher Guest, the amusement is marvelously magnified. (Guest practically invented the mockumentary with his 1984 rock band send-up, This is Spinal Tap.)In the days leading up to the Mayfair Kennel Club Dog Show, several sets of contestants make their way to Philadelphia to realize a dream of being Best in Show. There's a pair of New York yuppies (Posey and Hitchcock) who are even higher strung than their willful weimaraner. A gay couple (Higgins and McKean) shows up to show off their shih tzu. A Florida husband and wife (Levy and O'Hara) make the trip with their terrier, discovering along the way that every man they meet is one of her former lovers. And finally, springing fully-grown from a country music song, lonely guy Harlan Pepper (Guest) arrives from North Carolina in a pickup truck with his droop-faced bloodhound. Once at the show, the odd assortment of owners conduct their canines toward a best in show showdown, where brilliantly inept color commentary is provided by Buck Laughlin (Willard).Even though fairly well known actors play the primary roles, Guest achieves a documentary feel, mainly because much of the dialogue seems improvised. As writer-director, he deserves credit, either for writing sharp dialogue, or for directing in a way that inspires creativity in his actors.Some of the best lines come from Posey and Hitchcock, the yuppie couple who met when their eyes locked as they sipped coffee at separate but close-by Starbucks, and whose pooch becomes paranoid whenever they get intimate in its presence. The other cast members ably deliver lines that define their quirky characters. Especially good is O'Hara as a woman with a past who is nonetheless devoted to spouse Levy, who literally has two left feet. Even the background extras, probably real-life dog handlers, are fascinating to watch, and seem to inhabit their own documentaries, waiting for their own close-ups.The last third of the film brings the entire cast together for the Best in Show competition. This is where Willard, who seems to have wandered in from a slow day at the XFL, delivers his wildly comic commentary, which amazes and befuddles his more serious partner. (For a while, there was actually some Oscar buzz for Willard's performance here.) Though the film pokes fun at the dog show circuit, it also reveals a fondness for the people involved. It may not inspire you to become a dog show person, but it just may have you looking in the classifieds to see when the next real-life show is coming to your town.Rating  3.5 stars out of 4###  "},{"Title":"Intelligent, Hilarious, Restrained, Balanced Humor","Date":"27 December 2004","Score":"31 out of 44 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, to have a movie made and performed by Americans come out that is well paced and full of charm as well as hilarity is well-nigh miraculous.

Best in Show would be on and although she hadn't seen it, she'd heard it got great reviews.I kept working and forgot the time. The telly was on but I ignored it. All of a sudden I began hearing this very weird dialog. 'We like the same things - soup, snow peas, talking - and not talking.' I thought to myself 'what is this - some kind of weird porn movie?' And I continued ignoring it for a while longer until I heard the voices of Levy and Begley Jr. It was then I remembered what the girlfriend had said.I looked the movie up at the IMDb quickly and was surprised to see who was behind it Christopher Guest aka Nigel Tufnel, the man with the extra loud guitar amplifier. I knew then I was lucky to still be awake to witness this one.I made two more checks at the IMDb before getting back to the movie the number of awards and nominations and the box office. Not surprisingly this was a low budget venture, and not surprisingly either it's garnered tonnes of awards and nominations. The studio made a profit off this one, but it's pocket change in comparison to the big blockbusters. Still, it must be a kind of Woody Allen and Orion kind of thing movies like this make the studio look good.On to the movie it's a riot, a bloody riot. It might not be your cuppa, but then OK - turn it off or watch something else. But there is so much in this one - it plays a bit like an Altman. Lots of hand-held too. And when you finally get to the show itself on comes Fred Willard and takes it away. He uses Jim Piddock as a foil - actually he uses almost everything as a foil. And if you think his portrayal is too much over the top, reflect on the fact it's supposedly a copy of an actual commentator at shows of this kind.This type of movie is either extraordinarily difficult or admirably easy to make, and I suspect it's a bit of both. Some of the skits are just too much, and everywhere you turn the acting is inspired. One scene with I believe Posey in a pet shop is precious - and not only her work but the shop assistant's. Amazing stuff.Mostly my sympathies went to Begley Jr who was the receptionist at the hotel. Meeting all these weird types and trying to remain accommodating and representative - it must be difficult if not impossible. There are some very weird characters in this one.And you may be asking yourselves 'watch a mockumentary about a dog show and its participants?'

The audience responded affirmatively in both instances, and such began the movie.  If you answer yes to both of these questions, this is a must-see movie.  If you answered no, you should still see this satirical romp following the actions of the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. The director, writer and star of Best in Show, Christopher Guest, is no newcomer to fake documentaries.  As the lead guitarist in the aforementioned This Is Spinal Tap (1984) and the director, writer and star of Waiting for Guffman (1997), he is perhaps the master of the field, exploring a common theme, as reflected in the Guffman tag line There's a good reason some talent remains undiscovered. Guest explores this theme further in Best in Show, looking at ordinary people not mockingly but almost tenderly.  You understand the characters' fears and insecurities, and you can only see too much of people you know or yourself in them.  More importantly, you like these characters.  When Eugene Levy's character Gerry Fleck reacts to his wife Cookie's (Catherine O'Hara) past wild sex life, you know that this is a man who loves his wife and whom his wife loves, despite his huge dorkiness and her having slept with almost every man they meet.  Pookie and I work as a team, he says, and they do, singing in harmony about their beloved terrier. The other characters are as banal and human as they can be; the braces-wearing yuppie couple, played with aplomb by Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock, take their dog to a therapist because the dog is depressed and angry about having seen the couple in the Congress of the Cow Kama Sutra position.  They wax poetic about having been raised amongst catalogues, extolling the virtues of J. Crew and L.L. Bean, and describe their similarities as loving soup, outdoors, snowpeas, talking and not talking. These two are perhaps the most caricaturistic and one-dimensional of the characters in the film, but you feel sad for them for their transference of parental instinct onto their woeful dog. Best in Show has its share of comedic highs, most notably, the interplay between Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), the hopelessly clueless commentator, and Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock), the British dog expert.  As Buck barrages Trevor with inane and hilarious questions, Trevor brings up the most specific detail about the different breeds and the particular judges. Buck reminds me of my Uncle Bob, the man who doesn't know anything about anything but talks about it anyway, and it's perhaps the funniest part of the movie. This movie is kind to its characters while making fun of them, and the result is hilarity.  While I'm curious about the new Tim Meadows' vehicle The Ladies Man, this is the most original and, arguably, the funniest comedy out right now.

The plot surrounds the contestants--dogs--and their owners as they venture into the world of competitive dog...OK, it's about a dog show. The owners truly are characters, as one would have to be to be so attached to their dogs. That's really all there is to it, but that makes it funny enough.You'd never be able to convince me that a mock-u-mentary about dog shows would be funny prior to catching the hilarious scene where Levy and O'hara visit Larry Miller's house on TV...but that's really all it takes to convert any doubters. Spinal Tap was non-stop hilarity, joke after joke whereas Best in Show was had a few more lulls (and by that I mean say 3 minute at MOST where something riotously funny doesn't happen), but the big laughs are even bigger.The casting in this one is great and even the typically out of place in, uh movies in general Parker Posey does a fine job. In fact, her tirade directed at Ed Begley Jr. and a pet store owner over a lost dog toy is probably the funniest running gag of the film.What's amazing about this movie to me is how the writers somehow managed to weave a plot, simple as it was, around these great jokes so that it actually felt like it had direction. I guess there's a freedom in having such a minimal plot. Everyone's role is pretty well crafted here and the characters are rarely over-the-top. The realism of how pathetic they seem to the outsider is what makes it funnier than Mighty Wind or the uneven Guffman. I actually encounter wierdos like this now and then. If you like Guest's stuff at all, you should definitely own this one.

I was impressed on my first viewing, but when I watched it after having learned that virtually every scene is improvised, I was amazed.

A movie about the idiosyncrasies of dog owners that show their dogs competitively, it's the intricacies of the characters that make it so good. After watching the movie about 75 times I have come to the conclusion that there is no weak character or actor in this film. There is very little interaction between any of the groups of characters but that only seems to add to the beauty of the film. If you watch this movie and don't find it as funny as I am billing it as, watch it again. The first time I saw it I thought it was serviceable but not overly hilarious. It is a film that grows on you. Defininatly a movie that you will find yourself quoting frequently. Characters Hamilton and Meg Swan A+ if you get the DVD check out how these characters were born amazing that these two could hit it so on the head. And to find out that they really didn't go by a script and sort of made it up as they went. Gerry and Cookie Guggleman A Cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the Cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) delivers his standard stellar performance of the hilarious discombobulated type weaker half. Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A+ Find me a funnier character than Scott Donalan, I DARE YOU! He will forever be typecast as this character to me as he was so natural and didn't seem forced at any point. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was very good as well and they interplay here (and a brief appearance with the Gugglemans) goes to show why he is always in these films. A great actor with razor like wit. Harlan Pepper- B+, I don't want it to seem like he isn't funny, he sure is but being the only Solo act he can't be quite as funny as the others above. He does use the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies going for him.The rest are all great as well, there is no weak character. See this film at least twice.

The characters themselves are delightful, both human and canine. The comedy varies from very subtle to obvious but never becomes ridiculous. Many things will not be noticed on the first viewing. This is one of those films that can be trotted out frequently and still be as funny as ever. The film was written by Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy who also star in it; Guest directed it. They and much of the cast were also in Waiting for Guffman. The cast consists predominantly of improv comedians from Second City, National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live. The scene concepts were planned but there were no rehearsals; the actors improvised the dialogue, resulting in very spontaneous interaction between the characters. The actors could plan things that they wanted their characters to say but they might not get the chance to use much of what they planned; it all depended on what the other characters would say. Different takes of the same scene could be completely different. Over sixty hours of film were taken and the editing took about eight months. The film culminates in the big Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. There are two commentators one, Trevor Beckwith (British actor Jim Piddock, who was required to study everything that he could about dogs and dog shows), is an expert on dogs and the local, Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard, who was instructed to learn nothing about dogs), obviously knows nothing about dogs except, perhaps, that they have four legs and two genders; they interacted with great hilarity. Three of the five dog show judges were actually show dog judges; the other two were actors. Most of the dog handlers in the show were not actors.

As for their latest, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION, the less said the better.The film appears to be a documentary about dog shows and several contestants in particular. You follow these few chosen dogs from pre-show preparations all the way to the big night where one of them is chosen best in show at the fictitious Mayflower Kennel Club. However, none of these people are real dog show enthusiasts but talent improvisational actors that parody many of the common types of people you meet in the dog show world. Amazingly, even though the characters are rather outlandish, there is a lot of truth to the personalities they are parodying--as decades ago I had some experience with dog shows and this is a VERY cutthroat group of people! My favorites of the dog owners were the incredibly high-pressure and tense yuppie couple who just exuded anger and volatility. I also loved the openly gay couple, as they were terribly funny and clever. However, the best performance probably wasn't from any of the couples but from Fred Willard who played the world's stupidest and least talented announcer in human history. His comments were uniformly inane and often betrayed him as an incredibly stupid person--how he got to be the announcer for such a prestigious show is anyone's guess. The other contestants featured were also quite funny--the high-priced professional poodle handler and its rich owner, the country boy and his hound as well as Winkie's parents who could barely scrape together enough to make it to the show.Despite the improvised style of film making, the pieces all fit together wonderfully and told a very funny and compelling story--one that is NOT for dog owners only.

In a movie full of side-splitting moments, two of the best scenes are actually pretty poignant and emotionally touching. Both are near the end. The first is when dog owner Jennifer Stiffler's Mom Coolidge and dog handler Jane Lynch realize they've fallen in love, and embrace. The second is a reaction shot of dog owner Michael McKean, when the winner is announced and it's not McKean's pooch. For a fraction of a second, he shows disappointment, then gives a little shrug, smiles and heartily applauds the winner. McKean's character also happens to be gay, by the way, and there is a strong gay sensibility throughout this lark of a movie, so it will not be for everyone. But if you want funny, wait until you see Cathleen Home Alone O'Hara limping around moments before she's about to walk her dog down the runway. Hubby Eugene American Pie Levy takes over, with incredibly comical results. Also, every word out of show commentator Fred Willard's mouth is to die for. He plays a blue Joe Gargiola type, and apparently improvised most of his lines. There's also some hysterical business featuring a highly strung Parker Posey trying to track down her poochie's lost toy. Posey has never been better. Guest assigns himself the role of a good-hearted backwoodsman taking his hound dog to its first national meet. Wait until you see their scenes together!

My wife walked out after 10 minutes. In a fit of generosity I gave it a 6 of 10, only after I viewed the DVD version with the director's commentary turned on.The director and co-writer is Christopher Guess, who also stars as Harlan Pepper, a country bumkin who is showing his bloodhound, and studies ventriloquism on the side.  The other co-writer is Eugene Levy who stars as Jerry Fleck, who meets up with another of his wife's ex-lovers almost everywhere they go. Jerry as two left feet, literally.To say the movie was written is a bit of a stretch because, as Guess and Levy explain, all scenes and dialog were improvised, with no rehearsals. Except for Parker Posey, who plays the out-of-control housewife, all the actors are veterans of improvisation, and most have worked together in other movies.  The whole film has the feel of improvisation, and the look of a hand-held home movie, but with better sound. Instead of using selective focus to isolate the subject, almost everything is in focus in most scenes.Fred Willard was the most entertaining. Many of us have seen him regularly in comic skits on the Jay Leno late night TV show. He was one of the two announcers at the dog show, and his questions and comments never fit, but were funny because of that. How do they get those Scnauzers to become minature? Do they shrink them? Do you know they eat dogs in some cultures? That judge, examining the dog's testicles, I would be uncofortable on a date with her!The dog show brings forth the gay couple, the quarreling couple, the March/December couple, and so forth. After best in show is picked, and everyone goes their separate ways, the short epilog shows how the show influenced them and what they did afterward. The funniest was the calendar the gay couple were making, showing two dogs posed as various famous movie characters.Why do I think this is a mediocre movie?  It is obviously a vanity project. Guess and Levy apparently said, let's make a comedy with lots of funny people and sight gags, let's use improvisation, and use a dog show in Philadelphia as a reason for following the lives of all these fringe personalities.  I found it entertaining for the most part, but also found Parker Posey's acting to be too much over the top, and found myself cringing instead of laughing. Too many of the gags came across as forced humor.  While I admire the project, having made many home movies myself when my children were growing up, overall the effort misses the entertainment mark of a major film.

Bad mistake the less personality the dogs have, the less their owners have.  It's lucky that at least some of the owners have so much anyway.

Best in Show was cleverly filmed, but it left me ambivalent about whether I'd lost or invested 1.5 hours.The banality of the yuppies-mit-braces was pretty surprising.  At the end of the film, I didn't believe for a *second* that they'd ever even heard of the Kama Sutra, much less practised it behind unlocked doors.  The sum of narcissism, projection and earth tones isn't humor - adding the bland (smug? freaked-out?) weimeraner isn't terribly funny, either.Where did Leslie go?  Wherefore?  The sexual politics involved in this relationship are only intermittently provocative or funny.  There's an old-ish SNL skit about a Loni Anderson liking soup - if it's come to the point of Christopher Guest offering homage to anything on NBC, I'm sad.Happily, Guest's caricatures were handled gracefully.  The Pine Nut native is treated with dignity, which is rare in a country rife with you're a redneck if... jokes.

And he was right. In BEST IN SHOW, Guest (and writing pal Eugene Levy) struck a kind of comic apotheosis; they don't mock AKC-type shows at all, but they have a wonderful time dishing up a fictional set-in-Philadelphia dog show to show the many off-center but All-American type dog owners and their interaction. Fred Willard plays the TV color man, whose every remark strives for wit but bespeaks a deep, deep ignorance of the topic (The sporting dogs; those are the 'jocks' of the dog world, aren't they?)Perhaps it's Guest's British origin that gives him the required comic distance to craft a view so wonderfully skewed as in BEST IN SHOW. Certainly his many years in the USA give him great comic insight into the type of people whose foibles play in a movie. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are the Swans, a couple of shrill perfectionist yuppies from suburban Chicago. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hare are the Flecks, a very typical middle-class couple from Ohio except that he has two left feet and she has round heels (a running joke in the film, as she is forever running across past lovers, to hubby's consternation). The ever-funny Jane Lynch plays a lesbian kennel owner with an eye for a rich man's wife (Jennifer Coolidge). Michael McKeon and John Michael Higgins are gay beauty-salon operators; the McKeon character could pass for straight but when Higgins' flames, he is a holocaust. And best of all, C. Guest himself plays Harlan Pepper (love that name!), a molasses-mouthed, low-key North Carolina hunter.All I can do is sketch the players and open the way to the real treat of this movie the comic dialog, much of it improvised. I would rather not deal with that here, because the lines and their delivery are the real spoilers and the reason this film transcends mere sketch humor and becomes something of a study in tragi-comic American types.

Along the way Guest allows his very talented cast of actors to improvise their way into uncharted hilarity skillfully skewering the vacant, pompous and ridiculous extents people will take to preen over their pets (like his previous films, Guest outlines a script rather than provide extensive dialogue and it clearly is his forte) oblivious to their grotesqueries.There are so many side-splitting scenes from cuckolded Levy constantly being bombarded by frank sexual talk about his betrothed (particularly in a stop over to O' Hara's numerous exes, memorably played by a horny Miller); the anal retentive hotel manager portrayed by Begley (who accomodates from one extreme to the other but ultimately on the hygenic ways his staff will go to at lengths whenever the dog show is in town); to the flamboyant double entendres tossed by Higgins and his flashy clothing (8 count 'em 8 silk komonos for a 48 hour stint!). But hats off to Willard who steals the show as the event's color commentator Buck Laughlin whose inept improvisatory will have you laughing out loud and reveling on the nice riff he does of all those doofus sports announcers who think they know everything and kudos to his straight-man Piddock as Trevor Beckwith, who manages to implode with dignity.Easily one of the funniest films of this year or in any year and it's always a pleasure to have a most welcome Guest as the host to showcasing limited talent so eloquently.

He devotes much of his energy to insulting the judges and handlers, asking idiotic questions about dogs and their capabilities, telling lewd stories and making tortured baseball analogies.

It works because the actors in the ensemble cast are all adept at improvised comedy, so it's a film full of little moments rather than a major story arc.Spinal Tap's Christopher Guest directs as well as acts in this one. He certainly has a feel for the mockumentary genre and has contributed to many of the best ones out there. I would probably describe Best in Show as amusing rather than hilarious though. There are a few laugh-out-loud funny moments though, such as the scene revealing the man with two left feet; while virtually every line uttered by the TV commentator played by the excellent Fred Willard is comedy gold. Truthfully, mixed in with the best material are some more strained jokes. However, as a whole, it works pretty well and the talented cast elevate the material when it falters on occasion. All-in-all, a solidly enjoyable movie. "},{"Title":"A good show. But not the best.","Date":"25 September 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" It's another Christopher Guest mockumentary and with a cast full of certified comic geniuses it's hard to see how Guest could go wrong. Look at who Guest has at his disposal Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKean, Parker Posey, Fred Willard. Is that enough? No? OK, let's toss in Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Ed Begley, Jr. And of course there's also Guest himself as a key part of the ensemble. These are hilariously funny people. Which makes the fact that this is not a hilariously funny movie a little puzzling. Best in Show is funny but not outrageously so. A funny idea, certainly a funny cast, but not a consistently funny movie. There are a few really funny moments. But the movie ends up producing more wry smiles than big laughs. It leaves you wanting more.The movie takes place in the rather bizarre dog show world. We focus on five dogs, and their inevitably strange owners, as they make the trek to and ultimately compete in the big dog show in Philadelphia. There's a guy who literally has two left feet and whose wife apparently has slept with every man on the planet. There's a campy gay couple and a neurotic yuppie couple. A trophy wife, married to an oblivious elderly man, and her lesbian dog handler. And an aspiring ventriloquist. All in all a weird bunch. At times perhaps a little too weird for the movie's good. A lot of strange things happen to these strange people. Some of these things are funny but there are a bunch of gags and jokes which fall flat. The movie perks up a bit when we finally get to the dog show itself. That is thanks largely to the presence of Willard who plays perhaps the world's worst television color commentator. He's clearly the funniest thing this movie has going for it. All the other performers do reasonably well but there are times where things just seem a bit off. Maybe the story doesn't quite work, maybe the characters aren't really developed properly. With all these great comic stars you expect hilarity and you don't really get that. The stars do the best they can with the material but you feel that the material let them down a bit. They all have their moments. Posey in particular does really well. And even in a film chock-full of performers with such notable reputations there's room for some lesser-known actors, such as Michael Hitchcock and John Michael Higgins, to turn in good work as well. There's just the sense that director Guest didn't quite pull it all together. This is a movie with such a great cast. That cast could have been put to a little bit better use. Best in Show had such great promise. But just as only one dog can win the trophy not every film is destined for greatness. This film falls a little bit short.

Catherine O'Hara is married to Eugene Levy with his insane glasses. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are an uptight couple. Jennifer Coolidge is married to an old geezer and Jane Lynch plays her trainer. There is a big problem in this movie. The separate teams have a hard time getting together because they don't really function as a team. They are separate and they stay separate. It limits their interactions and limits the possibility of comedy. It becomes a series of the characters separate and talking into the camera with wacky stories or having a wacky time. It's not until halfway through the movie that the characters start getting together as they prepare for the dog show.

BIS delivers exactly as you hope it will, and Catherine O'Hara is always a treasure. So let's cut to the downside. In each mockumentary, Guest always takes it a little too far, and kills his own humor. For instance, in 'Guffman', it was absurd that Corky would end up owning a theatrical gift shop in NYC, but even more wrong was the 'Remains of the Day' lunchbox. It's a great joke but it's TOTALLY out of character - Corky would have no idea that this film existed. Just as, here, it is too surreal that a hotel clerk would offer a utility closet to a poor couple. It's not funny because Guest ventures beyond basic reality; aside from the ridiculousness of the clerk going so far to do this, it's insane that hotel liabilities would be overlooked. Yes, I know, this sounds picky, but a funny documentary MUST stay on earth to stay funny. Similarly, Cookie's past sex life is taken way too far, especially in the visit to the old BF. All of this would work beautifully if Guest would just keep his fantasy a little real. But it's still a pip. See it.

And this effort by Christopher Guest and pals certainly hits the target, though it isn't quite a bullseye. Best in Show is a mockumentary about five show dogs and their often eccentric owners competing in what appears to be the Super Bowl of dogs shows in Philadelphia. More often than not it makes you laugh, and it certainly makes you feel sorry for the dogs in these kinds of shows.Director Christopher Guest plays a redneck owner of an enormous bloodhound from North Carolina. This is obviously a lonely guy with maybe a few too many hobbies. We also see him as a ventriloquist, a guy who can name every kind of nut there is, and he even runs a bait shop. After the competition, he even takes a jaunt to Israel to work on one of those collective farms they have. Other contestants are a pampered standard poodle owned by a trophy wife and trained by her lesbian lover, one of a pair of tiny shi-tzus owed by a flamingly gay couple of guys, a shaggy terrier owned by a borderline white trash couple from Florida, and some other odd kind of dog owned by an annoying yuppie couple. The camera just seems to follow these people and their dogs around while the characters spout mostly improvised dialog as if they were really being interviewed instead of acting. Its good for a lot of laughs.The redneck and the gay men get most of the laughs. Guest went to great depths to depict his Harlan Pepper character as a man with just too much going on in his own head and too much time on his hands. Michael McKeon and John Michael Higgins are good as the gay men. Maybe a little too good! Jennifer Coolidge (Stifler's mom for those of you American Pie fans) and Jane Lynch have characters that at least keep you guessing for a while about the true meaning of their relationship. I think I recognized the old codger who played Blue in Old School as Coolidge's husband! The film doesn't quite strike gold with the other two dog owning couples, though. Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock are WAY too over-the-top as the yuppies. They could have been fitfully annoying without the tantrums. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy are believable lower income Floridians, but the script overdoes it in ramming the point home about her promiscuity. And their dog seemed the least likely to win. Was this also some kind of joke? 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.

The outré humor which coated Guest's Waiting For Guffman in 1996 (and had, at times, a sour residue) is toyed with here in a much more loving way. I got the feeling Guest genuinely liked this group of characters better than the Guffman bunch; and though he does poke and prod at them with his camera--and encourage his actors to go all the way with the material--the nimble editing never wears them out, and the picture does not overstay its welcome. *** from **** "},{"Title":"Some good fun to watch.","Date":"15 March 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" If you like a more subtle comedy, this is a great movie for you to watch. It features a wide variety of a bunch of odd characters and a main story situated around a dog-show.Well, to be honest, there isn't really much story in this movie actually. It's a fake documentary, or mockumentary, focusing on the world of dog-shows and their owners. The first halve of the movie mostly consists out of fake interviews with the characters about them and their dogs, while the second halve concentrates more on the travel to- and the actual dog-show. The movie is not always made credible as a fake documentary because of its way of filming, editing and overall story-telling, so the movie is more stuck somewhere between a mockumentary and just a subtle comedy. Not that this makes the movie any less fun to watch though. It's obvious director Christopher Guest tried to make his own This Is Spinal Tap, a movie and early fake documentary he was involved with previously as an actor, song writer, composer and writer. He also does all of those things in this movie by the way and then some more as well.It's obvious director and writer Christopher Guest let his actors do a whole lot of improvisation and gave them lots of room to play. At times he just lets the camera role and let the actors do their thing. They come up with with things at times as they just go along. Some of the actors handle this better than the others. I think this is because every actor is itself is very individualistic and want to do things their way, which is not always possible when the actors opposite you is having a monologue concerning the other actor opposite and all you can do is respond to it and just go along with the other actor. Some actors on the other do know how to handle this and go along perfectly with it, such as for instance Eugene Levy. Who must have really enjoyed his improvisations was Fred Willard, as the commentator of the big dog-show. Man, some of the stuff he says is absolute great and hilarious.The characters and the sort of not everyday and sort of odd background story of a dog-show is what makes this movie work and fun to watch. It's a real subtle sort of comedy that doesn't try to be funny in a forced way but let the actors and characters be the center of the movie its comedy instead, without trying to make them look too funny and more real and humane like, despite all of their oddness's.It's a fun in-between movie to watch, just like this was a fun in-between movie to make for the actors involved I'll bet.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"It keeps getting funnier...","Date":"14 January 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" every time I see it!

It's fun to see a movie that is much quieter, with sly jokes that seem more genuine than standard written jokes. Best In Show, directed by This Is Spinal Tap star Christopher Guest, who also directed Waiting for Guffman, is an exercise in improve comedy, and that allows for drier wit and more genuine sounding humor. No one-liners for most of the film, just characters who, yes, they are odd, but are harmless. The movie revolves around a series of dog owners, taking their pride and joy to the national championship of dog shows in Philadelphia. The film is presented as a documentary chronically the movements of the participants, so we get back stories and character studies in these people, many of which have interesting aspects. Take the Eugene Levy character (Levy by the way is a co-writer with Guest, which means he either thought of the dog show premise, or the movie's title), Jerry Fleck. Fleck is a big-and-tall salesman who happens to have two left feet, literally. And he's just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the comic performers have backgrounds in sketch comedy, and it pays off in the free-form movie. The most memorable character, probably the only one with written lines, is Fred Willard's TV reporter character. Those memorable one-liners take on sports play-by-play announcers in a character who got the Mayflower ship and Christopher Columbus mixed up. Who wins the dog show? It doesn't really matter.

Here we have an array of participants, each matched with a dog who has a shot in the final round of competition--Best in Show. Guest does a dead-on backwoods impersonation as he drags his bloodhound to the competition. His usual flair for accents and unique characterizations is on full display. Levy and O'Hara are a mismatched, hilarious pair who hope their Norwich Terrier will take top honors. He is a nerd with two left feet (literally!) who gazes in amazement as total strangers seem to come out of the woodwork to reminisce with O'Hara about previous sexual encounters. O'Hara is so game with this and looks so right with her glossy make-up and trashy hair that it continues to be funny right up until the end of the film. Another couple (Posey and Hitchcock), a set of catalog-obsessed urban professionals, caters to their dog's every psychological whim, real or imagined. The favorite of the competition is a standard poodle, owned by buxom married-for-money Coolidge and trained by militant Lynch. Coolidge is mesmerizingly tacky with her lips out to there and nails constantly digging into some type of food. She is intriguingly offset by the plain, driven Lynch. The final contenders in the film are an outre and hysterical gay couple (McKean and Higgins.) Higgins portrayal is so right, so committed and so authentic despite the outrageousness, that he threatens to walk off with the picture. The film is virtually all ad-libbed and his are among the very best...including some that were sadly left out of the final cut, but which are gratefully found on the DVD. The melange of characters is just odd enough and varied enough to hold interest, yet real enough that they can create concern about the outcome. The whole shebang is given a ludicrously funny play-by-play from Willard as an unctuous commentator. His goal seems to be to crack up his painfully straightfaced cohort (Beckwith), who admirably holds it together.

It's not a laugh out loud comedy, but it will get you to consistently chuckle as all the quirks and flaws of these 'normal' people are slowly exposed like acne on a teenager.Modeled after an old SCTV comedy with a 'serious' facade giving away to complete absurdity.

Also has a Florida couple who max out their credit cards and are forced to stay in a hotel utility room.  Fred Willard as a off the wall dog show announcer and a six months later wrap up are also a standout.The only real quibble is that it becomes a true comedy movie and not the mock documentary it was intended to be.

I'm not a Spinal Tap junkie, had to turn American Pie off, it was too same-old. Those who don't like the characters are either too brain-dead to appreciate the subtle humor, or are too sophisticated to like anything. It's been a long time since I've found a video worth watching lately, everything is the same-old tired stuff. Its nice to find something that I might even watch twice. (I found another one during the same rental. If you like interesting characters, intelligent/skillful story-telling, check out Lone Star.) My favorite characters were the gay couple, but it was fun watching Christopher Guest play a good ole' boy, when I know him best as Count Rugen in The Princess Bride.However, the announcer character was just too asinine. While the kooky characters aren't realistic, it is possible to believe in them, but not the crude and lame announcer, who spoiled it. Chevy Chase would have been a better fit. I can't believe that some of those who liked the subtle humor of the rest of the show, thought the announcer was the best part.PARENTAL WARNING Most young children won't get this movie, but may sit through it for the kookiness. There are several scenes that I wouldn't feel comfortable having a preteen watch description of a sex act, gays kissing, blunt references to sex acts, a fairly explicit photo of gay exhibitionism.

It's a very funny picture, albeit not as biting as `This Is Spinal Tap', probably due, in part, to Guest's co-scenarist, Eugene Levy, whose gentleness also comes through in his role as one of the entrants, a shy bumbler--he actually has two left feet.(Guest himself plays another, a mild-mannered good ol' boy.) The bile, such as there is, is reserved for a repressed couple (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock) who channel their frustrations with each other into their pooch. Guest doesn't seem to want to aim for high targets, settling, instead, on providing a pleasant diversion and while his subject is an inspired choice for a comedy, the format probably can't sustain much more than this.

The Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show is believable and simple - had it existed, it may have retained the mundanity of watching Crufts. It is such simple subjects that create blank slates for hilarious focal points.The main reason why this comedy works is the fact that Guest and Levy use different levels of humour - the old jokes (the Shih Tzu and why you shouldn't mess with its name, the blonde bimbo marrying the man wth one foot in the grave, the Priscilla - esque gay couple), and the downright banal (Harlan Pepper's affinity for ventriloquism, Gerry and Cookie's terrier songs). As well as this, the old theory that what can go wrong, will go wrong is used - and is executed hilariously. Gerry and Cookie are checked into a utility closet, while the pretentious Hamilton and Meg Swan's Weimaraner leaps at a judge. It can be said that this formula has been overused and that it doesn't take comic geniuses to invent such scenarios. However, it is the reactions of the people that make the movie, and some top - class comic timing from actors whom I never would have recognized as comedians.If the premise of outright hilarious jokes doesn't sway you, then watch this movie for the little things, such as the dogs' reactions to the whole show (as expected, they are much less concerned than their owners.)

In this case, the satire has very effectively made its pointed criticism about a particular annual winter USA-Network special presentation of the showy Westminster Dog Show.  At such multi-day judging events all the range of pure breeds of registered dogs are primped and psyched as can be motivated.  All the people who annually produce, direct and compete in that show are unveiled by this movie to be a motley crew of neurotics whose dogs have learned to ignore them for the most part and just go along for the ride.  Such extravaganza television coverage is generally far from reality. Say to yourself it's only a pet show movie, it's only a movie ! ! !  This film conveys the message that outward appearances can be so divergent, especially in such a P-C (politically correct) culture.  I did expect some sort of displaying scene like one in 101 DALMATIANS where the owners resemble the chosen breed of dog they pamper but other wildly diverse set-ups make BEST IN SHOW move into a quick flourish of satiric hilarity.  The best performance is the fish out of water commentator played by Fred Willard; anyone who's tired from Joe Garagialo's year-in year-out retreaded remarks for the two-part Westminster competition on cable TV will catch the film's message.

Christopher Guest once again has proved to be a man for all seasons in this comedy, as he is the film's writer, director and star.  All films generally contain an element of ad lib, or improvisation, but rare is the movie that relies solely on the improv skills of it's actors as they work without a script.  As usual, Guest pulls it off.  Particularly impressive are Fred Willard, who steals the show, and Parker Posey, who performs wonderfully (considering she is the only cast member without an improv background). Rather than providing even a rudimentary synopsis of the film (which should be already posted above), I'll just say that this movie is laugh-out-loud funny with strong performances and great editing.  It is not, however, without it's share of problems... For starters, the documentary format of the film breaks down after a while and the second half of the movie watches more like a documentary/feature hybrid.  We saw the exact same thing occur in Guffman, and while it's more of an inconsistency than a problem, per se, I though it was worth mentioning.  My main beef with the film was that in no way does it stray from the same formula utilized in Guffman.  At the heart of each movie is an event of some sort.  In guffman, it's a town play, in Best in Show, a dog show.  In each, we see the characters in preparation for the event, the event itself and the aftermath.  Even the characters were exactly the same -- Eugene Levy's dim-witted Gerry Fleck and Fred Willard's obnoxious Buck Laughlin are just a little too reminiscent of Dr. Alan Pearl and Ron Albertson (respectively).  While I enjoyed the movie, it would have been nice to see Guest take a departure from what, by now, must be a very comfortable formula for him and co-writer Levy.  Risk taking is always appreciated.  Finally, I don't think that Best in Show was as successful as Guffman for one main reason  Guest spends much more time on-screen in Guffman, and consequently, his Corky St. Clair carries the film.  Less on-screen time and a less interesting character in his Harlan Pepper doesn't hurt the film, but makes it weaker by comparison.

Christopher Guest, who practically created the mockumentry genre with the script for This is Spinal Tap (1984), directs here and co-wrote the film's screenplay with Eugene Levy, who along with Guest is also in the cast.  The dogs appear to be normal, but the owners are an odd yet merry bunch.  Out of the characters, my favorite one is Buck Laughlin, the show's t.v. clueless announcer who is played by Fred Willard.  Willard supplies the film with some outrageous one-liners like for example - He went after her like she was made out of ham. and suggests the bloodhound could be dressed up like Sherlock Holmes.

Although it is done in the same improvisational style of Spinal Tap, it doesn't hide in the shadows of Christopher Guest's masterpiece, it charges out, paints itself day-glo orange and runs about waving its arms around.  Okay, despite the tortured metaphor, the point is that this film forces you to seriously consider which is the better movie. 'Best In Show' is an American comedy done by people who get British humour, which means that we get the best of both worlds.The humour is generally dry and understated and scores its points when the audience finds itself saying I know people like that. To make it work, it needs strong performances and writing and Best In Show has both throughout. I particularly loved the yuppie couple - they study law, they met at Starbucks, they go to therapy, they're obsessed with labels and are abusive to shop attendants and cleaning ladies. Part of the delight is in spotting the little details, like the fact they've brought their Palm Pilots to the dog show. The whole film is full of brilliant little details - I'd go over the word limits describing them all.Thus far I haven't mentioned the dogs, which are obviously a crucial part of proceedings, not so much for what they do but for how the humans interact with them. The way people project their own attitudes onto their dogs is priceless. The one time we see a dog act like a dog - jumping up on a person - everyone sees it as an absolute disaster. The dogs are matched to the people perfectly. Overall, this is another top-shelf mockumentary from Christopher Guest that, IMHO, is marginally better than Spinal Tap. As Homer Simpson would say... mmm... sacrilicious. "},{"Title":"Hilarious!","Date":"29 May 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  I enjoyed every minute of this film.

Christopher Guest does a remarkable job directing this cast of misfit characters.  The plot seems rather simple and even childish, but the cream of this film lies in the characters, not the plot.  Each one perfectly contrasts the others and provides his or her own moments of hilarity, which come from clever humor rather than the expected slapstick comedy.

Bad pun.)","Date":"18 May 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"    Dog shows are weird. People parade their dogs, pampered to look like artificial dummies, around a track and then a judge picks the `best' one. Under what criteria, we'll never know, but Christopher Guest's mockumentary offers some hilarious insight.The movie follows a bunch of characters. There's Meg & Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey & Michael Hitchcock), a couple who adore their dog but the dog goes through a puberty-type stage. There's the Flecks (Eugene Levy & Catherine O'Hara). Gerry was born with two left feet and Cookie has a reputation of sleeping around (with everyone) when she was younger. There's Scott and Stefan (John Micheal Higgins & Michael McKean), a gay couple who adore their twin Shih-Tzus. The Cabots (Jennifer Coolidge & Patrick Crenshaw), a thinly veiled parody of Anna Nicole Smith and her old man husband. She claims she didn't marry him for the money, but soon has a relationship with her dog's trainer, Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch). The last contestant we meet is lonely bait shop owner Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest) and his blood hound. The show is commentated by the hilariously inept Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard).Best In Show is a funny movie. The jokes are mostly smart variations on low-brow. I enjoy a low-brow comedy once in a while, don't get me wrong. The jokes mostly hit home, but I've seen it happen too often that the movie relies on sexual humor (which isn't always that funny anyway) to try and make it funny. My favorite characters were Levy's Gerry and Posey's Meg (and of course Fred Willard).All the actors do a very nice job. This is a very strong cast that doesn't rely on familiar names, however. You've seen these actors before but you probably can't put a name to their face. The highlight is Fred Willard. He gives a great performance, delivering all his lines with perfect comic timing.Best in Show's script is either very good or very limited. Most of the dialogue seems improvised. However, this is an inordinate amount of dialogue to improvise! The script is very good anyway, with some great dialogue and lines. However, as I pointed out earlier, there is too much Farrelly-type sexual humor to make this movie a total hoot. I enjoyed Best In Show. It's got some great jokes, good performances and an excellent script, but the problem of the sex jokes never goes away. I was expecting more than this from the ecstatic reviews I got on the Internet, but this is still an above-average comedy. 7/10  "},{"Title":"very enjoyable comedy","Date":"13 May 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Comedies come in many different shapes and forms.  Some, like Eddie Murphy vehicles, feature a main character who is demonstrably more intelligent than any once else around him, so we, in the audience, get to feel superior right along with him.  We actually derive comic pleasure out of flaunting that superiority.  Another type of comedy is one in which the audience is made to feel superior to EVERYONE on screen.  This is the category into which Christopher Guest's clever and zany mockumentaries, `Waiting for Guffman' and now `Best of Show,' belong. So how does Guest manage to pull off this delicate high wire act of making us feel better than the characters on screen yet not having the movie slide over into cruelty and sadism?  Quite simply, he makes us see ourselves in the characters at the very same time we are laughing at them.  As a shrewd observer of human nature, Guest casts a scathing, yet at the same time utterly affectionate, eye on the bizarre rituals of small town Middle America.  In the case of `Best in Show,' Guest opens up to us the strange milieu of dog show competitions and the people involved in them.  As in `Waiting For Guffman,' he has assembled a cast of lovably eccentric characters to both act out the little dramas of their lives and address the audience directly in the form of mock interviews.  There is no point in reiterating the specifics of the many colorful characters whose lives we follow in the course of the film.  Those you can check out for yourself.  Suffice it to say that Guest makes us see many of our own obsessions, peculiarities and insecurities reflected in these people.  True, competitive dog shows may not be our own particular cup of tea, but we all fixate on SOMETHING that the rest of the world seems ignorantly unwilling to understand, something we may hide from our fellow men simply because they will not `get it.'  `Best in Show' lets us laugh at ourselves without our having to reveal our own personal sore spot.The large and superb cast is called upon to hit just the right comic note, ranging from subtle pathos to over-the-top absurdity &#150; and it is a challenge the actors meet with flying colors.  Perhaps to demonstrate his egalitarian spirit, Guest gives some of his funniest bits to Fred Willard as a show announcer who has not a clue as to the finer points of the competition.  As the one person not initiated into the mysteries of the proceedings, Willard's character seems more out of touch than the eccentrics who get it all.On the laugh meter, `Best of Show' doesn't rate quite as high as `Waiting For Guffman.'  But for its moments of homespun cleverness and charm, it is definitely a comedy well worth checking out for yourself.  `Best in Show' indeed!

The movie is a mock-umentary; that is, it's staged as if it is a documentary complete with interviews with people living their real lives.  In writing this review, I found myself grappling with the task of defining a mockumentary.  This is my best effort In standard movies, we know that the people on the screen are actors playing characters.  In a documentary, we know that the people are real people, not actors or characters.  A mockumentary combines the two the people on the screen are actually actors, but the characters they play are people living real lives.   So the difference is that in real movies, we know that the characters are not real people.  In mockumentaries, we are led to believe that the characters are real people, but we know that they're not.  Perfectly clear, right?So why is a mockumentary funny?  Surely we can laugh at the real people around us, but we may do so cautiously for fear of hurting their feelings.  A mockumentary is enjoyable because it lets us off the hook; we can freely laugh at these real people, because we know they're actually not real people, but merely portraying real people with all of their shortcomings.Although the premise may be complicated, the joke isn't.  Best in Show simply displays the foibles of several types of people when they are placed into an artificial situation.  Literally every scene delivers a healthy giggle at the least, all the way up to true belly laughs. The show is in reality a McGuffin that lets us observe human silliness.  There is the striving, hard-nosed young woman who has chosen winning dog shows as her life's work.  There is the decent, sweet-hearted country boy who thinks he may be smarter than he really is, but if he isn't, that'll be okay with him.  There is the thirty-something couple who place great and equal value on designer catalogues and dog toys.  There is the middle-aged couple who are at once dim bulbs but who also have a lot of love for each other, awkward though it may seem.  And there are the two outwardly gay men who know how to work together as a caring couple, and who aren't afraid to be their own goofy selves in public simply to enjoy their lives.We also meet the show's broadcast host, who is a perfect portrayal of every media type who exudes enthusiasm but does so only because it's his job; he actually has no clue as to what is going on, nor does he care.  And he has a trusty color commentator who is a dog show expert; we know he's an expert because he has a British accent.Much of the comedy has nothing to do with the show.   Catherine O'Hara's past love life surfaces consistently, much to her loving but perplexed husband's dismay.  Ed Begley, Jr., as the manager of the hotel where the contestants are staying, cares so much about his clients that he will do anything to keep them from not having a room.  Larry Davis has a small role as a man whose job it is to talk down people who have climbed tall buildings; we get to see him in action and understand why his success rate is on the smallish side.   The heart of this comedy is the fact that while all of these folks may fail to measure up in one way or another, we know that they're not bad people; they just act the way we all do.  Sometimes our hearts and emotions get in the way of actually doing something important.    Best in Show warms because that while we may fear looking silly, we innately know it's not a bad thing.  While we fail most of the time and can look foolish while we're at it, at least we tried and did so with good intentions.  Have you ever been at a party or convention and attempted making small talk with a group of people you didn't know and didn't care about, and make it sound meaningful?  You'll have plenty of opportunities to laugh at yourself in this movie.A final note the winner of the show was the only person who really looked like they were walking their dog.

Its stylistic acting (like Guffman) and a cast including many of the same actors are a tribute to Christopher Guest and his direction.Guest himself provides the greatest acting contribution to the film in his portrayal of Harlan Pepper, a very human yet highly comedic character. Eugene Levy and Fred Willard deserve mention; the rest of the acting was on par, but not much more.  Eugene Levy, the perennial character actor, plays a role that we've seen a variation of on other occasions, but plays it well with quirks that I've not seen him play.Joseph T. Garrity and Monique Prudhomme (the production designer and costume designer respectively) were integral in the mood of the film as it looked like a documentary (thank you Garrity) and the costumes were comic, but realistic (thank you Prudhomme).One thing that has always bothered me about film was the notion of a continuity error and there is one that I could not overlook in this film. Aside from one major continuity error, the editing was good overall.Now I come to the thing that bothered me most about this film; admittedly, it is something that should not have bothered me my expectations.  I expected to walk into the movie house and not stop laughing until I came out much like I did when I saw Waiting for Guffman; however, I didn't find it nearly as funny.  Perhaps that is because I work in the theatre, perhaps because I've never owned a dog.  Consider this a warning, though.  Don't go into the theatre expecting to see a sequel of Waiting for Guffman, as I've read many times, expect to see a movie in a similar style on completely different subject matter with completely different characters.Also bothersome, was the depth (or lack thereof) of most of the characters. I found most of them to be caricatures rather than human beings.  However, I heard the woman behind me say that she liked all of the characters as people, so perhaps it's only because I haven't ever known anyone who has participated in a dog show.In order to not end this review on a down note, I'd like to point out that I do recommend this film to anyone.  Perhaps dog owners will appreciate it more, but it is a film that you should see.

This is satire of our times at its finest.  Besides the serious belly laughs provided by Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard and Eugene Levy, there are the more subtle characters like Ed Begley, as the tolerant hotel manager and Bob Balaban and Don Lake as the self-serious heads of the dogshow, who provide surrealistic views of the actual people who make an event like this happen.And then there are the dogs, each one a real champion in his own way. It truly is hard to pick just one to route for.  I especially liked Hubert, the bloodhound, the shitzu and, of course, little Winky, the terrier.  One charming part of this film is that the love of the owners for their dogs really came through.  Especially poignant was Guest's character, coming from a rural Southern area to the show in Philadelphia, because of pride and belief in his Hubert.

"},{"Title":"Will The Shih Tzus And The Weimaraner Come Forward, Please...","Date":"24 October 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  	Writer/director Christopher Guest takes a look at the relationship between Man and that most loyal of beasts, the dog, in `Best In Show,' a humorous satire presented in the same `mock documentary' style as Rob Reiner's `This Is Spinal Tap.'  It's a keen observation of human nature, as it is much more about the owners and handlers than about the dogs themselves, and much as David Byrne did with `True Stories,' Guest presents a diverse community united by a single, common thread, that being their love for their dogs, and aspirations of winning the blue ribbon in the upcoming competition that will go to the top dog overall, the Best In Show.  Through a series of interviews and memorable scenes, we are introduced to the owners and their beloved canines who will soon square off in the arena at the world class Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia.  We get to know a bit about each of the participants, so we know just who they are and where they come from.  Guest has assembled a terrific ensemble cast, who bring it all to life by creating a rich tapestry of characters culled from a true cross section of Americana  Good ol' boy Harlan Pepper (Guest), with his Bloodhound, `Hubert', from Pine Nut, North Carolina; a somewhat neurotic young couple from Illinois, Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), members of the `Starbucks' set with their Weimaraner, `Beatrice;' Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), a couple who could be anybody's next door neighbors, with their Norwich Terrier, `Winky', from Fern City, Florida;  Leslie and Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw and Jennifer Coolidge) a wealthy couple who have a Standard Poodle, `Rhapsody In White', entrusted to the care of professional handler Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch); and finally, another couple, Scott Donlan and Stefan Vanderhoof (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean), with their precious Shih Tzus, `Miss Agnes.' 	This is a highly entertaining, funny movie, filled with wry, subtle humor that is delivered straight and never played for laughs, which makes it believable and real, and all the more hilarious.  This is quite a group of characters, eclectic to say the least, and they're all real people.  You're bound to run into someone you know among them.  The dialogue is sharp, and rife with dry wit.  And for anyone who's ever watched any kind of sporting event on television, you'll appreciate the parody of the so-called `color commentator,' in this case a guy named Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), that is dead on the money.  His comments during an interview to a nonplused Dr. Millbank (Bob Balaban) about Columbus landing at Plymouth Rock will have you on the floor.  There is so much here you can relate to, and it's all done in such good fun.   	Rounding out the outstanding supporting cast are Don Lake (Graham Chissolm), Jim Piddock (Trevor Beckwith), Ed Begley, Jr. (Hotel manager), Linda Kash (Fay Berman), Larry Miller (Max Berman) and Don S. Davis (Best In Show Judge).  The performances here are good all around, with especially notable turns by O'Hara, Levy, Guest, Lynch and Willard.  Written by Guest and Levy, `Best In Show' works so well because it holds up a mirror and reflects the lives we all lead in one way or another.  As we watch, we realize that even as we are laughing at all of these characters and situations, at the same time we're laughing at ourselves as well; because there's more than a little bit of each one of us in there somewhere.  And it reminds us that when things seem to be getting too serious, it's time to pick up that mirror and take a good look; and thanks to the frame of reference that a movie like this provides, you just may find something to laugh about, and be able to discover the `Best In Show' in your own life.  I rate this one 9/10.

It was with that anticipation that I went to see Best in Show, which is set around the fictional Mayflower Kennel Club dog show in Philadelphia.I thought that the first half of the movie, where the characters and the dogs are introduced was just downright boring.  I think that the storyline with Christopher Guest (as Harlan Pepper) and his bloodhound was particularly uninteresting.  I think that there were probably too many characters to really develop a story for each and you don't get too involved with them.  I think the story should have been about two of the dogs and their owners (I probably would have chosen the gay Shih-Tzu owners and the ultra-yuppie Weimaraner owners to focus on, they had the most potential).Fred Willard as Buck Laughlin steals the movie as the TV announcer who obviously gets assigned the dog show because he's annoyed somebody at the network.  He knows nothing about dogs and dog shows and doesn't hesitate to ask his sophisticated and knowledgeable British co-host the most stupid and embarrassing of questions.  Buck just roles off one hilarious one-liner after another.  It finally got to the point where the audience I watched the movie with laughed before he opened his mouth because they knew he was going to say something very funny.  This is Fred Willard's finest moment in a long career.Overall, Best in Show is OK, but not that great.

Oh, there's one more thing, I got a full bred Keeshond for my son last year, and the dog is a major irritant in my life right now. I went to Best In Show to laugh at dog people, and all I can say is MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. I happen to think Christopher Guest is a brilliant filmmaker. In Best In Show, he has captured the absurd and oddly compelling pageantry of dog shows. And this is more than just a `dog owners tend to look like their dog breed' chuckle, this is an outrageous lampoon of the people who treat their pets better than people. Best In Show is a mockumentary of a dog show, similar to the Westminster Kennel Club competition that's become must-see-TV in our house every February. In the grandly funny style of This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman, we watch interviews with different dog owners and trainers and see glimpses into their odd little lives. Of course, it all leads up to the dog show, with the requisite gamesmanship, tension and hilarity, as we follow what goes on behind the scenes and also hear the broadcast commentary. My favorite character is Fred Willard's Buck Laughlin, a former pro-athlete (think Joe Garagiola) who provides clueless and irreverent commentary during the broadcast. He goes so far as to suggest the bloodhound should wear as Sherlock Holmes type hat and pipe! Christopher Guest writes, directs and stars (Harlan Pepper, bloodhound owner) in this masterful comedy. His Spinal Tap buddy, Michael McKean (Stefan Vanderhoof), teams up with John Michael Higgins (Scott Donlan) to provide a lot of laughs as a single sex couple in love with their Shih Tzu. They even have a disparaging remark about keeshonds. I was the only one in the theater laughing really hard about that one, but for the most part, a large and widely diverse audience at the cinema on a Sunday night laughed throughout the film. Best in Show is rated PG-13 for language and sex-related material. And, there's a bit more involved with that than a pug humping away on a man's leg, though there's just something funny about that. And, there's a lot that's funny about Best In Show. The laughs come from material that's sophomoric and from material that's sophisticated. The important part is, the laughs keep on coming!

I could mention each funny thing about each character and that would be it. Each actor was given his or her outline, I assume, and then told to ad-lib based on the one thing written for each persona.

The best example of this, and where Best at Show departs, is the tense hidden love of Steve, the Pharmacist, for Corky. Eluded to only in passing comments, some exceptional cheering and a quick glance of the eyes, it never really comes out and nails it on the head with a big HELLO AUDIENCE - STEVE IS GAY. But then there is Best at Show which sets it up with road signs that the rich lady and her trainer (their names escape me) are hiding a little something, and then lets it rip on national television. Sure I laughed, but still wanted something a little more.The rest of the movie pretty much repeats the same point. Other than that the shit-su should have won.

The last time I laughed so much, it had to be Galaxy Quest, but the jokes then were often about Star Trek and other space shows, not just the situation itself. The laughter in the audience was so different, here, though. Much stronger, probably the way Airplane was in the theaters. Made it hard to follow the movie, so many people kept laughing, you missed the next lines. A good reason to see it again.I was a fan of SCTV about 20 years ago, even though the show was uneven, but I loved the way Catherine O'Hara acted, and she's quite good here. So is Eugene Levy.If you don't know the plot, it's about dog show contestants. We follow six couples as they prepare to leave home for the Mayflower dog show in Philadelphia, and then we watch them in the competition. We finally see the winner after the show has long gone, about a year later. The style is mock documentary, even though we never see who's doing the documentary. It's just the style.Wish it had been longer, guess it was about 90 minutes. It never slowed down, even though there are clearly sections where they don't go for sustained laughs, especially for the guy who lives in a town called Pinenut.The film is remarkably kind to strange people, though it uses them for laughs. It nevers flips over the edge into cruelty. For instance, there's a chesty woman who has a lot to do with Anna Nicole Smith, who has married a real, real old geezer for the money. The geezer is hilarious, even though he never says a word. If he'd said any lines, it would have been at the expense of good taste, I expect. Instead, we simply are invited to imagine what he is like.This is the best movie of its kind. Of course, I've never seen a movie about dog shows. I'll go see it again very soon, at least to start finding all the other stuff I didn't hear over the laughter. I don't recall anything anybody in the movie said, though, which means I doubt it will have the influence of Caddyshack or Airplane. Still, the flick is funny on its own terms.By the way, it gets the laughs without making fun of the idea of dog shows. People in the audience loved the dogs, so the jokes didn't alienate them by questioning the validity of the dog show itself.I saw this in a small Berkeley theater. Hope it gets picked up by the large megaplexes.Woof! Woof! Woof!

Guest, along with co-writer Eugene Levy, populates the world of dog shows with identifiable people and while they often draw caricatures (particularly a married couple, played by Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey, who project their fears, hostilities and parenting efforts upon their Weimariner; and Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins as an over-the-top gay couple), the ensemble has such affection for the characters you're happy to accept them for who they are. This is because the improvisational aspect of the dialog makes everyone seem real; you feel as if you know and sympathize with them as they struggle to succeed, as in the case of Levy and the sublime Catherine O'Hara, playing a couple who find they can't afford a hotel room and are put up in a utility closet by the well-meaning hotel manager (wonderfully played by Ed Begley, Jr.). Even those meant to be identified as villians (dog handler Jane Lynch and owner Jennifer Coolidge) understand their characters so well it's impossible not to like them. The film is immensely entertaining and seems to fly by, so much so that it belies its reasonable ninety minute run time.

It's a bit more all-audiences than Spinal Tap, while completely skipping the emotional hooks of A Mighty Wind or Waiting For Guffman, but still delivers enough legit snickers to validate a simple retirement as late-night cable network filler. The straight-ahead plot never shows much interest in progressing beyond simple character-driven adventure, and while each member of the cast is good for a smart punchline or two, the roles themselves are universally shallow, narrow caricatures.

When you consider that the majority of the film is improvisational, with the characters given a basic structure from which to work and then allowed to go where their creativity takes them you get a real appreciation of just what a good ensemble cast can capture/create.This particular outing takes on the world of dog shows and follows the exploits of various dog owners to the Best In Show finals. It is a stitch! There is something here for everybody. Of course the standout is Fred Willard as an obnoxious commentator who really deserved winning the Oscar for supporting actor for which he was nominated. The character study of each dog owner of course sheds infinite light into why they are so obsessed with their dog receiving the top award.The improvisation is top-notch but I would expect nothing less. Catherine O'Hara is generally flawless and here she does not disappoint. She is in RARE form! She and Eugene Levy play off each other quite well. Other cast members that I have seen in Waiting for Guffman as well as A Mighty Wind continue to be consistently creative and funny and I welcome their efforts. While Waiting for Guffman and A Mighty Wind pale in comparison, they too reveal flashes of the genius of Mr. Guest and company.A must for your DVD collection and it gets funnier each time you watch. Just don't watch with serious dog owners or they may be somewhat insulted because Best In Show while empathizing with its subject matter, does not take it as seriously as some obviously do!

We have the homosexual men with a cute girlish dog, the sexy grave-robber woman who eventually leaves her old husband for a lesbian, a yuppie couple who visit a psychologist while convinced their dog has issues, a typical mid-western couple who enter their pet because it is something they always wanted to do, and a typical hunter who rambles on and on about his experiences. The stories of these people and why they entered the dog show are the movie's focus, complete with the end of the movie where their reactions to the dog show are observed.

One of the beauties of films like this is that, aside from having moments of obvious humour, Guest and all the others do such a great job at recreating a slightly off-balance version of reality while making it all really feel like a documentary instead of a comedy. It's this low-key, dry, rather deadpan humour at which this film excels.Everyone does a beautiful job at creating somewhat odd, off-the-wall characters and events while the whole time appearing totally serious, matter-of-fact, and normal. As usual, they take types of people who tend to be a little different anyway, make them subtly more strange and humorous, and present it as if it were normal reality. This subtle humour is present throughout and is simply brilliant and utterly hilarious. I guess some people who found this dull only latch onto the more obvious humour and fail to realize that the entire film is pretty much constant humour.It takes a lot of skill to do something like this and have it be really funny while carefully avoiding the pitfalls of going over the top and being lame and ruining the sense of reality, or being so dry that it doesn't seem like humour at all. This is a perfect example of how this group can expertly traverse this narrow path and succeed almost flawlessly.

A perfect dog show movie for us would probably not appeal to the general public. This movie does a pretty good job of being watchable and funny to the non-dog show people yet being accurate enough to be funny and watchable to those of us who love this world of dogs.I appreciate it that Christopher Guest did his homework and actually educated himself and his actors about dog shows. It was wonderful to see that he actually used good show dogs(champions) and handlers in the movie. I was delighted that I never heard the term grand champion. I Thank him,also, for not making any of the dogs/breeds seem so darling that we see the public demanding puppies leading to a proliferation of puppy mill puppies-For those of you who don't understand that statement,talk to any devoted dalmation breeder/exhibitor.Best in Show is supposed to be entertainment and as such, the characters have to be a little over the top. But, most of us that have shown dogs for any length of time can recognize bits of these characters in exhibitors we've met. Actually, I can thing of some that are even weirder.

Here he not only stars but he also directs and co-writes and shows his talents well.  The story is not really a straight forward affair and those looking for a good narrative have misunderstood this film.

All the couples are hilarious &#150; not always laugh out loud funny, but a more quirky comedy.  The best odd couple is left to the commentators who are a mix of expert and talkative ignorant (the usual real life mix).  The observation is so well observed and very realistic and full of hilarious lines &#150; `how do they get the miniature dogs to be miniature &#150; is their a special miniaturizing process they go through?' etc.The cast are roundly excellent &#150; this is very much an ensemble piece. Writers Guest and Levy are excellent.  Cult queen Parker Posey is excellently stressed with Hitchcock and McKean and Higgins are funny a the OTT gay couple.

Sometimes it's genuinely funny; sometimes there's a subtle humor underneath that's amusing but not laugh-out-loud funny (similar to The Royal Tenenbaums, but not as arty).The one negative comment I'll make is that the movie sets up several quirky characters, and normally we would expect these various characters to play off of one another in a series of mounting chaos, such as The Secret of My Success, or A Fish Called Wanda, or American Pie. No such thing happens -- in fact, the main characters barely meet at all, staying boxed neatly in their own subplots.There are better comedies out there, but if you see yourself perusing the 1980s comedies in the video store, about to take a wild chance on something you've never heard of, get this instead.Who should see this film-- dog lovers of all types-- comedy movie fans who aren't expecting Animal House humor-- anyone who wants to see more of Eugene Levy, who played Jim's Dad in the film American PieI'll give Best in Show a 6 out of 10.

It was funny in spots, but simple funniness isn't enough by itself for me.This is a little different. As with `Tap' and Guffman' the central device is a show bracketed by a documentary. But here, there is a greater spectrum of realities. Each character (or character pair) creates their own reality which varies more widely than the prior film, plus there is anchor of `real' reality. The goofy thing is that the real reality is the dogs and the non-featured other dog owners. A strange anchor. As we move through the scenes, we get buffeted by the discontinuous, unrelated worlds like walking from one theater to another in a multiplex.What makes this interesting for me is Guest's character. He creates a reality that is between Burton's PeeWee and something Sean Penn would do, say his Jazz Banjoist. Very multilayered. Very intelligent. Just the right ingredients a telepathic dog; a dummy; A 200 year old log cabin filled with beach balls; two phantom hills that aren't (or rather, are); nuts; flies; counties.But to get to that, you have to wade through an hour of uninspired improv two ordinary gay guys; two anal lawyers and so on.It puzzles me why Guest works with Levy. Guest's humor draws you in -- he's personal, human, lightly dark. Levy is juvenile, strutting, cynical.Supposedly, this is the mix from 60 hours of material.

I think it got about one laugh, and a couple of smiles throughout, and the rest of the time i was in pain.If you think the idea of someone reciting a line, sometimes saying something ever so slightly odd, in a matter of fact and totally deadpan way is enough for a supposed comedy, well, you may like it, but i wouldn't class it as humorous in the slightest when done repeatedly for an entire movie. Some scenes don't even have this slight blessing, and consist of the characters just doing something intensly stupid and annoying, with that trait presumably something to find humour in.You have been warned.

It's not that the dog shows themselves are made fun of in Best in Show, it's the people who's entire lives revolve around preening and training their dogs to be show participants.  The two characters that stand out as exceptional performances are the oafish announcer, and the guy with, well ... two left feet. Literally! The dogs themselves are great, and probably are overlooked in most reviews.

Eugene Levy is apparently not funny enough for Guest - he wears buck teeth and has two left feet.  In the process of getting his dog to the show, the character discovers that his wife (Catherine O'Hara) is the regional slut - not exactly a laugh a minute!

But that is not really what Christopher Guest has ever done.I watched this to remind myself what I love about this style of film. The characters develop naturally, by shedding layers of pretense when they don't know we are watching and suddenly pulling themselves together in a vain attempt to convince the viewer that we just caught them at a bad moment. It's a brilliant way to show us the lives of people on a mission. When you allow yourself to forget that you are watching a movie, and plunge into the documentation of these people's lives, you experience the sheer joy of being in on the joke, through the eyes of the camera crew. The behind the scenes workers who toil away on big budget films, and get to see the reality behind the surreal world of personas and personalities. Guest takes us deep into the lives of the ordinary person, who is trying to live an extraordinary life. This time, they do it through the dogs they own, or show.They have dreams, and delusions, but the one thing you feel with Guest, that I appreciate now more than ever, is that he genuinely enjoys the human condition. He likes people. He cares about his audience, and he is in on the joke with us. We are not the butt of the joke, and we are never insulted for loving Dog Shows, Community Theater, or even the Rock Stars in a giant arena. Everybody loves a show, or to be a part of the show. NOT everybody gets to be a big star. To be the winner. To be noticed for what they feel is their unique gift or talent. Rather than exploit that, and mock it in a cruel and unfunny fashion, Guest reminds us that within our little circle, and in our own ways, we can all feel like stars. And it nobody has to get hurt in the process. I watched this film, in part, to recover from what I felt was an abysmal failure to make a Mockumentary style film about writers. Authors Anonymous. It fails where Guest shines. There are people acting their hearts out in old citrus warehouses, and others are packing up their RV's to head out to another dog show. These life stories, and their sometimes absurd details, make for hopeful films that salute the human spirit. The spirit of competition is a theme Guest tackles with grace, and a divine objective everyone can be a star sensibility that pays homage to our desire to feel special, and rewards it at times, in the most delightful fashion. The underdog. That is what he brings us time and again, in new forms. This time, with actual dogs in the mix! Mock umentary should mean mocking the style of the documentary film Not mocking the people who are the subject of the film Even when the film is about insufferable boobs. We learn enough about them to begin to understand what makes them tick, what holds them together, and what causes them to come unglued. We end up caring. Dog Shows are silly, but the people are far more complex. Dog shows are filled with pretentious snobs, in real life Easy prey. Not so easy to make a movie that works, much less can make us root for these people on any level, but he did it again. And is it ever fun to watch.

The comedy just flows so nicely, the production work put into the dog show itself, the cast of remarkable characters with their own hilarious quirks, and it's an animal movie! I love Eugene Levy's ridiculous character as a bucktoothed, double-left-foot-having, concerned husband through the whole film as he meets past lovers of his wife, Cookie (O'Hara). The dogs matched all of the owners really well, and I loved Parker Posey's meltdowns as her and her yuppie husband try and perform new age healing on their dogs' mental state in every scene that the dog loses it. And Scott & Stefan (John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean) were hilarious as a feng shui-obsessed gay couple.There's very little that I don't like about this film. I took off a point because it is, after all, another of Guest's improv comedies, so it's like redoing a past movie or something, replacing the past plot with this one. But this is actually a movie to buy instead of rent, even though its indie culture behind the actors and everything may not be the most obviously appealing.

Spinal Tap relied heavily on being around during that time period and knowing a bit about the subject matter.

And that's people who love dogs and are willing to do whatever it takes to get that coveted blue ribbon and ultimately, the gold cup. For those who are familiar with this sport, and especially those who have participated in showing dogs, this is one of the funniest movies around. Sure, there are a lot of continuity errors, and in fact a few factual errors when showing a dog, such as all small breeds are brought to a table, and when Winky is in the final round he is not brought up to the table, but the rest of the movie is so good one tends to overlook these small things. Then we break it down to specific people and breeds (though some think the 2 are interchangeable or indistinguishable). There are the terrier people, and Cookie (O'Hara) and Gerry (Levy) are perfect as the human low-end (and I mean no disrespect here) of the dog-show circuit but who manage to have themselves a great dog. Then we have the yuppie couple, played so well by Posey and Hitchcock, whose lives are so wrapped around what their precious dog is thinking they actually make it worse not only for themselves but for the dog. Good acting also by this particular dog to be able to just lie around or stand without looking at all the chaos going on around her (must be an obedience champion as well). Then we have Guest as the owner of a Bloodhound, and his character was right on the money, even down to the way he talks to the hound. You talk differently to different breeds. (Hard to explain, but if you have never been to a dog show, go to one. Just remember that before a dog is shown the handlers and owners are very busy and do not have time to talk, and whatever you do, do not talk to them in front of a ring, or worse, try to pet the dog.) Of course there are the rich owners who hire the very best handlers and hardly even notice their dogs, other than as a means to an end (breeding). And let it be known that Coolidge is probably one of our most under-rated actresses around. That in every scene she is eating is a running gag that works. And of course, no dog show would be complete without the gay couple and how the handler gets all testy when the co-owner/partner is bothering him. What I liked a lot about this movie was that not only was it about a sport I used to participate in, but we got a decent background story on all the characters, dogs included. And the color commentary done by Willard has to be some of the funniest stuff around. That Piddock could keep a straight face was amazing since I read that there was a lot of ad-libbing going on. I also liked the fact that real winners were used as well as real handlers and owners used not only in the movie, but were there to make sure that what we saw was what actually occurs, right down to the clothing a handler wears (again, back to the type of breed and the people who own/handle them).

The lesbian couple who show their manicured poodle, White Rapsody. The gay couple who are way out of the closet.It's well directed by Christopher Guest, has sometimes extremely amusing dialog and situations written by Guest and Eugene Levy, and is acted to perfection. It's done quietly though and hardly seems scripted at all, a kind of comedy verite in which performers sometimes speak directly to the camera while evidently being interviewed. There's a quiet, semi-documentary feel to the film.I can't go through the whole thing without spoiling some of the gags but I want -- no, I NEED -- to mention specifically some of the exchanges between the two commentators we see, probably speaking on the radio. Fred Willard and Jim Piddock play roles we're all familiar with from talk shows. Willard takes the part of the talk-show host, asking naive questions and making what he thinks are amusing comments, taking the role of the audience. Piddock, with a serious mien and Brit accent, is the expert who supplies precise knowledge and answers the host's dumb questions.The dogs are trotted out one by one to be examined. One of the dogs is hoisted onto a table and examined manually by the judge. Willard The judge here is Eddie Franklin. Piddock I believe that's Edie Franklin, Buck. Willard Oh, yeah. It's a woman alright. What's she doing now, Trevor? Piddock I believe she's examining the animal's testicular area. Willard Oh, Wow! I'd hate to go out on a date with Edie! Can you imagine?

Eugene Levy has two left feet. But that's nothing compared to the many comic scenes that connect so squarely. It all ends happily in a couple of filmic postscripts. At the beginning we see the Yuppie couple complaining that their child is interfering with their sex lives, and the camera shows us their bored Weimerener. By the end, the couple tell their counselor that their sex lives are now terrific and the dog isn't a bother at all. She likes to watch.

The two fear Beatrice will never forgive them.The camera pulls back to reveal Beatrice is a Weimaraner, lying on her own miniature coach and clearly overwhelmed by something, whether the sight of her two owners having sex or just living with them in general. Thus begins Best In Show, a free-wheeling comedy about dogs and the people who exhibit them at a Westminster-style national competition.While a lot of Saturday Night Live and Second City-type comedy actors got their start in improvisational theater, former National Lampoon Lemming Christopher Guest has preserved this early 1970s do-it-yourself aesthetic on screen while others settle for the comfort of a finished script. What his films lack in plot they make up for in character. Best In Show can take patience; it's more sneaky-funny than funny-funny, which was the case with the previous improv-comedies Guest was involved in, This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting For Guffman. Best In Show isn't as great as Spinal Tap but it may have the most lived-in feeling of any of his films. There's a lot of lines that sound bare in isolation but are comedy gold in contextHe went after her like she was made of ham. What are you, a wizard, a genius? I woke up, I was so glad. Someone's still a little jealous...How many years ago did he poke me? She looks like a cocktail waitress on an oil rig. No, that's a bear in a bee costume. We both have so much in common...We both love soup. Getting the smell of cumin and charcoal out of the drapes was a chore onto itself. A little secret of the trade They all jump.There are punch lines and outrageous situations, but it's the characterizations that make this film special, even for people who think they know the Guest ideal from his earlier films. Leading the charge is John Michael Higgins and Michael McKean as a gay couple with a prize Shih Tzu they lavish excess love upon. The camp value of the two is high; yet they have so much depth and kookiness you wind up enjoying their company even when Higgins' Scott character isn't cutting up with some outrageous remark about sausage membranes. The other characters present us with various levels of subtlety and outrageousness, but Higgins and McKean give us both.Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara meanwhile give the film much of its heart as a financially-strapped couple who believe their Norwich Terrier can win the big prize, even if they have to live in a janitor's closet to make it happen. Fred Willard is the skunk at the picnic as an ex-baseball-player TV commentator who clearly took too many fastballs to the head. Guest himself ironically plays the least interesting character, a Carolina bloodhound man with a side interest in ventriloquism. But like all the other gifted actors on display, he brings something to the party.A cult film that deserves its cult, Best In Show is a joy for dog-lovers and film-lovers alike.

They range from quietly funny (sometimes silence and expressions can be funnier than blatant jokes - see the trophy wife in this case) to so strange that you can't help laughing out of sheer huh? factor.  The cast brings these to life in a perfect manner.  For most of them, I couldn't have picked a better cast (sure, it's the same cast as in all of Guest's movies, but that doesn't matter).The plot is a little disjointed, having been edited down from 60 hours of footage, but holds its own, especially in the latter half of the film at the actual dog show.  I am glad, however, that they kept in some little touches that add to the characters' development.But what makes this movie so legendary is that the characters contained within do exist in society.  I love it!  They may be stereotypes in some cases, but what the hey...see this film. NOW.

Filled with mainly the same cast as Guffman, Best in Show tells of the quirky characters who participate in the dog show circuit and of their different dogs. The film basically follows, documentary-style, five different groups of people before one of American's oldest dog shows, during the show, and six months after the show. There is a mismatched couple, the elderly Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw) and his 30-something trophy wife Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge), who go to the show along with their trainer, Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), a dominatrix-dressed lesbian. There are two married yuppies, (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey), who are obsessed with their dog Beatrice, and treat her as if she is their daughter. There are a middle-aged couple (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), who are happily married, but throughout the film, they constantly meet into guys she's been with before, and he has to tortorusly hear all of her sexual activities from the past. There is a gay couple (Michael McKean and John Michael Higgins), who are very proud of their two Shih Tzus, and my personal favorite, Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest), a rambling Southerner who travels with only his Beagle and a ventriloquest doll named Lil' Buddy. One of the funneist characters, however, is Fred Willard's Buck Laughin, a portrait of comedic genius. Willard's whole role was filmed in about one day, but his improv is perfect as a confused announcer, who knows nothing about dog shows. Although I don't think Best in Show is as funny as Guest's Waiting for Guffman, it is still a comic gem with some great performances, some great one-liners, and a very realistic documentary feel. 9/10  "},{"Title":"Loved it from beginning to end","Date":"15 June 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  Maybe I was just in the right mood for a film like this, but I can't remember when I've ever enjoyed a comedy as much as I enjoyed Best of Show.

It's also very convincing, even though all of the characters are eccentric (to say the least).  There are many bright spots here and the laughs come almost nonstop.  My personal favorite had to be Fred Willard as the out-there commentater.  Nearly every one of his lines had me in stitches and his inappropriate baseball comparisons were a hoot.  His character alone, is worth a rental. Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey were also pretty funny as the married lawyer couple with matching braces, although they did start to get annoying about half-way through. Parker Posey has a knack for playing offbeat characters (does she do anything else?) and she was right at home here.  Hitchcock cracked me up in Waiting For Guffman as the councilman who seemed to have a crush on Corky.  He and Posey make a great match.Guest himself has a very amusing part as Harlan Pepper, a backwoods hick who runs a fly shop back home and has had a lifelong ovsession with naming nuts.  His country-boy drawl is terrific and he's probably the most likeable character.  This is the guy I was rooting for to win.Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are also great as the Flecks.  Man, talk about a mismatched couple...This guy was born with two left feet (literally) and doesn't even do anything when other guys hit on his wife, in front of him (!).

His disgruntled son, perhaps mildly autistic, climbs onto the garage roof, clutching the Flecks' prize terrier.

Of course, this same guy is the first of an endless series of ex-lovers that Cookie Fleck runs into, and she doesn't really remember any of them very clearly! A brilliantly funny idea perfectly carried out. Or how about the ancient, toothless, wrinkled-up (but really wealthy) human wreck who is married to the buxom Kristy?

There's the former High School Hottie who's now married to a geeky man, the childless, label-obsessed yuppie couple, the solitary outdoorsman, the young wife of a wealthy old codger (along with her short-haired dog trainer), and the gay couple.What makes this film so funny though is the way it portray's these stereotypes in a completely believable way - almost affectionate, in many cases.  Every ridiculous thing one of the characters does or says - with their dog as an innocent onlooker - seems like the kind of behaviour you'd totally expect to see at a dog show.The biggest laughs come from the commentary team of an all-american style sports announcer, comparing moments in a dog show to parts of a baseball game, and his English, canine academic, foil.The trials of the geeky husband as his blonde wife meets an astonishing number of men from her past is also always good for a chuckle, as is the demented behaviour of the yuppie couple as the pressure builds, while their hound stays completely unflustered.Well worth watching - even if cats are more your bag.

From Scott Donlan's desire to just hold the salami to the discovery of Rhapsody's two mommies, Guest may not win any awards from the gay and lesbian community. Coolidge's portrayal of Sheri Ann Ward Cabot has the look of Ivana Trump on mescaline. Not to be outdone by those that claim DINK's(dual incomes,no kids) have little or no substance, Guest unleashed Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock to put this argument to rest once and for all. I keep trying to put myself in Eugene Levy's two left shoes and imagine what it must be like to discover that your wife has boned most of the miscreants you bump into on your journey to the Mayflower... but I can't.

In an ironically telling touch, the dogs themselves are offered up for what they are--champion animals, first-rate and beautiful. Guest and Levy wisely chose to poke fun not at the canines, majestic animals all, but at their fallible human masters, who are sometimes sweet in their goofiness (like Harlan Pepper, the genial proprietor of a bait-and- tackle-shop and part-time ventriloquist, played with likable sincerity by Guest himself) to downright detestable (Hamilton and Meg Swan, performed with neurotic nastiness by Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey, who project their own hang-ups and frustrations upon the poor creature that is their dog). Other noteworthy performances are given by Michael McKean--and John Michael Higgins in particular--as an uproarious gay couple, proud owners of Shih Tzus named Agnes and Tyrone and all the frou-frou inherent therein; Jennifer Coolidge as Sherri Ann Cabot and her dog handler Christy (a very straight-forward, hilarious performance by Jane Lynch), and their pride-and-joy poodle named 'Butch'; and most especially by Fred Willard as Buck Laughlin, whose side-splitting running commentary of the dog show is matched only by Jim Piddock as Trevor Beckwith, who proffers one of the most brilliant jobs of straightmanship captured on film in recent memory. This film is not for everyone, especially those weaned on such 'comedy' films as 'American Pie' and 'The Water Boy.' Its pacing is slow and smart, and--apparently one of Christopher Guest's chief loves as a filmmaker--background stories and relationships are provided to help flesh out the characters, and to help us better understand their motivations.

The film is shot in a mock-documentary style similar to Waiting for Guffman, that was also created by the comic geniuses Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy.  In that film, much of the same cast, including Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, and Michael McKean, was involved in a small town sesquicentennial history pageant. In Best in Show a variety of well-cast characters are involved with a national dog competition. Guest obviously does not realize that a documentary style can limit the effective material in comedies, which has proved well in this production.Best in Show details the adventures of an assortment of looney characters preparing themselves and their canines for a national dog show. There is Harlan Pepper (Christopher Guest), a fly fishing shop owner from North Carolina who has come north to show his beloved bloodhound, Meg and Hamilton Swan (Parker Posey and Michael Hitchcock), who wish to win the show with their Weimaraner, but are worried because their  pet witnessed them engaging in unusual sex. We also meet a clumsy salesperson named Gerry Fleck (Eugene Levy) who, along with his spouse (Catherine O'Hara) prepares to show his terrier, Winky. There are also two homosexual lovers (Michael McKean and John Michael Higgens), who own a charming Shih Tzu, and an anxious woman named Sherri Ann (Jennifer Coolidge) who works frivolously with her trainer (Jane Lynch), in preparing her champion poodle.The dog show actually just provides a backdrop, or excuse, for the filmmakers to examine a colorful array of eccentric characters. The actual plot, if you can call it that, lacks conflict and needs more focus on the dog show instead of getting into the character's sex lives, psychological problems, family history, and other useless and meaningless points of information. Obviously, much of this material offers some very big laughs, as well as an almost continuous charm throughout the audience, but in-between the hilarious moments, the movie somewhat sags because it has nowhere to fall back on except its bland story-line.Best In Show failed to hold my attention thoroughly and much of its material feels strained and out of place. With a little more zest and verve, we would have had a wickedly funny film here, with some of the most zany characters to hit the big screen in a long time. Instead, however, we receive a bunch of forgettable material laced with occasional amusement and fumes of entertainment. Mockumentary has worked before, and if used with the right material, and be very successful, like in The Blair Witch Project. However in Best in Show, the style only gets in the way of what could have been one of the funniest comedies of the year.

Then he came up with Waiting For Guffman (hunt it down like a rabid wallaby -if you have not seen it). Now Guest turns his visceral eyeballs towards the seemingly innocent lives behind a dog show. Actually, the pomp and stance, behemoth egos, whacko human natures and pathetic clueless lower echelon of intelligence behind the dog show.Chris follows his tried and true MO ; getting comedy/acting talent together on a set, giving them the theme and concept, then rolling the film. Guest is creating not movie kucka, as you may fear, but unique and down right funny stufaamahgawll.Story goes...Philadelphia is hosting a big time doggie show- The Mayflower Kennel Club Show. We lucky viewers get to go behind the scenes and meet the contestants-Guest style.There's dog owner/contestant Harlan Pepper (Baron-legit, not just to get better seating at Emeril's-Christopher Guest ) who's not a bright watted bulb. He dimly recites various nuts of the world and other hit-your-head-against-a-wall dullities till your pleading for another Gore/Bush debate for the excitement of their oratorical deliveries! Harlan's duuulll. Physically, Guest makes him a walking L.L. Bean catalog (though Harlan wouldn't even know what L.L. Bean was- a tropical nut in the vanilla family perhaps?).

Gerry Fleck (Eugene  Caterpillar Brow Levy ) and Cookie Fleck (Catherine Still a Looker O'Hara) are middle-class tack- infested- city hillbilles- with- better home-bumpkins from Florida. Their small odd world revels around their spoiled Terrier, Winky. The Fleck's counterparts ( O'Hara and Levy) happen to be a couple of my all time favorite comedians- enjoy the magic.I should mention this again...Best In Show's script was strictly a storyboard outline- no concrete dialog. The actors ad libbed their lines- bouncing off each other with rapid precision (like Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe 200 miles north of Sydney-about now). I'd like to see Adam Sandler attempt that- well, and actually BE FUNNY.We also get to meet the Swans. Meg (Parker Posey ) and Hamilton (Michael Hitchcock) who are just plane old neurosis filled vials of human phlegm. They are frighteningly identifiable.

Tearjerkingly funny characters!Loving couple Scott (John Michael Higgins) and his lover Stefan (Michael McKean) are true scene stealers. Call them caricatures with soul. What is it about gay males that is just so cool? Sure they redecorate their hotel room for a two night stay, sure they pack fifteen Kimonos for the weekend-who doesn't ...but what is it...Oh, yeah, they too love men. Tall men, short men, manly men with bulging ...Sorry. They have a shitzonyou, er Shitzu in the competition.Guest takes two more American stereo types and sautés them up for your fancy.

The trio have a standard POODLE- natch-in the show.Smaller parts are also played to perfection by some familiar faces...Larry Miller as a rude and crass one-of-a-gizzilion ex-lovers of Cookie Fleck. Fred Willard as a straight faced all around jackass who narrates the proceedings at the show. Many more peek in... Any good looking men you ask? Guest is a studly man kabob- but he's been married forever to perky Jamie Lee Curtis- she'd kick our buttocks real good if we so much as softly tickled the man on the side of his strong jawed facial area with our over zealous tongues. You can ogle at Levy (above with O'Hara)...Now Eugene's what I call a full- fat- heavy- cream- man soufflé gals...be good no hootin' and hollarin' and the theater now.Sorry Charlies-not a babe in the whole darn thing-your plum outta luck thisin' time around.If your into Guest's past endeavors-Run.Go.See.

There are some serious comic actors and actresses in this film and they all do an amazing job of portraying a wide array of personalities. In a weird way each character is like a spoof of itself. What they all have in common is their participation in the Mayflower Dog Show in Philadelphia. This is apparently THE show to win and when the film opens we are introduced to each dog and their human. The movie takes us through the pre-show preparations right up to the Best in Show announcement. Along the way are short sketch-like segments with each owner and their dogs. Talk about cat fighting!!!(Pardon the pun!) Some of the owners are so neurotic, rude and demanding it's a wonder their dogs are functional. But that's the whole tongue-in-cheek-point.Unlike most animal films the humans steal the show because, as I said earlier, the actors are incredible. I especially loved Fred Willard's portrayal of one of the show's commentators. I laughed out loud at almost every line he delivered. The dogs were all impressive actors but the best actress Oscar should go to the Standard Poodle who must have had to endure hours and hours of grooming for her close-ups.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, even cat people. It offers a behind-the-scenes look at dog shows and what goes into winning the top prize.

It has a feel that is very like Waiting for Guffman, and uses a lot of the same cast, but Guest has become much more polished, and he manages to make fun of his subjects while still treating them affectionately. Also, the pacing is much more even than Guffman -- this movie has no dead spots in it. There are no big gags in the movie, but there is a constant stream of very funny situations and character driven jokes (including one nicely handled running gag). The cast is perfect, and they do uniformly excellent job with the material. (For example, Fred Willard is hilarious as the co-commentator of the dog show; I usually get very tired of his performances, but this time the material and his performance are right on the money.

Chris Guest has few (if any) equals at the devilishly simple art of creating space for humor. He appears to have taken a basic script outline and given the pieces of it to the players bit by bit, trusting them to work out the details as they go. The comparisons with _This is Spinal Tap_ are inevitable, but thankfully they do it no harm _Best In Show_ can stand up against _Tap_ which no shame whatsoever.Posey and Hitchcock nearly steal the film as a pair of infantile, materialistic yuppies sublimating their feelings toward one another through their dog. The rest of the cast swings valiantly and with verve (Ed Begley and the legendary Fred Willard deserve special mention). But what really makes this ad-lib showcase work is the editing, and the space that Guest creates for the laughs by letting the characters be ridiculous (and yet somehow likeable) all on their own. He resists the temptation to telegraph the punchlines (as if there were any!), and in so doing allows them to sneak up on you.If you don't get a chance to see this in its theatrical run, by all means rent it and share it with friends -- this is not a movie to watch alone -- it begs to be shared.

Plus, I'm quite sure there is more to be gained from additional viewing, as turned out to be the case with Guest's other mockumentaries, This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting For Guffman, which are full of details; besides the details, the variety of interesting characters means that one will understand better the nuances i.e. additional/missed humour in repeat viewings.I am glad Guest decided to ridicule dog shows, because dog owners generally tend to be (even) bigger nitwits than the rest of the population, so one can imagine what kind of dolts prepare/groom their bark-happy, clueless darlings for months and months just so they can parade themselves in front of an equally moronic, apathetic crowd. In fact, if anything Guest was being mild in spoofing these people.Of all the couples and individuals competing with their mutts, the best comedy came out of Parker Posey i.e. the yuppie couple, and Levy/O'Hara. The highlight for me was the latter pair visiting Larry Miller and his wife; it was a pity Miller appeared only in that segment. Another highlight were the various histrionics between and by the yuppie couple, especially the lost toy drama.

The main difference between Show and Guffman was the characters, or not really in the characters, as some were similar, but more in how they were used. In Show the characters had little real depth to them, and the tragedy was that they just weren't used in very funny ways. Interesting types of characters, yes, but it's almost like Guest created some interesting people but they didn't do much with what they had. Guffman had interestingly flawed characters, as does Show (although the Show characters are just more obnoxious than anything else), and the moments they created and the world they exhibited seemed more poignant and colored more broadly than in Show. The Catherine O'Hara character was just a lame one-joke thing repeating through the movie, and the other main characters had little more to offer. Fred Ward as the dog show announcer was amusing at times, and obviously the funniest part of the film, but unfortunately that's not saying much, and it wasn't as if it was a real side-splitting kind of thing. Actually, my favorite part of the film was watching Ward's British counterpart react to him, and the two announcers together were a good part of the film. But as a whole, it was pretty weak, crude, and quite a disappointment. I'd still be interested to see the outtakes on the DVD.

Now Mr. Guest has gone the way of American Movie and Fargo by taking a rather unsettling delight in savaging people for no apparent reason other than their sheer simplicity. You'd think Mr. Guest would have at least one friend with enough decency to drag him off these sorry folks before he pummels them to death. I've heard the term dark comedy tossed around a lot in connection with this emerging sock-it-to-the-little-people genre, something I understand to mean people are uncomfortable laughing at this stuff. Curb Your Enthusiasm gets dubbed a dark comedy, though not necessarily because taboos are being broken, or because Larry David has pushed us into un-charted waters, or left us without a laugh-track to explain to us when laughter would be appropriate. As Lee Siegel writes in his dressing down of Mr. David and his comic insignificance (The New Republic, 1.7.03), satire makes more comic sense when the underlings are taking the piss out of their superiors. When the Davids and Guests of this world are pissing on the little people, it's not really satire so much as sadism. Mr. Guest's signature icy stare is beginning to remind me of the Larry David f*** you look Siegel finds so ridiculous--because the contempt it registers is usually directed, as he says, at some minimum-wage-earning shop-clerk. Mr. Guest, aka Lord Christopher Haden-Guest, 5th Baron of Saling, is now cutting himself from the same insecure spoiled-brat cloth, asserting his supremacy over rural Americans and torturing them as the Coen brothers tortured those hapless northern Minnesotans, simply for having made a blip on the cultural radar. School plays? Dog shows? Next he'll be attacking cheer-leading contests and bake-offs. Apart from the occasional delusion of grandeur Guest attributes to these country rubes, they seem to know for the most part that they don't have any reason to take much pride in their lives except by the criteria they invent in order to be able to take pride in something. It would be a lot easier to laugh if the C. Guests and L. Davids and Joel and Ethan Coens of this world were a little more clear about identifying themselves with the people, the class and caste of people, they attack with such relish.

Something that works to make sure you get it usually seems insulting. This kind of thing is best kept on TV.The beauty of Spinal Tap is the subtle and graceful presentation. Best in Show lacks most of that. As Guest can be smooth and careful, I wonder if Levy is driving the heavy-handedness - his work on SCTV was always too much in this vein a skit would be funny for a minute or two and then say the same thing over and over and over. Much like Steve Martin - the humor is in Steve's head and the viewer doesn't matter much.Net, shame that Guest has veered away from the subtle approach as he once had something to say.

It's just stupid.....no real plot, no good script.  Blegh!If you need to see a dog flick, pick up Lassie, Old Yeller, or Cujo. At least you'll see more dog vs. bad acting.

No joke.This movie was so boring and it seemed to get worse every minute. There was a lot of poor acting and cheesy jokes (I assume they were jokes as there was usually a pause to account for your non-existent laughter) This movie was so terrible I switched it to French Audio with Chinese Subtitles just for a laugh.If this site let you rate 0 then this movie would get it for sure.This movie was so painful to watch i'd rather watch a 4 hour episode of Hamtaro (And that show is painful enough as it is!)

You are all sick in your heads. The idea that this move has a rating over 2 makes me even more angry and after seeing this movie I thought that was impossible. I am a proud voter here at IMDB with 300 titles voted on. You people who voted kindly on this are a disgrace. For all of you that haven't seen this here is a quick little run down. You know those terrible people who annoy you every time they talk? Imagine spending a full hour and a half listening to them. 9 of them to be exact. Even the cute value of the dogs didn't come close to saving this horrid movie. Even the $2.75 I paid for it was a rip off. One of the worst films I have ever seen. Only movies worse then this are Supernova and of course, the most terrible of them all, Omega Code. "}]
