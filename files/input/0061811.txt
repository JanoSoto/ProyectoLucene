In a bad movie, all of the racist characters would be one dimensional and one hundred percent evil; here, Steiger is allowed to play a prejudiced man who is actually sympathetic and capable of growth (hence the Oscar).  In a great twist, Virgil Tibbs himself is shown to be capable of prejudice, as he pursues Endicott without sufficient evidence.  It's refreshing to see a movie that portrays the entire spectrum of racism, from the crazy extremists (and there are plenty of those on hand here) to the more subtly prejudiced. Mississippi Burning, a weaker effort, is not only more tediously didactic, but also less progressive; that film doesn't feature a protagonist like Virgil Tibbs, and instead focuses on the actions of two white federal agents.  In this case, the old movie really is the better movie; produced at the height of the civil rights struggle, In the Heat of the Night feels more immediate and passionate than preachy films on the subject that were made years later, after the tension had died down.    Some reviewers complain that the mystery segments of the film are confusing, but I follow them without much trouble.  Tibbs does a great Sherlock Holmes routine throughout, as he pieces together the solution based on clues that are also available to viewers.  Sure, the ending is surprising, but it doesn't come entirely out of left field; I actually admire the subtle ways that clues are sewn throughout the film.  If you're not used to mysteries, the barrage of red herrings and dead-end clues might surprise you, but it's pretty standard stuff for the genre.I knew about the classic line They call me Mr. Tibbs! long before I actually saw this movie.  I used to wonder why the line was so famous; it doesn't sound that exciting, does it?  But when I finally heard Poitier say it in context, I asked my brother to pause the tape so I could cheer without missing any of the subsequent dialog.  That's how excited I get during this movie.  The performances are so naturalistic, and the racial conflict so vividly drawn, that I get pulled into the action completely.  Though 1967 was a strong year for films, I still think that the right one got Best Picture, and not just because it was topical; In the Heat of the Night is a well-directed, superb character study, populated by some of the most vivid characters I've ever encountered in a movie.

Beautifully atmospheric, Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography and Norman Jewison's first rate direction make you feel the humidity of the small Mississippi town in which a black detective teams with the redneck sheriff to solve the murder of an important industrialist.As sheriff Bill Gillespie, Rod Steiger is superb in his Oscar winning role, and this film provides Sidney Poitier with some of his greatest screen moments, including his famous admonition to Steiger that became the title of the less impressive 1970 spin off They call me MISTER Tibbs! This is one of the few politically correct films to make its point without resorting to heavy-handed, sanctimonious preaching. Stirling Silliphant's Oscar winning screenplay never hits a false note, and the change that occurs in the relationship between the leading characters is subtle, and, therefore, believable. The two stars are ably supported by an outstanding cast of both veterans (Lee Grant, Warren Oates, Beah Richards) and newcomers (Scott Wilson, Quentin Dean, and the delightfully creepy Anthony James). The score by Quincy Jones, featuring Ray Charles' rendition of the title song, captures the proper mood throughout. In a year when the odds-makers were predicting an Oscar victory for Bonnie and Clyde or The Graduate, In the Heat of the Night surprised the prognosticators by taking the Best Picture prize and four other Oscars. Considering its theme of racial tolerance, it seemed an appropriate choice at an Oscar ceremony that was postponed following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The film's theme made it timely, but its artistry makes it timeless. The Academy made the right choice.Brian W.

Just look at the opening credits to In the Heat of the Night and you will see that not only does he get an above the title starring credit with method maniac Rod Steiger, but his name also appears first. Something that could have easily been switched around and overlooked considering the importance of each character. But for this socially aware thriller born of the turbulent sixties, it had to be, most definitely, a conscious choice.For Poitier, this film, along with Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?, marks the last of his civil rights driven roles in which his character's race is an all important plot element. From Edge of the City to The Defiant Ones, Poitier excelled in bringing intelligent and commanding three dimensional characters to life. A feat he had to succeed at if his films were to gain the trust of a predominantly white audience and push for racial equality. Call him the Jackie Robinson of Hollywood.When we first see Poitier as Virgil Tibbs, he is stepping off the train in the small Mississippi town of Sparta. Although we can only see him from the waist down, we do get a quick glimpse of his hand and from that we are aware of his race. An important fact for the audience to dwell on later when Rod Steiger as sheriff Gillespie, standing over a dead body on Main Street, and calls for his deputy to round up any strangers for questioning. From that moment on, director Norman Jewison establishes the racial tension that will only grow more and more intense as the film goes on.Sometimes, the film is far from subtle in exploring the issue of racism. Endicott's plantation, complete with tall white pillars and a black jockey lawn ornament to guard them, is a perfect example. What starts off as a surprisingly civil conversation between Tibbs and Endicott quickly turns heated and unpredictable. From that moment on, the experience will serve to cloud Tibbs' judgment and bring his own flaws to the surface, making him almost as complex a character as Gillespie. And it is the complexity of Gillespie that got Steiger the Best Actor Oscar over Poitier in 1968. This man has heart, but not made of gold, and his motivations are far from pure. He is simply a man who believes in doing his job, and doing it as just as possible - even if it means arresting a friend for murder. Take for an example the scene in which Tibbs is surrounded by a gang of blood thirsty locals. When Gillespie arrives to save the day, he simply gives them a warning and tells them to go home. It is only when they insult him personally that he becomes angry and takes a swing. His action is just - his motivation almost vain.In the end, after the murder is solved and racial injustice is swept back under the rug, Tibbs and Gillespie say their farewells and continue on with their very different lives. Each one better off for knowing the other.Rating on a 5 star system  5 stars  "},{"Title":"The Sun Has Set -- And You're Still Here?","Date":"25 April 2002","Score":"54 out of 68 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Pauline Kael remarked at the time of the release of this movie that Hollywood seemed to have divided the United States into three parts. There was New York. There was The South. And then there was everything else. This is a story of The South, circa 1968, with African-Americans as a second and much lower caste in the cotton-picking, sweltering South. The story is well known. Sidney Poitier is Virgil Tibbs, an expert homicide detective from Philadelphia (Pennsylvania) who is told by his Chief of Police (Rizzo, no friend of blacks, as I know from living in Philadelphia at the time) to assist the local cops in the solution of an economically important murder. Tibbs' identity as a homicide cop is only revealed, in a funny scene, after he has been arrested for the murder by the pragmatic and inept local constabulary. Thereafter, he is nudged into helping them by their wheedling encouragement and his own arrogance. Lo! He solves the murder! Well, in truth, the solution isn't really important. Something to do with abortion and who's responsible, but it's a minor matter. And actually the final scene is unbelievable. Poitier, about to be slaughtered by a gang of murderous and thoroughly organized rednecks who have all kinds of guns pointed at him, stymies them all by simply saying, Look in her purse. In a Faulkner short story, the movie would have ended right there. There are three things that make this movie worth repeated viewing. One is the ethos of the film. The second is the acting. And the third is the production itself. The ethos of the film, by which I mean the values it examines, are locked into the 1960s, and even earlier. I recall hitchhiking through the South (Maryland, actually) and still seeing signs at the time reading Colored Only over the rest rooms. And an African-American friend who took pictures of such arrangements being followed out of town by a short string of local cars and stopped for questioning. The film reflects a dangerous and hate-filled time which Southerners have finally overcome, thank God. And yet this same ethos lives on in the minds of some Southern whites and even more African-Americans, not reflected in on-the-ground behavioral reality, but in beliefs. I taught for years in a Southern mostly African-American university before I came to realize how important this myth is to blacks. To ask them, or anyone else, to give up that history of persecution is to ask them to sacrifice a solidarity that is otherwise unattainable. There is us and then there is them. And they are the enemy which draws us together and from which we gain support and succor. There is not much segregation in the South or elsewhere (although it still exists), but there might as well be. From the point of view of any cohesive group, there almost NEEDS to be. Don't human organizations need a history of persecution? The Christians have Nero, Jews have four thousand years of it, including the holocaust, Irish have the British occupation, Moslems have the hejira, Mormons have the assassination of Smith. We -- who have once been treated unjustly -- have Victim Power. You can't understand us unless you've walked a mile in our moccasins.The acting. Rod Steiger deserved his academy award. He's often dismissible but not here. Standing around the initial dead body, worried, he's furiously chewing gum and trying to think of somebody to pin it on. Then he suddenly stops chewing, darts his eyes around, and says, Couldda been a hitch-hiker. A well-conveyed dramatic moment. Poitier is at least equally good. He was lambasted in some of the press for playing a super-black, a kind of white guy in blackface. The fact is that Poitier was one of the best dramatic actors who has ever appeared on screen, and this is one of his best performances. Oh -- he's put upon, true, but once he gets his transmission in the proper gear he becomes all too human. Showing off in a subtle way, wrong about the town's big time racist being responsible, and Gillespie has his number. Boy, you're just like the rest of us, ain't you. Warren Oates adds some much-needed comedy. The bad guy has a face that could clear a room without using a gun. The succulent young woman who is spied upon by the Oates' character should be squirted all over with whipped cream spray and eaten alive. Perhaps the funniest scene in the move is when she describes Oates taking her down to the cemetery and rolling around together on the cool marble slabs. Steiger stops chewing again, looks up in amazement, and asks, Sam did THAT? Not so much that he's shocked at his deputy's depravity, just surprised at his imagination!To end this quickly, okay, it was shot in Illinois. But does it capture the small-town South of the time! Two cars racing towards an empty garage and the camera shows us the squealing tires stirring up dust -- and a pile of burning, smoking garbage, which is what it's all about.

Sidney Poitier is a big city detective wrongfully arrested by a racist small police detachment after the brutal murder of the town's would-be financial savior. Once the matter is resolved and Poitier released, he finds himself aiding his former captors, including Police Chief Rod Steiger, in their quest to get to the bottom of the crime.An Academy Award winner for Best Picture, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT works on so many levels. It's a solid, unpredictable whodunit with beautiful cinematography and crisp direction from Norman Jewison. All the actors are on top of their games, particularly Steiger, whose not-entirely-likable chief gradually looks past his prejudices to warm up to Poitier. Poitier is his usual superb self, once again maintaining his vast dignity as the target of bigotry, much like he did in THE DEFIANT ONES.And like THE DEFIANT ONES, a key theme in IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is racism. In fact the racism on display here is so fierce and perverse that it's almost hard to believe (though I'm sure it didn't stretch a thing). You can't help but feel an emotional attachment to Poitier as he's subjected to taunts, attempted attacks, and off-color remarks from those who either don't realize the power of their words or don't care. Poitier proves again why he is perhaps the finest African-American actor ever to grace the screen.IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is one of those movies that, while not perfect, is impossible to dislike.

Eventually, the town's White police chief, the gum chewing Gillespie (Rod Steiger), accepts Tibbs' innocence. And the two of them then work together, reluctantly, to solve the case.Forty years after the film was made, the racial themes seem just a tad heavy-handed. Whites are always backward and racist. And Tibbs is smart, urbane, and sophisticated. But back in the 1960s, the filmmaker probably did need to be blunt. And the point is made that Blacks and Whites, working together, can accomplish worthy aims, even though old Black Joe is still pickin' cotton at the Endicott Cotton Company.As a whodunit, the story is fairly good, convenient coincidences notwithstanding. The clue to the killer's identity is pleasantly subtle.The film's cinematography and production design are terrific. Many scenes take place at night. And the opaque lighting makes for a moody, slightly dangerous look and feel. Loved how they photographed that train moving down the tracks in the Mississippi darkness, a metaphor related to the film's theme. And the sound of a train whistle adds to the mournful realism.Interiors look authentic. The masking tape that covers rips in a big leather chair in Gillespie's shabby office is so true to life. A single white light bulb hangs down from the ceiling in a small neighborhood grocery store, where the shelves are filled with empty fruit jars. And that greasy spoon called Comptons reeks of 1960's Southern rural reality.My only complaint with this film is the background music. Some of the jukebox songs are not consistent with the film's overall tone.In The Heat Of The Night is a technically well made, and quite interesting, murder mystery. Yet, it will always be remembered, rightfully, as the film that offered hope of racial harmony, during a decade in which there was none. Its Best Picture Oscar award is thus explained.

The Civil Rights Act had been passed in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965. But the impact of those laws was only beginning to be felt.Especially the Voting Rights Act. The town of Sparta, Mississippi where William Schallert was Mayor and Rod Steiger was sheriff now has a significant new voting population and blacks might be a majority in that county. But even if they aren't, they know have a voice in the electoral process. Someone like Steiger has to take that into account now. Of course some of his deputies might not yet be with the program which explains why when a murder/robbery is committed of a very prominent northern businessman, Warren Oates sees fit to roust Sidney Poitier who's an unfamiliar black face in that town.What a surprise they all get when they find out he's a top Philadelphia, Pennsylvania homicide detective and when his identity is established, his boss in Philly offers his services.Poitier and Steiger both have to work through their prejudices, how each sees the other to solve this mystery which writer Stirling Silliphant gives us several red herrings before we learn the truth. Though Steiger got the Oscar for Best Actor, it should really have been a joint award. Their conflict and growing respect for each other drives the film. Steiger needs his expertise and respects him for that and Poitier comes to respect Steiger for his honesty.Norman Jewison got great performances from his stars and the supporting cast of whom Warren Oates as the dimwit redneck deputy really shines.Though set in a very narrow period of our history, In the Heat of the Night holds up very well with some eternal truths in its story.

Civil rights marches and demonstrations, anti-war rallies, the summer of love,psychedelic music and backlash against the previously noted, 1967 had it all. And this great movie came out, about a small Mississippi town embroiled in a steaming hot summer and a sizzling murder case. The movie diverges from the book on many aspects, mostly for the better. This is a serious look at a nation and a community in turmoil. The acting is first rate, from Sidney Poitier (one of the greatest American actors of this generation, regardless of race), Rod Steiger, Lee Grant, Warren Oates and the whole passel of townsfolk. The plot has been well outlined in previous posts, so I won't belabor it. My favorite scene is when Virgil examines the deceased, looking for clues in discoloration, type of wound, etc., while the sheriff looks on with his jaw practically on the floor in amazement. You can plainly see that he wanted to pin the crime on a hitch-hiker or one of the town's less desirable inhabitants. While some may see the film as preachy or presenting Virgil as a superior to the hicks, seen in the context of its time, it really tells a lot about race relations of the time. The movie is well filmed with lots of atmospheric detail of the time and region (even though it was filmed in Illinois, some areas of Illinois and Indiana were very Southern in their feel and outlook). Great acting, a good mystery, fine cinematography and an important theme make this a must-see movie. 10 stars.

But in art, it just represent a stale, hackneyed period, to be forgotten as soon as we can get on to the real work at hand. - Clifford Mason It's hard to watch Sidney Poitier's classic movies these days. In the 50s and 60s he became Hollywood's token black man. The new, upstanding, righteous, handsome, dignified, strangely sex-less, African American, symbolic of progressivism, Civil Rights movements and back-patting, liberal film-makers. Poitier wasn't just an actor, he was a flag bearer, smuggling all that was good and just about The Negro into Hollywood. White audiences loved him. Blacks thought he was a joke. Ironically, Poitier got into acting because he was ashamed of his Afro-Caribbean roots, and worked frantically to disguise his West Indian accent. He wanted to be a proper speaking white man. Others used him because they believed that the Negro image is best served or rehabilitated by a black version of a white man in grey flannel suits, who takes on white problems and inherits a white man's sense of what's wrong in the world.Most of Poitier's films during this period followed a pattern. Director Stanley Kramer, not one to shy away from middle-brow message movies, had him tied to a white guy in The Deviant Ones, audience and co-star Tony Curtis learning that useful black men are our friends too. Meanwhile, The Bedford Incident saw Poitier turn his nose up to war mongering white boys whilst snidely calling them sir. Later, Duel at Diablo proved that the black man can also be an Indian killing cowboy, whilst dressed in slick, suave, grey suits of course, and the inspirational To Sir With Love saw Poitier playing a sex-less London school teacher whose students learn that hey, black people are great and make good teachers in white schools. And don't forget A Patch of Blue, in which Poitier plays a reporter who falls in love with a blind white girl. Typical of Poitier-film reversals, he's well off, suited and suave looking, while she's a dirty white girl from the slums. Their romance is sterile - white audiences weren't ready for interracial smooching - Poitier rescuing the girl and then politely sending her off to a camp for the blind, never to see her again. Then there's Guess Who's Coming To Diner?, in which Poitier finally gets to kiss a white girl (it's more of a peck), after which he proves he's a better white man than her family of arrogant Caucasians.These films are all entertaining in a sleazy, salacious sort of way, but the fact is that they trade entirely in countercliches and do not, as they proudly claim, change the stereotypes that black actors are subjected to. They are contrivances, art-less, in which Poitier is reduced to a showcase Negro who exists only in the white man's view of him. Always in clean suits, pure of motivation, dignified, surrounded by stupid, mean whites, the Poitier Hero, antiseptic and one-dimensional, always finds himself in a totally white world, with no wife, no sweetheart, no woman, no black friends, and tasked with using his innate goodness to solve white problems for whites. Such Black Saviour tales are resurfacing today. Think Blind Side, Precious, The Legend of Bagger Vance, anything with Morgan Freeman and Obama mania.And so In The Heat of the Night stars Sidney Poitier as a grey suited, angelic white man in black-face who finds himself trapped in the Deep South. Surrounded by racist, stupid, redneck cops, Poitier spends the first half of the film schooling white boys and proving that blacks are superior to whites at police work, medical examinations, manners, looks and speech. He's an African American Ubermensch.The film was directed by Norman Jewison, though, a director who makes comedies when he's not bludgeoning us with message movies. So Night has a sense of humour which your typical Poitier movie doesn't, Poitier's superiority played for laughs, and red-neck inferiority treated as a joke (see Watermellon Man). Other good moments include passing shots of workers in fields (alluding, briefly, to the South's reliance on the slave trade) and Poitier's stand-off with a wealthy local. Indeed, though the film is oft touted as being progressive for highlighting white on black racism, the only thing it deals believably with is black on white racism, Poitier learning to check his aggression, stop instinctively blaming wealthy whites, and to work with lug headed whites for a better tomorrow. In contrast, white on black racism is treated ridiculously. The film pretends to be progressive but amounts to odious titillation, playing like a lynch mob lynching whites while blacks are schooled on the dangers of stereotyping rich folk with less melanin. It's the kind of film where audiences snicker because a black man slaps the face of a rich, pampered, arrogant, locally powerful white man...but not before he slapped our hero, of course.Aesthetically the film is effective, Jewison capturing the heat, gentle winds and lazy atmosphere of the Deep South, and occasionally treating us to some moody night-time photography. The film's acting garnered awards but is mostly caricatural; a collection of tics. Rod Steiger's a mean curmudgeon, and Poitier does his Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart in black-face routine. Quincey Jones, Hollywood's go-to black-composer, did the score.7.9/10 &#x96; Peep-show sensationalism, diluted by some moments of humour. Worth one viewing.

These two men appear to have three things in common 1 - They are police officers2 - They are investigating a murder3 - They are both racistsIn the hands of a less intelligent writing team (John Ball novel, Stirling Silliphant screenplay) and director (Norman Jewison), the major question might have become can they overcome their differences and work together to solve the crime?. but this question would eschew the entire point and value of the film. In the Heat of the Night took home 5 well-deserved Academy Awards. Unfortunately, the great director Jewison missed best director because of the Academy' inexplicable love affair with Mike Nichol's The Graduate. Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier are, as you might expect, amazing. And the support cast and casting are remarkable as well. In the commented version of the film on the DVD, Jewison explains that he does not believe that any role is small. The meaning of this statement comes across very nicely in his films, especially In the Heat of the Night. Every character in the film is well developed and consistently played. Setting plays a major role in the Heat of the Night as well, and the film's perfect cinematography and soundtrack help contextualize the very nicely selected locations. Camera-work is essential to this film. See this film, then see it again with Jewison, Steiger and Lee Grant's comments turned on.

In a scene reminiscent from Boys in the Hood, Tibbs is harassed and immediately placed under arrest, solely based upon the color of his skin.Tibbs is subsequently cleared of any wrong doing by the town's constable Gillespie, played by the very talented Rod Steiger. However, as the film progresses it is clear that even though Tibbs is no longer a suspect, he is not welcome in the town.Eventually Tibbs is brought on to help the Sparta police department solve the murder but as Gillespie and Tibbs try to work together they are met with the bigotry of the townsfolk. A key scene involved Tibbs informing Mrs Colbert (Lee Remick) of her husband's untimely death. In an effort to console her Tibbs reaches out to touch her arm and Mrs. Colbert immediately pulls away, this occurred again moments later as Tibbs made another effort at contact. Throughout the film Tibbs is treated in a discriminatory manor by almost every white person he encounters. Even the low-life counter boy at the diner refuses to serve Tibbs a meal.With the use of different camera angles, such as a subjective point of view when officer Woods is driving his squad car, the audience is made to feel a part of the action. Low key lighting is brought into play during the interrogation scene between Tibbs and Gillespie and then again when Tibbs is sitting in the local jail. This lighting suggests a darkness or moodiness to the film that would not be there had it been filmed in full light.In the end, the racist views of the people don't change just because Mr. Tibbs has proved himself to be an intelligent, sophisticated man of another race. They go back to their lives and Tibbs goes back to his and really the only thing that is resolved is the murder.

While most of its other elements I could take or leave, the central relationship between Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) and Gillespie (Rod Steiger) is still riveting and manages to not be heavy-handed but subtle in its development and progress. Seeing Tibbs push down his anger whilst everyone in the town treats him with anger and violence is wonderfully portrayed by Poitier. On the other hand, seeing Steiger grapple with his morals with Poitier's arrival is a treat as well. Each has their own complexities to deal with and when they are together, it adds an additional dynamic to the proceedings. Not only does the film hold important historic relevance but the racial issues still hold meaning today. The two lead performances are electric and are the main reason for seeing the film although all of it is well done.www.cinemaenthusiast.com "},{"Title":"Solid enough","Date":"17 April 2008","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" It's solid enough for a Best Picture winner. The characterizations are deep and fleshed-out, and this is only enhanced by the two great lead performances (I would've given the Oscar to both of them), but I found myself wanting a bit more meat on the actual story. The whodunit mystery lacks real interest, and I wanted something more engaging and intriguing for these characters to do. I also found myself perplexed by the solution at the end - far too confusing a mystery to be an effective one. This may seem like a contradiction, but what I really wanted was a meaningful, layered story, not a twisted, confounding one.It's got a great sense of style about it, helped by that great score and Jewison's often flashy direction. But, in the grand ol' year of 1967, it's got nothing on Bonnie and Clyde or even The Graduate. So, a solid enough BP winner, if not a deserving one. "},{"Title":"A solid, intelligent film. (Possible spoilers)","Date":"21 April 2002","Score":"5 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Hollywood isn't as liberal as it likes to think.  Too often its message movies are behind the times they condemn, trailing behind the trailblazers who have the nerve to speak out when it matters.  In The Heat of the Night is something of an exception.  Beyond that, it's simply a great film.Principally a detective story, the murder of a wealthy businessman in small-town Mississippi is, for the most part, only a framework around which the real story can be told.  This is a battle-of-wills between Detective Tibbs and Chief Gillespie, a struggle for power between black and white, a contest for acting honours between Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger.  While there is no doubt as to which character is the victor, and which race is the most shamed, the actors are absolute equals.  Both give superb, layered performances.  Steiger's Gillespie is racist, proud, but lets us feel a degree of pity; Poitier's Tibbs is intelligent, thoughtful, but shows a degree of arrogance.  These are not simply characters, but people.Some have complained that its message is far from subtle, that the lines are too clearly defined, that the racism is too overt.  Such criticism comes from those with little understanding of history and little appreciation for context.  This was 1967, this was the south; this was how it was.  Remember, this film came only four years after Martin Luther King told us his dream, only three years after amendments to The Civil Rights Bill were passed, only two years after the murder of Malcolm X, and only one year before the murder of Dr King.  Its message certainly was not subtle, it had no need to be.  Its delivery, however, is subtle enough that even today's audience can appreciate it.Beyond the superb performances, and the dignified message they contain, there are details that give the film a greater depth.  When Poitier is being frisked by Officer Wood, he's told to spread his fingers apart, so that he can `see all ten'.  Poitier doesn't move them; they're apart enough already.  That non-reaction is a great moment, showing that he's been here before, that he knows the drill, that'll he'll tolerate it because for now he has to, but that he won't take orders without reason.There is so much to praise here.  The slow pace of the film should kill its tension, but instead it reflects the sticky heat and the leisurely pace of life in the town.  Never is it too slow.  The scene where Steiger would rather condemn one of his own officers than lose another point to Poitier's big-city detective skills is a high point, as is the gentle yet vicious racism from Endicott.  The conversation between the leads in Steiger's house is surprisingly touching; its brief moment of bonding never seems patronising or contrived, and is expertly ruined by the crudeness of Steiger's racism.  The characters' growth is slight, uneven, and without any real payoff.  And that's by no means a criticism.In the Heat of the Night is a film that simply has to be seen, one that soars despite all that could have brought it down.  It should be preachy but it isn't; it should have dated but it hasn't; its slow pace should be leaden but it's perfect.  This is a rare kind of a film, and one that after a run of terrible movies has helped to remind me why I love cinema in the first place.  I'm grateful for that.

It's small, desolate, and drenched with unbearable heat. The citizens are self-serving. The picturesque advertisements that paint the faces of the middling businesses are deceiving. At times, the town resembles something out of a '60s teen romance film, a quaint but calm setting that lets love grown on trees. But like in Twin Peaks, there is a labyrinth of an underground that takes the wholesome Coca-Cola posters and white swing-sets and knots them into a dirty, unsightly torrent of dust and hatred.When a prominent entrepreneur is murdered, his body discarded in an alleyway, the town's police force doesn't know what to do with the case. Most people have mutually decided to mind their own business, only to join forces when an unwanted visitor makes their way into the isolated bubble that is Sparta. Murder was hush hush before. Bodies being dumped in the middle of the street is something completely new to the citizens. Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) orders his staff to search the area, looking for anyone who may have seen or heard something, or, simply looks guilty. One officer finds an African-American man (Sidney Poitier) sitting alone in a train station; Sparta, being the brewery of racial tension that it is, doesn't ask any questions when he is arrested purely on the basis of his skin color.But once he arrives at the police station, he makes a fool out of everyone; he introduces himself as Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphian homicide detective that is merely passing through the town to catch an upcoming train to Memphis. He wants nothing more than to leave, but his chief orders him to stay and aid the investigation. Gillespie has never known anything other than bigotry, but he is suddenly forced to push his personal views aside and follow the duties of a policeman. Tibbs, meanwhile, has to continuously defend himself from the prejudiced people of Sparta, some of whom are viciously violent when it comes to keeping the status quo in check.In 1967, the social climate of America was drastically changing. After years of fighting for equality, blacks were finally getting the respect they deserved, even if that process was more gradual than it should have been. Varying cultures were beginning to have more opportunity than ever.But then, there were towns like Sparta, buried in the deep South. In the middle-of-nowhere and completely separated from the open-mindedness of the big cities, the Spartas of America didn't want and perhaps weren't aware of the changes that were being made in society. In the Heat of the Night remains so important because it's both a steadfast look into the ugliness of prejudice and a snapshot of a transitioning world.Beneath all the sweat, snarling animosity, and tumbleweeds, there is a triumphant truth to every single scene. All his life, Bill Gillespie was taught that African-Americans were underneath him, him being a superior, mighty being. But when Tibbs comes onto the scene, we can see a newfound flicker in his eyes. He wants to scream and shout the most appalling things imaginable and put down his newfound colleague in the same way he has treated the black citizens of Sparta. Yet, he can't. Tibbs is a better man and a better detective. He's a hell of a lot smarter than he is, too. In just a matter of days, a realization hits Gillespie unexpectedly. Maybe, just maybe, no race is more sophisticated than the other. Maybe. The fact that, less than 50 years ago, cities were still as racist as Sparta is stunningly maddening. But Tibbs and Gillespie's relationship represents something more than just two guys attempting to get along. The film represents something more too. Take away the mystery, the formal vocations, and the suits, and you get a full view of a predominantly white society finally understanding the wrongs of their past. As hesitant as they may be in terms of correcting them automatically, there's a knowledge that going on with such discrimination will be venomous, a severe death wish on every person in the room.Poitier and Steiger are absolutely excellent. They are capable foils that bounce off each other with ceaseless energy. Poitier is electric, stoic and utterly powerful; the scene in which he slaps a small-minded plantation owner is totally sensational. Steiger is extremely fascinating to watch &#x96; he isn't your average movie bigot, as there is a lurking variable that fuels his hate more than mere racism. In the Heat of the Night is Southern-fried and completely without boundaries. It's an above average detective film, but beneath its whodunit tropes lays a scathing commentary that still remains relevant.

The primary suspect, at least to this cop's black-and-white eye, is a lone black man, well dressed and carrying a wad of cash, whom the cop discovers waiting at the deserted train station. The 'suspect' turns out to be Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), a Philadelphia cop who just happens to be an expert on homicide. Local Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) is the gum-chewing arrogant white Southerner with as much bluff as brains. He walks with a cocky swagger, spits venom at black men, snorts sarcastic remarks at his subordinates and is too quick to pick up suspects and forcibly wring confessions from them. Disgusted with Gillespie's arrogance, he can't get out of town soon enough but gets interested in the solution of the murder when Gillespie jails a second suspect, a frightened young man whom Tibbs proves to be innocent. At the urging of the victim's widow, Gillespie grudgingly asks for Tibbs' help in solving the murder. Reluctantly Tibbs obliges and under such unusual circumstances, the two find themselves working together at cross purposes, each following the wrong clues but, in the long run, each contributing to the apprehension of the killer.'In the Heat of the Night' turns out to be an absorbing contemporary drama, expertly straddling the line by relating an old-fashioned murder-mystery in a jazzy style. A great deal of the credit goes to the director, Normal Jewison, for creating the right atmosphere and for running the story off with no waste motion. His direction is crisp and invigorating, and the minimal use of stylistic flourishes that often date other films of the late 1960s gives the film an ageless look.What makes the film compelling today for reasons beyond its unconventional style, is the guarded relationship between Tibbs and Gillespie, which begins in almost comical hostility and ends in mutual admiration. Poitier and Steiger have such strong chemistry together that their relationship comes alive and grabs you on a gut level. It grabs you most of all because each actor is excellent in portraying that slow evolution of his character's world-view. As Tibbs, Poitier swallows his anger until he nearly chokes on it, letting his eyes say words he's barely able to keep from speaking. As Gillespie, Steiger similarly has to hide his feelings, particularly the professional respect that's making him question a lifetime of ingrained racist ideas, overcoming his prejudices in spite of himself. It's a pleasure, all too rare, to watch two splendid actors pitted against each other with such dynamism!In the Heat of the Night is a detective yarn of the highest order, crowned with two knockout central performances that makes this a sensational murder mystery!

In his path he finds many difficulties and of course on of them is racism because he is an African American and the town is a racially hostile southern town. After some investigations that he makes he finds out some very interesting results but he has some problems with the local police chief of this town and things are getting more complicated.I really liked this movie because of the plot which I found very interesting with many swifts and in many times I found myself considering that one person in the killer and after some minutes I changed my opinion about it and I could not be sure for anything. I also liked the direction which made by Norman Jewison and it was very good. About the interpretations I have to say that I liked the interpretation of Rod Steiger who played as local police chief Gillespie (won the Oscar for the Best Actor in a Leading Role). Another interpretation that I have to mention is Sidney Poitier's who played as detective Virgil Tibbs and he was simply outstanding on it.To sum up I have to say that In the Heat of the Night is a very good movie and you should watch it because it represents a period of time with many racial issues as many other movies but with a very specific difference. This difference is that we have racial issues and racism even when an African American is considered the best on what he does. I strongly recommend it because it has much of suspense and I am sure that you will like it very much also because it combines very well the mystery behind a murder with many social problems of those times.

The story begins, appropriately enough, with Poitier as a suspect in the murder -- the deputy (played with the usual low-key precision by Warren Oates) brings him in because he's a large black man who's a stranger in town. When Steiger discovers he's a fellow-cop, it's one of the funniest and also more poignant moments in the film.Poitier becomes infatuated with the idea of tying the murder in to the racist cotton plantation owner (Larry Gates), and risks his life at the hands of the angry rednecks who just don't want him around at all. there's more tension and drama surrounding the question of whether Poitier will escape town without being lynched than there is regarding the solution to the murder itself. That's what makes this film so compelling. It's still effective, unlike most of the other race consciousness films that Poitier made around that time. Steiger's character is carefully handled so that we're not sure how racist he was, or is... the point of the film isn't that Stieger is becoming less of a racist because he met an intelligent black man. It's that they become friends, or at least have respect for each other, regardless of race. He might still be just as much of a racist in general at the end. Racism isn't going to be cleaned up overnight because Poitier shows up. Special note should also be given to Quincy Jones' excellent soundtrack music highlighted by the title song sung by Ray Charles. It lends the film the right aural atmosphere to go along with Haskell Wexler's saturated hot night photography.

First Steiger wants him to go, then he wants him to stay, then go, then stay, then go. Steiger is supposed to be a racist, not necessarily stupid, so you have to wonder why he is willing to hang the first suspect he finds when he doesn't even know all the facts, especially when it's not even established if the suspect has an alibi or where or how he discovered the wallet. These are big plot holes and only one of several throughout the film. Aside from holes in the writing and directing, there are egregious goofs like the deciduous forest in late autumn during what we are lead to believe is supposed to be a sultry summer heat wave. Alongside goofs there are unclear story lines, like why the boy in the café hates the cop.The makers of this film were so intent on breaking a barrier they forgot to make a good film.

Many of the top-rated IMDb films on racism in the US are fairly recent, and, as such are essentially delivering to the viewer a nostalgic or re-imagined vicarious peek at the cultural phenomena. But this astounding one-of-a-kind film was made in the 1960s. In the 1960s racism, discrimination, and violence were neither theoretical nor nostalgic. They were on the TV new every night. Against that backdrop, this film parachutes onto the screen two of the greatest actors of their generation, Poitier (who, history will record, left the industry much too early, given his great talent) and Steiger who was so adept at his craft he could play a washing machine if you gave me a place to stand and an electric cord. Keep in mind also that many of the audience members who enjoyed this film at the time of release had never been in the rural deep south, nor did they ever want to be. So, now that I have set the stage, imagine what it must have been like to be sitting in the theatre when Poitier gets off the train on a hot steamy southern night, only be manhandled by the local deputy (for being the wrong color in the wrong place at the wrong time) only to reveal that he is in the law business himself, and then offers to help the locals deal with a crime beyond their ability ... the subtle looks, glances and grimaces in Steiger's facial expressions as, through the movie, he comes to see Poitier less as a racial stereotype and more as an associate is simply wondrous to behold, and reflected on a broader level the process that American itself was going through, collectively.

Rod Steiger plays sheriff Bill Gillespie, a good lawman despite his racial prejudices. When Virgil Tibbs, a well-dressed northern African-American, comes to town, Gillespie instinctively puts him under arrest as a murder suspect. Tibbs reveals himself to be a Philadelphia police detective; after he and Gillespie come to a grudging understanding of one another, Tibbs offers to help in Gillespie's investigation. As the case progresses, both Gillespie and Tibbs betray a tendency to jump to culture-dictated conclusions. Still, the case is solved thanks to the informal teamwork of the two law officers. Tense, funny, and thought-provoking all at once, and lifted by strong performances from Sydney Poitier and Rod Steiger, director Norman Jewison's look at murder and racism in small-town America continues to resonate today.Both riveting murder mystery and classic fish-out-of- water yarn, Norman Jewison's Oscar-winning In the Heat of the Night represents Hollywood at its wiliest, cloaking exposé in the most entertaining trappings.

The victim is a Chicago businessman who was planning to build a factory in Sparta; fearing that his wife will cancel the plans the police are understandably very keen to wrap the case up quickly.The police chief orders his men to search for vagrants and anybody passing through town; one of the first men brought in is the black man on the train. It soon becomes apparent that he isn't guilty; in fact he is Virgil Tibbs, a police officer from Philadelphia&#x85; a homicide expert. This being Mississippi in 1967 Chief Gillespie isn't keen on working with a black man but he comes to realise that he will have to bury his prejudices, shallow his pride and ask for Virgil's help. As the story proceeds; a variety of suspects appear and Virgil's presence soon attracts the attention of bigoted locals who intend to give him a beating or worse.If this film had been made recently it would still have been good but the fact that it was made in 1967 when the Civil Rights struggle was still ongoing makes it particularly important. It isn't just a political film though; it is a good mystery and could even be considered a 'buddy movie' as the racist southern police chief and the black northern detective come to understand each other. Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger put in career defining performances as Tibbs and Gillespie. There is not much real action but things frequently get very tense as Virgil gets into very dangerous situations with the locals who are clearly bothered by the idea of a black man in a position of authority; especially one who is clearly more intelligent than they are.

Sydney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs an African-American detective from Philadelphia, Pa. He is suspected in the murder of a wealthy business developer from Chicago, IL named Philip Colbert. The film portrays the racism in 1967 Mississippi as the murder investigation develops. Tibbs is faced with a significant amount of racism which is overtly displayed throughout the film. Rod Steiger who plays Police Chief Bill Gillespie is faced with a significant dilemma. He and his officers are untrained and unprepared to investigate a murder of any kind; however, especially the murder of a wealthy businessman who has promised to build a factory which will employ approximately 800 people of Sparta. The dilemma is when Tibbs is brought into the police station by Officer Wood who is played by Warren Oates and it is discovered Tibbs is a police officer and a homicide expert. Gillespie has to decide whether to go it alone regarding the investigation or utilize Tibbs to assist in solving the crime. The story continues with Gillespie and his officers accusing several people who are eventually discovered to be innocent. The investigation continues and Tibbs continues to face death threats, attempts to kill him, and overt racism. Tibbs eventually turns up the killer in an intense scene toward the end of the film.The theme of the film takes on two different paths. A significant theme is the racism which is directed toward Tibbs. Some of the racism appears to be stemming from Tibbs obviously being the smartest and most educated person attempting to solve the crime. However, and underlying theme begins to emerge which depicts how a friendship can develop between two people, regardless of how different they are when they recognize a common goal. Therefore, the main theme appears to be geared toward education about differences and racism which is dramatized through a criminal investigation.A significant theme in the film regarding how Gillespie has begun to change his view and opinion of Tibbs is when Tibbs and Gillespie go to the rich plantation owner's home, Eric Endicott, who is played by Larry Gates and is against the factory Colbert is proposing. Tibbs begins to question Endicott and Endicott recognizes they are not there for a friendly call. Endicott becomes upset when Tibbs questions him about his whereabouts from the night before. Endicott slaps Tibbs across the face and Tibbs immediately slaps him back. Endicott forces Gillespie into the encounter by asking him what he is going to do about Tibbs slapping him and Gillespie hesitates. However, eventually Gillespie only ask Tibbs if he is crazy after they have left the plantation. This is a significant moment in the film which portrays Gillespie's changing opinion of Tibbs. This scene appears to support the theme regarding education about racism and how it can be overcome when people recognize common goals.A film which has common theme regarding racism and education is Guess Who's Coming to Dinner 1967. This film causes a man who is a supporter of liberal agenda having to face the reforms he supports within his own family. However, this film maintains the theme of education and how people can overcome their beliefs when they recognize a common goal. The common goal in this film was maintaining the happiness of everyone involved.Lighting was significant to maintain the setting of this film. Lighting was typically low in the film. This supported the lack of education and wealth which appeared to be common in Sparta at the time of the film. This also supported the low opinion most of the community of Sparta appeared to have of Tibbs. Overall the low dim lighting supported the overall theme and plot of the film by making a large portion of the film to appear as if it is taking place at night when it is commonly thought inappropriate things typically occur. The camera angles deployed in the film also captured the intensity of the racism and the desperateness of the people wrongly accused of killing Mr. Colbert. The angles sometimes appear to be looking down from white people on to Mr. Tibbs, regardless that he is a tall man. This affect appeared to be used to make the racism more intense. The camera angles which captured the desperateness of wrongly accused individuals maintained a close up on their faces when necessary to capture the intensity of them portraying their innocence Overall the theme of the film is portrayed well. The film appears to focus on something everyone can relate to which is solving a common problem which benefits everyone involved. With the Civil Rights movement still pushing forward at the time of the film the theme appeared to provide relevance to how all people can live together without racism when everyone respects each other.

Here is a movie that I can watch over and over again, and it still feels fresh.Rod Steiger gives his absolute best Oscarwinning performance here. Go ahead, and argue, but that's my opinion. For a man that tried virtually every part and any genre imaginable, that may be hard to swallow. It's funny that the producer of this film, Walter Mirisch, who presented an honorary Oscar to Sidney Poitier, said that he won too. That's almost comical and the audience, who knew better, shook their heads. Maybe it was just an honest mistake, but I was actually shocked. That's a producer for you. Poitier had won two times before but for different parts.Poitier's career went a totally different way after he completed his work here. He went on to be a director of comedies and also acted in a few with Bill Cosby. When he was presented with the honorary Oscar, his work from the 70s onward were mysteriously missing from the montage of clips.That was a real digression from what I was going to write. As all know, this movie was spun into TV series, which was surprisingly good until the racial thing was abandoned and it dealt with more mainstream story lines, like murder and drug addiction.Let's remember this movie for what it was. A searing indictment of the unjust society, which still exists, sadly. Wouldn't you like that prejudice didn't exist? Sadly it does and not just hidden. To a certain degree, prejudice is justified. Just remember what happened after 9/11. Not just in the USA but all over the world.

Virgil Tibbs(Sidney Poitier)is arrested for a murder he did not commit, simply because he is an unknown person in the town of Sparta Mississippi. Tibbs was found at the train station waiting for a late evening train and brought in as a suspect.Tibbs manages to shock the officers especially the prejudiced,gum chewing and world weary Police Chief Gillespie(Rod Steiger),when it is discovered that Virgil is a Police detective from Philadelphia. Tibbs and Gillespie investigate the murder together and together face racial prejudice and hostility from the townsfolk.The heart of this film is the growing relationship between Tibbs and the Chief as they have to work together, as time goes on the Chief comes to value Tibbs as a man and is not bothered by the colour of his skin.A thrilling and at times touching film about two men struggling to get to the bottom of a murder and overcome the racism that is all around them.Poitier gives one of his best performances as the dedicated and fearless Tibbs, he will stop at nothing to get to the truth. It's interesting how Tibbs deals with the racism directed at him, he mostly ignores it and goes about his business, he can rise above it and appears to not let the cruel and stupid words affect him. One of the few times we see him resort to violence is when a wealthy racist plantation owner called Endicott slaps him, Tibbs doesn't take that and slaps him right back. It's a pivotal moment in the film and makes you cheer for Tibbs as he gives Endicott a taste of his own medicine. The film makes you really think about racism, why should one human being think they can treat another with cruelty just because of the colour of their skin? Steiger is equally excellent as Chief Gillespie, he won the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance here and it's a very well deserved. Lee Grant is also memorable as the young widow of the murdered man.An important film about racism, with an interesting and thrilling story and superb performances from the entire cast.

Coming out in 1967, it beat out some serious competition for the coveted prize including BONNIE AND CLYDE and THE GRADUATE, 2 films that to this day are considered landmarks of American film, and deservedly so. But that shouldn't take away from how special and great IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is in and of itself.The film stars the legendary, groundbreaking actor Sidney Poitier in one his great roles as Philadelphia police Det. Virgil Tibbs, who is passing through the sleepy, small town of Sparta, Mississippi in 1967. While waiting for his train back home to Philly, Virgil is falsely arrested by a Sparta policeman who mistakenly brings him in for a murder of a prominent businessman earlier that night. Virgil is taken to the police station and questioned by Sparta Chief of Police Bill Gillespie, played by the great actor Rod Steiger in a performance that won him an overdue Best Actor Oscar. Steiger beat out some SERIOUS competition that year in Dustin Hoffman, Warren Beatty, Paul Newman, and Spencer Tracy what a list of actors! Poitier and Steiger are brilliant in this film and each time I see it, I pick out another nuance in their legendary performances. This has got to be one of the great pairings in film history. The 2 actors play brilliantly off each other and there is not a false note in either performance. It's a shame that Mr. Poitier was not also recognized in the Best Actor category that year himself. It would have been great if there had been a tie and both men could have shared the award. I wasn't born at the time, but I saw an old clip of Steiger accepting the award and graciously acknowledging Poitier in his speech. Of course Poitier had won Best Actor a few years earlier, but for me, this may be my favorite performance and film of his.I'm not an expert, but anyone who wants a class in Acting 101 should pay close attention to these 2 stars of this film. Poitier is 100% believable as a police detective from a big city, not just in classy look and appearance, but also in his mannerisms and the dignified way that he carries himself. He is totally professional at all times and has a constant inquisitive nature. Steiger plays the middle-aged, burly, handpicked small-town chief to perfection. Although he reigns in his boisterous acting style and gives a much more controlled performance than appears on the surface, he imbibes Gillespie with old school toughness and when he lets loose and loses his temper, it is always done to great effect. He is totally believable as a Southern lawman.The murder victim was a rich man from Chicago who was building a factory in Sparta that would bring prosperity to the town, but in order to keep it going, his widow (played by Lee Grant in a brief but memorable performance) demands that his murder be solved or she will not go ahead with her late husband's plans. Gillespie, in order to keep his job and to satisfy the leading denizens of Sparta, asks Virgil to stay to solve the crime.Virgil reluctantly helps Gillespie with the murder investigation and goes through the typical rigmarole of being a black man in a racist Southern town that you would expect in the late 60s, but because of his guile, toughness, and self-respect, he carefully and methodically navigates through all the crap that he must take along the way to solving the murder and with Gillespie's support and help, does just that.Although the murder itself would seem to be a MacGuffin and the focus on the film is obviously on race relations and prejudice, it is actually an interesting and complex plot that holds the viewers attention to the very end. Even though I've seen it several times and know how it ends, I still find myself wrapped up in the mystery and thinking along with Virgil in trying to solve the crime. It's a great whodunit. But most importantly, it is a groundbreaking film about racism and its effects on the black man and how much extra he had (and still has) to go through in order to exist in a white man's world.With a fine supporting cast, an extremely solid script, a great story, and a socially conscious theme, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT is recommended viewing for many reasons. "},{"Title":"aka Guess Who's Coming to Investigate","Date":"13 May 2008","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" It must have been something of a slightly odd experience for Sidney Potier to act in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner right after or around the same time he starred in In the Heat of the Night. Mostly because, frankly, he was in THE definitive film about the condition of racism that was pretty much a matter of fact in the deep south (i.e. Mississippi) not just of 1967, but maybe of the whole late 60s (maybe To Kill a Mockingbird tops it for the decade as a whole, but it's close). Because it's not a story that seems kind of creaky by today's standards like 'Dinner', but it's seems like something that could still happen, to a certain extent, in the deep south. And what's doubly impressive is the nature of the town, the primitive attitude and defacto ignorance that makes this murder mystery story extra gritty. I'm not surprised it was Potier's favorite of his body of work.But to give credit where it's due, Jewison and his screenwriter, as well as DP Haskell Wexler and editor Hal Hashby, crafted an already compelling story that all they needed were the right people. Rod Steiger may not be quite as astounding as he was in the Pawnbroker, but it's probably a more accessible performance (a rightful Oscar winer), as the Chief of the town of Sparta where the murder of the main fat cat is killed and dumped in an alley. Only Tibbs (Potier), a Philadelphia homicide detective, can really solve the crime as a true expert, but is up against, well, pretty much the entire town save for Lee Grant's window of the fat cat who insists Tibbs stays. It won't be an easy case by any means, and not simply cause of the convoluted steps in the case; everyone, including Chief, hates and fears him from the get-go (which includes another officer, who is just more so an idiot, played greatly by Warren Oates).While it's a wide range of choices to see how honestly and even subtly racism is depicted in In the Heat of the night, one of the key points in the story for me is when Potier and Steiger go to see the Endicot character (only in one scene with Larry Gates), who treats him faux nice at first, then that smack heard round the world where he smacks Tibbs and Tibbs sends one right back, followed by a line that is pretty much 'I should have you shot.' As Tibbs and Gillespie walk out, Jewison stays for just a moment on Endicot as he starts to cry. Is it fear, or provocation, or just something internal that is just being tapped when confronted by someone who is strong and and intelligent and 'wont-take-s***' as opposed to beaten and broken down by the man?There's also the transformation, if only in the most crucial means, of Gillespie as someone who doesn't shy from dropping the 'n' bomb (he arises the iconic They call me Mr. Tibbs! line) or, in a way, the more stinging boy. We see the rednecks chasing Tibbs around and almost beating him to a pulp, only to be stopped by Gillespie at the last minute. One might think that this won't change, this attitude of racist violence in the south (or, for that matter, the topic of abortion that comes up in the last quarter of the picture, which helps to enrichen the scope of Sparta), but then Gillespie is the most hope that there is in this circumstance. At best, perhaps cynically, we can only hope for a you take care line before Tibbs, or whomever a minority might be to a white person, can get, which is in essence basic civility. Maybe that's the message, of the long road ahead with facing true and ugly racism that pervades small towns with very little contact in their rural quarters.This may make In the Heat of the Night sound like a message film, which it may be, but it's a great one because it focuses on what propels the story forward and keeping it entertaining for an audience wanting their murder mystery story. Unlike something like the recent Paul Haggis Crash, which also goes for the topic of racism head-on, we don't mind Jewison's targets as they're not pounded over the audience in an unrealistic manner, and the mechanics of plot, the daring of the performances, and the dynamic music from Quincy Jones, feel honest for the plot. It's a thriller with brains and it holds up very well 40 years later.

In that section it fails miserably. A good murder mystery should see you able to connect the dots between different events and hold you by making you guess different people along the way. The murder mystery in this movie offers little dots as such and the mystery is solved by Sydney Poitier's character seemingly picking out a character at random and suddenly twisting all the facts so that he suddenly becomes the killer. In the end the murder mystery doesn't really leave you with a finished connect-the-dot picture at all, rather an outline of one with half the dots unconnected.However for top notch entertainment and insight value you should definately hire this film and it is much better than the race relations rubbish that hollywood churns out now on a regular basis (which seems to be a race to see how many people can film movies involving the ku klux klan burning crosses on the property of an african american activist no one has heard of, and in most cases is made up).Just don't expect Sherlock Holmes.

He emerged as a response to the still raging civil rights movement but there is no doubt that a modern viewer expects him to be the most dignified, composed and knowledgeable character of the film and for him to be victorious, to bring about change. Just as easy as it is to dismiss the residents of Sparta, Mississippi as easy, caricatured targets, obnoxious racists to be made an example of. But this film is important, and you can testify the response of the infamous slapping scene to that - even as a sensationalised hoot for audiences to holler and gasp it paved the way for a more respectful black screen presence, and then beyond into the public's consciousness. This is why we need one-note characters like Henshaw, under suspicion of murder but with such a strong case of tunnel vision that he ignores the police chief entering his diner to brashly insult the black man and refuse to serve him. This is why we need the hooligans to brandish their crude weapons and creep towards Tibbs like they are hunting an animal (not far off from what they might have thought of him). And it is why nearly every character at one point refers to him with a condescension in 'boy!' (and worse) as though he is inferior, for some even the guise of being a policeman not wavering their bigotry. Then we have change, most primarily through Gillespie, whom acts as a measuring stick. If even one viewer could be swayed by the film after entering with a racist mindset, then job well done. Actually it seems that the modern consensus is more favourable of Steiger than Poitier. Whilst the latter was a little more complex than some have dismissed him (we see how even he admits his racial biases have clouded his judgement, and how Gillespie is able to appeal to his ego), Gillespie has emerged as the clear standout of the film. He is the police chief of the town and as such must act in a way that does not alarm even when someone as important as Colbert is murdered. So we see how his tough, grumpy exterior persona is put on even as he begins to warm to Tibbs because he cannot afford to be soft when a murdered is on the loose. Even more, he uses his anger as a way of filtering his growing admiration and respect for Tibbs not just as a policeman but as a human being - he momentarily cracks while he drinks, then snaps at him and quickly recovers. Steiger does not want to easily betray this change, so he chews furiously and only cracks a brief smile at the end. It is all we will get from him, but this film is the difference between this chief and the last, who may have shot Tibbs right on the spot.

It was an unremarkable film before I saw it, that didn't turn into much else after my viewing. There were so many remarkable films released in 1967, and films that have stood the test of time, it was difficult to accept that In the Heat of the Night took home Oscar's top prize. An important film dealing with huge issues, In the Heat of the Night, is a film that everyone should see once.What started as an innocent visit to his mother, Philadelphia Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) found himself arrested in a small town in Mississippi. the police chief assumed guilt because Tibbs was a black man in a suit that had money in his pockets. Only after contacting Tibbs chief, was he released from custody. Upon his release, and the realization that Tibbs is the number 1 homicide detective in his precinct, chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) of Mississippi P.D. reluctantly asks Tibbs for assistance in solving the case. The murdered man, Mr. Colbert (Jack Teter) had traveled from the north to Mississippi to break ground on a new factory bringing immense job growth to the small town of Sparta, Mississippi. After Virgil endures a tense run-in with Mr. Endicott, (Larry Gates) the most powerful man in the county, he turns his sights to him as the guilty party; as he would have the most to lose by the factory opening. As the racial tension mounts, Virgil's life becomes endangered, and he humbly realizes he was going after Endicott for selfish reasons. As the evidence mounts, Virgil redirects his efforts towards justice and apprehending the true guilty party.In the Heat of the Night told an intricate story about a town where becoming a police officer means everything. This attitude was best exposed when Sam (Warren Oates) was sitting at the diner indulging on a pie, and refused to be addressed by his first name, demanding he is called Officer Wood. The title of police officer was so important, yet, police work was done so inefficiently, and seemingly without effort. It seems to me that In the Heat of the Night took home Oscar's top prize due to its cultural relevance. The intense racial issues shown in the film, in which Virgil Tibbs has to fight for every ounce of respect he is eventually shown, only because of the color of his skin are important still today, nearly 50 years later as racism still exists. I am of the belief that the other Poitier film, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, nominated for Best Picture tells the story better, in a bit of a more relatable way.Sidney Poitier is excellent in every role I have ever seen him play; the role of Virgil Tibbs was no different. He was eclipsed, in this film by the acting of his co-star Rod Steiger. In what was perhaps the most stacked category every for Best Actor Oscar, Steiger took top honors, beating out Warren Beatty, Dustin Hoffman, Paul Newman, and Spencer Tracy. Steiger embodied the nuances of a small town police chief, subtly going against the grain and responding to a town that hated him for doing it. The camera work in this film was phenomenal, using the zoom shot exceptionally well, deservingly taking home an Oscar for Best Film Editing. In the Heat of the Night has possibly the best film soundtrack from any 60's film, and made the film all the more engaging.I would recommend In the Heat of the Night to any fans of the 60's as the film has the distinctive feel of a movie from that decade. I would also recommend this film to any fans of Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger's without question as the pair really make the audience feel what good acting is. Although I maintain that the Academy misjudged the Best Picture of 1967, it remains true that In the Heat of the Night is a good, important film; and one I was happy to see.

This movie confronts that reality head-on. Sidney Poitier put on a magnificent performance as Virgil Tibbs - a Philadelphia police homicide detective who's in the state visiting his mother when he finds himself unwillingly drawn into a local murder investigation, giving assistance to Sparta Police Chief Gillespie, played by Rod Steiger. Gillespie really doesn't want Tibbs' help - all else aside, him accepting help from a black man wouldn't look too good to the rest of the town - but under pressure from the victim's wife, he has no choice. Part of the movie deals with the development of the relationship between the two. Tense at first, there develops a grudging respect eventually, and possibly even a bit of a friendship. Gillespie knows he needs the help. Tibbs knows it too. But the two have to work this out in the context of the era, and it's fascinating to watch as they slowly learn to trust each other. The other part of the story revolves around Tibbs acceptance by the townsfolk of Sparta. Frankly put, he's not very welcome, and there are a number of scenes (especially one in a garage as Tibbs is confronted by a gang of rednecks carrying chains and lead pipes) that are downright uncomfortable, if not a little bit scary. I thought Poitier captured his character well. Tibbs is confident and even a little bit arrogant about his abilities. But, confronted by this environment, he also comes across as cautious, and at times even nervous or a little bit afraid - which would have been natural enough. Poitier did well with the role, but it was Steiger who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Gillespie. One can't quibble too much with the choice. Both put on very strong performances (Poitier was nominated for a Golden Globe) but I'd have frankly given an edge to Poitier. The actual murder mystery (the victim was a local businessman, and the suspects were several) isn't central to the movie. It's the study of race relations that's far more important, and I found this an interesting way to approach that subject.

It was a remarkable year for a leading actor--an iconic year that has seldom been matched--and it should be noted that he portrayed a high school teacher, a homicide detective, and a doctor. Those who would criticize Hollywood for the roles it bestows on actors of color should remember those roles in the acting life of Mr. Poitier at a time when the studios could not even count on a large portion of the country--the South--to support, or even show, the films.In each case, the stories revolved around race issues, and Mr. Poitier was up to the task. In the Heat of the Night won the Oscar for Best Film.The film centers on Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), a young professional from Philadelphia who changes trains in a small Mississippi town on his way back north. A murder has been committed in the town of Sparta and the police chief has ordered his men to comb the town for anyone who might look suspicious. Virgil is suspicious by virtue of being a stranger and a black man. Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) is quick to arrest the first possible suspect, mostly because the murdered man is a man of importance to the city.Gillespie finds that Virgil is acclaimed as the best homicide detective in Philadelphia, a fact that burns in Gillespie's craw. Not only does he lose his suspect, but it seems this young black man might upstage and embarrass the Chief.Steiger plays Gillespie as a gum-chewing cracker whose power is tenuous. Poitier plays Virgil as a proud man, sure of his own competency and, perhaps, somewhat out of touch with the way of things in the South. During the course of the film, they develop a reluctant reliance on each other, forged by the political exigencies of the situation and some common goals.So much could be written about this film. The script is one of the best. The acting is superb--by the leads and the supporting cast. The photography really captures the setting with a sometimes foreboding tone (with danger in the darkness, the demeanor and the décor). The soundtrack (by Quincy Jones) is, surprisingly, jazz-themed, but it totally works, as jazz is the musical connection between the deep South and the urban black centers of Philadelphia and Chicago, in particular.Virgil disturbs the balance of power in Sparta just by being there, and things heat up as Virgil uses his talents to solve the crime. As suspects and witnesses are interviewed, we find that race plays a tangible part in the testimonies. As a sidebar, let me mention that I found a commonality of themes in the way this film and To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) dealt with its female victims. Anatomy of a Murder (1959) also reflected a similar tone, though race was not the prevalent issue.The only spoiler I will include here is a recognition of the ending being nearly the same as that originated in the movie Picnic, where an aerial view shows the protagonist leaving town on a train and reveals the world of the film to be but a small community in a much larger world. "},{"Title":"Showdown In Sparta","Date":"28 April 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Watching Sidney Poitier go at it with a town full of hotheads and murderers is to force a change in judgment regarding his legacy as mere civil-rights avatar. Sure, the skin color was important, but wow, is he cool or what?Poitier's Virgil Tibbs has the bad luck of being in the wrong train station with too much money in his wallet when a rich man turns up dead in another part of the same town. Sparta police chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) would like nothing better to pin the killing on an outsider, and a black one would make for less trouble in this blinkered Mississippi community. Yet Gillespie's not a bad cop, and soon finds himself not just clearing Tibbs but leaning on him for support. It's not an easy match for either man.Steiger won the Oscar that year, even if Poitier was the man of the year in terms of starring roles (Guess Who's Coming To Dinner and To Sir With Love also were released in 1967.) Generally I enjoy Steiger more myself, but no one could have made In The Heat Of The Night work as well as Poitier does.Sure, he has a raft of terrific supporting performers, but Poitier does fantastic work with them all. He is sympathetic yet cagey with the victim's widow (Lee Grant), ingratiating with a hyper young suspect (Scott Wilson), smoothly confrontational with a bigoted fat cat (Larry Gates), and most importantly, rationally argumentative with Gillespie.I find Steiger a hoot, and I love the turn Gillespie takes in this movie. He's got the motive which is money and the body which is dead, and runs it all the way to the end zone. But everything good in the film comes back to the way Poitier plays it, or them. It's his journey we follow, and Poitier presents a marvel of subtlety and economy, his reactions played small for the most part.His first scene with Lee Grant shows what I mean. We see him tell her plainly, rather coldly, that her husband is dead, and then watch as she pushes off his attempts at offering correct comfort. Is it because she's white and he's black? That's how I viewed the scene for a while, until I heard Grant in a DVD commentary explain how she channeled the loss of her real-life husband in her scene. Her character isn't hung up on race; she just doesn't want to accept the truth. Tibbs, knowing this, is persistent in offering his hand until she accepts it, I think because Tibbs wants to know she is legitimately trembling and thus can be eliminated as a suspect. He's a good guy, yes, but he has a case to solve.The racial aspect of the film can't be ignored, but In The Heat Of The Night has a lot else on offer. Director Norman Jewison and his ace support staff (editor Hal Ashby, cinematographer Haskell Wexler, screenwriter Sterling Silliphant) knew how to keep a story moving, with a flowing narrative, tracking shots, and cool lighting tricks. You really feel the heat in this town in the way the neon lights flicker against the sweaty streets, the forlorn dog that looks for scraps in the railway station, and yes, that pretty girl who stands naked in her lit kitchen.Quincy Jones' music is easy to overlook, because it feels so at one with the movie's aesthetic. It's not soul or jazz, but country-pop, with one song, It Sure Is Groovy!, which we hear when the victim is discovered, sounding like a great Charlie Rich single from his Smash Records days (it's not Charlie, though, apparently).Ultimately, this is Poitier's film, and a classic whodunit wrapped in a social issues drama that never forgets to keep you on your toes. It's a liberal film that never slips into empty pieties, and makes you really care about the outcome even if the people of Sparta seem pretty worthless on the whole.

Also, with the passage of time, I felt it was dated and probably even a bit boring. Well, I can safely say that this movie is still a very entertaining murder mystery and while the take on black-white relations delivers a stinging stereotype of the Southern white male that wouldn't make sense after the 1960's, the characters and acting hold up well and the story can still keep our attention. To me Rod Steiger is the star of this movie as the blatantly bigoted and unprofessional town sheriff. Steiger's character is pitted against Virgil Tibbs, played by Sidney Poitier, a well-trained and smart as a whip police officer who is visiting from the north. Tibbs becomes a magnet for the town's potent and dangerous racism. Steiger's hatred brings a series of clever rebuttals from Poitier that are probably wasted on the rather stunted mind of the sheriff. Lee Grant, as the widow of the murdered man, insists on Poitier being kept on the case or she will take her husband's company and payroll out of the town. This is the only voice of reason that this town can understand. Poitier must fight off attempts to hurt and humiliate him and Steiger does his best to get the black upstart outsider to take his leave. If you haven't seen the movie, I would recommend seeing how it all plays out. Norman Jewison has directed a classic movie on the black-white divide that whacked the 1960's with such force. In The Heat of the Night stands as great movie and represents one of Hollywood's best efforts to entertain and inform audiences of the 1960's.

Once word gets out, the Mississippi police start looking for a man and by the nearby station they discover Virgil Tibbs (Poitier) who is trying to get home to see his mother. Using the stereotypical motion, that a black man (in a pre-dominantly white neighbourhood) has committed the crime, a police officer brings him in for the crime. However, it transpires that the black man (Poitier) that they have captured is a police officer from Pennsylvania who happens to be an expert in homicide. Tibbs offers to help the Mississippi police under the orders of his Chief (within a state that hates black people) to try and discover the perpertrator .There are several things that we need to be aware of; first of all there is the surface level theme of this film and that is the 'who dunnit', but then there is the deeper subtext which is the scenario of 'black man entering racist state and trying to help them bring a felon down'.- The people and police officers in Mississippi don't want him to help initially, but they soon realise that Tibbs is the key to solving the crime( those police officers that live in Mississippi are clearly not accustomed to the way that Tibbs and co solve crimes in his home state of Pennsylvania). The thing I really love about this film is that Poitier's character Mr Tibbs doesn't take any crap from anyone. I also liked that Rod Steiger's character Gillespie clearly cared about him and slowly warmed toward him towards the end. Poitier's character was also the smart 'black' cop which was ground breaking in 1967, he is the one that pieces the puzzle together and figures out what has truly happened rather than the pathetic Mississippi police officers (they use primitive skills to try to bring people to justice, whereas Tibbs uses actual police skills). I'm not going to reveal plot points, but let's just say that Tibbs gets his man. The way I see this film is that it is ground breaking as far as 'racial equality' is concerned and for me the 'who dunnit aspect' is a secondary factor.Summary; brilliant film, with great performances by Steiger and Poitier. A ground breaking and important film that is definitely worth seeing.

'Virgil' Tibbs is convicted of murder, mocked at his first name, discriminated for the color of his skin, ignored for his expertise, and is threatened by white-people of a southern town. He solves the case of a murdered businessman, the identity of the kingpin behind the murder is well-known to the residents of the county, and yet no one wants the case to be solved by a 'colored' visitor who's in the town to call on his mother. Virgil Tibbs visits the abode of the man behind the crime, accuses him of murder, and slaps him right across his face in the presence of the Chief of Police who could do nothing but remain a silent spectator. Sombre Sidney symbolizes the educated, well-paid 'colored' man, who despite the discrimination, makes you say he's a true Hero at the end of the movie. The time in which the movie was made- during the civil rights movement- is much appreciated.The review is incomplete without mentioning the wonderful song by Ray Charles Robinson, who, like Sidney, is a 'colored' man. "},{"Title":"Never judge a book by its cover","Date":"5 May 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" In the Heat of the Night is a film about a black cop in the south in the sixties. Playing the lead role is Sidney Poitier as Mr.Tibbs playing his typical role of a Black man breaking down stereotypes who has a little bit of a chip on his shoulder. Mr. Tibbs helps Chief Bill Gillespie played by Rod Steiger solve the murder of a prominent citizen.It could be said that the central insight or theme of this movie is racism. However this generalization does not do the film justice. The idea is bigger and older than that, In the Heat of the Night shows that you should never judge a book by its cover. Some of what made this a great film at the time is dated. The shock value of a black man being more intelligent than a white man doesn't work with modern audiences. However the bigger theme of prejudice does. This theme goes much deeper than racism in the 1960's south. The movie shows how prejudice blinds not only those who are racists, but how it can blind those on the receiving end. In this context the theme is and always will be relevant. Its influence reverberates in modern films such as American History X and Crash.The film utilized some motif's to illustrate its point. A cotton field is used as a visual symbol, of southern slavery, to show that in some ways little has changed in the south. The mood is well set by utilizing blues music, which effectively sets a melancholy mood.While on the surface this seems to be a movie about racism. If this were the case this would not still be a great film. This is a film that is bigger than the American racism of the post civil war south. It is a film about how everyone in anytime period can be blinded by prejudice. It reminds us how such ideas can cloud our judgment, even when these prejudices seem justified, such as Mr.Tibbs prejudice against racists. We are left with the idea we should not judge a book by its cover. It is this theme that makes what would be a good murder mystery film, a classic film that makes us question our own beliefs.

Well, regardless of the validity of these assumptions, I can clearly find in Norman Jewison In The Heat of the Night three great scenes that make the movie worth to watch, each one representing a crucial step in the narrative process.The first one occurs briefly after the murder of a local businessman, when Officer Sam Wood (Warren Oates) from the police of Sparta, a racist small Southern town, arrests a black man about to leave by the train station Virgil Tibbs, played by Sidney Poitier. Tibbs is therefore confronted to the Chief of Police Gillespie, Rod Steiger, who quickly jumps to the conclusion that he's the killer a black man who leaves the town the night of a murder, let alone with a wallet full of money, is immediately guilty by pure assumption. The genius of the scene comes with the realization that Tibbs is a Police Detective from Philadelphia. Gillespie arrested a colleague and not only the look on Steiger's face is priceless (if only for his mimics, he fully deserved his Best Actor Oscar) but this moment alone sets the premise of a film which echoes another Poitier classic The Defiant Ones. Tibbs and Gillespie investigate the murder together, both under hierarchical pressure, with their sense of duty as symbolic handcuffs until a mutual respect would graduate create the real bonding between the two men.The second scene, in the middle of the film, is probably the emotional highlight, the crucial moment that places In the Heat of the Night among the greatest classics. While the investigation lead to many wrong tracks, avoided thanks to Tibbs' expertise, it is especially undermined by a clear non-cooperation from Gillespie whose attitude flirts sometimes with racial prejudice, but less meant to express a true feeling than to destabilize Tibbs' self-confidence, until he's rightfully put in his place by the iconic They call Mister Tibbs! line with the emphasis on 'Mister'. In fact, we need to see another confrontation to understand that Gillespie was never truly racist. The encounter with the wealthy land owner Endigott, a name curiously rhyming with bigot, unveils the hideous face of racism hidden beneath the mask of hypocrisy. Understanding that he's being interrogated, Endicott brutally slaps Tibbs who retorts by an immediate slap and a piercing look of defiance. The timing of this exchange is so quick and unexpected that the looks on the other actors' faces (especially the butler) feel like genuine reactions.In that groundbreaking year of 1967, Cinema followed the steps paved by Rosa Parks when Sidney Poitier slapped the bigot. This scene alone justifies why In the Heat of the Night is highly regarded, ranked in the American Film Institute's Top 100 list, and winner of the Best Picture Oscar over other landmarks like The Graduate or Bonnie and Clyde. Norman Jewison film bravely breaks the ultimate taboos in terms of racial depictions because the thought-provoking aspect is less in the slap than the way it is shown. For us viewers, Tibbs acts as the spokesperson of a whole community, while Tibbs only reacts as a man whose dignity was offended. This mirrors the line he said to his father in the other 1967 Best Picture nominee Guess Who's Coming to Dinner 'You see yourself as a colored man, I see myself as a man' Tibbs is not the perfect man, and he's not portrayed with the kind of angelic indulgence owed to the poor victim.Indeed, In the Heat of the Night never falls in the trap of reverse racism and more than once, we happen to agree with Gillespie. The slap's aftermath is a strike of genius, as Tibbs clearly wants to arrest Endicott for the simple basis that he's a racist extremist. Gillespie delivers then a sober but powerful You're just like us, as if he realized how heinous they were, and how sometimes violence calls for violence with the same negation of justice. The film is already excellent as a mystery and a crime investigation, but it works essentially thanks to its emotional core the relationship between Gillespie and Tibbs. There's an interesting moment when reluctant to help Gillespie, Tibbs tells his boss No Sir, I'm not prejudiced, which is already funny in an ironic way. The film powerfully portrays the evolution of two flawed persons who'll overcome their own prejudices, before working together efficiently. The step for mutual respect is empathy.Throughout his journey, Tibbs experiences the ordinary racism that poison people's lives and realize that although he doesn't picture himself as a member of a community, people in town will, which nourishes his sentiment of belonging. Gillespie experiences the racism endured by Virgil and redeems himself while protecting him against a bunch of hooligans coming to avenge Endicott. Understanding one's condition is the necessary step to overcome the adversity and it's only by fighting their personal demons that both of them efficiently combine their efforts, this is not the key of the film's resolution, but it drives the dynamic of the story following a very positive trajectory. This leads to what I believe to be the third great scene of the film, the simple but powerful farewell and what makes it so inspiring is the way one simple smile from Gillespie while saying Take care inspire another smile from Tibbs before he gets on the train with a cool and bad-ass Yeah.Their expressions show how sincere they are about each other's feelings, mutual respect as another step for friendship. The film concludes like it opened, with the song of Ray Charles which conveys both the hotness and darkness of an era of which In the Heat of the Night is the most defining, back then when America's motto was We shall overcome!.

This movie has bad unbelievable plot twists right from the beginning that go all the way to the end but none of that matters. What does matter is what was at the heart of this movie, the acting and the message. This movie came about at a time when overt racism was still prevalent in southern culture. This movie shows us every stereotype associated with this blemish on American history, including cotton picking on the plantation and lawn jockeys, the only possible exception is the absence of white hooded KKK members though they are there just not in robes. Why this movie works is not the plot which is about solving a murder, but the struggles of both blacks and whites to get past racism following the civil rights movement. In this regard it not only works but deserves to be called a classic because of what people, who are growing up now in America with a mixed race President, can take from a time not too long ago when things were much different in this country.

Most are re-examined decades later and deemed ahead of their time. Norman Jewison's film, however, is so complex and earnest in its portrait of race relations in the 1960s that audiences were stirred by it then as much as we commend it now.What makes In the Heat of the Night as effective now as it was in 1967 has to be the approach. Neither the script nor the direction tackle racism head-on in an explicit manner; the film slowly builds racial tension by feeding off viewer assumptions and creating racist undertones in the characters and their actions.When we first meet Detective Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), he's being arrested on suspicion for murder. He doesn't say so much as a word and the clear implication is that he's being arrested because he's black, but the characters and situations are composed in such a way that the racism doesn't feel blatant or entirely addressed. The dialogue does not confront the topic in explicit terms either. Instead, we have an unsettled and discomforting mood.We also never get a real beat on Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger). Both the character and Steiger's performance possess real depth and complexity. Few characters in cinema history (and none that I can think of at present) have characteristics that include deeply rooted prejudice and great understanding. Steiger so perfectly communicates Gillespie's conundrum of reconciling what he believes and the evidence that rests before his eyes, both in the murder investigation and the way he treats Tibbs.Tibbs is a Philadelphia detective with a strong forensics background who finds himself in Sparta, Mississippi assisting with a homicide case. Given that Civil Rights was a relatively new concept in America at the time, the racist attitudes and suspicious glares of the other small- town cops cast a heavy shadow over Tibbs' work. Poitier gives Tibbs this humble courageousness for much of the film but occasionally gives in to the anger the viewer will surely feel for the way his character is treated.In the Heat of the Night truly portrays the sorry state of the South in the wake of Jim Crow laws, a time when long-standing attitudes struggled to adjust and frankly, some never did. Steiger's Chief Gillespie represents the crux of this change as he begins to admit the errors of his judgement both in judging Tibbs and in doing his job. As equally powerful as the film's statement on race is its statement on the flaws of the justice system in certain parts of the country. Without Tibbs' help, two innocent men would have been tried and likely convicted of the murder thanks to the old Western sense of justice, that being someone has to pay.There are some head-shaking and jaw-dropping moments in the film, but In the Heat of the Night mostly succeeds in being subtle and displaying racism through tension more so than action. The truth is that while the frightening tales of hate crimes are much more compelling for the screen, this form of racism is what truly abounds, even today. With a couple knockout performances, the ideas of racism and justice in the film become much more than &#x97; pardon the pun &#x97; black and white.~Steven CVisit my site http//moviemusereviews.com "},{"Title":"Mississippi Gurning","Date":"7 February 2011","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" This is yet another movie that holds up after forty years or so.

Still, it is a stirring portrayal of racism from within the justice system and an engrossing crime drama. It perfectly captures the time period of 1960s southern society. The film drips perfectly with the swampy atmosphere of the locale - watching it, you can practically feel the humidity causing sweat to pour down your back. Plus, past the morals dealing with racism, the film can be enjoyed as a compelling mystery and character drama. Both Mr. Tibbs and Chief Gillespie are terrifically drawn characters with a good amount of depth that transcends any normal film dealing with racism (its a much better film than the recent and overrated Crash).On a technical level, the film is terrific. Sidney Poitier shows why he was one of the country's biggest movie stars for a period of time. As the cool and calm Mr. Tibbs, he offers what is possibly his best performance. Rod Steiger is just as great as Police Chief Gillespie, giving a lot of emotional depth to a character who could've been a stock type racist Southern male, not completely demonizing him but showing his inherit flaws. Its also odd seeing Warren Oates playing such a submissive character (I'm used to his tough guy roles in Sam Peckinpah and Monte Hellman's films), but hes great as always. The direction by Norman Jewison is workmanlike and aesthetically dull, but technically perfect and the film moves at a very quick pace. In the Heat of the Night doesn't have the impact now as when originally released, but its still a compelling film.

Once his name is cleared and the local police find out that he is a homicide expert, he is retained until the crime is solved. But the police only grudgingly accept him and the local community would rather see him lynched. Is solving the mystery more important than his own safety? I don't have a lot of experience with Sydney Poitier, the star of this film set in the Civil Rights era. But he comes across as very smooth and a fine actor. I'd love to compare him to Denzel Washington, but, of course, that would be a bit backwards. Washington should be compared to Poitier. (although, really, in a world where race doesn't matter we probably shouldn't even have a subcategory like African-American actor, just actor.) It's amazing how bumbling the police are in this film. I can understand the racism, even if it gets a bit extreme at times -- some hoodlums assault Tibbs in front of the police chief. But at least three times the wrong man is arrested for the murder. How incompetent are these guys? Ignoring FBI evidence, incriminating people on circumstantial issues. What kind of town is this? Heat of the Night is considered one of the greatest films ever made -- the American Film Institute ranks it in the top 100. I'm unsure how to rank a top 100 list, but I don't find this film's inclusion unfair. It certainly is a richly-plotted story with good characters and plenty of cultural significance. If that's something you'd be interested in, check it out.

Renowned actors Poitier (to sir with love) and Steiger (The pawnbroker) star as different styled detectives and capture audience's attention through Steiger's Oscar nominated performance and the sheer brilliance of Poitier's very serious character. It is often slow moving, allowing audiences to engage deep within the central plot about a conventional murder in the crime genre, an unknown killer in the city. However the movie works extraordinarily well with these two central protagonists and their input is fantastic. Their relationship is definitely worth watching for the tension, surprises and excitement as the two mark their differences about each other. The narrative was definitely Oscar deserving and it beat off the competition for 5 Oscars in 1968.Characters.Poitier's serious character is one of the best I have ever seen. The way he acts to portray a character who is concerned, clever, devious, friendly, committed is outstanding. His serious mode of address is remarkable. The character has an edge about him which makes Poitier so brilliant in this role, his facial expressions are amazing.Issues.At the time of release it was common for racism to be apparent in society. If you watch it these days I'm sure your jaw will drop. I was amazed how heavy the film centralised itself on such, what now, is a very delicate issue. I was spellbound by the use of terminology in the police force as the police tried to accept Poitier. But the terms are really disgusting, but I suppose it gives an accurate display of what life was like for black residents in society in the late 60's.watch it if...you enjoy the conventional murder mystery plots and actors who give their all to portray meaningful characters.8.5/10 "},{"Title":"In the Heat of a Great Movie","Date":"30 April 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" First things first, here is the film's plot Virgil Tibbs is a Philadelphia Homicide detective home to see his mother in the rural south.

It's not surprising, however, as I found this MGM movie to be more than just an ordinary murder mystery.  The movie takes place in 1960s Sparta, Mississippi.  It is the story of a black police officer (Sidney Poitier) from Philadelphia who must work with the local white Chief of Police (Rob Steiger) to catch a murderer.  I enjoyed the fact that the movie not only utilizes the suspense of a murder mystery, but it also shows the struggle for each officer to put aside his differences in order to work together.  Though Rod Steiger won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Chief Bill Gillespie, I feel that Sidney Poitier was equally deserving of this award.  Through his superior acting, Poitier brought the character of Mr. Tibbs to life. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The essence of both Gillespie and Tibbs stayed in my mind long after the film was over.  I thought the conclusion of the movie not only wrapped up the mystery, but also completed the development of the characters.  For me, the soundtrack was memorable, including the Ray Charles song with the same title as the movie, and some rock and roll music, a novel idea for the time.  I thought that the metaphors in the movie were great, carefully planted so to be picked up only by the most observant viewer.  The protective glasses Gillespie wears most of the movie symbolize his inability to see clearly in other aspects of his life. This and other less obvious metaphors enhanced the film, making it more than just a murder mystery, but in my opinion, a four(out of five)-star film.

('Guess Who's Coming to Dinner') In the Heat of the Night', directed by Norman Jewison in 1967 and starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger as policemen from either side of the Mason-Dixon line fits in more with that 'in-between' category.Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), while waiting in the bus depot of a small town in Mississippi is detained by the local police after the town's wealthiest businessman is found dead on the street. After he is brought into the station and essentially arrested, Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger, who won one of the film's several Oscars for his acting) learns that Virgil Tibbs actually happens to be a police detective from Philadelphia, who was visiting his mother during his vacation. The racial profiling and racism that brought Tibbs in is echoed throughout the film and while he (at first) reluctantly helps Gillespie solve the case before heading back up north, he puts his life at risk simply by remaining in the town.'In the Heat of the Night' won several Oscars, including Best Picture in 1968, and is certainly a good film. I can see why it won its awards back then, and why it has earned a spot on many film lists &#150; it is a good solid picture, and a safe one at that. Of course, there is some excuse for the film's safeness; it was made in the late 1960's during the center of the Civil Rights movement, and being a mainstream film, it is not going to have overtly inflammatory moments. I can't help but feel, however, that I have seen films that are its peer ('Guess Who's Coming to Dinner', also starring Poitier) or even predecessor ('Gentleman's Agreement') that took more chances and as a result were more impactful. Unfortunately, while the race relations were not presented in an extreme fashion, they were present enough for me to focus on that and not really even care about the actual murder investigation &#150; when the murderer was revealed it was kind of a big 'so what' for me.For what it was, however, 'In the Heat of the Night' was indeed a good film which was bolstered by some incredible performances. One cannot imagine two other actors in these roles, they so absorb their characters. Poitier is as dignified and intelligent as ever, and when he proclaims one of the film's most famous lines 'They call me MISTER Tibbs!' you know he means business. Steiger's Chief Gillespie is a redneck, and he's sly &#150; but he's not stupid, and not without feeling. Under Jewison's decent direction, the editing work by Hal Ashby, who later went on to direct 'Shampoo' and one of the all-time great cult films, 'Harold and Maude' provides some good pacing to the film. It's a safe enough film to recommend to most, but don't look for anything overly ground-breaking here. 7/10--Shelly "},{"Title":"Tense and surly drama","Date":"31 March 2002","Score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" A clash of identities between a black big-city detective and an overweight white sheriff down in the bigoted South. A murder brings them together (that, and some story contrivances), but as a mutual admiration begins to develop we see all different shades of humanity. It's a picture designed to show off hot-headed emotions, and Rod Steiger (in an Oscar-winning performance) is the perfect actor to pull this off with his silly yellow-tinted shades and crooked policeman's cap, he's an outdated cartoon, but one with an underlying sense of sadness and self-loathing. Sidney Poitier straightens him out, he and the rest of the town. Easy to see why Poitier was such a hero to audiences of this era (of any color) he pulls no punches, and the prickly reminder of his race isn't a nagging issue. Like all character-oriented dramas that strive for something extra, this isn't much of a murder-mystery; however, as an acting piece it's first-rate. ***1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Interesting, but Slow Moving","Date":"3 December 2001","Score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  I think I expected something a little more heavy handed and cut and dry along the lines of Mississippi Burning, but In the Heat of the Night turned out to be much more subtle.  There are no speeches and really no moments of truth.  Poitier and Steiger wisely play their characters as complicated, multi-dimensional people rather than the stereotypes they might have become in a lesser film.  Tibbs is both aloof and seething while Gillespie is neither a bigot nor saint.Unfortunately, the mystery angle is unsatisfying, and the solution is arbitrary (It's a perfect example of film critic Roger Ebert's Economy of Characters rule, which states that no one is introduced into a film without having to serve *some* purpose).  I know the killing was only a catalyst for everything that came after, but equal attention could have been focused on both the murder and everything that happens because of it (e.g., Chinatown).  I also found the movie's pacing to be excruciatingly slow, especially the first half an hour.

However,this picture came out during a time of one of the most turbulant times in American history and the overall struggle for Civil Rights and at a time when America itself was confronted with its own racism including the escalating saga in Vietnam,and it also focus on the status of the black man in particular as an individual in his own right.Based on the John Ball's novel of the same title,the story takes place in a sleepy little town in Mississippi where the sweltering conflict of racism is found everywhere and it shows during the first twenty minutes of the movie. Sidney Poitier stars as Virgil Tibbs,a young black policeman from Philadelphia who ends up in the small town of Sparta who happens to be the suspect in a grisly murder and is arrested just because he is black. When police chief Bill Gillespie(played by Rod Steiger in the role that won him the Oscar for Best Actor in 1967) learns that Poitier is an police officer and not only that a homicide detective,he enlists his help.However,Virgil is relectant but knows that he is likely the only man who can piece the clues together and solve this complicated case and catch the criminals who did this and bring them to justice. But that will not be easy for our young detective since he has to confront complete bigotry and straight up hatred at every turn not to even mention having his own life hanging in the balance and some dealings with the town mob. Not only that but in turn having Gillespie there for help and every turn to catch a deadly killer.However,there are some fine performances here that makes this film worth seeing. Poitier's portrayal of Virgil Tibbs is excellent and Steiger's portrayal of Bill Gillespie is brillantly portrayal and it shows just by watching these two actors go and it in the prime of their careers. Also straight support performances from Warren Oates and Lee Grant as well. The film itself is overall brillant because of the risk-taking elements that are exposed here and it is handled nicely due to some of the subject matter that is present throughout the film. The direction,and the screenplay are nowadays a standard classic. The film's theme song sung by the great Ray Charles is a wonder to behold and the score by Quincy Jones is superb. A great film that needs to seen again all the way around just to show how different as human beings we can be in hopes of working together in a time of great need. Catch it sometime on either on home video or later on TCM(Turner Classic Movies). Five Stars.

The story is average but there are a great number of exciting moments. The film is focused on what the filmmakers wanted to show. There are no unnecessary details. It keeps you into the subject and the location all the time. The acting by all was fairly OK. The way they showed a Black police officer working in an environment where no one wants him, gives a feeling how they all were treated back then. The charm of the film is the depiction of a white police officer taking help from a black one. CONS The way the white police officers were shown was unimpressive. They were shown coming to conclusions without even thinking a little bit. May be it was done to show that Virgil was smart. But this type of comparison looks cheap.
