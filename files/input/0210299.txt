Aidan Quinn, who I could take or leave in previous performances delivers a masterful performance, in my opinion. Janet Mcteer whose character is the glue, holding the story together, also justifies her selection for this role.                                             But the revelation of the film, is the performance of Pat Carroll as Viney Butler. If this isn't Academy Award level acting then I haven't learned anything in over fifty years of filmgoing.                          The only way I remember her, is as a sometime guest on the Jack Paar show. I have not seen her act ever. I had no idea I was watching Pat Carroll untill I glanced at the box the video came in. I was incredulous! Completely gone was any characteristic of Pat Carroll, and in her place was this mountain woman, surviving for about seventy years in an enviornment that would give most of us nervous breakdowns.               Pat, this role is truly your magnum opus! God bless you.

Every beat and word represents something that in many ways is so personally related to people's lives, history and emotions.This is the lovely story of Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer) a preeminent teacher musician who impulsively decides to run to visit her sister at a struggling rural school in the Appalachia, right after being denied of an anticipated promotion where she teaches. Over there (in the mountains) she founds a new meaning to her life by finding love and discovering very culturally important Scott-Irish ballads that she might use to save her promotion.The whole cast performances are awesome, especially Janet McTeer who comes back with another tremendous performance and Aidan Quinn who hasn't been this good so far. Writer/director Maggie Greenwald gives us a very fresh and tender story that describes so well all characters, situations with the very real and touching concept of music.Finally, but not the least, David Mansfield music is fantastic. He amazingly takes excellent care of every musical detail related to the lives of these beautiful characters.Robinson Almanzar.

That's a question that many people throughout the ages have asked. There is no question in the mind of Tom Bledsoe (Aidan Quinn). Life is for enjoying. His idea of enjoying is playing music and drinking corn liquor. I don't know if I can argue with that.Neither could Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer), Doctor of Musicology, who came up into the mountains to visit her sister Elna (Jane Adams), and discovered music that had not been heard by outlanders in hundreds of years. Songs that were originally written in Ireland and Scotland and hidden in the Apppalatian Mountains. She discovered that there was indeed culture among those whom the outlanders considered ignorant, inbred hillbillies, and she was determined to capture and share that culture.In the process, she learned what life was really all about. It was a beautiful, tender story about people and differences; like the reaction over the discovery of her sister's partner, Harriet (E. Katherine Kerr).The music was awesome, and this was Emmy Rossum's first movie. I loved her in The Phantom of the Opera, The Day after Tomorrow, and Mystic River; and now add another great performance to the list. I wasn't inclined to see Posiden, but I will make it a point now to see her again.I have to end with a note about Pat Carroll, who played Viney Butlet. Her career is is old as i am and I am sure that I have probably seen her many times over the years and not known who she was. I will not forget now, as she was the most interesting character in the movie. Brava!

It's reproduced with great authority, and a lot of chestnuts which haven't been heard in Pop culture since Joan Baez are played much as they must have been when first heard Matty Groves, Barbry Allen, I Wish I Was Single Again, etc. The castng overall is superb - Janet McTeer is a unique and believable presence; Pat Carroll delightful as a mountain matriarch; Aiden Quinn his charming, virile self.The plot is acceptable, if not 100% believable - several of the (discreet) sexual situations peppered throughout seem much colored by modern attitudes. Especially the reckless bit of carelessness which leads to one of the key catastrophes in the film. And these backwoods people are just a LITTLE too understanding on the issue involved.On the other hand, several obvious threads veer into surprising directions - the ending being one of them.

Director and writer Maggie Greenwald later in the film interjects modern subplots that only serve the audience to rail against the obviousness of those ideas. The things that I liked about this film are the beautiful cinematography of the Appalachian mountains that really enhance the realistic quality of the film and of course the music. The music is the central ingredient in this story and the Scottish and Irish ballads add an indelible flavor that really make it the primary reason to view this film. In fact, musicians Taj Mahal and Iris Dement have roles in this film. Janet McTeer is well cast as Lily the musicologist that is recording these songs. This is definitely a better performance than her Oscar nominated role in a very mediocre and totally overrated film called Tumbleweeds. She adds intelligence and strength to her character and its vital to the film. The things that I feel hurt the film are the romance between Lily and Tom (Aidan Quinn). It comes out of left field and is never really believable. And then their is the lesbian romance between Lilys sister and her coworker who are teachers. This is where the film wanders off into another direction and the main focus of the film gets lost. We really didn't need these contrivances added to the story and it hurts the film. Not a bad film but the story and focus seem to go into another area. Too bad!

It's kind of like an indie, female version of Oh Brother Where Art Thou, but with a feminist touch and more and better music. The film is very enjoyable with some exceptional acting particularly in the case of Janet McTeer, Aidan Quinn and Emmy Rossum and features some lovely and moving renditions of classic ballads. Maggie Greenwald (The Ballad of Little Jo, for which she wrote and directed) is also both the director and writer of Songcatcher and she has done a fabulous job. The film's focus is on musicologist Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer) in the early 1900s who has just been passed over for a permanent teaching position for the second time. She becomes embittered and decides to leave the school and go to the mountains to visit her sister (Jane Adams) at her school in the mountains of North Carolina. There she learns, to her delight, that many of the old Irish/Scottish ballads have been preserved in their original form, after hearing them sung by her sister's warden Deladis Slocumb (the always delightful Emmy Rossum). After hearing Deladis sing these ballads Lily becomes obsessed with collecting and publishing the songs. With the help of Deladis and her boyfriend Fate Honeycutt (don't you just love these names) Lily goes around the mountain collecting songs. One of her first stops is at incorrigible Viney Butler (Pat Carroll). While she's there Lily meets Viney's grandson Tom Bledsoe (a nearly unrecognizable Aidan Quinn). The two clash at first but they eventually become, no surprise, romantically involved. Along the way we also meet Lily's antagonist Earl Giddens (David Patrick Kelly) who's has been 'educated' down the mountain and wants to turn the mountain in a coal mine. While collecting the songs, Lily slowly begins to crack from her shell and she learns to love the people of the mountain. The photography in the film is spectacular. It's vibrant and bright with some terrific shots of the wizardly Carolina Mountains. Maggie Greenwald brings the beauty of the mountains out with long-range shots at sunset. As I stated earlier the acting in this film is superb so there are no complaints from me. Lily Penleric was played perfectly by Janet McTeer who seems to be able to convey so much emotion through her eyes. Tom Bledsoe was such a different character than I had ever seen Aidan Quinn play before and it was quite refreshing. He was great as a grumbling, dirty yet somehow attractive mountain man. And Emmy Rossum, in her feature film debut, gives a stunning performance as the angelic voiced ward.The music in the film is probably it's best asset. Greenwald had actual singers and musicians play the musical parts. Iris Dement and Taj Mahal were just two of the musicians in this film and they added an authenticity to the film. All the songs in this movie were amazing and as soon as I saw this film I went out and bought the soundtrack. The only problems I had with the film are that the plot sometimes seemed a little forced, a little contrived and that there were too many subplots. There were probably in total about seven or eight different plot lines weaved in and out throughout the film. In some films this might work but Greenwald doesn't quite pull it off. The lesbian subplot was not needed at all. It actually took away from the authenticity of the film and didn't seem to fit in with the time period, which was the late Victorian era. Overall I would definitely recommend this movie, especially to those that really enjoyed movies like Oh Brother Where Art Thou. This film captivates the beauty of the Carolina Mountains and shows what the music of the mountains is really like.

Fed up with that, she quits and goes to the mountains of North Carolina to see her younger sister who teaches school in the backwoods.As soon as she arrives, she finds the mountain folk full of old ballads, which they call 'love songs'. As she hears them, she recognizes many as originating in England 200 or 300 years earlier. Evidently they have been passed down from mothers and grandmothers.Lily gets a fresh inspiration and decides that all these ballads need to be recorded and published. Some shorter ones she is able to record on an Edison machine with wax cylinders. Others she must just listen to and record lyrics and music on paper.Emmy Rossum, classically trained singer ('Phantom, 2004) and about 13 during filming, is Deladis Slocumb, who sings many of the songs for Lily.Aidan Quinn is Tom Bledsoe, local who had been educated off the mountain, but returned there for the simple life and making music.The movie captured my attention and my imagination from the very first scenes.

They didn't TALK about sex during Victorian times, but they sure had it! I had no difficulty believing that two women living together in an environment so foreign to their upbringing would develop a closeness which would lead to a physical relationship. The traditional music was wonderful, but David Mansfield's original score was incredible. My family has lived in the mountains of West Virginia since the sixteen hundreds, there is a family cemetery on the side of a mountain in the woods. Mansfield's And the Mountains Cried playing while the coffin was carried up the hill showed me something that could have been a picture from my family's past. It moved me so much that I sent him an email, telling him what an impact his music, especially that song, made . To my surprise, he replied, thanked me, and included the lyrics.I loved this film. Wonderful music, beautiful costumes, humor, lust, rebellion, murder, and you can't beat the beauty of the location.

Excellent performances by Janet McTeer and Aidan Quinn. Maggie Greenwald writes and directs in a slightly less than even-handed effort. The lesbian scenes are more distracting and not original.They do little more than provide filling , for a story that has the potential for having a deeper layered meaning.Some stereotypes are avoidable, like hillbillies who use fire to purge their demons,like we destroy what we do not accept mentality. Pat Carroll (Viney Butler) is perfect as the mountain matriarch, whom the movie could have showcased, as she can carry the load of the world on her shoulders. All in all, even with the flaws, the music,(if you like country-hillbilly lyrics with a Scottish-Irish origin ), can catch your ear , and there is enough emotion between the two main characters to make a difference.

Fantastic, wonderful.  The singers and other performers were excellent, and serve as a reminder of the great music that comes out of the mountains.The movie, however, fails to inspire.  My impression of the film was that the writer/director wanted to make a movie about mountain music, and proceeded to write dramatic filler.  As opposed to O Brother, Where Art Thou?, where the movie was as entertaining as the music, the drama seems to go nowhere.One of the subplots, about two lesbians inhabiting the mountain, doesn't seem to have much of a point at all, other than to bring about the ending that the writer wanted.  The coal mining company plot was dropped about half-way through the movie.  Some scenes - such as when Emmy Rossum's character gets proposed to - seem forced and don't work.  In fact, the best way to summarize the dramatic tension in this movie is forced; characters do things that they seem to smart to do, just to push the plot along. Examples include the lesbians making love right along a trail, Rossum's boyfriend through most of the movie, or even McTeer's relationship with a married man.  I'm reminded of Bela Lugosi's famous line Pull the string! Pull the string!Janet McTeer's character starts out cold; in fact, the actress excels at this to the point that we're wondering if this is why the school doesn't want her to begin with.  She's condescending, and while the writer obviously intended for her to warm up during the course of the movie, McTeer doesn't follow through.  As a result, our protagonist remains distant throughout the work; her relationship with Aidan Quinn doesn't even make much sense, as he seems a bit too alive to want a relationship with someone that cold.  It's unfortunate, since the rest of the actors do a very good job, especially Pat Carroll.My recommendation is to rent the movie and fastforward, stopping during the singing scenes.

It moved me more than any film I saw this last series. I have to admit I come from some Appalachian roots on my dad's side, but only knew of the harshness, as the music wasn't played in our home. Growing up in the DC/Baltimore area we were the logical place for Bluegrass and so-called mountain music to migrate, and I've heard it for most of my life. I started listening to it more intently after being influenced by the late Ralph Rinzler, acclaimed musicologist and creator of the Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife.The film gets jump started by the knee-jerk reaction of an esteemed musicologist who was yet again turned down for tenure -- clearly based on her gender. Her life's work is the folk music of the British Isles and when her departure from academia takes her to her sister's school in western North Carolina she is immediately presented with her music in this backwards environment. Imagine her surprise. She then turns on her academic engines and decides to collect and publish this wondrous music of the Appalachians.She is taken to Songcatchers, or the people who are the preservers of this oral legacy, to learn the songs. It takes her some effort to win their trust, but she gets a recommendation from Pat Carroll's character which gets her through skeptical doors. It takes her a long time to be truly accepted into the community and finally as a songcatcher herself. There are about 20 songs performed and I felt they were the true foundation for the film. The drama is always invigorated by them.Many reviews are critical of the stereotypical characters, but there actually were rich do-gooders who made public displays of educating the mountain savages and evil coal and lumber company operatives who swindled the illiterate landowners. This film's coal company character might seem oversimplified, but he also initiates the most riviting moment of the film when he starts singing O Death, which is completed by the legendary Hazel Dickens. This moment brought tears to my eyes.If I have a complaint about this film, it's a little too busy. It tries to deal with lesbianism, untrustworthy men, distrustful and violent mountain people, the harshness of the land and life, a male-dominated community and the music. A couple of these, perhaps the first two, could have been sacrificed to make the rest of the film stronger. This in no way makes the film weak, just that it has room to improve. The performances of Janet McTeer and Pat Carroll stand out, and Aiden Qiinn was good as the mountain man who had seen the world. The musical performances of Emmy Rossum, Iris Dement and Hazel Dickens made my heart soar.The film opens in Baltimore this week and I'll be there to see it again. The music is wonderful and worth the trip just for that. I only wish there was more of Emmy Rossum and the other music with that Appalachian edge on the soundtrack CD, as opposed to the more highly produced songs by more famous people, whose voices/characters did not appear in the film.

Greenwald wisely gives her vocalist leads lots of rein.  Of course, Emmy Rossum's Deladis has an exceptional gift.  While her vibrant voice punctuates the entire film, Iris DeMent & Taj Mahal set a pace that perfectly accommodates their music and Greenwald's film.I disagree with (Uncoming Movies critic) Greg Dean Schmitz's review that the film contains a few stereotypes that don't do the rest of the film justice.  Instead of a typical happy ending in which the woman throws away her life for marriage, Lily doesn't choose between career and family. Instead, she takes charge of her life and takes her man and adopted child down the mountain to launch a new career based on earning money while she spreads folk music throughout the the industrialized world.  Dolly Parton's ballad over the ending credits serves as proof that the mountain teachers, Lily's prototypes, were successful. Instead of returning to academia, where Lily had been marginalized, she offers her research & sources on a silver platter to a full-of-bluster-authority-on-everything colleague so he can unlearn his bombastic ways.  She directs him up the mountain to an old woman of her acquaintance (Pat Carroll's Viney Butler), who unlike our city-folk heroes, remains as unchanged as ever.

Besides, this part of the Southern Appalachians known as the Blue Ridge is famous for its rich and varied gemstones and minerals, even today. The incredible coal veins are found in western Virginia and Kentucky.Unfortunately, there are a number of inconsistencies. The accents are pretty strongly Tennessee. Emmy did a great job of following the dialect coach but the twang was too strong, the nasality maybe not strong enough, and the diphthongs too broad and even. The music director made it clear that he thought there were African-American influences in mountain music. There are not. He got a lot of it right, but he didn't know what to call Old Time music (that's what it's called by outlanders) and called clogging flat-foot dancing. But he got a lot else about the music right. The ending 'flip' of ballad phrases is too strong in most of the songs. One singer got it exactly right -- Bobby McMillon, who was the second to sing part of the Conversation with Death. And what's this with Dolly Parton? In the DVD, she's proud to have been a part of it, but she's not in the credits, but she is the soundtrack listing. I'm confused.I have questions! As far as I was concerned, this could have been a documentary about the music. Why invent a woman to take the part of the collector? Even Greenwald admits this is a fantasy at that time. Forcing an Edison cylinder maker and all the paraphernalia that goes with it into the story is, well, deeply forced and unbelievable. Why add a lesbian romance? If there were such a thing, it would have been hidden so deep the subplot police could never have found it. The panther story about shedding of clothes -- true. They're all but extinct now. Moonshine? True, I've tasted some in Hot Springs. (Raw tasting and it burns!) But it doesn't come out the still like tap water as shown in the scene. The romance that developed between Tom and Lily is totally unbelievable within the scope of the story. The rich coal mine owner and his stooge would never have offered to buy land because there is no coal to mine. They cut out part Taj Mahal's playing. Black people were a rarity in the mountains and they took this chance to illustrate that, so why cut it short? (I guess they had to cut something.) Did you notice the mailman? Do you really believe that some poor mail carrier trudged up the mountain to deliver mail? If they wanted the mail, they went down to the post office to get it, or it didn't get got -- at least until Rural Free Delivery (RFD) was implemented.The hardest part of all to accept was that nowhere in this film did they find time for even one complete ballad. But I still enjoyed this film because it means well and it gets a lot of what of it started out to do right, though it veers off track a good bit. I had relatives in Weaverville and Leicester and attended school at Mars Hill College in Madison County, the site of the 'discovery' of many of the songs.

While it isn't hard to find a film such as the former, the latter is becoming more and more rare as audiences have gradually created the stereotype that they want their movies force-fed to them. And perhaps the fact that Songcatcher -- a flawed but superior drama -- was a failure at the box office just solidifies this stereotype, but I think its poor success can be more fully attributed to the fact that it wasn't advertised enough. Maybe this is a good thing, because --  afterall -- heavy advertisement tends to ruin a picture's reputation. And even if Songcatcher WAS shown in a greater amount of theaters, people would be more likely to choose the latest action blockbuster over this little indie gem. But, then again, you never know. Personally, I think that audiences have become greatly underestimated in the past few years -- which is just one of the many issues addressed in this film -- and that more movies such as this one would be made easily available to the public. But enough sermonizing for a mere film critique; let's discuss Songcatcher. The story is of a determined teacher (played superbly by Janet McTeer) who is passed over for a full-time teaching job that is instead assigned to a man. Tired of this sexist environment, she moves up into the Appalachian mountains to live with her sister (also a teacher, played by Happiness's Jane Adams), her sister's partner (E. Katherine Kerr; Children of a Lesser God), and their adopted student (Emmy Rossum). But when she learns that the mountain-people -- unbeknownst to themselves -- hold in their memory the words and melodies of rare Scotch-Irish folk songs, she decides to collect them for publishing. While most comply with her endeavors, one particular musician (Aidan Quinn) becomes concerned that she will exploit their music instead of honor it as she intends. At first glance it may seem like the central message of Songcatcher involves the exploitation of small town people by larger corporations, but its true meaning is much more complex. Songcatcher deals with art in general, its importance and its effect. For the mountain-people, these songs are possibly the only thing keeping them sane; regardless of the bad things that happen in their lives (including the forced sale of property, unfaithful spouses, and the persecution of just about anything different), they know that they will always have music as an outlet for their emotions. Are McTeer's honorable intentions going to take this away from them? It is a complicated issue -- more-so than it might appear --  and the end doesn't really offer one specific answer. But I appreciated the fact that it at least posed the question. There are many other issues addressed by film-maker Maggie Greenwald in Songcatcher women's rights, homosexuality, and chauvinism are all given intelligent (and honest) representation. If I have one beef with the picture, it's that it doesn't take more time to explore these topics more fully. Running a little shy of two hours, Songcatcher had enough material to fill an entire additional sixty minutes (which is rare, seeing as how most movies are TOO extensive). Also, there are some scenes in the film that just don't seem to fit, such as an irrelevant subplot involving jungle cats. But set aside these minor blemishes and you have an impressive film that is as entertaining as it is smart. Songcatcher opens with a formal piano performance of the classic English folk song, Barbriallen, and it's only appropriate that it ends with a modern interpretation of it. It shows the value of art and how the best of it lasts for ages; hopefully, Songcatcher will prove to be as timeless as its music.Grade A- "},{"Title":"Don't preach to the choir","Date":"25 January 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Music","Review":"  I liked the idea of this film, but the folks behind it didn't make a film so much as a smug string of sermons.

There are, however, two valuable aspects to the film. One is the music which Lomax collected and which is now preserved in the Alan Lomax Collection at the Library of Congress in Washington and to a considerable extent on recordings drawing upon that collection, The other redeeming feature is Emily Rossum, 14 at the time, a delicate beauty with a wonderful voice. I wish the movie had made more use of her voice in presenting the music instead of having it sung by folks representing the local population. Of course, what Lomax did in part was to record the songs sung by people with not very good voices. Much of the music sung by Pete Seeger, among others, is drawn from the work Lomax did (which also included collecting folk music from Europe). The film is correct in asserting that the music of Appalachia can be traced to its roots in Scotland and England and that, in many cases, the Appalachian versions are purer than contemporary versions still sung in Britain. But lots of singers have also recorded the same ballads (like Barbra Allen) in their Scottish or English versions. The music is sometimes identical but the words are frequently somewhat different. The brief period when folk music was highly popular in the United States was filled with Appalachian folk music performed by artists like Joan Baez and Judy Collins, the Weavers and many others. Seeger was one of the Weavers, the group which might be said to have launched the folk music boom. It's a fascinating history -- much, much, much more interesting than this lousy movie.

Nonetheless, as a background for presenting the music of Appalachia, Songcatcher works remarkably well.  Particularly effective is the music to accompany the natural-birth of Alice Kincaid's baby and O Death sung by various musicians after the Saturday dance. Appearing in both films, the presentation of O Death invites comparison to O Brother, Where Art Thou.  Where the Coen Brothers use this fulsome ballad to indulge themselves in a preposterous fantasy about lynching--how many blacks escaped a throng of klansman??--Songcatcher uses O Death as a coda to reinforce the movie's basic theme.  Paraphrasing Dr. Penleric's astute observation, for mountain people, these songs are the air you breath, as surely about death as they are also about life.  People close to the earth try to explain and celebrate both.  Having different verses sung by different musicians creates a kind of omniscient Greek chorus always mindful of god and/or nature's cruel ways.  Too bad the Coen brother didn't pursue their own metaphor.  In spite of the script, Songcatcher has some genuinely fine acting particularly Pat Carroll as the mountain crone and Aiden Quinn as her grandson.  Taj Mahal's Dexter Speaks was brilliant but the movie neither sets-up nor follows through with the implications of his presence on the mountain.

The film runs less then two hours, but in that time director Maggie Greenwald tries to make statements on women's rights, gay rights, intellectual property rights, the encroachment of big business on a small rural community, and respect for indigenous cultures.  Add to that a jealous mistress, a difficult childbirth, a couple of condescending swells from the city, and a country boy that's turned his back on his roots, and the mountain folk of Songcatcher start to feel like the cast of a soap opera, with everyone undergoing a unique and interesting crisis.The basic premise, though, is a good one.  Dr. Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer), a professor of music in the early 20th century, gets fed up dealing with the male-dominated world of academia and literally heads for the hills, where her sister Elna runs a school with another woman (her lover, we later learn).  There Lily discovers something that excites her British and Scottish folk songs, passed down by oral tradition for nearly 200 years.  With the aid of a phonograph and the frequently bemused help of the locals, she works to record and publish her findings, while coal barons and their lackeys try to take the land and rugged mountain man Aidan Quinn watches first with disapproval, then with admiration.There's the makings of a good story here, in the historically-based recording of folk music and the growing respect Lily has for the mountain community.  The film is best when people are singing those old songs, filled with love and sorrow and death, turning the age-old airs into their own personal catharsis.  The cast is generally strong--I particularly liked Pat Carroll as Quinn's hardy grandmother--but they are weighed down by a script that tries to cover too much ground, not allowing us any time to really care for the characters or their troubles.  We see the initial shock of Lily discovering her sister's little secret, but very little of the struggle she must have undertook to accept it.  The affection which blossoms between Quinn and McTeer happens so fast, it gives us whiplash.  And the ending happens too quickly, and ties everything up far too neatly to be really satisfactory.

A bodice-ripper of the most simple-minded and soppy kind.It's not just that the love story at its heart, that between Reece  and Dr. Lily Penleric is more than a tad unbelievable.

You take the stereotypical tight laced music professor, put her into the stereotypical hillbilly environment, everyone reacts to each other as expected, and they suddenly go from dramatic situations to unheartedly bursting into song. There were weak attempts at social statements, and while the music seemed to be well researched, everything else was done minimally.  The setting and current issues seemed to be pulled out from no more than 4 or 5 pages from a highschool history textbook.  Also, the acting left a lot to be desired. You go from the professor and her romantic interest demonstrating that they have nothing in common and completely differ in their ideals, to them kissing in a field.  You have him wholeheartedly sticking to the hills mentality and values, no character progression, to suddenly choosing to move off the mountain with her.  She may not sacrifice her interests in this film, but he totally does so as far as his are concerned.The ending, I did not find to be predictable at all.  However, I did consider it disappointing.  She makes a statement toward the end of the film, that you can't appreciate the value of the music when you remove the from it the context.  She appreciates the wonderful nature of the music, that it relates to these peoples' daily lives, at both good and bad times. I could have understood her returning to school, but the decision she did make seems to be focused on as much on capitalism as it does a true love for the music.  I can see her wanting to spread the music, but a person who has a true love for it, wants to experience it as much as she wants to document it or make money off it.  She remains a square through all of this film, and never does fit into the free spirit on the hill mentality.  Even taking this into consideration though, it seems like a good character progression would have brought her from being straight laced, to having a true appreciation for the music, its history, and its expression of the daily lives of these people that haven't changed much over 200 years.  She could have easily remained in the hills, have made a living, and could have had a lot more fulfilling and less superficial of an existence than the one she chose.The music of this film is wonderful and comes highly recommended.

I can understand their opinion when they say the other characters understand too well for the time.However, just because gay activity is very open today, how does the viewer of today know for sure what the mountain folk knew at that time period? Just because in the preaching scene no one quoted Leviticus 1822 or Leviticus 2013, doesn't mean they didn't know.I am sure they would be more likely to be offended and do harm to someone back then than now. There have always been mean people and some have always used religion as their excuse for it.What was the time period anyway 1900 and what? I believe I saw a model T Ford at the end. They were built 1908 through 1927. The wax cylinder recorder built 1888 through 1929, but most popular in 1910 through 1915.What war was Tom a veteran of? Did they actually say? That would have been another good historical landmark if they did.Overall it was a good story as well as the music.

Jane Fonda was much better in both Electric Horseman (another uptight woman finding sex in the mountains) and The Dollmaker (another cultural discovery of Appalachian arts) to this trumped-up plot with an odd ending.I'm sympathetic to the casting difficulties of an indie director as to why the other actors are about half the physical size of McTeer so that some scenes literally have to be shot on a mountainside so the other characters can have a face-to-face conversation with the towering actress. The audience couldn't help but laugh when McTeer was referred to as the actress' Jane Adams' big sister. Aidan Quinn, one of my favorite actors, is playing a similar role as in The Playboys; hey that's worth my admission money.But the soundtrack is the reason to see the movie. Iris DeMent should keep her day job, but it is nice to see and hear her in a cameo. She's featured with a Watson who is a natural actor (and fiddle player). Taj Mahal has an even briefer cameo. I recognized Hazel Dickens in another brief cameo (though I was just reading an article that O Death was written by Ralph Stanley and is not a traditional song so her moving rendition doesn't really fit in the movie.)

The music was great.  One could really feel the soul of these mountain people pouring forth through their songs.  What really captured the essence of the people was when Lily said that music is to them as breathing the air is to everyone else.  One can see that these primitive, backward white people were as in tune to nature and the universe just as the Indian tribes were that had resided in America more than 100 years prior to the setting of this film. This movie does have a typical Hollywood love affair with the homosexual life style.  And it is a little bit feminist leaning.  In one scene, Lily rebukes her love interest as being like all the other men on the mountain, only wanting to sit around all day and play music.  That seems odd and inconsistent coming from a music professor who in every other scene shows an intense love and fascination for music. Even though this film is hard on the menfolk, what makes it a delight is the way Lily is won over by the Mountain music and how she comes to appreciate the Mountain People and their peculiar ways.  That is the foundation of this movie.

An act which is both senseless and frustrating. But,this is the voice of experience. So many times the Bears have played primo football in the first half, only to have themselves collapse in the second. Sorry, but that's why I'm making the analogy. I've never watched a movie which triggered a similar emotional response. The first half, or thereabouts, of Songcatcher was sublime, and the second half collapsed as it tried to parlee with every cheesy Hollywood stereotype ever filmed.I've no idea what goes on in a Hollywood studio, but to me, it seems like this film was directed by either two people, or just one person trying to (possibly having to)please too many people at once. The movie began brilliantly as the stiff yet passionate Doctor bugged out due to her secondary status as a woman in a patricarchal academic system. We are then tranplanted, a bit abruptly, to the backwoods American mountains filled with beauty, spirit and song. The passion of the Doctor to collect these songs in the name of science is a bit unerving, but at least it shows she has character. However, her resolve is softened by her surroundings. Beautiful surroundings where the sublime music(Emmylou Harris, Iris Dement, Taj Mahal and Emily Rossum)completely transcends the ugly backwood and hillbilly stereotypes. Which is what the movie, I thought, was all about.Yet, as soon as we are fed, in retrospect, the gratuitous helping of local color, the film lapses into a cheesy, melodramatic passion play, albeit with a few weak variations on a theme. Suddenly, the music is lost and the characters become as flat as a KC and the Sunshine Band vinyl record. Characters, which were once well-formed, gel into homogenaity as though to get the damned thing over with as semi-convincingly as possible.And there you have it, a documentary about the first band ever to break out of anonymity to seek their fame and fortune in the big city - Songcatcher's tag line just might as well be The Decline of Western Civilation Pt. 3. Maybe I'm a curmudgeaon. But it's not my fault. Such a brilliant beginning raised the bar of expectations too high. I gave the movie a seven on the strength of that alone. Maybe it's true. Maybe writers and directers do, in order to be practical, have to sign their souls away to those Hollywood devils. I don't know. Might do the same thing myself. Unfortuneately, I'm in Illinois far from the maddening in-crowd. But it would be good to know if there was a compromise in the mix. I mean, how many chances to you get to see a movie with such a subject matter? How many times will you see Taj Mahal and Iris DeMent in a movie about the roots of folk music? Not many to none. In closing, Go Bears!

The performances were so exquisitely vital, you feel you're  in the room with the artists, and want to get up and dance with them, cry with them, laugh with them, run through the woods with them&#133;The storyline seems at first to be a bit of modern feminist revisionism, and there is some of that element present, however as the plot progresses, it becomes obvious that the director is giving  us not real people and a real story, but the same archetypes that are the defining elements of these ancient songsthe woman who must be won, the ardent and determined lover, their dance of passion, jealousy, false hope, untimely loss and death, sorrow and violence.  At the end,  you realize that the story is a song, too, and that it joins with the music to make a whole.  This is a well-cast film, with McTeer and Quinn giving well-rounded performances that lend support to an ensemble feeling.
