[{"Title":"Moore's finest Bond.","Date":"22 September 2001","Score":"50 out of 63 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  'For Your Eyes Only' starts the tenure of John Glen at the helm of the Bond series. He had worked previously on many of the Bond movies but during the eighties he directed all 5 Bond movies, and with the exception of 'A View To A Kill', they are up there with the best of the whole series. Certainly 'For Your Eyes Only' and the follow up, 'Octopussy' are the best of the Moore years, and I don't think it would be overstating it to say that Glen may have single handedly saved the franchise.By the end of the 1970s Bond had turned from Ian Fleming's masterspy  into an entirely comic book creation, culminating in the preposterous shenanigans of 'Moonraker' in 1979. At the start of a new decade a new style is clearly apparent, with a back to basics story that actually involves some spying, and a genuine threat to world peace. It's pushing it to say that the story is believable, but it is realistically told and is certainly a more adult affair than the previous efforts.The film starts with the final nail in the coffin for Blofeld. After years of legal wrangling over who had the rights to the character the filmmakers decided to show that they didn't need him anyway and unceremoniously dumped him once and for all. We are also immediately put in the mood for a far more serious Bond when he visits his late wife's grave, an unusual moment, not least because the movies rarely referenced previous actors in the role. Here we are reminded that Moore wasn't playing Bond at the time of his marriage. That serious tone pervades throughout the movie, with less wisecracking than usual, and a subdued villain, at odds with the expected megalomaniac we are used to. But the film is all the better for it. There are some fantastic action set-pieces including a chase in a Citroen 2CV, and a ski chase that tops even that of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', along with a tense finale that is literally a cliffhanger. Bond is actually forced to use his wits, and much of the action and escapes are less contrived than one would expect. It's also good to see (after 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and 'Moonraker') that the filmmakers have tried to get back to Fleming's Bond, with many ideas lifted from the original stories. The scene with Bond and Melina dragged behind the speedboat, for example, is taken directly from the novel of 'Live And Let Die', and many characters appear in Fleming's short story of the same name.Add to the mix a fine cast, notably Carole Bouquet as another strong character in the list of 'Bond women', and you have a satisfying and thrilling entry in the series. "},{"Title":"Roger Moore's best Bond hands down","Date":"11 April 2003","Score":"56 out of 81 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" After 1979's sci-fi cartoon called Moonraker, Albert Broccoli and the rest of the James Bond producers decided to change the pace for Roger Moore's fifth adventure. This included firing incumbent director Lewis Gilbert and writing a more believable plot, to begin with. The second item on the agenda was to write a script which curbed Roger Moore's obsessive tendencies to pile on the jokes. Add a few good villains and allies, and voila! a classic James Bond adventure there is. All right, maybe it was not that simple.This time around, Bond is sent to investigate the murder of one Timothy Havelock, who was working to salvage the wreckage of a spy boat carrying a vital command system called A.T.A.C. Bond's investigation leads him to believe that the Russians are also trying to recover the system, and may be using one Aris Kristatos (Julian Glover) to carry out their dirty work. Aiding Bond is the beautiful sharpshooter Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet) and an old acquaintance of Kristatos's named Milos Columbo (Topol).As good as it is, 'For Your Eyes Only' starts out terribly. The pre-title sequence involves an attempt on James Bond's life by a bald guy in a wheelchair with a white cat (I wonder who that could be?). The scene is campy and don't get me started on the remark about the delicatessen in stainless steel (obviously put in there at the request of some actor). I understand why the sequence was filmed, but that does not make it good. Thankfully it would not be a barometer on the rest of the movie!It may not be among the very best in the series, but believe me when I say that the difference in tone between this and the goofy 'Moonraker' is like day compared to night. It is easily the preeminent Roger Moore Bond film, and is well worth watching in every area. The villain is not trying to kill a majority of the human race for some outlandish purpose. There are no extravagant weapons or billionaire lunatics, no silly motives or doomsday schemes. Instead, we have a lean adventure that a Bond fan can actually enjoy. There are many outstanding qualities about this film, mixed in with a few notable negatives.Any list of what went right with this film has to begin with Roger Moore. After two mediocre performances, he really nails down the part here. He is courageous, commanding, tough, and, most importantly, serious, thanks to new director John Glen (who apparently had to do some prying to slow down Moore's humor blitz).Another BIG breath of fresh air is provided by the villains and allies, who are also treated seriously and given unusual depth of character. Julian Glover is exceptional as the ruthless and deceptive Kristatos. It is villains like this that help make the Bond series so great, and Glover is excellent indeed. No wonder Steven Spielberg cast him for Indiana Jones! In Topol, most famous for his work in 'Fiddler on the Roof', we get a terrific ally who has a great chemistry with Bond. I imagine I am not the only person who found him to be much like Kerim Bey in the great 'From Russia With Love'.Then there is the matter of the women, who both bring good and bad qualities to the table. Carole Bouquet is somewhat wooden as female lead, Melina, but can also hold her own when the heat is on, which makes her the best Bond girl in some time. Lynn-Holly Johnson provides a lovable portrayal as Bibi Dahl, a figure skater who gets the hots for Bond (don't get me started on the age difference). Her bubble headed character makes for some humorous moments and is used to make the character of Kristatos stronger. Dahl is also enrapturing to look at, but I find her ditzy part a little too over the top, but not to the point of weakening the final product.Unfortunately, there are a few items that bug me about this film. The first is Bill Conti's soundtrack. While it would be terrific literature for an up-tempo jazz band, it really clashes with the action more than anything. Another weakness is Roger Moore's lack of talent for fight choreography, which detracts from the action slightly. The last is Eric Kriegler (John Wyman), another invincible Oddjob rip-off that at one point picks up a motorcycle and hurls it at a fleeing Bond (!).This is all forgivable, however, because the action, from the mountainside ski chase to the climax atop a rock cliff, is of very high standards. The absurdity of the previous chapter is shed, and we get a highly entertaining adventure that appeals to fans and non-fans alike. I can certainly live with all of the flaws any day. So grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy another great 007 adventure.

Surprisingly this works very well, with the action sequences being more realistic (what with a car chase, ski chase and a small scale assault on the villain's residence instead), but brilliant too. For Roger Moore the film offers his best performance as James Bond. The puns are played down more here and while he does still have a little twinkle in his eye at times, his performance reflects more an older 007, a man who has lost his wife and is still fighting to save the world and right wrongs. This is demonstrated in the superb pre-title sequence in which after visiting his wife's grave, he is kidnapped by Blofeld (unofficially Blofeld however) and taken on a wild helicopter ride. The moment were he visits Tracy's grave sees Roger convey so much in one scene, he shows that he is not just the comedic 007, but he can be a serious one too. We see how the character has come to view revenge on Blofeld as he tells the dream like Melina (a beautiful and enchanting performance from Carole Bouquet) that before setting out on revenge as she hopes to do, she must first dig two graves. Some would see this as hypocrisy, whereas it is the words of a Bond who has come to analyse the hardship of a licence to kill.With Julian Glover portraying a more down to earth villain and the plot centering around the Cold War, For Your Eyes Only is a great 80's Bond film, with scatterings of what would be developed into the Timothy Dalton years, such as the serious Bond and the more down to earth story telling. Following on the heels of two of the biggest Bond films in terms of scope and financial success, For Your Eyes Only was a risk, but it worked. While it did not outgross Moonraker, it's financial intake was close and while it does possess the entertainment factor that both Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me did, it is an artistic success, with great performances, an engrossing storyline, wonderful characterization  and superb direction from John Glen in his directorial debut for a Bond film. He stages the abundance of chase scenes well and is helped by the fact that he has a good script to go with. On top of that Sheena Easton delivers a great theme tune.A great film and one deserving of classic status.

Although I've seen Dr. No, Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, The Man with the Golden Gun and others into the 1980's and 1990's (I haven't seen them all, though), I always preferred Indiana Jones as an action hero.  He bumbles and stumbles through his adventures and doesn't have any neat gadgets to help him escape.  Just a matter of personal choice.  I've never read an Ian Fleming James Bond novel and I know almost no Bond trivia.  However, I found For Your Eyes Only a very entertaining adventure that wisely, after the ridiculous Moonraker, brought James Bond down to earth.A Greek fishing trawler strikes a sea mine off the coast of Greece and sinks into the Mediterranean Ocean.  British intelligence is thrown into a panic.  Why?  Because the Greek fishing trawler was actually a British spy ship with a super secret code encryption device on board.  Enter 007 (Roger Moore), who must retrieve the device before Soviet KGB employed agents do.  Along the way, there will be double dealing, a young American Olympic skater (Lynn-Holly Johnson) with the teenage hots for Bond, an edge of your seat ski chase involving snowmobiles and high powered rifles, exploding burglar proof cars (a great bit of humor here!), tense cliff scaling, and underwater action.  All the elements of high Bond adventure is here, it's all fast paced by director John Glen and, believe it or not...believable.Here is a 007 adventure where we get a more human James Bond who must think his way through situations with almost no gadgetry.  It's amusing to watch James fend off the sexual advances and attempted seductions brought on Olympic skater Bibi in a twist of Bond's regular romantic life.  And best of all, the plot framework does not involve larger than life villains attempting to dominate the world through various diabolical (and unbelievable) schemes.  Here is a 007 mission straight out of the real world Cold War.  This story is grounded.I've read that director John Glen, recognizing the excesses of Moonraker, decided on this completely down to earth tone.  I've also read that For Your Eyes Only is the most debated about Bond film among fans of the series.  I don't know how much of the above is true, but I do know that For Your Eyes Only is a very enjoyable and down to earth adventure film.

The chase sequences, of course, standard fare, nothing spectacular or nail-biting. The Russians (or any dark, sinister force/country/covert agency) who want access to a secret code which has the ability to control underwater missiles, check. An impenetrable fortress atop a gigantic mountain/boulder/what-have-you, you betcha. A possible second love interest for Bond, another check. The only thing that is sorely lacking is a memorable villain, and in trying to humanize the bad guys, the creators have come up with people who aren't very interesting, or even ingenious. Julian Glover seems quite grey whenever he's on screen it almost makes me wish the writers hadn't disposed of Ernst Stavros Blofeld, or brought someone similar.And at over 120 minutes, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY runs a tad too long and doesn't maintain a level of mounting suspense necessary for this kind of movie, so when the end comes, it's a little more than a relief, not because this was a bad feature -- again, it wasn't -- but the fact that this ordeal was so perfunctory. And partly to this are the performances, which are wooden to say the least -- Carol Bouquet, while playing a tough girl, emotes little; Roger Moore repeats playing suave and his age is showing here; Lynn Holly-Johnson is irritating to no avail and her part could have been excised, but in a small role as a secondary Bond girl, Cassandra Harris brings an elegant presence in her brief moment of screen time. She should have had the larger part, since she does smolder, but oh well -- I'm complaining and the movie is a quarter of a century old and a classic. Just not a memorable one.

Sadly, this one did not perform as well as other Roger Moore James Bond movies as it did not do nearly as well as the previous film, Moonraker. I enjoyed this one more than Moonraker, which I did enjoy, but I felt it was a bit of a retread of The Spy Who Loved Me, while this one went in another direction by not having an eccentric wealthy person wishing to establish a new world order. At the same time, this one features action sequence after action sequence and location after location which made this one a fun romp. Perhaps it is the fact that this was not t he only Bond film released this particular year as Never Say Never Again featuring Sean Connery was put out the same year so it may have turned people off to see both. Me, I never cared to Never Say Never as it is simply a remake of Thunderball which is one of my favorite Sean Connery Bond movies. It and From Russia With Love via for the top spot for the Connery movies. I guess it matters little these days, and why should I care now that I alone think this is one of the best Bond films.The movie features a lot of action, but the mission is almost a rather unremarkable one. A spy ship is sunken with a mine and a decoder device that is on board is something that the Russians would love to have. The British have a man working on retrieving it, but he is promptly killed along with his wife in front of their daughter. James is sent in to find the hit-man responsible, but he soon finds a lot of people involved which takes him from one exotic location to another as he tracks down the one responsible for the death of the man charged with recovering the coding device. He will team up with the daughter whose parents were killed and soon try to salvage the device themselves; however, there is another who is after the device as well so he can sell it to the Russians.This one has so many action sequences in it that it goes by at supersonic speed. It opens with an action sequence in a helicopter that is unrelated to the decoding device plot, but it is fun to watch and the only time Blofeld and Roger Moore's Bond cross paths. There is an awesome car chase scene which features a very non typical Bond vehicle, a ski chase, a warehouse raid, a deep sea battle and a fight on a mountain monastery which has an awesome rock climbing scene. The Bond girls here are okay, just not as attractive as say Goodnight from Golden Gun or XXX from Spy. A lot of people complain about Bebe being to young for Roger, but he never shows any interest in her throughout the film so not sure why her character is criticized. She is just there to advance the plot in the Cortina portion of the film and to make Bond squirm a bit. The villain is good too as if you are watching it for the first time, you are not quite sure who the villain is until midway through the movie.So, no, this Bond is nothing like the previous two Bond movies which were very similar. Heck, it isn't even like Live and Let Die or Man with the Golden Gun either. It is not even like the next two Bond films. It stands on its own and is really fun to watch. I loved this one as a kid as it and Spy were tops for me at a young age too. This one I sometimes place on the top, because Spy is so similar to Moonraker; although, this one was supposed to follow Spy, but thanks to the space craze they decided to put Bond in space instead. I sometimes wonder had Moonraker not been made, if this film would have been vastly different as Jaws could very well had been in this one as he survived Spy and if there is no Moonraker where he turned good he could have showed up here to torment 007. So, while it is not apparently everybody's cup of tea, For Your Eyes Only stands near the top and is one of the more enjoyable and fast paced Bond films there is.

This scene provides a convenient rug to yank out from under the audience The film that we get is more straight serious than we might suspect, based on this introduction. So the beginning of this film really sets us up for a surprise. Out of all the Roger Moore Bond films, this one is most reminiscent of Connery's Bond. The violence repeatedly shows a mean, hard edge, and the joking (while there) is kept to a minimum. Guess what? This film works very nicely!There are a lot of things I liked about this one. The requisite special effects, models and stunts are there, but used to surprisingly subtle effect. The story is simple and small, and allows the film to focus on believable human character details. Carole Bouquet's vendetta-driven Melina Havelock is well-acted and believably serious. She's excellent. Character actor Michael Gothard (THE DEVILS, WARLORDS OF ATLANTIS) is very memorable as gun-for-hire Locque, who has no lines of dialogue whatsoever! Gothard delivers his performance entirely through visual expression. I imagine he must have had a wonderful time with this role, easily one of his best. Roger Moore's character, generally cool and under control, nonetheless grows impatient with Locque and seems to display some genuine, heartfelt anger when he finally...well, I don't want to spoil it, so you'll have to see the movie. Suffice it to say that it is one of my favorite the bad guy gets it moments in just about any movie.I also recall that when the film was new, the application of synthesizers in the music (most obvious in the title song, and more subtly applied in the score) was very cutting-edge and tasteful; there were clearly synthetic effects to be heard, but they were not poured on liberally.(Everything in moderation?) It's a little harder to notice in this day and age of synthetic everything, but the careful incorporation of obviously synthetic sounds lent extra style. (Take note of those moments involving the Dove pin.) It helped the film achieve a modern character, and is doubly interesting and appropriate because the action scenes do not depend primarily on high-tech gadgetry. All in all, a classy application of synthesizer. Maybe I'm going on about nothing here, but I remember noticing this quality when the film was new, and I've always liked it.So basically, without rambling on further, this film is good, and very enjoyable.

He must do so quickly because the Soviets are also in pursuit, and they appear to be aided by a wealthy shipping magnate.In spite of the gargantuan box office garnered by Moonraker, Albert Broccoli was hurt by criticism that it had strayed too far from the basic 007 formula. Making good on his word to get Bond back to reality, he mostly succeeded in making For Your Eyes Only a stripped back thriller. Gone is the over reliance on hi-tech wizardry, Moore (in his best performance as Bond) is back to being down to earth, being a Bond using his wits and toughness to get out of tricky situations, and the film goes for short sharp shock action scenes instead of giant battles enveloped by even bigger sets. There's much tension as well, none more so than with the finale, where again the big bang pyrotechnics have been replaced by a mountain peak accent and assault; where Bond uses a boot lace to save his skin! Now that's the Bond we love and admire. We even get the return of a bit of flirting between Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) and Bond, while Q (Desmond Llewelyn) is on witty form.Characters are strong, a major plus point in the film.

Melina Havelock (Bouquet convincing) is tough and driven by revenge for her murdered parents, adept with a crossbow she makes a sturdy accomplice for Bond, and thankfully their union isn't bogged down mid mission by the between the sheets angle. Elsewhere, 007 editor John Glenn directs the first of his 5 Bond movies, impressive first outing with the underwater scenes particularly striking. Hume brings Corfu to life via his colour lenses and Conti oversees one of the series' best title theme songs, song with deep emotional beauty by Sheena Easton. His overall score is merely adequate, with decent nationalistic flavours, but the theme song is so strong it lingers to this day in the memory of all Bond fans.It's not all great in this stripped back Bond world, though. The pre-credits sequence makes the terrible mistake of negating Bond's visit to the grave of his late wife, Tracy, by then having him jostle and jape with a bald villain in a wheelchair (is it meant to be Blofeld?) with unconvincing lines and delivery in the mix as well. Lynn-Holly Johnson's Bibi Dahl character is as pointless as it gets, out of place and superfluous to the plot. While some chase sequences, as fun and pulse raising as they are, are over extended and stretch the running time to longer than required. No mind, though, with Bond back to being a man again instead of a button pusher, and brilliant scenes like the keel-hauling peril, For Your Eyes Only was a major hit that raked in over $195 million at the World box office. James Bond's appeal, and that of the man playing him, was very much in vogue. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Roger Moore's finest Bond?","Date":"30 January 2005","Score":"7 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" This was my personal favourite Moore Bond film. He seemed to find the right mixture between drama and humour in this one. Possible exception is the pre-credits helicopter scene where a bald-headed villain with a maniacal giggle takes over control of Bond's transport and nearly sends it crashing into various buildings. This is the best pre-credits in the series for me because its both extremely silly and exciting at the same time. The dialogue is pretty sharp, especially Moore's banter with Topol and there's a very amusing sequence where Q uses a photo-fit device in order to identify one of the main killers. The ski-scenes are exciting if not as good as those in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and the attack on the harbour port and the cliff-top monastery are very well done. Roger Moore's pose as he takes up firing position as a car hurtles towards him is almost iconic. The worst bits are the underwater sequences - although Bond swimming through the sunken Royal Navy vessel with all its corpses is pretty eerie. Overall its a classic Bond film thats up there with Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die as Moore's best 007 outing.

III - The Roger Moore Era - I think. Many Bond-fans I think applies with me, not every other one, of course.. I've read biographies from crew and cast - and other logs from the crossover between the 70's and the 80's - that the hubris and anticlimax that followed a movie called Moonraker caused some hang-over in the production team. There was, at the time, no plans of topping that expensive space-flick. Get back to earth, bring back some of the good old-fashioned spy story.John Glen's debut in the director's seat (had been assistant/2nd unit for several times) was a terrific start to the 80's. The whole movie throughout is impregnated by a sense of re-start, and a think things over-feeling. Discussions of inviting Steven Spielberg to direct had been around, so was a thought of giving Timothy Dalton his debut as 007. Many rumors circulated at the time of giving this movie its blueprints.....OK, Roger Moore already showed some signs of ageing here, 53 years old. (Some age for a supposed to be fit and athletic MI6 agent.....) But, the character was already well worked in, the audience had learned to love the charming gentleman, who jumped in and out of hard trials. (With some hindsight, maybe this movie should have been an honorable farewell for Roger, a good-bye in flying colors, handing over the baton to, let's say Dalton.) But they played it safe for another while...The movie itself has aged well. Feels quite modern some 35 years later. Great stunts as the thrilling opening chopper scene, and the famous Citroën 2CV car chase. To complete the fresh and innovative theme song during the pre-credits, Maurice Binder cuts in performer for the first time, shown in figure. Female artist Sheena Easton completes her lovely voice with an appearance on screen, to the delight of the male audience. An airy, atmospheric tune with just the right touch for kicking off the 80's. The ATAC head story, and the avenge the Havelock's-story, matches each other well. Carole Bouquet's plays a strong, independent and sensitive woman. Not just being James Bond's amusement, as many of them in 007 past. I also think that the audience welcomed a more human villain, rather than a psychotic billionaire who's planning to destroy the world. Julian Glover performs well, and professionally cushioned.In my opinion, it's one of the very best compounded and successfully collected James Bond Movies. 9 out of 10.

This John Glen film is somewhat different from other James Bond films as it portrays how the secret agent is not at all alone in eliminating bad guys as he receives necessary assistance by a beautiful girl. Sir Roger Moore with his pleasing personality makes for a thoroughly intelligent James Bond who does not lose his cool even while facing wily enemies under hostile conditions. He is able supported in his deadly pursuits by a young, suave French actress Carole Bouquet. The use of beautiful locations in Greece, Italy and England help enormously in giving a 'picture post card' feel to this film.

The introduction, seemed to have no bearing on this Bond film, actually it puts to sleep an Old Bond Enemy - The guy that Donald Pleasance used to play.In Actuality, this Bond adventure takes us to a few very beautiful places To the Alps, and especially to Greece and the ocean near Greece, where we meet the most beautiful, in my HO, and most angry Bond Woman ever, Melina Havelock played by Carole Bouquet. And so Bond intersects with Havelock as she assassinates the airplane pilot who killed her parents... And they escape from pursuers in the crappiest car ever shown in a Bond film (And... Where can I get one of those!). This Bond film, brings the Bond series back down to Earth for a bit, it has no High Tech Gadgets, or Space Shuttles, satellites, or rockets of any kind The Macguffin of the film, the ATAC device which was on a spy boat disguised as a Trawler, was an Object that only made sense during the Cold War, and as this film was made in the last 9 years of the cold war, the device ONLY works in the context of the film and the timeline being portrayed.The great Character actor from Fiddler on the Roof TOPOL plays Columbo - A man of misdirection- In one of the best Role Reversals ever seen on Film. In this Bond film, the bad guys and good guys literally flip around mid-through the story.

By far the very best of Moore and what I consider the best of Bond. The film,(and im very thankful for this)steers away from the ridiculous plot-lines that were found elsewhere in the series such as in Moonraker and The Spy Who Loved Me and got down to,what could be considered as, a realistic or believable story with proper espionage situations, action and characters not seen since the likes of From Russia With Love.The action is exhilarating without being over the top. The climb up the cliff-face was on the edge of your seat stuff and the ski-chase was ingeniously executed that has you willing Bond down the mountain throughout. Moore plays Bond magnificently and can actually be seen to be angry enough to push Locques'(a villain who has a great mix of evil with subtleness)car over the cliff-top. A very memorable and credible performance despite clearly aging in the role. Julian Glover puts in a great effort to make his character reasonably interesting(and pulls it off as well as anybody could)and it is a refreshing change to see a villain that is not after world domination or destruction. Meanwhile Topol plays Columbo with near perfection. Neither seems to attempt overplaying their part with memorable one-liners. However Lynn-Holly Johnsons' character, Bibi, may become a tad annoying after a while but does bring a little more humour into the film(not that it needed it)with obvious moves made on Bond and his awkward reaction to them.By far the best thing for me in the film was the introduction of Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock. In my opinion she is easily the best bond girl that can be seen anywhere in the series. She has the beautiful looks, great body, gorgeous eyes and the most seductive voice(like at the end when she says to Bond,as her gown falls, For your eyes only darling-I was just so jealous of Moore at that moment), but can't be seen as another blond bimbo as seen in previous Bonds as she can also act too!. She plays the part of the greek elektra wonderfully,and she can`t half use a bow-and-arrow as well! Many bond girls have been seen in plenty of other work after their appearances but I think it is a great shame we dont see more of Bouquet,shes a great actress and a feast for any mans eyes even now at 44.If Bond 20 has a bond girl that puts in a performance or looks half as good as she does,we're in for one great film!I loved watching this movie and could quite easily watch it time and time again.I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a true bond film that is believable and down to earth.A very much unappreciated Bond that offers plenty and delivers an abundance of everything.Moore-9.9/10, Villain-8/10, Bouquet/Girl-10/10 easily, overall 10/10 if just to watch Melina do her stuff!

Bond is dispatched to recover the device with the help of Havelock.  However when Havelock is killed his daughter Melina is set on revenge and Bond must get the device before she kills those involved.After all that messing around with special effects in space in Moonraker and too much comedy in The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond goes back to basics  for the new decade.  This sees the comedy added to by a nasty streak that sees Bond pushing people off cliffs &#150; even the opening scene is very cruel when you think about it!  It also means the film is a lot tighter and has plenty of good action scenes from start to finish.However the back to basics thing has some downsides.  The whole film is not as memorable as others because it doesn't have any BIG scenes or a BIG ending.  Also the baddie is totally forgetable and doesn't make his mark at all.  However this is still a good spy movie &#150; even if it ranks low as a Bond.Moore is actually good &#150; he seems better now that his humour is toned down to allow him to be cruel.  Bouquet is good but Topol is just an oddity.  Glover is AWOL and the rest of the cast seem more down to earth than usual.Overall it is a really good film but the normal nature of affairs mean it occasionally doesn't feel like a Bond.

The result is a fantastic addition to the series that is a refreshing return to the serious type of Bond film.Roger Moore, for my money, gives his best performance of his entire tenure as Bond in this film. He is a lot more serious and less jokey this time around while still remaining suave and sophisticated. The scene where he kicks a car off a cliff is pretty rad.Melina Havelock is an excellent Bond Girl, played wonderfully by Carole Bouquet. Like Tracy di Vicenzo and Anya Amasova, she is one of the few Bond girls who has a real personality. You can really feel her desire to avenge her parents' murder.The villains, Aristotle Kristatos and Emile Locque, are often criticized as being forgettable, but I like them because they were more realistic. Also in the film is a brief appearance by Blofeld, who finally meets his demise in the pre-credit sequence after Bond drops him down a chimney. It was so cool that Bond finally got his revenge on Blofeld.The action in this film is as thrilling as ever with another unbelievable ski chase and a tense mountain-scaling sequence, but for the first time since On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Bond has a certain vulnerability to him that makes you feel for him.The locations in Greece and Italy were spot-on and the theme song by Sheena Easton is another classic Bond song. Bibi, however, was incredibly annoying and had no place in this otherwise excellent picture.Second to The Spy Who Loved Me as Roger Moore's best Bond film, this return to the style of Fleming's Bond is another one of the series' highlights.9/10 "}{"Title":"Proper Bond","Date":"7 August 2015","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" For Your Eyes Only opens with Bond triumphing over Blofeld.

It's not essential to the plot. And lies somewhere between unbelievable and creepy.Anyway, we soon have some great ski/motorbike chases though it was during one of these that a stuntman was killed. A small gripe is that the score is often annoying.This is a proper film, only reverting to the old jokiness right at the end where we see John Wells and Janet Brown as Dennis and Margaret Thatcher.

Moore was always slightly less physical than Connery in the part, but I don't think anyone looked more like James Bond than Moore. I always thought he did a good job with the role. For Your Eyes Only is a standard Bond adventure that has the British secret agent traversing most of the known world trying to keep a piece of submarine technology out of Russian hands. Julian Glover is perfectly understated as the villain, Kristatos. Kristatos isn't a typical Bond super villain aiming missiles at everyone or trying to steal a space shuttle. It's a little more of a spy vs. spy adventure that has bond taking on the usual assortment of ruthless killers and beautiful women.There are some first class action scenes in this movie including some great underwater photography as Bond the the girl battle the bad guys on a sunken ship for a very 1970s looking computer. The mountain climbing sequences are excellent, as Bond attempts to scale a sheer cliff to get to Julian Glover's hideout. Those scenes have the same feel as Guns of Navaronne. Much of the movie takes place in the mountains of Italy, and they managed to work a ton of winter Olympic type sports into the action. Bond gets chased on a bobsled track and the ski slopes of Veneto, Italy.It's a great adventure movie even if it isn't the greatest James Bond movie ever made. It's not the worst James Bond movie, either. It's got plenty to offer.

Can he find it before the Russians ?Some view the Roger Moore era of James Bond as a bit dated and silly, but personally I think they're amongst the best - I like the gadgets, the over-the-top action, the dolly birds and the bad jokes. They make the films exciting, glamorous, and most of all fun, which is what most movies (and all James Bond movies) should aspire to. This one is a series of fantastic sequences; Bond trapped in a crazy helicopter, a car chase (in a 2CV !) through the Spanish countryside, an action-packed interlude at the beautiful Cortina D'Ampezzo ski resort, an undersea adventure in a mini-sub to recover the MacGuffin, and a vertigo-inducing finale at the Holy Trinity monastery in Metéora. The action flows effortlessly across these locations as the story sweeps along and Moore exudes poise and charm in his signature role. Whilst the support cast are not great, they are all good, particularly Topol as the worldly wise smuggler who turns out to be a key ally. Look also for Harris as the groovy Contessa (she was the wife of future Bond Pierce Brosnan) and Dance in his film debut as a wordless thug. The photography in this movie is superb - it was shot by Alan Hume (Return Of The Jedi, Runaway Train), one of Britain's greatest cameramen, and he does everything from strap the camera to a bobsleigh to stage an interior fight underwater with stunning, razor-sharp looks. The film was recently restored by Lowry Digital Images with excellent results - if possible, please try to see the new print. The stuntwork is also outstanding, and Bill Conti provides a thumping score to accompany it all. Whilst this may not be in the top drawer of Bond flicks (You Only Live Twice, The Spy Who Loved Me, Goldeneye), it's not very far behind. Extremely well directed by Glen, who edited the previous two Bond movies and directed the next four, this is a first-rate action thriller and solid entertainment all round.

Two local agents, the Havelocks, are asked to search for the wreck but they are murdered. Bond tracks down the killer but he is killed by the Havelocks' daughter Melina before he can be questioned. While that lead is lost Bond manages to identify the man who employed the assassin and follows a lead to Cortina where he bumps into Melina again and engages in some winter sports with gun toting bad guys! He also meets his contact Kristatos who warns him that the villain he has to worry about is a Greek smuggler named Columbo... assuming Kristatos can be trusted of course.This film had plenty of exciting moments; highlights include a car chase in a 2CV, the ski chase where bond is pursued by armed men on bikes and the final confrontation in a remote monastery. Unfortunately while it does feature these greatest pieces the story itself is less memorable; he is just trying to retrieve a piece of kit that the bad guy will sell to the Soviets not stop another megalomaniac destroying humanity from his futuristic lair... of course this return to reality might be seen as an improvement by some viewers! Roger Moore continues to perform well delivering plenty of wry asides but also showing a more dangerous side when he killed a cornered assassin. Carole Bouquet does a decent job as Melina as does Topol in the role of Columbo; unfortunately Julian Glover is fairly forgettable as bad guy Kristatos although this is largely down to the character.

Roger Moore does justice to the good script by displaying some fine acting skills, which were last seen in The Spy Who Loved Me.  This film has a dynamic opening sequence, which sees 007 trapped inside inside a remote control helicopter operated by Blofeld.  This is preceded by Bond's visit to his wife's grave.  As much as I enjoyed the helicopter scene, I feel that it was a mistake to bring back Blofeld and the issue of Bond's deceased spouse.  These characters belong to another Bond era and are incongruous in this film.  The musical score is somewhat below par and the talents of John Barry are sorely missed from this film.  There is a abundance of action in this movie, including a breathtaking ski-chase and an intense showdown in a Greek monastery.  Moreover, the use of humour and gadgetry are limited; although the Mrs Thatcher witticism brings light relief at the end of the movie.The most refreshing element of this movie is the fact that the plot is somewhat convoluted.  007 is assigned to track down a piece of military hardware which enables the user to control British submarines.  He soon joins up with Melina Havelock, played ably by Carole Bouquet, whose parents were killed searching for the A.T.A.C.  But the viewer is unaware of the villain's identity until later on in the movie.  Here, the film breaks with convention; usually the villain is introduced at the commencement.There is no major conflict at the end of the film, as there was in Moore's last two films, but this doesn't affect the intensity of the drama.  This is Moore's second best movie after The Spy Who Loved Me.  Admittedly Moore looks older but he isn't too old to play 007.  He was a middle-aged superhero rather than a young sex symbol.  This enabled him to play Bond up to the age of 57.  Contrastingly, Connery looked off the pace at 40 in Diamonds Are Forever.This trenchant espionage thriller is worth a look!

For Your Eyes Only was, until the 007 franchise went into an even steeper nosedive with the risible Octopussy and the creaking A View To A Kill, quite comfortably the worst effort so far. Many reviewers on here have suggested this film was a much-needed return to down-to-earth, gritty realism after the space-set absurdity of Moonraker. But as ridiculous as it was trying to cash-in on the success of Star Wars by sending 007 into orbit, I would argue For Your Eyes Only is every bit as absurd. And I'd go further and say that at least Moonraker was a spectacle and was consistent with its own internal logic. From its catastrophic casting to its laughable plot, FYEO fails at every turn, with Roger Moore turning in, once again, his pensionable-clown-spy shtick. Director John Glen tries to bullseye all the right Bondian staples, with girls, gunfights, villains and set pieces. But like the henchmen Bond battles, he's wide of the mark every time. The girls, for instance; lead foil Carole Bouquet, playing the Elektra-like daughter Melinda, manages to turn in a performance so static she could well have been one of the Greek statues she was so interested in preserving. She may have been a Chanel model, but her performance stinks. At the other end of the emoting spectrum, superfluous character Bibi ramps up the cringe factor by literally throwing her 17-year-old self at the then 54-year-old Moore. Thankfully, Jimmy doesn't indulge. The other female character, the 'scouse Countess', was another character with zero reason to be involved. As with the winter scenes (more later), her inclusion was completely irrelevant. She was a character who posed no threat to the bad guy, so there was no reason for her to be targeted. Apart from, or course, that Bond could then have a Dune Buggy scene. Which leads me to believe dune buggy's were all the rage that summer (see the winter scenes bit below). The girls may have been redundant, but the men involved were also totally forgettable. Apart from a charismatic turn from Topol as Bond sidekick Columbo (who still manages to train his binoculars horizontally whilst following Bond up a vertical cliff-face), the bad guys are personality vacuums. Where previous Bond films had larger-than-life foes, FYEO has the dullest and dumbest yet.Kristatos (Julian Glover) the bad boss-man was possibly one of the more unimposing villains in the 007 canon. His master plan is so non-diabolical is could have been conceived in a monastery. Which is where he ends up. The KGB Biathalon assassin, who is supposedly a high-profile sportsman but yet still tries to kill Bond mid-competition, in broad daylight, tries to finish off Bond by throwing a motorbike in his general direction. Hardly a crotch-crawling laser beam, is it?A mainstay of the 007 films has always been their interest in contemporary trends. Whether that be locations or cultural pursuits, the reason Moore was rocketed into space was because of Star Wars. So when planning the set pieces of FYEO, the public fascination with the Winter Olympics of 1980 in Lake Placid loomed large. Inevitable then that some skiing be involved. Spying and skiing go together like vodka and Martini. It can be extremely exciting (OHMSS, The Spy Who Loved Me). But to then add in an ice hockey assassination attempt?!! Bond body checking one thug into the net with a Zamboni?? Did the guy not see that coming? That scene was laughable. But to then crowbar in a ski-jump scene, a biathlon and bobsleigh. Mr Glen, are you sure we've referenced winter sports enough here? I suppose I should be thankful we didn't see a laser-guided curling-stone bomb, or a machine gun equipped ice sculpture...To continue the ridiculous theme, the car chase at the start included the pursuing thugs drawing alongside Bond's 2CV and receiving a condescending eyebrow arch from our hero (where'd I put my gun, it'd be handy to have a projectile weapon right about now?), the final cliff-climbing scene had one bad guy descend on a rope alone to knock out Bond's pitons with the grip of his pistol (where did I put my gun, it's be handy to have a projectile weapon right about now?) and Kristatos's death-by-coral attempt on Bond has to be one of the most drawn out ideas ever by a villain. If Bond hadn't escaped, he could literally have been at that for HOURS (where did I put my gun... etc). The films have to be fantastical, I know, but they should at least stay consistent to their own internal logic. If Kristatos needed it to look like an accidental drowning, fair enough. But there were literally no witnesses. This was just dumb.Which brings me, finally to the plot. Right at the start, we have a missing ATAC device. The MacGuffin that everyone is after. MI6 know it's off the coast of Albania. They know Malina was on board the ship that was looking for it. So where is Bond sent? To look for the assassin that killed Malina's parents. Why? It's irrelevant who wants the ATAC. Retrieve it or destroy it. Simple. But nope. Bond is sent on a mission to retrieve the ATAC by finding a man hired by a man hired by another man who want to sell the device to the KGB. It just doesn't make sense. Characters make illogical decisions, trying to push the plot forward. I appreciate a good plot as much as the next man, but is HAS to be internally logical, or it just becomes a joke. For Your Eyes Only, for many reasons, is certainly laughable. It beggars belief that Roger Moore went on to do two more (where did I put my gun....?)

A girl who had a mini-sub the whole time. And knew where the wreck was. And was ostensibly working for MI6. And was already diving nearby. But just didn't get around to it. Good thing the Russians weren't looking for it - oh, wait...To be fair, there's some good second unit stuff, better than usual for an Eon production actually, especially the skiing. The underwater stuff, featuring a diving girl who wouldn't go underwater, had to be shot in slow motion sans water, and I must say that the process shots with bubbles fooled me. Good stuff. That stuntman who gets sharkbit in the jewels should have got extra pay. And Topol's a great prop for Moore's sagging charisma. But overall, ehhhhh.

After the box office smash that were THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and MOONRAKER, the producers decided to tone down the huge sets, effects and explosions after some thought the outer space extravaganza of the latter was too un-Bond like. They attempted to bring 007 series back to its roots and they stripped down/away everything to a point where very little of the over-the-top action I usually enjoy in James Bond movies was left in the end, the film plays more like a TV movie or, in my humble opinion, an After School Special than a cinematic adventure. I saw this film countless of times when it was released. I was a teen then and bored out of my mind and went to see it during the summer of 1981 with my high school buddies to kill time. Needless to say, I know this film by heart. And it always made me and still makes me giggle every time I watch it. From the chintzy opening helicopter scene (with the action-packed disco music) to the car chase scene in Spain (more action-packed disco music) to the overdone ski chase scene in Italy (the penultimate use of action-packed disco music here), FYEO always felt like a catalog of James Bond moments seen in countless other 007 epics but this time set to disco music.The music is hilarious. It's probably the funniest Bond score ever. From the opening (and closing) credits when we see Sheena Easton's Deer caught in the headlights face, to the disco song heard during the pool scene, which was so dated back in 1981 and even more so today. The music during the ski chase scene makes me giggle nonstop whenever I hear it. The violins, the guitars, the trumpets. The brilliant John Barry is sorely missed here. The whole set up for the ski chase scene always struck me as being utterly ridiculous Bond is forced to go on a ski ramp, which starts off the whole elaborate chase which culminates at a bobsled track. Spectacular? Yes but it's very contrived. Speaking of contrived, there's the fight scene between Bond and the hockey players. Like so many action scenes in FYEO, it doesn't make any sense. Why not just shoot 007 instead coming up with colorful but corny ways of dispensing of the British secret agent? And they said back then (and still now) FOR YOUR EYES ONLY was supposed to be more down to earth and realistic? Hardly.Then there's Lynn Holly Johnson, who's the most annoying Bond girl ever. At one point, Kristatos slaps her not once but twice. God, that felt so good when he did that. The bimbo deserved it in spades. Because of her presence and her totally useless character, the film felt like the aforementioned After School Special.After the ski chase scene, the film moves to a crawl and almost becomes inert. Like THUNDERBALL, the underwater sequences are slow and dull, filled with endless scenes of stand-ins for Moore and Bouquet. We are then introduced to Topol, who overacts shamelessly. There is one great scene in the second half, when Bond and Melina are dragged through the ocean and coral reef. But as well made as it is, it begs the usual question the other action scenes in FYEO illicit why not just shoot 007 and Melina on the spot?As for the ending it can only be described as underwhelming. Probably the limpest ending in any Bond film! The best thing about FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is Roger Moore. He actually gives a performance worth noting. He's really fun and seems to know that the whole thing is silly and goes along for the ride. It's a shame the rest is so forgettable.

I'm a skeptical fan myself and thus agree with all of the above. No problem, we can fix this&#x85; is what producer Albert R. Broccoli must have thought, and he promptly hired John Glen to be the next episode's new director. Glen already was second unit director and editor for several of the previous 007- movies, so he definitely had the experience, and yet his fresh new style is immediately noticeable. This in combination with a return towards a more old-fashioned story lines and down-to-earth action sequences (literally, when compared to Moonraker) results in For Your Eyes Only being one of the most relaxingly enjoyable and adrenalin-rushing Bond adventures in the entire series. The link with the bombastic old style is symbolically cut through during the fabulous pre-credits opening sequence where Bond's legendary nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (although a faceless version this time) gets wiped off the face of the earth for good. But, contrary to many other Bond movies, the pacing and suspense level doesn't decrease after the title sequences and the plot that unfolds is quite an absorbing one. When a British spying vessel, cleverly disguised as a primitive fishing boat, sinks before the coast of Albania, the hi- tech onboard communication device &#x96; the ATAC &#x96; threatens to fall into the wrong hands. The government already sent out an experienced salver, but he and his wife are brutally murdered in front of his beautiful daughter's eyes by a hired killer. The search for whoever commanded this vile murder brings 007, as well as the ravishing avenging angel Melina, to exotic Greek islands and fancy Italian skiing resorts. The principal villain, a Greek smuggler/double- agent, has evil henchmen everywhere and intends to sell the ATAC- device to the KGB at a tremendously high price. The action highlights are numerous, notably several types of extended chases whether in awesome Citroën 2CV cars, on skis off the tracks and even on the bobsled track. Other memorable stunts include Bond and his love-interest tied behind a yacht and serving as shark bait, a battle with a trio of hockey hoodlums and an anti-vertigo climb towards a monastery hideout lair. The villains in this film are less flamboyant, as mentioned earlier already, but they are utmost menacing and relentless, like for example the stoic psychopath Locque (Michael Gothard) and the beefcake East-German athlete Erich Kriegler. Cult experts will probably even recognize Charles Dance in a (sadly too brief) supportive role as Locque's accomplice. Furthermore For Your Eyes Only benefices from a phenomenal title song, courtesy of Sheena Easton, and some of the most breathtaking Bond girls. Carol Bouquet and Cassandra Harris are unforgettably cool chicks, although the role of the latter is ridiculously small. Lynn-Holly Johnson theoretically also counts as a Bond girl, although luckily the writers realized that the age difference between her and Roger Moore was a bit much&#x85; "},{"Title":"Best Bond performance for Roger Moore","Date":"10 September 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" The particular Bond story is just a little bit more complex and a touch more down to earth.

He has the role down by now and mixes his particular brand of humor (but not camp) with action and romance. These re-watches have really grown my appreciation of Moore in his performance as Bond.French Model Carole Bouquet is perfectly fine as the main female lead, but compared to recent strong females in Bond films (Lois Chiles, Barbara Bach), this was a bit of a letdown. Julian Glover was commanding (as always) as the main villain. I liked his understated choices, especially after seeing megalomaniacal turns in the previous few films. Topol shows up as an ally of Bond's and while he seems to be trying to hard, his screen charisma shines.I have to admit that Lynn Holly-Johnson's teen figure skater, Bibi Dahl, continues to grate on me like nails on a chalkboard and it was a bit creepy when she continually throws herself at Moore.

Although in my opinion, The Spy Who loved Me is Moore's best outing as Bond, For Your Eyes Only is right up there too.I think that John Glen does a terrific job as director in terms of us seeing a more gritter Bond. Moore is great! From the burial grave scene in the movie, we see a serious and thoughtful looking Bond! The scene where Moore(Bond)disposes Blofeld down the chimney is humorous but acted superbly.As the movie continues Moore settles into the role and delivers his lines immaculately. There is that balance between him being serious and injecting just the appropriate sense of humour. One of the memorable scenes in the movie where I thought that Moore timed the humour well, was where he says to Cassandra Harris (Pierce Brosnan's first late wife) 'I'm a writer, I'm writing a novel about Greek Smugglers'. 'Do you know any?' 'I'm sure a woman in your position will get to know many things'.One of the tough moments in the movie was where Moore,(Bond)disposes one of the villains by kicking his car as it is precariously balanced on a cliff and Bond says 'He had no head for heights'.Another thing that I thought was wonderful in the movie was Sheena Easton's theme song that was played in the movie. I thought that it did the movie justice and the chemistry between Moore and Carole Bouquet who plays Melina Havelock was great.Although Moonraker made more money at the box office, For Your Eyes Only is definitely one of Moore's best efforts as the Suave Super spy.

The ATAC is a device that whoever gains control of it can order the submarines to attack any country even Britain. Of course, the Russians want it and the British want it back. The problem is that neither knows exactly where it sunk.The pre credit sequence starts with Bond's old nemesis (presumably Blofled) using a remote control to take over a helicopter that was carrying Bond. Needless to say Bond survives.The movie then continues with the sinking of the British spy ship, Bond's briefing by Bill Tanner the Chief of Staff. Bernard Lee was dead by then so as a mark of respect, his character was made absent from the film, rather than get another actor to step into a role that Lee made as iconic as that of 007 himself. Instead it was explained that he was on holiday.Bond's assignment takes him to Greece where he meets a woman with a deadly crossbow who has her own agenda to pursue, a killer who never utters a word and a Blond Aryan looking hit-man who pursues Bond in one of the most exhilarating ski chases in the Bond franchise.Roger Moore gave one of his best Bond performances in the movie. Here we see a more serious, harder, grittier and colder blooded Moore. In one occasion he has no mercy in a man trapped in a car hanging on a mountain edge. Even the film toned down the glamour of Moonraker and TSWLM and the result was a gritty picture.But Moore fans should not be disappointed if they think Moore was too serious. He still delivered some of his witty one liners which is his hallmark but on the whole he was more serious than his previous performances.Both Carole Bouquet who played the Greek woman on a mission to avenge her parents' death) and Julian Glover (Kristatos, the Greek millionaire and World War II hero decorated by the Queen of England for his acts of valour who tried to assist Bond to disrupt a smuggling ring) gave decent performances. It may be worthy to note here that Julina Glover has been a previous Bond contender.But the stand out was Topol who plays Columbo, the Greek smuggler who in an interesting twist of events reveals why he wants Kristatos dead.The action was fast and furious, even though I'm sure fans may be disappointed at the anticlimax of the final battle scene on a mountain top.

An elaborate villainous lair is not missed, that said, this entry is less extraordinary compared to the rounded and highly enjoyable Spy Who Loved Me (1977).James Bond is once again played by Roger Moore, the opening scene closes a chapter on his wife's death setting a serious tone for Moore's performance and the rest of the movie. There's less gadgets and while the steelier Bond is welcomed with the ending subtle and poignant, Bond girl Carole Bouquet (once the 'face' of Chanel) is less than stirring, mainly due to her lack of dialogue.Bond bad guy Kristatos played by Indiana Jones and Star Wars actor Julian Glover is bland and forgettable, lacking weight especially when compared to other serious Bond outing villains like Kananga and Licence to Kill's Sanchez or more recently Dominic Greene to name a few. Luckily co-star Topol as Columbo is there to inject life on to the screen with Lynn-Holly Johnson albeit a little annoying as Bibi. Both are good fun and Charles Dance show's up as a henchman.There's plenty of on location filming giving For your Eyes Only a more realistic feel and while the lavish sets have been played down here, customary with 007 there's some fantastic practical stunts. The ski chase, motor bike action, cliff scaling and so on.The beach fight and chase is exciting, reminiscent of O.H.M.S.S opening. Cassandra Harris and Moore's performances in their scenes particularly stand out. Even though Bill Conti's score is uneven, at times pure genius and other 80's rubbish tech-no pop, John Glen's directing, Maibaum and Wilson's writing ensure that this entry is more spy action thriller.In retrospect, despite being a relatively less inspiring Bond credit must go to For your Eyes Only for simply bringing the series back to earth and on track.

It is a vast improvement after the overly silly Moonraker and would begin a more serious tone in the 1980's Bond films. The film starts with one of the most memorable Bond intros, where James Bond finally kills his old archenemy Blofeld (though his name is never said). Due to copyright problems the movie makers hadn't been able to use Blofeld as a villain in their films since Diamonds Are Forever and this was their way of saying they don't need him. The rest of the film has nothing to do with the intro. A British spy ship with a highly advanced communication device sinks at the sea of Albania. The Secret Service wants to retrieve the device before the Russians get it and send James Bond after it. While on the case Bond meets Melina Havelock, a Greek woman on a journey to avenge the murder of her parents. This is my favorite Roger Moore Bond film. After the last two films that put much emphasis on gadgets and action, For Your Eyes Only is back to more simpler Bond investigates, which I usually prefer. The plot is good and action is well done, especially the scene where Bond and Melina are used as shark baits is very intense. Also Sheena Easton's theme song is simply beautiful. Roger Moore seems to have woken up after Moonraker and this is the most serious Bond you get from him. Jokes and witty comebacks are at the absolute minimum here and Moore shows Bond's own ruthlessness when he pushed villains' car over the edge of a cliff. Carole Bouquet is great as Melina, adding far more to the plot than majority of Bond girls usually do. It doesn't hurt that she can be gorgeous and kick ass. Unfortunately, the film lacks a proper villain. In Bond films villains are usually greater than life megalomaniacs or not so incredible but usually played by great actors. The villain Kirstatos is play by Julian Glover, who simply lacks the charisma to become a memorable villain these films need. He also played villain in third Indiana Jones movie with as little success. All in all downsides of this movie are few and far between.

Guess I should start with letting people know that while I almost never include spoilers for the courtesy of others, I really feel the need to make an exception with For Your Eyes Only. On a positive note, the spoilers I will give are few and will not ruin the viewer's experience. For those who read my previous Bond review I stated that Never Say Never roughly takes place in between Moonraker and Your Eyes Only. As a number of you know, For Your Eyes Only came out a year before Never Say Never. This is where the first spoiler comes in In Never Say Never, we see the return of Blofeld who headed the Spectre criminal organization thought to have been killed off in Diamonds Are Forever. In Your Eyes Only, Bond finally finishes off Blofeld near the start of the film. Despite Never Say Never being an unofficial 'EON' release and a loose yet much improved remake of Thunderball, For Your Eyes Only should have come out in between Never Say Never and Octopussy as far as I'm concerned. NOW BACK TO THE INITIAL REVIEW For Your Eyes Only delivers most of what 007 fans have come to enjoy regarding a super spy action flick. Still, having come out after Moonraker I can see how some viewers might have found this movie to be a bit of a letdown. The previous Roger Moore bond films had reached a good peak for the series at the time with supposed future technology and special effects. Your Eyes Only somewhat clumped a rehash of previous action/effect sequences used in previous 007 films going as far back to Her Majesty's Secret Service. Normally this is fine and has worked even for some of the later Bonds to come yet in this particular instance, it seems overdone and cliché. Just watch and you will see what I'm talking about. As for the villain of this 007 title, he is very mundane and uninteresting as was the villain Largo from Thunderball (Ironically, the Largo character in Never Say Never was quite improved upon). Mind you, none of the critiques above should discourage anyone from watching this movie. In fact, the bond woman in this is one of my favorites. This is because her character is not the predictable damsel in distress as we have seen in many 007 films. She is independent, a trained fighter, intelligent, and very good looking. As for the music, the theme song to Your Eyes Only is one of the tunes that stand out to me from the bond series. The other tunes I liked were from Goldfinger, Live Let Die, Man with Golden Gun, and Spy Who Loved Me. On a final note, this movie is worth viewing though I will strongly suggest watching it after Never Say Never and also watching it before Octopussy even though nothing connects it to the latter bond title. While some readers will disagree with me on this review and quite possibly Never Say Never, hopefully all readers will have found my reviews informative.

Seeing it at the cinema as a child was an exhilarating experience. So, rewatching this movie again as part of a free to air network's Bond festival here in Australia was an exercise in nostalgia. It's great that the movie has held up all these years later for me. Having seen On her majesty's secret service recently, it's also great that this movie references it. That George Lazenby turn as James Bond is now my pick as the greatest Bond of all time, and now I can appreciate how this movie ties in with that one. Anyway, this is a very watchable and entertaining movie...it even teaches previous Bond movies how to make underwater scenes exciting! (cf. Thunderball). People with a nostalgia for the 1970s will also get a kick out of this movie, I think.Franchise clichésExotic locations - Spain, Italy, Greece.Plot -A covert ship with an A.T.A.C computer system (i.e. Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator) is attacked and the computer goes missing. ATAC launches Britain's submarine nuclear missiles and anyone who can get a hold of ATAC simultaneously neutralises Britain's nuclear deterrent as well as making Britain a target of its own missiles.Pre-title sequence -Maybe the first time I saw this movie I missed the first little part...where Bond is at a cemetery. Even if I hadn't of missed it, I would not have known of its significance. In any case, it's a lovely way to show continuity with Lazenby's turn as Bond...after the Connery outings pretended no one else had ever played Bond. Bond also battles a familiar looking character after that sequence. Due to legal reasons, I think, that character is uncredited. But again, it's a lovely tie in to Lazenby's one shot at playing Bond. There is a great symmetry between this movie and On her majesty's secret service. These two movies are my all time favourite Bond outings. That's a co-incidence - but a nice one - how they book-end each other.Theme song - Sheena Easton has one of the better Bond themes in this movie. For the first time in a Bond movie you can see the singer singing the theme song. Don't think that this has been replicated since...we'll see.Q - Check.M - He's missing in this movie. Moneypenny says that he is on leave. Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny is really showing her age too by now. Of course, you could say the same thing about Roger!Silly female character names - ?! This is the second time in my recent Bond reviews that I've drawn a blank in this category. Sexism/misogyny - Bond is pretty celibate in this movie! One TV guide reviewer for this movie when it screened recently took umbrage at how Bond treated a figure skater. To me it was a sign that the franchise was realising that Moore was ageing and being the playboy was a harder sell than before.Wine snob - Bond takes the nuclear option as far as this goes!End teaser - Check.Things to look out for* the main reason I found this movie so exhilarating as a child had to do with the brilliant car chase sequence on winding European roads. I didn't see anything close to that until Australia's Mad Max 2 topped this film's car chase action. This Bond scene is remarkable for the fact that all this excitement takes place in a very non-standard Bond car! The skiing in this movie is exciting too, it must be said.* This movie is a masterclass in underwater filming. Whereas Thunderball was an overlong underwater travelogue with little tension - despite innumerable heroes and villains in the water - this movie doesn't endlessly drag out these scenes and creates real tension with a tiny fraction of the players of Thunderball. The earlier film is thus like George Lucas' Attack of the clones...lots of sound and fury signifying nothing. For once, less is a whole lot more.* ...so why did Melina leave her air tank underwater? Hmmm.* General Gogol pops up in a Bond movie once more, but only in passing.* You get some historical specificity in this movie...Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is depicted, as is her husband. I found this sequence amusing, but it seems that it really grates for others. Perhaps they are English?* Hmm...there is some poor incidental music in the ski chase scene!* Melina Havelock is a pleasant reminder of Tilly Masterson, from my favourite Connery outing as Bond, Goldfinger.* Hmm...the final scene with Bond and Locque together seems quite dim on my TV. Seemed to find it more well lit and contrast at the cinema. Not sure what that is all about.* Bond with a hat!* Hmm...Moneypenny sounded American to me...thought that a different actress was playing her!

This is the one with the annoying young American figure skater, Topol, and the opening helicopter sequence with Blofeld (his final appearance in the films).FOR YOUR EYES ONLY has just about everything you could want in a Bond movie. We get to see a car chase, some underwater battles, various winter Olympic sports (including battles on a ski jump ramp and hockey rink, and a memorable downhill chase), rock climbing, an out-of-control helicopter, and exotic locations. (Much of the action takes place in Greece.) We even get a scene of Bond playing cards and an appearance from Bond's arch-nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld (head of SPECTRE). As always there's the beautiful female sidekick (Carole Bouquet), the amusing gadgets of Q Lab, and Miss Moneypenny. The great Topol (FIDDLER ON THE ROOF) joins the ranks of James Bond's colorful allies.It seems that FOR YOUR EYES ONLY takes bits and pieces from earlier Bond films and stirs them together to make an exciting new adventure for 1981 audiences. For instance, there's a reference to Mrs. James Bond, from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969). Blofeld, an important villain in earlier films, makes a brief cameo in his first appearance since DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (1971) a decade earlier, and in what would be his final appearance in the series. The scuba-diving scenes call to mind THUNDERBALL (1965). The woman out to avenge her family is an element taken from GOLDFINGER (1964). Bond's card playing comes from such films as DR. NO (1962). Even the skiing has been done before, in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977).The theme song is sung by Sheena Easton, who has the distinction of being the only singer to be shown during the opening titles of a James Bond film. The music in the film has a sort of '80s pop feel. Bond's car, a Lotus, also looks terribly dated nowadays. (It's no Aston Martin.)In this Cold War espionage adventure James Bond travels around Europe to keep a military device out of enemy hands. Roger Moore has his fair share of one-liners, but the director makes a conscious effort to move the story in a more serious direction than some of the previous films. It has a slightly hard-boiled edge (at times). The action is more grounded, in that Bond must rely on his wits and his combat skills to save the day, rather than some wild and wacky gadgets.FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is #12 in the James Bond series, and is the fifth film to star Roger Moore as 007. While far from my favorite Bond movie, this one is still alright. It has its moments. I wasn't really a fan of the opening Blofeld/helicopter sequence and I didn't care for the figure skater character. But the scenery is beautiful (Greece!), Topol is great in a supporting role, Bouquet is lovely as the exotic Bond girl, and the action set-pieces are pretty imaginative (a skier and a motorcyclist on a bobsled track?).Not one of the best or most thought-provoking Bonds, but it's a nice escapist adventure. Like most Bond films, it has its ups and its downs.

As such, the approach to telling the story really stays close to the roots of literature's Bond.Unlike the early Roger Moore Bond films, there is a deeper detective story approach to the narrative of FYEO and the great thing is that mystery lasts long enough to compel the viewer to think deeply. It is also notable that you don't get to know who the villain is until the later part of the film. Oh yes, twists in the plot really make it worth watching too.The cast is solid too and what I like about it is that the characters are much more believable than compared to Moore's earlier 007 adventures. There is no megalomaniac and no unbelievable villains. The villain is a smuggler who once rewarded by Bond's nation. Bond also has a leading lady who is seeking vengeance for her dead parents. As such, professional values, politics and personal vendetta clash and add depth to the narrative. The believable cast and realistic approach to storytelling makes this film really feel like the early Connery Bond flicks. I also like the fact that Moore, who has often been too funny as 007, played the role with lesser humor and more seriousness. I also liked the fact the scene wherein he killed an enemy in cold blood by kicking the car off the cliff. The scene reminded me of Sean Connery in Dr. No.There are some notable differences though. In line with the tradition of Moore Bond films, FYEO has some over-the-top action sequences and chases (skiing on a bobsled track)to heighten the pace. Fortunately, those sequences don't overwhelm the storytelling.Weaknesses? I must declare that Roger Moore's age is the flaw in the film. It does not ruin the story at all, but rather the age makes it so unbelievable to see the very young and pretty Lynn-Holly Johnson express strong sexual attraction to old man Bond. Moore was 53 at the time of shooting and the two notable Bond girls were at least 30 years younger than him. As such, it was a smart move on the part of the producers to insert a 3rd and mature lady (the Countess) having a night with Bond. As what Moore stated in interviews, he knew that staying longer as Bond made the character look like a dirty old man.Is For Your Eyes Only a classic? Absolutely and it's also the best Bond film of Roger Moore's. I give it an 8 out of 10 score.-Sharkey360- http//sharkey360.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"I'll buy you a delicatessen in stainless steel!","Date":"15 May 2009","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" 'For Your Eyes Only' is the forgotten movie of the Roger Moore Bond era. Kevin McClory had threatened to bring Sean Connery out of retirement for a proposed remake of 'Thunderball' which, he promised, would revert to the tougher style of the earlier films of the series. Cubby Broccoli was so worried that not only did he accede to Moore's massive pay demands, but delivered a pre-emptive strike with this movie, the first Bond of the '80's.'Eyes' eschews the sci-fi nonsense and juvenile humour of 'Moonraker' in favour of a more realistic espionage story. A British spy ship - the St.Georges - has been accidentally sunk off the coast of Greece, aboard is a transmitter known as A.T.A.C. Should it fall into the wrong hands, it could conceivably enable the Russians to order our own submarines to attack us. 007 is dispatched to the South of France to find Cuban hit-man Hector Gonzales ( Stefan Kalipha ), killer of British agent Timothy Havelock ( Jack Hedley ) and his wife ( Toby Robins ). Bond is not the only party interested in Gonzales; the Havelocks' fiery daughter Melina ( Carole Bouquet ) is after him too, and has a fondness for crossbows...By 1981, Broccoli had run out of Fleming books, so Michael G.Wilson and Richard Maibaum combined a pair of short stories from the 'For Your Eyes Only' anthology, linked by the A.T.A.C. plot. The Bond movies had steered away from politics in the past, but here the Cold War was featured for the first time. I regret that this happened. It made the '80's Bonds more dated than those of the '60's.Moore was reportedly unhappy with the 'toughening' of his character, particularly Bond's killing of 'Locque' ( the late Michael Gothard ). But it remains one of his finest performances in the role. A major innovation was the concealment of the villain's identity for much of the picture. It looks as though its going to be Greek smuggler Columbo ( Topol ) but no, its Ari Kristatos ( after years of menacing 'John Steed' and 'Simon Templar', Julian Glover had graduated to 007. He gives a splendid performance here ).This was the first Bond to be directed by John Glen, who like Peter Hunt before him, started on the series as an editor/ second-unit director. 'Eyes' has, at times, the look and feel of one of the I.T.C. shows he worked on in the '60's, such as 'Danger Man' and 'Man In A Suitcase'.It is certainly not short on action; the pre-credit sequence in which Bond is trapped in a helicopter over London by Blofeld is wonderfully cheeky, the car chase in France fabulous, ditto the ski scene in which Bond is pursued by a motorbike, and the underwater fight. Rick Sylvester doubled Moore for the breathtaking mountaineering scenes.Among the fine supporting cast, Lynn-Holly Johnson's ice-skating nymphet 'Bibi Dahl' made more of an impression on yours truly than Carole Bouquet's 'Melina'. As Bernard Lee had died, James Villiers was drafted in to play the 'Chief Of Staff' - his only appearance in the role. A young Charles Dance can be spotted as one of the bad-guys.A couple of things I did not like - during the car chase, Bond's pursuers draw level and ( wait for it ) he gives them a friendly wave! What was stopping them from shooting him? The film climaxes with a run-of-the-mill punch-up in a monastery. As climaxes go, it is definitely anti. Worse, the final scene features Janet Brown impersonating Margaret Thatcher. It was funny at the time, but looks horribly embarrassing now.Sheena Easton's title song - though not one of my favourites - was a worldwide hit.Though some were disappointed to not find Richard Kiel's 'Jaws' in the picture, 'Eyes' was a blockbuster. In the U.K., it was the second most popular film on release in 1981 ( the first being 'Superman 2' ), putting it well out in front of Spielberg's 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' ( it came eighth ).Bond had just entered his third cinematic decade in style.

Somehow, although it is pretty good on the whole, has its fine Bond moments and some of the toughest Roger Moore action; it doesn't reach the quality of the Connery years, the early Moore years or of Brosnan or Craig's more recent Bonds.

In my opinion, he started out with two reasonable installments in the franchise, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, and then the franchise improved with The Spy Who Loved Me. Sadly, however, the James Bond movie franchise had a hard fall after that with Moonraker. I would say For Your Eyes Only, the first one made after that highly criticised sci-fi Bond film, turned out to be an improvement, but not as much of an improvement as I hoped for when I watched it recently.A British military spy ship sinks near a Warsaw Pact country after hitting a mine, and the ATAC, a communications system, goes down with it. Whoever gets their hands on this device will have control over all Polaris nuclear missiles! So, a marine archaeologist named Sir Timothy Havelock is asked by the British government to locate the wreck of the ship, but before he can send in his report, he and his Greek wife are killed by a Cuban hit-man named Hector Gonzales, leaving their daughter, Melina, who survives the attack! James Bond is then assigned to recover the ATAC, before it ends up in the wrong hands! On his mission, he meets Melina Havelock, who is seeking to avenge the murder of her parents, and the two team up for the investigation. Obviously, a number of life-threatening challenges await, with enemies sometimes nearby! The opening sequence, before the theme song, shows Bond leaving flowers at his late wife's grave, and going from there to a battle against a familiar foe. This opening sequence is promising, and ends rather humorously. However, from there, the film goes into the theme song, a soft ballad performed by Sheena Easton, which seems out of place in a spy thriller, especially coming right after that opening sequence, which doesn't quite leave the viewer in the mood for a song like that. Through the rest of the 2 hr.+ film, I can't say there aren't any thrilling moments. In fact, there are quite a few of those, such as more than one memorable chase scene. As you would probably expect from a Bond film starring Moore, there's also humour, especially at the end, I would say. Unfortunately, with the thrills and the laughs, there are also some flaws. Bibi Dahl, the teenage ice-skater who appears frequently in the film, I found a tad annoying, not funny (like she's apparently supposed to be), and I know I'm not alone. Also, the scene where Bond and Melina meet underwater with romantic music put to it is just ridiculous! Clearly, For Your Eyes Only is more popular than the widely lambasted Moonraker, and I'm sure many consider it a vast improvement after that film, but not me, I can only consider it a slight improvement, not quite enough to put the franchise back on track. The three flaws I've mentioned aren't quite enough to describe why I'm not too impressed with this 1981 spy thriller, but I'm not exactly sure how to fully explain the rest. Well, as usual, this Bond film is rather long at over two hours, and this is one of the cases where they just couldn't quite keep it consistent enough throughout its long run. I don't know what else to say about this particular installment in the long official James Bond movie franchise, except that if you like spy thrillers, this one might do, but you also just might find that certain flaws really get in the way at times.

'Moonraker' had pushed the gizmo envelope, and the films needed to step back to some old school spy caper... mission accomplished.Moore's cold, dedicated agent harkened back to a Bond not seen since 'OHMSS' or 'From Russia.. before it, and the change was good for all. Moore's sequel of 'Octopussy' (which ran head to head with Connery's 'Never Say Never Again') combined with 'Eyes Only' to deliver a one two punch of Bond films not experienced since the first two films in the series were released, 'Dr. No' and 'From Russia...This film qualifies as Bond Epic.

She left the set when her scenes were finished to shoot Tag der Idioten with Werner Schroeter (see my IMDb review for that, if you like), and it's often been said she did the Bond only for the money so she could continue with art movies.

As befits an assignment such as this, the usual technical gadgets that had become a staple ingredient of Bond at this stage of the movies are missing, and we see a Bond that needs his wits, courage, guile and skill at improvising are all to the fore, and due to this we meet a Bond that we have not known since the days before Goldfinger.This is Roger Moore's finest outing as Bond as the corny jokes are replaced by a cold war plot that racks the tension as high as it can, with a high altitude climax that has my stomach churning every time I see it, which for me is one of the things that makes this film one of the best Bond films. Too often these days films in a series have you feeling little concern for the character, either through poor story telling or poor effects, here like in Empire Strikes Back and Star Trek III I was genuinely thinking How are they going to get out of this?

Much closer in tradition to Fleming's Bond stories. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is Roger Moore's 6th Bond appearance, and he finally has grown into it. After appearing in five other films, one of which is THE SPY WHO LOVED ME which remains one of my favorite Bond films to date, Moore has known the secret ingredient that makes the suave secret agent 007 tick. He has mastered the wit, although not much on the seriousness, but he still manages to be the Bond we hoped for. I practically like Moore's previous Bond attempts, except THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN which is my least favorite Bond film, and I did like FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.In 007's 12th mission, he is sent to retrieve a encryption device called the ATAC which is lost beneath the Ionian Sea. He must retrieve the machine before it falls in the hands of Russians, or a profit-hungry dealer who wants to gain profit by selling it to the Russians. Bond is once again aided by a beautiful femme, this time is the vengeful Melina (Carole Bouquet), who vows to avenge the death of her parents. Chases and exciting action scenes abound.The film has its share of flaws. The score by Oscar-winner Bill Conti is not quite as good as its predecessor, composed by John Barry. The title song is great however. The film lags in some parts. But the overall film is still a compellingly watchable spy thriller. The plot and its delivery is much closer to the Ian Fleming spirit, and Moore is getting to be a great Bond. He's often very funny when delivering some witty lines, and often very good in action scenes. He's a bit jokey, but he works. John Glen, regularly known as the worst Bond director, has done quite a good job in his 007 movies, and he has done a fine job here.

Bond can ski, climb mountains, and go deep sea diving without worrying about a madman who wants to rule the world.The only drawbacks were two of the Bond women. Carole Bouquet is rather boring and plastic throughout the movie. The really annoyance, though, was Lynn Holley-Johnson who plays a young ice skater.

Although at first it may not seem to fit in well with the Bond series, the music does actually go very well with the action happening, with a wonderful disco-type version of the 007 theme.I also feel that this is one of the more violent films of Moores tenure. The intensity and emotion is amazingly felt as Locque smashes into Countess Lisl or killing of Locque by Bond in cold blood.This is one Bond film which is underestimated and should be viewed by not just Bond fans, but also to any action fan.Bond will return in Octopussy "},{"Title":"A Return To Basics Of Sorts","Date":"10 January 2007","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" This is one of the better Roger Moore Bond films owing to the fact that a return to basics was in order after the overblown Moonraker, that verged on comedy. Thankfully, what little comedy there is has been greatly toned down. There is a lot to like here but the pre-title sequence is simply ludicrous and even appears tacked on. Throwing a Bloefeld like character down a smoke stack while throwing out quips about buying Bond a delicatessen. Huh? This movie does more than take a nod from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. From the opening scene showing Tracy's grave (finally, a mention that Bond was married), to a ski chase scene (Moore wearing blue as did Lazenby), there's also an ice skating and sleigh ride scene, only to top it off with a mountain hideaway for the bad guys. The villain is rather weak, for the life of me, I can't remember his name. The electro-pop score seems to jar you away from the movie at times but overall it does work paving the way for other electronic score such as Goldeneye. Not a bad Bond outing and this film should have been Moore's swan song for they almost got it right.

The supporting cast is great, especially Topol and Glover, and Bill Conti's score is a humdinger.

Bond truly is back!","Date":"18 December 1999","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  After two really bad movies which are below cartoon quality, followed by another which had potential but blew it, followed by the extremely successful yet completely horrid in every other sense story (that's, in order, Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, and Moonraker we are finally presented, once again, with a true Bond film.  Bond has only been 'serious' and 'down to earth' three times before Dr. No (1962), From Russia With Love (1963), and On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1968).  It was Goldfinger which introduced the campy, cartoonish style which as a principle is as far away from Ian Fleming's creation as you could get.  Unfortunately, people liked it and that's why 11 more Bond movies made throughout the years are no more than cannon fodder with the occasional glimer of hope promptly snuffed out by the desire for cheap antics...Even better, with the first two Bond movies aside, look at all 19 Bond (as of 1999) titles and combine them ONLY with sales returns.  Ignore every other aspect - writing, acting, etc.  See the movies whose attendences were lower?  Those are actually the *better* ones in terms of plot, content, style, and depth (A View to a Kill excepted!)  -)Back to F Y E O.  A NATO sub is shot down off the coast of Greece which contains the ATAC, a device critical to NATO.  Bond is sent out by MI6 by M's superiors (Bernard Lee died in this time, so M was not included in the movie - fortunately the movie has such a serious intent that M's superiors were needed anyway) to retrieve the device... and, you guessed it, he's in for a great deal of trouble and intrigue.  This movie has depth (in both plot and character) so if you're into pointless hollywood action and sexual drivel then this movie is not for you.Not only is this movie serious, it also has a few plot twists which continue to distract yet enthrall the viewer to come back for more (or Moore!).First of all, and I'm going to say this before or again, Roger Moore EXCELS himself in this movie.  Now, Moore himself protested at the movie in terms of darker style and having Bond himself killing someone in cold blood (Bond's shot people before but that's on duty.  In this movie Bond is emotionally driven to kill - yes, it's an oddity but refreshing from the standard sort of rubbish viewers expect and more along the lines I'd expect from any good film - character depth!  Bond, in this movie, gets more depth added to his character than Bond's previous 5 outings combined - 4 Moore plus Diamonds are not Forever which is truly terrible)  But Moore's acting throughout shows he is mature enough to play the role as instructed and he should be given an award for his performance (seriously!).  He even does most of the underwater scenes (which are truly impressive... oh, this movie rocks in so many ways.)Also, we are reminded in the pre-credits teaser of Blofeld, the man who was responsible for the murder of Bond's wife, Teresa.  Though his name is not mentioned (someone else owns the right to the character name) any true Bond fan will recognise this guy immediately.  This action sequence is quite impressive, although Bond's levity aimed at Blofeld is incongruous with some of Bond's lines and mannerisms in the remainder of the movie.For example, this is the first time since On Her Majesty's where Bond falls in love, rather than the usual bang blam boom, thanks babe fling. (Moore excels himself here and it's a pity his era wasn't mostly 'down to earth'.) Did I say that Moore is truly a highlight in this film?  Bond himself is getting some depth and goodness for once but Moore simply handles the character with great ease and charm.  He may look a little old but his acting is so incredibly good that it's too easy to forget his age - not all actors can do this and get away with it!And, if things still don't get better we have Julian Glover as the main villain.  Anything he's in seems to improve the overall quality of the work and in this movie it's no exception...  he also does some things you wouldn't normally see in other Bond films.  This movie is truly refreshing in many ways (yes, it's violence but get real please - it's still fiction, but we're trying realism for once).The Bond girl, well one of them, is literally a girl and throws in a surprise or two of her own... the other has a real name, too Molina Havalock - again, another refreshing name after such degrading, farcical, and disgusting names like Pussy Galore, Plenty O'Toole, Holly Goodhead.  This movie just has it all.There's a LOT of action in this movie which would normally borderline gratuitous (not in violence but the fact there's a lot of it.)  But these scenes mostly come across as realistic and have a logical point (unlike scenes which show stunts just for the sake of Look ma, no talent on the acting or writing so we'll do this instead to wow the audiences such as in one of the farces which has Bond riding a motorbike to catch a plane gone off a cliff, to get into it and do a 180 degree flip and flu off like a little birdy to safety... ugh).Best of all is the music.  Bill Conti did a smashing job of the music. Yes, it has some disco influences but believe it or not that actually HELPS the music rather than hindering it and Bond flicks (The Spy Who Loved Me for example) suffered because of disco.  The re-release of the soundtrack will be available in February I gather and it's worth every penny - even more so since this new release has added tracks!Oh yeah, the ending of the movie is just plain rivetting and shocking (but not in ways you expect.)But not quite  The actual ending is a reminder to fans that, yes, this is Roger Moore as James Bond so something incredibly silly and bad has to be included.  (for most of the movie, Bond's quips are actually worthwhile and are truly funny since they are not contrived.)Okay, you're right... that's just before the end.  In the actual end, James put the phone next to a macaw parrot because he wanted to get the goodies with Melina.  Well, this is when the Prime Minister (Margret Thatcher, played by an impersonator no less) and her hubby personally congratulate Bond.  This alone is almost insulting (trust me, it hurts to view) but when the macaw starts spitting out lines it hears from Bond and Melina... still, I'm not letting 3 minutes ruin the entire movie - not when the 3 worst minutes are at the extreme ending.  But this does compel me to give the movie a 9 instead of 10.Also, you'll notice how The Living Daylights (once Koskov is sent through the pipes system - as the opening until that point is a short story and not original handwork) has a few plot parallels to this (smuggling, duplicity, framing...)  TLD is smashing, too, for its own merits - don't get me wrong - I thought it'd be fun to point this out.  At least Dalton's era had borrowed from a good movie whereas Brosnan's passe writing team nicked stuff from fairly average or low-part (in plot/writing) movies because those movies had greater attendances.

He discovers that the mastermind is a Greek smuggler of heroine and weapons, Ari Kristatos(Julian Glover), a successful businessman, revered by the British and other countries, successfully able to hide his underhanded, corrupt extra curricular activities. Bond also partners up with Ari's nemesis, Columbo(Topol), another smuggler(..of more harmless goods such as cigarettes and pistachios!),whose lucrative criminal business he seeks to move in on, and Malina(the positively gorgeous Carole Bouquet), a vengeance seeking Greek beauty wanting to kill those responsible for her parents' death, an ace with a crossbow. Ari paid a hit-man to assassinate Melina's parents for they knew too much about where the sunken British ship(containing the device sought after)was..and were working with Bond's country to find the ship.A departure from the Roger Moore Bond films that came before it, featuring less gadgets and more stunt-oriented action set-pieces allowing 007 to out-ski, evade, out-drive, and out-shoot his adversaries, often receiving help from his allies, like Melina and Columbo with his men. There's a thrilling action set-piece where Bond must evade an expert Olympian East German skier with a marksman rifle shot, and two motorcycle assassins down an Italian slope, encountering innocent civilians and other athletes competing in various competitions. The chase in a Madrid village and countryside with Bond using Melina's embarrassingly small Citroën trying to outsmart two superior vehicles as the enemy follows behind constantly shooting, is also ridiculous, but entertaining. But, Bond's ascension up a mountain to infiltrate Ari's men stationed in a monastery to hand over the retrieved device to the in-coming Russians(..approaching in their helicopter)is a nail-biting and breathtaking affair where he must contend with a mercenary attempting to send him spiraling to his death. Moore does have some classic one-liners which accompany the action or contending with Ari's horny expert skater, Bibi(Lynn-Holly Johnson)who wishes to bed him. Julian Glover is a formidable foe as Ari, because he successfully shows how he could manipulate people into thinking he's a nice guy, quite a chilling villain who could give you a warm handshake while unflinchingly stabbing you in the back. Michael Gothard is a classic James Bond henchman archetype, Locque, who works as Ari's street leader, pointing out the troops on who to execute. Features a really neat two person submarine used by Bone and Melina to go underwater to find the British ship and important device, and the disposal of the oft-used gadget car proved that director John Glen was focused on returning the franchise to it's roots. There are homages to the classic Bond films of old, touching on his wife, visiting her grave, his disposing of Blofeld(John Hollis, a Telly Savalas look-a-like, treated as a caricature)in a helicopter that was wired from a remote control device with the plan going awry, and the toss of the top hat as it instantly finds it's place on the rack of M's office. While Bond finds some time to bed a few ladies, he seems far less sidetracked and more determined to complete the mission/agenda. This is clearly a film directed in tone retracing the Bond character back to the golden years of Sean Connery, while still maintaining it's tongue-in-cheek humor, there's more emphasis on the action, less on goofy comedy bits and preponderance for silly special effects. Topol is a welcome presence as a likable criminal, who lends great support to Bond when he so desperately needs it, and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY rescued Moore from his character becoming an absolute clown. While I welcome gadgets, I was pleased with the decision to take this particular Bond film in an opposite direction, where the effects are not heavily relied upon to increase wonder and excitement. And, the villains in this film are less cartoonish and more realistic, with our Bond babe able to participate a bit more in assisting our hero.

Especially since this one began with him visiting the grave of his wife Tracy though that partially threw me off since George Lazenby was Bond when he met his future wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. That then leads to him offing Blofeld in a pretty ridiculously entertaining pre-credit sequence that makes the rest of the movie seem more serious in comparison. The fact that it takes awhile to find out if Julian Glover or Topol plays the villain is intriguing and many of the action sequences are top-notch and mostly logical considering the partly-confusing premise. Carole Bouquet was fine as the romantic lead here and Lynn-Holly Johnson wasn't so annoying as the young American wanting to bed Bond but the most intriguing pairing was that of Cassandra Harris, the late wife of future Bond Pierce Brosnan, and Moore in their all-too brief scenes as they looked the most age-appropriate in their rendezvous with Moore looking the most wistful when he said goodbye to her in their last scene together. The score by LSU alumna Bill Conti seemed of its time from the early '80s but it was still entertaining to me and his title song as sung by Sheena Easton is still a favorite of mine. And the last scene with the Margaret Thatcher-lookalike was still quite funny to me. All this and Q having a more expanded role than usual (due to original M, Bernard Lee, being in his final days) makes For Your Eyes Only one of the most enjoyable low-key James Bond adventures ever!

As the daughter of assassinated Greek tycoons, she pursues the villains on her own and manages her own subplot until combining efforts with Bond.

The action sequences are tense and credible. The character are more realistic and far less outlandish - with Topol making a nice addition as a good-natured colleague.

This opening is both exciting and poignant, with Tracy's grave and the Blofeld reference both being used to great effect. Bond trying to regain the helicopter contains some excellent stunt work and it is just an entertaining opening.Theme Song Sheena Easton's title track is truly fantastic and one of the series best. It has such a beautiful melody which is romantic without feeling out of place and when it reaches the chorus it really soars. Easton delivers the vocals perfectly and even the seductive lyrics are catchy. Plot Bond is sent to locate a missing device called an ATAC that sank with a British ship, with the Russians also after it. Along the way he suspects that two notorious smugglers are involved and attempts to help Melina Havelock who believes one of the smugglers killed them. This is a fantastic story and feels like something for the early Connery days. The plot is played out much more seriously than in the previous Moore films and there a sense of realism throughout that is very welcome. I also think that the story flows smoothly with very few scenes feeling out of place or unnecessary, everything feels like it has a purpose compared to the excess we saw in the likes of Moonraker. James Bond Moore gives his most serious and probably best portrayal here. Of course he still gets plenty of one liners and is enjoyably suave, but he acts more ruthless and even a bit weary which are interesting additions. Some might think he looks a bit old at this point , but he still pulls it off here.Bond Girls Carole Bouquet does a solid job as Melina. It's nice to have a tougher leading lady and she handles the more emotional scenes very well. However she isn't given a great deal to do and she doesn't really have great chemistry with Moore. Lynn-Holly Johnson is dreadful as ice skater Bibi. The character is just incredibly annoying and Johnson's wooden delivery doesn't help matters. Villains Julian Glover is perfectly fine as Kristatos given the serious tone, but he just isn't memorable. The issue is that he just isn't given anything that interesting to say or do. But he plays the role with a ruthless nature that fits and he certainly looks the part as his scenes with Moore are always engaging. Michael Gothard does a great job as the assassin Locque. Despite not having a line, his intense expressions and quiet presence definitely leave an impact.Support Chaim Topol is great deal of fun as Bond's charismatic ally Columbo. He just has a really likable presence and his introduction makes the film even more engaging. Cassandra Harris, wife of Pierce Brosnan, shows up in a small but memorable role as an apparent countess. Desmond Llewelyn is excellent once again as Q with much more involvement this time round.Action The action here is more realistic than the other Moore entries. There is an enjoyable car chase in a Citroën in the Greek countryside that is light-hearted without feeling silly. There are a number of shootouts that are filmed well. The scene where Bond and Melina are dragged through the reef is simply a brilliant idea and executed just as well. The climax is truly spectacular, with Bond having to scale Kristatos' mountaintop monastery and the resulting fight for the ATAC being packed with tension and shot brilliantly.Score Bill Conti composes a suitably energetic score. It has a funk influence that makes it different and a lot of the compositions are filled with the drive that is needed for such a film, while there are also some really pleasant soft tracks that give the score a good sense of balance. Production Values This is the first of John Glen's five films and he shows himself to be a very capable director. He doesn't really do any overly impressive shots, but his grounded style is effective and a welcome call back to Terence Young. The film is paced almost perfectly, it knows exactly when to speed things up or slow them down and at no points does it become boring despite some dialogue heavy parts. I also think this is the best writing of the Moore period. There isn't anything iconic being said, but it all feels very believable and the conversations the characters have here are always engaging. Moore's slightly more ruthless Bond is great, the scene of him kicking Locque's car off a cliff is brilliant and he handles it perfectly. The locations are all great and they look beautiful on screen, with the use of Greek islands giving the film another unique twist.Conclusion For Your Eyes Only is an enjoyable return to the more grounded early Bond films. The gadgets and absurd plot lines are dropped in favour of a realistic approach and more believable characters. It doesn't always work, but it must be commended for taking the series back to its roots. Roger Moore showed that he could be serious and the action is exciting without being outlandish. Some of the characters aren't fully realised, but I can forgive that because of what it tries. John Glen made a great start to his run as Bond director and Moore would have ended on a high if he'd have stepped down after this.

But in this case a British spy ship trawler has been sunk and with it an encryption device that if the Russians get a hold of it will play havoc with the guidance systems of the Polaris missile defense system. Can't let the Soviets have it at any cost.But where is it and how to retrieve it is what Moore is up against. His investigations take him to a pair of feuding Greek crime lords in Julian Glover and Topol. He's also got the usual group of women anxious to be Bondified. Carole Bouquet from the French cinema plays the daughter of a scientist whose parents are killed when they go searching for the device. Lynn-Holly Johnson is a young figure-skater, an Olympic hopeful who has a mysterious indirect connection with what's going on and she's crushing out on 007 big time. And Cassandra Harris as the mistress of one of the crime lords sent to seduce Bond. Her's is an ironic role since she would wind up being married to future James Bond, Pierce Brosnan.Of course the Adriatic and the Aegean are areas it is impossible not to have gorgeous color cinematography. The reliance on devices is almost non-existent here as Bond is forced to rely far more on his wits than in stuff that MI6 is giving him. And the film earned an Academy Award nomination for the title song, sung beautifully by Sheena Easton.Roger Moore has always been my favorite Bond and For Your Eyes Only shows him at the top of his game.

The worst has to be watching Roger Moore trying to look serious and lethal super-spy, in scenes that would be more at home in a spy b-movie. Even the occasional goofy humour is of dubious quality.

In this film he merely has to contend with a sub-standard script and a sub-standard score from Bill Conti. Filled with the usual array of howlingly bad puns, For Your Eyes Only is one of the worst films in the series, its admittedly well staged action sequences--of which there are many--continually undercut by Conti's atrocious post-disco cues, which manages to even sap the life from Monty Norman's magnificent title theme.

However, Moore's films are the one's I remember most vividly from childhood as they had the best gadgets and bad guys like Jaws and Baron Samedi. So it is strange then that this film should be one of my favourites, as it is low on gadgets and memorable bad guys.After the space capering of Moonraker, this was advertised as Bond's return to earth, and deals with more serious subjects and is darker than usual. It takes us back to the early days and themes of Bond. Bond visits the grave of his dead wife during the start of the movie, setting the tone, but also showing us that the Secret Agent will always be haunted by the past, and will never be at peace. Aside from the main plot of Bond trying to race the Soviets to the possession of a powerful device capable of messing with submarines (i think), we have a joint revenge tale. Melina, played brilliantly by Carole Bouquet, is in search of those who killed her parents, the same people after 'the device', while Bond is on a quest for the psychotic 'Dove' assassin who kills a fellow agent, and one of Bond's women-Lisle, played by Pierce Brosnan's wife at the time, Cassandra Harris. Harris would tragically die before Brosnan picked up the Walther. The scene in which Bond kills the Dove is dually one of the most ruthless and satisfying deaths in any Bond film, and Moore plays the scene with great skill.Another reason for my enjoyment of the film, and ironically this is a central reason for why many dislike it, is the inclusion of Bibi Dahl. The character may be pointless, but Johnson plays it perfectly, making both Bond and the audience cringe. Plus she is one of the most attractive Bond girls...Topol is charismatic, the one-liners do not get in the way of the film or make us turn away in shame like those in Die another Day (Worst Bond Ever), and the stunts and car chases are simple but outstanding, refusing to resort to an over-abundance of gadgets. 9 out of 10.

Wilson, and is the twelfth film in the franchise. In this film, James Bond must investigate the sudden sinking of a British spy ship in Greece and recover a machine that, if it falls into the wrong hands, can compromise the British submarine defense system. To fulfill the mission and prevent the Soviets from obtaining the lost system, the spy will take the help of a girl who seeks to avenge the death of her parents.This is another movie where Bond will protect his country in the context of the Cold War. As seen in The Spy Who Loved Me, the threat of open war between Russians and Americans was already a situation that both powers sought to avoid, in so-called policy of détente. In fact, Bond mentions that policy in this film, in one of the final scenes, addressing the Russian General Gogol. This is probably one of the most memorable scenes in this film. In another, Bond scale an almost vertical mountain, in order to get to villain's lair. And how can we forget the famous chase scene where Bond, at the wheel of a disjointed Citroen 2CV, makes cross-country by the Andalusian hills? In addition to that famous scenes, we must appreciate the good performance of the cast, particularly Roger Moore, which achieved to harmonized well his comic vein with the pure action scenes, showing much more the aggressiveness that he seemed to tempered in previous films. The opening theme, For Your Eyes Only, sung by Sheena Easton, is also unforgettable.Besides the central cast, inherited from the previous films, and the continuation of Roger Moore in the role of 007, in this film participated Carole Bouquet, in the role of the Bond-girl Melina; Topol gave life to Columbus; Julian Glover represented the villain, Kristatos; Cassandra Harris took the role of Countess Lisl and Lynn- Holly Johnson gave life to the nymphet Bibi Dahl.

Even though it is my second-favourite Bond movie there are still a few seriously terrible bits, notably the pre-title sequence and the final scenes, with a ridiculous Mrs Thatcher impersonation and a parrot, a rather disco-y soundtrack and a quite forgettable theme tune sung by Sheena Easton (who is the only singer to date to actually appear on screen during the title credits.....why though is still a mystery). Over-look those however, and the rest of the film is terrific. Bond is essentially back to basics, and uses his wits and skill throughout the film rather than relying on Q's gadgets. Following the murder of marine archaeologist Timothy Havelock, who was hired by MI6 to locate the ATAC machine from a sunken British spy ship, Bond is assigned to discover who killed him and to retrieve the ATAC before it falls into the hands of the Russians. There's a couple of stand-out chase scenes, following Bond's gadget laden Lotus being destroyed, he's left to take the wheel of a Citroen 2CV for the car chase, and the later ski chase is pretty fast-paced too. While we still get the occasional trademark Moore quips these are dramatically toned down and there is a much more serious and edgier performance, this is especially highlighted in a brilliant scene which sees the villain's henchman in his car hanging precariously on the edge of a cliff, and Bond vengefully and cold-bloodedly kick the car over the edge (this was followed by a quip, but it marked a brutal change in Moore's portrayal of Bond for this film). Stunning French actress Carole Bouquet plays Melina Havelock, a strong willed woman who is out for revenge following the death of her parents. Learning that her parents are connected in the mission Bond is assigned to, she teams up with Bond to avenge her parents death and help him locate the ATAC device. As for the villain, well the film does not establish a clear villain until some way into it's running time. Initially we are led to believe that Milos Columbo (played by Topol), the pistachio chomping former partner of Aristotle Kristatos is the man behind the death of the Havelocks however it turns out to be misinformation as Kristatos is in fact the man behind the killings and has been working with the KGB to obtain the ATAC system. Kristatos is portrayed brilliantly, and much more low-key than previous 'world-dominating' wannabe villains of previous films, by Julian Glover. With great locations including Corfu and Cortina D'Ampezzo in Italy, For Your Eyes Only is a satisfying and thrilling entry in the series.

However, while on the case he gets captured by the assassin and only manages to escape when a beautiful woman named Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet) kills the assassin which creates the diversion he desperately requires. As it turns out, Melina is the daughter of the man who was killed by Hector and now she wants the man who ordered the assassination even more than James Bond. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it was a decent James Bond film but not as good as some of the others in the series. From what I understand, the previous James Bond film (Moonraker) was criticized for being a bit too fanciful and as a result the director (John Glen) tried to bring the series back to a more basic style. Unfortunately, I think he may have over-compensated somewhat as this movie lacked the excitement normally associated with its predecessors. In any case, it had its good points and having two lovely actresses like Lynn-Holly Johnson (as Bibi Dahl) and the afore-mentioned Carole Bouquet certainly didn't hurt. Again, I don't think it's quite as good as some of the other James Bond films but it will suffice. Slightly above average.

It was a decade of ups and downs both on screen and behind the scenes. The series had gone back and forth between extremes has it changed leading man, lost one of its producers, fought off indifference from both critics and the public alike to stay alive. Though it left the decade in great financial shape thanks to Moonraker, that same film had sent it so deep into science fiction territory that it looked as though it might never come back from it. The first Bond film of the 1980s, For Your Eyes Only, would bring the series back to earth and Bond would hit the ground running.Nothing in the film is more surprising than Roger Moore's Bond. Doing his fifth Bond film, Moore would seem to have settled into the role by becoming a Walther PPK toting comedian but here he changes that perception. Moore definitely has his quips and almost all of them are good this Moore at his most serious as Bond. One need only look at Moore in scenes such as his serious scenes with Carole Bouquet or the scene where he dispatches Locque to see that despite his reputation, Moore could in fact act. There are only a few moments where Moore seems ill at ease but that is the fault of the particular actress in those scenes (who will be discussed later). Overall, it's Moore giving his single best performance as Bond.Making for another change is Carole Bouquet as Melina Havelock. Melina hearkens back to the three dimensional Bond girls of the past such as Domino and Anya Amasova, especially in the way the character is written. Carole Bouquet brings the character to life skillfully and realistically, bringing the revenge minded character to life. Bouquet also shares some excellent chemistry with Moore as well, helping to make the relationship between them all the more believable. Though seemingly forgotten behind more famous (and suggestively named) Bond girls, Bouquet as Melina is both a highlight of the film and the series.The supporting cast of the film is for the most part successful as well. Julian Glover and Topol play the film's two other major characters, Kristatos and Columbo, who both make a major plot twist in the film believable by playing two different versions of their respective characters. Michael Gothard makes quite an impression as the silent henchman Emile Locque, always lurking and always being menacing. The film also sees actor James Villiers take on the role of MI6 chief of staff Bill Tanner, replacing M as played by the recently deceased Bernard Lee, and in a way it is a shame that Villiers didn't become the new M as he seems to be set up for exactly that here. The only major misfire of the supporting cast is as Lynn-Holly Johnson the ice-skating Bibi Dahl who, through both writing and Johnson's performance, is nothing but the only cringe inducing piece of an otherwise serious Bond film. Despite Johnson, the supporting cast of For Your Eyes Only is for the most part excellent.Much of the credit for the film's success lies in the decision to bring Bond back to earth. From the opening pre-credits sequence which tips its hat to both Bond's dead wife Tracy and the series former arch-villain Blofeld, the film almost seems to harken back to the Bond films of the 1960s rather than the films that immediately preceded it. There are strong echoes of On Her Majesty's Secret Service from the aforementioned pre-credit sequence (which is almost a mini-sequel to that film), the snowbound sequences and the final assault on the mountain hideout of the villain. The film also echoes both From Russia With Love and Thunderball as well, mirroring major sequences from both films. The results are both familiar and yet excitingly fresh at the same time.For Your Eyes Only might come across as being more serious than the average Bond film, but it is no less action packed. The action covers air, land and sea and the results are superb all around. They range from Bond attempting to take control of a remote controlled helicopter in mid-flight to a surprisingly effective car chase, excellently filmed ski sequences, suspenseful underwater sequences and a climbing scene that features one of the most impressive Bond stunts ever. Like the references to the past, these action pieces cover familiar territory but do so in a way you might never know the difference.Nowhere though does the film come down to earth more than in its script. After the out of this world and often cringe worthy hijinks of Moonraker, Bond returns to familiar territory in more ways than one. Bond finds himself in a Cold War thriller, with a vital piece of Western defense up for grabs while also dealing with the revenge minded but beautiful woman whose family was killed in pursuit of it. In bringing that plot to life, the film's writer's returned to Ian Fleming's original short stories and novels, combing pieces from across the literary cannon. As a consequence, this is a storyline and script that is somewhat closer to reality than Bond had been in more than a decade with the result being a film that is much more suspenseful and even exciting than it's over the top predecessor.Where though does For Your Eyes Only rank amongst the Bond films overall? In terms of the Roger Moore era, it is certainly the best thanks to both Moore's best performance as Bond and its down to earth plotting. In the series overall, it is a film that is highly underrated. Because, with its acknowledgments and echoes of the past, it is almost as if the film seeks to remove a decade's worth of questionable Bond films and start afresh. In that regard and others, For Your Eyes Only succeeds.

By this point in the Bond film series, one can see an odd pattern, in that the Moore Bonders either follow or parallel the Connery Bonders, in order Live and Let Die, Moore's first, parallels Connery's first, Dr.No, returning to the Caribbean locations and including a character named Quarrel. The Man With the Golden Gun is similar to From Russia With Love, in that the plot is small scale, with hardly any gadgetry. The Spy Who Loved Me is Moore's best, as grand as Connery's Goldfinger, with a similar megalomaniac villain. Moonraker followed the outer space theme of You Only Live Twice, with a huge budget. And now we have For Your Eyes Only, which follows up On Her Majesty's Secret Service with the same ski chases & stunts, and the teaser begins with Bond visiting his wife's grave-site - the wife who was killed in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The teaser, where-in Bond has his final encounter with Blofeld (also from the earlier film, but he's not named & his face is not shown here), ends on a very tongue-in-cheek note, but most of the film after the credits is fairly serious in approach, with just a few small silly unobtrusive jokes here and there. Sheena Easton sings the title song; it's fairly well done, smooth, but unspectacular. This is probably Moore's 2nd-best Bonder after The Spy Who Loved Me, but one must keep in mind that most of Moore's Bond films were sub-par.This was John Glen's first directing job after editing several of the previous Bonders; he'd return for the rest of Moore's run and both Dalton efforts. He brings a steady, assured hand to the proceedings, a 'back-to-basics' approach after the excesses of Moonraker. And, it's probably a bit too basic - quite professional, but there do not seem to be any scenes which really stand out, as in a few of the better Bonders. M is 'on leave' here (actor Bernard Lee passed away around this time), and Bond is raked over the coals by a couple other high ranking Brits; Bond is barely tolerated in this one. Q has some extended scenes; there's a now-crude display of computer technology involving an 'identigraph' which must have looked cool back then. Bond travels to Greece to seek out a sunken ship and runs across a femme fatale (Bouquet) whose parents were killed by an assassin employed by the main villain. The locale is nice and Glen stresses a lot of chasing on narrow roads and on the ski slopes (in Italy now). The villains, like everything else, are not very memorable, including a Nordic super-henchman, but the plot and suspense engage the viewer while the story proceeds at a fairly good pace and you won't get too bored. Moore was now in his early fifties and while his scenes with the mid-twenties thirtyish Bouquet may still work with the more open-minded, the subplot of the teen actress Johnson wooing him will probably make most viewers cringe a bit - if they're not grinning and shaking their heads. Moore was at his best when with the more mature Countess character and pushing bad guys off cliffs. He would return in Octopussy.

For Your Eyes Only achieves this objective stylishly, recalling the more serious Bond films of the 60s and easily standing as the best of Roger Moore's seven outings as the secret agent.What makes the film work so well is the simplicity and realism of its story, probably the most realistic Bond plot since the classic From Russia with Love, eighteen years earlier. Rather than attempting to save the world from yet another megalomaniac supervillain, Bond's objectives here are much more straightforward, being simply to recover a British ATAC system from a sunken submarine before the Russians can get hold of it. This film therefore has the strongest Cold War element that the Bond franchise had seen in a long time, and OO7 actually has to do some real espionage work, something he had not bothered himself with too much during the 1970s. A novel feature of FYEO is that Bond actually has to work out who his enemy is, the choice coming down to the suave Kristatos and the wily Columbo, and the film does a good job confusing us as to which of them it is, until all is revealed.The film harks back to the early days of the Bond films in other ways, such as in the opening sequence where OO7 lays flowers on his wife's grave, and then battles with a Blofeld lookalike in a well-staged confrontation involving a helicopter over London. First-time Bond director John Glen, who would go on to make all the 80s Bond films, keeps the pacing tight and stages some excellent sequences, particularly a fabulous alpine ski chase and a memorable rock climbing scene. This is played out without any background music and is the most tense and gripping scene in a Bond film for years, as OO7 battles to keep his footing on the cliff as an enemy tries to dislodge him. We really sense that Bond is in danger in this scene, and it is nice to see OO7 look vulnerable after several films in which he appeared to be turning into an invincible superhero. For this Roger Moore deserves credit, because he tries hard here to give his Bond more depth, and make him more than just a comedian. It is probably his most serious performance in the role, and he is even prepared to show OO7's ruthless side by killing an enemy in cold blood, doing so quite effectively. It is a pity Moore didn't play Bond like this more often, because FYEO shows he had more to offer in the part than just one-liners and a raised eyebrow.The rest of the cast is largely impressive. Julian Glover's Kristatos is a refreshingly down-to-earth villain, interested in making money rather than destroying the world, and Topol's Columbo makes for a great, charismatic ally in the style of Kerim Bey from FRWL. Carole Bouquet is not a great actress, but she still makes for the best Bond girl since the 60s, coming across as a tough and self-assured woman, well capable of looking after herself and looking good at the same time. The one false note is struck by the teenage ice-skater Bibi, who is an irritating and frankly unnecessary character. Thankfully, the visibly-ageing Moore resists her charms; it would not have been a pretty sight if he had succumbed to them.FYEO does have a few other problems. Sheena Easton's title song is good, but Bill Conti's grating incidental music most certainly is not; indeed, it is probably the worst soundtrack to any Bond film. There is also still a lingering attachment to lame comedy in what is mostly a serious film, particularly in an ill-advised ending featuring lookalikes of Margaret and Denis Thatcher. Not only is this unfunny, but it spoils the tough and serious atmosphere the film had built up, and feels like a leftover from a 70s Bond. Overall however, FYEO ranks among the top Bond films, showing once again that OO7 tends to be at his best if he is put on a realistic assignment.

Wilson returned to the Ian Fleming stories, determined to bring Bond back to Earth; literally. The film succeeds fantastically, and while not the BEST Bond film; nothing can compare to OHMSS so far in the series; it is one of my top five Bond films and a very amusing Bond film.Roger Moore finally plays Bond right, although he's starting to look a little old. He was always intended to be the amusing Bond, but he never made me laugh before. Here, he does. It was especially amusing when Bond got stuck with a teenager! This Bond film gives a genuine flavor of comedy, but the film is not a comedy. It is very serious, and gives a bit of taste from Bond's original state in that he kills a man in cold blood. After rather dull Bond allies since OHMSS, we get a great, memorable one; Columbo, up in the ranks with Kermin Bay of FRWL and Marc Ange Draco of OHMSS. The fact that he's initally given as the film's villain is very interesting. The villain, Kristatos, is also one of the most dignified and charming villains in quite a while. This film pays respects to OHMSS, which up until then had been viewed as poor, in several ways. Bond visits the grave of his murdered wife, Tracy, in a very moving scene that was all too short. Bond has numerous skiing and boblsed scenes, and even dresses the same way he did in OHMSS. And we FINALLY get an interesting Bond girl. I divide the Bond girls into four groups; Tracy di Vicenzo's (Bond equals), Pussy Galore's (Very close to Bond equals), Anya Romanova's (Not equals, but still very interesting), and Tiffany Cases (Pretty, but of no use to the story). Melina ranks as a Pussy Galore, and believe me, it's been a while since we had one; since Goldfinger, to be precise. The plot is very good, amusing, and exciting, and seems like the kind of spy mission that actually occured during the Cold War. General Gogol's return, and the fact he keeps his own man from murdering 007 after destroying the ATAC controller for British submarines, is very touching in that, again, it shows that Russia was not the sterotypical evil nation it was painted to be then.There ARE a few problems with this film, however. The opening credits has an exciting feel, but the bald, wheelchair villain SUCKS!!! If they were trying to make Blofeld here and just not use his name, they failed with everything in capitals, in bold lettering, and large size. Other than the cat and the bald head, absolutely nothing in this film suggests we're dealing with Blofeld. He is not calm, quiet, and menacing; he laughs too much, he does NOT stay calm, and sounds nothing like any old Blofelds. If he IS Blofeld (which I doubt) then why the heck is he IN a wheelchair!? There are a couple of other things in the film; the stupid, spoiled teenager and the lack of the character of M (his Chief of Staff makes him look like a comedian), but the bald guy really brought the film from a 9 to a 8 and 1/2.

Bond does away with a certain bald nemesis whom I shall not name in case you have not had the pleasure of seeing this film. I will tell you that their confrontation comes right after Bond visits his wife's grave. The action scenes are great and Bond relies on his wits instead of gadgets to survive. There is a rock climbing scene that is intense! Bond also escapes villains while being pursued on skis and I particularly liked how he used a bob sled run during the same scene. There is a great scene where you think 007 is going to get away in his Lotus Turbo Esprit. Unfortunately for him the car is destroyed before he can use it. He is left with an old junky car I cannot even name. Rogers expression is hilarious when he sees the junk heap and realizes it is his only hope. The locations are as exotic as any I have seen in any Bond film to date. The beautiful Olympic Village located in Cortina is marvelous and the locations in Greece make you warm all over even on the coldest night by just looking at them. There is a scene where Roger gets to play Bond a bit more harsh than he usually does when he kicks a car off of a cliff while the villain begs and screams from inside the car. The underwater action is great too.  Lynn Holly Johnson (Ice Castles) as Bibi Dahl is fun to watch as she tries to seduce Bond. You may think this unlikely given her age, but it is bond she is after. Who can blame her??? I had the opportunity of meeting her a few years back. She is still beautiful as ever! Topol is awesome in his role as the gritty and street smart maritime smuggler who helps Bond achieve his goals. Juilan Glover is great as the lead villain. Carole Bouqet is a gem to watch as 007's love interest. What a hottie! Great film. All in all it is a fun movie with a great cast and a great title song performed by Sheena Easton.

This is especially true during the first forty minutes to an hour of the movie, throughout which my mind wandered quite a bit. The beginning sequence features a final appearance by Ernst Stavros Blofeld, with a neck brace and a wheelchair presumably a result of his last encounter with Bond in the poorly-done Diamonds are Forever, taunting Bond as he uses a remote control to fly Bond's helicopter around.  The scene was a nice way to finish off Blofeld for good (though I thought he'd bit the dust back in Diamonds when his fortress exploded), but it could have been done a LOT better.  Blofeld's pleas as he was hooked on the helicopter's landing gear were rather out of character, and his scream as he fell down the smokestack sounded very cartoonish.  In addition, it wasn't made at all clear that he was killed.  Throughout the rest of the movie, I was convinced that Blofeld would turn out to have been masterminded the entire operation, possibly in an attempt to revive SPECTRE.  Alas, it was not to be, and I was somewhat let down to see that his death was done so poorly. Getting back to the actual movie, I felt that for about the first half the pacing was rather odd.  It didn't seem to flow very neatly and I found it hard to stay focused.  Fortunately, the movie redeemed itself around the point where Bond discovers who the REAL villain is.  From that point forward it kept my attention and succeeded in being a decent Bond movie. While not the best of the series (that distinction goes either to The Spy Who Loved Me or On Her Majesty's Secret Service), For Your Eyes Only is a good addition and one that you should watch if you haven't yet.

But if you thought From Russia With Love was one of the best, you'll love this one.Bond gets a chance to show what he can do with almost no fancy gimmicks at all, and it works wonderfully. He finally resembles a resourceful agent instead of a cartoon character. A highly inventive and colorful car chase with a battered Citroen instead of a tech-heavy Lotus, a ski/motorcycle chase filled with incredible stuntwork, a breathtaking rock climbing sequence (but bring jummars next time, fella)...the humans are the special effects in this one. And they've kept me watching it more than any other Bond flick.The elegant and pensive Bond girl, Carole Bouquet, carries out her role with understated panache and is tremendously attractive and sympathetic. She even saves a few lives instead of screaming for help. If only the producers could always figure out the benefits of a Bond girl who's a real human being. As a Greek smuggler, Topol plants his tongue firmly in cheek the whole time and almost goes over the top, but he gets a great sequence assaulting an Albanian warehouse. The plot is touch-and-go (mostly go), the disco score is dated, and the figure skating character played by Lynn-Holly Johnson is a waste of time. But the reliance on actual characters and human skill instead of shallow computerized action sequences can't be beat, and the cinematography team had a field day.A flawed but delightful film with a lot to teach future Bond productions.

The massive sets and hi-tech gadgetry, the panto-like megalomaniac villains replaced by sinister Greek smugglers and the buxom beauty replaced by a haunted, revenge-seeking heroine.  The plot itself resembled Fleming's original stories, with Bond relentlessly pursuing the captors of the vital ATAC system, responsible for programming British submarines, running into orphaned but restless Melina Havelock along the way.  But, alas, the screenplay is considerably self-deprecating, overlooking much needed plot information and development for a never-ending series of action set-pieces, whilst still the allowing for out-of-place slapstick humour of recent films to creep in.  Nevertheless, Eyes Only is certainly not one of the series' weaker films thanks to fittingly in-tune cast performances, clever twists and a cracking cliff-hanging climax.

After the Moonraker disaster, those involved with the series decided to knuckle down and succeeded in creating a superlative spy thriller.  The plot centers around Bond's attempts at recovering the Atac ballistic missile system, sunk in an accident off the Albanian coast.  The plot is simple and allows for the character development of some great villains and Carole Bouquet's Melina, one of the top Bond heroines in the series.  There is little gadgetry.  The routine movie car chase is made more interesting as Bond is forced to outrun bad guys in a beat up heap instead of dominating with a trick car.  This works to the film's advantage as Bond is forced to improvise and show his skills.  Other action scenes such as the ski chase, are very exciting and entertaining with great music and camera shots.  The villains are seedy, double dealing and more realistic.  Carole Bouquet is a great Bond heroine who shows vulnerability as well as cold, traditional vengeance.  Roger Moore as Bond harkens back to Connery as he's given more opportunities to show his stuff with fewer silly quips then usual, although there are enough to lighten up the movie at times.  Topol's Columbo is also a solid character and is constructed along the same lines as Kerim Bey in From Russia With Love. M is missing as Bernard Lee died shortly before filming and his presence is missed.  The beginning is also a little hokey but exciting nonetheless.  This is a very serious Bond, one of the more tightly wrapped Bond's of the series and perhaps Moore's best performance.

Moore glances at the thugs in the other car! His Lotus Esprit was security protected and is blown up when someone tries to break in. Q provides some light relief. The scenes in Qs lab and the Identigraph system are funny. The Minister and Chief Of Staff are used as M is described as being on holiday. (In reality Bernard Lee had recently deceased). They are grumpy throughout. The end features Mrs. Thatcher and Denis lookalikes revealing Denis likes cabbages! Moore just gets away with his age. The wrinkles just beginning to appear and is thus able to be dignified in love scenes with women half his age. The action is more boxing orientated than martial arts!

While it may not be the best (From Russia With Love is), it shares what the others at the top of the list share--that the events could possibly take place. This is definitely Moore's best performance as Bond. To me, he never seemed dark enough an actor to be Bond. With the other four, you sensed that there was more to Bond. I haven't read enough of the books to know if it was Ian Fleming's intention for Bond to be an orphan as they said he was in Goldeneye, but I liked the idea. And Moore is the only one that doesn't seem like he could have had that kind of background. At least not from his work as 007. Anyway, this is one of the best bond movies and I highly recommend it.

As frustrated and annoying as I found Moonraker, I was joyfully relieved to see FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.  This is, for my money, the best of the Roger Moore segment in Bond history.WARNING POTENTIAL SPOILERS WITHIN TEXTWhen the teaser kicks things off, I groaned oh no, because it really seems hokey and silly.  Once Sheena Easton's title song fades, however, the movie starts taking shape.  This one is not about world domination or blowing up a major city.  It is a throwback to From Russia with Love, with Bond on the trail of a crucial piece of military defense hardware.  There is a pleasant Kerim Bey-like alliance formed between Bond and Colombo, (brilliantly played by Topol) a smuggler who at first appears to be Bond's rival.  Julian Glover portrays a subtle, yet evil enough heavy for this film and I have to admit there is a high schoolish cuteness to Lynn Holly Johnson as the skater who develops a crush on Bond.Most refreshing of all, is that Bond actually DOES seem to be in some real danger once again.  This hadn't happened in several movies preceding it. He is bashed around constantly, dangled from a cliff, cut on a coral reef, and chased down a ski slope by armed motorcyclists. In the past, you would see him fall into the water and almost come out in a fresh suit with blow-dried hair!!  This is a refreshing throwback to the early Connery days of Bond.  This one is DEFINITELY a cut above MOONRAKER, which had me questioning whether the series should continue. The footage in some of one chase is the best I've ever seen and it appears that the crew was really determined to pull this one off and lay its predecessor to rest.If I were to find any weak points with this movie, it would be that the soundtrack sounded silly back then and has become even more glaring when viewed today.  If I'm not mistaken, it's Bill Conti and not John Barry handling that aspect for this film.  That aside, this movie renewed my interest in what I felt was a series that had said just about all it had left to say.  For me, this one raised the bar and was the GOLDFINGER of the Roger Moore phase of 007.  The last few Roger Moore ones are pretty good, but I think he hit his peak in this one. Here, he is comfortable and believable without looking so stiff.  He still appears young enough to be able to bed a twenty-something actress without looking a bit perverted.

Along with The Spy Who Loved Me, FYEO features Roger Moore while at the top of his game (a combination of experience in playing Bond, without the serious signs of aging present in his later efforts).  For me, FYEO represents a Bond movie that, by virtue of its overall consistency, scores relatively high marks within the Bond series.  The supporting actors provide solid performances (accord, not great performances, such as Diana Rigg & Gabrielle Farinzie sic in OHMSS). The story line is taut and well-paced (unlike the over-the-top plots of, for example, Moonraker).  The movie provides perhaps the only example of a hardened and revengeful Moore as he kicks Locke's Mercedes off the cliff.

He was almost 60 years old and did not fit the role of James Bond as an age of a grandfather. After that Moore was (luckily) replaced by stiff Tim Dalton so this has to be the Best Bond of the decade.

With the pop remix of the theme tune and lip gloss in abundance, the eighties are definitely influential on this one, complete with Sheena Easton actually performing as well as singing the title song. Having said that, the movie is easily better than all the 70's vehicles, save for Live and Let Die.The pre-credits trailer actually shows a more thoughtful Bond, with a nice scene at his wife's grave. This leads to the final end of an unspecified Blofield, rather unceremoniously thrown down a chimney. Of course, behind the scenes this was a rather snide way of screwing up Kevin McClory's plans to create his own alternate Bond franchise by killing off it's main villain in the official series, but this detracts little.Another interesting note is Bond's pacificistic attitude towards Britain's defences. Coming from the navy himself, this may seem out of character for 007, but this coming to terms with his grief seems to lend the character doubt and a perhaps a little depth.However, this slightly more mature Bond, with less sex and violence, may be due to the fact that Roger was 54 when this was made, and looks absolutely haggard throughout most of the duration. Stunt work is spectacular, and works reasonably well with the dialogue sequences, which return to c.1967 in their complexity. Silliness is almost absent, and after an entire film of almost-straight playing, the Maggie Thatcher skit at the climax is forgivable. Plus, what other film would have the audacity to cast the wonderful Charles Dance in a non-speaking role?Finally, Brosnan fans may like to note that this is the first time Bond gets to do a bungee jump...

After the extravaganza of Moonraker it was a great move to make a more 'realistic' Bond with a more persuasive plot and antagonists. They found a good balance between the more serious and the humorous bits and made it a truly enjoyable experience.The 'serious' character of the film is reflected in the absence of any gadgets from Q and we even saw Bond push a man off a cliff in an emotional rage. On the brighter side, in a humorous opening scene we also saw him throw a villain into a chimney while he tries to placate Bond by offering to buy him a 'delicatessen in stainless steel'. Who could ever forget that line? Of course, we also have the funny bit with Margaret Thatcher at the end. Q's gadgets are compensated for by introducing some interesting devices on the side of the antagonists motorbikes with spikes, cool diving suits and deadly miniature submarines. The problems with the film revolve largely around the women. There is no chemistry between Bond and Melina and the character of Bibi is somewhat redundant. But there are also problems involving logic, notably at the very end where the British government for some reason doesn't rely on the help of the Greek army to stop a double agent from selling a vital piece of equipment to the Soviets. Also, the ending in a remote monastery is somewhat anti-climactic; the most intense and memorable scenes take place in Cortina and under water in the Adriatic Sea. The soundtrack to the film is excellent, one of the best in the Bond series.

I suspect that John Glen and the producers were aiming for a movie that was funny, fun with a little romance, but what they ended up with was a below-average flick. Once again, Roger Moore brought this film down as the icy, tired James Bond whose only purpose for living seems to be to get his pension, but he is not the only problem. This film lacks those fantastic sets from previous Bond films (like a volcano which really is an underground layer for the bad guys to plot world domination) and is filled with so many chases and fight scenes that do not mean anything that you get the sense that the producers are just wasting film.There were some good things about this movie. Topol's performance as the smuggler Draco is not bad. Carole Bouquet makes for a pretty Bond girl with sex appeal, though her performance as the woman seeking vengeance is completely implausible. Finally, Desmond Llewyn's Q is fantastic and we get some energy from Holly-Johnson as the sluttish and very sexy champion skater. Strangely enough, Bond did not sleep with her, which is another reminder that the hero and the series are getting really old and tired right about now. In short, while For Your Eyes Only is not terrible, its cons outweigh any pros.

Bond must team up with Melina, solve who the true ally is and find the ATAC before it's too late.And of course, lure Melina into his bed (or the ocean for some skinny dipping).For Your Eyes Only was originally meant to be the follow up to The Spy Who Loved Me but was sidelined in favor of Moonraker since the studio wanted the Bond franchise to cash in on the success of Star Wars from 1977. In the years since then, many Bond fans have come to regard Moonraker as one of the weakest Bond films, not just of the Moore era but in general. Following the disappointing Moonraker, we have this deliberate return to a more minimalist Bond adventure, with the winking at the audience style humor that defined the Moore era, and turned Bond into a parody of himself, is downplayed. Marred somewhat by the unnecessary inclusion of Holly Lynn Johnson as a horny young skater and the simple fact that by this point Roger Moore's age was really starting to show (he's actually 3 years older than Sean Connery to begin with), and as Moore himself later admitted, it was a mistake to stay with Bond as long as he did. Still, this is one of the better entries in the Roger Moore era, and would have been a nice swan song for him to retire on. Or possibly would have been a good start for Timothy Dalton, who would replace Moore as Bond in 1987.Excellent stunt work and the beautiful Carole Bouquet add to the magic.PS in this one, Bond finally got his revenge for the murder of his beloved wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service.

The story is more espionage/cold-war based and Bond is subdued and on task through the movie. In fact, I can think of only three primary drawbacks1. Moore has already had one of his face-lifts, and it doesn't look good. He is in his fifties and not aging well at this stage.2. The patented car chase scene is humorous, but unrealistic and considering they are running for their lives, there is a lot of smiling and giggling in the scene (and the car's a joke and would never have survived half of what is done to it).3. Lynn-Holly Taylor is absolutely annoying as Olympic figure-skating hopeful, puberty-is-hitting hard, Bibi Dahl. Any scene she is in just feels anywhere from awkward to absolutely annoying. The mute button is a wonderful feature when she is on screen. Though 22 at the time, she looks 15 and is supposed to be a teen- and is just irritating. Fortunately, the plot and storyline are some of the strongest writing and development in a Bond movie. The plot revolves around a British code encryption device called ATAC- which controls command authorization for the Royal Navy's Polaris missile submarines. Should one ATAC be found, anyone could order the Royal Navy to shoot their missiles anywhere. The device is lost when a British ship with the device is sunk off the coast of Greece. A chase between the Russians and Brits ensues. There is a wonderful plot twist and knowing who the real villains and allies are is tricky until the climaxes. Topol is great in his role as one of two Greek smugglers involved in the story, and Julian Glover (as Kristatos) is solid as the other. Carole Bouquet as Melina is the first really strong female lead since Honor Blackmon's Pussy Galore. She is not the bratty Holly Goodhead from Moonraker or the lame, overacting Barbara Bach XXX agent in The Spy Who Loved Me. Bond also shows some vindictiveness and determination not seen in several movies. In fact, the best scene is when Bond catches up with an enemy agent who has killed a few colleagues. Bond's cold justice is reminiscent of Connery's taking out Professor Dent in Dr. No. An excellent scene when the viewer gets to it. A good, fun example of the best of the formulaic Bond films, but well restrained after Moonraker. Bond gets to be an agent, and the story flows nicely. Definitely one of the easiest to watch.

It's absolutely brilliant from start to finish, mainly due to the excellent direction of John Glen and beautiful score by Bill Conti. One of my major attractions to the film is the soundtrack, which I believe to be Conti's best work since Rocky. The early 80's mixture of jazz and classic tones makes this soundtrack unforgettable.The film itself is eye-candy to any Bond fan. The locations in FYEO are some of the best we've seen in the franchise. The film spans from London, to Greece, to the beautiful Cortina in Italy.The opening sequence is one if the best of the series. We see Bond laying flowers at Tracy's grave, who we have barely heard of since OHMSS, followed by one of the best stunts in an opening scene. The chase is on when Bond is duped into getting into the Universal Exports helicopter by the unofficial Blofeld.Due to the failure of Moonraker, we see how down to earth FYEO is when it comes to plot and action. Although Moore is noticeably aged at this point, he pulls off the down to earth combination of style and substance with ease. Witty one liners and campy villains were left at the door as well. Let me make a point of saying that the Bond girl, Melina (Carole Bouquet), also added to the drastic change in style. Rather than being a useless sidekick used solely for Bond's pleasure, Melina added a grittiness to the plot that makes FYEO comparable to a Dalton film. Melina's back story with her father and the discovery of the St. Georges fuses amazingly with Bond's mission to recover the ATAC system.One of the major high points in FYEO, is not knowing who the actual villain is until the 2nd act of the movie. Aristotle Kristatos (played by the amazing Julian Glover) and Milos Columbo (Topol) play the perfect cold war rivals. By the latter half of the film, three of the major characters (Melina, Bond, and Kristatos) are all on the trail of Kristatos.The action sequences were intense and extremely climactic. Locque and Kriegler's pursuit of Bond on the ski slopes was nothing short of brilliant. Beginning high atop the ski-jump and commencing through the beautiful snowy mountain range, this sequence has gone down in the record books. One part of this scene that I always enjoy pointing out is when Bond ruthlessly places the ski pole on the branch of the tree, knowing the ultimate outcome. That is easily one of the most brutal deaths throughout the film.Who says Bond doesn't kill in cold blood? Emile Locque's death came as no surprise, but was pretty brutal. Preceding Locque's death, Bond says an unforgettable line You left this with Ferrara, I believe.. A line like this brilliantly sums up the theme of FYEO revenge The ending of FYEO is one scene that has every Bond fan on the edge of their seat. Beginning with Bond's ascent to Kristato's mountaintop hideaway in St. Cyrils, the climax already has us drawn in. While the premise is a classic Bond evasive tactic, it is unique in every possible way. Rather than bringing in backup and forcing Kristatos to surrender the ATAC by using air tactics, Bond climbs his way up the mountainside. The scene ends with Kriegler's well deserved 'drop off' and the death of Kristatos which was absolutely poetic. He died in the manner that he lived, as a sneak.9.5/10 "},{"Title":"The Best Of Bond","Date":"15 January 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" For Your Eyes Only is one of the best 007 films.

Moore's films were more light-hearted, slapstick and rather silly than previous films. In some of the movies it doesn't work well (like Moonraker or View to A Kill), however in this movie it works wonderfully.One of the strengths of this film is the plot. 007 must retrieve a missing ATAC system which is pivotal to British Defense. It's not about narcotics or cheesy-space domination, it's a classic cold-war showdown of UK vs USSR in trying to recover or obtaining the device. Another strength is the wonderful locations, either Spain, Italy, Albania or Greece, 007 moves so actively throughout the story that by the end you'll be amazed he accomplished so much in only 2 hours.Another strength is the great action scenes. Whether by helicopter, on skis, underwater, or in a hockey rink, the action sequences are not to be missed, especially the climatic ending at St. Cyrills. It is one of my favorite sequences in the whole franchise. There are great ensemble characters as well, Kristados, Topol, and Locque make a great addition to the movie.However, considering this is a Roger Moore film you know there is gonna be a little cheese. The open sequence is a little slapstick, especially considering how important Blofeld was for the first 15 years of the franchise. The 80s music and cars is humorous (can't really penalize that because of the times), the Identograph, Moneypenny looking very old, the parrot, Margaret Thatcher and the actresses performances (neither Carole Bouquet nor Lynn-Holly Johnson were memorable, Lynn-Holly Johnson was border line annoying), yet despite these few mishaps the film still works.John Glen (director) and Richard Maibaum (screenwriter) had a great combination of action, plot and pace. This is one of those movie that whenever it's on TV I get sucked into. It is definitely one of my favorite Roger Moore films and it is in the upper-half of all James Bond movies.

Apart from its not very detailed technology and political games, this could almost be a Tom Clancy's novel!Added to this, the traditional Moore's sense of humor, the great action sequences (like the ski descent and the yellow Citroen chase) and really evil villains(Kristatos is a cold blooded murderer, with no respect for life, not a fool idealist like Blofeld), all mixed up, become a really great spy movie, where Roger Moore makes a great performance, leaving the slightly goofy Bond of Live and Let Die way behind!

His missions usually involved the potential destruction of empires - or even the world - at the hands of nefarious megalomaniacs. Interestingly, the makers of the Bond movies had arrived at a sort of stalemate after the 1979 entry Moonraker. In that film, 007 had literally pursued the bad guy to outer space and saved the entire planet from extinction. How could they top that? What could be bigger than such a spectacular space adventure? The Bond makers came up with a wise and effective solution for the next film by returning to the old-fashioned roots of their series. In For Your Eyes Only, 007's quest is nothing so grand and noble as sawing the planet - he merely has to prevent a top-secret computer from falling into the wrong hands. This understated approach actually results in the best Bond film in years.A trawler posing as a fishing vessel, but in actuality a British Navy spy ship, sinks off Greece when it accidentally hits an unexploded wartime mine. Aboard the vessel is a top-secret computer called the A.T.A.C, which effectively protects the entire British fleet. A respected marine scientist is recruited to help the British find the sunken ship but is mysteriously murdered before completing his work. James Bond (Roger Moore) is sent to investigate the murder. He quickly establishes that another party is involved in the hunt for the ship and its priceless A.T.A.C. But who is this mysterious party? Could it be Greek smuggler Columbo (Topol), out to make a little money? Or perhaps the enigmatic Kristatos (Julian Glover), a double agent who may be planning to sell the computer to the Russians? Bond teams up with the marine scientist's beautiful daughter Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet) and together they track the A.T.A.C to a mountain-top monastery, where they must prevent it from falling into the wrong hands thereby jeopardising the effectiveness of the British naval defences.For Your Eyes Only marked the Bond debut of director John Glen (although he had worked as editor on earlier 007 entries). Glen went on to make five 007 films in a row, which is a record (no other director made five films in the series - although Guy Hamilton managed four - and the fact that they came out consecutively makes Glen's contribution doubly remarkable). The action is crisply filmed and edited, including a remarkable ski sequence and a stunning mountain climbing sequence in which Bond is almost thrown to his death. Another memorable scene features Bond and Melina being dragged on a rope by a boat over a coral reef. The reef cuts and grazes their flesh and the drifting blood attracts the nearby sharks!! Bill Conti (of Rocky fame) provides an exciting if dated score, and the theme tune is powerfully performed by Sheena Easton. Although I like Octopussy best among Moore's Bond films, For Your Eyes Only is definitely a contender. If you prefer the older-style 007 films, it is certainly an interesting and effective throwback to the films of that ilk.

I've heard many fans complain about the fact that the series eliminated his major nemesis so quickly, but come off it guys! That whole SPECTER premise was tired and played out at that point, so it was high time that they ended that aspect of the series once and for all! I'm surprised this wasn't mentioned by many comments in IMDb, but it's easy to overlook since it has no bearing on the rest of the movie.As for the rest of the film, it takes a very leisurely pace in revealing the story line, with all it's plot twists and turns. There is plenty of REALLY good action in the film, with no help from CGI affects. And best of all, the action is pertinent! They don't just throw it in for looks.Once again, character and story development takes precedence over wiz-bang action. All of the characters are thoroughly put thru their paces so that you actually care about what they think and why they are the way they are. You see this even in the little things, like seeing the Russian Intelligence Gen. Gogol show up (played by Walter Gotell), if ever so briefly, at the beginning and at the end of this film. Most people don't remember him playing the 2nd. bad guy on the left in From Russia w/Love, but he came back in The Spy Who Loved Me, and had that same recurring role thru the 70s and 80s. Bond films always benefit from continuity, and the fact that the writers stayed true to this (even in the not-so-good Bond films) makes any Bond film MANY TIMES better than your avg. action flick.I will agree, the music is dated, but jeez, it's almost 25 years old, guys! Lighten up and enjoy the ride, because it is a good one.So, to summarize good story/plot and characterization, lots of well-filmed action, some humor...but not overdone with needless puns, a minimum of gadgetry usage (again).

With true Bond dry humor they make off in the little yellow Citroen 2CV6. Now this car has twin cylinder 602cc engine, a top speed of 71mph and only 28.5 horse power!The chase is spectacular - twisty zig zag bends down a Spanish hill side and in hot pursuit are a fleet of Peugeot 504 cars, themselves now a classic. Numerious crashes, air bound maneuvers and gun fire make it unforgettable. The little 2CV take to the off road, demonstrating the amazing suspension system of Citroen.

Nonetheless it's the least fantastical, most coherent of Roger Moore's films as the spy. Extrapolating from Fleming's eponymous short tale of vengeance, the feature incorporates familiar Cold War shenanigans and exotic combative set pieces. Part of the success of the action is that the ambition is not with spectacle but detail. Fights underwater at close-quarters, in a warehouse and in an extended, comic winter-sports chase (Bond taking the piste, if you like) make the case.The cast is a cut above. Topol understands his Guignol role, allowing Glover to play a straightforwardly slimy baddie (reprised, almost exactly, in his Indiana Jones appearance at the other end of the decade). Bouquet is appealing, even credible on screen although her mouth moves in a funny synch with her lines (possibly increasing that appeal). Moore is now too old for Bond, evinced in the cringe-worthy sub-marine temple excavation scene, supposedly cementing the warmth between the couple but simply framing his wrinkles. Still, this role fits Moore better than any other, allowing him genuine tenderness but also occasional cruelty towards the women as well as indulging his own fluency with southern European sensibility.Bill Conti's score is as broad, modern and carefully tailored as anything offered by John Barry; his title song, a restless, yearning power ballad was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. Even the subplots pull together. If only some of the expository asides weren't so blatant and the comedy so self-conscious. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Moore's best Bond film.","Date":"4 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  This film returns to the depiction of Bond as what he should be an official government enforcer, rather than the playboy of other films.

Bond himself is less cartoonish and silly than he had been for a while, and the more realistic action scenes (especially the thrilling mountain climax) create more suspense. The goofy car chase early on is a disgrace, and the ski chase goes a bit too far, but there are some really good moments in the action (especially in the ski chase). There are also a lot of funny moments that aren't too silly. As for the actors, Kristatos is okay, but his blonde henchman is befittingly intimidating. Carole Boquet is a lovely and beautiful Bond girl who, pleasantly, doesn't look like a cheap Barbie doll.

The filmmakers went for something sincere here, using the Fleming books for more than title fodder and adding many interesting wrinkles of their own. They had just made their biggest box office killing with the last Bond release, the ridiculous and formulaic Moonraker, so changing direction and respecting Bond's roots was a noble effort worth applauding.I love Roger Moore in this film. He was my favorite Bond and really plays the role wonderfully here, with balanced measures of humor and grit. Topol is also great, and leaves you sort of wonder how come he doesn't land more good roles like this and the lead in Fiddler on the Roof. Julian Glover makes a fine baddie, especially since he has to play his villainy closer to reality than other fiends in the series like Dr. No and Goldfinger.There are some great moments here, though they are mostly small ones that catch your notice because they aren't what you expect in a Bond movie. The novelty of Bond actually turning down a roll in the hay with some nubile lovely because she's too young is quite funny, as is Bond's paternalistic chagrin when the girl laughingly tells him she's no virgin. (Moore's reaction shots here and throughout the movie are really good.)And how many other times did we ever see Bond become stalled as he infiltrated his enemy's lair in order to bind some minor character's wounds (and a bad guy at that?) It's funny because the director lets it drag out a bit and break up the rhythm while it adds to the suspense.The action scenes in the film are a mixed bag. The car chase up and down a Spanish olive field is well-done and cleverly staged, with Bond again working against our expectations by utilizing a canary-yellow Citreon. I like the standoff at Kristatos' warehouse, too, it's tense and vivid and has a great payoff. But the ski chases around Cortina drag on too long, and the less said about that silly hockey fight the better.The plotting is solid but draggy, there are lots of choppy edits (unusual since the film's director is an accomplished editor) and the Bill Conti score is often annoying. (The title song he did with Sheena Easton was lovely, though, and a film highlight.) And while Bond women have seldom shown off sharp acting skills, Carole Bouquet is wooden enough to have you looking for termites in that long hair of hers.For Your Eyes Only is Bond atypically presented in a minor chord, and lacks the high thrills and big payoffs of other 007 movies. But for aficionados, and Moore fans, it's a film worth treasuring. Just make sure that you don't show this one first to someone you're trying to turn onto 007.

There's a segment of the 007 fan population that frowns on the Roger Moore era of films because of its notorious campiness. This, the twelfth film in the Eon series, is the exception to the role as what is arguably the only serious film in Moore's run. It might also be the most forgettable of the bunch, with only a handful of moments that come to mind after having not watched it in a while. I revisited the film again recently and came to remember that it's actually a pretty solid film. The film opens with a British ship going down in the Aegean Sea after an encounter with an old sea mine. The ship, while unassuming from the outside, was actually carrying an important bit of military hardware known as the ATAC (Automated Targeting Attack Communicator). This device allows British nuclear submarines to coordinate in the event of nuclear launch. The British have asked the Havelocks, a married couple and archaeologists skilled in underwater operations, to assist in finding the missing ATAC/ship and they are soon assassinated for their efforts. James Bond is assigned to find the man who murdered the Havelocks and track down the ATAC unit before it can fall into the wrong hands. Meanwhile, the Russians have quite an interest in the ATAC, as it would allow them to turn England's own nuclear weapons against it.As this is a Bond film, it's probably best to break it down into the core elements of the series. First, the Bond woman Melina Havelock (Carole Bouquet). Melina is one of the stronger Bond women of the series. She witnessed the murder of her parents and she's engaged on her own course of revenge, following the trail of criminals and murderers until she finds the man who ordered their deaths. Armed with a crossbow, her crossing paths with 007 on her vendetta was inevitable. She's focused on her girl and there are none of the usual flirtations between her and Bond. She's a beautiful woman and she's serviceable in the role as a woman bent on revenge but she's not the most emotive actress. Not here, at least. She can come across as dull and, as a result, forgettable amidst the sea of other Bond women, past and future, who left their mark on the series. I suppose you could consider the character of Bibi Dahl (Lynn- Holly Johnson) another Bond girl but her role in the film is nothing more than a means of exposition to introduce the evil henchman Erich Kriegler (John Wyman), a Russian Olympic athlete and another in a long line of tall, blonde, near silent killers in the film series. Bibi is an aspiring Olympic ice-skater sponsored by the film's villain and probably could have been cut from the film without losing anything important. Then again, we would have lost the film's only real moment of humor when she attempts to seduce Bond and he, recognizing their drastic (and uncomfortable) age difference, politely turns her down.The most interesting element of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is pulled from the Ian Fleming short story Risico. In the course of his investigation, Bond encounters a couple of smugglers and must determine which he can trust. The first is Aristotle Kristatos (Julian Glover). Bond is introduced to Kristatos through his Italian contact and Kristatos seems an honorable enough man at first. He warns Bond of his former colleague Milos Columbo (Topol), a bloodthirsty criminal known as the Dove. This bit of who can you trust is the a nice element that gives the film a more legitimate espionage vibe that we get in most of the Moore 007 films, even if it's only brief. The film's villain (whether it be Kristatos or Columbo&#x85;I won't specify in the event someone reading this hasn't seen the movie) is well done but there's nothing special about him to help him stand out against the likes of Kanaga, Scaramanga, or Max Zorin. There's nothing fanciful or absurd about him or his plan; it's all very grounded in reality. The same with the film. Expect little to no gadget action on 007's part. But it works. FOR YOUR EYES ONLY proves a Roger Moore 007 movie can still be entertaining without the goofiness. I'd even put above THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN and MOONRAKER, perhaps even A VIEW TO A KILL. The locations are gorgeous, the action is great, and Moore brings his usual brand of charm. It's not the best of the Moore era but I don't think it's as weak as many people seem to remember. "}{"Title":"An excellent, old fashioned Bond film which brings the series back down to Earth","Date":"5 July 2014","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" After the decent but overblown Moonraker which strayed too far from the Bond formula, the producers brought the series back down to Earth with this taut, very plausible thriller in the style of Dr. No, From Russia with Love and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Perhaps the most serious Roger Moore film to date, it features more believable characters and less grandiose schemes than destroying the vast majority of the world's population. While it was not as enjoyable as Goldfinger or The Spy Who Loved Me, it is a grittier and more realistic film than most of its other predecessors.At 53, Moore was a bit too old to play Bond by this time but he continues to be as impressive as ever, once again excelling at playing the charming, lovable rogue. The film also features some very good dramatic acting on his part, though I still think that the best example of that in the series is the scene in The Spy Who Loved Me when he discusses killing Sergei with Anya. Carole Bouquet, who previously auditioned for the role of Holly Goodhead in Moonraker, is excellent as Melina Havelock, following in the tradition of the best Bond girls as a strong, capable and intelligent woman who does not always need Bond to come to her rescue. In fact, when the characters first meet, she comes to his aid with her crossbow. Much like Anya, she is given a very strong story arc in which she seeks vengeance for the brutal murder of her parents. She does not hesitate to kill Hector Gonzales, the actual assassin, but Bond convinces her not to kill his paymaster Aris Kristatos, an intervention which leads to a wonderfully appropriate ending for that character. These scenes are very well written and Melina always comes across as a real person. She has strong chemistry with Moore but, oddly enough, there's no real suggestion of any romantic attraction until the final scene in which they go skinny dipping. I'm not sure whether or not this has anything to do with the fact that Carole Bouquet was almost 30 years Moore's junior, the biggest ever age gap between the actors playing Bond and the main Bond girl, but it helps to make the threat posed by Kristatos - and hence the plot - seem more real.Like many of his predecessors, Julian Glover is both charismatic and menacing as the cultured but treacherous Greek shipping magnate Aris Kristatos. While his scheme to sell the ATAC to the Soviet Union is rather low key by Bond villain standards, the methods that he uses in order to carry it out are just as brutal. Although he received the King's Medal from the British government for his role in fighting the Nazis, he was actually a double agent and attempts to pin his crimes, past and present, on his enemy Milos Columbo. Speaking of Columbo, he is played wonderfully by Topol. Although Columbo does not smuggle heroin, he does smuggle quite a few other things including gold and diamonds, meaning that he was one of Bond's less savoury allies - something which makes him all the more interesting. Topol is very engaging in the role of Columbo, one of the most charismatic and memorable Bond allies since Kerim Bey in From Russia with Love. The subplot about Columbo's 35 year rivalry with Kristatos is very compelling. It's a shame that Columbo never returned in future Bond films as he would have been a great asset to them.With Bernard Lee's death before he could film his scenes as M, the character is written out of the film rather than recast out of respect. As Chief of Staff Bill Tanner, James Villiers keeps his seat warm before Robert Brown's debut as M in Octopussy. Villiers is very good as the utterly humourless Tanner, becoming as exasperated with Bond as M often did in the previous eleven films. In her twelfth Bond film, Lois Maxwell was the only on screen survivor of Dr. No in the wake of Lee's death. While she has less screen time than in several of the earlier films, she is given some of her best material of the Moore era. For the first time since Moore assumed the role, Moneypenny's relationship with Bond is genuinely flirtatious and it's a delight to see the return of their banter after many a year. In spite of the almost total absence of gadgets (at least in the field) from the film, Desmond Llewelyn is as wonderful as ever as Q, delivering the best line in the film while disguised as a priest in Greece. Geoffrey Keen and Walter Gotell are once again very impressive as Sir Frederick Gray and General Gogol respectively. While Gogol is once again underused, I loved his rather nonchalant reaction to losing the ATAC and the fact that he has gone from enemy to ally since the previous two films is a nice reminder of the precarious and changeable nature of Soviet relations with the West. Among the other supporting actors, Cassandra Harris - future Bond Pierce Brosnan's wife from 1980 until her early death in 1991 - stands out the most as Countess Lisl von Shlaf (from Liverpool), the film's sacrificial lamb, while Lynn-Holly Johnson is very likable and quite funny as Bibi Dahl, even though her character doesn't add much to the film. Michael Gothard and Charles Dance were suitably menacing as Locque and Claus but it would have been nice if they had been developed and given personalities, particularly in the case of Locque. Overall, this is an extremely good Bond film in which the series returns to its roots after the rather unrepresentative Moonraker. It hearkens back to the early Bond films and I loved that.

For Your Eyes Only had to be more back to basics and is Moore's Best Bond.The plot concerns the sinking of British spy ship St George, which contains the defence computer ATAC( in the film resembling a Sinclair ZX81), and Bond's attempts to retrieve it from the wreck and find out who was behind the sinking. Also the teaser is first rate with Bond finally catching up with Ernst Blofeld and killing him off for murdering his wife in 1969 after three attempts on his life, the elusive head of SPECTRE is finally eliminated and we never hear of SPECTRE again in the films.Indeed there are so many good action plot twists and stunts in Eyes, I'll outline my favourites. First and foremost and typical to Moore's portray of Bond as a lighter figure is the car chase where rather than use his Lotus, which has been blown up, Bond resorts to a very underpowered Citroen 2CV which he uses to escape and eliminate a gang of killers in two bigger and faster cars. Also excellent is the fight against a group of ice hockey players working for the villain Christatos, the underwater scenes where Bond has to find ATAC, and the final fight scenes at the monastery where Bond takes on Christatos and his henchmen. ( For all he is rather understated compared with other Bond villains, Julian Glover was excellent as the double crossing drug dealer and Soviet agent Christatos).Also for all the corny humour is still around, this time Moore makes his Bond more ruthless. Blofeld, for all he is crippled in the film and begs for his life, offering Bond a stainless steel delicatessen if he spares his life, is killed off without any emotion and the psychotic gangster, Emile Locque, is shot inside his car and for all he is still alive, Bond shows no qualms about pushing him over a cliff.  He never had a head for heights, is the dark quip Bond makes as he observes the dead Locque.On the whole, apart from a cheesy disco soundtrack, Eyes is Moore's finest moment as Bond and won back some of the cynical fans. However, all the goodwill was blown by the OTT and ridiculous Octopussy, which to me was a low point in Moore's career as Bond.

This is a bit of a double edged sword, as being based on Fleming's writings gives more depth and realism to the character, but it also means the the plot is a bit scattershot, coming from so many different sources.Roger Moore is good as Bond, and always amusing to watch, but even here he was a bit too old for the role, and when equally long-in-the-tooth Moneypenny is on-screen, it's like I'm watching someone's grandparents flirting with each other. A geriatric Q doesn't help matters either.Good action, a good car chase after Bond runs into Malena, good ski sequences are all beneficial to the film; Bond's attack by hockey players was well done, but the running joke with the scoreboard nearly sunk it.Beautiful on-location photography in Italy and the Mediterranean. I like that they pull the rug out from under us, and make us unsure of who the real villain is and who is to be trusted. Bond's real ally in the film does not even appear until midway, and he turns out to be one of the more memorable allies since Kerim Bey.

So where to take James Bond was back to his roots and back to reality with For Your Eyes Only.The movie is a straight up spy thriller with Roger Moore probably giving his best and most underrated portrayal as Bond.

Sure the location didn't look great (why the hell would Blofeld kidnap Bond from a lovely little rural churchyard to take him to the isle of Dogs to kill him?) But it was Blofeld! And with a great accent (ignoring Charles Gray's but what can you do?). What was the point about bribing Bond with a delicatessen, though? At least it referred to a point in Bond's past which is usually ignored and yet created the man. That out of the way, where to start... Worst car chase scene of any Bond with the obligatory upside-down car being hit side-on. Why on earth the pursuers shoot at him from behind but constantly insist on trying to ram his car of the road instead of shooting his head off is beyond me. As usual with this period film, day turns to night and vice-versa with alarming (ir)regularity. Malena sees parents shot to death from an aeroplane right in front of her and she simply looks into the sky with a look as if to say she's thinking what she did with her car keys. And how does she have the resources to hunt after trained professionals throughout Europe, whether in Spain, Italy or Greece? And what is it with her crossbow?! Unbelievable escapes from people on motorised vehicles shooting machine-gun fire at prey etc. As usual with Moore films, one can only shrug as he suddenly shoots up in the air on skis and hits someone who happens to be, however improbably, in his trajectory. This happens twice or thrice i this film. Terrible late 70s-style TV music; compare with the lush David Arnold score in the latest film.

It is very hard to make a bad Bond movie. Even the worst I have seen from the series(Die Another Day) is not really bad, just mediocre. But nearly all Bond films have there flaws. So while I do have a few complaints about FYEO I did enjoy it, even a little more than the other Moore Bond film I have seen, Moonraker. For Your Eyes Only is a little more serious than Moonraker. First of all, the plot is not as preposterous. In fact its actually sort of realistic (for a Bond Film). I will admit despite my enjoyment of Moonraker, it did get a little silly and occasionally tiresome (not very often though).One of FYEO weakness's is the music. It is inferior to the excellent score created by John Barry for Moonraker. The music is adequate but not much more. The title song is just ok. As good as Moore was in Moonraker, he is clearly superior here. Moore is not as good as Connery but with his performance here he definitely comes close to that level. Some fans say that this is his best performance as Bond. I have not seen his other Bonds but I find it pretty unlikely that this performance will be surpassed by any of is others. The supporting cast is mixed. Topol makes a pretty good sidekick for Bond. Carole Bouquet is extremely beautiful as Bond's love interest, well actually she is more of a partner. Julian Glover is fine as the bad guy but he will not exactly standout as the most memorable Bond villain. Michael Gothard looks evil as the henchman but does not exactly do much. Desmond Llewyn (Spelling?) has some funny moments with Bond. The action sequences are well done. My favorite being the ski sequence. Bond's Lotus is awesome (I love that car). In this department, theres not much to be disappointed about. There is one other minor flaw with the film. There is a subplot involving Bond and the niece of the Bad Guy. Its occasionally funny but if it had been cut it would have made FYEO a tighter movie. It does not make it too long by any means, but it would have been slightly better if it was cut.I definitely recommend FYEO to any Bond fan. It is definitely an enjoyable experience. Perhaps after I see the rest of Moore's Bonds, this will end up as the best one.

He's violent, somewhat unforgiving, loving the thrill of danger and yet he is a gentleman. The story is taken right out of Fleming's short story Risico and was basically remade in The Living Daylights 6 years later (which incidentally is better). I enjoy the fact that this film no longer makes fun of itself, it no longer makes a joke out of the character whom we all love and admire. The Moore films (through no fault of his own) for me are not what Bond is supposed to be and have warped many people's minds to what Bond is and yet For Your Eyes Only is a little oasis in between the shenanigans of Moonraker and the boredom of A View to a Kill. Julian Glover is good as the villain, but the main reason why I love this is the story. It is intelligent without being complicated and it keeps you interested. We'll forget about the fiasco of an opening, and sure this isn't a brilliant film but it does all the right things.

Indeed, For Your Eyes Only qualifies as a throwback to On Her Majesty's Secret Service and From Russia with Love because both of those Bond epics emphasized realism rather than larger-than-life fantasy. Mind you, For Your Eyes Only doesn't entirely shun the conspicuous use of gadgets. The gadgets belong to the villains and are not designed to get Bond out of a corner. For Your Eyes Only represents the first of the five Bonds that veteran editor and second-unit action director John Glen would helm. Glen went on to call the shots on Octopussy, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights, and License to Kill. Rocky composer Bill Conti replaced John Barry to left the franchise after Moonraker but returned for Octopussy. The eponymous Sheena Easton theme song written by Michael Leeson garnered nominations for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe but later won an ASCAP award, while the Richard Maibaum & Michael G. Wilson screenplay received a Writers Guild of America nomination for best comedy adapted from another medium. Considering all the scrapes that 007 usually finds himself in, For Your Eyes Only amounts more to a comedy than a straight arrow adventure feature. Incidentally, Maibaum and Wilson adapted two short stories from the Fleming anthology of short stories, principally the title story and Risico for the film. Interestingly, they went back to Fleming's Live and Let Die novel and recycled the keelhauling sequence as well as the identigraph sequence from Goldfinger. The allusion to On Her Majesty's Secret Service is no mistake because the story begins with Bond laying flowers on his late wife's grave at the outset when a helicopter arrives to pick him up. Bond senses something sinister is in the works after he boards the helicopter and notices that the priest is crossing himself ceremoniously. Not long afterward, 007 learns that his old nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld has returned to haunt him. Indeed, the last time we saw Blofeld in OHMSS, he had his neck in a brace and Blofeld wears a neck brace here and sits in a wheelchair with a sophisticated console of switches, toggles, and gears is set in front of him. Blofeld kills the pilot and control the chopper himself, taking Bond on a harrowing ride through an industrial section of London that jeopardizes our hero. Nevertheless, our resourceful hero manages to climb out of the rear chopper compartment and gain control of the whirlybird, scoop Blofeld up on a ski and dump him into a towering smoke stack never to be heard of again at least for the next ten Bond movies.The scene shifts to the Ionian Sea near the coast of Albania where the MI6 spy ship masquerading as the St. Georges trawler catches an old naval mine in its nets and sets off the explosive device as it reels it in and it contacts the hull. Before the personnel aboard can destroy the ATAC, automatic targeting attack communicator, the ship sinks and everybody dies. Essentially, the ATAC enables the Defense Ministry to communicate with and coordinate its fleet of Polaris submarines. The fear is that the St. Georges hasn't sunk deep enough to discourage the Soviets from diving for the ATAC. If the Soviets were to get their hands on the ATAC then they could use the device to fire the ballistic missiles against any prominent western cities. British Intelligence immediately contacts Sir Timothy Havelock (television actor Jack Hedley), a marine archaeologist in Greece conducting underwater excavations and requests him to recover the ATAC. Before he can initiate operations, a ruthless Cuban hit-man, Hector Gonzales (Stefan Kalipha of Cuba), uses his seaplane to strafe the Havelock's yacht, and murders them after delivering their daughter, Melina (French actress Carole Bouquet) to the ship. Melina survives and swears vengeance.Since actor Bernard Lee had recently died, the role of M had not filled so Bond receives his orders to retrieve the ATAC from Chief of Staff Bill Tanner (James Villiers of Murder at the Gallop) and he sneaks into Spain and tries to learn who hired Gonzales. The Cuban's cohorts capture Bond and are about to execute him when Melina shows up with a cross-bow and liquidates Gonzales. Bond and she lead the villains on a merry chase through in the most unlikely of cars, a Citroen 2CV&#x97;it looks like a French sneaker--, through the woods after his Lotus blows up. It seems that thug tampered with it and its alarm triggered the explosion.Bond identifies the man at Gonzales' estate who paid the Cuban off as Locque and the trail leads 007 to a prominent Greek entrepreneur and sometime espionage informant, Aris Kristatos (Julien Glover) in the northern Italian resort town of Cortina d'Ampezzo in the Dolomites. Kristatos lies to Bond and tells him that Locque works for Miles Columbo (Topol of Fiddler on the Roof), a notorious Greek smuggler. Later, we learn that Columbo is the good guy and Kristatos is the treacherous villain leading the opposition to seize the ATAC. He tries to kill Melina and 007 after they raise the ATAC by dragging them behind his yacht, but Bond's ingenuity allows our hero and heroine to escape. This is a pretty suspenseful scene among several in For Your Eyes Only. There are a couple of exciting motorcycle chases on ice that will have you gnawing your fingernails as the villains pursue Bond. There is an extraneous subplot involving a young skater (Lynn Holly Johnson) that is embarrassing and seems designed to poke fun at 007.For Your Eyes Only is a good (better than Live and Let Die) but after the magnificent Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker, rather a letdown.

See for example the ski and the beach scenes (tributes to OHMSS), whereas the ATAC system reminds us to the Lektor machine (of FRWL).

In everything from its opening sequence, that has Bond placing flowers on the grave of his late wife, to the staging of its action sequences there is a sense that the events occurring in this film, above all other Bond excursions, are quite plausible. And, the fact that Bond himself does not, for once, save the world, but merely aids in preservation of its currency, in retrospect foreshadows the current downgrading in 007's status from super human, to just an action guy with really cool gadgets. In retrospect, this film is also notable for the appearance of the late first wife of future Bond star, Pierce Brosnon; Cassandra Harris as Countess Lisl. Esthetically, For Your Eyes Only also marks a first for Bond films, featuring the transparent ghost of Sheena Easton singing the title track against the credit sequence.The MGM/UA anamorphic widescreen DVD presents a quite pleasing visual experience. Colors are somewhat muted and dated, but nicely balanced. Contrast levels are a tad weaker than expected, but overall adequately presented. Fine details are realized during most of the daytime scenes. Nighttime location shots are less satisfactory, often appearing softly focused or slightly hazy.

Broccoli, director John Glen, and new screenwriter Michael G. Wilson (Broccoli's stepson) wisely chose to scale the next Bond film way down to the modest trappings of From Russia With Love, basically by stealing the same plot. And while For Your Eyes Only doesn't reach that level of greatness (no Bond film has since 1963), Roger Moore's fifth effort is still an exciting, unique, and fun way to spend 2 hours.As mentioned, the plot is extremely simple a secret spy ship, which was carrying the ATAC decoding machine, sinks off the coast of Greece and a British researcher is murdered while looking for it. James Bond is sent to follow up on a lead, stop the evil villains looking for the ATAC, and find it himself before it gets into the wrong hands. While on the mission, he encounters the daughter of the researcher, Melina (Carole Bouquet, who is actually a bit stiff) and stumbles onto a war between two former friends.With any Bond film, there has to be some action scenes, and FYEO is chock full of them. There's a wild and unusual car chase, a raid on a shipping port trafficking drugs, a thrilling climb up to the villain's base, and probably the best ski chase in a Bond film that also takes advantage of a bobsled run. Not one of these disappoint, and the stunt co-coordinators should be proud.It was a bit hard to lure Moore back into the role, but it was well worth whatever they paid him. He gives in what is probably his best performance, with some genuine and rare emotion. One scene that Sir Roger even objected to shows what Bond really is, an assassin, and that's when he kicks a car with an unarmed man over the edge of a cliff. Even with this new hard edge, he still finds a way to be charming and his usual funny self in some other moments, even if he has aged more noticeably since his last film. He even gets into some very physical fight scenes which are heavily appreciated.The movie contains a well-rounded cast that includes Topol as Columbo, Julian Glover as the two-faced Kristatos, Michael Gothard as the silent Locque, and Pierce Brosnan's wife Cassandra Harris as Countess Lisl von Schlaf. While Locque is pretty creepy, Kristatos doesn't really pose much of a threat to Bond. Nothing wrong with the actor, but he doesn't have the gravitas one needs to be a Bond villain. Neither does his henchman, Erich Kriegler, who is an inferior carbon copy of Red Grant.A first for a Bond film is that this one also has it's share of minor sub-plots, which could be interesting in a television show, but here detracts from the main story line of finding the ATAC. These include a romance with under-aged Bibi Dahl that doesn't work at all, the Schlaf affair, and even the raid on Kristatos' warehouse. What's interesting, though, is that most of these elements where lifted word for word from Ian Fleming's short stories, Risico and, appropriately, For Your Eyes Only, so it's hardly a surprise that they don't connect directly and the writers should be commended for bringing these elements into play at all.I also love how the Columbo-Kristatos feud and Melina's revenge plot fits into the story, and with all this going on, it's amazing how they fit it all into little over than two hours! On top of all this, the almost gadget free nature of the film makes Bond have to use his wits, so that why he didn't just jet-pack his way up the mountain; he has to climb it. Finally, the world isn't at risk, which has Bond free to go around Europe in a much more interesting treasure hunt.But, like any Bond film, For Your Eyes Only isn't without it's faults. The musical score by Bill Conti is a unique departure from the norm, but is sometimes too loud and seems to be stuck in the '70's. The two bookends of the film, the beginning and end, are in no way related to the rest of the story and just scream tacked-on. They are just too ridiculous to fit in with the rest of the fairly serious tone.So, while The Spy Who Loved Me is Moore's best and most entertaining venture into the world of Bond, FYEO does a great job at doing something different, and with it's blend of exciting action sequences, good locales, intrigue, and an involving story that keeps the viewer interested, this is my 6th favorite 007 adventure and I recommend it to anyone. 8.5/10 "}{"Title":"Bond, Back to Basics, Part II...","Date":"7 April 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  If the failure of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN resulted in producer Albert Broccoli's returning to an earlier, THUNDERBALL/YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE approach to 007 film making, the disastrous reviews of MOONRAKER had the producer looking back even further...to the grittier, low-tech world of Ian Fleming, in fact.The film, combining elements of several Bond short stories (as well as the climactic Live and Let Die 'shark dragging' sequence) would introduce a tougher, more physically active Roger Moore, in the kind of 'rough and tumble' performance everyone assumed only Sean Connery could pull off. And no one was less pleased by the move than 53-year old Moore, who preferred his Bond to be light and comic (a la Cary Grant), and NOT banged up and bloody! Moore announced his retirement, and it took a hefty pay raise to lure him back.The first directorial outing for long-time editor/second unit boss, John Glen, the film's pre-title sequence would be an in-house joke directed at writer/producer Kevin McClory, who had struggled against MGM/UA for several years in an attempt to make his own Bond movie. The final resolution restricted him to remaking THUNDERBALL (which he had co-written with Ian Fleming and Jack Whittingham), and utilizing characters of that film. Broccoli, not wanting McClory to use 'Ernst Blofeld', who had appeared in THUNDERBALL, as leverage for a share of the profits, dropped any reference to the character after DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Now, after ten years, Broccoli decided to 'reintroduce' a bald, villainous man in a Nehru jacket, holding a cat, but NEVER to refer to him by name, thus preventing McClory from taking action. After Bond visits his wife, Tracy's grave (only the second time the bride, murdered by Blofeld in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, had been referred to), the agent is trapped in a helicopter remotely-controlled by the 'Blofeld' look-alike. Eventually, Bond gets the upper hand, and drops the wheelchair-bound villain down a chimney to his death. Take THAT, McClory!The film, involving the recovery of a lost British decoding device, would involve rival Greek 'mobs' (headed by Julian Glover and Topol), WWII-based blood feuds, an English/Greek girl (French beauty Carole Bouquet) on a quest for vengeance for her parents' murder, and a young ice skater (Lynn-Holly Johnson) with a crush on the 'much older' Bond. (While much was made of Bond gallantly saying 'No' to her youthful advances...a first for the libido-driven 007...Bouquet, who Bond DOES sleep with, was, in fact, only a year older than Johnson!) For Roger Moore, who would suffer through over-zealous fistfights, near-drowning, car wrecks, and a dangerous mountain climb, the film would result in more injuries than he'd ever sustained playing 007, but would garner him his best reviews as the secret agent, ever.And, to top things of, an event unseen by the camera would become the stuff of legend. While filming an early scene between Bond and Countess Lisl von Schlaf (lovely Cassandra Harris), her 29-year old actor husband visited the set, and met Moore and Broccoli. The producer, impressed by the actor's poise and good looks, remarked that he might make a good James Bond, someday.Thus was Pierce Brosnan introduced to the world of 007!With FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, a new, tough James Bond would emerge, to the delight of Bond purists, everywhere...but the actor who truly 'defined' a tough Bond was about to re-emerge, after a 12-year absence. Roger Moore would soon be competing against his illustrious predecessor, Sean Connery...

The slap in the face to Kevin McClory in the beginning with the Blofeld scene was great. I wish they would just sell the rights to SPECTRE so they could use Blofeld and SPECTRE in BOND 21.Positives (1) Great combination of villian and henchman (Kristatos and Locque.) The fact that it isn't revealed that Kristatos is the real bad guy until halfway through the film is cool because at first he doesn't really possess any evil qualities. Locque is one of the best henchmen in the series. (2) Great women. Melina is definitely my favorite Bond girl, next to Jinx in DIE ANOTHER DAY. Two women that kick tail first and ask questions later. Plus Bibi is pretty nice to look at even though she is a bit of a brat in the movie. (3) THE TITLE SONG IS SPECTACULAR! I have always loved the song, even as a kid. The first Bond movie I saw was DIE ANOTHER DAY, which turned me on to the rest of the series. The first movie I watched was FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, surprisingly because I love the song so much. Sheena Easton really drives it home. Great opening sequence as well. (4) A good blend of action. From the skiing sequences from the sequence where Bond first meets Melina to the underwater scenes in the sunken ship, the action is great. (5) The whole revenge angle. I love this angle in the Bond Movies. Maybe that's why the majority of my favorite Bond movies (FYEO, DAD and DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER) all deal with revenge as one of the main themes.Negatives There is nothing I disliked about this movie. It was the best in the Bond series.

Some of the fun of watching the Bond films comes from the fantasy of it all. Plus, Moonraker was actually pretty good. However, the elements of a realistic spy thriller really made From Russia With Love a fantastic movie, and it does the same for this one. The unforgettable opening intro really sets the pace for the whole film, and is followed by a fantastic theme song. Sheena Easton's song ranks third on the theme song list and is surprassed only by A View To A Kill and License To Kill. Bill Conti, who did the music for Rocky, put together an unforgettable score that ranks with the ones from Goldeneye, Thunderball, The Spy Who Loved Me, Goldfinger, and OHMSS. In this adventure, Bond is sent to find out about the sinking of the St. Georges, which carried the ATAC device (Some sort of thing that sinks ships or something. I don't know.). The plot develops a solid mystery, with Bond facing memorable enemies and killers like Emile Locque (Michael Gothard) and Eric Kriegler (John Wyman). Melina Havelock (Carole Bouqet) was an awesome Bond woman, and I loved the way she had a crossbow and defended herself rather than scream for help or get captured. There are also great supporting characters like Milos Columbo (Topol), and a nice tribute is payed to Bernard Lee, who passed away before the film was made, by putting Bill Tanner in instead of M (I do have to admit that was a pretty ugly Bill Tanner though). All of the climaxes are great, but I think they could have done a better job on the ending. It was still good, but there really should have been some big battle in the monastery. But at least James Bond rock climbs! This is easily one of the most thrilling James Bond movies and is probably about second or third best of the 80's Bond films (License To Kill was the best of that decade). For Your Eyes Only is one of my favorites and is way cool. My rating 4 stars out of 5.

There isno more Jaws style supervillains or hollowed out volcano lairs,only sadistic serial killers, unsophisticated cars and JamesBond's own wits (ocassionaly as deadly as Q's gadgets). The filmstarts off with James Bond (Roger Moore) visiting the grave of hisdead wife Tracy (a nod to 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service') whowas killed by presumed to be dead Bond villain Ernst StravroBlofeld (played by Telly Savalas in the movie Tracy was murderedin). As Bond flies away in a helicopter it comes under the control ofBlofeld (John Hollis) but eventually Bond leads Blofeld to his finaldemise. This serves as two things a cool Bond opening and agoodbye to the super villains and high tech gadgetry of previousBond films. This Bond film is real Bond bleeds, people die,villains murder and there are no gadgets or high tech AstonMartins. I'm not saying that I don't love the cars and gadgetry ofBond but once in a while it's nice to see a more sombre Bond.Also, Moore is more serious in his role as Bond. I don't think theBond out of 'Moonraker' would have killed a villain by kicking hiscar off a cliff. Speaking of cliffs, the climax of this movie has athrilling climb up a mountain where Bond is put in danger by ahideously sadistic villain at the top. A thrilling Bond adventurescene!

In point of fact, Moore was Ian Flemming's choice as the original Bond over Sean Connery. If Moore had been given the title role in Dr. No, it could very well be Connery's quips we're complaining about now. I think if he had been in the films Connery was, he would have done just as good a job. However, being first has its advantages, and Connery gets that well deserved honor. It's not really Moore's fault that he became Bond in the 70's, not a decade known for its taste. High camp films ruled back then, witness Moonraker, one of the worst films as an example. Thankfully, Moore turns in one of the best Bond films in the entire 19 (and soon to be 20) film history of the franchise. It's down to Earth, a fantastic change from Moonraker. The villains and sidekicks are believable and downright menacing without being camp at all. Moore is getting a little old for the role by this time, but he still manages to turn in a grittier, realistic Bond that would kick Connery's butt in Diamonds Are Forever. As far as Bond movies go, especially Moore era films but just in general, this is one of the best. Just try and close your ears when you hear the horrible disco oriented music in some scenes.

It is a tight, well-plotted thriller with good performances and some terrific action. In my opinion, the best action sequences in the Bond films are the speedboat chase in Live and Let Die, the oil tanker pursuit in Licence to Kill and most exciting of all, the ski chase in this absolute peach of a film that is a definite improvement over Moonraker, and is clearly the finest Roger Moore 007 film.A good villain, an above-average Bond girl and an evidently edgier tone are some of the reasons why FYEO is an overlooked peach. The disco-themed soundtrack is amusingly silly, but as unintentionally funny as it is, the film would have been even better if John Barry had been there to do the score, and would have added even more to the tension, of which there is a lot. What makes this a real cut above most 007 films is the excellent finale, which disposes of the usual apocalyptic situations and goes for understated thrills. The sequence when Bond scales the cliff is first-rate. Moore's trademark silliness is mostly absent here, though it came back with a vengeance in the guilty pleasure masterwork that is Octopussy. Here, Moore really looks like he means it, and FYEO does have what is his finest moment when the henchman pleads for his life in the car about to go over the edge of the cliff. Moore complies by booting the car away. Great stuff. Forget Goldfinger (which is amazingly overrated). This is what Bond films are made of.

From tragically crap to cheesy fun to strong and exciting to (ignoring Moonraker) to this, Moore's reign has been a continual series of one-up-manship.This story is fun, funny, yet grounded in reality.  There's plenty of moments for Bond to perform improbable escapes and heroic bends of physical possibility, but nothing too egregious. This movie, to me, does the best job of making Bon fantastical yet holding onto that core grain of believability that is so crucial to crafting a compelling character.I spotted just two flaws in the film.  The villain, Kristatos (wonderfully portrayed by Julian Glower... try to spot him in The Empire Strikes Back) is terribly undermotivated.  The presence of the ice skating girl is totally irrelevant to the plot.  She should not have been in this movie, and she also happens to be a terrible and annoying character.The strengths are numerous.  It is so refreshing to NOT know the identity of the villain right from the beginning.  Even better, to be introduced to the villain in such a casual, off-hand manner, is a wonderful touch. Throughout the history of the Bond film, there has been a tragic lack of plot twists, misdirections, or surprises.  More of this, please, and be quick about it.Roger Moore is superb in this film, undoubtedly his best performance as Bond.  He's toned down the stupid quips quite a lot, he's a bit more ruthless, a bit more dangerous, and a bit more human.

Possibly the most serious Bond film that Roger Moore was part of, For Your Eyes Only represents one of a small number of Bond films that is not an embarrassing showcase for Moore.Yes it still has problems. There are far too many Bond girls. It therefore is difficult to get a grounding on any of their personalities. The villain when he is revealed is cheap and unmemorable. There is not a single characteristic I can recall about him and I only just watched the film.With regards to Bond girls they do not come as vengeful and driven as Melina Havelock. Carole Bouquet enthuses her character with confidence, without question she is the greatest Bond girl of the 80s and the most independent.Yes, For Your Eyes Only is a fairly standard Bond film. But much better that than following in the footsteps of Moore's string of duds like The Man with the Golden Gun, Moonraker and Octopussy. It is entertaining yet other Bond films feel daring and dramatic, qualities that For Your Eyes Only is sorely lacking. Still this was a sensible decision as Moonraker had driven Bond off course, so he had to find his natural footing once again.Columbo serves Bond well as his ally. Normally they remain forgotten but Columbo actually has a purpose and does not feel redundant or wasted. The music is quirky and you can tell that this is not John Barry's score. Yet the synth score is still a pleasing listen.For Your Eyes Only is a sober Bond outing; stripped of all glamour and chutzpah, more in the vein of Dr No than Moonraker. It does not take many risks, but after all maybe that was wise. Bond for a time was starting to get his sophistication back.

But I found For Your Eyes Only to break that streak of tongue and cheek Bond films to virtually follow the same old story to get where they wanted to go. There are still quite a few tongue and cheek moments, especially with the out of place Bibi character, but I think the stakes are higher as are the quality of the action sequences. It's not my favorite of the bunch either, but I found it to be a nice change up for the franchise.I think by far the best asset this film has is its unpredictability. It had a knack for keeping characters around just enough for us to care and short enough to where we don't grow tired of them. Which is why when some of them die, you feel the weight of their death. On the other hand, sometimes the story itself becomes full of itself. The villains and there motivations become convoluted and discombobulated. It may be the first complex Bond film of the series. But people aren't watching for the complex plot and characters, they want to see Bond in action. The action is great although I think they once again rehashed chase scenes and settings. I don't know what it is about this series, but they love filming underwater action, and ski chases. We got similar chases in On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me a few years before. The underwater setting has been used just as much. As exuberant as the action and settings are, the characters are far less flashy and filled with much more mystery. The lead villains don't have an island, or an underwater city, or a secret nuclear factory, but they are just as maniacal. Speaking of maniacal, I really enjoyed the opening sequence with Bond presumably killing Blofeld once and for all. It was good to see another whole film not be centered around him.

The plot is fun and of course a little silly as we come to expect but the film is pure entertainment and can be enjoyed by anyone who wises to let it do so. With a great cameo from (HEADS UP, MAYBE A SPOILER),Blofeld among other fun things, I felt this film was strongly an OK film, and here below is why I just felt that way about this piece.Bond is fun as ever in this and even though he is ageing, he still manages some good fighting talk and uses gadgets to the best of his ability. I liked the setting for this one and the story gains from it with some beautiful things used within and things such as Bond being dragged through Coral being oddly nice to look at. The movie is a distinctly faster speed than some of Moore's previous film, or maybe that is just the great 80's score used in chase scenes among other parts also. The story brings Bond into the eighties with a bang and serves up a fun adventure with a maybe more darkish theme.Moore does what he always does, play Bond with charm, wit and humour and still manages to save the day without firing a shot, in this one Moore can sometimes seem less suave and more commando as he even climbs a rock face, and he doesn't wear a tuxedo whilst doing it. Carole Bouquet as the Bond girl is good and actually isn't one his girls who seems scared of getting into the action, she is used just as much when it comes to violence and action. I also enjoyed Bond's little group of people he uses who help him in the film and make for a film where Bond is used in a team.Script is fun and so is directing, whether or not either being fun is a good thing is up to you to decide. As I previously mentioned, the setting is wonderfully beautiful and makes for a Bond set in some exotically if not always in the same place locations. I liked the sets used which were some of the best we have seen in Bond so far, with the underwater scenes which you will see as the forefront of this films great production design which was smartly efficient.The film suffers the same fate a lot of Moore's also do, he just doesn't seem like a real special agent, and at this age you would think his bones would be taking a bit hit from all these stunts, nevertheless Moore does seem to glide through them effortlessly. Some parts are a bit slow in all honesty and can bore you if you don't pay attention because some parts are just packed with dialogues, where as some parts are overly used action so although it works out well in the end, bit's can be partly dull.All Bond film fans should enjoy this as it is Moore being his ever self and doing everything he usually does, he doesn't change much at all but it still works well. I think those who enjoy seeing Bond do a little more fighting may be slightly disappointed as it lacks in that area, but only just a little in anyway. The film is also not one to say it is solidly rational, so if you are looking for rational action and adventure, stay away from this one, and on that note, all of Roger Moore's stints.Overall I give it a 6/10, I did feel it was Strongly OK and worked well as a Bond film for me. This is the kind of Bond where you have to watch with a smile on your face and just enjoy it as a film, forget if some bits don't seem that real, just enjoy it to it's fullest, may not be near the best Bond movies either but still does a good job of entertainment.

This time, we have a believable plot, good allies, a decent villain and a Bond film that relies more on wit and ruthlessness than lasers or crazy motives. Though I don't think the overall finish is as good as The Spy who Loved Me, this is one of Moore's better outings, even if it does have a rather pointless opening sequence that could have broken the film had it not been for the plot strengthening after the credits. When a British marine archaeologist is murdered in cold blood with his wife, Bond is sent to investigate because it turns out the archaeologist was attempting to rescue a specific piece of of equipment used by NATO, that the Russians want. Bond thinks that he has found a friend in Kristatos, a Greek who knows the area and who has pledged his help, but following a running in with a smuggler, Columbo (fabulously acted by Topol), he discovers that Kristatos is the villain, and is in direct talks with the Russians to sell them the device. Bond, Topol and the daughter of the archaeologist, Melina, all go after Kristatos, leading to a thrilling finale in a monastery. This is another good turn from Moore as Bond, who once again shows us that he can act, and that he can offer some ruthlessness when he needs to. It was in many ways a shame that he didn't bow out from the franchise after this outing, as it would have been a great finale for him. Instead, he did two more films that weren't so good, and I think because he has a few weak outings, it detracts from the Bond outings that were good. He is often remembered more for the comical acts, rather than the stronger films he was associated with. For your Eyes only also benefits from a more intense, stronger Bond girl in the form of Melina, (Carole Bouquet), who wants revenge for the death of her family, and from Topol as Columbo, who is much like Kerim Bay in the film From Russia with Love. Julian Glover is also more stylish, down to earth villain who may not be as strong as previous villains, but is far more believable. This would have been worth an 8/10, except for two problems. One is the appalling soundtrack, and the other is that at times, the plot is too much like previous Bonds, and doesn't really add anything to the franchise. So, for that, I think 7/10 is more appropriate.

This is no grandiose story about megalomaniacs out to launch nuclear or biological holocausts, or drug lord heads of state. This is a tale of revenge and a search for vital technology, the stuff of real spies.The film takes its plot from two Fleming short stories, For Your Eyes Only and Risico. The former is a tale of a young woman's attempt at revenge, which leads her to cross paths with Bond. The later is a tale of smugglers and double-crosses. Both mesh extremely well and give us a Bond story that is more down-to-earth than our last outing, literally! The comedy is kept to a relative minimum and the danger is upped.The cast is mostly good. Julian Glover and Topol are welcome additions, elevating the acting level from recent outings. Carole Bouquet is serviceable, with beautiful haunting eyes. She is just believable enough as the vengeance seeking woman. The one character that doesn't work is Bibi. She just serves to illustrate how old Roger Moore is getting and turns her scenes into a sad Lolita wannabe.The stunts never get too outlandish, helping to maintain the sense of realism. They are also in service to the plot, not just inserted into the script.Thankfully, comedy is mostly kept to the Q briefing, which has become a staple of things under Moore (even more than they did in the later Connery films). Unfortunately, one bit of comedy undermines what should have been a deadlier moment. In the teaser, we are led to believe that Bond is being attacked by Bloefeld, on the anniversary of Tracy's death (we can assume that is why Bond is visiting her grave). I say led to believe because EON couldn't legally use Bloefeld anymore. Still, the bald head, injured body, menacing voice, and Tracy's grave all scream Bloefeld. So, in what appears to be the final confrontation, Bond is making jokes, and bad ones at that. This is the man who killed his one true love and he is cracking corny jokes? Nope, not buying that. Thankfully, the rest of the film is removed from that.So, we finally get a mostly serious Roger Moore Bond and it works! It has great stunts, but they serve a purpose. It has a fine cast of actors, with one or two exceptions. It has a mystery to keep the plot moving and the unique feature of the singer of the theme song appearing in the title sequence (a song which won an Oscar).

From an interesting Bond girl, another great title song, and some nice action scenes, it's kind of like a lesser The Spy Who Loved Me, but that was one of the best. One of the only complaints I have is that Moore is just too old to play Bond anymore. As some have obviously seen, he looks like a creepy uncle sometimes when he is with these girls, and that comes off as a little disturbing. The villain is standard, but does his job well enough for me not to dislike him as a villain, and the Bond girl has a little twist you usually don't get. And as mentioned, the action scenes are still good. The best of which is an extended ski chase and again at the end with Bond climbing the rock, a nice thrill ride from start to finish.

Its greatest downside, however, has to be Bond's acquirement of philosophical chic (due to his advanced years, presumably).

Things get off to a great start with the teaser, although it is probably the most outrageous part of the film it still works tremendously well, as Bond encounters Blofeld again and we see him visiting his deceased wife's grave (anything which recognizes On Her Majesty's Secret Service is good). It is in many ways the sequence which should have opened Diamonds are Forever. I find it plays much better following On Her Majesty's Secret Service than that film does.Although he's looking a bit old for the part by this film, this is easily Moore's best outing as Bond. He shows an edge and physicality that is missing from most of the films in his era, and surprises me every time as I have a habit of generalizing and forgetting this film when I criticize his portrayal of Bond and/or the writing for the character during his era. For Your Eyes Only is refreshingly uninterested in gadgetry and silliness, focusing on well-orchestrated chases and fistfights, which provide easily the best action scenes of the Moore era. John Glen's debut as director displays confidence and talent, and a good eye for composition and visual narrative. He would become lazy on some later films, but when he's on form he's one of the best directors to work on the Bond films. This script is really refreshing after the constant attack of ultra-juvenile and embarrassing sex jokes (even by Bond standards) and silliness that was Moonraker. The comic relief here works quite well other than the annoying Bibi played by Lynn-Holly Johnson, and the parrot at the end of the movie, and the film's plot is not bad given how it serves as little more than a loose framework for the spectacular action scenes. I rather like the Bill Conti score, as well, although I recognize that I am in a minority there.For Your Eyes Only is the best Roger Moore Bond film, and features Moore's best performance as Bond. A well-directed, slightly flawed but still completely worthwhile entry in the series, and at the time of its release the best Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.8/10 "},{"Title":"But you won't need to read between the lines","Date":"26 July 2006","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how FOR YOUR EYES ONLY rates on a scale of 1 to 10 Title FOR YOUR EYES ONLY It takes a directive ordering top secrecy and turns it into a promise of sexual intimacy. Two of James Bond's favorite pastimes rolled into one. 8 points.Pre-Credit Teaser In an attempt to get rid of archenemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld once and for all for legal reasons (and possibly taking a shot at the probable resurrection of the character for the upcoming maverick Bond film, NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN), the film opens with an elaborate stunt sequence that builds up to the character's unceremonious demise. It's a series of stunts involving a remote control helicopter, with James as the sole passenger; it's all nicely done, to be sure, but considering the sequence goes out of its way to remind us that Blofeld murdered Bond's wife, it is surprisingly lacking in drama. Indeed, it's played for laughs. Very curious. 7 points.Opening Credits With Maurice Binder's graphic magic doing double duty as both opening credits and a MTV-style video, Sheena Easton ends up being a Bond Girl once removed. Having her appear behind the titles as she sings the theme song might have been crassly intended to sell the song to the pop charts, but actually it does add another layer to the visuals. And Binder's video art gains greater depth and dimension. 8 points.Theme Song Easton jump started her pop popularity with this warm and sexy ballad of romantic surrender. Michael Leeson's clever lyrics took an awkwardly worded phrase and managed to make it work. Sadly this might prove to be the last of the great Bond theme songs. 8 points.Bond, James Bond Roger Moore is more the merrier and seems to be enjoying himself a great deal in what was allegedly his favorite Bond romp. He's not so much at the mercy of the gadgets and gimmicks and you get the feeling that Bond is a good agent and not some superhero. 8 points.Bond Babes The film's sacrificial lamb is a counterfeit countess, Lisl von Schaf (Cassandra Harris, a.k.a., Mrs. Pierce Brosnan), who barely rolls out of Bond's bed before getting snuffed. It's a pity. But Carole Bouquet is a strong presence as Bond Girl No. 1, playing a daughter out to avenge her parents' murder and there is the definite feeling she might succeed even without Bond's meddling. I'm not sure what to make of Lynn-Holly Johnson as a teenage Olympic skating hopeful who has a strange crush on a surprisingly paternal Bond; it's funny, but a tad creepy. 8 points.Bond Villain After going to extremes to kill off Blofeld as a throwaway joke at the beginning, it is remarkable that no effort was made to give EYES even a vaguely interesting villain. Playing games about who the real bad guy is has a minor interest, but it hardly matters whether it is a the mildly amusing Topol or the totally banal Julian Glover. With no strong central villain, the film lacks focus, though it does gain an element of mystery. 3 points.Bond Baddies A Cuban assassin, a French assassin and an East German assassin -- and all three of them together could not add up to an Oddjob, a Jaws or even a Nick Nack. They are even duller that the main villain. 2 points.Sinister Plot With no sinister plot to take control of the world or to start World War III, the plot seems positively lightweight. The whole focus of the film is the search for a decoding device on a ship that sunk off the coast of Greece. Exactly why the secret service just doesn't go and get the device, rather than playing cat and mouse with the bad guys, is a total mystery. As McGuffins go, it is okay, I suppose; but it hardly seems worth all the hullabaloo. 5 points.Production values Were the expectations over it being a Bond film not so high, EYES might actually seem so much better. By Bond standards, the film could be deemed low key, or else it could be seen as simply being more about character than plot. Whatever the case, it is certainly so smoothly done it doesn't seem so obvious that it is being done by the numbers. 7 points.Bonus Points The decision to go relatively low-tech in this adventure is best exemplified by the decision to blow up Bond's Lotus and replace it in the big chase by a Citroën 2CV 6 Club, an adorable little yellow crackerbox on wheels. The message seems to be that it's not the wheels but the guy behind the wheel that matters and certainly they take the opportunity to rev up the standard chase sequence with a great deal of automotive humor. 10 points.Summary An abrupt, yet welcome, withdraw from the escalating bigger and bolder escapades of the Bond adventures of the 1970s, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY represents at least a momentary retreat to the Bond of the early 1960s. The film has so much going for it, yet falls just shy of being one of the all-time great 007 adventures because it lacks both a compelling story and, worse, a memorable nemesis for Bond to battle.Bond-o-meter Rating 74 points out of 100.

It came as a welcome breath of air after the silliness of Moonraker and was obviously an attempt by the film makers to return Bond to a more realistic setting and plot. The film captures the spirit of the early Bond films much more than any of the other Roger Moore films and is all the better for it. He plays the part with more sincerity this time and there is less wisecracking and less reliance on ridiculous gadgets, requiring the character to survive more with his wits, as in the earlier Bond films. Carole Bouquet provides the eye candy and I think she was rather attractive and fitted the part very well. Julian Glover's villain is rather bland, though and he lacks menace, so he is not a particularly memorable Bond villain. Topol, from Fiddler On The Roof, also makes an amusing appearance later in the film and becomes Bond's friend and ally. There is a downside to the film, though. It features some of the most awful music that I have ever heard in a Bond film and this ruins several scenes. I later learned that it was written by Bill Conti, who also did Rocky, but it is totally inappropriate and out of place for a film such as this. It made me yearn even more for the lush soundtracks of John Barry, who was absent here, but would return for Octopussy. The ending is also rather silly and doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the film. It features Janet Brown as the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, it is totally unnecessary and makes the film look dated. However, this is still a superb Bond film, one of the very best, despite the awful soundtrack and ending, though I did like the title song by Sheena Easton. It is a pity that it went downhill a bit with Octopussy, but it should be judged on its own terms. Roger Moore would never make another Bond film as good as this. An excellent film.

Despite great box office returns, and growing popularity, they had almost fallen completely away from the original concept of 007. Connery's last film was disappointing, bringing in campy humor that would follow through the decade. Roger Moore's first two Bond movies seemed experimental, using humor and comic type scenes to capture entertainment. They hit the nail on the head with The spy who loved me, however was they hit the Hollywood space race with moonraker, which was completely out of line of a spy flick, using much humor, comic type henchmen, over the top plan, and stereotypical bad guy.Finally, they took the franchise back to earth, with For Your Eyes Only, a no nonsense type movie. This one did not use any stupid cliché's seen in earlier movies, instead uses a believable storyline to capture the entertainment.In this movie, Bond is sent to find a missing ATAC system that sunk aboard a British ship. He gets the help from Miss Havalock, who's parents were murdered by a hit-man. Bond is to try to find who he was working for, leading to Kristatoes, who informed him that Columbo, a Greek smuggler, was the true man behind it. Bond soon learns Kristatoes is the smuggler, trying to get 007 to assassinate Columbo. He then gets the help from the Bond girl and Columbo to recover the ATAC.What is best about this movie is how refreshing it is. The soundtrack, the overall fell of the movie is just great. I like how it deals with a more espionage type story, instead of another re-hashed, cartoon like storyline that we have seen many times before.

One of the ones I caught that I hadn't seen in a while was For Your Eyes Only. I fell asleep during one of the ski scenes. While watching it I had a thought. Roger Moore played the role of James Bond the Longest--well I guess he's technically tied with Connery because Connery did the unofficial one in 1983, but still the guy did a lot of Bond movies. A couple of questions came to mind--how was Moore able to make so many and how did James Bond survive the 1970's and early to mid 1980's? From Connery's last awful Diamonds Are Forever to Moonraker finishing Moore's career in the mid '80's with A View To a Kill. For Your Eyes Only probably represents the best of Moore's 1980's films. Dang though he was old by this time. It's one thing to have an old Indiana Jones or Han Solo, but James Bond was never meant to be an old timer and even if Moore was in pretty good shape he was still old. They should have changed him out at that time with Timothy Dalton. Moore's Bond movies were two cheesy and again his age got in the way. The best of his films were probably The Spy Who Loved Me and Live and Let Die was okay. Also, too many of his movies had ski chase scenes on the snow and For Your Eyes Only probably represented the longest ski chase scene and it was pretty boring. Moore should have never been selected anyway based on age. He was in his mid 40's by the time he did his first Bond movie. All other actors who have played Bond were younger. Well, despite the Moore years, James Bond survived. Looks like someone may be taking over for Daniel Craig now.

It's not a memorable Bond film but it gets the job done. The story is really repetitious and just really seemed to drag on. Sure the formula of Bond digging for clues and the bad guys constantly after Bond's life has been done many times and over. But it's just so darn noticeable here, it's like they just didn't have enough story so they focused on a lot of scene with the bad guys trying to kill James Bond.

Bond certainly gets around - he journeys from the swathing heats of southern Europe to the icy, hostility ridden locale of The Alps whilst in search of something of great value, but that sense of travel or scope or something at stake is always undercut by the fact out-and-out narrative is sparse and familiar codes are being repeated. The best of what Moore led during his Bond tenure remains The Spy Who Loved Me, a film in which you genuinely felt a craft was at work as director Lewis Gilbert took us through this investigative thriller built on what audiences knew, but provided us with lots to get involved in. Less so here, but that said, the film just about holds water as a stone-wall action piece with various other items gently propping it up and keeping it the tame success story it is. It is, mercifully, a far cry from the cash-in entry that was Moonraker; here being a Bond film in which The Cold War and spy thriller causality drives proceedings &#x96; far removed from characters pointing out whom the villain was in the opening scenes and standardised formulae given a space-age polish because it means the pockets of those in the upper echelons of a company may be filled.That sense of everything being re-grounded, or being placed back to Earth (in both a literal and metaphorical capacity) is apparent with an opening scene in which we witness Roger Moore's recurrent lead James Bond at a graveyard beside that of his deceased wife's tombstone. He places flowers and there is a pause for thought, the lone woman in his life up to this point whom meant more to him than any other gone for good. The opening cemetery scene sets a neat behavioural trend in regards to women for the rest of the film, something which eventually comes to see the man refuse the advances of a promiscuous (later revealed as surplus) young American ice-skater as well as dismiss varying opportunities to take advantage of another female character at a delicate, vulnerable time in her life when grief is her chief residing emotion. Like him, she has lost ones whom meant a great deal with them.The standardised introduction of Bond as this invincible, all conquering hero able to turn any situation unfolds following a fun, albeit with some misplaced anthropomorphism on account of a fluffy white cat, skirmish with long-time villain of the Connery movies Blofeld. Moore, barely beyond half way through his premiership in the role, looks the part. As one IMDb user puts it on the forums (he looks like a) nicely weathered pulp hero whom appears as somebody with some miles on (him). The film begins in earnest with a composition of a man looking sorely out of place whilst on board a Maltese fishing boat; sure enough, he goes back below deck and it is revealed the thing is a British intelligence vessel - the standard rule of thumb that any Bond film of this era beginning on a British ship/submarine/plane is destined for some sort of doom gracefully adhered to when a mine is caught in the nets and sinks both it as well as a device on board, named the ATAC and capable of positioning nuclear submarines, to the bottom of the Ionian Sea.Enter Melina (Bouquet), a woman bilingual in her native Greek as well as English whose parents are ruthlessly gunned down before her whilst working out there to retrieve the aforementioned device. Seething, she seeks revenge, and it is only a matter of time before both her and Bond's paths cross as he hunts the device she was closer to than she first envisaged. Where it is business to Bond, it is personal to her. Unfortunately, we don't feel Melina's revenge strand as the tragic, poetically inclined plot line existing to neatly undercut proceedings that it might have been, in fact for large parts of the film we forget about it. Instead, she pops up now and again to dispatch some henchmen, but mostly treads through proceedings wearing tight swimsuits and pretty outfits whilst acting as a supporting ally to an increasingly larger band of men, whose own agendas and plot lines gradually come to dominate proceedings more and more.Bond and Melena's hunt leads them to the Italian Alps, during which Bond falls foul of a handful of certain winter Olympic disciplines in an annoyingly episodic manner; if an unneeded encounter with some thuggish ice hockey players wasn't enough, then the bobsleigh run from Hell probably will be. Segments closer to the area in which the MacGuffin sunk provide us with a decent claustrophobic underwater skirmish following twists to do with who's trustworthy and who's not whilst back up on land. These segments are good value, with that sense of it being Bond and his allies versus circles of villainy plus these sociopaths out to thwart them prominent and making for good enough viewing. Everything is punctuated by that of Bill Conti's oft-decent score, although at the worst of times it does veer off and away into what sounds like a poor man's Bond '77. The best of what Conti does arrives in the form of a piece managing to get across the sheer scale of a towering ski-jump structure as we look at it from the ground up, a dizzying array of manic piano keys reminding us of a skier's starting cue working to good effect. We enjoy enough of For Your Eyes Only; it is by no means bad and its back-to-basics feel rife throughout keeps the overcooked sense of adventure evident throughout Moonraker at bay, while director John Glen, helming his first of five entries, maintains a burning and consistent tone in what is, overall, a worthy effort.

It goes bad right from the opening of Bond in the eye. Roger Moore appears in flares, to the twangy overtures of Bill Conti's extremely bad score. Unfortunately he decided to re-mix the classic Bond theme in the style of 1970s disco music. Perhaps a good idea at the time, but having just heard David Arnold's, terrific score to Tomorrow Never Dies, this is really hard on the ears. In fact every single potentially suspenseful action sequence is ruined by the incongruous sounds of the instruments used. At points it seems, he just chose to hit the piano and hope. It shows, especially when the best sequence of the film, Bond scaling a sheer cliff face, is played out in silence. The music aside, there is the unnecessary return of Blofeld, at the start, who has the worst concocted plan ever in a Bond film, to kill 007, and a closing comic scene featuring bad impersonators of Maggie and Dennis Thatcher, which made me curl my toes over 360 degrees. Let's also not forget the fact that the main villain is quite unmemorable, and the fact that Moore could never beat the life out of a fly.

I distinctly saw the 2CV fall into a massive black catch-net. All in all just another in a much-loved film series which was already in decline due to an emphasis on mirth (questionable) over real spy-genre values. The one-liners continue to be pretty awful generally and rather silly. The music score, as with so many films in the 1980s, was very average. Class stands the test of time. This version and others either side of it fall some way short. But I will always be a fan of James Bond and they appear to have gone back to its roots latterly and much better for it.

After 'Moonraker' there really wasn't anywhere else for the Bonds to go in terms of the wit and spectacle that Roger Moore specialised in, you were never going to top 'The Spy Who Loves Me' and 'Moonraker' with hijacked nuclear submarines and laser battles in space. So instead we have a much more back to basics Bond, announced very succinctly when the Lotus from 'The Spy Who Loves Me' gets blown sky high and Bond casually just tosses the keys away (a shame as it would surely have come in useful if it still turned into a submarine). Instead we have the slightly incongruous sight of James Bond fleeing the bad guys in a Citreon 2CV? This time Q-branch won't be there to come to his rescue.One of the most realistic Bond plots ever, the loss of a British spy ship and its' Enigma style decoding device off Albania is a headline that could be ripped from a Cold War newspaper. The background story of two friends, comrades in the Greek resistance against the Nazis who are now committed enemies on opposite sides of the East/West conflict could have been truly great especially considering the high quality actors portraying them. That Bond originally takes one to be his ally only to discover that actually he's backed the wrong horse is an interesting touch, we don't normally see him make such misjudgements, the villain is usually much more obvious and not one who has been previously decorated by her Majesty's government. Beautiful Bond girl with some real motivations, some great underwater sequences, especially with the extremely scary ultra-deep diving suit and as always we can rely on Roger to bring the humour, especially the opening sequence, byebye Blofeld and it's nice that we see Bond visit his wife's grave (you wonder will Tracy ever feature in Daniel Craig's Bond films?). Plus did you spot Charles Dance as henchman?But somehow it just doesn't all hang together, the Austrian scenes go on far too long. We have Bond demonstrate his steel by kicking the main henchman over the cliff in his car (great scene, apparently Roger was reluctant to do it as he felt it wasn't the thing for his version of Bond but he pulls it off with elan). Yet then he tries to warn off the Bond girl from avenging her parents, after he avenges his wife in the first scene? The subplot with the gymnast is awful and the climax not up to much. We don't need the scenes on the beach and why couldn't he have got the Bond girl to work on salvaging the ship whilst he tried to track down the hit-man?So it could have been great but just needed to have been leaner "},{"Title":"With a stronger villain this would have been the best Moore Bond","Date":"11 October 2013","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" When I reviewed the Daniel Craig Casino Royale I described it as Bond rethought for the twenty-first century, although this was not the only occasion on which the series was rethought. Some degree of rethinking has been necessary every time a new actor has taken over the lead role, especially when Pierce Brosnan took over in 1995 after a six-year hiatus. This film however, represents a serious reappraisal of the James Bond series halfway through one actor's tenure.The previous Bond film, Moonraker, was not a complete failure; it had, for example, two very good villains in Michael Lonsdale's Drax and Richard Kiel's Jaws. It was, however, the target of considerable criticism, mostly concentrating on the fanciful, over-the-top plot, often closer to science fiction than to a standard spy film, on an excessive reliance on technological gadgets and on Roger Moore's laid back and overly relaxed style of acting. The heroine, Lois Chiles's Holly Goodhead, was also one of the weaker Bond girls. For Your Eyes Only, can be seen as (to adapt Shostakovich's sub-title for this Fifth Symphony) A British Secret Agent's Reply to Just Criticism. It has a more realistic, espionage-based plot with less reliance on gadgets. It involves that old Bond standby, a car chase, but here James Bond is not driving a top-of-the-range sports car packed with Q's latest inventions but a Citroen 2CV (aka Tin Snail), about the least sophisticated car still on the market in 1981. Carole Bouquet, as the main female character Melina Havelock, is the first really satisfactory main Bond Girl since Jane Seymour in Live and Let Die. Barbara Bach in The Spy Who Loved Me was even more wooden than Chiles, which was a pity as her character Anya Amasova was a potentially interesting one. In The Man with the Golden Gun the problem is not so much Britt Ekland's acting as the way her character Mary Goodnight is written as an inept if endearing bimbo. Bouquet- another slim, long-haired brunette with finely chiselled features, bears a certain physical resemblance to Seymour, and the characters they play are both unusually complex for Bond Girls, although in different ways. Seymour's Solitaire is passive and fatalistic, whereas Melina is much more active, obsessed with avenging her parents who were murdered by the villains. The plot is relatively straightforward. Out go all those mad tycoons plotting to achieve world domination. A British spy ship is sunk off the coast of Greece. On board is a revolutionary new communications system of crucial importance in the Cold War. Can Bond and his allies (foremost among them the lovely Melina) retrieve this McGuffin before the bad guys, who are working for the Russians, get their hands on it? Moore's performance here is grittier and more focused than it had been in Moonraker and he puts more of himself into the role. The producers may also have wanted to make Bond less casually promiscuous than he had been in some episodes. Although there is a brief love scene between him and Melina, this is one film where he actually turns down a sexual invitation from an attractive young woman, the nymphomaniac figure skater Bibi Dahl. Besides Bond, Bibi also has her eyes upon East German athlete Erich Kriegler, not knowing that he is working for the villains, and in her very close relationship with her female coach there is a hint (although no more than that) that she may be bisexual. Bibi is played by Lynn-Holly Johnson, a real-life ice skater before she turned to acting, and given the talent she shows here, her good looks and her bubbly personality I am always surprised that Lynn-Holly did not have a longer acting career. The film opens with a brief pre-credits sequence in which Bond is seen disposing of an adversary by dropping him down a factory chimney from a helicopter. Although this has no direct link with the main action it does prefigure the narrative theme of revenge. It is strongly implied, although never (apparently for legal reasons) directly stated, that this enemy is Blofeld and that his death represents Bond's revenge for the death of his wife Tracy, a tale told in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. One character missing from this film is the MI6 boss M. Bernard Lee, who had played the role in all previous Bond movies was due to play it again here, but died shortly before filming began and, out of respect for his memory, the producers decided to write M out of the script. The film's main weakness is that it does not contain a memorable villain comparable to the likes of Dr No, Goldfinger, Blofeld, Scaramanga or Drax. Bond's enemies here are a motley collection of international gangsters none of whom really fits the bill; the Cuban hit-man Gonzales dies too early on, the Belgian criminal Emile Locque is too anonymous and the corrupt Greek businessman Kristatos insufficiently menacing. Topol, as Kristatos' rival Columbo, might have made a decent baddie, but he turns out to be Bond's ally and one of the good guys. This was John Glen's first film as director. He was to direct four more Bond films, but this remains his best. For Your Eyes Only, in fact, has nearly everything one could look for in a Bond film- a good performance from the hero, a beautiful heroine, exciting action sequences and an excellent theme song from Sheena Easton. With a stronger villain I would have rated it the best Bond from the Moore era; as it is it comes first equal with Live and Let Die. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Where For Your Eyes Only Stands","Date":"8 August 2013","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":" Its finally a relief for a normal Bond film after the outrageous MOONRAKER (1979).

This, to be truthful wasn't the best or most exciting outing I've ever seen for 007. Roger Moore strolls amiably through the part as he invariably did, but there's no edge to his playing and now pushing 50 at the time of the film's release, he seems hardly the lady- killer either. Almost in deference to this he thankfully turns away a sexual proposition from a very young female ice-skater, although the not much more mature advances of Carole Bouqet he naturally fails to resist, to say nothing of a phony countess who doesn't survive long past their liaison. Moore, not unnaturally, is looking decidedly creaky at times and no amount of long shot doubling or editing can hide it. Charm can only take you so far and there's no way you can imagine this Bond as a, forgive the hyperbole, killing sex-machine. His protagonists here are shadowy and indistinctive - that's once he's dispatched Blofeld in a prologue held over some 12 years after the conclusion to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in fact one of his nemeses looks like John Denver and the singer Topol hardly seems the right choice for James' right hand man here. The stunts are telegraphed in from earlier Bond films too, in cars, underwater, on snow and on the side of a hill. There are some exciting moments but as I said earlier they seem second-hand and don't seem credible for this ageing 007. I could have done without Bill Conti's MOR / disco take on the soundtrack, although the title song is pleasant enough if over sung by Bellshill's own Sheena Easton. I didn't dislike this Bond film, but did feel it lacked, for want of a better word, 00mph.

While it never reaches the heights of earlier Moore outings, it does provide a fair few moments of fun along the way, even if most of those are layered in distinctly '80s-era cheese. From the outlandish pre-credits sequence, in which our hero dispatches a Blofeld-esque villain down a chimney, you get the idea that this is going to be a fun, non-serious comedy-adventure movie and that's exactly what it is.The plot is undistinguished. It's about the loss of a piece of important technology, and Bond's efforts to retrieve it before the villains do. There's time some for some familiar ski slope action, a brief underwater interlude and various globe-trotting adventures involving car chases and battles with various hired thugs (including Charles Dance in an early turn). Things build up to an admittedly impressive set-piece at the climax.M doesn't show his face this time around (Bernard Lee died just before production commenced), but the scenes with Desmond Llewellyn, Lois Maxwell and Geoffrey Keen are mildly amusing, even if the Bond girls are less than memorable. Still, there's a fun character role for everyone's favourite fiddler Topol and Julian Glover plays a more understated villain than is usual for this comic book series.Altogether, I found this a laid back, fitfully amusing Bond outing, infused with Greek charm and a fun Sunday afternoon type ambiance. No classic maybe, but it could be worse. Despite the various pitfalls, this still has the feel of old school Bond, which is why I enjoyed watching it.

After a smidgen of excess in the previous space-bound outing, Moore's Bond is back but watch out, he's serious! This is something of a watershed Bond as it marks the start of John Glen's tenure as director, an era that would yield decidedly mixed results and the last official run of adventures (until 1989) before the series returned in its postmodern phase - that's a euphemism for total self-parody incidentally. FYEO is a conscious attempt to, er, ground the Bond series after Moonraker and return a slightly more straightforward, serious tone, none too watered down by puns/gadgetry and all the rest of it. The story, though it hardly matters, concerns a missing decrypton device which has probably been halfinched by the Reds. Bond is sent to recover it and bang, you have your pretext for a few car chases (one involving a Citroen 2CV no less) and a bit of ski-stuntage/sub-aquatic conflict, in other words very familiar stuff indeed.Glen and company commit some very serious cine-crimes here including the offing of Blofeld in an utterly horrendous pre-titles sequence, that's right PRE-TITLES, in which they try to state their intended shift in tone by alluding to the previously somber On Her Majesty's Secret Service and then cocking it up with the cartoon-inspired dispatch of one of the series' main villains. Next you've got an utterly saccharine theme song from mid-Atlantic twanged temptress Easton and finally a 90 minutes devoid of plot. So devoid in fact that if you sat someone down who'd never seen a Bond film and told them they were about to watch a 'best of' clips compilation and then screened FYEO, chances are they wouldn't notice the difference.I loath it because it's an utterly joyless experience with no redeemable features, a bit like that Madonna song that featured on the last one.

The opening sequence of the film, with the remote controlled helicopter and the villain in the wheelchair, is excellent, despite excessively cheesy one-liners (`I trust you had a pleasant&#133;fright?'). The theme song for the film is awful, as is almost always the case (except for The World Is Not Enough, which is one of the worst films of the series but had by far the best opening song). What you have with For Your Eyes Only is a stereotypically god-awful 80s love song, and the soundtrack of the entire film consists of this 80s crap as well. I'm not saying I don't realize this was made in the 80s, but this music is so `80s' that it's funny.(spoilers) One of the most noteworthy things about this film is that the action scenes were either very well done overall or they were incredibly realistic. For Your Eyes Only is one of the only Bond films with ski scenes that don't only avoid coming off as plainly ridiculous, but that are actually very good. There is a particularly excellent scene involving Bond on skis being pursued by a motorcyclist that has a cool climax on a luge track. There was a good scene with dune buggies, where one of the brief Bond girls in this film suffered a death that was disturbingly convincing. There is an excellent scene in which a Mercedes falls off a cliff, and as it lands on the rocks below, you can see the villain's body fall out the driver's side window. The scene where the villains dragged Bond and Medena over the coral reefs, intending to make them bleed into the water, thus attracting the sharks which were meant to finish them off, was very good, and also involved one of the more intelligent escape scenes of the Bond series. There was excellent tension created by the rock-climbing scene near the end of the film - as Bond scales a ridiculously tall cliff in order to gain access to a ridiculously out-of-the-way hideout &#150; particularly when there is a bad guy above Bond, trying to cut him loose and cause him to fall to his horrible, bloody death below.Clearly, there is no shortage of satisfying action and fast paced scenes of good tension, but it seems that for every good scene in the film, there is a pathetic discrepancy of some sort. In one of the chase scenes, Bond jumps off of a tall fence, using a pool umbrella as some sort of parachute. That's not only unnecessary and far too lowbrow a stunt for a Bond film, it's also just dumb. And then in one of the car chase scenes, there is a car full of villains behind Bond who are firing at him like crazy, and then when they are just beside him, they don't even shoot at him when he smugly nods at them. I guess they were afraid that at such a close range, someone might actually get hurt if they opened fire. And of course, what kind of a chase scene would that have been if at least one car of villains didn't winds up sitting neatly on top of a tree? I don't even think I have to mention how ridiculous the indentogram was. During the cool skiing scene that I mentioned above, some poor guy gets a pie in the face for no apparent reason. After the excellent ski/motorcycle chase scene, the villain on the motorcycle, after having crashed badly enough so that the bike was un-rideable, actually picks it up and shot-puts it at Bond. During the rock-climbing scene near the end, Bond suffers a fall from the rocks that would have cut him in half in real life, or at least broken his back. And not only that, but he performs the superhuman feat of coming up with some magical trick with his shoelaces that allows him to just climb right back up the rope as though it was a ladder with rungs.However, despite all this trash, For Your Eyes Only did have one of the better stories for a Bond film. The effort to recover the infinitely valuable British encryption device known as ATAC is made much more complex by the character of the Bond girl (how's THAT for innovative!). Medena's (the Bond girl) parents have been killed by the people looking to recover the ATAC because her father has been assigned to search for it, and being Greek, she intends to avenge them because as she says, `Greek women always avenge their loved ones.' Unfortunately, if she avenges her loved ones too soon, she'll kill Bond's only chance of finding out who is behind the whole operation. This is the kind of thing that you see in this film that is not very common in other Bond films, and that makes a rare effort to put a new spin on this otherwise traditional plot.Oh, I don't want to forget the underwater scene where Bond gives Medena what is supposed to be a romantic look, but it's ruined by the fact that he looks like E.T. in a wetsuit. But the movie is still good (Moore still doesn't have Connery's endless charm, though). The villains are very well presented (except for the fact that they all wear cute little birdies on their chests), and the action sequences actually seem to have a little thought put into them. There was a lot of crap, but there were also a lot of acceptable excesses in this film, which is unusual. Usually when a Bond film goes overboard, it goes WAY overboard. Roger Moore still screws up the Bond character, but the film is still able to survive his strained performance.

What makes this one  interesting to me is the small way it pushes the envelope of sex by introducing the  underage BiBi (though she was played by a 22 year old).

Yet again the movie is full with car chases, beautiful woman, underwater scene's and chases in the snow. In other words a Typical Bond flick. But that also is the only problem with this movie, it isn't really original or special enough.Roger Moore plays the Bond character with lot's of humor and delivers some fine and funny one liners throughout the movie in his own typical way.The movie is filled with some wonderful and stereotype Bond villains. Julian Glover plays the main villain that for once doesn't want to destroy or take over the world. John Wyman plays the stereotype strong villain and Emile Leopold Locque that doesn't speak one word during the entire movie is a wonderful villain who's played by Michael Gothard whom unfortunately committed suicide 11 years later.Carole Bouquet is my personal favorite Bond girl of all time, mainly because she doesn't act or look like a typical Bond girl and because of her cool crossbow!The crazy hip 80's soundtrack is from Bill Conti. The music still work surprising well for the movie even though it is heavily outdated. The wonderful theme song is from Sheena Easton and is one of the better ones.One of the most entertaining Bond flicks that is very re-watchable.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"along with A View to a Kill, the cheesiest, worst bond ever","Date":"2 December 2002","Score":"7 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller","Review":"  I hated everything about this movie.

This movie is simply mediocre, the girl was underused, no characters were truly developed or explained.  The girl shows up, she's his buddy, they beat the bad guy, they screw around, end of story.  The blond skater seemed way too easy, I find it hard to believe that a man that looks like Moore would be able to seduce a woman, just by his sight.  The villains were dumb.

However, it does pass the time reasonably well and although none of the action sequences is among the best of the series, the film is packed with a wide variety of them in all sorts of locations; there's some helicopter action during the silly pre-credit sequence (that pays homage to On Her Majesty's Secret Service by showing Bond's dead wife as well as long-time villain Blofeld), there's a long and fairly innovative skiing scene, there is a brief but memorable ice hockey fight, and there's a tense climbing scene, among others.The film might be set apart from at least some of the others in two respects. First of all, with its slightly cheesy synth score and jovial tone, Bond's transition into the 80s is not unnoticed. Secondly, it downplays Bond as a womanizer by having him reject one of the love interests (not without reason considering the age difference), and the relationship between Bond and Melina Havelock is quite delicate (and helped by the cute theme). Trivial differences aside, however, if there's one Bond film I would never think about again, this might be it.

The volkswagon chase scene where the volkswagon rolls over about 100 times yet keeps driving.What really shows bad this movie was is, ask the average bond fan to name out the villain. In Live and Let die, it was Kananga, in Man with the golden gun, Scaramanga. In TSWLM, it was Stromberg. In Moonraker (a little harder here) it was Drax. In octopussy, Kamal Khan. In VTAK, ZOrin. Yet everybody I ask seems to ask about this one cant name him. Reason being he didn't stand out like the other villains did. Even if Live and Let Die and Man with the golden gun sucked, at least they had decent villains. FYEO didn't even have that. I will admit it has probably the 3rd or 4th best theme song, behind 1) View to a Kill 2) The spy who loved me 3) Octopussy 4) tied with Live and Let die.But as far as the movie itself, its no better than Moonraker, in fact I only rate it, in terms of just the Moore movies, as the worst of them all, at best its tied with man with the golden gun for a tie for 6th.

However, this one and A View to a Kill are at least watchable.For one thing, the plot is closely modeled on the best Bond movie, From Russia With Love. All Bond has to do is retrieve a coding device. His main opponent is a blond hunk who's even stronger than he is. The supporting players act like real people most of the time. And, best of all, they cut way back on all the gimmicks and gadgets and let Bond use his fists and wits to get out of his predicaments. Unfortunately, this is still Roger Moore we're talking about and every time he does a stunt all believability goes out the window.  There's also the dreadful scene with Blofeld at the beginning and an obnoxious teeny-bopper. I would have preferred seeing more of Ilse and a lot less of Bibi.In fact, I don't really like seeing Americans in Bond films. They never seem to fit in.Anyways, this one isn't as mindnumbingly stupid as most of the other Roger Moore films so it's a diverting way to spend an evening. I'm not sure I'd rank it in the top ten Bond movies, but it's probably close, and it was certainly the best one since On Her Majesty's Secret Service.I'd still rather rent From Russia With Love or Where Eagle Dare, but that's just me.

After all that Blofeld did and was to say this is anticlimactic is an understatement.

The only area where it ranks low are the villains - truly some of the most unmemorable in the series. In the second half, the tension unwinds a bit with a long, tedious underwater sequence that succeeds only in slowing the film down. And the rapid night-to-day change as Bond hunts down Locque is one of the most obvious blunders in the series. Despite these flaws, however, FYEO will always remain one of my favorite Bond films.

As I make my way through the Bond series it seems that the majority of the films get positive ratings and then there are a few that seem to start a fight among fans as some love it and some hate it. It seems FOR YOUR EYES ONLY is a film that manages to split fans down the middle but sadly I'm going to have to agree with those who dislike the film. I think there are many flaws in the film but I think the biggest is the actual story, which is pretty familiar stuff that doesn't offer anything new. It's easy to see that the entire thing is going step by step for what you'd expect a film in the Bond series to do. You know whose going to sleep with Bond. You know who the bad guys are going to be. You know which friend is going to get taken down first. You know which love is going to die. Everything follows a pattern that I could see coming from a mile away and this is never good in a film like this. Another problem I had was with the villain who was simply boring and never made a splash in the film. Yet another problem is that there just wasn't anything here that really drew me in. I found the material to be rather lame and I thought the majority of the action scenes were fairly boring and never jumped off the screen. Moore seemed to be bored in the part as there wasn't any energy or charm but perhaps the weak supporting cast was just holding him down. Heck, I really didn't like the title song, the opening credits or the music score. So, what did I like here? I thought the opening sequence with the helicopter was well done and the pay-off was pretty funny as well. I also thought the cinematography was top notch and there's no question that the scenery was nice. With that said, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY ranks towards the bottom of the series.
