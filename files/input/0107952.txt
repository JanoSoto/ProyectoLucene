[{"Title":"Jafar is back and he's definitely not here for a cup of tea","Date":"10 February 2004","Score":"27 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" As rare as it is, Disney will have good sequels that will come out and one of those is Return of Jafar, even though this one you can tell the animation isn't as great as the original and Robin Williams skipped out on this one, I still really enjoyed this Disney sequel. I thought it was pretty cool to see how Jafar would get his revenge as a genie, you thought he was a scary villain just as a sorcerer? Imagine him as a genie with all the powers in the world! It's pretty crazy, but I like how they are continuing the story between Aladdin and Jasmine and how Aladdin's life has been since the Sultan has invited him to stay within the castle and to love his daughter. Plus we have the genie, Abu, and the carpet back, how could you not just fall in love with them again? Return of Jafar is a great sequel and has a very good story.The story opens with a band of robbers arriving in their hideout with their latest spoils. Just as their incompetent leader, Abis Mal, rouses the ire of his men, Aladdin and Abu steal the treasures back and distribute most of it among the poor of Agrabah, with the exception of a jewel flower, which Aladdin intends to give to Jasmine. Upon their arrival, Jasmine announces to Aladdin a surprise which the Sultan intends to reveal at this evening's dinner. Meanwhile, in the desert, Iago manages to dig himself and Jafar's genie lamp out of the sand, into which the Genie had fired them. Jafar orders Iago to release him at once, but Iago, tired of being treated badly by Jafar, throws the lamp into a nearby well. He returns to Agrabah, hoping to convince Aladdin that he had served Jafar only because he had hypnotized him just like the Sultan. He meets Aladdin and insists that he is innocent, but Aladdin is not fooled and tries to capture him. While chasing Iago, Aladdin has a run-in with Abis Mal and some of his men, but is saved by Iago. Now willing to give Iago a fair chance, Aladdin returns with him to the palace, where they are greeted by Genie, who has returned from seeing the world and is glad to be home in Agrabah. That night, the Sultan announces that he wants to make Aladdin his new grand vizier. Trying to draw on the good mood, Aladdin attempts to persuade the Sultan to forgive Iago, but Iago inadvertently ruins the dinner and the Sultan and Jasmine are furious. With Iago's help, though, Jasmine eventually reconciles with Aladdin. Meanwhile, Jafar, by luck, is found by Abis Mal. As Jafar is a genie, he is handicapped by the incompetence of his new master. Jafar desires to be free so that he can get revenge on Aladdin and rule Agrabah, but needs Mal's co-operation to do this. Once in the palace, Jafar reveals himself to Iago and forces him to play along with his plans. The next day, Aladdin and the Sultan depart to have a discussion at a place suggested by Iago. After they leave, Jafar confronts the Genie and Abu in the Palace gardens and shows his power, imprisoning the pair. When Aladdin thanks Iago, he is ambushed by Abis Mal, and the sulton is captured.Even though Iago was a great little villain sidekick, I think I liked him better turning on Aladdin's side and seeing him rescue the gang from Jafar was just awesome. Even though the soundtrack isn't as memorable as the first Aladdin, I still loved Iago's song I'm looking out for me. I'm a little sad that the same cast didn't return, but these voices did just as well and the story still worked. I really did like this sequel, even if others didn't, I think it was just a great way to continue Aladdin's journey with the genie, Jasmine, Abu and the others. Plus it was cool to see Jafar come back and just defend his title against Aladdin and the genie was awesome, you really don't wanna mess with Jafar. Well even if Aladdin did end up winning the day, I think Jafar is still a pretty cool bad dude. I do recommend that if you get the chance to see this movie, take it, it's a fun sequel and I personally enjoyed it.7/10 "},{"Title":"Not as good as the first one","Date":"28 January 2008","Score":"16 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" The Return of Jafar isn't as good as Aladdin but, to be fair, it isn't that bad for a Disney sequel either. There are much worst Disney sequels than this, made after this.The Return of Jafar continues the story of the original Aladdin now Aladdin and Jasmine are married and live together in the palace, the genie returns from his vacations, Iago escapes from Jafar and becomes a «good guy» and Jafar returns with the help of a new villain (a thief called Abis Mal).Naturally that this movie isn't as good as the first one, like I said. Why? There are many reasons why. The story is more lame. The artwork looks more poor comparing to the first one (which is more refined and more according to Disney's standards). The humor isn't as funny and classic. The colorful imagination, creativity and magic of the first one are gone. The characters seem somehow to have lost their personality.Speaking of the characters, let me start by Iago. He has the same general sarcasm and I like the idea that he becomes a «good guy», but let's be frank he's way funnier in the first one. Jafar is now more annoying and not as humorous as in the first one. Aladdin, Jasmine and the Sultan seem to have lost some of their maturity. The Genie is still funny, but without the colorful imagination and brilliant sense of humor he's got on the first one. The whole movie in general doesn't hold a candle to the original, although it is still entertaining enough. Besides, there is no Robin Williams here, which is a deep lost. It also becomes tiring to see Jafar so many times as a Red Genie. The soundtrack itself is nowhere near as impressing and memorable as on the first one - in fact, none of the songs here really capture our attention and hearts.Overall, this is not a bad movie. For kids it is just as recommendable and entertaining as the first one, but for older people the first one is, without a doubt, the best choice.

This movie isn't terrible, but it is fair to say, it is the worst out of the Aladdin trilogy. If you want a really good DTV sequel, check out Aladdin and the King of Thieves (the best DTV sequel) or Beauty and the BeastThe Enchanted Christmas.The characters were less appealing here.Most of the voice actors return, but all of them sound different. Aladdin and Jasmine were less mature here, as well as the Sultan. Jafar wasn't as frightening or as humorous as he was in the first movie, and Iago is sometimes annoying, unlike King of Thieves, when he is actually funny. Dan Castellanetta does a serviceable job as the genie(he is funny at times), but it just isn't the same without Robin Williams. The worst character was Abis Mal, I absolutely hate that character. He just grates on my nerves. The animation sometimes looks nice, but at other times, it has a rather nasty quality about it. Almost all the characters look poorly drawn, and I really didn't want to say this. Even the Genie wasn't up to top animation standard. It wasn't the backgrounds as such, some were very nice, it was the character animation that was the problem.As for the songs, they aren't dreadful, but they are the weakest batch in any Disney movie. Iago's singing made my ears bleed, and Second Rate sounded as though Jonathan Freeman was struggling with the song. (No wonder, it is very hard)I don't know about you but the old woman in the chair bit I found creepy as a kid. The best song in my opinion is there is nothing in the world quite like a Friend which has a decent melody. Also Liz Callaway has a nice singing voice. I really liked the incidental music though, and the scene of the winged horses.The story was the biggest problem, it went at such a slow pace. Also the villain back for revenge formula was over-familiar, and has been done so much better before. I also disliked the fact that Iago seemed to be the main character, when he was truly irritating here, and some of the dialogue is very lame, there was one part when Aladdin says something that is meant to be funny and he raises his eyebrows cheekily, but I found myself groaning than laughing. I'm sorry, that's my view. On a positive note, this film actually has one of the best climaxes in a DTV sequel, and the voice acting if different was decent especially Jonathan Freeman as Jafar.This is a very disappointing sequel, especially when it was released two years after the original. but on the bright side, it isn't as bad as the Cinderella and Jungle Book sequels, which are both thinly plotted. 6/10.

But Aladdin (who is suddenly a poor street rat again) stops them.Then, the main moronic thief escapes from Aladdin and finds Jafar's lamp, sets him free and the plot unfolds. If by plot, you mean, Iago basically deciding if he's a good guy or a bad guy. (Sad plot, ain't it?) With cheesy half-arsed animation, and dweeby songs, this sequel just is a sappy one hour waste of time. Aladdin and Jasmine are not married in this film, (even though they married at the end of the first movie) and the only really memorable scene is a brief goof, where the Sultan loses his eyebrows for a split second. I truly believe that if poor (late) Mr. Walter Disney had seen this idea, he would've cried.I give it a 1 out of 10.

From what I remember, I was not disappointed at all. However, after discovering that I still liked the popular 1992 Disney flick a lot after many years, I rented The Return of Jafar to see what I thought of it after all these years, and while I'm still not one of the haters, I can now understand the criticism! Jafar, who is now a genie trapped in his lamp, and his parrot, Iago escape from the Cave of Wonders and work their way up to the desert surface. Iago gets out of the lamp, and Jafar expects him to rub it so he can get out and return to Agrabah, where he plans to have his revenge on Aladdin! Instead, Iago turns against the former grand vizier, and drops the lamp in a well, with Jafar trapped inside! However, when a thief named Abis Mal finds the lamp in the well, Jafar is finally out, and is ready for his revenge! To make it worse for Aladdin, Abis Mal wants revenge on him as well, due to a recent encounter in Agrabah! Meanwhile, Iago has returned to the city, and obviously, most people do not trust him, but Aladdin begins to. Is this a good idea?! There are several things that make The Return of Jafar far inferior to its predecessor. First of all, some of the characters are not quite the same. Aladdin and Princess Jasmine seem a bit sillier and less mature than they are in the first movie, and there are some ridiculous scenes involving the two, such as the one where the Sultan praises Aladdin, and Aladdin then looks over to Jasmine with a smug look on his face, and she looks back at him with look of romance (a rather silly one). Another character who is not the same is the Genie. He is responsible for a lot of the humour in 1992's Aladdin, but isn't usually funny in this film. This time, he is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, instead of Robin Williams, and Castellaneta voices many funny characters on The Simpsons, but as the Genie, I guess he's not so great. That reminds me, this film is generally a lot less funny than its predecessor. Two other downsides I can think of are the animation (not too bad, but certainly not as good), and the forgettable songs, none of which have ever fully stuck in my head, and some of which still aren't stuck in there at all!Sequels aren't usually as good or better than their predecessors, but even with that in mind, this one is still disappointing. Since I at least found an occasional laugh in the film, as well as some excitement, I give it a 6/10. Nevertheless, I found the film a bit bland overall, lacking several things that made the classic original so great. For hardcore fans of Disney's Aladdin, this straight-to-video sequel might be worth checking out, but if you decide to do so, don't be surprised if you find that a lot is missing from the original! Judging by the few episodes of the Aladdin TV series I've seen, it seems to have the same problems as The Return of Jafar, or very similar ones. Fortunately, at least these problems did not persist in Aladdin and the King of Thieves, the final installment in the franchise, which is definitely somewhat superior to what came in between.

The Return of Jafar is no where near as good as Aladdin, but it is still generally good. This really wasn't even supposed to be a sequel. It was supposed to be the first five episodes of the animated series, thus explaining the change in animation. The story is fairly good and the movie has some good songs. And in defense of Dan Castellaneta, he does a good job as the Genie and sounds sort of like Robin Williams. Don't judge him just because of Williams' performance.

Characters the only disappointment was Robin Williams' absence, but you have to blame Disney for that (they went back on a promise they'd made to Williams regarding the first film just to make more money).Animation was the only major disappointment here.

It is, apparently(I haven't watched very many of them... this one was given to me), one of the few Disney sequels that is actually a direct sequel, rather than the story of the kids of the main character or characters of the original film. It's a mixed bag. There aren't many songs, and one of them may even just be (some) new lyrics for one from the first... but on the other hand, both Iago and Jafar get a song(each)... the latter was supposed to have one in the first, it just didn't quite work out, and Freeman(Jonathan, not Morgan) certainly does sing well. The pacing isn't too bad, I guess. The plot certainly could have been better. Abis Mal is not that interesting of a character. The themes aren't as good and the developments just don't work as well as those of the first. The animation varies, some bits are downright poor when compared to that of the first. The energy and creativity in no way measures up to that of the first. I realize that the following is not necessarily something they could have fixed... but Castellaneta just does not make as good a Genie as Williams. Sorry, Dan... I like ya, I do(honestly possibly more than Rob), but some parts just suit certain actors better, and, let's face it, Genie is essentially Williams as an animated character. Dan tries, but it just doesn't work. In fact, it seems almost like they changed the character of Genie, either to move it away from the Williams performance or to suit the new guy, and if there was ever a character in fiction best suited for a fast-paced stand-up comedian, rather than an actor perhaps best known for his voice-work portraying one of the slowest, most dim-witted characters in the history of animation(it should be noted that I *love* The Simpsons, the first many years, until it turned sucky)... yeah, that character would have to be Genie. The film is a mere 70 minutes or so long, and only about an hour of it is actual film. There are dramatic parts, but the film is just not the adventure that the first was. It's nowhere near as entertaining... but hey, the actors do return(save for Williams), and at least Freeman does still do well(Gottfried was... not as good as he was in the first, a pity, since his character, Iago, is featured so heavily in this, especially early on... maybe that was the problem, he was overexposed). The DVD... could be better. The menus aren't as attractive as those of the DVD of Aladdin. The extras... well, there are three. One that takes you directly to any of the songs in the film(which, sadly, serves to underline just how few there are... and the DVD of Aladdin actually had other recordings of the songs featured, as well as deleted/unused songs). One that will have Aladdin describe how people wish in different parts of the world, divided into brief clips. And lastly, a feature that will allow you three wishes granted by Jafar... that one is actually decent enough. All in all, I'm not sure there's terribly much lost from not watching this. I recommend it to fans of Disney, Aladdin, and/or those who want to see more of Jafar... and it helps to not be terribly picky. 5/10 "},{"Title":"No Robin Williams is a bad thing!","Date":"5 October 2002","Score":"8 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  Disney has a reputation of doing bad sequels.

A sequel with them didn't make as much sense because Uncle Scar was dead and gone. another example is Beauty and the Beast because the Beast is now turned back to a real man/prince. Aladdin though did leave us with something to work with because Jafar wasn't destroyed, he was just prisoned in a genie lamp (since he wished to be the most powerful genie), so all that had to happen is for someone to find his lamp and rub it. So in Return of Jafar, Aladdin, Abu and Carpet meet Abis Mal and his criminal friends and make enemies with them. Meanwhile, Iago gets them out of the Cave and is blasted out and ordered to let Jafar out. Iago, however, is sick and tired of being mistreated by Jafar so he puts his lamp in a well and bails to town. he thinks he can make it on his own, realizes he can't and after saving Aladdin gets in his good graces and later they get Jasmine to tolerate him...so all they need is the Sultan on their side......meanwhile Abis Mal's gang turns on him, but run away in fear after Mal rubs the lamp. Jafar, however is forced to obey his master and eventually manipulates Abis Mal to helping him and scares Iago into helping him.......i won't get into anymore parts of the movie, but it's a really great sequel because of many reasons..1) a built in story from part one, Jafar wanting payback....2) Iago's character development and 3) the action wasn't half bad and the movie doesn't seem long. it's (in my book) a sequel to check out for Disney and it's much better than part 3 where i felt it was longer and just duller. if you watch the first Aladdin and want to know the end result of the two villains, check this out.

It took a whole lot of years from the first time I watched that one and till now, when I watched the sequel. And I'm kinda glad. Had I seen this when I was little, I might have been disappointed. Why? Well, let me tell ya!The Return of Jafar is not even comparable to Aladdin. Aladdin (1992) is one of Disneys greatest movies. The Return of Jafar is a cheap looking typical made-for-TV animation feature. The animation is cheap. I mean, it doesn't even seem to follow Disneys own 12 principles of animation. It's shoddy, jittery and sloppy. A lot of the time the drawings are down right bad. It's very clear that the budget for this was just a fraction of the budget for Aladdin (1992).Genies voice has been replaced with Home.. uhm, Dan Castellaneta. He did a good job, though. Besides, I actually prefer the Norwegian dub, for Aladdin, so I'm not very familiar with Williams Genie anyway.The movie is not all bad, though. It's short, which is good. It's nice to see these characters again, cheap as they may look. The story is, well, there hardly is a story at all, really. It even has some plot holes. (not that I care) But the movie is, you know, made for kids, and gets the job done I guess. It's just very generic, and nothing like the excellent quality that is Aladdin (1992).Just have to add I feel so mean when I slam the animation so hard, because someone still spent hour upon hour drawing this stuff. Animation is beyond time consuming. I know, because I've done it myself. OK. Anyway, you'll find plenty other, better animations feature films than this. That's my last word!

I watched the original again then the sequel so I could connect and remember the way the characters were. First, I really thought that Jasmine would interrogate more about where Aladdin got that flower jewel thingy since Aladdin said that he stole it. If you were the princess who didn't know where he stole it from or where he gave the rest of the treasures, you sure would ask him about it. Also, I was surprised to see that they became a bit or more (actually) romantic. Like in the first movie, Jasmine was a bit of a hard- to-get princess and in this sequel, she became like.. too romantic? Also, they became less serious. There really are a lot of changes in the characters. Also, the parrot was very loyal to Jafar in the first movie and I couldn't believe that he just turned away like that to Jafar. Also, I was confused about the Genie thing. Haha because Aladdin's Genie or Robin Williams or in here, Dan Castellanetta was very kind and he never hurt Aladdin when he was his master. Can a genie hurt their master? I mean, when they are currently their master? Because Jafar tried to hit that man. Also, I was confused why Genie still has that thing on his wrist. In the original movie, it was broken or destroyed during the last part, right?Anyways, Dan Castellanetta did a good job with being the voice of Genie here. At first, I really thought it was Robin Williams. The voice was kinda similar to his that I didn't know about it until I read the names of the casts haha Same with Liz Callaway (singing voice of Jasmine). I didn't notice it at first too but I already knew that it was not Lea who was going to be the singing voice. I like Liz but I like Lea more. However, Liz still did a good job here and so with Brad Kane and the other voice actors. The thing I miss the most about the original are the songs, which aren't really much in this sequel. I just love A Whole New World and Friend Like Me that at first, I couldn't accept the new songs haha I really miss the original one and I was expecting for a good sequel with not much changes and with a more reasonable and great plot. Well, as the saying goes, Nothing beats the original. We really can't expect that the sequel would be as good as its predecessor.

Well, at first, when I watched it a few times, I seemed to have been disappointed in the first few minutes, but I don't think it's a terrible movie. The reason why is because some of the characters weren't as likable as they were in original despite the Genie being the best character throughout the movie.

There's Nothing In A World Quite Like A World has a decent melody and You're Only Second Rate was OK, but Iago's singing irritated me to death (not to mention the character itself was so annoying to being with) and the beginning songs were forgettable.

He and Jasmine weren't married yet, but they should be soon.       What nobody expected was right at that moment in the desert, Iago the parrot was digging himself and Jafar the genie up from the sand. Iago decided to ditch Jafar and go off on his own. Be his own man. He get's caught by Aladdin, but he soon feels for him when Iago explains his predicament. Aladdin also keeps Iago hidden from Jasmine and Sultan. Right at that moment, another old friend pops in Genie! He's back from his trip around the world. He sings about it and shows Aladdin and Jasmine the places he went to. Iago doesn't stay secret for long and Jasmine is quite angry at Aladdin, but Iago straightened it all out and they liked him. Unfortunately that night, Abis Mal found Jafar's lamp and released him. Jafar desparately wanted revenge on Aladdin so he captured Genie, Abu, Sultan and Jasmine and framed Aladdin for the murder of the Sultan. He was about to be beheaded when Iago freed Genie who freed Aladdin. All Abis Mal had to do was wish Jafar free then everybody would be in big trouble! Of course, Abis Mal had wishes of $$$ first. Genie said the only way to stop Jafar would be to destroy his lamp. Being a genie, Jafar couldn't kill anybody but you'd be surprised what you can live through! Iago acted bravely, the lamp was destroyed and so was Jafar! He exploded in a cloud of smoke and was gone forever.         The Sultan told Aladdin he would one day be Sultan, but Aladdin turned him down because he didn't want a life of just sitting around in a palace when there was so much to do out in the world. Iago tried to talk him out of it but Aladdin was serious. Well, our story has a happy ending, leaving Abis Mal hanging in a tree without his third wish.          A worthy sequel to Aladdin. Sadly, Robin Williams does not return to do Genie. I'm sure he had his reasons, though. Instead they got Dan Homer Simpson Castellaneta to do Genie. Gilbert Gottfried returns as Iago.

Aladdin was (in my opinion) one of the better Disney movies, and Jafar was one of the best villains. I was hoping something would come of his imprisonment, and very much wanted to like this movie.I tried, but it just didn't happen. I didn't like it.I acknowledge that it was direct-to-video. Yes, the sound was a pale imitation of the movie soundtrack and seemed to consist of a handful of themes repeated endlessly; yes, the animation was choppy and distracting, and the coloring was nothing approaching the richness of the original. But I wasn't expecting something made for video to be as good as a theater release, and if the richness of the plot and characters of this movie had even approached the original film, I would've been satisfied.They didn't. The returning characters have been reduced to cardboard cutouts of their original selves, with little charisma or energy (with the exception of Iago, who was still as amusing as ever.) The new characters are just as bland. The script is stilted, and the voice actors overact half the time and underact the other half. This baffles me, since most of them seem to be returning from the original movie, and the acting from that was much better. (And no, Dan Castellaneta isn't Robin Williams. I didn't expect him to be Robin Williams. If you look at his performance without comparing it to Robin William's performance, well, he does just fine.)The plot, to avoid spoilers, was predictable and full of continuity errors. I honestly think that a villain like Jafar could've thought of a better evil plan, and without involving inept helpers.If I had to pick one word to describe this movie it would be mediocre. And it can't even be entirely blamed on its direct-to-video status, since the other Aladdin sequel was much better.

He has since moved into the castle and is still having a romance with Jasmine, daughter of the Sultan. The film opens with Aladdin stealing from a thief named Abis Mal (voiced by Seinfeld's Jason Alexander), and giving the jewels to the poor (ala Robin Hood).An angry Abis Mal retreats to the desert, where he accidentally releases genie Jafar, who seeks revenge on Aladdin. With the help of the thief, Jafar plots revenge.Meanwhile, back at the palace, Aladdin has taken Iago the Parrot (Gilbert Gottfried), Jafar's ex-confidante, under his wing (so to speak). And the Blue Genie (this time voiced by Dan Homer Simpson Castellanetta, instead of Robin Williams) shows up after touring the world, singing There's nothing in the world quite like a friend! and dancing around.The Return of Jafar seems more like a worthy sequel to 1992's box office smash Aladdin, and it isn't like other countless straight-to-video sequels that are pure, unadulterated crap.The animation is a bit more bland than it was in the first, but the characters are all voiced by the same actors (save the Blue Genie--who sounds like Williams anyway),  and the story is not entirely stupid. It's actually pretty fun, and seems like those old legends you hear of in ancient tales.And such as in the original, this film is filled with sly references to modern-day things. The first had spoofs/imitations of Woody Allen, Arnold Schwarzenegger, slicer/dicer ads, and much, much more. This film uses a lot of objects that weren't even invented at the time, such as a pool table (wasn't that in this flick?) and the Genie uses other references to modern-day inventions when he comes back from visiting the world.Aladdin was one of the best of 1992, and this is more than just a worthy sequel, but a worthy continuation of the story (to be concluded in the mess-of-a-sequel Aladdin and the King of Thieves, which is one to miss).3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"The worst sequel to anything I've ever seen.","Date":"13 March 2008","Score":"6 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" You know, this film actually has excellent animation with loads of potential, but every last strand of it's potential is wasted with the film's awful animation direction.

The whole film showcases possibly the least realistic animation I've yet to see in a Disney film.While the backgrounds are very detailed and expressive, some of the characters, even the main characters look noticeably wonky and off-model in some scenes, As for the humour, it's just plain silly for the most part; silly and childish, which instead of making me laugh, just left me rolling my eyes in contempt. In fact, there's basically nothing until the genie's appearance that seems to even try to be funny.Most of the music is forgettable at best, and when a song is half right decent, what puts me off about it is that it doesn't sound Indian or Aladdin-esquire at all.The only thing that stops me from either falling asleep, or turning of the TV screen, is the genie, which this time, is voiced by Dan Castellaneta (Homer Simpson). His voice-work, as an imitation of Williams', isn't particularly great, and I feel it was a bit of a let down, considering how versatile Dan's voice is in real life, and here, he just sounds like a mildly tweaked version of Homer Simpson. But in the end, it really doesn't matter, considering how many other things that absolutely bomb in this film.This film is worth watching only for Dan's appearance; if you're not a fan of his work, and you are a fan of the original, then seriously, avoid this one if you don't particularly feel like ruining what the first one did to you. This film is only for the Aladdin diehards, and obsessive collectors; everyone else, if you think it might have a chance of living up to the original, think again.On it's own, this film is awful. In comparison to the stunning original, it's not only terrible, but it's an insult to every thing that made the first film so special. The only way I would, and could ever like this film, is if no-one else on the entire planet liked it. Unfortunately, there are going to be people out there that do, so I see it as nothing more than a bad, pointless sequel that did not need to be made.

Yes, Dan Castellaneta Does Excellent with Homer Simpsion in the Simpsions but hes no Robin William when it comes to the gene.

When Jaffar is the Big red ugly gene you can just see the color come off of him on certain parts. Another opinion of mine is that it seems like you just tried to get this movie done as quick as possible and you didn't care.

Heh heh.Sequels suck (a word I don't like using, but necessary here). Usually. TROJ a perfect example. Maybe the kids will like it. But I was no older than 14, maybe 15, by the time I saw this and it almost made me sick.What Disney have in effect done is to ruin all the good work done by Aladdin. What was good about the first one? A lot of things, such as1) THE GENIE 2) Jafar 3) The fact that Jafar (and Iago) was defeated without being destroyed 4) Iago was a very suitable henchman for Jafar who was loyal to his master and didn't have an ounce of goodness in him. 5) The other characters, while a bit sugary, were quite believeable.Just a warning to readers who want to see this movie and want nothing given away this next bit forcibly reveals a few non-critical plot elements.So just what has Disney done? They have slammed good points 3-5, overall weakened no.1 and only no.2 enhanced in any way. Even that could have been left alone. I'll keep to point-format and address them one by one. 1) The good thing about the first one was that the genie wasn't over-used. Every time he WAS brought in it was something special. In TROJ, and subsequent 'episodes' spun off from it, he  just goes too far and is over-used, removing the novelty of his approach. It ceases to be so spectacular. In other words, you CAN have too much of a good thing... well, most good things. I'm not too critical on this point; even without Robin Williams, the Genie (now played by none other than Homer Simpson) does a creditable job. Just a couple of questions though The genie's arm-cuffs disappeared when he was freed; why is he wearing them again now? and Why does the genie spend all his time around Aladdin now when he didn't want to be tied down at all? 2) Jafar (same voice) does an excellent job and is the best part of the movie. His genie antics are quite believeable and he steals the show from the (good) Genie and everyone else. But there's a downside - see the next point. 3) Because Jafar wasn't killed off in the first one, they brought him back, and he wasn't so fortunate the second time round, apparently - I didn't see any bones, but if he was still alive, they would have brought him back for subsequent episodes. This was the most sickening part of all, to kill off a worthy villian who was just blossoming. And especially the way they did it, his 'death' seemed to take about 10 minutes. 4) This was the second most sickening thing for me. How could a perfectly able villain, like Iago, turn into a good guy? 'Specially after the first one where he despised 'kissing up to that chump and his chump daughter' which is what he ends up doing. Even when Jafar completely forgives him, and appears to have won him back, Iago, without cause or reason, SETS FREE the genie and is ultimately the one who kills Jafar. Iago in Aladdin 1 would not have done that in an eternity. 5) Disney opted to toy with the remainder of the characters. Aladdin, even though he lives in the palace, still cannot dress respectibly for most of the film and is still chased by Razoul. The other characters, relegated to minor roles, disappoint Rajah (formerly kittenish) is now savage, Jasmine contrary, the Sultan no longer easy-going, and the carpet badly faded.Young children who don't understand such things may not mind and  instead actually enjoy this film.When I first saw an ad for this movie, in fact, I thought it was really good that they'd brought Jafar back, but having watched the whole thing, I wished they'd left him in the Cave of Wonders to chill out as planned at the end of the 1st one by the Genie. I'd rather forget this one ever happened. Jafar alone prevents it from getting the worst possible mark. 2/10PS Disney to an extent redeems itself with a third movie in the series, but it can't begin to account for the damage of this monstrosity.

Aladdin now lives in the palace with Princess Jasmine, and Genie comes back from his journeys or whatever. Unfortunately, they do not know that Jafar and Iago are not finished yet. Iago escapes from the lamp, and Jafar later gets released by the TV series' best villain, Abis Mal. Jafar is now a genie, and plans to use his evil magic to destroy Aladdin and wreak revenge. The only good thing I can say about this is that Genie is voiced by The Simpsons' Homer Simpson, Dan Castellaneta, but personally Robin Williams is much better. A much better third film, King of Thieves followed. Poor! "},{"Title":"2 words Cash-off. (or Utter Rubbish.)","Date":"30 December 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":" I was one of the mindless individuals mugged into buying the special edition Aladdin box set with 4 DVDs, thinking that this would be a quality buy and that the 2 follow ups to the original movie (Return of Jafar and King of Thieves) would be of somewhat average to good standard. I was wrong.Since putting on Return of Jafar, I couldn't help but think that this sub-standard-day-time-television-cartoon really was a waste of money to purchase and it's sole purpose of being made was to mug Aladdin fans and kids who love Disney.- The animation was shoddy, I would say that Rugrats probably put more effort into their animation than this film.- The plot was just randomly put together. You could see that by one scene where Aladdin is talking to Jasmine and there is a vase with a white tulip and a jeweled flower in it. These items keep disappearing every so often, sometimes showing an empty vase, sometimes one flower, sometimes 2.- The music was horrible. If you have just watched the original movie and loved the music steer clear of this sequel. I think they paid a couple of monkeys a few bananas to knock together some notes on a keyboard and then they just made up a few words to go along with the song (if you can call it a song).Anyways, after watching this sequel, I can happily tell everyone to steer right clear of it, because all it will do is depress you.I voted 2/10 "},{"Title":"worst movie ever","Date":"21 June 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Family","Review":"  I loved Aladdin.

The animators and designers basically don't care what it looks like, and it shows. I rented all three of the Aladdin movies at the same time. After watching Aladdin, I popped in Return Of Jafar. AAAAAHH! what happened! The animation was extremely poor for a Disney film, and what happened to the shading effects?! What happened to the smooth animation?! The magic Carpet looked terrible! The Genie was more pail than blue! Also, the dialogue was poor and the film was too short (one hour, 5 min). Robin Williams did do a better job as the Genie in the original. However, It doesn't take away much from the character and can be easily over looked. The story itself was good, and really expends Iago's character. I give it an 8 out of 10.

This movie, to me, is nothing more than a piece of merchandise designed to milk the Aladdin franchise as far as it can go.  While Dan Castellaneta is adept at doing the voice of Homer Simpson, he sure is no Genie, and it shows.  On the other side of the spectrum is the bad guy, Jafar, one of the more likable Disney villains.  He at least gets a song this time around, but it's forgettable, as are his antics and his inevitable demise.  And his lackey, Abis Mal, is played by Jason Alexander, who turns in an ordinary frantic man George performance. The other actors act pathetically and have pathetic dialogue.  The copy of this movie in my house is broken now.  Thank God.

The first time I saw this movie, I actually kind of liked it. Just goes to show how Disney can sucker people into liking this sort of sub-TV quality stuff. After the first few times, though, I realized that this was complete and utter JUNK!! Normally, I don't judge a movie by its animation quality since it's usually not a big issue to me, but I'll make an exception here. The animation was obviously television quality, which isn't that good to begin with, but they took an excellently animated movie and made it look like a common TV show. I especially take issue with the coloring. The coloring looked about ten times richer in the original movie. The coloring here was more like a total and complete eyesore. Next, I'll say that Dan Castellaneta was okay as the Genie, but (all together now) HE WAS NO ROBIN WILLIAMS! I don't make this kind of argument if the replacement does an excellent job on his own, but he didn't. The magic that Robin Williams created in the first movie was simply not meant to reproduce because it was so completely his own. Yet they did try to recreate it with less than satisfactory results. And Jason Alexander Loved him in Seinfeld and in almost everything else I've seen him in. Why put him here? It was so unnecessary. The other voices were kind of just there. They were nice, but nothing stood out. At least the music was kind of halfway decent. Nothing like Whole New World, but passable. In short, the only reason this movie was ever released was because Disney thought they could make a quick buck from Aladdin. That's the only possible explanation I can think of.

Disneys first ever direct to video sequel and with good reasoning.I am not a big fan of Disney, especially how they take a story and give it a ton of sequels with a lame story just so kids will HAVE to have it and they can make more money on it. This movies production values were low and not as beautiful as part one. Robin Williams being gone hurt it as well, because, lets face it, the genie is the star. I also hated how he had his cuffs back like they were fancy bracelets because Disney felt it looked better. I also hated the music with passion, these songs were so outrageously stupid.Most of the cast is back, Godfrey is on board as the parrot, Jason Alexander shows up here doing a voice and Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer Simpson) does the genie this time.It was a bad movie and I was bored out of my mind. Kids may like it, if they are the kind of kids that like all cartoons. 2/10 stars.

He alone makes this film brilliant, Jonathan freeman is a brilliant actor.
