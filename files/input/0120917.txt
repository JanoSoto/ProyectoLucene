Perfection.","Date":"29 March 2001","Score":"98 out of 108 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Hard to see why it wasn't a wildly popular mega-hit - I have two theories, one charitable, one not.  The charitable theory is that people were put off by the title.  MY heart certainly sank when I heard it.  I mean, just say it out loud - The Emperor's New Groove - now how could a good movie POSSIBLY have a title like that?Yet now, I rather like the title.  It fits the story; it doesn't care if it's fashionable or not; it's just so pleasingly RIGHT - but in an almost indescribable way you'll have to watch the film to find out.  Maybe it WAS a marketing mistake.  Who cares?  I never took seriously the charge that Disney's artistic decisions were made by its marketing department, anyway.That was the charitable explanation for why it made considerably less, inflation adjusted, than every other one of Disney's animated features from Beauty and the Beast on, and failed to even get nominated for a Best Picture Oscar in a year in which they had difficulty coming up with half-plausible candidates.  The uncharitable explanation is probably closer to the truth.  People are idiots.  This is a classic - but it's also animated - by pencil on paper rather than finger on keyboard - so who will ever notice?Doubt me?  You won't once you've seen it.  Everyone to speak of who did reports that it's very, very funny, and they're right - and trust me, nothing is ever THIS funny unless it's clever and witty as well.  It goes without saying that their character animation is unmatched in its brilliance and ... I've already used the words humour and wit?  Well, I'll use them again.  In addition there's a charming dottiness that a merely hip film could never quite capture.  Art direction is perfectly judged and consistent throughout, with a pleasing absence of because-we-can computer effects.Here's just ONE example of what I'm talking about.  One side of the emperor's palace consists of this HUGE golden face, and we find out in a funny scene (but they're all funny) that all excess water is drained out through the nostrils.  But that's not all we see.  We see characters crawling out of the nostrils, we see someone dangling like a big booger on a rope out of one of the nostrils - one snot gag after another - yet no explicit camerawork ever draws our attention to them.  Not only do the characters deliver their lines perfectly deadpan, the camera delivers its images perfectly deadpan.  It's just perfect.Two more things I should mention.  Unlike Disney's other recent features, it never, not even for a second, feels as though the story has been unduly compressed - and at 78 minutes it's a trifle shorter than most.Also, despite the constant hilarity, it's rather touching.No movie I've seen in the past six months has filled me with such joy.  Well, perhaps there have been a few others, but they were all made long ago.

In fact, I'm now beginning to think it's a work of genius. It's clever, unpretentious, fast-paced, and- like Lilo and Stitch- you don't feel that the vision of the film was muddled up by the suits. The characters are not constantly breaking into song, and there is a welcome lack of cloying sentiment. No cutesy talking teacups here! The lightning- fast comic timing, sharp writing and constant loony non sequiturs (i.e. For the last time, we did not order a giant trampoline!) improves upon each viewing, and the voice work is uniformly excellent, from David Spade's hilariously bratty emperor to Patrick Warburton's dim boy-toy Kronk to Eartha Kitt's Yzma (an over-the-top screeching Erte-style villainess with an alleged secret lab who is also scary beyond all reason). You get the impression that everyone involved had lots of fun making this. The art direction, with its whirling cartoon Inca motifs, is simultaneously goofy and gorgeous- and it shows what marvels can be done with nary a pixel in sight. I even love all the local L.A. humor, with even Bob's Big Boy making an appearance. Although I was initially dismayed when I heard that the project, originally entitled, The Kingdom of the the Sun, was to be changed to The Emperor's New Groove, I think in the end the changes were a good thing. Did the world really need yet another bombastic Disney musical?No, I didn't think so either.

In fact, you could be forgiven for thinking that this isn't a Disney movie at all... the only talking animal has a good excuse for yapping in the voice of David Spade, the only romantic relationship is that between Pacha and his wife (and even there it's more the sign of a happily married couple), and apart from the Emperor's Theme Song Guy (He's the hippest cat in creation...) - and Sting over the end credits, but we'll forgive that - no one bursts into song. Plus the emphasis is more on Warner Bros-type energetic humour than usual. No wonder it was a disappointment at the box office; not your traditional Disney movie.Then again, The Rescuers Down Under was an underrated pleasure as well.The story isn't particularly different - you've got the ruler who has to change externally before he can change internally (Beauty and the Beast), Kronk, the good-hearted sidekick of the villain (Yzma) who can't bring himself to kill the hero (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), and so on - but as is often the case it's not so much what the plot is as how it's handled. Although the movie suffers from Is-that...? syndrome - it's too hard not to see Finch from Just Shoot Me! every time Kuzco speaks (strangely enough, even though Pacha's wife has the voice of Wendie Malick from the same show, I never pictured Nina Van Horn... which isn't the case with Fillmore!, where Miss Malick voices Principal Folsom. Go figure) - the movie's speed, energy and high humour rate make it easy to forgive, with Kuzco and the bad guy's sidekick as standouts. The movie's also a bit more self-reverential than other Disney movies, notably in our hero's narration (plus at one point Yzma and Kronk notice they're leaving a blue trail behind them, which turns out to be the trail they leave on the map to the palace illustrating the race between them and our heroes).The surprising thing is that it even works with character - though the Emperor is enough of a self-absorbed hedonist (to a prospective wife Let me guess - you've got a really great personality) to turn off Paris and Nicky Hilton, he and Pacha have a believable relationship throughout the movie, so that by the end we're rooting for him to get turned back into a human. Too bad Marc Shaiman's score was thrown out (he'd have been a natural, as opposed to John Debney), but no sense whining over what might have been. An adventure, a comedy and a drama all in one, The Emperor's New Groove has everything that was notably absent from DreamWorks' own South American-set cartoon The Road to El Dorado (charm, interest, no Elton John overdose and so on) and is the funniest movie from the House of Mouse since Aladdin. It's easier to forgive them for giving the world Dinosaur in 2000 as well.Why DOES she have that lever, anyway?

The Lion King brought back Classic Disney or some such nonsense. The implication is that mega-hits like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin were not good enough. Nope, it was the Lion King which restored dignity to the studio. Dignity which they then squandered on garbage like Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules. On top of this Dreamworks Animation was gearing up to be a serious competitor while Pixar was hogging all of the glory.Such was the success of the Lion King that director Roger Allers was given permission to indulge himself in a vanity piece called Kingdom of the Sun. It was to be an epic, mystical spin on the Prince and the Pauper set in Peru during the time of the Incas as well as a romantic comedy musical with serious weight to the mythology.Honestly, this sounds like the kind of movie that I would have hated. The Disney suits felt the same way, though were even less kind when it came to communicating that opinion to the creative team. The development and production of Kingdom of the Sun dragged on for years with innumerable clashes, arguments, and differences between Allers and Disney. None of the moneymen liked where the film was going. A half-finished version was screened and rejected. Production was shut down. Allers was off the project and Mark Dindal was brought in to replace him. In the process Dinal completely overhauled the movie and changed it into something quite different. And thus Kingdom of the Sun gave birth to The Emperor's New Groove. A serious, mystical epic became an archaic slapstick comedy more in the vein of Looney Tunes than Lion King. And it's all the better for it.Throughout this shambolic development only three people remained constant David Spade as the spoiled emperor Kuzco, Eartha Kitt as the conniving Yzma, and Sting, who would provide the soundtrack. The latter ended up only doing a single song My Funny Friend and Me, but it did get an Academy Award nomination (which it lost to Bob Dylan). Sting's wife Trudi Styler was even commissioned to make a documentary on the production of Kingdom of the Sun and covered every torturous twist during those terrible times. What was supposed to be just an ordinary making-of became a rather notorious stand-alone documentary called The Sweatbox which was such a damning and difficult portrait of the House of Mouse that they have never allowed it to be officially released (and barely acknowledge its existence). Make no mistake, The Emperor's New Groove did not have an easy journey from concept to screen. Far, far from it.When the trailer screened in early 2001 in the UK I was immediately dismissive. I had become tired and jaded of the setting and tone. With The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado in the recent past I was not in the mood for more of the same. I was loudly vocal about how awful the trailer looked. But then something very odd happened...Kuzco turned into a Llama and it became surreal and hyper. I remember squinting and saying Uh...what IS this? I'd much rather take a chance on an odd curiosity than a self-proclaimed epic.The final story sees Emperor Kuzco betrayed by his assistant Yzma who plots to kill him in revenge for being fired. Her lunkhead servant Kronk (perfectly voiced by Patrick Warburton) mixes up the poison potion and instead transforms Kuzco into a Llama. Discarded into the nearby jungle Kuzco teams up with good-natured peasant Pacha, whom he earlier condemned to homelessness. They make a deal - help Kuzco turn back to human and Pacha can keep his community. Together they fight their way through the wilderness back to the palace with Yzma and Kronk close behind, determined to finish the job.TENG moves so fast it will make your head spin. This movie barely takes a breath, so much so that I don't think that the opening and closing titles even lasted a single second. It's just one wonderfully overblown set-piece followed by another. You'll be grinning so hard your face will be in agony. I can't call it anything other than my absolute favorite Disney animation (Big Hero 6 coming in at a close second) but I'm sort of annoyed that it gets such a bad reputation and that its often forgotten.Released in the US in late 2000 the movie received little fanfare and had a horrible dated marketing campaign that was stuck in the mid- 90s. While most Disney movies are shoved in our face and pretty much demand that we go see them this one seems to end up merely being discovered by growing cult of fans. I guess that makes a unique and controversial movie all the more special.

What that summary completely fails to convey is the sheer brilliance of this tale; not only is it blessed with simple but great animation, a cracking pace, a witty script, original jokes and quirky asides, but the whole thing seems to be a lot greater than the sum of its parts. The characters are wonderfully drawn and are some of the most memorable in Disney history; Kronk is hilariously naive and simple (Patrick Warburton does a brilliant voice-job here), David Spade is on top form as the cruelly sarcastic Kuzco (Disney's most despicable hero) and Eartha Kitt's Yzma is a gloriously over-the-top riot - a Disney villainess who tries so hard to be bad and scary that she ends up simply looking a fool who can't even impress a squirrel (if you watch the movie, you'll know what I mean).While the awful - and, crucially, unfunny - Shrek wowed the masses and got labelled one of the best comedies ever made, The Emperor's New Groove, despite glowing reviews, only has something of a cult following, and anyone who didn't ignore it upon its release is glad of it.

You just feel it.  As the final frames come up and the credits start to roll you can just get this visceral invigorating feeling that, without any critique or analysis, that you've just seen something special, maybe even brilliant.  The Emperor's New Groove flipped me out.  It's my pick for the best movie of 2000 and a refreshing change of pace for the Disney folks. But another big achievement is that it's hysterically funny, cool and sophisticated and is still 'G' rated without any of the innuendo and scatological humor the Dreamworks people feel is necessary to get their flicks bumped up to a 'PG' so it will SEEM sophisticated. Kids will like this one, but this is the G-rated movie that teenagers and adults can really laugh at and appreciate. Done with a plot and a style that seems a throwback to the old Loony Toons cartoons, it's fast paced, post-modern, reality bending, weird for the sake of weird humor also calls to mind Monty Python and TV shows like The Simpsons & Family Guy.  That's not to impy it isn't original, in fact it's just as original as those works were. All the while it seems to poke a little fun at itself, which is something you wouldn't normally expect from the proud Disney giant. This is the UNDisney movie.  A break away from annoying sidekicks, melodramatic musical numbers, romantic subplots and preachy morals.  I know tradition says the Beauty and the Beast is the best Disney movie, but looking back, it has the same formula as all the rest.  You can make a much bigger argument that this one is the best if only because it's such a standout.  The plot revolves around a egotistical emperor who is turned into a Llama by an frightening beyond all reason witch who seeks his thrown.  That's it. From this clothesline we are tossed from one wild, almost indescribable sight gag and predicament to the next. Along the way we get oddities like a character talking to himself as the narrator, a guy who speaks squirrel, an anti-hero for a main character and a raging river of death. It builds to a climactic action sequence that is one of the all time funniest, most exciting and imaginative sequences put to animation.  Speaking of, the animation is old fashioned hand drawn with makes a great case for why this style should not go extinct with the rush of computer animation.  The voice performances are perfect.  While I'm not a big fan of his, David Spade is perfectly cast.  John Goodman is given the straight man role for once, but Eartha Kitt is a knockout.  However, Patrick Warburton's Kronc runs away with the movie. His deadpan delivery, jovial laughs and hilarious shoulder angels make him the unlikely star in a movie with no absolutely clear heroes and villains.  But the real star however is Mark Dindel and the writing and directing staff.  Their excellent comic timing and ability to stretch or release gags is to the point where they can tell and age-old joke and find some way to take it to the next level and MAKE it funny.  One of the most interesting things in the already interesting DVD commentary is the part where they express disgust toward the age-old lions, tigers and bears joke.  They say a studio head forced them to put it in but refuse to name names.  This is imaginative talent (something Hollywood sorely needs) on par with the Pixar folk and Disney should let them make more movies like this.  Also, the original score is a dynamo.  But words don't do the justice. A must-see cartoon masterpiece!

John Goodman is in Dan Conner mode (his character from TV's Roseanne) as Pacha, the kind-hearted llama herder.  Eartha Kitt is great as Yzma, and Patrick Warbuton steals the show as Kronk, Yzma's dimwitted henchman. Spade and Goodman are wonderful together, and they make a great buddy team.  And that's essentially what the film is  a buddy film.It should be said that there is no groundbreaking animation or Broadway showtunes in this film.  And you know what?  GREAT!!!  Contrary to what some may believe, there is no Golden Rule that says all movies shalt have those two things in order to be entertaining.  The animation is clean, vibrant and colorful; the opening song performed by Tom Jones is very catchy; and the story WORKS.  But that is just what I was expecting from a movie directed by Mark Dindal, who also directed the wonderful, overlooked Cats Don't Dance.  Dindal injects Groove with the same energy level he did Cats, and the results pop off the screen.If you want groundbreaking animation and Broadway tunes, go put Aladdin back in the VCR.

The animation is spot on, with beautiful backgrounds and well-drawn characters that are also likable. They are also very funny, especially Kronk, who looked similar to Gaston in Beauty and the Beast. The music by John Debney and Sting was hip and memorable. Usually in direct to video sequels(which of course this is not) the songs are just awful, and sound like they were improvised in five minutes. A good example is Cinderella 2. The songs here have funny lyrics, are well sung and sound as though the composers took some extreme lengths to make it perfect. The voice talents are exceptional. David Spade's acting ability is somewhat limited but for this type of character, a selfish emperor called Kuzco who is turned into a llama by his adviser, it works wonderfully. John Goodman was very earnest as Pacha, and the villainess Yzma, who I would pick over the really bland Morgana from the Little Mermaid sequel any day, was played to perfection by Eartha Kitt. The script is funny and touching, and while sometimes it isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as some animated films, it has a huge impact on the well told story. I have no real criticism for this movie, other than it is probably too short. Anyway 9/10. Bethany Cox.

My impression is that there are many who wished that the Empire of the Sun version were made instead, desiring a more deep and meaningful or artistic movie, but for many, having only seen a few of what appear to be foreboding and dark themed cels, we are glad that it evolved into ENG instead. It is disappointing that Disney feels that it should shun this movie, in word and deed. Considering some of the junk that Disney had put out in the same time frame, the lack of available merchandising or exposure only serves to accent Disney's inexplicable self-directed sense of failure for this film.

I've always thought (as many other people) that a great children movie is a movie for everybody, and this is the case. This film has every quality to be considered not just a cartoon, but an excellent comedy.This is my favorite Disney movie, mainly because it is so atypical for Disney. First of all, there aren't only stereotypical bad guys and good guys, you can see all degrees of good and bad. Also, you can see that people (or llamas ) ) are able to change. Secondly, there's irony, a characteristic not very common to be depicted in a children movie. There's even a very subtle sexual undertone in some scenes (Yzma changing assistants for younger ones; Yzma lifting her skirt), subtle enough not to disturb children but to amuse grown-ups. Thirdly, there are plenty of details and gags! In this sense, it reminds of old classical movies and series, always with a twist. But the most important thing is absurd I saw this film lots of times and I keep finding out-of-place, out-of-time elements that make the setting unique and funny in itself (that reminded me a lot of Top secret!). You can laugh for hours just by noting these little things.The characters are round and quite complex, as I said before. It is also refreshing to see a movie about friendship, not romantic as many other previous ones. And I love that tough, clumsy, very guy-ish kind of friendship, without many words or gestures of affection. The plot is simple but rich, with a nice message for kids and a good depiction of the process of change.I'd like to add, for English-speaking readers, that I've watched the movie in Spanish too and it's exactly as enjoyable as the original. The Spanish script and voices were very carefully created, and I always appreciated this feature in those Disney movies I saw in both languages.Basically, and mainly, it's a happy movie, and that's why I love seeing it so often because it makes me happy every time.

Like Kuzco, the man is pompous and arrogant.  In most of his movies he plays a role such as this.  Kuzco is no different.  The character has a mind of his own, and throughout most of the movie the viewer will be surprised and entertained by his comical witticisms and his I'm-So-Much-Better-Than-You wisecracks.We meet Kuzco, King of the World, according to the Theme Song Guy, as he is at the peak of his kingly career.  Just how he loses that career, is transmogrified into a llama, and put at the bottom of the social structure, is hilariously magnificent.  The conflict is ever so funny, and the climax builds to hysterical, uncontrollable laughing.The movie also contains several different subplots, such as Kronk and his two little supernatural friends and Pacha and Kuzco.  The audience is thrown from conflict to conflict, each containing their own hilarious twists.Disney has put together yet another superbly animated film, and dubbed it with a name like no other and enlisted a cast so brilliant that it's hard to find any flaws with this movie.

This movie was top notch Disney and a true modern masterpiece that has more of old Walt's spirit than any of Disney's other so called masterpieces since Aladdin. Only a few critics actually seemed to get it, and even those that praised it still missed the point by actually believing it was all about the comedy. All the rest trivialized it by pointing to a whole bunch of meaningless mistakes. Its emphasis on story rather than tired formula and cliches wasn't seen, and its lack of silly, overblown musical numbers tying up the story was booed, not praised. Its old school animation was mistaken as weak, and its vibrant, original, and colorful characters were written off as unmemorable. None of this could be further from the truth. The Emperor's New Groove was stylish and sassy. It was a breath of fresh air that proved Disney was for once willing to flex their creative muscles and think outside the box. The characters were the most original and most memorable I had ever seen in a Disney movie. Not since the days of Lady and the Tramp had a movie like this come along. The Emperor's New Groove spoke to kids of all ages. It allowed everybody to laugh at it without going over kids' heads. And it spoke to kids without talking down to them, preaching, moralizing, or beating them over the head. The simple message was that selfishness was evil, and the movie brought that across politely through the use of story, without bursting into song. This was a message kids could actually use and learn from. And kudos to Disney for portraying a happy, normal, biologically sound family. No dead parents here, and I know there won't be any squirming kids because this is one of Disney's least violent movies. So kudos to Disney for what this is, a grand animated masterpiece in the tradition of the old school, and for what this isn't, more overstuffed moralizing grandeur following stale formula. And if I were a parent, I for one won't be afraid to let my kid watch this. Anybody else that didn't see this movie's beauty, well that's your opinion, but it's really a shame. I gave this movie a full 10, a score I haven't given an animated movie since Bambi. I would give it an 11 if I could.

The others since have left me cold, so luckily my love for animation was satisfied by the Aardman shorts & Chicken Run, the Pixar trilogy (Bug's Life & Toy Stories) amd Antz. But here, out of the blue with no previews in the movie theaters I frequent, comes this wonderful movie!Once again, Disney has used a classic tale, of a powerful but cruel and self centered individual being thrown into a scary situation with one of his lowliest underlings, and coming out a much improved person for the experience (the examples are many, but A Christmas Carol is a good example of the genre.) In this film, the powerful one is the Emperor (Kuzco - voiced by David Spade) of a Mayan/Aztec type rural kingdom. The underling is the peasant (Pacha - voiced by John Goodman) who herds the Emperor's llamas. The scary situation is the Emperor's scheming advisor (Yzma - voiced by Eartha Kitt), an almost Cruela DeVil type withered and scary old crone who fancies herself as vastly more attractive than she is, and her body building / gourmet cooking / dimwitted- yet- strangely- resourceful boy-toy / chair carrier / bodyguard (Kronk - voiced by Patrick Warburton ...don't know him? he does the voice of Buzz Lightyear in the TV show version of the Toy Story spinoffs...same kind of voice as Tim Allen in the same role.) The neat thing about the voice talent is that the characters are made to look pretty much like the actors (Eartha must have a really good sense of humor!)Anyway, it is no spoiler to say that the Emperor gets turned into a llama (she was trying to kill him with a magic potion, to be administered by Kronk, who screws up the dosage hence the odd result) and the advisor takes over the kingdom. She tasks Kronk with taking the llama out into the country and killing it, but he fails her (similar to the huntsman in Snow White, but funny this time.) When she gets word that the llama is on the loose, not dead, she takes matters into her own hands (Snow White again) and sets off in search of the talking critter with Kronk carrying her chair around with her in it...this makes for lots of funny scenes.Ant that is what this film is about (besides the moral-of-the-story aspect). It is simply a great time for all ages. The colorful scenery and nonstop slapstick is good for the kids, while the constant stream of sight gags, topical references, satire and parody delight the adults. This film has a much wittier script than most Disneys, and get this...it's a cartoon, not a musical. The characters do not sing songs at every drop of a hat. Only the Emperor gets an opening song to tell us what a great guy he thinks he is. This characteristic also sets the film apart from other Disneys.I was interested to see that the credits list very little in the way of computer animation. Also, the work seems to have taken place in Disney's tiny animation facility in their park in Florida (seems that another recent one was made entirely there) instead of in California. There is also a Paris Unit listed, so I wonder if the Disneyland-France has a similar animation facility?This film is a delight, and can easily stand multiple viewings.

Originally titled Emperor in the Sun, the film was going to focus on a selfish emperor who optimistically switched positions with a peasant look-a-like who would later become the target of an evil witch's plan. She was going to summon a dark spirit to block out the sun to prevent her from aging, almost like a retelling of Dorian Gray.The film developed an untold amount of stress for everyone involved. Producer Randy Fullmer was aggravated that production was moving at a snail's pace and was consistently rushing director, at that time, Roger Allers to speed along, offering him no extensions. The project had to be done as fast as possible in order to meet the strict summer 2000 deadline. Out of options, Disney hired the director Mark Dindal, who had worked on the musical Cats Don't Dance, one of the few animated films not to boast the Disney label, and both him and Allers developed very different story lines for the same film, one focusing on comedy (Dindal's) and one heavy drama and morals (Allers).At the end of the day, Fullmer denied Allers an extension and he abandoned the project, leaving all the weight on Dindal's shoulders. The project did not make the summer 2000 deadline, but went on to be released during the wintertime of that same year, something one must applaud considering the treacherous state it was in for so long. What Dindal managed to do to a project that looked to be a lost cause from there on out is truly astonishing, proving that even the dustiest pieces of work can be polished off to look good. The Emperor's New Groove is a delightful film, occupying a concise runtime, unstoppable action scenes, and fierce and interesting characters rarely striking a wrong note.The story focuses on Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), the selfish, manipulating emperor of the Inca Empire. After firing his adviser, Yzma (Kitt), her and her dim-witted assistant Kronk (Patrick Warburton, who also voices Joe Swanson from Family Guy) concoct a scheme to kill the Emperor by making him drink a poisonous potion. During a staged dinner, the potion gets switched and Kuzco is turned into an unattractive llama. Hidden inside the bag of Pacha (Goodman), one of the Emperor's peasants, the two realize they must work together, despite being on opposite ends of the food chain, to try and get Kuzco his position back.It is pretty clear that the he was a selfish man story has been well-played out. It was just six years after this that the Pixar film Cars modified the formula and injected it with a nostalgic rush to put it to use. The story is moved along by its refusal to provide a heavy-handed moral or become bogged down with complications from such a simplistic story. This is a genial exercise in smooth, involving animated filmmaking, moved along by its action and its instantly lovable characters.Also, there is something nice about returning to the wholesomeness of an animated picture from the early 2000's. Ever since the creation of full length CGI pictures, which all started with Toy Story in 1995, it appears hand drawn animation and claymation have been unfortunately pushed to the side, while the easier way is taken out. I love CGI animated features, especially the ones from Pixar, but really, how much of the candy-coated colors and the overly cheery atmosphere can you healthily stomach? The early 2000's animation is one of the few successful hybrids, perfectly blending the simplicity of animation with the digitized color enhanced textures.This is also an elegant reminder to parents and teens who enjoy nostalgia that 3D is a tainted gimmick. Here, the characters pretty much gleefully jump off the screen as if boundaries have been shredded, and they are so lively even without the dim colors or the extra dimension. This is the kind of animated feature Disney should be striving for, and they would be much closer to their competition at Pixar.The Emperor's New Groove is animated slapstick, and functions inside such a rare formula so well. It is elegantly voice acted, expertly animated, and it is nothing but surprising that a picture that one seemed doomed has now gone on to be such a remarkable picture.Voiced by David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Patrick Warburton.

There's a large segment of society that loves the simplicity and innocence of the Disney formula Beautiful visuals, moralistic value-reaffirmation, and escapism. The millions of people that flock to their movies and to their theme parks are craving this type of entertainment.To these people, Emperor's New Groove didn't fit the mold. It was, bluntly, a Looney Tunes/Tom and Jerry/Woody Woodpecker full-length comedy movie dressed up from the outside like a Disney film. The trailers were hacked-up from the movie's previous incarnation as the epic drama Kingdom Of The Sun, so they could be forgiven for not knowing that they would be seeing a 78 minute movie with the same level of entertainment as Wile E. Coyote getting an Anvil dropped on his head, or Daffy Duck being shot until his beak falls off by Elmer Fudd. They left the theaters somewhat justified in their disappointment and dislike of the film.But some of us... those of us that grew up on Television, on Saturday Morning Cartoons, on Fred Flintstone, Yogi Bear, Bugs Bunny, The Road Runner, JabberJaw, The Banana Splits... this was the movie from Disney that we'd all been waiting for. This was FUNNY. Not hmmmm, that was humorous and a good lesson to boot!, but HAW HAW HAW KUZCO GOT A MOUTH FULL OF BEES!!!. Humor for humor's sake. Laughter for laughter's sake. The characters were just that... CHARACTERS. We weren't expected to identify with any of them, we were just expected to laugh at (and with) them.How this movie made it past Disney Corporate in it's final form, I'll never know. I know that Disney had already sunk millions into Kingdom, and wanted to get something, ANYTHING from their investment, and turned to Mark Dindal, who made the criminally underrated Cats Don't Dance. The end result is unlike any other non-Pixar Disney movie ever irreverent, hilarious, engaging.

This movie however,proved me wrong.This movie is about a self-centered,spoiled and seemingly heartless young Emperor named Kuzco.With the snap of his fingers,he can get anything he wants even if it's a summer home.He only worries about himself and his needs and no one's whatsoever.That all might change with Pacha,a generous,thoughtful,and intelligent everyday peasant.He seems like your average peasant with a middle-class family and some farm animals of his own.He and Kuzco have nothing in common and have a bad start(Kuzco demands that Kuzcotopia,his new summerhouse to be built on top of the hill where Pacha and his family live)but they overcome that throughout the story.Yzma,Kuzco's cunning,stubborn and pessimistic adviser was recently fired and she wants revenge.In return,she decides to poison him with a potion with the help of Kronk,her lovable,dim-witted and humorous right-hand man. Unfortunately,he transforms Kuzco into a llama instead and when he tries to get rid of him,Kronk accidentally drops him on Pacha's cart which Pacha brings all the way to his village without knowing that the emperor is actually in a bag on his cart.With Kuzco far from the palace,leaving Yzma to rule the empire and leaving Kuzco and Pacha to triumph over the obstacles to travel to the palace,what will become of the story?Watch it and view good quality comedy with a pinch of drama and be amazed.I believe this movie is a Disney classic.The magic of Disney returned in this enjoyable story.The characters are well-developed and all three dimensional.Kuzco begins as the spoiled brat who can literally get anything that he wants and throughout the story,he learns the value of friendship and generosity.At first when he turns into a llama,the teenage audience want Kuzco to stay as a llama because of his bad attitude yet later in the story,they're rooting for him to transform back into a human.Pacha may not be the best character but there's no one who can hate him.Pacha already has compassion and generosity from his family life and may seem speechless in some scenes but most of that changes when he meets Kuzco.Pacha is also the one who gets him and Kuzco out of sticky situations in the jungle.In most Disney movies,the villains are serious and seemingly boring but this movie changed that Disney law.Yzma was hilarious as an old and ugly woman who is almost as spoiled as Kuzco.She has clever lines and has impatience which is what makes her humorous.However,Kronk deserves most of the credit for the humor.Kronk is the most lovable character in the whole movie.He delivered his humor with enthusiasm.The squirrel scene cracked me up.I'll rate this movie a 7.9/10 for memorable quotes and a deep friendship built.

Lots of times the jokes come in at very fast paces and are sometimes hard to pick up on at first glance.  The plot also gets choppy in places.  And a lot of the humor is aimed at the younger audience, thought not too young, but the grandparents in the audience might get bored or confused by it.  Parents may find them amusing, but the only people I heard laughing the whole time were the teens to 20's.

It did well with most critics and performed sufficiently at the box office. But after seeing it once, I see why this is officially put in the Post-Renaissance period for Disney, which could be argued as a Second Dark Age for Disney at the same time that Pixar was exploding. The animation is nice if not as appealing as Renaissance films, some of the characters can be expected to be likable or the other way around, and it does feature a subtle lesson against selfishness, which still didn't convince me since this is a movie meant for Playhouse Disney (nowadays Disney Junior). I can commend Disney for not going in the crude humor direction like with The Lion King (or Brother Bear and Home on the Range from what I've heard), but none of the jokes were ones that I, a 15 year old, found funny, not even Yzma's attempt at wit (she's supposed to be one of the more comical Disney villains). I boosted its score for attempting to branch out from just preschoolers to second graders, but I would skip this for how comedy aside, it's simply tedious.

I also like to quote this movie out loud often which always makes me laugh, like Hit the road, Bucky! and Is there anything on this menu that is not swimming in gravy?! There's lots of lines that are hilarious, but then others that make me angry like You want to keep me stranded out here FOREVER. and Couldn't see you, why not?! What I liked best about Yzma, this movie's villain, is that not only is she funny and voiced by the late, great, Eartha Kitt, but also she turns into a pretty gray cat during the climactic battle at the Incan palace, that kind of looks like the color of a cat I currently own at my house who is a Russian Blue named Shadow (who is a male cat, BTW). I also like the part where Pacha says Lions, Tigers, Bears and then Yzma says Oh my! in reference to the iconic line from the masterpiece The Wizard of Oz.However, there is something about this comedy that I probably would have liked to see differently, and that's just two elements. The first is that I would have loved this movie a lot if comedian actor Bob Hoskins (Eddie Valiant from Who Framed Roger Rabbit) had voiced Kuzco in this one instead of David Spade, who was not smart by starring in a horrible and lousy film called Grown Ups with Adam Sandler and Kevin James who are terrible actors to me as well.And the other thing wrong here, I'm not a huge fan of the music of the singer Sting from the band The Police (who I actually like as a group band), so while I think the song My Funny Friend and Me is an impressive music idea, I would actually love the song if the well-known pianist and singer Elton John, had wrote that song and sung it instead of Sting (Oh well, what are you going to do?).All in all, though, I would recommend this animated film if you're entertained by most of the cast as I am, or if you're interested in studying about the Incan Empire this takes place during (which is also one of my interests).

It was going to be a more traditional Disney adventure musical. Unfortunately the studio and Allers didn't see eye to eye, and eventually the whole idea was scrubbed and the existing material was turned into a buddy comedy.And as far as saving jobs go, they could have done a lot worse. You can definitely see that they had to cut a lot of corners to get the film out on schedule, but the movie has a lot of style, great sense of humour and very likable characters. It's one of the funniest Disney films I've ever seen - if not THE funniest - and stands out from the rest of the canon.The basic premise is that an Incan emperor named Kuzco gets turned into a llama after he fires his royal adviser, Yzma, who happens to be a sorceress of some talent - aren't they all. And now Kuzco has to get back into his palace in order to turn back into a man. The only problem is that the only man who can help him is also the chief of the village he intends to raze to the ground in order to build a summer home for himself. Not a very complicated plot as far as Disney films go, but it's the comedy that brings people back to this film. And that works beautifully. All four of the main characters have very good voice actors and they all have great chemistry together. The film also takes full advantage of its animated nature, giving us some really imaginative scenarios and gags.The only real problem I have is that the plot is very predictable and that the animation, while working very well in terms of comedic value, does look kind of cheap by Disney standards. Plus, while I enjoy the fact that Kuzco starts out very unorthodox for a Disney lead, his eventual character development is about as clichéd as you can get.Still, I do like the film a lot and it's an easy recommendation for anyone that enjoys Disney and for anyone that appreciates light-hearted comedies.

It's full of heart this movie but also importantly fun too, sure Kuzco and David Spade who voices him can get annoying but it's really the other characters in this movie you have to love. This is one of the best received Disney films of the early 2000's and no wonder why, it's unique and feels fresh amongst the crowd of Disney made animations.The film goes along at a nice pace, not too fast but not too slow and for it's running time of only 78 minutes, it manages to get in everything it needs. Kuzco as mentioned is our main man and his adventure is pretty fun, add in the stupidly funny character of Kronk(Patrick Warburton), the power mad Yzma(Eartha Kitt) and the humblest of them all, peasant Pacha(John Goodman) and you have yourself one hell of a story. It starts and ends very nicely and could possibly get better and better as it goes on, just good fun and not just for the kids either.I loved the design and animated location of this movie, set in the old style kingdoms of Incan times it just bursts with colour and contains beautifully created sets and really can at times make you admire it. I think it was a gamble for Disney to go with what they went with though, luckily the story is interesting because if not, the film would be all show and no actual heart to it, but this movie has both in abundance. I said about Kuzco being kind of annoying and I do find David Spade a kind of, little annoyance in this movie, the only member of the cast I disliked really. Although I say what I say, Spade is still not bad and it would be too mean of me to criticise how he sounds, it's Kuzco himself who is big headed but I do think where he lies best is when he is in scenes with Pacha and John Goodman's booming but also kind of calm voice. You'll come to like certain characters but for me Kronk is by far the highlight, very dumb but hilarious and because of it he provides the majority if not nearly all laughs, a well placed move from Disney.Mark Dindal directs OK and David Reynolds writes at the same level, Dindal works best in the more action packed moments full of running and swinging and the such where as Reynolds only really works well in the funniest of moments and especially with good old Kronk. I felt this movie had a surprising amount of depth to it, even at times powerful emotion, Pacha the kind peasant is a beautifully created character and provides the complete opposite kind of outlook than that of Kuzco, again a well played move from the people behind this but also that this film is more than comedy. I think the Emperors New Groove is a fine movie and one I couldn't recommend more, and that's to adults and children as this movie is not so childish and actually can be funny. Sweet short and a lovely little tale, this is one film I can see many who haven't already seen it liking and maybe who knows, loving it.

Certainly not the most ambitious or sophisticated of animated films, TENG is a light heated buddy comedy which runs on comic gags and energetic jokes. In terms of entertainment level it hits the mark. The animation looks good and visually the film works well, but what makes it work is the humour. The film often resembles an automatic joke dispenser as the inventive, witty and biting gags never stop flowing and the film maintains a very good pace throughout. 90 minutes was definitely the right length for the movie and it manages not to run out of steam. Another fun thing about the film is how it is timeless since it's set in the past but features many modern elements. The script oozes with laughs and is amusingly meta, with the emperor providing some amusing narration throughout the film.There are problems with TENG though. The buddy relationship at the centre of the film is cliché, predictable and rushed, while the emperor himself is a pretty unlikable character. There are dips here and there, the consistently zany and funny atmosphere means tension falls by the wayside. Ultimately, this is never more than light entertainment although that isn't ultimately a problem even if it means you're unlikely to remember the film as much as some other Disney movies. With it's entertainingly over the top set pieces and fittingly silly tone, this will entertain many kids and some but not all of the adults. Disney just strip the story down to the comedy and entertainment here and it mostly works. An entertaining movie for the whole family to watch together, TENG hits the comedy notes with skill and is a good time.

Soon the llama is in the forest with his only help coming from Pacha, a man was told by the Emperor that his home was going to be destroyed for a new resort.If you're coming to this Disney movie expecting one of their classics then you're going to walk away disappointed. Disney has built up such a strong reputation and have delivered so many terrific films that whenever they release just a good one, it's hard for that film to really stand out. That's pretty much what happened to THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE because it's a nice little time-killer but at the same time it's certainly not one of the studios best movies.There are a few issues here but the biggest is that there's just nothing here that really stands out or becomes classics. Everything here is good but nothing is great if you will. I think the weakest aspect is the story itself because it's just a bit too predictable for its own good as you know what's going to end up happening in the end. With that said, the majority of the characters are extremely likable with Pacha (voiced by John Goodman) and Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton) really standing out. The evil Yzma makes for a good villain but it's hard to love to hate her because the Emperor himself is so annoying and ugly that you really can't hate or dislike the villain for trying to knock him off.The film, as you'd expect, features some terrific animation and there's no doubt that the music score is a winner too. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE isn't a masterpiece but as long as you don't go into the film expecting one you should find this to be a decent time-killer.

Shrek has its Lord Faarquad, Toy Story 2 has Buzz's wings ejecting, and The Emperor's New Groove has...well, a llama voiced by David Spade strutting around being David Spade. Maybe this isn't one of those.But it would be unfair to judge a kid's film on its appeal to adults. The story is still fun, there are a smattering of jokes (definitely ones that will appeal to kids - talking animals, slapstick and goofy Kronk being goofy), and is full of colour. The film's highlights include the voice acting of Patrick Warburton and John Goodman (both voice-acting staples) and also Eartha Kitt's villain, who is memorable even though she could easily pass for Cruella de Ville. Towards the end of the film, there are a couple of fourth wall breaks that make for a good chuckle as well.As for flaws, well Kuzco undergoes a remarkable transformation in a remarkably short and convenient amount of time. David Spade is neurotic and I cannot bear him, even just as a voice actor I know he's there. And ultimately, Emperor's New Groove can't help but feel like a shallow Disney effort.Its still an easy, fun watch, but its a more inferior Disney film and you'll get far more enjoyment from watching the superior aforementioned Shrek and Toy Story 2.

It is a very smart and unexpected turn from Disney, every time I watch it I just can't believe they ever allowed it be made, it's constant use of breaking the fourth wall and adult innuendos surprise me each time. The use of breaking the fourth wall is definitely my favourite part of the movie and is what makes it so fun and unique, it is mostly done by the main character Kuzco, who questions the films premise constantly and pauses it throughout because he is confused whenever he isn't on the screen, this type of thing can be annoying at times in movies, but it works out perfectly here and I never got annoyed. All the characters in this movie are great and likable in their own way, my favourite is Kronk, every line of dialogue by him is memorable and he had me in stitches most of the time. Very funny, smart and a huge risk from Disney that worked out well, the Emperor's New Groove is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a film for the whole family to enjoy. After a king is transformed in to a llama by an evil woman looking to take his place on the throne, he must get the help of a friendly village man in order to turn back to normal.

But not many are funny nonstop. That's where The Emperor's New Groove checks in.This madcap adventure follows the bratty Incan emperor Kuzco (voiced perfectly by David Spade) after he fires his long-time adviser, Yzma (Eartha Kitt's crowning achievement). With the help of her ridiculously stupid henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton aka David Puddy), Yzma plots to kill Kuzco and take over the kingdom.Meanwhile, kindly peasant Pacha (John Goodman) has learned that Kuzco is about to destroy his village to make room for the royal summer home.Groove is Disney's sassiest, funniest animated feature to date, building upon the foundation laid by the Genie in Aladdin and the overall tone of Hercules to perfect the comic blueprint.This is the only Disney movie I've watched over 20 times. Trust me, it's that good. You won't regret trying this oddball, inventive film out. It breaks the fourth wall and importantly doesn't have any romance or cheesy songs. At only 67 minutes, it's also one of Disney's shortest. But it's quite economical with those minutes.Highly recommended, for all ages!

I don't hear many people talk about it, and it didn't gross as much money as the earlier movies did. Why? I don't get it! This movie is a gem! You wouldn't expect a movie like this from Disney, but maybe that's part of the reason it's good!ANIMATION I enjoy how it looks here. First of all, this doesn't look like the films we had just seen from Disney a decade ago. Unlike Hercules, though, where the animation didn't look very good, here it contributes to the tone of the movie. The movements are fast, so as to compliment the comedic moments and expressions. I guess my only complaint about the animation is Kronk and Pacha look very much alike. Their clothes help us tell one from the other, but their designs look nearly identical.SONGS/MUSIC The theme song was cool, I guess...Uh, yeah. Next.ROMANCE ...A Disney movie without a romance?! Really? The film even set up a scenario for a romance in the beginning. He's presented young women who he can take as a wife, and the film doesn't move forward with it. We never see it again. Wow, that's rare...CHARACTERS Here we go! These characters make this film! I cannot think of a character I don't like. Pacha isn't as entertaining as the rest, but his kindness and pleasantness are enjoyed in comparison to the other main characters who aren't as kind or pleasant. Kuzco is rude and pompous, but he's the type of rude and pompous that's enjoyable. I like watching him. He's funny and entertaining, but he still has a story arc in which he realizes the error of his ways. Of course we all love Yzma and Kronk! These guys are some awesome villains! I know almost nothing they plan ever works, but you don't really want their plans to work because you have such a good time laughing at them! They are a fantastic duo! They work so well together! Pacha's kids can be a little annoying, but I like them overall, and I enjoy the wife too...Dude, did you hear her snort when Pacha got back home? That was funny!STORY The story is OK, I suppose. When you really analyze it, it's like any other Disney movie or buddy comedy two people who don't like each other have to take this voyage together as a villain is causing chaos; the two learn something about each other, a misunderstanding takes place that drives the two away from each other, they come back together, they stop the villain, and they live awesomely. It's not that special, but, like I said, what really drives it are the characters and the jokes. If it weren't for them, this would easily be a dull movie.CONCLUSION This movie is amazing; I don't think I've seen a Disney movie that was fantastic solely because of the characters. The jokes are hilarious, the animation is impressive, and, again, the characters are fan-frickin-tastic! If you haven't seen it, check it out! You'll love it! God bless you. BOOYIKA!

I dig this flick's sense of humor, and the animation is top-notch (you don't see Incan architecture every day, and the animators do it justice).But it's Patrick Warburton who handily walks away with the entire thing, and it's one of my favorite Warburton performances (outside of The Tick).

A satirical cautionary tale, it possibly remains one of the company's most underrated efforts.Having had a turbulent production, it's interesting to see that the 'Emperor' which finally saw the light of day is a witty, almost cruel antithesis to all the positivity associated with the Mouse House. There are several times when the film jars so much with the Disney philosophy that it feels like it doesn't belong in an animated canon of classics including such beloved, whimsical features as 'Snow White' and 'The Lion King'. But this isn't to detract from what is a hilarious, still (somehow) family friendly feature; it's just that it is worth pondering what led to the version of 'The Emperor's New Groove' that saw release at the start of a near ten year period where the studio's successive releases rapidly declined in quality and relevance to the Disney ethos.As hard as it is to believe, John Goodman lent his voice talent to Disney long before he played Sulley in 'Monsters, Inc', which is an excellent reminder of how this film was so quickly, and so easily, forgotten. What's most notable is the satire - the film is saturated with it - would soon be popularised by the likes of 'Shrek' as other animation studios emerged.While a viewing for parental guidance purposes beforehand shouldn't be scoffed at, 'The Emperor's New Groove' is, by large, wholesome family entertainment, just not in the same vein as the Disney you may be familiar with.

At first appearances it didn't look or sound too good either truth be told. A weird title, David Spade in a Disney animation? offbeat looking animation and a wacky spoof-like approach, not exactly the stuffy classical Disney you'd expect.So yes this is a bold move away from the traditional cuddly Disney we all know of. The first thing you notice is the lack of musical numbers (thank God!), there are none I do believe, none whatsoever, and its quite refreshing giving more time for fun and story. The other thing that hits you is the change in pace animation and artistic style wise, no more Disney eyes folks. This film has a very vibrant zany blend of styles which sees a bit of old style Disney in characters, countryside and native dwellings, mixed with some cool straight symmetrically geometric shaped artwork for the royal Peruvian temples within the royal city. The visuals are glorious as usual with the Peruvian countryside and jungles looking lush and green with rolling hills, deep valleys and blue waters. On the flip side the royal palaces and temples are adorned with beautiful symmetric carvings in the walls, massive angular sculptures and lots of uniform guards. The palace tends to be more golds reds and yellows at first but when 'Yzma' takes over everything goes purple and blue. I especially liked the neon flurry of purples, pinks and blues down in the laboratory, that was a bizarre inclusion out of the blue (no pun intended).As said I couldn't see satirical smartass David Spade in a Disney animation, not by a long shot, but blow me down he actually does a good job with his whiny voice. He is perfect as the spoilt Emperor 'Kuzco' (word play on Cusco in Peru) and actually fits the llama character even better. All the main voice actors in the main roles are really good actually, my favourite easily being Warburton as 'Kronk', that guys voice is just funny...it just is!, his character is brilliantly matched to him also. Same can be said for Kitt as Yzma who was clearly designed around her. Believe it or not but there are only four main characters in the entire film! yep just four, but you don't even notice it.The film is pretty quick to the chase really, not overly long and not overly complicated, but it is quite original in a way. The action can be crazy and over the top feeling more like a weekend cartoon rather than an uncle Walt flick but its thoroughly enjoyable at every turn. My only quibble would be the fact it feels stretched out quite badly, the plot clearly isn't enough to cover a proper run time and you can tell. The whole film could of ended after about 30mins really, both of the two main characters never really feel as if they're that far from the royal city/palace. Oh and 'Pacha's' sweet adoring family make you wanna gag...but that's about it.Certainly a shocker this one, didn't think it would be any good and yet it turns out to be one of the best Disney adventures I've seen for a long long time. The colourful visuals, quirky unconventional (for Disney) artistic style, brisk pace and amusing llama characterisation by Spade are all winners in my book, plus there isn't too much schmaltz. But boy you better believe by the end Kuzco has learnt his lesson in humility and how to be a nice guy and not just thinking about himself all the time. Yeah there's always a good moral in every Disney flick, can't escape em.8/10 "},{"Title":"Instant classic","Date":"4 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" When I saw the trailer on the VHS tapes for other Disney movies I was a bit skeptical.

Each one of these actors gives their characters depth and successfully brings them to life.

Of course, we get David Spade's sarcasm and wit. Patrick Warburton keeps audiences laughing in delight as he plays the no brains - all brawn henchman of Yzma named Kronk. It also helps that the movie isn't a musical. There's some musical numbers, but the character's don't stop dead in their tracks and start bellowing out a song every five minutes like many of the classic Disney films.The Emperor's New Groove is a great tool to help teach children the importance of thinking about how your actions affect others.

He then tells Pacha that he must soon move out of his house and make way for Kuzco's new water park. Devastated Pacha soon returns home. Later that night the antagonist of the story Yzma voiced by Earth Kitt, invites Kuzco to dinner as a gesture of no hard feelings for firing her. Their plan however is to poison him, but Kronk voiced by Patrick Warburton grabs the wrong potion changing Kuzco from a human to a llama, and so the adventure begins. This is a great leap from modern day family films in which it chooses a lesser known piece of history dealing with the Mayans and Aztec people. Its a humorous storyline mixed with bits and pieces of action. The cast of characters are great and you also get a feel for them as the plot progresses. Kuzco and Pacha then become the two protagonist as they must put aside their differences and work together to get back to the palace.

With a rather strange, yet still strangely beautiful, style and no big musical numbers save one from the theme guy this feels more like a Pixar film mixed with some Loony Tunes which is no bad thing.The story revolves around the selfish Emperor Kuzco (voiced in a wonderfully amusing whiny manner by David Spade), a happy-go-lucky, carefree chap unphased by anything until he is turned into a llama by the adviser he fired (Yzma, voiced by Eartha Kitt). Once he realises the situation he has to enlist the help of Pacha (John Goodman) to get him back to his palace and make things right. Unfortunately, Pacha is one person who is in no hurry to see the emperor return thanks to Kuzco's selfish plans for Pacha's village that will lead to major upset and upheaval.Sounding a bit off the wall? You have no idea. This movie does it all. There are a succession of great verbal and visual gags, a number of lesser characters given moments to shine (including Pacha's family, a chatty squirrel and, of course, Yzma's assistant Kronk who is voiced by the excellent Patrick Warburton) and a constant sense of barely restrained anarchy. The fourth wall is broken, voiceovers are interrupted and even camera moves are criticised when things stray too far from the focus of the proceedings. All in all, it's fantastic fun. Director Mark Dindal proved, with this and Chicken Little, that he has a knack for making animated comedies that can please every audience member, regardless of age, and I hope he gives us even more great entertainment in future.See this if you like Chicken Little, The Incredibles, The Emperor's New Groove 2 Kronk's New Groove.

By the time the studio neared their heyday (before they start turning real bad), Disney made this hilarious and fast-aced adventure comedy and even took time to parody their own works. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is not the best Disney movie, and maybe not even for a long time, but that's alright. It's funny, energetic, colorful and, in some spots, it's actually clever. What more could I ask for? I guess, nothing more. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE may have not brought out the best Disney can offer, but it still clearly shows their capabilities.One of the best pleasures of GROOVE is the ensemble comedic voice acting. The voice cast, which includes David Spade, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton and John Goodman to list the names at the top-billing, are excellent and never lacking in joy and sharp comedic timing. Their comedic performances are more than enough to sustain adult attention, but not without letting the young 'uns down. If you don't find even one of their hilarious mischief at least amusing then you must have your funny bone ripped out of you body and the pain is excruciating. the entire film may not have been a comedic gold mine, but it comes close to rival any non-animated movie above a G-rating. In fact, I say it might put a few others to shame.Spade lends his outrageous voice talents to the spoiled Emperor Kuzco, who is used to his life of royalty (in Kuzco's term, Everyone is under my command) since birth (in one hilarious scene, Baby Kuzco accidentally beheads his stuffed toy and soon a large number of hands reach out to him, each with a stuffed toy to give away). See, Kuzco wants to destroy a peasant village set upon a scenic hilltop so he can build his summer getaway home (Complete with water slide!). Despite the lead peasant Pacha's (voiced by John Goodman) attempt to halt construction, Kuzco does get everything he wants, right? So he thinks. After being fired by spoiled brat of an emperor, his loyal adviser Yzma (voiced with great presence by Eartha Kitt), which I may describe as a cross between Cruella DeVille and... well, Eartha Kitt, wants to get even with him. While hitting stone head replicas of him doesn't satisfy, Yzma plots instead to poison the emperor. But her plans failed, mainly due to the complete incompetence of her bumbling right-hand man Kronk (the hilarious Patrick Warburton lends his voice). Instead of a dead emperor, they just have one badly turned into a talking llama. Assisted by Pacha, Kuzco (the llama) tries to get back to the palace and change him back to human.True, some jokes falter and the story isn't first-class Disney story-telling, but I wasn't exactly looking for a smart straightforward Disney effort when the first frame appears before my face. The movie had me from the first frame and again, and again, and again later on. One of the main reasons this movie worked for me was that it packs one frame after another with enough juice to make us wait for the other. The movie is one funny moment followed by another, that's both for the young and old audiences. While kids will enjoy the silly humor and energy-packed madness, adults will find the talented voice cast and the smarter humor a real pleasure. Either way, THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE delivers what's coming to you.Rating ***1/2 out of 5.

Few films, particularly family films, in the past few years have come off as funny to me as The Emperor's New Groove. Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade, excellent) is a selfish ruler turned into a llama by a former employee after firing her. That's a funny enough concept on its own, but its simply the over-the-top, ridiculous characters that make this as hilarious as it is. Kuzco's overly selfish nature, such as him scribbling out characters on the screen so we can focus on him, is simply hilarious. Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her assistant Kronk, simply hysterical as a childlike supporting character that steals every scene he is in, are both great. There are just too many laughs in this film to describe in a review, and not a single one of them deserves to be spoiled here. I'll just tell you to see it now. Your whole family can enjoy it and laugh and laugh. Not quite perfect, because of a few annoying scenes, particularly with Pacha's (John Goodman) kids and a few poor attempts at humor here. Despite that, it's a very, very funny movie. One of Disney's best, and simply one of the most hilarious films I have ever watched.***1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"Great one","Date":"20 June 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" Originally developed as an epic called Kingdom of the Sun, The Emperor's New Groove lost scale and most of Sting's song score (some of which can be heard on the soundtrack) on its way to the screen. The end result is the lightest Disney film in many a moon, a joyous romp akin to Aladdin in its quotient of laughs for kids and adults. The original story centers on the spoiled teenage emperor Kuzco (David Spade), who enjoys getting the best of his Aztecan subjects. When he fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his evil sorceress, she seeks revenge and turns Kuzco into a llama with the help of her hunk of the month, a Link named Kronk (Patrick Warburton). Alone in the jungle, the talking llama is befriended by Pacha (John Goodman), who has just been told to vacate his pastoral home by the human Kuzco. What's an ego to do? That's pretty much the story and the characters--simple, direct, fun--a Disney film on a diet. For any fan of the acidic humor of Spade, this is essential viewing. As narrator of his tale, Kuzco uses a sarcastic tone to keep the story jumping with plenty of fun asides (he even stops the film at one point to make sure you know the story is about him). Even better is character actor Warburton (Elaine's stuck-up boyfriend on Seinfeld), who steals every scene as the dim-witted, but oh-so-likable Kronk. There's even a delicious Tom Jones number that starts the film off with a bang.

It never ceases to hold their attention. My kids still, after all this time, laugh out loud (and for good reason). The writing is great and they are never talked down to once.The emperor (Kuzko) is spoiled and self-centered. Through the course of the movie he learns some great lessons about friendship, honesty, and doing the right thing and is ultimately transformed.Yes, there are some adult themes. Murder, for example. Unlike The Lion King where this is handled rather in-your-face and darkly, the makers of this movie glide over this deftly and with a lot of humor. After all, Elmer Fudd was trying to kill Bugs Bunny, right? It is very much in this style and tradition, from dialogue to animation to music.As for me, I love this movie. The children in the movie (Pacha's children) aren't victims as they are in many Disney films; they're not stupid, defenseless or in some kind of peril. They are smart, funny, and resourceful. Kuzko and Pacha are great together, but it is Yzma and Kronk that steal the show. I submit to you that these may be the funniest Disney villains of all time.Another thing I like, that is out of character for Disney, is that this movie isn't trying to sell my children a Kuzko doll. There is very little marketing value to this movie; it's simply left to stand on its own, seemingly produced for no other purpose than to entertain.Why only 9 stars out of 10? The movie closes w/a song performed by Sting (My Funny Friend and Me). The song is fine, but could not be farther out of context with the movie if they had chosen to play the Oscar Meyer wiener song. I'm at a complete loss as to why, after this fast-paced fun movie, they would want to transport the viewer immediately to an elevator or highbrow coffee shop. Kind of strange. "}{"Title":"Disney's are showing some groove","Date":"28 August 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The Emperor's New Groove is an unusual Disney feature, but that's the refreshing thing about it. Originally (for those who didn't knew) it was planned to be a epic drama, with Roger Allers (Lion King) as the director. That were one of the reasons that I looked forward too The emperor's new Groove, who was originally called Kingdom of the sun. But then the project took another direction, with it's understandable in some ways (and it's a looong story, trust me). If they made the right decision is another discussion for now, but when you see The Emperor's New Groove, you can't be disappointed.This film is more bizarre than you expect from Disney. It's not a typical Disney feature like for example Cinderella and Tarzan, but it still is a fresh and enjoyable cartoon. It has more irony and sarcasm and it's nice to see a Disney cartoon that is pure comedy. While the plot is simple, the script is well-written and hilarious. The score from John Debney is most of the time boisterous, but it actually fits the tone of the movie.The characters are likable/hate-able (here comes something that could be considered as a spoiler) Kuzco and Yzma are both the same kind; self-pity, but still funny. Kronk is one of the funniest characters in the film, the same with the squirrel and Pacha's kids. Pacha's wife is very cute and charming. While Pacha himself is not so funny like the rest of the cast, he's a nice and gentle character that is likable. SPOILERS over. Besides, the voice actors are doing a great job!The animation it self looks more than a Warner Bros cartoon than the regular Disney-style, but it fits the movie. The Emperor's New Groove is a Disney-feature that you can safely watch many times without getting easily sick of it. Groove on! He he.

So because some other full-length Disney films such as LILO AND STITCH and THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE are a bit of a let-down isn't a bad thing nor does it mean they are bad films--it's just that these other films are so perfect that you can't help but make comparisons. Fortunately, the intended audience for this film (kids) don't usually make this comparison and I was just happy that the movie didn't make the history teacher within me scream like it did when I saw POCAHONTAS! The movie is about a selfish Incan leader. While anachronisms and historical inaccuracies might have been a problem, Disney wisely made the time period very vague and it's pure fantasy. Sure, witches like the one played by Eartha Kitt did not exist in ancient Peru, but it was obvious to everyone watching that this was not meant to be a history lesson--just silly fun with a decent central message. Just sit back and enjoy this cute little time-passer. "},{"Title":"Finally! Disney embraces the concept of fun","Date":"30 January 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I'm in that minority that doesn't really enjoy Disney films. I personally think Disney is a dying studio. Its time has long since passed, and now it should make room for other companies. What does it say about Disney when they paid a massive cash settlement to Pixar, a studio renowned for their excellent work, just to get them to stay with them? Disney knows its days are numbered, and are forced to persuade Pixar, their only real source of income, to remain even though Pixar has the creative strength to flex its muscles and stand on its own two feet.Also I think Disney films have grown too sombre and lifeless, and must resort to false sentimentality to provide easy answers. So it was refreshing to come across a film like The Emperor's New Groove. A film that is sufficiently knowing, bouncy, and overall, just plain fun. Its no classic. Disney have produced some good films in the past like Snow White and Beauty and the Beast. And TENG is not on their level. But it is tremendously entertaining. Not to mention imaginative. As well as the fact its got the snappiest music since The Jungle Book.The Emperor's New Groove's storyline is basic, but surprisingly gets a lot of mileage out of its central conceit. Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) is an extremely shallow leader. He even has his own theme song! He thinks nothing of firing his advisers at the drop of a hat. Or bulldozing other people's properties to make way for swimming pools.His chief adviser Yzma (voiced superbly by Eartha Kitt) is one of these plotting opportunists who want to grab power for themselves (they crop up frequently in Disney films!). When Kuzco gets rid of her because she's too old for his tastes, she hatches a plan with her lackey Kronk to poison him. But a mix up in potions leads to Kuzco being turned into a llama. Forced to fend for himself in the jungle, and with the aid of a gentle llama herder Pacha (John Goodman), Kuzco must return to the castle and find the potion that will turn him back into a human, while avoiding Yzma's attempts to finish him off once and for all.TENG is certainly not an ambitious film. There are no world domination schemes or enchanted princesses and heart wrenching love stories. Everything about the film is simply played for knockabout laughs. And what's wrong with that? David Spade plays Kuzco likably. Throwing out dry insults and wry observations, he even injects some sympathy for his situation as well. The animation is not on the par of Aladdin or The Lion King. In fact there is something almost deliberately 2D to the way the film looks. Almost like a throwback to classic animation. But not earlier Disney efforts. More like the animated shorts of Warner Bros/Looney Tunes cartoons.That may be the reason why I like the film so much. I'm a huge fan of Chuck Jones cartoons. Their eye-popping visual lunacy made for great fun rides. And the same type of energy suffuses The Emperor's New Groove. There are set-pieces that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Road Runner cartoon. There's an hilarious scene when Kuzco and Pacha are wedged back to back between a cliff, and climb up with their feet while being menaced by crocodiles, scorpions and bats all at the same time.A great deal of imagination has gone into the comedy. There's a wonderful slapstick lunacy to it all at times. Even screwball comedy. I love the scene when Kuzco and Yzma are both in an Aztec diner. They both enter and exit the kitchen almost instantaneously, missing each other by seconds. It reminded me of a classic episode of Frasier, called The Innkeepers which had a similar situation in a restaurant.There are even moments of meta-fiction, and breaking down the fourth wall. Kuzco sometimes stops the film when he becomes concerned the action is shifting from him. Or when Kronk deconstructs a chase sequence with diagrams, concerning how Yzma caught up to Kuzco somehow. Even though it makes no logical sense. Deliriously screwball humour, like Kuzco the narrator arguing with Kuzco the character. And a manic number of transformations as Kuzco tries out different potions to get back to normal.The cast really is excellent and gives the film a lot of life. As well as Spade, John Goodman invests a great deal of likability into Pacha's character. Eartha Kitt is superb. A nice change that the villain of the piece is not unspeakably evil. Just vain and witty instead. She plays the part of the bitch well. And her comeuppance is wonderful! Patrick Wharbuton's a scene stealer as Kronk. I love his crises of conscience, where his good and bad sides argue with each other. The only complaint with his character was he should have ended up as a chef now that Yzma's out of the picture. Instead he becomes a boy scout leader. A chef would have been more in character.But overall, The Emperor's New Groove is great fun. I really laughed out loud several times throughout. And that's what animation is all about. It even manages to be thoughtful at times without hammering its message home like most Disney films. Highly recommended!

Well, there are multiple answers, but if there is one film that fits this description, it's The Emperor's New Groove. With stellar voice work, pacing that is faster than most films within the past decade, and also containing a dose of silliness that just doesn't happen in enough films, this Disney animated flick stands as the best amongst the animated Disney films (excluding Pixar) within the past three decades and easily the most underrated. While we see Stitch everywhere, the furious campaign behind Chicken Little, and the attempt to make a worldwide smash out of Dinosaur, Disney seemed to have little support towards this little flick. Nonetheless, this is the little film that could; as it defied lower-budgeted animation, defied a song listing, and delivered some of the funniest moments and one-liners in animated history. It also managed to destroy the long-running Seinfeld curse, as it made Patrick Warburton a solidified voice-acting star. Most amazing, David Spade was actually quite funny without the assistance of Chris Farley. The Emperor's New Groove follows a bratty prince by the name of Kuzco (David Spade) that lives without a care in the world as everyone caters to his every whim without question. When he fires his adviser though, things get interesting as Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her dumb yet reliable assistant Kronk attempt to kill him, only to instead turn him into a llama. After the mishap, Kuzko needs to actually rely on someone other than himself (Pancha, voiced by John Goodman) to regain his position at the throne and stop Yzma. Easier said than done, as Kuzco must change his ways in order to succeed. Lilo and Stitch is not the black sheep of Disney films like advertised, its this one. With only one song, lack of detailed animation, total rundown of the fourth wall, and also a defiance of a plot without its holes, The Emperor's New Groove relies on quick, witty humor and its lively animation to keep the kids and adults entertained. To add to that, this is the first Disney film in ages to contain some true character development, as we see Kuzco slowly rise from a selfish brat into a likable character as he spends more time becoming a llama. Partly written and directed by Mark Dindal, his fast-paced animation and action techniques were perfected here after the underrated flop Cats Don't Dance years before. The voice acting is what carries this film from decent to beyond superb. From the zany and quick-witted David Spade, to the veteran John Goodman, to the funny and lively talents of Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton, those four ran the film with excellent one-liners, funny moments, and a chemistry that is very rare amongst animated films. Easily some of the best voice work in any animated film, as long as one of the four was at the screen talking, the laughs would just continue rolling in. We even have the late veteran John Fiedler lending his voice in a hysterical cameo. Easily quotable movie, and that is always a plus. One can say that this has a sort of Frat Pack comedic-like quality to it, as it doesn't rely on a deep story with morals, but instead on humorous situations and quirky lines to convince the viewer to watch again and again. Bottom Line Among the best non-Pixar animated films within the past two decades, Emperor's New Groove is a fresh new look at the way Disney films are made. No longer do we have a romance story, no longer do we have a Disney princess in distress, we have a great cast of lovable characters in an environment that even gets the viewers involved. With a zany plot, clever one-liners, a lot of visual humor and a running time that never actually drags, there is really nothing really wrong with this movie. David Spade's last funny movie, the destruction of the Senfeld curse, and also the revival of Eartha Kitt's career can be found here. Watch it, no matter how old you are and what kinds of films you enjoy. Anyone that doesn't get a kick out of this one just doesn't have a sense of humor. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Emporer changed to llama, wants to change back to human.","Date":"7 December 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" This movie is a very good for families.

By that I don't mean that the *premise* is clever (which it nevertheless is), but the script writing, the turn of a phrase. . . shoot, the USE of a phrase here and there, it's really funny. I chalk this up to allowing the characters to BE characters instead of caricatures of characters.The actors and actresses timing is *perfect* and even when the whole thing gets silly (which it does, in a good way), the characterizations hold-up.As I write this, years after the movie's release, my kids and I can (and do) still occasionally find reasons to quote some of the lines.This is one of those go-to movies when everyone's bored and you just need something fun to watch. It doesn't get ultra-sappy, it won't make you laugh until you cry, nobody has to fall in love with anyone and nobody has to die a horrible, unjust death.

It's not a musical like most Disney cartoons before it, which makes it much easier to take in (since you don't have to worry about those cringe moments that happen so often in other Disney musicals). The writing was great, but what really made it better than great was the voice acting. I can full-heartedly say that this movie had the best voice cast I've ever seen come out of Disney. Eartha Kitt, John Goodman, David Spade, and (my personal favourite character in the film) Patrick Warburton all created terrific characters. The animation was very original - a style I hadn't seen yet in a Disney cartoon. The plot as a whole was probably the weakest part of the film, but its simplicity is part of what makes everything else that's so great about the movie stand out. Watching it over and over again, I keep finding new lines of dialogue that I'm happy to quote (especially from Kronk, who, as I said, was my favourite character). What makes the movie truly great, however, is that it never stops being entertaining. There are only a couple very brief Disney moments - by which I mean those moments that attempt to evoke some serious emotion - but they're short enough to avoid requiring the viewer to cringe, and still manage to entertain thanks to what usually ends up being a cleverly-written line at the end of it. This is one of only two Disney-made movies that have earned my 10/10, and it earned it because it never ceased to entertain me.

Disney was shattered by how Fantasia/2000 performed and not pleased with the critical reception Dinosaur received (being one of their worst films).Throughout the 90s, the Disney films were a return to form, but they also pandered to children, something Walt Disney was against. Dinosaur was pandering at its worst, but The Emperor's New Groove is a breath of fresh air compared to the 90s Disney films. Most of the 90s Disney films are great, but this film is near-perfect.The Emperor's New Groove is a funny, joyous adventure that doesn't try to be anything it's not. It went through a lot in its early stages, and it finally turned out to be step away from the big Disney musicals. The film has an odd plot, which is why it succeeds. The film had the chance to score with audiences, if it weren't for the poor marketing. It could've soared past $100 million domestically, but it didn't. It could've convinced Disney to go in a different direction.Thankfully, The Emperor's New Groove never gets old. The character animation is fabulous, and the film functions more like a feature-length cartoon than a film. It has a Warner Bros. style, but that's not a bad thing. The characters are all likable and hilarious to boot. The humor is witty and it's almost devoid of pop culture jokes that somewhat littered the previous Disney films. (DreamWorks is good at doing that now, but they got that from the 90s Disney films) Kuzco and Pacha are a great duo, and the relationship between them is actually developed and not contrived in any way. Yzma is an outrageous villain that recalls the crazier female Disney villains like Cruella De Vil and Madam Medusa. Her sidekick Kronk, has a heart and just can't be a villain, which makes him all the more funny. The Emperor's New Groove's visual style is unpretentious and great, as it has a more loose film from the other Disney films. Take the jungles for example. The trees have odd shapes, unlike the realistic trees in Tarzan. Some of the animals in the film have a unique style, like a pack of jaguars that give chase to Kuzco early on in the film. It's all great.A 9.8 out of 10. A near-flawless Disney film.

Long gone are the musical numbers and the fairy tales, gone are the beautiful heroines and the malevolent villains; this little film is a breath of fresh air that takes Disney to the unexplored terrain of satire, parody and irreverent comedy. And the trip is well worth.The movie is about the young and arrogant Kuzco (David Spade), the Emperor of an Incan nation who enjoys his life of pleasure and comfort without caring too much for his people. Until one night, his second in command, Yzma (Eartha Kitt) betrays him and tries to poison him. Fortunately, the formula only converts Kuzco into a talking llama, however, with him in that form Yzma is able to usurp the power and gets rid of Kuzco. Now, the young Emperor will have to learn to live in a world harsher than what he knew and try to recover his throne.Well, while the plot outline sounds like another one of Disney's dramatic epic adventures, this movie has indeed a new groove. History says, that the film was actually going to go that way but director Mark Dindal and writers Chris Williams and David Reynolds took the story in a completely new direction, making a feature unlike any of the rest of Disney's classics. The film is packed with a very clever sense of humor that can be understood in many levels; it is not only mere slapstick, it goes beyond and as written above, has more in common with the Warner Bros. animations of Chuck Jones' days. The characters are perfectly well-designed and are definitely the soul of the film.However, the departure in content does not mean that the rest has changed. Despite all the apparent irreverence, the movie is suitable for kids and the morals and the message are still there, it's just that the package is now more entertaining than before. The animation technique still has Disney's top notch quality and the beautiful Inca-inspired designs give the film a fresh new look. The tone and mood of the story allows the film to explore many things that Disney had never tried and overall is a new modernization to their style.The cast is amazing and responsible of most of the success of the film. David Spade is brilliant as Kuzco and his domain of the character is total. It's hard to imagine someone else doing the voice. John Goodman plays Pacha, the only man who believes the talking llama is actually Kuzco, and his performance is very good. However, Eartha Kitt as Yzma and Patrick Warburton as her sidekick Kronk steal the show. If Spade and Goodman are brilliant then Kitt and Warburton are simply perfect.The film is definitely among the funniest films ever done by Disney and it is almost flawless. Even when it uses some pop culture references the film doesn't feel dated or silly thanks to the very subtle way that kind of humor is used. Still, the movie has been attacked for deviating from the classic Disney film and while the criticism has some good points (the film's simplicity for example), it still is a memorable and effective film that delivers lots of laughs and pure entertainment.The Emperor's New Groove may not be a landmark of animation such as Beauty and the Beast, but personally I think it represents a breath of fresh air for Disney and one of the most funny animated films ever done. While it is understandable that not everyone will catch the film's humor, this personal favorite is a very recommended film. 9/10 "}{"Title":"The funniest Disney film every made","Date":"24 June 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The Emperors New Groove is quite frankly one of the most quirky animated movie you can find, it should have been a hit but failed to make good at the box office.the jokes are beyond classic and when watching this film you should expect the unexpected, it's pretty obvious that it's done by the same makers of Cats Cant Dance due to it's animation style but if it's not then i've made a huge error.you'll probably never see a movie like the emperors new groove again, i one day hope to prove myself wrong by writing such a movie which will be difficult because these sort of movies tend to suck all the good ideas out of the world and put them into one surefire hit, so it'll be a difficult task to even get close to this level of hilarity.

Disreguard all those if you walk past Emperor's New Groove in the local Video store.Disney has gone completely against the grain in the funniest, quirkiest animated film I've seen.The story is about an egotistical Emperor (Kuzco) who's life turns upside down when his evil ex-assistant (Yzma) plots to kill him and take over his empire. Nothing is that simple of course, cue, the hilarious and frantic beginning, middle and end of a non stop roller-coaster ride. On this ride is also Pacha, a kind-hearted peasant who gets caught up in the misunderstanding.This is a film the entire family will enjoy due to the humour being more Simpsons like than the traditional Disney giggles.With a film that includes Smart-ass kiddies, twisted Squirrels and a docile yet lovable henchman, this film pushes all the buttons without having a sick bucket love story thrown in.And with 'Kronks New Groove' due out this December, I'll be the first in line to get a copy.

An emperor in Mesoamerica is dethroned and turned into a llama...as often happened in Mesoamerica....with the help of a good hearted villager he gets his throne back, turns into a human again and learns to be a good person.OK, so that sounds very Disney, but instead of witty dialogue, ENG relies a lot of slapstick, pratfalls and RoadRunneresque escapades. Many times the animation borders on the psychedelic, while returning again to the standard Disney cartoon world.I watched this when I was sick as my cure for most of my friends is to cook them a nice vegetable soup and bring them a Disney cartoon.

It is even more rare that such a film should be hilarious even with the sound turned off. The animation here, though, proves an extremely welcome exception.Another part of the film's appeal is its constant gimmickry with its narrative. The action is often interrupted by the narrator for various reasons, and the film has little respect for logic (which might annoy but doesn't - far from it). The mere fact that they have used voice-over is refreshing, but that they have used it in a refreshing way is that even more.I did not know that Spade played the titular character, so I cringed immediately when I heard his voice, for I don't regard him quite as highly as some do. However, my fears proved pointless as he proved himself well-cast with his well-suited voice. Goodman is always dependable, whether it be voicing or not, and the rest are equally fine. Nonetheless, Warburton is a gem, the gem here, I dare say, and given the right role, can do miracles. Hell, he doesn't even need good material to make me laugh, but here he is perfectly cast as Kronk.The screen-writer David Reynolds seems to have some TV sketch comedy to his credit, and it shows - in a positive way. The script is energetic, witty, very silly and full of hilarious dialogue, random moments and clever reuse of its earlier elements. Also, the film's relative brevity is a pro, not a con. Concise, constant hilarity.I am very, very pleased with the fact that they changed the initial nature of the film. If they hadn't turned this into a comedy, said (very broad) genre wouldn't have seen one of its funniest representatives I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It looks like I am going to have to buy this one. Did I already say it's hilarious? (Oh look, how clever of me - and how inarticulate.)---December 8, 2005I recently saw this for the second time and found it a bit less hilarious, although I still agree with much of the above. In particular I thought the emperor should've been slightly different and that Spade shouldn't have been cast after all. I would have found the character more satisfying had his dialogue not been so laden with this rather annoying teenage lingo, that is, had he not been one to eagerly use this rather annoying teenage lingo. Yes, he's supposed to be an irritating (muffin), but he could've been a more intelligent, more bored, more cynical, irritating (muffin). Imagine, say, the late George Sanders uttering his lines...Well, I ain't the filmmaker here. Despite the ever-visible Disney boundaries the whole is still a good one, which can't be said about, say, the above comment. I mean look at the bloody summary.

Disney used to make good animated features when I was younger (e.g. Aladdin, Lion King, etc), movies that managed to toe the line between overly sentimental smarmy and utterly mindless fart jokes, all the while throwing in a catchy (if frequently annoying) musical number or ten; nowadays they make pretty well unmitigated garbage. From about the time they made Pocahontas on... ugh, it all got so preachy, lost the ability to make the adults suffering through the movie laugh at a few choice 'older' jokes secreted in - sorry, I'm blathering.Anyway, Emperor's New Groove is a fantastically funny movie. Seriously, the only thing I can think of is that someone storyboarded this out as your average Disney tripe (as you can see shades of formula in it), but then the actual writers and animators busted out a bottle of JD and rewrote it before passing out on the tables. David Spade usually just annoys me, as he usually (almost unfailingly, really) plays a total jerk with no redeeming qualities, but here he plays a self-centered young emperor who actually *gasp* learns a thing or two and grows up a bit in the course of the movie, all without soapbox lecturing or moral-spouting song-and-dance numbers. John Goodman lends a nice turn as the loyal (if gullible) yet stern peasant who helps the emperor because it's the right thing to do. Meanwhile, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton steal the show with wonderful and ludicrous lines, situations, plots - you name it.This movie is so full of rapid fire jokes and quick visual gags that you almost have to watch it several times to catch everything, and even then it's a great movie to relax and let loose a few laughs.

Ripping to shreds a long-enduring Disney tradition, The Emperor's New Groove sports an almost song-less soundtrack by Sting, and the couple of songs that made the cut are entertaining.

These films are by no means bad, but personally, the more old-fashioned style of animation created on the drawing boards seems to hit a sweeter chord than those that have been brought about using 3D models and backrounds (though Finding Nemo and Toy Story are brilliant too, I must admit). Perhaps its the feeling that these films are more reminiscent to the way things were before the digital age, or perhaps its the fact that the drawings for the 2D movies give it that extra cartoony feel without the concept of realism and hence, can simply be enjoyed to the max as a .... cartoon.What The Emperor's New Groove does so well where possibly others have failed is that it does not take itself seriously, not because it lacks realism, but due to the actual script and storyboard itself. There aren't many drama moments that try to make the audience weep and when it does happen, the makers have opted to add a quick punch line or a quick extra animation short that makes you laugh out once again. Some may argue that this gives the movie less substance but this in fact is a refreshing change to the tried and tested formula of the happy-to-sad-then-happy-again rollercoaster many other animation films have become famous for.I for one am extremely pleased with this Disney release and however you want to look at it, The Emperor's New Groove is a great success and should be viewed by everyone simply for the - very many - comedic moments it has to offer.

But in 2000, there was an animated film that was probably the most underrated animated film of all time, The Emperor's New Groove is more original than Shrek as it doesn't venture into the typical story book setting. It goes into ancient South America, it's about an arrogant, nasty, horrible Aztec Emperor Kuzko (David Spade) who wants to build a beach resort on top of a hill occupied by a lama herder named Paca (John Goodman) and his entire family. Kuzco offers him the opportunity to find a new place to live before he knocks down his house. All during this time, one of his advisers (Eartha Kitt) secretly plots to kill him so she can take his throne. When her assistant grabs the wrong potion, it turns Kuzco into a Lama. Now Kuzco must convince the angry Paca to help him turn back into a human and gain back his throne. The Emperor's New Groove spoofs Disney films in each and every way. David Spade plays what he does best, an arrogant, whiny jerk. John Goodman plays a great side kick.

John Goodman co-stars as Pacha, the lovable peasant who discovers that the Emperor is plotting to destroy his home to build a summer Villa. Kzco is being plotted against by Izma (Eartha Kitt is a bit of genius casting) and her dim-witted sidekick Gronk, whose attempt to poison him turns the Emperor into a Llama.From there, the movie is a buddy adventure as the unlikely pair of Pacha and Kuzco try to find there way back to the palace and restore Kuzco to the throne.The laughs abound. In the movie's best scene, the four leads are all in a restaurant ordering lunch and going unnoticed to eachother. It displays perfect comic timing, and even a very subtle tribute to Five Easy Pieces.The best thing about this movie is the voice-over work of Patrick Warburton as Gronk. As the loyal and dense side-kick, he plays that standard Disney role of the villain with a conscience, this time, quite literally. Gronk wants to be a servant and a chef, but we also find out he can dance, clean and speak fluent squirrel.This is not Disney's most artistic accomplishment, nor its greatest feat of creativity.

The vibrant colours and huge over-the-top scale are seriously entertaining. There are some exhilarating sequences in this film as it makes the most of its settings.--The humour in The Emperor's New Groove is quite often hysterically funny. The simplest of jokes are made into fits of laughter thanks to great voice work and some cool animated facial expressions. I particularly loved the character of Cronk, he was hilarious with his fondness of skipping and his mystery theme music.--The Emperor's New Groove is somewhat unique as it has a whole new kind of approach to its audience. I loved how it took Disney clichés so often used and made fun of them, in places it kind of felt like a spoof of past Disney movies. The directness to the audience (Kuzco often addresses the viewers) was also a nice touch, and helped me get involved in the film.--The movie has a number of catchy tunes, many performed by theme song guy Tom Jones. The score was also very cool.THE BAD--After the movie gets going, there isn't a whole lot of plot. We're basically just watching lots of (albeit, fun) exaggerated chase sequences and repetitive character conflicts, only to amount to the way overused bad-main-character-learns-life-lessons moral.--Sometimes you can tell that the animation has been put more to use for huge scale shots instead of the little things, leaving some annoying small details such as mouth movements going with the voice-over.RATING7/10 - It lacks a strong plot and originality with its story, but The Emperor's New Groove remains a very funny and involving adventure from Disney.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMENDAladdin (8/10) The Lion King (8/10) Lost & Found (3/10) Monsters, Inc.

The previews didn't do it justice. I don't think Disney quite knew how to market this crazy rollercoaster laughter trip. We finally had an afternoon free to see it as a family at the dollar movies. To my surprize we all enjoyed it, and were laughing out loud at this great off-beat comedy we weren't expecting. Fabulous performances by Eartha Kitt (Yzma) and Patrick Warburton (Kronk). She's the best Disney Villain since Cruella, but silly rather than sinister. And Patrick's performance as Kronk is priceless. So after watching it again a couple of times on DVD I realized that the comedy is so rich and clever, it reaches the wit-level of the classic Monty Python (but without any of the crudeness). So many great lines. The most memorable part that had me in stitches? When Yzma and Kronk follow Kuzko and Pacha's map trial. Great visual humour. Has to be seen - classic stuff! Well done Disney for breaking the ice and pushing the envelope. I think the fresh approach and stupendous success of Pixar's masterpiece Toy Story really woke them up. (Note how there are no main characters singing in this one either. Would have been unthinkable for a Disney animated feature a decade ago.)

And as I watched kids tugging their parents' arms -- parents whose attitudes seemed not too detache","Date":"20 June 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Another Disney movie, another cartoon... just how good was this going to be? While I enjoyed The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, the idea of a completely made-up story starring a hit-or-miss David Spade didn't appeal too much to me. But as it turns out -- and MUCH to my delight -- I think I may have found, if nothing else, one of the single funniest movies out there -- no joke! Read ahead, and I'll explain the method to my madness. Emperor Kuzco (Spade) is a spoiled-rotten, overgrown brat of a dictator who has everything he could ever want and everyone at his beck and call. But there are those bent on thwarting his lap-o'-luxury lifestyle -- in particular, Yzma and her no-brain-all-brawn servant, Kronk. Yzma and Kronk conspire to poison Kuzco and take over the empire, but their plan slightly backfires when the diluted poison merely changes Kuzco into a llama (not exactly dead, but then I don't know how being a llama feels). Kuzco is thrown out of the city, befriends a not-too-trusting peasant named Pacha (John Goodman) -- himself a victim of the former Emperor Kuzco's plans for a summer house (complete with waterslide) where Pacha's home stands -- and with a little help, attempts to change himself back into human form and regain his throne. New Groove, I'm convinced, is only a Disney movie in name. It comes off, more times than not, like an extended episode of the WB's Animaniacs -- but this is a good thing. Spade, drenched with sarcasm, delivers an oft-times hysterical performance; Kitt should have done this voice-over gig a long, long time ago in a role that I doubt few could have fulfilled as perfectly as she did; Goodman is much more subdued as Pacha, but it makes for a nice balance with Spade; even Wendie Malick as Pacha's wife, Chicha, gets into the fun with a few zingers herself. But... the real star here, in a part absolutely tailor-made for him, is Warburton. In a role that could have been just another henchman, Warburton transforms Kronk into the ultimate object of clueless likeability (a la David Puddy -- Elaine's on-again-off-again boyfriend on Seinfeld). Some of the funniest scenes -- and I was practically doubled-over at times -- are Kronk's arguments with his alter egos, the classic angel/devil shoulder buddies. Warburton puts a whole new spin on the act. And this is not a plug for Disney, but please do make the effort to see this movie. While it probably won't go down as a classic, it's sure to tickle even the most hard to find funny bones. Oh... and did I mention that the kids will have a lot of fun, too?

The sharp, angular animation, the hilarious writing and voice talents, the clever references, and the editing and direction make this movie an unappreciated gem.  Hopefully, in time, more people will come to appreciate this as cartoon film-making of the highest caliber.  There was no obvious selling out by dragging dopey, we-wrote-this-song-to-capture-an-overrated-Academy-Award-for-Best-Song pabulum to be force-fed upon an audience that just wants to see the old Disney magic doing what it does best.  This movie strikes the fine balance of appealing to people of all ages without sacrificing the quality of the writing and dialogue - not an easy task.  Seeing this movie has instilled a sense of faith in me that Disney CAN still deliver the goods without relying on selling soundtracks.  While David Spade (as Kuzco) and John Goodman (as Pacha) deliver hilarious and warming performances, Patrick Warburton (as Kronk) and Eartha Kitt (as Yzma) are two of the most enjoyable villains in Disney's pantheon of characters.  Kronk is probably the most lovable henchman Disney has ever produced.

Full-length animated movie politics aside, however, I loved the movie. It was really nothing like the Road to El Dorado.

They contain the obligatory song segments, a couple of comic relief characters, the same style, similar plot devices, and usually one featured song in the middle of it all that plays in toto while some animated music video plays across the screen.  Toy Story was a departure from this formula (and it was great) and The Emperor's New Groove is different too.  The humor is of a different ilk than previous Disney films, that I would characterize as slightly bizzare.  And partly for this reason I really enjoyed this movie.  I liked the characters Pacha, voiced by John Goodman, and Kronk, who though he plays on the team of the villain is very likeable.  I usually watch these movies for the benefit of children but it is nice when I can enjoy one as much as they do.

At only 77 minutes, it was too long. Perhaps if the story had had a quicker pace and funnier jokes, it would have seemed to go by quicker. As it is, it had only one or two really good jokes about every ten or fifteen minutes, and the space in-between them just seemed to drag and drag. I found myself laughing the most during the climax, when Yzma (expertly-voiced by Eartha Kitt) is turned into a cat and attempts to steal the potion that will turn Kuzco back into a human, and only occasionally throughout the rest of the film. The characters were well-cast (particularly Kitt, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and Wendie Malick), but David Spade got rather annoying after awhile. There were also (thankfully) no songs, with the exception being the opening sequence, featuring a funny little character that sings the opening song, voiced by Tom Jones.I wish Disney could back to making the kind of animated movies they used to do, like THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER (still my favorite animated Disney movie), ROBIN HOOD, LITTLE MERMAID, and the other classics. Heck, even BEAUTY AND THE BEAST was better than this one. (MULAN and A BUG'S LIFE are the only recent animated Disney films I liked.) Maybe the film would have been better had the studio stuck with the original story (and partially already produced film), which from what I understand was a more serious film. Little kids will like the comical situations, but probably won't have the attention span to sit through the whole thing, while adults will like some of the jokes and feel the movie has already been on two hours by the time it gets thirty minutes in.

Personally, I've found the vast majority enjoyable (with the glaring exception of Pocahontas), but there is still a marked decrease in quality between, say, Beauty and the Beast and Tarzan. You could see the movies falling into the same old rut over and over and over again. However, Emperor's New Groove changed all that. Instead of a contrived love story, there's a buddy comedy featuring the hilarious duo of David Spade and John Goodman. Instead of sappy morals (particularly the sappy morals of being yourself and of finding inner beauty), we get hilarious one-liners and laugh-out-loud situations. And instead of the cute comic sidekick, we get doe-eyed characters (particularly the children and the squirrel) with a significant bite. Needless to say, this one had me in stitches. One part of Emperor as well as the new Disney trend in general that somewhat saddens me, though, is the move away from the musical format. I know I'm somewhat part of a minority, but I've always loved the songs from Disney movies, even if they do seem intrusive. (Actually, I never thought of them as intrusive, really, but I know many people think that.) Disney hasn't put out an honest to goodness musical in quite a while. Although I do agree that not all Disney movies should be musicals, I also hope that they decide not to abandon the format entirely. Disney movies have recently been pretty much the only place for musicals on the big screen, so I would hope that they would continue to give us the great musical moments we've come to expect. But enough of my editorial. Emperor's New Groove is one of my favorite Disney movies ever and has surpassed Aladdin as the funniest Disney movie in my mind. So sit back, relax, and forget anything else Disney's ever done. This, I hope, is a sample of the future.

Jerkish emperor receives his comeuppance and learns a lesson, yada-yada.  The fun's more in the telling, as given here.  The change of heart doesn't come so terribly quickly as to be disconcerting, and feels somewhat earned through the chaos that ensues.  And chaos it is...through a rollercoaster ride of sight gags, verbal wordplay, conventional satire and a semi-talking squirrel.David Spade lends a biting sarcasm to Kuzco that is rare for hero-types in cartoons, and Patrick Warburton really steals the show with his understated and underneuroned Kronk.  I came to be waiting for every dry aside out of Kronk's mouth, he's so hilarious.  Such a lovely eulogy.I don't understand why some have said this is boring, as it's a pretty snappy ride.  I do understand why some haven't laughed so much-you need a pretty quick and warped mind to catch some of their throwaway lines, which are really some of the funniest.

The Lion King has a few chuckles in it, and Robin Williams' Genie in Aladdin is nothing short of hilarious, but something always seems held back. Not here. Perhaps Disney is learning a few lessons from the witty and wonderful folks at Pixar.Everything is here sight gags, clever dialogue, slapstick, screwball, satire, and lots more. Even when the movie resorts to clicheed plot devices, they are actually pointed out so we can all laugh at them. This movie is something special.Even the animation is brilliant. Stylish, bright and bombastic, the style reminds one of the similarly flashy but painfully unfunny Hercules. There are some obvious caricatures involved, and the effect is wonderful, blurring the line between fantasy and reality.The voice cast is wonderful. David Spade joins the long line of entertainers who have had little relevant voice-acting experience, and yet excel, even though few of their other projects are kid-friendly. Others include Eddie Murphy, Demi Moore and Jerry Orbach. John Goodman plays it straight, even heart-felt at times, but still retains a genial charm and never seems too mushy or rigid to be funny. Together, Spade and Goodman have marvelous chemistry and have their personal touches to add to the funny scenes and yet can handle the more dramatic scenes with dignity. This is fine work. Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton are likewise hilarious. Kronk is just one in a long line of Disney lunks and yet is one of the few that every member of the audience goes home liking. John Fiedler, a Disney veteran, shows that he still has what it takes, even at 75.Stereotypes are thrown out the window. (So is an old man, but that's another story.) Kuzko is obviously an orphan who has no intention of taking his responsibilities seriously, and for the longest time seems beyond redemption. Only at the end, do we feel he deserves his happiness and his surrogate family. This is a poor little rich boy who doesn't realize it through his self-delusion and immaturity until very late in the movie. Kuzko is not given a pretty girl to pursue and win the hand of. Such corny plot devices have no place here. A further nice touch is that it would be too easy to make Pacha a single father, but his whole family is not only included but empowered.Little touches mark the loving care placed into the project. The scene where a broken-hearted Kuzko is forced to eat grass like the other llamas reminds us of the Prodigal Son (which, of course, he is). The scene in which Yzma and Kronk attempt to fly across a ravine owes more than just a nod to Chuck Jones.After the appalling Dinosaur, Disney pulled this out of their storage room and surprised and delighted us all. Let us hope that they use this flavour in the future, and remember what animation is truly all about. Not to be pretentious, but to be enjoyed.

David Spade is notorious for his sarcasm and snide comments, and they abound in this film.  The storyline here is darker than previous Disney animated films.  One of the special features on the DVD is a deleted scene in which Pacha's village is destroyed, and while it is shown in its unfinished form, it is obvious why it wasn't included.  It is a very dark, violent, and foreboding scene, and it brings new light to the film, especially when watched after viewing the movie in its entirety.  Simply put, this isn't your typical children's movie, and it seems to be aimed at a more mature audience.The story revolves around Emperor Kuzco, an egotistical ruler with a heavy hand, who is turned into a llama by his nemesis Yzma and her faithful sidekick, Kronk.  Kuzco is ends up on Pacha's cart, and is transported back to his village, and various hijinks occur as Pacha tries to help Kuzco return to his palace, and ultimately regain his human form.In my humble opinion, Kronk steals the show here.  Spade & John Goodman do a good job as Emperor Kuzco and Pacha respectively, but Kronk, while something of an idiot, brings comedic moments to this film which are necessary.  Watch his facial expression on the way to the secret lab, and keep an eye on him during the jump-rope scene at Pacha's hut later on in the movie.  Simply put, it's hilarious.  Patrick Warburton's flat delivery of lines for this character adds dimension (surprisingly) to the typical idiot character which appears in almost all Disney films.Rumor has it that this film was originally a lot different, a lot darker, until Disney stepped in and took over.  A viewing of the deleted scene gives some insight into what the film may have been like had it not been changed.  I've always been amazed by the fact that Disney can make films geared at kids, but which also appeal to adults. However, more recently, and unfortunately, Disney has used its reputation for having excellent story lines and creating films which teach lessons to enter into the direct-to-video market, thus taking advantage of children and their parents, and disappointing Disney fans who would rather see films which are good enough for theatrical release. Even though these particular films are released by Disney, they are just like any other direct-to-video film.  They should be avoided, and aren't anything to write home about.While not as good as Tarzan or The Lion King,   The Emperor's New Groove is a pretty good way to keep the kiddies quiet on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, and the adults might get something out of it as well.Note  The DVD version contains, among other goodies, a neat little animated game, a multiple choice Q&A which you can play with the children after they watch the movie.

There's no epic feel to it and the situations are silly.  But I think that's what makes the film.  It's incredibly fast-paced with a great sense of comedic timing (reaction humor is one of the funniest forms of comedy out there, in my opinion), witty one-liners, and complete unpredictability make it stand out from the other Disney films.  It makes fun of itself, speaks directly to the audience at time, and when it throws logic out the window, it doesn't hold back on pointing it out.  Disney's never done (not to my immediate recollection, anyway) a buddy flick before, and the fact that it doesn't pull any stops on the comedy makes it really enjoyable.  And to it's true appeal, Yzma and Kronk are by far some of the most entertaining villains that Disney has done in a LONG time.  Finally, bad guys with real personality.

There were some moments that didn't draw much of a giggle and it was somewhat slow to start off with, but by the film's climax the laughs are coming pretty hard and fast.Also breaking with tradition, there is nothing ground-breaking or state-of-the-art with the animation.  That's not to say that the animation is bad!  It's the standard Disney work, beautiful and subtle, just no CG eye-candy trying to make up for a lack-lustre story.The background music fits in well but there are no show-stopping musical scenes.  A welcome change.  The tunes are nothing memorable which isn't necessarily a bad thing either.  As for the characters, Yzma and Kronk in my opinion, steal the show!  There are some hilarious scenes between these two.  I loved Yzma right from the start, and Kronk really does grow on you.  I'm not a big fan of David Spade (or his sitcom Just Shoot Me) and to be honest I walked in feeling a little skeptical about him, but he did a really good job in the role of Kuzco.  Thumbs up to John Goodman as Pacha as well.I can really only sum this film up as different.  But different in a very good way.  The Emperor's New Groove is not about the fancy-schmancy animation or the music or the big-name voice actors.  It's about the story, and a good one at that.  After Tarzan I was beginning to think that Disney had really lost the plot for good but it seems as though they could be back on track, breaking some new ground as well.  As with all Disney animated flicks, this is one aimed at the kiddies but it seems as though the humor has matured just a bit (seems like the current trend), so young people and adults are bound to get a few laughs.

Still, I took seriously the odyssey of Kuzco, the emperor-turned-llama.  This handsome young man is arrogant and selfish, yet one doesn't hate him.  One senses deep down he has the potential to be a good person if he can just get over his spoiled upbringing.  It may take the trial of turning into a beast, a la Disney's Beauty and the Beast, to get him to take a good look at himself.  But will he learn?  This film kept me guessing.  On the one hand, it would be a shame is he learned nothing from his trials.  But on the other hand--this is a quirky and irreverent film, if you remember.  Perhaps the filmmakers would consider it the ultimate joke if after all he'd been through, Kuzco learned nothing.  See it for yourself to find which road Kuzco chooses.

Although not promoted as one of their major christmas motion pictures, it clearly has everything a good animated movie needs and more. It features non of the typical Disney elements (i.e. 'soft' humor, lots of singing, cute and funny supporting figures etc.) but instead gives us great puns, a lot of self-irony and a plotline that keeps the raised forefinger of moral a bit in the background. Both the style of drawing and the humor reminded me more of recent cartoons like '2 Stupid Dogs' or 'The Simpsons', the gags hit straight in the face and the characters are so exaggerated that they are simply cool.

Yet, along with all this, Lion King had the love put into it that made it the wonderful movie that it was.  All the Disneys after it had all the components but the Love!Not that New Groove didn't have some of the qualities aforementioned, it had music (But not sung by the characters), it had a lesson to be learned, and it had eye candy animation (But who says that's a bad thing if the heart is in the right place?)... everything else had a groove of it's own. Disney certainly got a  New Groove going when they came up with this movie!  It's unlike any other Disney I've seen. It was a laugh a minute for me.  I must have missed every other joke in it because I was laughing so hard at the joke before it!

Lately, Disney's films seem more like two-hour commercials for toys and CD soundtracks and McDonalds merchandise and Saturday morning spin-offs.But not this.  I walked into The Emperor's New Groove expecting the typical Disney corporate product, and came out reminded of the classic Warner Brothers Looney Tunes.  It's like the Disney screenwriters and animators have been saving up all their attitude and screwball gags from the last couple of features and put them all in here, one comic-anarchy joyride.  Only one song (delightfully sung by Tom Jones), no adorable animal sidekicks, just wit and humor.  Sure, the plot is thin, and it doesn't have the same visual polish as Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King, but you get swept along so quickly you hardly notice.The vocal casting here is perfect.  A little David Spade goes a long way for me, but here he's perfect as the self-absorbed Kuzco.  John Goodman is his usual Everyman self as Pacha, and Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton are fantastic as the villains Izma and Kruk.  By the time it was all over, I wouldn't have minded spending another hour or two with these characters, delightful and unique as they were.I'd like to think The Emperor's New Groove marks a new direction for Disney in the 21st Century, but I doubt it.  From what I understand, Groove is something of a throwaway, created out of a half-completed traditional animated feature and given a life of its own.  Instead I think this will stand as a monument to the energy and wit Disney could have if they stepped outside their deeply-carved niche (read rut) and tried a new groove of their own.  Groove will forever stand apart, much like Fantasia sixty years ago; a unique stepchild unlike anything Disney has done before and is unlikely to do again.

It is in your face, it is funny, it is deadpan, and the animation is that same gorgeous Disney animation that we have always known and loved.In a nutshell, spoiled brat Emperor Kuzco breaks the news over the head of selfless, caring Pacha that he is destroying his village to make way for Kuzcotopia, his ultimate summer getaway. His plans are put on halt when his ex-advisor, Yzma, and her assistant Kronk, plot to kill him with poison over dinner but turn him into a llama instead. Kronk has the llama in the bag, with plans to kill him outside of palace grounds, but then trips over a cat and the bag ends up riding out of town on Pacha's cart. Once he is discovered, Pacha and Kuzco the llama are stuck in a four-day journey together back to the palace to turn him back.Everything about this movie is great. The humor is so dry, and so realistic. (Scenes to look for The dialogue between Kuzco and Yzma in the dining room once Kronk runs out, realizing his spinach puffs are burning; The dialogue between Kuzco and Pacha the morning after the first night they spent in the wilderness.) The animation is also fabulous. (Scenes to look for The opening, narrated by David Spade, with the big-eyed pitiful llama slopping around the rain and mud that makes you actually feel bad for him; The zoom-out scene when Kronk has just dropped the bagged Kuzco the llama into a river and, on an impulse, caught him again to keep him from dropping down a waterfall which must fall for eternity.)I also enjoyed the voices that were cast in this movie. All the roles seemed tailor-made for them. David Spade, of whom I am a big fan, was spectacular with a lot of lines, even scenes, that could have fallen flat without his deadpan, right-on voice. John Goodman's resonant voice was the perfect fit for humble, sweet Pacha. Eartha Kitt, with her spitty, articulate, scratchy voice, brought the character of Yzma to life. And I enjoyed Patrick Warburton as the clueless, dumb yet entirely endearing Kronk to no end. In fact, Kronk and ChiCha (Pacha's wife, voiced by Wendie Malick), were my two favorite characters. (Scenes to look for Any time Kronk is cooking to see him in action; for a glimpse of ChiCha's personality pay attention to Pacha's homecoming.)And this movie was surprisingly funny. To kids AND adults, and everyone in between (which is where I fall). In fact, many of the adults in the theatre were laughing harder than the children. (My favorite joke in the movie? The recurring Okay, why does she even HAVE that lever? is great, especially the second time, when the llama emerges with the crocodile gnawing on him.)I liked this movie so much that I saw it twice. (The second time was an accident; Cast Away had no empty seats, but this movie was my next in line to go for.)I can't think of any criticism for this movie. Oh yes, and I also enjoyed Sting's music very much -- I am a big fan, but even if I wasn't, the songs are catchy. This movie is very well done, and very, very entertaining. After all, it's not really meant to give you something to think about; it's meant to entertain, and The Emperor's New Groove certainly delivers.

No, I mean Michael Eisner's Disney, the soulless marketing machine that has leeched away its creativity in its quest to boost the stock price.So my wife and I attended New Groove reluctantly, and only because it was the sole movie at the 24-theatre multiplex that was on at the right time and wasn't sold out. I rated it a 6, and have no problem stating that New Groove is the most original movie from Disney since, perhaps, pre-Little Mermaid days.Good things Voices (David Spade was perfectly whiney, the guy who played Puddy on Seinfeld was great as the oaf assistant, and Eartha Kitt was a purrrrrfectly evil villian), NO INSIPID SONGS, no cutesy sidekick characters for alleged comic relief, and maybe best of all, NEW GROUND was broken. For once we watched a movie headed into who knows what direction (of sure, the overall plot was predictable, but the details were interesting), and we saw things that were oddly inexplicable but endearing (this emperor like to dance, hence The Groove).Bad things The inexplicable but endearing stuff was never fully utilized (what, no raves at the palace?), the movie dragged at times during the llama emperor's journey, and, ultimately, you didn't really care about any of these characters. You just wanted to have fun.So a grudging tip of the hat to Disney.

She makes the perfect villain (and with a small nod to her past as Catwoman from the old TV Batman series).The jokes come fast and furious with the jabs and barbs hitting everyone, including the movie, itself.  Dare I say it?  Yes, I do.  Disney has finally figured out that spark of zaniness that has always been a hallmark of Warner Brothers cartoons.  I've always felt that Warner Brothers knew how to make a short while Disney knew how to make a full-length and never the twain shall meet.  And that was because silliness is hard to maintain for very long while condensing sweetness down to such a short time makes it cloying. Well, Disney has figured out the former.If you can't handle silly, if you're looking for real meaning, if you can't appreciate sheer ridiculousness simply for its own sake, then you'll hate this movie.If you appreciate following the joke where it leads, if you can go with the gag without worrying that it doesn't make logical sense, if you like the sidetracks better than the main path, this is a must see.

The circle of life might indeed sound a bit over the top. This time, despite a slightly moralising theme, the crazy plot is nothing more than a great pretext for wacky situations. Unlike the last films where all the sets were almost screaming look how artsy this is! look how great our stuff is! look at what I can do! here, some great looking sets are present with a discretion that goes to their honour. When Pacha leaves the palace at the beginning of the film and walks back to his village, his route is delightful to the eye, without annoying violins ruining it by desperately trying to point it out.Disney also seems to have given up the song every seven minutes policy. There's only one song in the film, and that's quite enough. More would brake the groove. The voices are excellent. David Spade has the fake crying and whining that makes him so delightfully annoying in Just Shoot Me. And Patrick Warburton has his serious and brainless tone of voice in the most inappropriate moments. (He left without paying his check.) This is just to name a couple.Much like Scream, or Austin Powers, in a completely different theme though, the film makes fun of itself. The characters don't expect us to believe the absurd Hollywood-like coincidences of their adventure, and seem to be quite aware of the fact they're only characters of a film. And, in any case, how serious can a Jewish New York diner in the middle of a pre-Columbian South American jungle be? Especially when the waitress expresses her happiness with a blasé Mazel Tov? How come, in the end of every action film, the bad guys so often seem to get in the way of the good guys in the most unlikely of ways? Who cares? seems to be the general attitude of The Emperor's New Groove.The four main characters follow a seemingly endless series of misadventures, all more unlikely and more hilarious than the other. They spoof other films and parody a lot of situations. There are no tasteless jokes, as there were in The Lion King. They play with stereotypes and attitudes. They achieve a lot by not taking themselves too seriously.That's just the kind of humour I like. I couldn't stop laughing. I saw it twice in a row.And why does Ysma have that lever anyway?

Their most recent offering, though patterned on the latter, lacks the trademark songs and forays into morality, opting instead for an old fashioned cartoon.  A gutsy move indeed.Kuzco is a self centered spoiled brat, but when you're the 18 year old ruler of a South American country, that's not a stretch.  When Kuzco fires Yzma, his trusted advisor and her behemoth helper Kronk, they decide to do away with him.  Although they bungle the attempt on his life, they do succeed in turning him into a Llama.  More troubling than being turned into a beast of burden is Kuzco's knowledge that he is at the mercy of the very peasant whose land he was about to appropriate for a summer home.  Who ever said life is easy?One of the qualities that I enjoyed most about Iron Giant was that the characters didn't keep breaking out into song - it's not that I don't enjoy musicals, but they can grow tiresome.  I didn't know what to expect from this movie mainly because I knew they had changed the content several times, probably fearing a repeat of Road to El Dorado's bad box office. Radically altering the course of a film midstream generally leads to problems (does anyone remember Supernova?), and at the very least, I doubt Sting will ever offer to score another Disney film after they scrapped the bulk of his songs.  Fortunately this break with the Disney convention works.Although I'm not a huge David Spade fan, the combination of his skewed sarcastic humor and excellent animation is exactly what the emperor-turned- Llama calls for, making Kuzco a character we like, in spite of the fact that he is a shameless cad.  On the other end of the spectrum is Pacha, voiced by Jon Goodman, the kind and caring peasant who is willing to help Kuzco although it may be to his detriment.  Yzma, Kuzco's scheming right hand woman, is brought to life by Eartha Kitt's raspy voice and spot on animation (before you even hear her voice you know who the actor is), and is positively scary, but in a nice way.  Finally,  Kronk (Puddy from Seinfeld who incidentally will be starring in a live-action version of The Tick on FOX) the sidekick wanna-be, is hilarious as the double-digit-IQ-walking-slab-of-muscle more concerned with cooking than killing.The combination of the sixties style animation, solid characters and slapstick style result in a movie that is pure, simple and unmitigated fun.

But this is not a philosophical  or moral piece with moments of comedy. This is a roller-coaster of laughs that I haven't seen since the likes of Aladdin. The animation is sharp and colourful. Definitely up to scratch.When the movie's over, as the kiddies munch into their Emperor's New Groove Happy Meal with wind up Lama, Mum and Dad will feel like they've got their money's worth. There is so much in this for adults. David Spade and John Goodman prove once again that Disney producers have an ear for voice talent. They make a great comedy duo.  The fact that their lines were probably recorded weeks apart shows how good these performers (and editors) are. With so many one-liners and quips, I wonder how many were improvised.  I'm sure a lot of it will go over younger children's heads, but the eye candy will keep them entertained. So many sight gags are involved, this does need a second viewing.It's great to see a Disney movie so tongue in cheek! Very refreshing, very enjoyable. A modern classic! Go see!

How many of you don't show a sign of friendship with a friend? Thought so. And then this is Kusco's probably first friend EVER. So its special for him. Then when I see the movie (especially the ending) Kusco probably sees Pacha as the father he never had and Pacha's family as HIS family. Kusco COULD pass for Pacha's young adult son.

He is accidentally found by a peasant (John Goodman) who helps him get back to his castle, avoiding cliffs, waterfalls, scorpions, bats, leopards, canyons, but they never get even a scratch, just like Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote. During his journey back, he develops a sensitivity he didn't have before, and after he finds the potion to become a man again, he is destined to become a good king, with a New Groove.The scenes are very inventive, the dialog very witty, and I found myself laughing spontaneously often. Spade and Goodman were especially a good comic team. But my favorite character was Kronk, the not-too-smart giant of a bad guy who acted like a little kid every chance he got. Tom Jones, the singer, provides some of the background music.However, this is not really a movie for small children. Several times the characters say they want to kill and at least once use the word hate to express an ill feeling.  Small children do not need unnecessary exposure to that.  Overall I rate it 7 of 10 for good entertainment fluff.  Maybe a 6 would be better. Not as good as recent animated movies like Tarzan, A Bug's Life, Prince of Egypt, and the two Toy Story films.

After he fires his administrator, Yzma, she uses her magic to turn him into a llama, rendering him powerless so she could rule the kingdom in his place. He needs the help of llama herder Pacha to regain his throne, who is the one with the village he plans to destroy.This movie is soaked with slapstick comedy and modern-day clichés, from the hip-sounding Kuzco to Pacha's typical Hollywood-acting family, and from David Spade's narration to Kronk's (Yzma's sidekick) big oaf personality. Everywhere you turn, there are gags, modern-day dialog and more humor, which can be distracting in a movie that is supposedly set in ancient times. The plot is simple with few twists and turns, as it mostly concentrates on Pacha trying to help Kuzco get back his throne, with Yzma and Kronk in pursuit. But, I have to say that the film did crack me up a few times, especially during the scenes with the hilarious Yzma. The animation is also very colorful and vibrant.Overall, it's a very silly movie with overblown jokes, limited character development and plot substance.Grade D "},{"Title":"Quite sad how rushed it was.","Date":"5 October 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" The production of this movie is disheartening to say the least, and if you want to know why watch The Sweatbox.

He summons Pacha (John Goodman) to tell him that he, his family, and the rest of the village must make way for his lavish plans and find somewhere else to live. Kuzco also fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his adviser, and in her fury she plans to poison him and ruling in his absence. Yzma's dim-witted but lovable henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton) gives Kuzco the wrong poison, and instead turns him into a llama. She trusts Kronk to finish the job, but he doesn't have the heart to let Kuzco die and eventually loses him amongst the villagers. Stranded in the jungle with his new llama body, he entrusts Pacha to protect him and return him to his palace, without having any intentions of changing his holiday home plans.After a hugely troubled production (the title was originally Kingdom in the Sun and the plot involved a peasant look-a-like and a llama herder love-interest), The Emperor's New Groove arrived in 2000 to enjoy slim box-office success, something that Disney would have to get used to. The decision to swap the old-fashioned love story and moral preachings for a more silly and modern buddy-movie was a wise one, and film benefits especially from the work of Patrick Warburton, the man with possibly the best voice in comedy (he also does the voice of paraplegic Joe in Family Guy). Yet the tale is still an overly-familiar one, with the enlightenment of an ignorant rich kid amongst mixing with the lower- classes failing to find anything original to say.The character of Kuzco is especially loathsome, but where usually the actor/voice artist would be talented enough to make the character endearing, in the hands of David Space, an actor of such a startling lack of talent, is annoying, and remains annoying throughout. There were times where I felt like shouting at Pacha to just kick him off a cliff. I found the whole experience quite charmless, and in an age of high- definition CGI animation, it is nice to see Disney take a traditional approach. Yet where their early films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Bambi (1942) were drawn with expert beauty and love, Groove just looks lazy and heartless. It's not a total failure, the film is sporadically funny with the aforementioned Kronk getting most of the laughs, and Earth Kitt does some fine work as the twisted Yzma. But it's no wonder Disney would buy Pixar, as judging from this they were lacking from anything resembling inspiration or innovation.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Why do we even have that lever?","Date":"26 May 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I cannot stand typical Disney movies, and even if they could overcome their lazy, tiresome formulas, there would still be those insufferable stereotypes (Fat people are funny.

The sentimental and schlocky Lion King which allowed them to tell a story about Africa without depicting a single black person was a massive cop-out. First animated black leading man character, Disney? Any time now (...would still be forty years too late)!It's too sarcastic? Take your impressionable and precious little treasures to some other lifeless movie then. But I'll take dozens of movies like this wild card from Disney before I'd ever sit through one of their safe, wholesome family clunkers again.It is so blessedly free of the Disney formula; no trio of wise-cracking sidekicks, no crappy song about longing for more, no villain (as such) who needs to be defeated in the last 5 minutes. No princess! There's (in other words) no decisions made by the same committee that choked the life out of their last ten movies. If you want that, just rent any other Disney movie. Kronk is a hoot, as is Eartha Kitt.

In 2003 this seemed increasingly likely with Brother Bear being put forward as possibly Disney's final traditional feature. Truthfully, this feels like a good thing. With modern animation being pointed more towards the whole family, with jokes for adults as well as children, things have moved a long way since Walt made Snow White in 1937.As history was written, so Disney began it's slow decent towards it's conclusion. Whilst The Lion King is sometimes regarded as the finest 2D film Disney ever made, after Toy Story a year later, the trail has dried up really. So much so that with the worthy exception of Hercules (1997) it seemed that Disney would never produce a decent film again. With 2000's The Emperor's New Groove this theory was supported by yet another mediocre effort.With the voices of David Spade, John Goodman and Eartha Kitt, this story tells of Emperor Kuzco, betrayed by fired adviser Yzma, who is transformed into a Llama and stuck in a jungle with a peasant called Pacha. Teaming up, the two work together as they attempt to fix the Emperor's physical predicament.In recent times, companies like Dreamworks and Pixar have revolutionised entertainment. As a partner with Pixar, Disney's finest works in recent years have included jokes for the entire family. Films like Finding Nemo (2004) have entertained children and parents alike. Whilst these style of films have received better budgets and better writers, 2D films like this one have suffered. Directed almost entirely at children, the films are admittedly fun, but they are hideously inferior compared to some of the true classics. In effect, the magic is just lacking. Disney's finest films are often those which inspire ice shows or have popularity of such a degree that men dress up in suits of the characters years later. Films like The Lion King where the story has been relocated to the theatre and everyone identifies some of the characters. that just doesn't ever appear plausible for films like this one.All in all, The Emperor's New Groove is not a bad film. It's your regular, funny Disney film, but it just doesn't really click. It lacks characters like Timon & Pumba (Lion King), Hercules (Hercules) and even Genie (Aladdin). The Emperor is fun, but he's far from perfect. Perhaps it's finally time Disney lie down this type of animation down and let it drift into history.

The whole production was excellent Disney fare; highly entertaining and, of course, containing the typical Disney lesson. This one teaches you not to be too big for your breeches, that the world does NOT revolve around that Center of the Universe that is YOU, and that not everyone you think are your friends can be trusted.Emperor Kuzco has been spoiled since birth. Having been raised to be Emperor, his every whim was immediately granted, causing him to become a spoiled rotten, greedy little tyrant around whom the universe revolves.In his aggravated state over his regent dealing with the kingdom anytime his back is turned, he forgets (or perhaps has yet to learn) that not everyone is going to bow to his every whim. He fires Yzma (his regent), and in his self-absorbed state of mind, does not stop to consider that there may be repercussions. Ah, but there are.Yzma has her assistant Kronk (Richard Warburton of Scream 3) poison and KILL Kuzco, but instead, he goofs and turns the petty little schmuck into a llama. The rest of the movie deals with Kuzco learning his lessons and trying to find his way back home to the palace. Not an easy feat when he's never been in the jungles of his kingdom, in his life.After treating the whiny peasant Pacha like a red-headed step-child, he actually expects his help. Pacha, being a warm-hearted person, reluctantly gives it, but not without conditions. Conditions Kuzco breaks and breaks and breaks, of course, because he's still a SCHMUCK!This Disney production is quite amusing mainly because David Spade is such a complete and total @ss and he definitely gets what's coming to him. Nice to see that happen sometimes. You know? NO ONE likes a person who is THAT uncaring of others' feelings. Good movie, great story, decent animation and a lovely ending. The only thing I did not like about this movie was the animation. Disney's quality has gone down considerably in the last few years. They pay little or no attention to detail anymore. I hate that.

These Disney films, while sweet, are more or less formulaic in nature - they feature a plucky young hero (usually a heroine), a love interest, a wacky sidekick, and a good half-dozen or so schmaltzy songs from the likes of Elton John or Phil Collins.  While there's nothing wrong to this - `Beauty and the Beast' is a phenomenal film, as is `The Lion King' and `Aladdin' - it is a formula, nonetheless, and as such it leads to certain expectations when watching an animated Disney feature.`The Emperor's New Groove' lives up to none of these expectations.  As it turns out, this is a very, very good thing.  Despite lacking the traditional Disney film structure, `The Emperor's New Groove' is equal parts zany, silly, funny, clever, funny, and witty.  (Did I mention funny?) Apparently, while trying to channel the spirit of Walt Disney for `The Emperor's New Groove', director Mark Dindal and his animation team accidentally channeled the spirit of Tex Avery instead.  The film has a wonderfully absurd sensibility to it, where instead of watering down a simple story to entertain small children, it remains razor sharp, appealing on one level to kids . . . and on a totally different level to adults.  `The Emperor's New Groove', in its own way, is a homage to all those great Warner Brothers of yore created by Michael Maltese and Chuck Jones - as bizarre as it may seem, the classic `Rabbit Season! Duck Season!' cartoon would not be out of place in a film like this.  (Also, there is a squirrel in this film that seems to have literally wandered in from a Droopy Dog cartoon; it certainly possesses the wicked self-awareness of a Tex Avery character).Eschewing the idea that a hero must be likable, `The Emperor's New Groove' focuses, quite naturally, on the Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), the supreme ruler over a long-ago kingdom (presumably part of the Incan Empire, although that's never clearly stated).  Kuzco, who, much like Spade himself, is sarcasm incarnate, succeeds in annoying two important characters in the first few minutes of the film.  The first is the peasant Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), who is informed by Kuzco that his family's small house is to be demolished so that a pleasure palace called `Kuzcotopia' call be built in its place.  The second is Kuzco's treacherous advisor/sorceress Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt), who is pleasantly informed by Kuzco that the kingdom is `downsizing' and that her services are no longer needed.   Pacha takes his bad news with stoic, humble grace; but the evil Yzma decides that in order to save her job and become de facto ruler of the kingdom, she must kill Kuzco.  This being a Disney cartoon, she fails miserably in her assassination attempt, but does manage to magically transform Kuzco into a talking llama.  Kuzco the llama, still sarcastic but no longer omnipotent, finds himself cast out into the wilderness of his kingdom . . . and through a strange series of events, suddenly finds himself relying on the kindhearted, humble Pacha for help.The story's simple, but that's okay, since it's merely an excuse to string together a veritable calvacade of jokes, ranging from broad slapstick to rapier-sharp verbal wit.  The film never overtly tries to tug at the heartstrings of the audience - instead, it usually goes for the quick wisecrack or the funny sight gag, and if a few heartstrings are pulled in the process, well, that's just fine. The Emperor's New Groove is almost Disney with an attitude, except the attitude is hip, not smug.The jokes - and the film - are amazingly funny, and a large part of this success should be credited to the characters, and to the talented actors who voice them.  By far, the best character in the film is Yzma's dimwitted henchman Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), an affable thug who simply seems too stupid to be evil.  In his first few scenes, Kronk starts out as the typical Disney muscle-bound villain - thickheaded and prone to violence - but the villainy of Kronk slowly fades away as the film progresses, revealing a bizarrely hilarious character with Monty Python sensibilities. Kronk still dutifully follows the wicked Yzma's orders - to a point - but often performs such orders after setting his own priorities in order, such as baking spinach cheese balls or playing double dutch with kids.  It's loopy, but it works, and Kronk really is the lynchpin to this film's humor. John Goodman is also good as Pacha - he lends the film a certain amount of dignity, which is sorely needed, since the Emperor Kuzco isn't exactly a heroic figure.  He also gives the film a subtler layer of humor, as he quietly delivers some funny lines that can go unnoticed if you aren't paying strict attention to the film.  Eartha Kitt is absolutely delicious as the sorceress Yzma.  He plays her part as the ultimate spoiled diva; her character is a tightly wound emotional wreck, reacting to everything in such a sheer over-the-top fashion that it's pure comedy genius.  Ironically, the weakest character may be the Emperor himself - as Kuzco, David Spade and his acid wit are very funny at times, but the character remains abrasive for far too long.  He's almost too much to take at times, especially for kids - and face it; kids will be watching this film.  Toning Spade down a notch or two might have helped to smooth out the film and to make it better overall.Smart, hip, and daring to push the Disney envelope, `The Emperor's New Groove' is an outstanding film.  Adults will love it.  Kids might not get all the jokes, but they'll love it too - after all, `The Emperor's New Groove' is really just part of a zany cartoon tradition that kids have loved for a long, long time.  Just think of Bugs Bunny instead of Mickey Mouse as you put the tape in your VCR, and you and your family should be just fine. It's a very well done film.

Oh, yes. I did. Guilty.This is Disney's proof that they can still make an amazingly good movie. I am very surprised, though. I understand that the studio has two animation teams, which work on different Disney projects. One of them is far more powerful than the other, with more resources. If that is true, then Disney should promote the team that created Emperor, because, even tough it looks very cheaply made (when compared to Disney's high standards) it is a very entertaining, very good, very groovy film.It's all about Spade, actually. Reprising his role in Tommy Boy, we see the acidic, sarcastic character. He likes to torture everyone around him. He finds in Pacha his Tommy (if you haven't seen that film, it is highly recommended), a guy who is noble, likeable and sweet (as a matter of fact, both films are very similar, being road trips in some sort of sense). He, as you might expect, subjects his partner to all kinds of humiliations, until he learns his moral lesson. Pretty simple stuff, but it is handled with heavy doses of humor everywhere. This film succeeds because everything is funny, lighthearted and uncomplicated. Forget Tarzan's luscious scenery, or Hunchback's feeble attempts at humour launched at a mostly depressing scenario. This film is fast, furious and lighthearted. And musical interludes are kept to a minimum, and when used they are very effective. Yes!I loved it. I can only hope Atlantis will be as good as this one. A solid 9 (had it been animated by the heavy honchos of Disney, the result would have been different... surely for the worst).

It may have been above the 4 year old's head, but the point is it was clean and he watched it. I am not quite sure why everyone thinks that every Disney film or film that's geared toward kids has to be solely for children. Let's face it kids stop to stare at commercials.  Everything is new and somewhat confusing to them. It's part of growing up learning to puzzle these things out. Kids need things that are suitable for them true, but adults need things that they can be entertained by and occupy their child as well. Anyone who has kids or are around them know that you will spend a lot of time watching the same Disney movie or cartoon over and over and over and over.  Kids don't get bored with it because it's all new to them. So giving The Emperor's New Groove a poor rating based on the fact that your 4 year old didn't get every joke is inane, asinine, absurd..etc.      I gave this movie a 10 based on the fact that I was highly entertained. Critics need to try rating something based on what it is rather than what it isn't. Movies should either entertain, provoke thought, elicit an emotional response, be awe inspiring, or in some way advance movie making be it through technical machinations or plot devices etc. *see Citizen Kane*.  There are few films that have been successful in executing most of that criteria.      Will you laugh and giggle while watching this?...Yes...quite a bit.

You cant possibly get me to believe that the people who made this film had fun doing it, they went through hell...the whole story went through hell. Why? I guess cause they wanted to do a Disney film set in Latin America and they didn't want to count Saludos Amigos or Three CabellerosSo it's funny to hear how positive the creators made working on the film sounds. Oh this originally started out as a serious more Disney like musical called 'Kingdom of the Sun' but we scratched that. Of course this was the beginning of the original stories era. In a way it's a good thing that they didn't do Kingdom of the Sun (cuz I tire of the Prince and the Pauper adaptations done by Disney) but I'm sure they couldve come up with a better Latin American story that wouldve worked for Disney.What people, especially critics, fail to understand is that Disney films in the past have worked so well because there is an even balance of comedy, story, and drama. TENG was too much comedy and hardly the rest. Indeed they did Chuck Jones humor but let's be logical...why in the world would a Disney film want to pay tribute to one of its biggest animated rivals? In the future, shall we expect a Don Bluth tribute despite that fact that he walked out and kicked Disney in the butt when he made several animated hits in the 1980s?So my point here is that there was no way you could consider this a Disney movie, while I considered this the marking point the beginning of Disney's downfall which continues today. It's a very small cast but I supposed that they are all that's needed to get the job done. I don't like animated buddy comedies for some reason (Toy Story and Monsters Inc was good) I think that what made the buddy comedy idea fail for this was Pacha. God, he was so annoying! I think more audiences would relate more with Kuzco, a self centered person who has an odd way of showing his softer side. Well if I ever really really consider buying the DVD (which I doubt) then I would definitely have to check out the making of junk just so I can see the sweat hidden behind the creators smiling faces. All in all I would put this film in the lower half of the pack because this just doesn't contemplate what made a Disney film a Disney film.

While watching this movie I wondered more and more why Disney made it at all and after that why he decided to release it. It would better have stayed on the shelves, for later revision or for eventual placement into the dustbin. Recently I read that the script had been re-written several times and that most of the movie was re-made because Disney was not happy with it. So what what we see now is the second or third trial, that for one reason or another was released.  The main problem with this movie is -as said- that there simply is no strong story line. It is a collection of events, some of which are funny but most not funny at all. Nowadays Disney makes two or three movies a year, whereas in the past he made one in every two or three years. Maybe that is the main problem. The show must go on and on, with more and more output. So see it, if you are a Disney fan, but don't buy it.

Instead, you give us. . . David Spade?I'm still not sure how you can call this movie a version of The Emperor's New Clothes.  But of course, you wouldn't have the guts to do a true version of that story--some mother somewhere would complain about its immorality and its indecency, and you'd be the laughing stock of the animation world.Wait a minute.  You are already.  (End note).Begin review One of my biggest problems with this movie is that I can't stand David Spade.  Dana Carvey, a little, but Spade is just so grating to me in everything he does SNL, Just Shoot Me, his movies with Chris Farley.  His delivery is always obvious, usually slapping us over the head with them as if he was wielding a giant tuna.  Here, he's even more obnoxious and flat as a bratty Emperor (where's the royal family?) who wants to build a swimming pool on top of a peasant's (John Goodman) hill but ends up being turned into a llama by a conniving advisor.  Yeah.  A swimming pool on top of a hill in south America hundreds of years ago and a conniving, skull-faced advisor (think Jafar or Skar, only a woman).Spoiler Spade/Emperor also narrates the story throughout most of the movie, but the narration turns out to be bogus when the llama-fied Emperor suddenly tells the narrator that we (the audience) know what the real story was--the understatement of the millennium, I assure you, since Spade's one-note (over-the-top) narration is obvious before you even see his character as a human.  So all that annoying jibber-jabber turned out to be necessary for that one joke in which the character breaks character to talk to the narrator, who is apparently not the real Emperor or he would've known what the other Emperor was already thinking . . . oh, forget it.  It's a little funny simply because it's not expected, but it's not really original--I think Woody Allen did it a few times, and I know stuff like that happened in Looney Tunes on a regular basis.That's another problem.  The movie seems like an extended Looney Tune, something even Warner Brothers had trouble doing.  Simply put, there are more (and better) jokes in just about any one of the better Bugs Bunny shorts (e.g. What's Opera Doc?, Rabbit of Seville) than there is in Emperor's New Groove.  In fact, the only jokes I laughed out loud with were the repeated shoulder angel scenes and the reaction the villain and the Emperor have to Cronk talking to his shoulders (but even that was merely a one-step-farther parody of an over-used Looney Tunes gag).This is an annoying change in direction that I hope Disney will not continue--Disney has been far too interested in comedy lately instead of character and story.  Even the old Disney shorts (such as the Sorcerer's Apprentice piece from Fantasia) usually had a certain character depth that Warner Bros. cartoons often lacked (they relied on neat sight gags and movie parodies).Worst of all, the animation is only so-so.  There is absolutely no depth to the world they have created--no interesting camera angles or neat little touches like animals or insects or shafts of light or anything.  The backgrounds are just there, instead of the characters reacting to the backgrounds as if they're in that world (for examples of location depth, take a look at My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, or Bambi).  If I remember right, only a few scenes even shaded the characters according to the background (i.e. darker in forests or in buildings, much brighter when in the sun, spots of light that come in between leaves, etc.).  The characters are animated very smoothly, but occasionally suffer from the previously mentioned Looney Tunes syndrome.Eisner, I've made this plea before please making important chases/ decisions/growth spurts/training sequences into quick-cut musical montages.  There is nothing that takes me out of a movie quicker, and there's no excuse for doing so in animation.Seriously, man, this is sillier than Oliver and Company.

Spade's failure was reinforced by the worst screenplay I've seen in a very long time.  Tired cliches stood in for good dialogue, modern-day speech and expressions simply have no place in a movie set during the Inca heyday in South America, and the sight gags were nothing more than recycled vaudeville routines that work well in live-action, but fall flat here.While I was glad that Disney got away from the usual song-and-dance routine as well as the stupid comic-relief characters that are stock features of its animated films, I wouldn't recommend the direction that 'New Groove' took. The storyline had great promise, and the voices of John Goodman and Eartha Kitt worked very well, but David Spade and the writing team combined to ruin a good idea.  Disney wanted to make a slap-stick comedy, but I fear all the studio really succeeded in doing was making itself a laughing-stock.

The characters are dull, the plot is pointless, the animation is sub-par, and the music feels like it was slashed to ribbons.  You thought Tarzan was dull?  You ain't seen nothing yet.The basic story involves a selfish amoral emperor (David Spade) who is turned into a llama.  The movie is a bit of a quest picture as the emperor tries to get himself restored to human form.At the end of the picture we have a selfish amoral emperor who has, as far as I can tell, done *nothing* worth being restored.  There's certainly no moral lesson here, or at least not a good one.There are a few good jokes, though most of these are well over the average child's head.  The voice talents are good, as both Spade and Goodman deliver their dialog in a believable, in character manner.  Eartha Kitt is quite good as the evil Sorceress Yzma.  In fact, the voice talent, I think, is better than most Disney films of recent memory (with the exception of the Toy Story movies, quite possibly the best).  This is not enough to save a movie that I found to be predictable, silly, overblown, and, in the end, empty.  Somewhat like eating a snow cone.  There's some flavor, but no body.My 3 year old son likes it, but then again he's three.

Kronk (Yzma's beefcake boyfriend), voiced by Patrick Warburton, was the best part of the movie.  This film could have been a great deal more than it was, but it was just a faint, tinny echo of great what-if films, like It's a Wonderful Life.  It seems better suited to be a fill-in Saturday morning cartoon, than a feature film.

In the end it just comes off as being totaly lame.The animation is fine, it's a typical Disney story, but it's atempts to generate laughs will only work on someone under the age of maybe 6.  The film is not entertaining and comes across as Disney trying to be 'hip' and 'with it' like the crazy ingenious animation of other studios.  Nice try..  get original.Didn't work guys... ecspecially when you pick an annoying David Spade that doesn't help either.Rating 4 out of 10.

How can the ho hum animation of E.N.G. compare to the breath-taking visual experience of the Lion King or the Little Mermaid?  It saddens me to see that Disney chooses to churn out mediocre pap when I know they are capable of much, much more.  What happened to the magic in the Magic Kingdom?

I realize that all film makers are adults, but there is a certain class that have a horrible frame of reference for what they think is cute or clever or whatever.  This story is about a wretched character who really doesn't change that much in what is supposed to be his life changing crises.  He is immoral at the beginning and immoral at the end.  The jokes are crude and unfunny.  The characterizations are racial at best.  Greed and stupidity can be the only reasons for making movies like this.

The movie was very poorly written. The contemporary atmosphere in a historical setting was too much of a rip-off of any time travel film. Some of it's jokes were so lame I could barf. Then the writers took two shots at gay people. It's people like that I can't stand at all. And this was a family film, so they were trying to preach hate to children. May I ask why? Just because they have a different sexuality than the writers? Think about it sometime. Anywho, the animation wasn't too good either. Disney is supposed to have a reputation for constantly changing the art of animation, yet they have to use the techniques used in the Scooby-Doo shows back in the 80's.

The simplified animation, smarmy campiness, and attempts to appear relevant fall completely flat in this Disney animated feature.  This tired tale of enlightenment might be excusable if there was anything fresh or entertaining along the way.  The art is quite different from typical Disney fare, probably due to an accelerated production schedule.  In any case it's a step down in that department as well.   Perhaps young children, at least those who enjoy any and all cartoons, will find something of value here.   Everyone else steer clear. 2/10 "},{"Title":"Disney's worst since Hunchback","Date":"22 November 2001","Score":"2 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","Review":"  Boring, dull and annoying. People have said that movie is non-stop laughs, chuckles and guffaws. Well, all we can say is that they must have seen the humor un-cut version, then, 'cause we didn't even feel like smiling until one part about 3/4 the way through the movie! And even then, it was only a brief chortle. This movie tries hard to be like a Warner Brothers cartoon and fails. It's a cartoonish series of bad slapstick and anachronistic on-liners that seemingly builds upon the previous dud time-warped Hercules (which looks like a classic compared to this).Disney should stick to what it does best and leave the faddish stuff to companies with less of a reputation to lose. 1 out of 10 (for that brief scene with Yzma being whacked like a pinata) "}]
