[{"Title":"Chevy's Best Film","Date":"22 February 2005","Score":"39 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" I realize that comedy is subjective and things that I think are funny others may not think is too funny. But I am dumbstruck at some of the negative reviews for Funny Farm. Far and away this is Chevy's best film. I think the screenplay is beautifully written with so many small touches of humor hidden within a scene that to list them would take forever. I will agree that the last act takes a bit of a wide turn in reality but it doesn't stray so far that the film goes off track.The main story is your typical fish out of water story but what person can't identify with Chase's Andy Farmer in one way or another? Of course the film takes it to the extreme and it's all the funnier for it. And the characters are a biting reminder that not everyone is normal or sane for that matter. The waitress who serves lamb fries without explaining what that really is until it is desperately too late. The sheriff who has to take a cab because he flunked his driver's test. The mailman who throws the mail to the road because he is drunk by the time he reaches the Farmer's residence.And the small touches? How about the dog that runs away from home just after being brought home for the first time? Or the umpire whose strike zone is a bit wide. The odd fate of Claude Musselman? And let's not forget the phone operator who can tell the sound of two pennies being dropped in a jar but fails to realize it's not a pay phone Chase is calling from? I laughed hard and often which is something odd for me in any film with Chevy Chase. In all the years with all of his films I can honestly say I have only enjoyed five of them (Foul Play, Vacation, Fletch, Christmas Vacation and this one. That's right I am not a fan of Caddyshack)and this is his best.One more small moment sums up the film's humor for me. Chase is fishing with some men he has just met. One of them men gets a hook stuck in his neck. Instead of trying to pull it out Chase thinks it easier to knock the man out so THEN they can pull the hook out. After punching the man three times in the face one of the other men finally steps in and says You're not knocking him out, you're only beating the p*ss out of him.

From the ads (if you can even remember that far back!) this looked like it was just going to be a Vacation rip-off, sort of The Griswolds Move To the Country. Believe me, the humor in this film is much slyer and more charming than anything in the Vacation pictures (of which the first one was solid, the next two lame). The film is about a sportswriter (Chase) who quits his job in order to move out to the country with his wife (the wonderful Madolyn Smith) and write the Great American Novel. The movie details his gradual come uppance, as he realizes that neither country living nor his talent is all that it's cracked up to be.The film wonderfully skews the convention of the innocent country rubes moving to the big city and being overwhelmed by its meanness and craziness. Here, it's the cityfolk who move wide-eyed to the country - and are amazed to find there a roll call of crazies, misanthropes, and just plain wierdos. Does this view of country life have any basis in reality? Probably not, but then the film isn't really trying to be a satire but instead a pure lunatic comic fantasy. And it gives us a rich array of supporting characters - from the town sheriff who hasn't yet passed his driving test and so must ride around in cabs, to the owner of an antiques store whose merchandise are all personal. All these characters are priceless, and the film just keeps coming up with more and more of them - until it has created this pleasantly bizarre and warped Otherworld, of a kind that only comedy can truly provide.Best of all is the way in which Chase and Smith react to all of this and try to make some sense of it. I very clearly say Chase and Smith because the film belongs equally to both of them. It had to be billed as a Chevy Chase Comedy, of course, since he's the big star here, but this is no star trip; from the very first, the wife is made an equal partner in the trials and the laughs, and it's the way the two go through their new life together that provides much of the comedy. It also helps take the edge off of the usual Chevy Chase persona in Funny Farm he's neither glib and disinterested (as in the Fletch movies) nor over the top silly (like in the Vacation movies). He comes across instead like a normal, personable guy who just finds himself caught in insane circumstances.Finally, the climactic sequence of the film is absolutely priceless - one of the most brilliantly sustained comic set-pieces you'll see in any movie, of any era. Funny Farm is the type of movie which gives you a great time and leaves you with a big, dopey grin on your face after it's all over. Trust me, even if you don't normally like Chevy Chase, you'll love Funny Farm.

The script in intelligent, his co star, Madolyn Smith, is wonderful and she and Chase have fantastic chemistry. The plot involves Andy and Elizabeth Farmer (get it?) who move from the city to small town Vermont so that he can write a book. They plan to start a family, but first, they have to get used to the eccentric people they are surrounded by. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times, and I still laugh out loud. We just bought the DVD (had the VHS but sold it a while back), and we're having fun introducing this hilarious movie to our kids. They love it too!

Here they are  1.) I love the scenery in the movie--Vermont, four distinct seasons, gorgeous Cape Cod house.  2.) I love and can totally relate to the story line.  When I first saw this movie, I was in college and playing tennis on the tennis team.  We traveled to a city where EVERYTHING went wrong--and, the people were just plain weird.  I saw this movie, and I totally empathized with Andrew and Elizabeth Farmer!  3.) The humor in this movie is not over the top as it is with some of Chevy Chase's other films--everything is believable, and it's all very funny.  4.) I want a yellow dog!!!  The yellow labrador in this movie will make you want one of your own!  My only complaint with this film  The DVD version is not in Widescreen, and there are no special features.  But, for $5.88 in the Wal-Mart cheap bin, YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.  This is an excellent movie to watch over and over again.

Our tourist town is located on a Channel Island in the Pacific, but the characters couldn't be more identical to those Chevy and wife deals with in the rural town they move to for serenity and quiet.  Everyone tests their resolve to live in that community, and in failing to measure up to their standards, they are treated as outsiders.  Once they understand the neighborhood peculiarities, everyone becomes acquainted, then accustomed to one another. While finding a common bond and learning to fit in, there is one silly misadventure after another.  There are a lot of laughs in this movie that allow a person to stand back and realize that this is how small communities conduct themselves everywhere, and is a study in human behavior.  Chevy's characters rarely make anything easy, which combined with a seemingly conservative personality has become his calling card.

There is a fair amount of good laughs and an entertaining story, but not as great as some of Chevy's other credits.Chevy Chase does a fine job with his role, playing a very similar character to most of his other films.  Chevy is good at what he does and doesn't seem to stray very far from what works.  Madolyn Smith-Osborne is fantastic in the film, looking just gorgeous and playing her role very well.  The only other actors that were familiar to me were the movers in the beginning of the film, Mike Starr and Glen Plummer.  Both actors do a fine job, although very small roles in the film.If you are a fan of Chevy Chase, then I'd recommend seeing this film, you'll probably enjoy it.  But, if Chevy Chase isn't your cup of tea, then this may not be the film for you.  In any case, if you do see it, I hope you enjoy it.

Films like Spies Like Us, Nothing But Trouble and Funny Farm have went largely unseen since the advent of DVD in 1997. Neither of these movies have received widescreen releases and have been out of print for years. I was beginning to wonder what Warner had against giving them definitive releases until I discovered an HD master of Funny Farm on the PlayStation Network.I saw it only once, when I was about 9, and remembered very little. If you're a fan of Clark Griswold then Andy Farmer isn't too far removed. Andy is a sports journalist who retires from the big city to the Redbud, Vermont hoping to enjoy and idyllic, peaceful life and finally write the great, American novel (The Big Heist). When he gets there he and his wife discover that almost everyone and everything is weirder than the last. There are giant snakes in their pond, a dead body buried in their garden, a Sheriff who can't drive, a crazy mailman and a town who basically hate them. And top of all this Andy has severe writer's block while his wife manages to churn out a successful children's novel without really trying.With careful, measured direction from George Roy Hill (Butch Cassidy, The Sting) Funny Farm, based on a novel by Jay Cronley, manages to be a little classier than Chase's usual fare. This makes the lack of a home video version even more puzzling. It has never been released on DVD in the UK, and the 1989 VHS is long gone. If you have access to the PlayStation Network then go for it. I have a funny feeling that Funny Farm and Spies Like Us will probably be released as a Warner Blu Ray Double Feature in the near future, but nothing has been announced so far.Don't let the mistreatment of this film put you off, it lives up to it's title and is the perfect vehicle for Chevy Chase and his goofy humour.

One can't stop , while the other can barely move . The small town has also few interesting characters  crazy postman , teenagers stealing road signs , weird old lady from antique shop. There is nice love/hate/love relationship between Chase and Smith . In the end the movie kinda becomes a little Christmas movie.Overall it's a very pleasant movie .

But, he and his lovely wife, Elizabeth (Madolyn Smith) long for a quiet life, away from the rat race. So, when Andy pitches an idea for a novel to a major publisher and receives an advance, they quit their jobs and buy a home in rural New England. Stopping for a picnic on the way to their new home, they take photographs of cows and wax lyrical about their coming good fortune. However, once in the town of Redbud, things do not go as planned. First, the movers get lost and are so irritated and tired by the time they arrive at the Farmers' house, they pitch Andy's desk chair into a nearby pond. Then, Andy and Elizabeth's new mail carrier is a maniac who drives by their place every day, going 70 mph and flinging their mail into the yard. Huh. Andy's first attempt at fishing his own pond results in the capture of a big black snake, which wraps around Andy's shoulders, while Elizabeth digs up a coffin, complete with a corpse, in the couple's garden. From their runaway dog to the horrid dinners served at the local diner to a major writers' block that consumes Andy, will they last the winter? This wonderfully funny film is a great entertainment choice for the proverbial bad day. The script is very humorous, with a bevy of terrific one-liners. Case in point, when the movers arrive at a rickety bridge, one of them wails that that's not a bridge, that's a bunch of termites holding hands! Yes, that's one phrase, but the film sports quite a few of them. The cast, mostly unknowns, are great, with the star, Chase, on top of his game and Smith complimenting him nicely. The scenery in olde New England is lovely while the costumes and other movie niceties are top-notch. George Roy Hill's direction, too, is fast and fresh. If you are searching for surefire laughs at the end of a rough day, you could hardly do better than this little flick. Although it has no grandiose aspirations, it is grand entertainment indeed.

The premise is very simple, Chase and his wife, the wonderful Madolyn Smith, are city dwellers who moved to the country where they find life to be filled with misadventure. They also find that their new town is filled with rather eccentric people and curious cuisines. The script is smarter than typical SNL alumni comedy, the cinematography and the pacing of the movie is right on the money. If there is one major shortcoming it is the casting of Chevy Chase. James Stewart in Mr Hobbs takes a Vacation hit the right notes for this type of character, an average man somewhat overwhelmed by his new and foreign environment, but Mr. Chase does not. It doesn't help that many of Mr. Chase's earlier characters were smart alecks surrounded by dullards. Here it's the opposite. Fans of Mr. Chase will not like this because he's not playing the character he's known for playing. Non fans will simply think a better actor who can play the average guy like Tom Hanks or Robert Hays (who was still somewhat well known at the time) would have made the movie much better.

But some punks stole the sign that pointed to where the movers were supposed to turn so they drove right past it. Andy and Elizabeth soon make it to their new home. It's just beautiful! There's a pond there with ducks. The movers meanwhile ask for directions twice and got no help. They then tried crossing the river on a rickety old bridge, which begins to break as they drive over it. They immediately back out just in time to see it collapse into the river. Night fell and the movers still didn't show up but they did the next morning. Apparently the map they were given was all screwed up. Andy says he's the one who drew it so the movers toss his desk chair into the pond. But soon everything was unpacked and placed in the house. Andy began on his novel while Elizabeth did some gardening. Andy got writer's block at the beginning of chapter one and Elizabeth unearthed a coffin! They try calling the sheriff but the old biddy operators were no help. But they finally get through and the sheriff identifies the deceased as the previous owner of the house.         Andy and Elizabeth venture into the town of Redbud. Andy goes to a ball game and ends up going fishing while Elizabeth visits an antique store. Sheriff Ledbetter arrives then and presents her the funeral bill they gave the body they found in her yard. It was $4.000! Andy ripped it up. Since they couldn't make any friends, Andy decided to buy one a dog, which ran away as soon as they returned home; Andy continued on his novel and Elizabeth got inspired to write a book as well. Soon the night of their anniversary arrived. Elizabeth's gift to Andy was a new dog Yellow Dog. It didn't move when she held it, leaving Andy to inquire as to if it were dead. (Funny scene!) Then they go to dinner where Andy loses his appetite when he learns what lamb fries are. Finally, they check into a motel where Andy gives Elizabeth his present his novel. She doesn't like it so he tosses it into the fire and immdiately retrieves it. Back at the house, Elizabeth finishes her book. It's a children's book and the main character is a squirrel named Andy. Andy grew jealous that Elizabeth was doing a better job writing-wise than he was. One day he was visited by a publisher, Michael Sinclair, who asked for the $10,000 advance his company had given Andy since Andy had turned in nothing, but Andy ran back to the house to give Michael his novel, but it was damaged by the fire so he gave him Elizabeth's manuscript. When Elizabeth found out what Andy had done, she was very angry. She moved out and wanted a divorce. Neither of them wanted the house, so Andy had an idea.       He called a town meeting and requested everybody's help in selling the house. Everyone refused to help until Andy threw a little money their way $15,000 to the town and $50 for everyone who participated. Everyone then agreed and soon the Culbertsons came to look over the house. It was at the Christmas season so the townspeople sang carols and were very festive. Pretty soon, the Culbertsons made Andy an offer, but both he and Elizabeth had decided they didn't want to sell the house or get a divorce. The Culbertsons leave infuriated. There was worse to come Andy told the townspeople he would be unable to pay them the $50 he promised them so they threw snowballs at him. Epilogue Elizabeth wrote two more books, Andy became a sportswriter for the Redbud Gazette and donated money to the softball field.       A pretty good movie. Pretty funny. Saturday Night Live's Chevy Chase is here and he's funny. Madolyn Smith-Osbourne was good too. Other performances from Jack Gilpin, Mike Starr, Kevin O'Morrison and Glenn Plummer.

Mired in the Clark Griswold mode since the Vacation films, he continues playing the grinning, klutzy upbeat kinda guys.  Here he takes his wife to the country in the hopes of a serene, nature filled lifestyle.  Of course, the two big city folk get a dose of hell as they find out the town is laden with oddballs.  There's the mailman who chucks the mail out the window without stopping and the sheriff who is chauffered around because of a flunked driver's test.  Back at home there are snakes in the lake and plenty of cheap laughs generated by one of those half doors, where the top opens but the bottom remains shut, causing some mishaps (i.e., Chase slamming into the knob with his groin).  The only laugh out loud moment came during the disgustingly tasteless (and I mean that literally) lamb fry scene.  Those who know the film should know what I'm talking about.  It was yet another way to get an easy laugh, but I still busted up.  But even though the film lacks hard laughs and only has mostly chuckles, I still was able to get through it easy enough.  I somehow was engrossed by the dueling writers subplot, where Chase's wife outshines him by selling a manuscript.  The ending was ok, if uneventful.  The supporting cast is good, but nobody to really make you smile as they're mostly angry scowlers.  Chase pulls off the hopeful dope and too bad about Smith-Osborne, a very attractive actress who disappeared after this.  I saw her in a Cheers epsisode a year later and the Joe Pesci film The Super in '91, but aside from that she vanished. Kind of a shock that screenwriter Boam (who I guess adapted the novel for this film) would go on to pen Lethal Weapon 2 a year later.  So, for a lazy afternoon laugh, check this out.

However the Chase vehicle Funny Farm is a pleasurable film I could watch over and over again, never tiring of it. That's true because whenever it's on TV, it would go on to that channel for some lazy entertainment. This is how I saw 'Funny Farm', because while it's all familiar it's well done and holds a very cozy, easy going charm to its screwy antics. Never does it truly go over-board, as it lets the story slowly tick by, but however after the hour mark it does begin to lose steam. As city-dwellers Andy (a picture-perfect Chevy Chase) and Elizabeth Farmer (a tremendously savvy Madolyn Smith) leave their stable careers behind to move to the country to get away from the bustle, but they go on to find out their dreams are turning out to be one disastrous mishap after another in a very unconventional little town causing a strain on their relationship.The performances are excellent from those involved. Chase appealingly milks out the humour, and the lovely Smith (a talent who seemed to have a short career) works off him terrifically. Mike Starr and Glen Plummer were fun in their short roles of removal men. Joseph Maher is good and Kevin Conway has a very amusing cameo.George Roy Hill's direction is uneven, but bouncy holding together all the diversions and incorporating in the picturesque country backdrop with the scenic photography. Elmer Bernstein's music playfully lively. Jeffrey Boam's witty, likable screenplay (taken off Jay Cronley's novel) is well timed and smartly penned, even if the gags are continuously repeated, but there's a real sense of community (an oddball one) staged.A wondrously admirable homegrown comedy with its heart in the right place.

Funny Farm has a hilarious sequence in which our hero, Mr. Chase, discovers he is eating something which is a local delicacy that may not be served on dinner plates at his home or anywhere else for that matter. Similar subject matter has been done many times before, including Chase's own National Lampoon's Vacation series. Chase started out as a witty actor who shined on SNL and in movies, like Foul Play but his persona was beomcing a tired one when he made this film. He is now someone whose career is at a virtual standstill so much so that no one cares if he is at a Lakers game or not. But, considering Chase has made films like Modern Problems and Deal of the Century one could say this average film is not as awful as many of his other films, though it certainly doesn't rank with his best films like Fletch. For Hill, he was simply a great director. Alas, his final film does him no justice.

Here, it's the cityfolk who move wide-eyed to the country - and are amazed to find there a roll call of crazies, misanthropes, and just plain wierdos. Does this view of country life have any basis in reality? Probably not, but then the film isn't really trying to be a satire but instead a pure lunatic comic fantasy. And it gives us a rich array of supporting characters - from the town sheriff who hasn't yet passed his driving test and so must ride around in cabs, to the owner of an antiques store whose merchandise are all personal. All these characters are priceless, and the film just keeps coming up with more and more of them - until it has created this pleasantly bizarre and warped Otherworld, of a kind that only comedy can truly provide.Best of all is the way in which Chase and Smith react to all of this and try to make some sense of it. I very clearly say Chase and Smith because the film belongs equally to both of them. It had to be billed as a Chevy Chase Comedy, of course, since he's the big star here, but this is no star trip; from the very first, the wife is made an equal partner in the trials and the laughs, and it's the way the two go through their new life together that provides much of the comedy. It also helps take the edge off of the usual Chevy Chase persona in Funny Farm he's neither glib and disinterested (as in the Fletch movies) nor over the top silly (like in the Vacation movies). He comes across instead like a normal, personable guy who just finds himself caught in insane circumstances.Finally, the climactic sequence of the film is absolutely priceless - one of the most brilliantly sustained comic set-pieces you'll see in any movie, of any era.

Now a few thoughts on this movie! I'm not a Chevy Chase fan but I became a usage fan of the Lovely Madolyn Smith Osborne. As far as I'm concern she was the one that made this movie worth watching. Therefore, I'm giving the movie 10 weasel stars based on Madolyn and Madolyn only.

Chevy Chase plays Andy Farmer, who chooses to quit his job and move to a country home in Vermont so that he can write a novel.The first hour of the movie is almost a parody of Chevy's brilliant role as Clark W. Griswald,in the original Vacation film. There are some very funny scenes involving movie day, a fishing trip, a dog, and a snake. However, there is not enough good quality writing in the script to make FUNNY FARM particularly worthwhile or memorable.Credit must be given to Chevy for doing his best. But it is a shame that in FUNNY FARM he didn't have a better script. The movie's first half has its moments without question. However, the last half-hour is void of any humorous material as the film tries to take on a more serious tone. A Christmas holiday theme is brought into the story without any build up and the ending is much too pat as the townspeople forgive Chevy for all of the unintentional trouble he caused, (for the most part.) Chevy and his wife decide to stay in the country.Considering the talents of director George Roy Hill (i.e The Sting, The Great Waldo Pepper--director) this is a major disappointment. What made Chevy's role so wonderful in Vacation, was the superb comic chemistry between the characters and a fun story all the way through. FUNNY FARM'S writers just seem to say, Well, Chevy was SOOOOO good in Vacation, that we will give him some traditional bit jokes that worked great in that movie, and take on a feel good Christmas holiday storyline at the end, when the jokes are finished.The main problem with FUNNY FARM is that there is not a strong enough story line with quality humor to sustain viewer interest throughout the film. FUNNY FARM starts funny at the premise, but falls apart by the conclusion.

Remember when he used to be funny. I don't either, I was just a little boy. Anyways, Funny Farm is just an average comedy. You snicker in some places, some lines and situations are funny, but Chase has done much better in the past. The mostly no name cast fleshes out the movie with no humor living all the comedic duties up to Chevy. He lets us down. I have this movie in my collection, I don't know why. We've all done things that we're not proud of. Bottom Line Look at Funny Farm for what it is, an average 80's comedy, and you might enjoy it. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it though.

While he's pretty much the same Chevy in Funny Farm and very funny in deed at times, the whole movie just didn't work out for me.Funny Farm is somewhat more restrained, wry and maybe even boring compared to other Chevy Chase movies. There's nothing really wrong with the movie (unless maybe the last act is a bit of an u-turn), everything works as should, direction is quite tight. It's quite difficult to say what's wrong, even tho it's a lot of fun, it lacks the warmth and engagement of most Chevy Chase movies. I really see this primarily as a Chevy Chase movie.While the leading lady did a pretty good job acting the part, I never thought she really fit the role. She just didn't have the Beverly D'Angelo kind of warmth I expected. I didn't feel the connection between Chevy and her wife. Also the lack of children made the movie seem a bit serious, even tho it had all the elements of a family comedy.George Roy Hill did a great job portraying the dry humour in Slap Shot, one of my all time favourite movies. To my mind his dryish humour worked much better in the bleak and wintery scenes of factory towns rather than beautiful Vermont. And don't get me wrong, the scenery and set deco are really nice to look at.Good pastime, but I don't see myself returning to this title for some time.

However, there is only sporadic humour here because not all of the gags actually work; as such, it cannot really be considered funny now can it? The plot revolves around Andy Farmer (Funny 'Farm'. How ironic) and his partner, who, sick of the city life, move to the country life, where 'unexpected' and 'humorous' pratfalls ensue for our couple. I don't know why, but this all sounds awfully clichéd and familiar.Anyway, I put 'humorous' in inverted commas because not much of what happens in this movie is particularly humorous, or at least not as much so as it could have been. Even the gags which do work, i.e, Chevy Chase eating lambs testicles (don't ask), or the dog running off as soon as he returns to the Farmer residence, aren't particularly memorable. The main gags, such as Chevy Chase constantly pursuing a postman, or Chase taking revenge on his wife by publishing her novel, aren't particularly funny and end in an anticlimax. This cookie-cutter comedy is 'complimented' by the clichéd sentimental ending.'Funny Farm' was obviously made just because Chevy Chase was available. It's not a terrible film, but it's very much mediocre. As such, I find it hard to recommend just because it has too little 'funny' in it. If you are not a Chevy Chase fan, don't bother seeing this.2/5 stars "},{"Title":"A city couple moves to the country.","Date":"7 May 2000","Score":"3 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Chevy Chase plays Andy Farmer, a frustrated writer, who moves with his wife, Elizabeth, to a farm in Vermont. Nothing seems to go the way the couple expected. The Farmer's bribe the township into creating a Norman Rockwell persona in order to sell the farm and return to New York.This movie is more stupid than funny. Pathetic jokes that keep falling flat and missing their mark. Jay Cronley's novel was done a disservice. Madolyn Smith-Osborne holds her own with what she has to work with. This is no where near the caliber of Chase's vacation movies.

This is BY FAR his worst movie. My all time favorite is Vacation with Christmas Vacation and European Vacation tied for second. I didn't especially like Vegas Vacation but even that seems like a classic compared to this garbage. Not crazy about the Fletch movies but they are better than this. I know Roger Ebert gave this dull movie 3 and 1/2 stars but I wonder if we were watching the same movie.My least favorite before this was Three Amigos but that is better than Funny Farm. Caddy Shack was a good movie but Chase's role was trounced by Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Bill Murray. Chase almost ruined that movie if you ask me, and he was the weakest comedian of the 4. When Chase is too laid back like in Caddysahck and Funny Farm, he is not funny.Talk about milking a character to death. The Saturday Night Live persona Chase created would only stretch so far. I would rather watch paint dry than ever watch this dud of a movie again.

Unfortunately, poor choices for moving the story along doom this one to being an unmemorable mediocre comedy. Still, there are some laughs to be had in this film about a couple who move to the country with rather disastrous results. Most of the more funny scenes though occur at the beginning of the film, as the film progresses though it becomes more and more bland. Chevy's character is a writer who once he arrives in the country develops a rather bad case of writer's block. This initially interesting and led to a funny scene involving a singing bird. However, this is also what ends up shooting the film down in flames as this leads to a dispute between Chevy's character and his wife. A very unfunny set of scenes that set the movie into even less funny scenes as they decide to sell their newly acquired home. Still, the scene involving the couple going to the restaurant, the scene involving them trying to get a dog and the scene about the fishing trip are funny and make the movie rise to a bit higher level before the second half of the movie sort of crashes the movie down.

At that time it has been aired on a Sunday afternoon and I can remember that I really disliked the movie because there where only bad jokes and the story was kind of strange. Last year I watched the movie again because I heared that Sarah Michelle Gellar played in the movie and then I realised that the movie is only for little kids! I think no grown up would watch this movie and that's not typical for a Chevy Chase film. e.g. take Spys like us. That movie was funny and did not contain any childish gags.

Never one to balk at a mystery, I sat down with my old pal IMDb to figure out why I had such an aversion to this movie when everything about this movie should add up to being a 10-star masterpiece for my tastes. Here are things I really love in movies, and that this movie has1. Chevy Chase2. Light/slapstick comedy 3. 80s comedy 4. Fish-out-of-water story 5. living the dream plot 6. I can relate to it (we moved city-to-farm in real life) 7. Animal/outdoor humor 8. Beautiful settingThis should be the perfect movie for me. So what on earth is it that makes me so reluctant to like this movie? I finally figured it out I don't actually LIKE any of the characters - everyone in this movie seemed so very mean spirited and just plain grumpy. There really wasn't anyone to root for at all. I didn't care whether they stayed in the town, stayed married, moved away, got divorced, or even abducted by aliens and never seen again 2/3 of the way through the movie? I really like movies that allow me to enjoy and feel for the characters - this one was very VERY lacking in that department.I'm glad I finally figured it out. Next time I pull that VHS off the shelf, I hope to remember exactly why I should put it right back up again.

It's fun and beautiful here--not much money, not surprisingly--and the people are as nice and decent as you can imagine. I also noticed that the credits don't mention any of the locations--maybe they felt guilty or were afraid of a lawsuit!Here's some extra trivia the gazebo in the Townshend town square featured throughout Funny Farm was a specially-constructed prop. After the crew left, the townspeople liked it so much that they had a more substantial one built on the same site. This was told to me by my local barber, and he knows everything! The gazebo and square can often be seen on the back of Vermont Life magazine. "}]
