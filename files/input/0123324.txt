The smart screenplay revolves around the court battle of Lymon's three wives (yes, three!) over song royalties, leading to vivid (and often humorously contradictory) flashbacks of their lives with the singer.  Larenz Tate is magnetic playing the many different sides of the ever-changing lead character, but the film ultimately belongs to Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon as the wives.  Each is allowed to shine as the trio portrays 30 years of changes in the women's lives, with Fox drop-dead hilarious as the most outrageous of the three. There's beautifully detailed '60s-era cinematography, sets, costuming and musical numbers, plus a side-splitting turn by Miguel Nunez as a young Little Richard. Major issues (such as '60s race relations) are barely glanced at, but what this film lacks in depth, it makes up for ten-fold in entertainment value. A winner!

Larenz Tate isn't entirely convincing as Frankie Lymon--I guess they just cast him because he's real short.  The concert scenes and TV appearances where he sings are noticeably lip-synched and look pretty cheesy.  But acting-wise Tate did a fine job.  Obviously, they didn't really delve into his drug addiction, to keep with its light-hearted feel.  So we don't get to experience the heavy drama of Lymon's short life.  The actresses were good--Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon.  Their performances were equally effective and amusing.  The great Little Richard has some spirited cameos.  He definitely brought the mood of the film to an all-time high.  I just wish he could've been in it for longer than 10 minutes.  The whole movie basically concentrates on the romantic-comedy portions of Lymon's life--some true, some fabricated.  There were some dramatic moments, but they occur mostly towards the end.  But I got a lot of laughs and the film just has a fitfully satisfying upbeat tone.  Of course, I LOVED the music.  I have to admit that was one of the main reasons I enjoyed it so much.  Why Do Fools Fall in Love is a moderately loose portrayal of Lymon's life, but it makes great entertainment.     "},{"Title":"Clever and entertaining. (SPOILERS ENCLOSED)","Date":"26 March 2004","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  Why Do Fools Fall In Love is an unexpected gem. In the previews it looks like a movie-of-the-week bio of a long dead celebrity, but this is actually a carefully crafted, well acted and visually fascinating film. With films that claim to be based on actual events, it is important to consider that those events have been interpreted by a writer, director, and actors. Whether this film accurately portrays events in the life of 1950's singing sensation Frankie Lymon is immaterial to the success if the film. The fact remains, whether truthful or fictional, the film is interesting to look at, entertainingly written, and cleverly constructed.Director Gregory Nava has sculpted the film into a richly intertwined series of flashbacks, reminiscences and moments out of pop history. The performance scenes, where we see Frankie Lymon before an audience, either as a raw kid or as a fading icon, are wonderfully integral to the story, and not just blatant rationalization of the sound track cd on sale soon at music stores everywhere. Nava allows the innate energy of the music to flow into the film through lively editing, camera movement, colourful setting and costume. Particularly interesting are the long continuous Steadycam shots and the processing of footage to look like old home movies or 1950's live TV images.Larenz Tate (The Postman) made an explosive impact early in his career with his role of O-Dog in Menace II Society, and then excelled on the short lived TV series South Central. Here, he is considerably reigned in either by the film makers, or by his own sense of how Lymon should be played. His performance, although capable, seems shallow at times and never really delivers any insight to what makes the man tick. The film makers knew that the strength of the story was in the perspective given it by the three women who each claim to be Lymon's widow and entitled to a share in his estate. The character of Lymon, as seen from these different points of view, is at times childishly naive, brutally malicious or tremendously generous and unselfish.The film's best performance is from Vivica A. Fox (Booty Call, Independence Day) who plays Lymon's `first' wife Elisabeth Waters. Fox mixes a wry intelligence with a crude and unpolished demeanor to portray the woman who so loves Lymon in the decline of his career, that she will work as a prostitute to pay for his drug rehabilitation in a private clinic. The tragic irony of her pouring so much of herself into Lymon's empty shell is that she survives the giving while he can never find what he needs in the taking.The two other wives are played very ably by Halle Berry (Bulworth) who appears as Zola Taylor of The Platters and Lela Rochon (Waiting To Exhale) as Emira Eagle. Zola is attracted by Lymon's talent and charisma and is so won over by his sincerity and her own belief in his character that she allows him to destroy all that she has earned as he destroys himself. Emira is the wholesome, God-fearing school teacher who finds the committed romantic in Lymon and manages to help him settle into a simple domesticity for a time before the call of his lost celebrity takes him from her in a last attempt to reclaim his fame.The period detail is vivid and slides up and down a continuum that ranges from deliberately romanticized to unbearably sordid. The film makers have wisely avoided the trap of dwelling on Lymon's heroin addiction. There is very little portrayal of the actual use of drugs, just an examination of their effect on Lymon and on the lives the women who love him.

However, as the title indicates, it is really about three women who fell in love ... with a guy named Frankie Lyman.  As the movie brings home fairly early, there is not much about Frankie to love.  He is portrayed as a shallow, self-centered fool, with as little understanding of the music business as of the women he scams into being his wives.  Did Frankie have raw talent?  Of course he did.  Did Frankie do anything to develop this raw talent into an enduring musical career?  No evidence of that.  So much for Frankie.  Larenz Tate plays him fairly well on stage, and rather flat off stage.  We are not given a clue as to what the attraction may have been.And, since two of the women were relatively unaware of his celebrity status when they were first taken with him, and the third had a celebrity status of her own, we expect the movie to answer the title question.  The women do not entirely succeed in this, but they are terrifically watchable while they try.Halle Berry is great as Zola Taylor, singer with the Platters.  Viveca Fox is almost as good as the home girl who turns hooker to support Frankie,  and Lela Rachon is perfect as the goodie-two-shoes last wife, a God-fearing and educated working woman.The music scenes are good, and the courtroom scenes are outrageously unrealistic.  This would have been a better movie if they had not specifically based the story on Lyman, but only alluded to him.  In this manner, the Hollywoodization of the story would have been less noticeable.  Unfortunately, realizing that such a course would inevitably preclude using the Lyman hits, they chose to make this a triography of the wives, and allow them to play off Tate's weak Lyman persona.All in all, a good couple of hours of enjoyment that is not too compelling.  When it was over, we found ourselves asking, Why DID these three fools fall in love?

Teen idols fare the worst, and such was the fate of Frankie Lymon, who scored but three Top 20 hits between February 1956 and the summer of 1957 Why Do Fools Fall In Love, I Want You To Be My Girl (both with The Teenagers) and Goody Goody (as a soloist). After that, the industry and music buyers considered him to be yesterday's former fresh face. And, like most young teens who become overnight sensations, Frankie's firework-long popularity came to cripple him later as a) people would not accept him as anything other than a 13-year-old and b) he was utterly unprepared to cope with real life once his flash of fame had ended. An insightful peek into Frankie Lymon's mercurial life would have made a great movie -- but this isn't it. Instead, we get only a superficial look at Lymon, as the movie focuses instead on the three women who claimed to be his wife. Lymon does not deserve to be shoved into the background of his own biopic, especially as his story is representative of the rise and fall of many flash-in-the-pan artists who find themselves revered by the public one minute and then dumped into history's ashcan the next -- often before they really reach the summit of their skills. (Believe me -- as the writer of The History Of Rock 'n' Roll, I know this all too well.) The three women battling over his estate were more a footnote to his story than the real drama and far too much time is allocated to letting the three female leads each take a star turn. Yes, Zola Taylor was the best-known of the three, but she is portrayed following her run with The Platters as an in-the-money solo star headlining live shows with her giant hit Only You. Are the producers kidding? Zola Taylor didn't even JOIN The Platters until AFTER Only You had become a million-seller! The Platters scored big as the most successful hitmaking singing group of the late '50s (1955-9), despite the fact that the group was really lead vocalist Tony Williams -- with the others as mere background singers. (What were The Doors, for example, without Jim Morrison?) Zola only sang lead on a couple of minor Platters chart items -- and after leaving the act, immediately sank into near total obscurity. The Platters' golden era ended in 1960 after Tony left on his ill-fated solo career. (I explored this in great detail while assembling a 60-track Platters career retrospective 3-CD box set.) None of The Platters really made much money at all -- as they were mere salaried employees of their manager, Buck Ram. Ram wrote much of their material, told them what to sing and how, produced their records, owned The Platters' name and (no surprise) kept nearly all of the loot himself. The portrayal of Morris Levy, who owned several labels including Gee (the recording home of Lymon and The Teenagers) was pretty accurate. Not all record labels screwed artists as thoroughly as Levy's did, but his methods were none too unusual for the time. In fact, they're not much different than what the industry does today!

Fox). Loyal yet dishonest, gritty Elizabeth is the only character aside from Frankie that seems to be real. This is a combined effort by the characterisation and the performance by Fox.And Lela Rochon does very well cast against type, as a school marm dragged into this battle. Rochon clearly understands the character well, and manages to make her mark on the story despite being developed late into the film.The period detail of this piece is well captured over the 20-odd years that this story is set (particularly the performances of Frankie with the Teenagers), and even the small scenes which provide insight into Frankie's younger days.The main flaws of this film lie essentially in the struggle to develop some of the themes. As mentioned earlier, Frankie's reasons for bigamy are not established at all or how he copes this with this, or whether one of the wives in particular is lying about the legitimacy of her marriage.Some of the characterisation is a bit thin, caused by some of the later events of the film and because this deep story of fame, loss, betrayal and torment has such a muddled structure the whole film comes across as sketchy by the end which clearly was not intended.But never the less this is an adequate tribute, to the world of fame and its inevitable clingers-on, and those just caught up in the action. This will never be top of its genre however...

Larenz Tate does one hell of a job in the role of Frankie. His wives (Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox, Lela Rochon) are very good in their roles. An entertaining film that I wished was more in depth. A good start but it needs to be fleshed out some more. Maybe Mr. Nava should have focused more on the group when they were younger and rising through the top of the charts. A younger actor would have been helpful as well (Frankie Lymon was a small dude). But the film wasn't all that bad, they even showed us a side of Mr. Lymon I never even knew existed.

The film opens with three women arriving at Frankie's former manager's office after his death, trying to claim his estate, all claiming to be the legal widow of Lyman and it is during the trial to determine which of these ladies is Lyman's legal widow where Frankie's story unfolds. As with all movie biographies, you never know how much you're watching is based on fact and what has been enhanced or diluted for dramatic effect. In this screenplay, Frankie is a charismatic young singer, who apparently had no problem charming women out of their clothes and their money, the latter of which apparently went to support his drug habit. Frankie's drug use is somewhat glossed over and the screenplay tends to concentrate more on Frankie's manipulative ways with these three women and how he, at one time or another, managed to convince all three of them that there were the only women in the world. Baby-faced Larenz Tate plays Frankie with a sincerity and sexiness that possibly oversells Frankie's real womanizing, but he manages to keep Frankie likable despite some of the slimy things he does. The three women in Frankie's life are well played by Halle Berry, Viveca A. Fox, and Lela Rochon, with Fox a standout in probably the best performance of her career. The musical sequences are troublesome...Tate works hard at lip-syncing authentically, but I never bought the lip-syncing in the film...all of the musical sequences in the film come off sounding canned. Still, Tate and the ladies commit to their roles and do make the movie worth watching. I don't know how accurate the film is as a biography of Frankie Lyman, but it is a very entertaining film that will effortlessly hold interest.

This deprives one and all of seeing the simple true source of Frankie's problems. Too much fame, too fast and too young. Larenz Tate struggles with the role where he sometimes looks more like a young Sammy Davis than Frankie. The singing and dancing sequences are acceptable and Tate brings the music off adequately.The racial issues, which the film deals with, have some truth, but the details are inaccurate. In 1957 audiences in some venues were segregated, but in others were mixed and not a problem. The idea that this music helped end segregation is mentioned, but not really seen, except for the incredible scene of Frankie dancing with a white girl on 'The Big Beat'. This big surprise is very effectively handled and has major impact.I don't think Nava understands doo-wop or the relationship of the lead singer to the backups. There is a big difference between the Platters, essentially a white pop adultish Ink Spots type group and the Teenagers who were rock 'n' roll, appealing to those under 21. This just never comes across.Nava does do some clever things, pointed out in the director's cut (not recommended, way too 'Goody, Goody') as he uses a continuous roll camera to suck you in and wrap you around the scene he is filming.The attempts to stylize 'Fools' mostly works. The theme of creating the four main characters as Earth (Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle), Fire (Halle Berry as Zola Taylor), Water (Vivca Fox as Elizabeth Waters) as the 3 wives to play off Wind (Tate-Frankie) is clever and consistent. The use of scatchy 8MM flash backs is a bit over done, but gets the point of flashbacks across.All three of the parts of the wives suffer from being overly dramatic (and over acted)with the need to fit truth to the story, rather than the other way around.Most disturbing is the handling of Frankie's music. Its hard to tell his solo work from his Teenagers stuff and the sequencing of the music is out of order. At least Nava makes it clear Frankie was not a 'One hit wonder' and he had four years of outstanding singles and (not mentioned at all) some super albums, mostly as a solo. As one of the wives mentions, above all he could sing my panties off. If you don't think so, play Frankie's version of Why Do Fools Fall in Love followed by the weak, sad Diana Ross version.Next time Mr. Gregory Nava when doing an autobiography spend as much time keeping your facts straight and in order, as you do with clever stylization.Not recommended unless your a fan of any of the elements involved. Wanna a good music bio from more or less the same period and effectively dealing with drug addiction, watch Ray the magnificent Ray Charles story.

Fox, Lela Rochon, Larenz Tate, and Little Richard Director Gregory Nava    115 minutes    Rated R (for language, sexuality and thematic elements)Why Do Fools Fall In Love is a mostly pleasant, uplifting experience in the wonderful world of film. It is a memorable musical with tunes to remember and an atmosphere to be charmed by. Not only is this a good movie, but one worth the price of a theater ticket (even though it is now available on home video and DVD, and no longer at the multiplex). I liked it---and I recommend it!The film's title, Why Do Fools Fall In Love, comes from the name of a song sang by the 1950's rock and roll group called The Teenagers. A key member in that band is Frankie Lymon, who was 13 when he had his big record hit and 25 when he committed suicide. The record had success beyond imagination for his band. Propelling them into the world of greed, fame, and confusion as gradually their team began to break apart and turn on each other, causing Frankie to turn to a life of drugs, the army, and sex, with his wife, of course...but did I mention he had three of them.Why Do Fools Fall in Love tells the inspiring story of how musical legend Frankie Lymon married three separate women without any of them having any knowledge of the other. The movie does not tell its story through the eyes of Frankie Lymon, however, but with the three women who all claim to be the wife of the late Frankie Lymon squabbling in court over the estate Zola Taylor (Halle Berry) who is a glamorous singer with the Platters, Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox), a crook who supported him so much that she took he love to the extreme to pay the money in which needed to be used for his drug rehab, and Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon), a religious school teacher who was always there for him after he was part of the Army and sent to Georgia for training. They each argue that they deserve the four million that Frankie held in his estate.The premise is informational and well structured. We learn who the main characters are, what we are dealing with here, and a clear problem. Although the emotional view point of this film is constantly changing, making it hard to root for anyone in the cast, for a long period of time the emotional side of the story stands out of the picture, because most of the story is told through flashbacks of the Spouses, and when in trial, the emotional point of view varies from person to person, making any of the flashback scenes irrelevant. Yes, the subject madder of the film is a little ridiculous, but I think the point of view that the director chose to use here is quite effective, nonetheless. One of the witnesses, Little Richard, provides cute comic relief in the middle of the dramatic heat.Much of this film is full of style and glamour. The singing scenes with Frankie are so inspiring and energetic it is hard not to want to clap for him at the end of his performance. Speaking of performances, Larenz Tate acts creatively and hip as Frankie himself. Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and Lela Rochon are all perfect in their roles as well. All of their characters discharge chemistry from one another.Around mid-point in Why Do Fools Fall In Love the hard truth sets in. Frankie Lymon becomes a has-been and discovers the world of crime and drugs. The movie losses its energy, becomes dark and goes down hill. Frankie gets in fights with druggies, his wife, his agents, and in an emotionally disturbing scene he even has the gull to throw his wife's pet dog out the window. This movie beings as a charm feast and turns into a profanely fueled, hard core slice of street life. This concept does not work, and in some ways, ruins the production. I think the filmmakers should have focused a little bit more on Frankie's successes than his failures, then we may have had a lot here.Even so, the last twenty minutes of the film we just great, and we leave the movie with a happy feeling inside knowing forever about the successes and disappointments of Frankie Lymon. Isn't that what this kind of movie exists for, informing us about somebody in an entertaining way. In that case, this is an imaginative gem of truth and lies.

Larenz Tate's portrayal of Frankie Lymon was not good, especially in musical performances. He doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are Larenz Tate, when he should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has Hollywood written all over it. The powers that be obviously pushed it, but it only made the characters more unrealistic. The positives of the movie were Miguel Nunez's portrayal of Little Richard, and the cameo of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. It's too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this film was a wasted opportunity.

Larenz Tate is great as Frankie Lymon although the film isn't really his, it's more the story of his wives. Played three fine black actresses. The music, settings and direction  are all every good. If you wanna have a good time chekc this one out. "},{"Title":"Frankie Lymon Dies Again","Date":"28 August 1999","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  Frankie Lymon died of a drug overdose in 1968.As a big one hit wonder with his song Why Do Fools Fall In Love Lymon might have received some royalties from the record, but didn't. When three former wives hear a version of the song done by Diana Ross,they want to sue for royalties but first each of the three women must win a court case to prove who was the real and legal wife of Frankie Lymon. The movie Why Do Fools Fall In Love is a shoddy and disrespectful look into the life of Frankie Lymon. The movie is truly about these three women trying to win the royalties of the song, not to prove they really loved Frankie Lymon.  It is bad enough that Hollywood makes a movie about a black male celebrity that Hollywood always brings up the details of Lymon's drug use and points to him for the audience that he is a loser after his singing days are over. We never get a true look at Frankie Lymon and his life.Where did the movie fail in one big detail?  Lymon was not as short as the actor who portrayed him ,the talented Larenz Tate,he grew up to over six feet tall.His singing voice changed of course,he couldn't sing those sweet songs of his youth,but he had a decent voice in his adult years. But no one wanted the grown up Frankie Lymon.They wanted this little kid with the falsetto voice,not the adult Frankie Lymon and he couldn't get noticed in the new R&B market that came to pass in the sixties. His story ,and the story of his former group the Teenagers,was done quite well in a PBS documentary about the group called I Promise To Remember.This was shown several years ago and it is worth while to look at about what happen to the group ,where they are now(where they were at the time of the broadcast),and and what happened to Frankie in truth.It is a well done program. The movie is not,however.Filled with profanity,the women come off as bitter uneducated jerks only going for the money.The film and the film makers in essence then to degrade the subject as a three timing drug taking failure.The film lowers itself then as the wives complain about Frankie and start the feminist cant about men in general and Frankie in particular.It doesn't bother the filmakers that Lymon's real life family has to watch him being dragged thru the mud and embarrassed and that they have to have him and themselves disgraced in this fashion. The three women got thankfully very little after  in the end and the viewers of this film receive the same,very little.Frankie Lymon was not perfect,he was no saint.But this film disgraces him ,just like Bird did to Charlie Parker.In the end of the film we see the real Lymon singing Goody-Goody on a TV show.It is the only glimpse of the real Lymon in the movie.But after this film Frankie Lymon shall be looked at in one way and one way only,as a tragic disgrace.

I'm a big Frankie Lymon fan, so it's nice to see a movie about him. The music was great in the film, and I think Tate did a great job as Frankie. And of course the leading ladies were great, hilarious, and emotional. I do have a question though. The credits don't list who plays the Kinks. There was a scene where they performed on Hullaballoo. Does anyone have any idea? Particularly who played Dave Davies? I was told it was remastered from an original show, but I highly doubt it. Overall, this is definitely a movie I added to my collection. I recommend for any doowop fan! "},{"Title":"Better than That Thing You Do","Date":"26 June 2000","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama, Music","Review":"  A movie about a one hit wonder and three wives that claim to be the true widow of Frankie Lymon. Of course everyone has heard the famous song, Why Do Fools Fall In Love from the radio no matter what age you are (I am 21 and first heard it from American Graffiti about 5 years ago.) Before the movie was released, I saw a segment on Entertainment Tonight about the three REAL wives and what they went through in court. The only difference between these women and the women in the movie (all well played by Halle, Vivica and Lela) is that they did not wind up friends. In the movie Larenz Tate portrays Frankie as a liar and a drug addict who told those women stories so that he could have someone to be with, and these women were blown away by him. But the real question is Who was legally married to him at the time of his death? But Frankie was a smooth talker in the movie and he charmed everyone. It is not a great movie, but it is worth watching. 3/5 stars. "}]
