And it's surprisingly underrated.This is by no means a comedy, although it has its funny moments. It is dramatic, more than anything. In fact, this is often a depressing film but joyful at the same time. Unlike its sequels, this one has a clever plot (a sentimental one, I'd say). It's heartwarming, in the line of others like this such as 'Old Yeller', 'Homeward Bound The Incredible Journey', 'Napoleon' and 'Fluke'.Despite the title, the story isn't just about our very dear canine friend Buddy (even if he is the main star). The story also focus on Josh Framm, who is a crucial character, together with the dog. After all, they are destined to be best friends. Josh is Buddy's salvation, but Buddy also plays an important role to save Josh's life. Buddy escapes from his alcoholic and aggressive owner and finds a peaceful life with Josh. On the other hand, Josh gets over depression and shyness thanks to Buddy, which gives the him will to live and brings back Josh's lost interest in basketball.That's when the movie's most original thing happens Buddy can play basketball! That is just amazing! Like everybody else in the movie, to see the dog playing basketball leaves me speechless. That dog has an incredible talent for basketball and even more unbelievable is that he never fails. He's a much better and natural-born player than the humans themselves. He becomes the mascot of Josh's basketball team... which brings them lots of luck.The beauty of this movie isn't just in the dramatic story, but also in the friendship between Josh and man's best friend. Plus, Buddy is a Golden Retriever, my favorite dog breed. Golden Retrievers look so friendly and pacific. They are in fact. They are among the world's sweetest and most beautiful dogs.But the magnificent scenario also gives beauty to the movie rivers, green places, a nice village. All of this is very well combined with soft, relaxing and beautiful piano music (like in Fluke).Tom is an eccentric boy who always carries minor pieces of garbage to give him luck. It is, however, a bit disturbing to see that Joe coach throwing him numerous basketballs, causing the boy to shake nervously and feel very tired.Larry, although constantly picking on Josh, isn't really annoying or stupid. He is more of an arrogant and jealous guy than actually mean. Despite having some deeply touching moments, the most heartbreaking moment of the movie is when Buddy crosses the river and tries to follow the river boat which Josh catches. That scene always makes tears come to my eyes.As for the cast, Kevin Zegers (a sports boy in real life, just like Noah Hathaway) is wonderful in the role of Josh Framm and Buddy the Dog is simply fantastic as Buddy. I was so sad when I found out that Buddy died. He was a friendly, adorable, beautiful and very talented dog. The little girl who plays Josh's cute little sister (whoever she is) is alright either.But I don't like some of the characters at all. Norm Snively is a drunk, abusive man and a loser as a clown. Coach Joe is a jerk and unkind. Larry's father is a jerk and a hypocrite. This should definitely be on Top 250.

It has a dignified place in the list of the greatest animal movies as well. In many ways it is a depressing movie but it's also heart-warming, touching, feel-good and tons of fun. There's more to it to like, though. Cinematography is really beautiful and pure. The soundtrack is just perfect for this film. The boy and his devoted four-legged friend make a marvelous team and have a perfect chemistry.Even though the film's title obviously refers to the dog, his name is actually Buddy - that is, once he ends up in the hands of Josh Framm. Even as the movie starts, the little we see is enough to realize how horribly the clown treats his dog (constantly yelling at him, threatening him and hitting him hard with the newspaper). It is heartbreaking to see that. Fortunately, this horrible man accidentally loses him and he finds Josh Framm (a, I assume, 12-year-old who is loving and caring but very shy and silent and currently under depressive mood). They quickly become best friends, as Josh gives him the treatment he deserves. Buddy is a very special dog alone, but he has a special secret that makes him even more special he can play basketball (even more amazing, better than humans can!).Even though the clown is a horrible person, he doesn't have that much of a role. He is not someone I sympathize with and he certainly isn't funny, although it is hilarious when his truck falls apart and he can't stop it and accidentally drives it into a river.Larry Willingham's father is a jerk. Even though Larry unfairly picks on Josh, at least he isn't too bratty and is funny at times. But Larry's father, that guy is such a jerk, although not overly annoying. Coach Joe isn't especially sympathetic because he is very impatient and temperamental, but he goes too far when he throws basketballs at Josh's peculiar friend Tom with aggressiveness.The movie is focused more on Josh and Buddy, who are the most likable characters of the movie. Kevin Zegers is flawless as Josh Framm. Buddy the Dog is amazing as Buddy (may this wonderful dog rest in peace, wherever he is now). Brendan Fletcher does a good job as Larry. So does Shayn Solberg as Josh's good friend Tom. The late Eric Christmas is hilarious as Judge Cranfield.Title in Portugal 'Air Bud'.

Snively and his dog Buddy worked as a clown act, Clown and a Hound. They arrive to do a child's birthday party. Norm isn't really a very good clown and Buddy ended up upstaging him so the two are thrown out. Norm throws a temper tantrum then says he's taking Buddy to the pound but on the way, Buddy's crate falls off the back of the truck and lands in the street. It's nearly run over by a car containing the Framm family who were new to Fernfield. There was mom, Jackie and her children Josh and Andrea. Josh had lost his father a year ago and it looked as though his new life in a new town would be dull. At school, they tried enrolling him in an extra-carricular activity, like band, but that didn't work out very well. On his way home, he found a basketball court in the back of an old, abandoned church so he began shooting hoops. That's when he met Buddy who didn't come very close to him. Josh decides to try out for the basketball team at school and surly Coach Barker makes him a waterboy. When Josh is sent downstairs to wash a load of jerseys, he learns that the school custodeon was in fact Arthur Chaney of the 1956 New York Knicks!          When shooting hoops in the court the next day, Josh saw Buddy again and to Josh's surprise, Buddy could play ball so they played around the court for a while then Josh brought him home and tried to give him a bath and hide him from Jackie, but she soon found out and said keeping him was out of the question, but Josh got Buddy an old refrigerator box to sleep in in the backyard. Jackie agreed to let Buddy stay until Christmas which was two weeks away. So soon Christmas morning arrives and Josh runs downstairs to find Buddy under the tree with a big bow on his head. Josh was ecstatic! At school, Josh tried out for the team and to his surprise, he made it! In the mornings when Jackie went out to get the newspaper, it wasn't there. That's because Buddy would snatch it and bury it. Soon Josh learns that not only can Buddy pass the basketball around but he can shoot hoops! Buddy becomes a team mascot. It was that afternoon that Coach Barker was seen throwing basketballs at a teammate and the principal frowned on that so Barker was fired. Josh suggested the replacement coach be Arthur Chaney, who jumped at the chance. He taught the children about teamwork and sportsmanship.         Buddy got to play in an actual game. Things were really looking up! Buddy made news stories all over town, which unfortunately Norm got wind of so he stopped by the Framm house and reclaimed Buddy. Josh was devastated but he made a plan to go get Buddy and make it to the big game. Josh sneaked into Norm's backyard, unchained Buddy and the two escape. Norm sees, jumps in his faulty old pick-up truck and gives chase. They run all the way to the shore. That's when the brakes give out and Norm drives right into the river. That evening, Josh and Buddy play in the big game and WIN!! That's when Norm showed up and decided to take this to court. After much deliberation, the judge decided, well actually Chaney convinced him to let Buddy decide who his master should be. The judge allowed it. Buddy bit Norm then chose Josh so they all lived happily ever after.        This movie is pretty good. It has it's funny moments. I'm sorry to say that Buddy the dog is no longer with us. He died after the film's release. From surgical complications or something. Other members of the cast include Michael Jeter as Norm. Why does he always get calls to play weirdos and crazies??! Bill Cobb is here too! Air Bud is followed by a seemingly endless line of sequels! Air Bud II Golden Receiver in 1998 in which Buddy plays football, Air Bud III World Pup in 1999 where he plays soccer, Air Bud IV Seven Inning Fetch in 2002 where he plays baseball and coming soon Air Bud V Air Bud Spikes Back.

Buddy's ball skills soon cheer Josh up and ingratiate him with his peers, and they both make the Timberwolves school team.

Josh is the 'waterboy' of the school's basketball-team, but that changes when he discovers that the dog, with the name Buddy, can play basketball. There's nothing wrong with this film. It's a warm movie about a special friendship between two 'loners'. The story is not always really logical; it's never explained how the dog did find Josh back, but that isn't important. It's a kids movie, and children don't think about the logicalness of the movie. The actors are all wonderful in this film. Wendy Makkena, the shy Maria Roberta in the Sister Act-films, the young Kevin Zegers, a sympathetic Bill Cobs in a cliché role, and most of all Michael Jeter. It's really a shame that he died, it was such a wonderful actor. And of course Buddy, with his wonderful trainer Kevin DiMaccio, also one of the writers and producers.

This film is about a boy who is new to town. One day while playing basketball Josh finds Bud, a abandoned dog. Bud gives Josh faith in himself which leads him to try out for the basketball team. Josh learns that Bud can play basketball too. Josh and Bud just have to be aware of Bud's old abusive owner, Norm Snively the clown. My favorite character is Bud. I like Bud because of his unbiased love of Josh and because Josh and his family took Bud in when his old abusive owner was about to take him to the pound. However, I like him mostly because he is talented and it is pretty cool that he can play basketball. My favorite scenes are when Bud decides to bite his old owner Norm the clown and runs back to his new family, Josh and the rest of the Framms. My other favorite scene is when Bud actually plays for Josh's team because one player is injured and another fouls out of the game. What I like about this movie is how well the stunt coordinator trained Bud, so in the movie he has such great aptitude or talent. The cinematography is well done and how it is anthropomorphic in how Bud is able to play basketball, like he is just another kid on the team. I think that people who love animals, sports and comedy mixed with a little heart warming scenes will absolutely love this incredible film. I know this because I really love this film and I hope you will as well. Also even if you don't really like sports or animal movies you will still enjoy this film as it has a great story to follow. This movie is great for the whole family. There is a strong moral to the story as well as many emotionally gripping scenes for everyone to enjoy. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars because it is a great movie that everyone can sit down and enjoy.

That simple-minded gesture is followed by the cage nearly hit by a car and the passengers not checking. Then a boy meets the dog with its ability to bunt basketballs. The dog will eventually and predictably become school mascot. Directed by Charles Martin Smith who does his best but the characters do illogical things such as not having the dog checked. Sure, the dog is friendly but so was Cujo at one point. Then comes the embarrassing court case to decide the dog's owner. That is when the dog should have fled the set. Kevin Zegers is given little challenge reciting what countless other kids have played. Michael Jeter's clown is an idiot, plain and simple. Wendy Makkena plays Zegers' less than swift mother. Bill Cobb plays former basketball player turn toilet attendant who delivers his two cents worth after we have long drifted off to sleep. Eric Christmas plays a judge who obviously should quit his practice after listening to a dog. Perhaps he can do us all a favor and flush this tiny tot film down the toilet.

It has a very good plot to it, although it may be a bit absurd.  The family featured in the movie is a very real type of family, maybe a little more perfect than your everyday family, but real enough to be in a movie.  The films that have followed this one have been okay, but they have just kept getting weirder and odder.  I mean, a dog playing football?  Then soccer, and then baseball?!  The second and third were reasonable, but the baseball one just doesn't make sense.  The main reason I even had a care for liking this movie is because it has a dog in it.  Movies that feature animals are usually ones that are more heartwarming and ones that took more effort to make than just telling somewhat what to do, where in this case they actually had to train a dog. The other thing that I really liked about this movie was the music.  The music was composed by Brahm Wenger who did the music for the MVP chimpanzee movies as well.  The music has a lot of string instruments in it which give the movie an at-home feeling.  Since there is no suspense in this movie there is no need for suspenseful music, but if there was a need, the music would probably be really good, coordinating to the main music of course.  The setting added to the outstanding music made this movie one that I like to watch.  Just the three key elements that I have listed kept me watching and liking this film.  The three elements are involving a dog in the movie, the amazing music, and the realistic setting.  The reason the setting is a key element to why I liked the movie is because it was a very beautiful setting, with lots of greenery and trees.  The setting also seemed a lot more real than a lot of other movies I have seen.  The setting in those other movies is one that is perfect, like I said about how the family in the movie wasn't.  So the setting adds to a lot of the ambition of this movie.Kevin Zeggers, who plays Josh Framm in the movie, continues to grow up in the concluding movies.  He starts out as a kid and arrives a teen at what will seem to be like the end of the movies, if not, and adult.  There are some real issues that this movie elucidates, giving it a ratiocination at the least, to be a favorable movie.  There is a little bit of comedy in this movie, especially concerning the evil clown.  There is also a little bit of sadness accompanying the laughs.  I cannot think of any reason off the top of my head that would make this movie better than it already is.  With all of the reasons I have given, I entrust this movie a 9 out of 10, for lacking nothing of main concern.

I was in my early teens at the time, and it definitely didn't turn out to be one of my all-time favourite movies, but I think I was impressed with a lot of it. I certainly wasn't bored. If I remember correctly, what I liked the most about Air Bud was the dog, since I found him so cute. I think he often put a smile on my face, at least early in the film. However, if I hadn't seen the film years ago, I doubt I would have ever bothered watching it, but since I remembered it, I decided to watch it again eight years later. This time, I knew it wasn't a very popular movie, and unsurprisingly, I noticed some flaws I hadn't noticed before. Josh Framm is a boy who has just moved to Fernfield, Washington with his mother and younger sister after the tragic death of his father. At school in this town, he has no friends, and despite his interest in basketball, he is too shy to try out for the school's team. He discovers an abandoned basketball court in the town, and starts shooting hoops there. He also meets a stray golden retriever in that area, one who was lost by his abusive owner, a clown named Norm Snively, when he fell out of his truck. Josh quickly befriends this dog, naming him Buddy, and sees that he's also good at basketball! Eventually, Josh does make the school team, and Buddy soon joins in, which brings him a lot of attention. Unfortunately, however, after Norm Snively sees his lost dog on TV, he wants him back. The relationship between the boy and the dog could be in trouble, and so could the team! This movie is hands down a failure when it comes to humour. This includes the beginning, with Norm Snively, played by Michael Jeter, at a birthday party with Buddy (before he loses him), trying to entertain a bunch of kids, which leads to some weak slapstick, making a huge mess in the house. The scene where Josh's mother sees Buddy for the first time is a lot like that, with more unfunny slapstick leading to a huge mess. Norm is supposed to be a really funny character, but VERY rarely is. As for the serious parts, they're not terrible, but aren't really that gripping or anything. A bit of emotion or tension wasn't enough to make it satisfying. Basically, Air Bud is another mediocre modern-day PG-rated kiddie flick, but I guess it's harmless, and many kids could enjoy it. As for me, I'm going to have to move on, and not bother watching this movie's one theatrical sequel or any of its many direct-to-video sequels.

His passion is basketball, but hes kind of shy and weird around kids and doesn't try out for the team at first. He finds a stray dog and soon learns the dog can actually shoot hoops with his nose. After a while he joins the team and soon the whole town witnesses the dogs talents and he ends up on the team. Soon, once the original owner of the dog who hated him finds out the dog is famous he comes back to claim him for his own.I had watched this movie a few times years ago and it was just another predictable happy ending kids film. I must admit there's hundreds of thousands of these movies made and they are all pretty much the same. Good for a kid to set down and kept shut up for an hour and a half. You know how they are gonna end and what the story is all about just by looking at the cover art.I didn't hate it, but it offered nothing great. I like Kevin Zegers and I had watched this a few times 12 or 13 years ago when it came out and thought it was okay for a kids movie. Eric Christmas does good as the judge and Michael Jeter plays a good bad guy here..I always give credit to directors who work with animals, it cannot be an easy job. The director of this film made an old horror movie from 86 I love called Trick or Treat so thats a cool plus for me.Watch it and decide for yourself but you aren't seeing anything new here. Maybe a dog playing basketball isn't that heard of or seen, but it's not too impressive and the story itself is middle of the road 3/10 stars.

Mighty Ducks 1 2 and 3, Little Big League, Rookie of the Year, Little Giants, etc., etc...., so why are they still being made?  The plots are always predictable and these films are always directed at kids.  The Waterboy is similar, but they injected enough adult humor into it to make it work out greatly.  Now this film had a sequel come out less than a year after the first hit theaters, and a third one to come out in 1999.  Why?  I, personally, have seen enough movies with this overdone plotline.  Just once I'd like to see a movie where a winning team signs on someone they think is great, but they really stink, and they have to stay on the team and keep playing because of a contract, and eventually the team ends up in last place.  Maybe this will be the basis of the third film, the dog gets worms or something.  Then I'll see it.

I question how many dogs died in the making of this movie, seeing as a breaking of the nose during some crazy dawg action trying to score with the basketball. Also, I've heard that pudding isn't good for dogs...ya. And also, this is basically dissing American basketball. A team of kids who haven't won a single game...And along comes a dog, which appears to be a better teacher than any of the boys, as well as better than the whole team. (Even though it has no idea what it's doing.) Oh ya! I just remembered. Golden retrievers don't have thumbs. So, the writer's brilliant plan? Airbud hits the the basketball with his nose basically the whole movie! One problem. I've tried that before. Make that two problems. It breaks the dog's nose, as well as YOU CANT AIM! This is crushing all of the kid's egos! They must be thinking Hey, a dog, with no thumbs, using only his nose is better than me. You'd think some kid would want revenge for all of the humiliation. Although I had tons of fun making fun (fun squared!) of this movie with my good pals, unless you are into all types of cheese possible, watch grass grow. It is more exciting, and has a better plot.
