This really is a great film, which shows how a machine who strangely is endowed with creativity, thought and awareness unlike other robots, strives to become more than he is. This is a great film and very much about family life, emotions, what it means to be human, and trying to better oneself through both serving others and learning with others about oneself. If you ever wanted to be more than you are then watch this film. This is not so much a film about robots or sci-fi, but a film about life and humanity and relationships, love and family. The robots and sci-fi are just a scenario which allows us to explore ourselves more as humans and wonder about our existence.

The caveat for those seeking out a fun film for the entire family is that this movie, though initially sold as a warm cuddly comedy in the tradition of say `Mrs. Doubtfire,' actually deals with some very heavy and heady issues like sexuality, aging and dying, which may make it less-than-ideal viewing for young children.The first section of the film is, by far, its weakest.  In 2005, the wealthy Martin family receives delivery of a brand new servant android (Robin Williams) who, almost immediately, begins to display a remarkable range of human emotions and interests.  Thus, we are set up for yet another in a long line of predictable tales (i.e. `Harry and the Hendersons,' `Stuart Little') in which a family comes to adopt a strange, not-quite-human creature, welcoming him in as one of their own.  Indeed, in the film's early stages, there is no shortage of either bland humor or drippy sentimentality as Andrew, the android, ingratiates himself with all but one of the Martin household.  The `wit' in the film consists, basically, of endless jokes about how Andrew takes all idioms at literal face value, a running gag that is, finally, as unoriginal as it is wearying.Then, however, just as we are about to give up hope in it, the movie becomes more intriguing.  Rather than staying within the context of the present life of this one family, the screenplay begins to move ahead in time, exploring Andrew's gradual growth toward total humanity, while the initial family grows up and eventually dies off.  Actually, despite how one may feel about the film itself, one must admire its boldness and audacity, for it is not often that, in a film billed as a mass audience comedy, all the main characters pass on to their heavenly reward at one point or another &#150; but, then again, how many comedies span a two hundred year time period?  `Bicentennial Man' obviously has more on its mind than mere fish-out-of-water buffoonery, as it becomes an often-elegiac reflection on the transience of life, the meaning of being human and the search for societal acceptance.  The mood of the film is remarkably hushed and reflective at times, which again might make it slow going for the modern mass audience more conditioned to a faster pace and giddier tone, especially in a Robin Williams film (though, of late, his films have certainly been taking on a much more somber quality, vide `What Dreams may Come,' `Patch Adams' and `Jakob the Liar').  There are times when `Bicentennial Man' seems overly impressed with its own self-importance, yet one appreciates its refusal to settle for the easy path of cheap comedy and upbeat sentiments.  There is, indeed, a real sadness to much of the film.Special acknowledgement should be made of the superb art direction, set design, costume design, makeup and special effects that together give the film its understated and believable futuristic look.  In addition, James Horner's melancholic symphonic score, though a bit lubricious at times, does create an atmosphere of contemplative seriousness that perfectly matches the tone and purpose of the film.`Bicentennial Man' may not turn out to be what you are looking for when you first seek it out, but, if you approach it with an open mind and a certain degree of tolerance and indulgence, you may be pleasantly surprised and, perhaps, even rewarded.

This movie quite simply follows the life of a man trapped in a robots body and his quest to be accepted in the world, and be allowed to love and cherish the people close to him.I have to say that i didn't expect much from this movie, i thought it would be a kids film, full of typical Robin Williams style laughs, i was way off in my assumption. This is probably Robin Williams's best performance and it is a very emotional journey through change and development of the human condition.Overall the film is quite amusing, very touching and is full of realistic characters all very well cast to not overshadow 'Andrew' as he quests over 200 years for acceptance.A great movie 9/10 "},{"Title":"Outstanding","Date":"13 August 2006","Score":"106 out of 118 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" I heaven't read the book, but BICENTENNIAL MAN is a very touching and heartwarming movie about a house-robot (Robert Williams) that begins a 200-year journey to become and to be legally recognized as a human.

It's Andrew with his Box of Chocolats, simply going through life searching for what eludes him and what we generally take for granted - humanity. The characters along the way are well acted - in particular the robot creator and his ditsy assistant. This movie is a tear jerker as Andrew's friends come and go and lifetimes pass him by without him really comprehending it all. The only real failings were the large gaps in time and how Andrew came about - but then it's difficult to compress 200 years into 1 1/2 hours.

Forget the reviews of the critics who seem to love bashing films, this is a tremendous, epic film with such a great heart that explores the values and meaning of humanity and life in general. I saw it for the first time in ages today and its still as touching as the first time I saw it a few years ago. In fact I remember it being shown on a plane I was on the year it came out and I watched the first 5 minutes on a screen with poor picture and sound and remember thinking it was just cheesy family comedy which just plays for humor and nothing else. When I first saw it a few years later when there was nothing else on I was completely blown away by it. It was the complete opposite of what I was thought it was originally. This film does have its humor and that humor is often hilarious in parts, but thats because its delivered so brilliantly by Williams who plays his character to perfection. More importantly it is not supposed to be a comedy. Its a drama and features brilliant performances from an underrated cast including Williams, Sam Neill, Embeth Davditz and Oliver Platt among others.The film is also outstanding from a technical perspective. The futuristic cities, buildings and vehicles look fabulous along with the new household appliances, but the most important thing that really steals the show is the Script and Direction from Kazan and Columbus respectively. I will certainly be watching more of Kazan's films in the future and already thought he did a great job on Matilda beforehand. I've always been an admirer of Columbus and this has to be his best film to date. His vision of the film is splendid and I applaud him for bringing such a brilliant set of actors and sets together to make such an epic and unforgettable film.For most of my reviews for films, I don't like commenting too much on the plot, but here I feel the need to because it touched me so much and the plot helps explain why this happened. It is about a Robot that over 200 years, learns about humanity and seeks to be a part of it. At the beginning its more of a comedy as the robot (who's called Andrew) gets used to the way humans are and learns about simple well known things in life i.e Laughter, Sex, Family Life and Change. But further on as he becomes close to the youngest in the family, he learns more about love and how life is. I sympathised with him as he has to witness this and we follow him as he experiences the deaths of the people closest to him. I felt for him due to him being unable to experience these things like we do. Throughout the film I felt (although the critics certainly didn't and many here probably don't) all these things and became closer and closer to him as he constantly never gives up hope on becoming a human. I found it very emotional and I actually appreciated many of my abilities that I as a human have. To love, to cry, to experience changes, to reproduce, watch my children to grow up, to get older and to eventually move onto another life. As Andrew learns about all these things and begins to want them I really did feel for him like I say because I would find it incredibly hard to live if I was like that.SPOILER Having witnessed the ups and downs of Andrew's life throughout the film and his epic journey to finally become a human being, by the end of the film Andrew has managed to fully achieve this. He is fully human and unfortunately misses this declaration by a few seconds. But he didn't need to like his lover Porscha (His closest family member's granddaughter) says. He has done it. He has found the love he's wanted all those many years with her and he won't have to experience the sadness of watching things change ever again. He has moved onto another life like we're all destined to do and Porscha decides to join him. END OF SPOILERBasically, after seeing this film I did learn just how lucky I am to possess all these extraordinary and unique abilities and I don't believe it is just an accident or coincidence. We each have a destiny and I believe God wants us all to experience these things in life and I'm grateful to be here today and will certainly not be taking any of them for granted.I really think that that this film with a rating of just 6.1 and with the harsh and very unfair criticism its got from critics has to be the most underrated misunderstood film ever made. The film is not really in my opinion a family comedy although it unfortunately has been marketed that way. Its a drama about humanity with bits of comedy that should be watched by anyone of any age. I believe it can help people to become, like me, much more grateful for things we as humans perhaps take for granted in life.I thank you for reading this review and advise you to watch this film and prepare to be moved in a way I don't think any film has done or ever could do.10/10 Not my favourite film of all time but certainly in my Top 5. Stunning.

Running Time 133 minutes.   Rated PG (for mild language and some sex-related material) By Blake French	Chris Columbus is very good at directing tearjerkers. He has a history of constructing such movies as Stepmom and Mrs. Doubtfire. Bicentennial Man is being misadvertised as a humble family comedy. Although it starts out unsatisfying, the film gradually becomes more and more penetrating as we discover the film is really about inner emotions,  the changing of times, how people change over time, and the meaning of life from an original point of view. Bicentennial Man is a sweet, touching production with lots of heart and a shapely message.	At first Bicentennial Man looks  to be about a futuristic family who buys an android robot that is supposed to do housework and serve them. The family of four includes two children, one named Little Miss, and the parents who are called by the name of Sir and Ma'am. They adopt Andrew expecting him to be similar to all the other androids in the area. Nearly every household has one. However, Sir soon notices certain features about Andrew that make him unique, different from any other android he has ever seen. Andrew occupies creativity and emotional personality, elements that these robots are presumed not to contain.	The film doesn't contain a good an introduction to the family who adopts Andrew, which is mainly the reason why I was never entirely concerned for the characters. But the reasoning behind the lack of focus on the family is due to the fact that Bicentennial Man isn't about the family who buys Andrew, but a narrative of Andrew himself.	A running flaw in the film is our foundering curiosity that only grows more ponderous as the script progresses. The audience desires more information about why Andrew is so different from the other robots. There are obvious reasons, sure, but what I wanted was an explanation of why he is special. A lust for information that is never appropriately granted.The film skips ahead a generation or so. Sir and Ma'am age and Little Miss grows to be a full grown woman. Many things change for Andrew. He begins to wonder what lies beyond the likes of his household. He longs for emotional reactions to take place on his face and the concept of freedom. Sir has taught Andrew about death, sex, love, humor, and time. He gradually wants more and more independence. This is where Andrew starts becoming interested in turning from a mechanical being to a biological being.	The age advancing make-up is believable and awe-inducing. I could hardly trust my eyes that Sam Neill wasn't an old man in the movie. However, although I can see that the filmmakers had no other reliable option, I disliked the jumps in time the it takes. The time gaps force us out of massive plot pieces, some of which are important to the character development.	There are some really funny moments in Bicentennial Man. Most of them appear when the picture becomes a bit emotionally heavy, in order to relieve such tension in the audience. This is a wise choice in the writer's part; the viewers who do mistake this movie as a family comedy will gain some satisfaction from these insulated humorous moments.   	I wanted more information on how the robot Andrew gradually becomes ''human.'' I felt cheated out of a lot of decent, noteworthy material here. I felt this way because the scenes where we do have the privilege to see Andrew reinvented are wonderfully inventive and interesting. The film should have leaned towards that material a little more. 	The movie features super charged performances by the entire cast. Robin Williams offers an emotionally accurate acting job that brings the confusion and imagination of the android Andrew to life. The supporting cast is also filled with fine performances with Sam Neill, Wendy Crewson, Embeth Davidtz, and Oliver Platt.	Even though I can admit that Bicentennial Man contains several flawed motives, I still was a little surprised that the film opened to many negative reviews. This isn't a bad movie, just a differently anticipated one. The movie sets up its effective conclusion from the very beginning; it is the only logical climax for such a story. Although it leaves viewers with a sense of well-being, I thought it posed too many spiritual and biological questions. Overall, however, the movie is a well-depicted idea that deserves more appreciation from audiences than its receiving.  Brought to you by Touchstone Pictures and Columbia Pictures.

This Chris Columbus directed movie, with the ever-eloquent Robin Williams, and radiant double deliveries (two character portrayals) by Embeth Davidtz, is not the usual Robin Williams comedy fare. It's not Flubber or Mrs. Doubtfire; it's a philosophical fable at best. It's the reverse of John Boorman's Zardoz (1973), where man wanting to be eternally youthful -- here, Robot Andrew (Robin Williams) does not want to be immortal. He wants to experience and feel life, and with a beloved human companion.  This Robotic journey spanning decades, gives us life lessons, prompts us to think reflectively on questions of life and living, growing old and resignation to death. The point filtered through Portia (Embeth Davidtz) that being human is to risk and make mistakes/wrong decisions, hearkens to a quote by John Cage Computers are always right, but life isn't about being right. Film score is by James Horner (Legends of the Fall, Braveheart, Titanic). Location shots include San Francisco landmarks with added air transport images (likened to The Fifth Element) in a futuristic sky. There are no explosive actions or flying bullets, it's an immortal tale about the acceptance of being a mortal human.

The first was the temporary backlash against Robin Williams at the time for his performance in the manipulative Patch Adams. The second was the onslaught of reviews that called it schmaltzy and overly-sentimental. Well, I never found it to be that way. If you want to watch a horribly manipulative and sentimental emotional rape then check-out the other Columbus/Williams movie Mrs. Doubtfire. I'd rather throw myself into the path of an oncoming combine harvester than watch that again.The film opens in 2005 (the near future at the time) as Mr. Martin (Sam Neill), a wealthy businessman has a robot servant delivered to his luxurious home. As soon as the robot is powered up he seems to be...different. His name is Andrew (which means man or manly) and while his body may be robotic, his personality is not. In fact he very slowly develops and learns human characteristics as he interacts and responds to the world around him.Mr. Martin is astonished by Andrew's ability to understand art and music. He treats him like a member of the family and educates him by the fire every night on the customs and history of mankind. As the years pass and lives fade away Andrew sets-off on a decades-long journey to find other robots like him. The quest ends when he meets Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), a robotics engineer who turns Andrew from a simple robot into a life-like android. Upon returning home with his new appearance he falls in love with his old master's great-granddaughter, who is an exact double of her grandmother. They want to be with each other so badly but know they will never be accepted by society unless Andrew can become fully human. Which is impossible.Or is it? It's a question for the atheists and religious zealots to fight over. At what point does Andrew develop a soul? Why is he different from other robots? Did God give him the gift of human emotion? It is a cosmic selection or is it up to the World Council to declare Andrew human? It all builds to a heartbreaking ending, that is honestly one of the toughest movie endings I have ever had to sit through. I can't even write about it so I'll end my description here.This is familiar territory for Williams though. His performance as Mork learning about Earth and marrying a human woman is rather close to Andrew Martin's journey to become a man. And although I wouldn't call it a kid's film, or even a comedy, there are still a lot of laughs. But not in the usual anarchic Williams style. Andrew's curiosity of the world is a much more refined and quieter performance. It's a shame that most people can't see that it's Williams inside the suit for the first hour of the film as it makes us forget he's there on the screen and perhaps appreciate his acting ability less.James Horner's score is also simply wonderful. It's hard to believe the man who gave us the storming action sound of Commando and Aliens could also be capable of something so warm and beautiful. I guess they didn't give him the award for Titanic for nothing. For this movie he again teamed-up with Celine Dion to record the song Then You Look At Me, which is the perfect tune to roll the credits to. I don't care what you think about me, I love it. Even if the lyrics make that ending even more harrowing.Despite going as far ahead as the year 2205, there's no utopia or dystopia subtext to distract us from the story of Andrew's life. The evolution of technology and architecture is handled subtly and is unobtrusive. It's a quirky irony though, that Andrew's inventions and discoveries help save lives and forward the human race despite not being fully human himself.Bicentennial Man is certainly the most mature and subversive film of Chris Columbus' career as a director. As I said, not a kid's film but a masterpiece of science-fiction and character drama. How anyone could ever truly hate this film is beyond me.

Tread carefully.Like most other reviewers, I could not help but notice how perfect the future was, yet how much it resembled the 20th century. However, all that, IMO, is irrelevant to the plot.Now, I haven't read Asimov's book (as a matter of fact, I had no idea this movie was based on a book till I logged on to IMDb), but even if I had, I wouldn't go in with the highest expectations, knowing how Hollywood mucks things up.My parents, who have already watched this film, praised it quite highly, but my sister trashed it as boring. I went in with mediocre expectations, particularly because I don't have much affinity for movies dealing with artificial intelligence.I was pleasantly surprised by the plot. Perhaps it's just me, but I really felt I could actually relate to the robot. I didn't care that it was Robin Williams. I didn't care the future was totally unrealistic. In a sense, I think I related to Andrew because of my personality; I'm awkward in social situations, and am always utterly agreeable.I probably fell for the plot like a sucker, but I liked falling for it. Whatever superficial goofs the movie made were more than made up for me by the story, which I found brilliantly beautiful. I really cannot think of adjectives that would sufficiently describe it, but.... it's just something that really appealed to me.Besides the similarities I found between myself and Andrew, I think I was also touched by many elements of the plot; independence, freedom, recognition, a spurned love... And the philosophical issues, most imperatively. I've always enjoyed pondering the moral issues surrounding robots, immortality, and so on. I think that's probably what drew me in. Watching the people Andrew loved die was probably the part of the film that touched me most, because I'm a very nostalgic person at heart - I love recalling past incidents, people I knew... and I felt Andrew's pain at losing the people he loved most.A lot of reviewers criticised this movie for its unrealistic portrayal of the future, its failure to properly adapt Asimov's book (from what I've heard about it, it does sound like a great pity, as the book seems more powerful), hell, even the music played.But none of that stuff really matters to me. The story was quite philosophical, with all the touches of sentimentality that make me melt like butter in a frying pan. This movie is probably one of the most touching and brilliant dramas I've watched, outdoing A Beautiful Mind, my previous most favourite drama.

Although it is unavoidable, we regard it as very sad. The fact that this movie does tap into that deep fear and sadness in all of us is a testament to just how on target it is.And give credit to Asimov.

Amanda refers to the android as 'Andrew', and that becomes his name. The android seems very much like a human, with feelings and emotions, but is very proper and polite and does whatever it is asked, which leads to some humorous moments when Grace wants to kill it. Andrew eventually becomes not only a valued servant but a beloved friend and an artist.Amanda becomes an adult all too quickly (I liked Hallie Kate Eisenberg's performance, but Embeth Davidtz was so good I didn't really care that much after a while). She thinks of Andrew as more than just a friend, but she wants to marry another man because, after all, Andrew is not really human.The movie keeps advancing forward, usually by several decades at a time. Without revealing too much, I will say that we see 200 years in the 'life' of Andrew, which gives us the film's title. Andrew does keep in contact with the family he grew up with, but he longs for relationships with other human-type robots. His quest leads him to Rupert Burns, who restores old robots and has the ability to make Andrew more 'human'.I thought Robin Williams did a wonderful job. Even when he was only the voice, he was so charming and so proper, often making Andrew funny when Andrew didn't realize he was being funny, but also humorous when Andrew wanted to be that way. Later, Rupert's 'improvements' meant we saw Williams as well as hearing him. The original robot seemed to have a personality, though, with facial expressions showing emotions and feelings, even though a robot was not supposed to have those.Oliver Platt gave the other standout performance as Rupert. One human-type robot that worked for Rupert was Galatea, who I found very annoying.Since the characters had to age many years, making the characters look elderly was critical, and the makeup artists did a very convincing job. I was quite pleased with the music. Only at the end (in the 23rd century) did I realize the movie was staring sometime after the year 2000, but futuristic music was not used. Most of the music used for dancing and special occasions was classical, and one scene had great performances of big-band standards which must have been over 100 years old.It was obvious certain locations were from the distant future, since many buildings appeared to be straight out of 'The Jetsons', and flying cars had taken over most transportation. It was nice to see certain classic architecture, including a magnificent church where Amanda got married, which her granddaughter had a role in restoring many years later. Also still around over a hundred years in the future our beautiful U. S. Capitol dome. I was disappointed that more effort did not go into making this a family movie, which it could have been. For the first thirty minutes or so, this film could have gotten a TV-G rating the way it aired on ABC-TV. One curse word was the only thing to be concerned about (and this one won't affect a G rating these days). There was a tasteful but humorous discussion after Andrew heard 'the facts of life' from Richard (the actual description of what takes place did not appear in the movie). Then there were jokes, some off-color, after Andrew learned about humor. None of this would have made this movie off-limits to most kids during the first 45 minutes, though certain PG curse words showed up from time to time after that. Yet for some odd reason a TV-14 rating was used, which I do not understand. The movie contained some sexual content but nothing nearly as bad as, say, an NBC sitcom. This was a movie worth seeing. Possible SPOILER here I said Galatea was annoying, but that was before I realized she was the cute quirky chick from 'Life Goes On' and 'Saved by the Bell The College Years'. I recognized her immediately at movie's end when she looked human like Andrew. If I had known, I might have liked her better.

It was impossible not to cry when Sir was about to die and called Andrew to speak the famous last words. I saw in this film a big message about prejudice, racism and problems involving intolerance, and we are able to feel and be in the place the underdog is.But I felt the movie could have explored even more the friendship between them and could have ended after Sir and Ma'am deaths.

SPOILERS!","Date":"21 August 2002","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" I remember Asimov's story far more emotionally; but then, I was a mere teenager when I first read Bicentennial Man. The short story has no expressed romance between Little Miss and Andrew Martin, as there is in the movie, and I'm sure it was better that way, because that just heightened the pathos surely the very core of this story. Instead the film is forced to invent a lookalike granddaughter Portia in order to compensate for the robot's long lifespan. Cheesy. I was disappointed in this, I have to admit. The reactions of the wife/mother Ma'am(Wendy Crewson, a wonderful actress under normal circumstances) are especially irritating, and frankly, not believable. Women, of all people, would accept robots far more readily and respond to them emotionally. For exactly the same reason that Little Miss liked Andrew almost instantly, any mother could and would muster--at least--warmth for him, ESPECIALLY if he was as gentle with the children as Andrew clearly was. Remember Sarah Connor, who decided that she would let The Terminator raise her one and only child because he would make the best father of all the candidates? Well, if she could think like that (despite being highly suspicious), then why couldn't Ma'Am? It's crazy, and not believable. The always-under-foot syndrome, too, could've been handled with more subtlety or just minimalist comedy, to show intelligent adjustment. Did the mother want to perform household chores herself or not? I completely fail to understand the woman's emotional/intellectual wherewithal (ineptitude). Basically, we're forced to conclude that except for Sir and Little Miss, the rest of the family were lost causes. This despite that robots were supposed to be commonplace. This abysmal character development has to be inherent to the Nicholas Kazan screenplay, we can't blame the unfortunate Wendy Crewson. The very same thing is wrong with AI(2001). The mother, again(?!), is even more insipid and daft. Such characters do test one's patience, because they are such an obvious fraud, for the sake of some plot-development or other it is CLUMSY WRITING.The Martins actually had a helpful, and an astonishingly verbally adroit android (compared to current technology), amazingly well-socialized into the family. He was safe (for them), and in his own way funny, courteous, smart, talented, and permanently so! I'd trade him in for any of my last three boyfriends. Why wouldn't any of these people come to terms with Andrew? Ridiculous.Perhaps the problem was that Chris Columbus et al waited too long to make the movie. Other sci-fis like Terminator(1984), in fact, had already surpassed Asimov's notions about humanity's political incapacity and rejection of androids/robots. We've also (suffered through) I-don't-know-how-many court cases about android rights on Star Trek, and the Voyager Doctor's frankly irritating harping about hologram rights ad nauseam, so that declaring a robot as in fact human is no longer such a biggie. That had been the guts of the original 1976 story, but audiences are now far too sophisticated - watched 14yrs of Star Trek! (Viewers interested in more Asimov robot stories should read I, Robot and The Rest of the Robots. They are excellent short stories.) What I think happened was that certain contractual obligations about movie-making, and particularly this script, may have gotten in the way of creative output (eg the option was about to run out, and since the CGI technology was OK, it was now or never). We may have ended up with an out-evolved turkey because of the business being not show-art. I don't know that this is what happened, but it sounds plausible to me. The Three (really Four, Asimov added another one) Laws of Robotics is a very good place to start robot ethics; they are not in debate. The hard part about making Andrew real would be socializing him to the degree he was in the movie. That's what we still can't do. We can't teach context. That's the stumbling block. Neural nets do their learning usually with human cheating (called back-propagation - don't ask, I always thought the technique completely disreputable, so I cringed and winced may way through 7 years of Data's pride in his own neural net on ST-NG). But context requires generalization into abstracts from the concrete, and then reversing back again, and the mapping onto the real world has to be accurate >95% of the time. So it's a whole new kettle of fish. Roger Schank modularized layers of contexts as individual nested subroutines, and called them schemas, which a computer could simulate. But you just couldn't schematize/digitize enough of reality, it takes too much room. The human brain excels at filling in blanks (based on this bi-directional mapping of the essential & the generalized). Computers and robots suck at this. They have no real life experience to guess with. They need a background library the size of a planet to carry around just to take a walk in the park. Which is why Andrew Martin is so impressive. So. Wherefore art thou, Bicentennial Man? Perhaps Rodney Brooks (bottom-up architecture with Cog, Kismet) needs to team up with Doug Lenat (CYClist, top-down architecture, hand-codes reality one step at a time) so they can hit paydirt somewhere in the middle. That they should join forces is EXTREMELY unlikely they are both using diametrically opposed concepts and code. The other possibility is that Honda will beat them to it, with their human-shaped white robot that walks up stairs. Otherwise, Bicentennial Man may be another couple of centuries away. Growing up is aardvark (hard work).

Perhaps that is why the reviewers and many viewers did not understand or enjoy it. In fact, the laws are mentioned only at the beginning. Nevertheless, they are essential to this story and the story's imaginary robotics industry. The laws are burned into every robot in hopes of eliminating humans' innate fear of being replaced by superior (mental or physical) technology. If they don't allay peoples' fears, there would be no robotics industry.When the robot, Andrew, obeys the order to jump out of the second story window, this was a pivotal point.  The fall causes internal as well as external damage which subverts the three laws in him. This was better exhibited later when he disobeys a direct order to come closer to a window on the 37th floor. The subversion of the three laws gives Andrew free will, self-expression and the desire to be just like his owner. Sir, Andrew's owner, sees the self-expression and decides to develop it. A robotics executive recognizes that the three laws are no longer fully functional in Andrew. That makes the executive frightened and anxious to eliminate Andrew and all other robots with the same programming.(note The rest of this review contains spoilers.) With Sir's coaching and example, however, Andrew metamorphoses over the next two hundred years. First, an android (artificial human) and then eventually, makes himself into a fully functional human being. To do so, he creates artificial organs. These same organs can be used in people, which turns them into androids, too (the proper term is cyborg, which comes from cybernetic organism).At the end of the movie, Andrew wants to die. At first, I felt that this idea was totally nonhuman and therefore, out of character. After all, most humans would envy Andrew's immortality. Nevertheless, after looking at it from Andrews's prospective, it made complete sense. First, his death would allay his detractor's fear, because he would no longer be superior. His enemies would not have to disassemble or reprogram a robot that is no longer functional. Second, he would fulfill his ambition to be just like his owner. Third, he would prove to himself that he was human by breaking the first law of robotics.  I think that why it did not matter that he dies before hearing himself declared human. He already knew.Shortly after Andrew dies, his human wife orders the robot nurse to allow her to die by turning off her life support.  By obeying, the robot violates the first law of robotics. At first I thought this was a mistake. Later, I realized, that robot nurse was also becoming human.

For example, the movie is running in cinemas and people overrate somewhat. In the case of Bicentennial Man I have found no good reason to see it this underrated compared with movies of similar rating. Maybe the lack of hard-core action, guts and R&B moves have let this movie down in the ratings, but to me it certainly rates higher than 99% of all Star Trek movies and Next Generation series (the latter having a similar character, Data, who tries to be human).OK, lets have some detail. First of all, the pacing of the movie. I've seen some comments on this movie being too long, too dragging. No, when the tale is about life and death, and the human condition, longer is often better a simple sound-bite doesn't quite do it. In the same vein, 2001 A Space Odyssey, is often underrated.Then the content it touches quite strongly on our human condition and maybe it is simplified somewhat. When compared with other movies which circle around the existential movement, one could certainly emphasize this. But let us not forget that this movie is made for a broad audience. Having read Nietsche, Heidegger or Foucault should not be a requirement for the audience this movie is targeting. The exact opposite could be said it should be the prequel to read important works by the talented authors in both literature and philosophy.We can certainly see the different stages of self-consciousness artistic development, personal freedom, social acknowledgment, political and philosophical acknowledgment, to just name a few I've seen in this movie. Can we not appreciate the understanding of these elements in our children? Do we have to compare this movie with the more introspective movies, like Waking Life? Or should we see here a perfect movie for a family audience who is critical on content and a movie which allows a slow enough pace to sit back and think about the elements presented? To sum it up, I certainly believe this movie is worth watching, if only to see a bit of movie magic and a fairy-tale experience. So, don't let that bad rating turn you away, please.

But AFTER they chose a decent story, I don't think anything went right.  The biggest problems - perhaps they are only the most obvious problems - are miscasting, and under-rendering.What made anyone think that Robin Williams should play a robot - in particular, this robot?  It's not that he's bad, it's just that he's so clearly swimming upstream, it makes me wince.  Hugh Grant, Kevin Spacey, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carey ... it's hard to think of ANY other well-known actor who wouldn't have been more appropriate.  They're all so OBVIOUSLY more appropriate one wonders why they weren't asked.  (That is, given that Columbus was casting his net so wide that Robin Williams was a serious candidate in the first place.)  To take a case no-one can quarrel with, Brent Spiner (Data from `Star Trek') does what Robin Williams is trying to do, or ought to have been trying to do, a hundred times better.By `under-rendering' I mean many things.  This is a story that begins AFTER a quiet revolution in the future (robots have become household appliances, at least for the very wealthy) and stretches two hundred years FURTHER into the future.  What does this future look like?  Inasmuch as it looks like anything at all, it looks like the world of today.  But the key clause in that sentences is, `inasmuch as it looks like anything at all'.  Asimov's story makes more positive assertions about what the future is like, than the film, and Columbus had a duty to add detail, at least visual detail, to the story, and sketch a future that felt as if it were more than a cardboard backdrop.  (In retrospect `The Fifth Element' looks as if it had something going for it after all - it at least went to THAT much effort.)  -Oh, every so often we see someone wearing a silly dress, or we see people playing chess with ridiculous non-Staunton pieces that's as far as it goes.  In general the Columbus strategy is to remove details that could pin the setting down to the late twentieth century, not add details that would suggest some other setting.  (The opposite approach can be seen in `A Clockwork Orange'.  Kubrick makes no effort to remove trappings of the 1970s; instead he adds to them.  I know which approach I prefer.  One at least REMEMBERS `A Clockwork Orange'.)But the under-rendering is obvious even if we ignore the setting.  Conversations, the details of personal relationships, the nature of the law these, too, are painted in the most under-nourished and non-committal way.  It's this, I fancy, that made so many people feel that nothing happens.  The story just trundles along, each scene resembling the last (`inasmuch as it resembles anything'), no scene ever igniting or standing out.A minor point I'd like to mention while I'm on the topic the music.  Notice that every piece of music we hear dates to - surprise, surprise - the twentieth century - with two interesting exceptions.  The first is a gorgeous aria (the famous one from `Rusalka') by Antonin Dvorak, which Andrew is entranced by shortly after he is plugged in.  The second is a bit of 21st-century piano music (I presume that's what it is), represented by an original composition by James Horner.  It's a wonder Andrew could bear to listen to it after Dvorak.  The scene in which he and Little Miss play the banal, anaemic melody in octaves is enough to make anyone block his ears and try to imagine something else.  I doubt I have ever heard a weaker tune.  But no somehow, he and Little Miss manage play this wretched four-handed drivel, on and off, for fifteen years.  Fifteen years!  It defies belief that human (or non-human) taste could be so degraded.  (One of Horner's lifeless tunes becomes a song which we hear over the closing credits it's guaranteed to empty a cinema in no time.)You'll gather that there are, indeed, MANY things wrong with this film.  The conclusion is telegraphed too early and too clumsily.  The scene with the two hoodlums - it's in Asimov's story - has been removed; a love story that weakens the whole in too many ways to document, has been added.  (Perhaps this love story appeared when the story was inflated into a novel.  If so, so much the worse for the novel.)  The backbone I mentioned earlier is there, all right, but it must support a great deal of flab.

One of the biggest complaints I had were Andrew's motivations for wanting to be deemed a man in the first place; why throw in the inane love story?  Does Hollywood truly believe that moviegoers will short-circuit if they found themselves sitting through a film where the main character did not have a corresponding 'love interest'?  Andrew did not take a lover in the book - Andrew's desire to be officially considered a man was all about being human, and all of the freedoms that come with being human.  Andrew's journey was a very long one, but he always struggled forward for that reason - not for love, and especially not for the love of one person in particular, which I thought was a ridiculous throwaway and completely changed the point of the whole story.  Andrew (kind of like Data in Star Trek) wants to become human because he feels that is a goal worth achieving; for all of its reasons, because he feels that being human is something unique and special.  Of course, both Andrew and Data may have changed their minds about us had they been forced to at some point sit through this stinkburger.  In the end of the book, Andrew chooses death because gaining mortality is the one last step which at that point separates him from humans.  In the end, Andrew finally achieves his goal, and spends his final hours as the man he had struggled his whole life to become.  He didn't tell jokes (we know Robin Williams is a comedian, it was forced and pointless to showcase that fact), he didn't fall out of windows and run around like an idiot, he never fell in love with anyone (except perhaps the affection he felt for the original 'Little Miss' who he took care of as a child, but the affection was platonic).  If it hadn't been based on the book, this movie would have been simply another forgettable sci-fi failure from that conveyor belt of cookie-cutter, second-rate Hollywood drivel.  Since it is based on the book it's a complete travesty; Asimov must have twisted in his grave when this thing hit the theaters.  It has probably also ensured that fans of the original will never see it done right.

He's the guy most people enjoy on screen when they want a good laugh. In fact, he's done a good job at being versatile as well. Williams has also shown that he can play very serious roles that involve a lot of emotion. And this Chris Columbus film is probably one of his most emotional performances. Here, Robin Williams plays a robot named Andrew whose original purpose was to serve mankind. Soon, he becomes self-aware and wants to understand more about what it's like to be human.This triggers a switch in Andrew's mind and from then on, he makes it his goal to do anything he can to be human. It's a very sweet plot that really tugs at the heartstrings. Unfortunately, this is where people may draw the line because the screenplay can get very sappy at times and very emotional. If a viewer likes that kind of material than there should be no problem but because this is about a robot who wants to become human, he's going to have to go through many significant events that many of us regular people have to go through everyday. This will have viewers feel like the story drags on forever. That's the downside to the writing - it can be very sappy and drawn out at times.But for the cast, Robin Williams is very solid. He includes his mix of humor and emotion and performs well. His struggle to understand how to be human is very intimate because many of us can relate to such scenes that involve pain, love and joy. Sadly, he's also the only reason why people would want to go see this because through the running time, new characters come into play every scene which can be tiresome because the audience has to get to know a whole new set of faces. The special effects are good though. So much of it is well blended that it's hard to know what is real and what is CGI. But by far, the most effective element to this movie is James Horner's score. Every scene containing his music is to the point of magical and childlike simultaneously. Extremely emotional music. I would say it's for the true Robin Williams sappy story fans.It has good special effects, excellent music and a performance many Robin Williams fans would love. However, the plot can be drawn out and overly sappy.

While perhaps, artificial intelligence has yet to catch up with the movie's premise of robotics existing side by side with us, the movie's script has important implications for our contemporary society. This mainstream, populist movie is at the same the entertaining and like A.I. (2001), Bicentennial Man has the same sharply photographed and easily but poignant storyline about important issues, in this case about man's mortality and about what makes us human. This movie has aged well and is touching and spans 200 years in our future, with the backdrop fascinating to seen while never being overwhelming to the story itself. The characters while perhaps one-dimensional, each provide archetypes and allows the audience to focus on the story and events not the depth of character which really are not the primary substance of this movie. Robin Williams brings his genius of comedy and humor to the role and in a way the smoothly fits in with the movie.

The first hour of the movie is pure old fashioned fun, and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Yet when you enter the last half of the film, it takes a dramatic turn for the better. A lot of people bashed this film, and even though for the most part it was a box office flop, I believe it to be one of the best romance films I've ever seen.This was the role that Williams was born to play. Before this he was mostly cast in overly clichéd comedies with flawed scripts. He was known for being one of the funniest men in the industry, but he really shows his true colors in this film. While being generally comedic he makes sure that he keeps his character light-hearted and optimistic. He is a robot who wishes to be human, and will never rest until his goal is completed. The defining moments of the movie are not in its comedy, but in its drama and the social conflict Andrew (Williams) faces with trying to change. The final scene of this movie will have tears flowing and the tissues flying. Every time I watch this film, the ending always gets me, its more powerful than Titanic or King Kong, Capote or Gone With The Wind.Supporting Williams in this brilliant film are Sir Richard Martin (Sam Neil), his caring master and provider. Sam Neil notices the extraordinary originality and difference in Andrew from other robots and uses this to teach Andrew of the ways of man. A career high for Sam Neil, he portrays a character both enlightened and later distraught by Andrew. Little Miss Amanda Martin (Embeth Davidtz) is the daughter of Sir Martin who soon befriends and becomes very attached to Andrew. Andrew and Little Miss form a bond that is lovable and innocent. Embeth Davidtz later portrays Portia Charney, the grand-daughter of Little Miss, whom Williams has a hard time dealing with. Oliver Platt performs as Rupert Burns, an intelligent yet underestimated engineer of robots who helps Andrew on his journey to change. His comedic excellence truly lifts this movie and like I said before, makes sure it doesn't take itself too seriously. The other performances in this film support it greatly, whether it is comedic and dramatic.Altogether, I find this to be one fantastic film. I cannot understand now how this movie was so overlooked and bashed by the public and critics alike. I found it to be a gem and one truly heartbreaking yet uplifting movie that brings hope in believing that this world can make the right decisions. Yet it also brings very sad feelings knowing that it can take so long to be acknowledged for what and who one is. The ending of this movie will leave you breathless and simply taken aback. Trust me, forget all of the things you've heard about this film and give it another shot with an open mind and an open heart. This movie deserves to be noticed among some of the greats, as it is a beautiful portrait of life outside human existence, and how one man can change the way the entire world views one thing. I hope this review was helpful, and In the words of the great Andrew Martin, one is glad to be of service.

The current 'in thing' is to have a robot that does tasks such as housework and cooking. The Martin family have just got their own robot, and decide to call him Andrew. It seems as if the Father is the only one that really likes having Andrew around, one child is scared of it, the other hates it. And the Mother seems very uncomfortable with Andrew around. One night the oldest daughter causes Andrew to brake himself. And from then on Andrew shows signs of intelligence. Is this machine capable of intelligence and human emotions?Andrew quickly becomes apart of the family. Bonding mostly with the Father ('Sir') and the youngest daughter (Little Miss').The film follows the 'life' of Andrew and the humans around him. The family grow up and get older, but Andrew of course stays the same. The first time jump is amazing.I must mention the make-up, costumes and the sets. As the film is set over a long time period the humans age. And what a job the make-up artists did! Sometimes you feel as if the movie was made over a long period of time and the actors aged naturally! As the film is set in the future the clothes have changed slighty from the present. Most of the clothes aren't that typical future clothing stereotype of white or silver jump suits (thank goodness!). The clothes look futuristic without being over the top. The sets are a real treat later in the movie. I especially liked the set in the last scene. Somehow it feels like something Kubrick would do. The special effects are also wonderful. Look out for some American icons spruced up in the future. Amazing!I felt this movie was rather poorly marketed. It seems as if it was being sold as a comedy and a children's movie. Firstly, while there are a lot of funny moments I wouldn't really call it a comedy. And it doesn't seem like a kids movie either. I was also surprised to hear the s word used a few times.The film starts of a little slow, but give it a chance, it gets better with time. I particularly enjoyed Robin Williams performance, although everyone put in a good job.If I have a complaint it would be the portrayal of the oldest daughter.

Let me just say that this movie was far better than I ever imagined it would be.  First surprise, Robin Williams in a totally serious role.  True, there are funny points, but they are not due to Robin Williams' patented quick gag style.  Second surprise, here is a masterful story with equally masterful acting.  I wouldn't have been so surprised though if I had known that the story comes from Isaac Asimov. This movie shows an anomoly in a robot named Andrew that makes him creative and therefore unique.  This uniqueness eventually leads him to start his search to become more humanity.  This begins slowly, showing him first acting like a human by earning money, and on a quest for new knowledge. Next he searches for others like him, decides there are none and then starts his new quest to look more human.  After acquiring skin so that he looks human, he next works towards developing his relationships with humans in the family he was first adopted by.  This next leads to his desire for feelings/senses. Slowly he begins a step by step process towards becoming human.  Now, I don't want to give away the whole movie, but this is a must-see.  It will touch you and let you appreciate what you have as a human as you see Andrew's joy in achieving each small piece of humanity that we all possess.  You will see how he has to deal with being ostracized by most humans and loved by those precious few, such as his master at the beginning of the movie, that see him for what he truly is and are not threatened by him.  This will have you asking yourself which one you would be and taking a close look at your own humanity.  Go out and watch this and be amazed!

In the main, the difficult ethical questions were side-stepped in favour of observing one character's personal development. It would have been nice to have seen more of the negative reactions from people towards 'robot rights.' What would have happened if more robots developed sentience? Would the courts be so willing to grant robots status as human beings if there were lots of them? If robots are considered human because they contain some parts that are the same as those of organ transplant recipients, does this mean that you could construct a robot from scratch and make an instant human?

Embeth Davitz reminded me very much of Annabella Sciorra, who co-starred on an equal plane and with equal talent to perennial leading man, Robin Williams in What Dreams May Come.  Bicentennial Man is nothing new in terms of plot.  It is Pinocchio, but it is a mature Pinocchio, whose humanity is not so quick to obtain.  The film spans four generations, beginning in 2005.  Other than softcore robotics, there is little in the way of science fiction and none of the imaginatronic backdrops that the most recent Trek and Star Wars films have spawned.   Science fiction is purely the McGuffin as Hitchcock used to say.  It is the reason the characters interact, but not intrinsic to the basic elements of how the story unfolds. The tale might just as well have been about a working man aspiring to aristocracy.  There are a few plot holes and letdowns, though.  For instance, android Williams searches the world for twenty years on foot for another sentient anomaly like himself, only to find the only possibility, a hip-swaying, jazzed-out femdroid back where his journey began.  Meanwhile, Davitz's dual role as Little Miss and her granddaughter, Portia, are subject to the ill-conceived scripting of having them both appear alive at the same time, so that there is no possibility that the one might be the reincarnation of the other, who loved Andrew beyond the depths of his positronic brain.  There is also some mistoying with the presumably villainous robotics corporation owner, who never really develops into evility beyond a voiced desire to disassemble the robot for fear its emotions might affect sales.  All in all, though, it is a warm and brilliant film, which tickles the funny bone and tears at the heart.

The fantastic world where robots may struggle to gain a foothold in society is only glanced at for establishing shots and also to take us out of the world of talking heads.

Instead he knows about it all ready. Instead he comes to understand human emotions and what it means to be human. At first it deals with him looking like a human and having the rights of a human, but in the end he realises that to be human, he must die. As such, upon his death bed, he is finally proclaimed a human.From what I know of the book (as I have not read it) the battles deal more with him begin legally declared a human. This exists in this movie, but the legal battles occur infrequently, and the movie deals more with his understanding of himself, his relationships with others, and his desire to be human. This desire isn't evident at the beginning, but when he begins his search for his destiny, he soon comes to desire to be more human. In fact, upon meeting Porscha, the grand-daughter of his favourite Little Miss, he desires to become even more human. In fact, he not only takes a central nervous system, but he gives himself the ability to die along with the one he loves.In the end, this movie is very sentimental and emotional. It is idealistic and is the type of movie that one would watch with one's partner. It is sort of a love story, but moreso it is an idealistic, sentimental movie with a happy ending not really the style that I like. It deals with the character much more that what the character is trying to do. It looks at him inside rather than those looking in at him. He is making himself human as opposed to humans declaring him human.The one problem is where a robot commits euthanasia. The first law of robotics is that a robot may not harm, or allow a human to come to harm. The second law is that a robot must obey a human. The question is whether euthanasia is allowing a human to come to harm. In fact it is harming, but is turning off a machine allowing a human to come to harm? It is not entirely clear, but that struck me at the end.

Whenever it comes on TV I just can't resist watching it through till the end. Robin Williams gives a fine performance and the story is more profound than is perhaps apparent at first.After all, it is possible that robots that are so convincing that we would have problems telling them apart from ourselves may be a reality within the lifetime of some people living today. How this will affect us and whether we will form emotional relationships with them is an undeniably fascinating question.The film does a good job of exploring some of these issues and brings out the differences or similarities between ourselves and what we call machines. It considers how machines that resemble us may cause us to confront prejudice against non-human intelligence and looks at how our mortality might affect machines that may one day become as complex as us.Bicentennial Man cleverly wraps this philosophy into a great feel-good movie and if it tends to sentimentality I don't mind, cos it's great family entertainment.

Sometimes it goes over the edge into excessive sentimentality, Hollywood-style. However, the key to the film's success in my opinion was the inspired casting of Embeth Davidtz, who plays both Little Miss and her granddaughter Portia. The sincerity of Davidtz's performance frankly saves an implausible situation from descending into farce, namely the genuine love of an organic woman for a mechanical man. Robin Williams does very well as the mechanical robot 'Andrew Martin' who has a design flaw which enables him to develop emotions. Over the course of 200 years, Williams is progressively made more and more organic by upgrades, so that the lines become seriously blurred between 'robot' and 'human'. Since this is what will inevitably occur in the future, we need to start thinking about it now. The film is based upon a story and a novel by sci fi writer Isaac Asimov. Williams's owner and father-figure is played with sublime blandness and tolerance by Sam Neill, who is as soothing a presence as castor oil in the gut, and he just makes the story go down. There are some who believe that organo-robots already exist, but that is another story, and one impossible to prove. Be that as it may, they WILL exist. And who is to say we are not already all organo-robots ourselves? Think about it. After all, most of our actions are driven by hormones and inarticulate subconscious impulses. So where is our much-vaunted 'will', those of us who boast about being 'humans'? Robin Williams has tried very hard to play this straight, and although I don't know if he really got the tone right at all times, and let's face it, he was up against an almost impossible task in making a machine into a man within the space of two hours and 12 minutes, this film despite any faults it may have is damned important. It is not at all 'in your face' and tries not to be too provocative. In fact, it tries to be a great love story. I don't know whether that sentimental approach was the best way to go, but I suppose they were trying to appeal to everygal. In any case, this film is 'worthy' in the sense that it is seriously intended and is not just an exploitation piece. It therefore deserves serious attention and consideration, and also a lot of respect.

It is a movie about a robot's search for an identity, but at the same time it is about love, aging, individuality, and even greed. The movie also succeeds in creating spellbinding images of the weddings and the romantic dances. It was also exciting to watch the visions of the world in the 22nd and 23rd centuries but at the same time, the nuts and bolts aspects were deftly restrained (other movies set years in the future, such as The Fifth Element sometimes go gaudily overboard in depicting the future). Andrew's romance with Portia was also touching and believable though I did not think about this while the movie ran. Overall, this is one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen and one of Robin William's best performances. I would love to read an interview with him about it.

When I first saw it a few years back I admit that I didn't like it much, it seemed rather stupid to think that a robot could 'become' human, but on viewing it again years later, I can safely say that I missed the whole point of this film.Andrew is a robot to begin with, but one with feelings and the ability to learn. He wants to learn, wants to talk, wants to create, and through some mistake when he was being created he can. His unique ability, mixed with his owners kindness and help allow him to grow up like a real human, by learning, having memories, caring about his family etc.This film shows Andrew's aim to become human, and follows his life from when he first became the 'machine' of the Martin family, to when he finally fell in love with their youngest daughters grand child, and becomes human to die beside her on their death beds.It is a sad movie, with a few tear jerking parts (especailly at the end) and it asks a lot of questions which we don't often think about, like can robots have feelings, can they love, and can they become human? In the end, what does defy whether you are a human or not, is it being born with the right, or can you earn the title.This is a definite 5 for me. true, it is a very long film and the start can drag on a bit, but it is a beautiful tale that I believe everyone should watch at least once.

Unfortunately, when it tries to be anything else, it rather flunks out.For me; Robin Williams is the kiss of death to any movie. That sherbet-lemon-sucker's smiling-with-pain, I've-got-my-heart-on-my-sleeve expression is just a bit too much of a good thing. I liked him in 'Good Morning, Vietnam.' The idea and his character worked well there. Unfortunately, since then he seems to have been typecast. Every subsequent role he has played has entailed a bigger and bigger bag of sherbet lemons. Lachrymosity has become his trademark.The coming of self-awareness amongst robots - or at least, computers - is a concept which has been evaluated in any number of movies, and with every kind of prognosis. Though I still suspect it will catch us largely unprepared both socially and morally when it happens. Here, Williams plays a robot that is different in some indefinable way. And - indulged by its kindly owner, who gives it ever-greater latitude - the thing embarks upon a journey of self-realisation. It has difficulty coming to terms with the passage of time. Humans grow up and grow old, while the robot remains constant, unaffected by age. This area of the story is well-handled, but when the robot wants to become more human and when it starts to fancy its owner's younger child; the scenario becomes rather inept and also slightly sinister. There are overtones of 'Demon Seed' (1977). But - Hey; you can see what'll happen a mile away it's going to BECOME human in the end. And you know it will succeed because this is Robin Williams, Captain Lachrymosity, and if he doesn't get his own way he will almost certainly weep till he rusts. This scenario requires a progressive suspension of belief both at his increasingly improbable and bizarre modifications and the attitudes of commerce and law. Handled more objectively - which means a little more cruelly - the story could have been a bit more believable, but then it would have called for a part that Mr Williams manifestly cannot play (without him, I'd have awarded at least another star). But the thing must stumble on, for his sake if no other, to its ultimate and implausible conclusion.The evaluation of affection is particularly strange. This robot seems able to transfer its preference from daughter to grand-daughter at the drop of a hat, which surely cheapens the very sincerity for which it supposedly strives. Further; whilst the robot may indeed have a uniquely intuitive glitch, how did it identify with its own sexuality? Intelligence and sexual identity are two completely different issues. It is reasonable to suppose that the former might be artificially replicated, but how does one impart a billion-year-old evolved instinct to an electrical appliance? Here, the movie-makers fell into their own anthropomorphic trap. The very trap that the robotics executive warned them against and for which he was subsequently ridiculed. Just because it looked like a man, didn't make it a man, or imbue it with male instincts and feelings. The thing was first and foremost a machine. It was a completely original invention with no ancient genetic archive to draw upon and guide its behaviour. The thing might as easily have been gay. Or something else as yet completely unimagined.Neither do I much care for the treatment of 'Galatea'. She is represented as the epitome of chauvinist evaluation the female as a sexual object, tease and flirt. And when it becomes irritating even to our proto-human hero, he attacks it with a power drill and we hear it screaming. Apparently, domestic violence is also intrinsic to the 'male' machine. And equally justified. Remind me about the 3 laws of robotics, again.And can a robot really make 10 times as much as a corporate executive by building ornamental clocks out of scrap wood? I don't think so - not unless it's called Damien Hirst.Finally, I don't believe I ever heard an orchestra lay-on the sentimental strings quite so thickly. If anything they demonstrate how the mood of a movie and its audience can be manipulated by the sound-track. Cloying, turgid, over-sentimental, pretty unbelievable, and above all - inept, but with some well-observed incidental details about relationships and the passage of time. Watch it if its there and you've nothing better to do.

Andrew Martin is an android purchased by the wealthy Martin family in 2005. Over the course of 200 years, the sentient robot learns from his human tutors and desires to be recognized as a human as well. Similar to the Data character on STAR TREK-TNG, but not so dry. As expected, many liberties are taken with the book. Many of the characters' are straight from the book, but are given the Spielberg treatment (early 1980s Spielberg; Twilight Zone The Movie-era). Many of the novel's comments on racism (Andrew's ridicule by thugs for wearing clothes, for example) are either absent or softened considerably. At this point, it sounds like I'm going to tear this movie to shreds, but I'm not. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. Robin Williams gives a performance that's a cross between Data and the Wizard of Oz' Tin Man. The early stage robot costumes are remarkable; they look like something you'd get from a Sharper Image Christmas catalog! James Horner's music is at times derivative from his earlier work (echoes of COCOON and BRAVEHEART), but still gets the job done. Sam Neill as Martin family patriarch Sir Martin is a good straight-man to Robin Williams' Andrew. Early on, you sense Williams chafing at his restraints at times, but it fits a character initially condemned to servitude. Later, Andrew evolves and (while not aging himself) begins to experience the loss of others. Emotions stir within him until, over time, Andrew desires to become more outwardly human (eliminating the no-doubt cumbersome robo-gear) as well. He soon meets an eccentric inventor (played memorably by Oliver Platt) and his obnoxious robot assistant, Galatea (entirely a creation of the filmmakers)and wants to experience the full range of human emotion and sensation. The two become instant allies in Andrew's quest for recognition of his humanity. Galatea (for a while, at least) is this film's Jar-Jar. Perky and cutesy to the point of viewer rage! A terrific bit involves Andrew going after her with a sander power tool! Later on, Andrew falls in love (again--not in the book) with the granddaughter of his former master's daughter, Little Miss. They have an obnoxious cute-meet (damn, I really HATE those! Ooh, he's soo annoying; I think I love him! kind-of-crap), but soon the relationship gains depth (issues about mortality arise; Andrew will, by design, outlive his human lover). Andrew then makes a decision to do something about this; leading to the film's heart-wrenching conclusion. I must say, the ending had my wife and I pretty misty! And it's earned emotion, too. By giving the film a more leisurely pace (befitting it's lead character's initial immortal status), director Chris Columbus (a decent, family-movie, craftsman-level director) let's us invest in these characters (even Galatea is redeemed by movie's end! Take that, Jar-Jar!). An enjoyable film (with an occasional annoying moment here and there) that, like the Tin Man, wears its shiny, red heart for all to see. And sometimes, that's not always a bad thing. "},{"Title":"Terrible wars have been fought where millions have died for one idea, freedom.

Perhaps the final product differed from what critics and audiences were expecting. After all, any film starring Robin Williams (in the years before dark streak &#150; 'Insomnia,' 'One Hour Photo') could quite reasonably be expected to be a hilarious, all-out comedy, which this is not. 'Bicentennial Man,' despite having a few amusing moments, is played largely for sentimentality, and this is to be expected, considering the reputation of its director. No doubt, also, that many children were dragged along to what parents were anticipating to be an enjoyable family film. Quite frankly, there is plenty of material that would not be ideally suited to the very young, including discussions of sex and a few unexpected expletives. Nonetheless, the film is ultimately very innocent and enjoyable, with a heartwarming message of freedom, love and belonging.William plays Andrew, a household android of the NDR series, who is purchased by Richard Martin (Sam Neill) and his family in April, 2005. Despite some friction between Andrew and several of the family members (particularly the elder daughter, Lindze Letherman), he eventually becomes a valued member of the Martin family, revealing a capability for creativity and emotion that is unique to his kind. Andrew strikes up a life-long friendship with the youngest daughter, Little Miss (Hallie Kate Eisenberg, later Embeth Davidtz), though, being immortal, the ravages of time soon take their tolls on all those he knows and cares about. Above all else, Andrew strives to become human, eventually sacrificing his own immortality for the opportunity to be considered a real person. At its core, the film is a science-fiction retelling of the story of Pinocchio, with a love story thrown in for good measure.Robin Williams is excellent in the main role, giving his character the likable innocence and (im)perfect comedic timing that the role requires. This is especially notable because Williams spends the entire first half of the film in an android costume, with his metallic face still showing a surprisingly wide range of emotions. Sam Neill is also very good, though it's unfortunate that his character is only present for the first section of the film. Embeth Davidtz (who plays two pivotal characters) is adequate enough, thought not particularly noteworthy. Oliver Platt is quite good as Rupert Burns, the fund-deficient mechanical geek who dedicates a lot of his life to making Andrew human, giving him a face, skin, organs, and ultimately the ability to die.Considering the futuristic setting, special effects are used surprisingly sparingly, with Columbus opting for impeccably-designed film sets or more traditional settings over extravagant visuals. Andrew lives for almost exactly 200 years (hence, the title 'Bicentennial Man'), and the implications of this &#150; particularly that Andrew eventually loses all those that are dear to him &#150; are exploited for maximum emotional resonance, even if the film is overly-sentimental on many occasions. The themes of the film, and the basic story of an android learning to love and striving to be human, were later used (to greater effect) by Steven Spielberg for 'Artificial Intelligence AI (2001).' Nonetheless, 'Bicentennial Man' is a nice film to watch, and is well worth a look, if only for being such an ambitious undertaking for the director and star.

True SF, in the vein of A.I. - Artificial Intelligence or Gattaca, thankfully eschewing the appalling incoherence and bombast of such abominations as Alex Proyas's I, Robot.Director Chris Columbus was a great fit, because his movies are always heart-warming and family-friendly, and Bicentennial Man focuses on the human heart and the human family. Its overt sentimentalism is not a drawback, but a virtue, since the film explores the very issue of what constitutes being human, and human emotions take center stage in the story. Robin Williams was also a good choice for Andrew's role, and he gives one of his warmest, most stylish performances here.As one critic (William Arnold) put it Bicentennial Man is 'more true to the spirit of the Golden Age of science-fiction writing than possibly any other movie of the '90s'.

This film is widely considered to be a comedy movie, the very one that you can watch with your family seating in front of the TV-set and eating pop-corn. Looking more deeply, I think it can be named drama as well as comedy. This film is unusually harmonious in spite of the fact that we are shown a very technological and affluent society in future with all those magnetically levitated trains,personal robots and smart systems surrounding people. Moreover, future in this film does not seem to be scaring. When you watch this particular film you simply plunge into the world of future that gives you so many philosophic topics to think over. So the plot is rather thought-provoking. A robot that is supposed to be responsible for household chores and carry out orders of members of the Martin family turned out to possess human emotions and even art abilities. While the story progresses Andrew, the robot, gets more and more human features. Sometimes you can even find him more humane and emotional then people. The main character Andrew is unique, it was said in the film a number of times. He is a robot with a human soul, sensitive to other people and the world itself. During two centuries of his life he faces a lot of problems starting from people's misunderstanding and continuing to loneliness and despair of a lover. This role was brilliantly played by Robin Williams. As a true fan of Robin William I am sure to say that this is one of his best roles. I really appreciate his talent and I think anyone would feel the same feeling watching this film. The acting is astonishing. In the first part of the film he managed to reveal the character of Martin without being able to show his mimicry. I was able to understand the emotions clearly and become involved into the atmosphere of the film. I can't mention the other actors. On the whole, I can say, they were cast approximately. Their acting was quite convincing. But Hallie Kate Eisenberg, the girl that played Little Miss Amanda, is my favorite in this film. I wonder, how it was possible for a little girl to reveal the character so perfectly. The thing I not quite satisfied with is special effects. It seems, that in a movie about future we need more details about technology to plunge into the atmosphere fully. In the first part of the film almost all event took place in the Martin's house. I wonder, why not show us something interesting about the future. So the beginning was rather boring and tedious. Though the proper acting saved the beginning. Nevertheless, the messages of this film play the most important role. While watching the film, many philosophic topics come to our mind, such as love, friendship, humanism, death, sense of life and many other. This film helps people to think a little about their life, about their relationships with the world and with their close people. After watching the film, I couldn't even talk, because I was so much impressed by it. I thought about the future, it doesn't scare me if we talk about technology. The thing I'm worried about is the human nature of people. I think a lot of people no longer take care of others. They think about themselves only, there is too much ego in their life. I wish it changed. I strongly recommend everyone to watch Bicentennial Man. It is certainly one of the best ways to spend your time. I hope, the film will make you think your life over and start to change our future from now.

What do you think about robots? Would you like to have one at home? Chris Columbus gives his own answers to these questions in the film Bicentennial Man. This film is based on a book, written by Isaak Azimov, who is famous for his stories about robots. The topics which the film brings up, are simple and clear even for a child. But it doesn't mean that the story itself is simple, the other way round, the story tells us about things which are considered to be the main morality, love, family. We cannot but feel all the emotions which are expressed in the film, because all of them are quite familiar to us. The story of a robot who spent 200 years to become a simple man seems to be very strange in some way. Many people would give everything to be immortal, but not Andrew. For me, this robot is more humane then any human and through the entire story I waited for him to understand it and accept himself. The actor, who played the main part, is Robbin Williams. His portrayal of a robot can be called even genial. Every scene, where he appeared, is full of humour, charm and positive. This is one of my favorite actors because of his ability to express different emotions with his eyes and smile and this film can serve as a perfect example. Another thing I like about this film is music. It helps us to feel all the emotions, to understand characters. I think here I can say only one name to make everything clear. Celine Dion. Her song is perfect for this film and now it is one of my favorite. You know, I'm always skeptical t the films about future, it always seem artificial or exaggerated, but Bicentennial Man is a different one. Being a sci-fi this film, it tells us a story of a man, of his dreams, and for me it is more drama, then film about robots. Of course, there are no sufferings or complicated lives, everything is quite simple, but it makes this film suitable for everyone. And if you have any hesitations whether to watch it, you definitely should watch!

Movies about robots and all this things that are connected with our future have always been interesting for me as I want to know what will be with our planet in several centuries. Bicentennial man is a 1999 Canadian-American science fiction family comedy-drama film starring Robin Williams,Sam Neill, Embeth Davidtz (in a dual role), Wendy Crewson, and Oliver Platt. Based on the novel The Positronic Man, co-written by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg, which is itself based on Asimov's original novella titled The Bicentennial Man, the plot explores issues of humanity, slavery, prejudice, maturity, intellectual freedom, conformity,sex, love, and mortality. The film, a co-production between Touchstone Pictures and Columbia Pictures, was directed by Chris Columbus. The title comes from the main character existing to the age of two hundred years, and Asimov's novella was published in the year that the U.S. had its bicentennial. The basic plot (without giving away too much) is that, in the near future, a wealthy family purchases a robotic servant&#x97;a household appliance built for doing household chores and such. The name Andrew is given to it by the youngest member of the household. Because of a fault in this particular robot's positronic brain Andrew begins doing things he was not programmed for. He develops the ability of creating beautiful valuable art and woodworking talents. He even enjoys creating such things as wooden animals for the family he belongs to. As Andrew grows in awareness, he begins to realize that he will never be related to and accepted as an equal in the world of humans as long as he looks like a machine.Gradually, as technology advances over 200 years, Andrew at first purchases, and later invents for himself upgrades and adaptations for his body that make him more human looking, but regardless of what he does, the humans he cares for the most continue to think of him as a machine, and therefore are incapable of returning love and affection to him.To make a long story short,this film is all about Andrew's long quest to find out what it means to be a man. There are no many special effects, but the view of the city full of robots,flying cars,metallic skyscrapers, and all-white hospital interiors is superb. While watching this film, you soak up the atmosphere and really feel like you have entered the future world. The acting is very well done. I appreciate that Robin Williams , in one of his bizarre roles, portrays Andrew very similar to a natural robot. He is absolutely enchanting and his acting seems rather convincing to me. His comedic talents makes this movie more entertaining and suitable almost for all ages. These laughable and hilarious situations are appropriate and very well done. I enjoyed it a lot. In 1998, Williams won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Dr. Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting. He also received two Primetime Emmy Awards, six Golden Globe Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and four Grammy Awards throughout his career, and was inducted as a Disney Legend in 2009. I also liked the acting of Hallie Kate Eisenberg.She played such a wonderful and cute little daughter of this reach family.I could not but fall in love with her at first sight.All in all, I can say that all the actors are perfect. Bicentennial man achieves grand heights as a well made and magical production. It's not quite a masterpiece, but it's not far off. Well, I must say that the first half is really enjoyable indeed. I loved the prevailing unusual atmosphere and I waited for something unpredictable and thrilling to happen. But it seems strange to me how unexpectedly the film goes wrong. The second half of the movie changes tone,it slowly abandons its most promising themes and paradoxes, and turned out to be a series of slow, soppy scenes involving love and death. The question of whether Andrew did actually become a living being or not is left to the viewer to decide. So,then it must be interesting for all of us to find it out.I think it is possible to believe that something like Andrew could ever be created by men. But the point of the story is not so much to tell a story of what might actually happen as to arouse thinking about what makes a person a person, and what is important and wonderful about being one. Bicentennial man is a very deep and thought- provoking film to watch!

The film is about an android named Andrew(Williams)who happens to be a family robot and works for a guy(played by Sam Neil from The Vow)who bought Andrew for his family. Of course later on in the film Neil's charchter dies and Andrew happens to have human emotions so Andrew goes on a mission to see is there anyone like him in this world and surprisingly he decides to make himself human. Now living life as a human he gets to witness falling in love(with a girl called Portia played by Embeth Davidz from The Amazing Spiderman who also plays 2 parts in this movie)and show emotions just like a real human being,but will he ever get to become and act like a real human being like aging for example?This film reminds me of A.I with Haley Joel Osmont about a robot who is desperate to become human. Its not the best Robin Williams I have seen and parts of this film did remind me of Mrs Doubtfire(since Chris Columbus directed both films). But the real reward that this film has of course goes to the make up effects. I was in shock how the same make up artist who did Mrs Doubtfire and The Mask was able to transform Robin Williams into an old man in the end of the film. It was so well done so thumbs up to this. The film though itself is a tad bit long and it gets kinda boring from time to time but if you wanna check it out then do.5/10 "},{"Title":"A highly underrated masterpiece","Date":"29 September 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" This movie is one of the more horribly mis-marketed cinematic productions ever. This movie is ground-breaking and considering the subject matter will likely always be to an extent. It is very well-acted, and even during the bits that should have been more thoughtfully crafted (beginning, early middle) the production has a tremendous payout for those that brave through to later segments.Topics of extreme relevance within are humanity; slavery; freedom; AI with respect to humanity, slavery and freedom; time, consequence, and of course love.If you are a lover of film or Isaac Asimov, this one is surely for you. Acting and direction were supreme, with memorable career- inspiring performances by Robin Williams, Sam Neill, Embeth Davidtz, and Oliver Platt too. A special nod to prolific secondary actor Stephen Root's small role also (you'll remember him better as Milton in Office Space, but he nails his part -- as always).Since being properly introduced to this film which I never intended to watch (as stated it was very poorly marketed), I have re-watched it easily a dozen times... despite being quite a long feature. This is because it moves me in a way few other films have been able to, and I watch lots and lots of movies and TV.Robin Williams was a great, and for me this is still my favorite feature starring him -- and given his body of work that is truly saying something.

A movie about the blurring line between human and creation, man and machine, organic and electric. In my opinion people seem to dismiss this movie because they go in expecting a typical robot film, which are usually rather action-oriented and much more futuristic. Instead Bicentennial Man tries to take a more comforting route, taking place in the not too distant future. This suits the movie rather well, because the themes and goals are more thoughtful and sympathetic in nature.The story follows the life or existence of one Andrew Martin, who happens to have been born as a robot, an android. What separates Andrew from others of his kind is the unexpected spark of creativity within him. A spark that develops and is nurtured until it gets really difficult to claim that Andrew isn't, for all intents and purposes, a human being.And that's pretty much it. It's a rather simple story, told through snippets, with long time skips in between, but yet it all rings true. A lot of this is thanks to Robin Williams grounding performance. Simply his voice fills Andrew with kindness and presence. The rest of the cast are equally up to the task, Sam Neill as the head of Andrew's original family deserving a special mention.This is a great movie to watch if you're a fan of Asimovian robotics or if you're looking for a warm-hearted scifi movie in general. "},{"Title":"A sweeping sci-fi fable, painted in broad strokes but rich with ideas","Date":"4 January 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":" Bicentennial Man tells the story of Andrew (Robin Williams), an android who begins his existence as a servant for the Martin family in an exurb of San Francisco in 2005. His owner, Richard Martin, or Sir (Sam Neill), immediately realizes that Andrew's compassionate personality and creative spirit are something special, and the rest of the film chronicles Andrew's 200-year soul search as he watches times change and loved ones come and go. The film is essentially constructed as a sci-fi fable about what it means to be human, which is why I think a lot of critics and reviewers are missing the point when they criticize the swift pacing, simplistic plot, and relatively shallow supporting characters. This film is first and foremost about Andrew's journey, and the plot and supporting characters are supposed to take a back seat to its broad, sweeping emotionality. That's how fables operate, and Bicentenntial Man never pretends to aspire to realism. Another reviewer mentioned that the film explores the transience of life, and I think that's a perfect way to describe the theme at the heart of the film. It's a theme for which the film's thick, much-maligned sentimentality is a strength, not a weakness, and it does a beautiful job of illustrating the poignancy of human experience and mortality. Watching our friends, acquaintances, and loved ones change and drift away over time is sad and inevitable. So as Andrew watches his family change, age, and pass away, it's profoundly moving. The film excels most when it taps into deep wells of human emotion in service of Andrew's story. In one scene, he watches Sir and Ma'am (Wendy Crewson) enjoy a laugh by the pool, bathed in warm sunlight. In another, Andrew plays back a recording of Little Miss's (Embeth Davidtz) wedding and shares a brief conversation with Sir. At later points, he visits both Sir and Little Miss on their deathbeds. These types of scenes occur throughout the film, and they are so moving because they illustrate the joys and richness of life's relationships and experiences, while at the same time highlighting the pain of losing those things to time and death. Viewing these events at first through a non-human perspective, and then eventually seeing Andrew experience these emotions himself, tugs at the heartstrings in ways movies rarely do.Robin Williams is wonderful as Andrew. The early scenes of Sir teaching Andrew about the human experience are funny (though not laugh-out-loud) and warm, and Williams' performance showcases Andrew's earnestness, attention to detail, eagerness for learning, and affection toward his family in pure and extremely affecting ways. Embeth Davidtz is solid in the dual roles of Little Miss and her granddaughter, Portia. The roles are limited, but she lends warmth and grace to both roles, while preserving the two distinct personalities of her characters. Sam Neill also gives an excellent, thoughtful, and ruminative performance as Sir. The production elements of the film are also top-notch. Instead of being cheesy or schmaltzy, James Horner's soaring musical score is beautifully evocative and nostalgic, lending a poignant timelessness to the visuals (in a similar way to the score of Gattaca, another top-notch sci-fi film). The softness of the film's lighting, especially in earlier scenes by the Martins' pool or on the beach, lends an air of nostalgia and emotionality, and the visual power of the film should not be overlooked. The only flaws I think the movie has are that its script occasionally falls victim to cliché and unoriginality. The changes in tone aren't always seamless, either. But overall, Bicentennial Man is a sweeping sci-fi fable that is both touching and enlightening on multiple levels.

The Martins have a new utility in their home. Their neighbors, or some, already have a robot so Dick Martin finally decides to purchase a unit from Northern Robotics. One of the Martins develops an instant dislike for Andrew right away. She has an instinctive dislike of other things as we see later in the movie. Never having a robotic servant(Andrew is designed for protocol), Martin notices many things about Andrew but perceives none as very unusual until he finds Andrew listening to classical music on an old Victrola Andrew finds out in the yard. The manager of Robotics, Richard Martin, Richard's wife, Little Miss and her sister, and everyone human associated with Andrew grow old as Andrew remains a solid piece of computer manufacturing. Andrew learns many things, he learns about human reproduction, about humor, about the world in general. He has money. He is a member of a family, a family that is not altogether happy, but is decent in most ways, and takes care of Andrew. Andrew is quite taken with Little Miss, in a human way, and this is actually not normal in a robot but there's nothing to do. But if there was, Richard Martin does not intend to change or re-integrate Andrew's circuitry. He does not intend to alter Andrew in any way, although Andrew is very unique. Andrew has fundamental qualities that in theory should not exist in a robot. Time passes and soon Andrew becomes interested in relocating, no longer satisfied in being an android servant of humans. There is humor all through the film, though not an overpowering kind, because step by step Andrew undergoes a transition with the help of a robotic engineer. Andrew has found the apple of his eye, and he will not let anything stand in his way. That apple is NOT Galatea.Rated PG.

You don't ever really know how this future works, as you only get little insight into those things when it is necessary. For example when Andrew the android travels the world in search for androids who are like him. It's unavoidable that you get to see SOME futuristic gadgets but the film never bothers with those things.I find the film to be lacking in the Sci-Fi department. Andrew's initial glimpses of humanity and his progress of becoming more and more like a human being are little convincing. The film just said how it is and rarely cared to give a scientific explanation for it. But one shouldn't overlook how touching the movie is. It is very much about humanity and the robot often serves to theorize about future possibilities for human kind, most notably the possibility of eternal life.

This seemed like a familiar robot gets emotions movie that has been done far too many times. However, it goes a little beyond that and for a little while at least, it was pretty interesting.This is the story of a servant robot that eventually begins to exhibit uncharacteristic creativity and individualism. The story follows him as he passes through generations of the family who first purchased him.I like sci-fi type movies that somehow introduce new ideas or extend on old ones. This is a case of the latter and it does it decently well for the first 3/4 of the movie. The last part is a little botched - so be forewarned, it's not perfect. The acting is pleasant and the characters are reasonably interesting. Robin Williams puts in an uncharacteristically good, serious and non-zany performance.The main attraction of this movie is that it takes a familiar story and extends the consequences further out in time. If this is interesting to you, you might want to check it out.

It's a touching and deep exploration of what defines the human condition. That this exploration is carried out through the mechanism -- so to speak -- of a robot is incidental.The story is a deliberately paced and sentimental depiction of a very special being as he evolves from machine -- a household appliance -- to human over the course of two centuries. The hardest part is understanding and coping with loss as his human family pass away, one after another over the years.A lengthy and unsuccessful quest to find another like himself drives him to undergo one upgrade after another to achieve humanity. But ultimately he fails until he understands that mortality is part of the equation.Williams is brilliant as Andrew, the robot>android>human focal point.

But Bicentennial Man is a film which surpassed my expectations on so many occasions. When Richard Martin buys a household robot for his home and family, he suspects little that the robot he and his family named Andrew is the proud owner of emotions and creativity. As we follow the robots journey through 200 years and five generations, we become engrossed in Andrews struggle to retain his right to be a human being, and his right to die alongside his beloved. Robin Williams stars as all the various stages of Andrew from the moment he's released from the coffin shaped box he arrived in through to the moment of his death as he is finally proclaimed a human being. An amazing epic sci-fi saga of a robot that dares to ask the question What would it be like to be human? Definitely a one not to be missed.

Except this fantastic story, the movie itself never reached to a good height. It's true the movie was a pleasure to watch, a certain tenderness was there all over it, but all because of the story. I don't think the movie is well-directed in this case. In some places it blindly followed the original story where there were much to do for the director e.g. Andrew's first meeting with Portia. Again some places were too much invented by Columbus e.g. the roboticist's workshop.Robin Williams gave a good performance as the robot, Andrew Martin. Even after gaining skin and face like a human body, Williams' acting was brilliantly robotic. The expression change in him after having the ability to feel was finely portrayed by the master actor. Embeth Davidtz also acted quite well. Sam Neill got it right too.The make-up artists did a good job for Andrew. Credits should also go to superb art direction and set designing. James Horner's score over the film added a good serious atmosphere that was very much needed for this type of films. The screenplay, however, was not very satisfying as in some places, in my opinion, there should be a little less dramatic dialogue.In all, this movie is a pleasure to watch.

Moreover, it took me in unexpected ways.Example1  An important point in the movie is that the android Andrew, began making his own money which becomes important later on in the movie but they were able to establish that in about 30 seconds of screen time.Example2  Andrew and Sir ran a running battle with the company that built Andrew that came to a head when Andrew needed his thumb replaced.  This very effective scene got the point across in about 60 seconds of screen time. The next scene moves on and his thumb has been replaced.  We weren't subjected to tedious special effects (of replacing the thumb) that wouldn't have added to story but would have been fodder for trailers.Example3  Just about the time I think Sir is a saint, he takes personal umbrage at Andrew's desire for freedom and effectively bans him from his life.  Emotionally, I wasn't ready for that but in retrospect made the movie much better.Last example  At the end of his 20 year search for another like himself, he finds a female robot that is apparently as unique as he is.  I'm ready for him to find happiness with a soul mate.  He quickly determines, however, that she is just a programmed personality and not the genuine article. That scene a) took about 60 seconds and b) turned left when I was expecting right.One of the best movies ever.  Great acting, sets, technology, and most of all, a wonderfully written script.

Now I realise how imaginative and visionary he really was.Don't misunderstand, Williams himself is not great, his deadpan humour and 'path to enlightenment' are just the characterisation and storyline.But don't take it apart and try to analyse it for all of the metaphors and symbolism and stuff.If you are sensitive and compassionate and giving then I guarantee you will feel wonderful long after the Kleenex have ended.The movie must be viewed holistically. The humanity that 'the robot' tried to accomplish, we take for granted. Although reading some of the comments posted here, you would wonder!I couldn't hold back the tears near the end.

One goes from emotions of laughter one minute to touching pathos the next. One can not come away from this film without feeling that the essence of humanity is something way beyond the mere bag of bones and blood we call our bodies.It is a very very fine adaptation of Asimov's I Robot series, and though the elements of sci-fi are there this is not sci-fi. This movie simply reflects in the shiny, mirrored surface of Andrew the android, all that defines what it is to be human. The movie is a parable and a metaphor both, and comes as a bit of a cross between Pinnochio and Peter Pan. It is a testament to the abilities of Williams that a man who made a career out of doing dick jokes has become not only the finest comedic actor of our time, but one of the finest actors period.

A really fine movie.CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS --I put this film roughly in the same category as Pleasantville and The Truman Show, in that they require you to suspend disbelief to show how, ultimately, it is better to really live and love then die, rather than live a perfect and protected life. I rate all of these 8 of 10.Bicentennial Man starts in 2005, and a new robot, an Android they name Andrew, is delivered to an obviously well-off family. But Andrew is a defective robot. He is not only infinitely intelligent, being able to read and memorize everything, learn to play piano, carve beautiful figures from wood, etc., but he also develops feelings, which none of the other robots do. Robin Williams plays the robot beautifully, and is in costume most of the film.Eventually Andrew realizes that everyone he cares about leaves him - they die. But he is determined to not accept that. First he sets out and wanders all over, for years, searching for another like him. There are none. Returning home, he meets up with who he thinks is Little Miss (Embeth Davidtz), but she doesn't recognize him. Because she is really Portia, a spitting image of her grandmother, Little Miss. That's how long he has been gone.Andrew had been in love with Little Miss when she married 50 or so years earlier, but as just an android could do nothing about it. He falls in love with young Portia and this time is determined. Somewhere in all this, I forget exactly where, he asks for his freedom, not that he wants to leave, or quit serving, but he has learned that freedom is a basic need that all people with feeling desire. He ends up moving away and building his own house along the coast.He finds a workshop of the son of an android pioneer. Andrew first asks to be made to look like a human, so is given a human-looking covering, which then has him looking like Robin Williams. Over the years Andrew invents various ways to make him closer and closer to being human, including a central nervous system so he can feel, and the ability to eat and drink. (Funny scene, in bed with Portia, his stomach growls, then he farts, is surprised, says I'll need to have him make me a muffler.) He also invents many replacement organs that become in widespread use among humans.He goes before the council of SanFrancisco to be declared human. No luck. Much later, around age 200, he has had further modifications which now results in his aging, and wearing out, along with Portia. He goes before the world council, and on his and Portia's deathbeds, sees via TV that he is finally human, then he dies, and Portia asks the nurse to pull the plug.The whole 2-hour film is filled with funny dialog, funny scenes, and interesting insights. But this film is not, strictly speaking, a comedy. It is definitely a serious film, with a real message, but is very entertaining - the novelty is use of a futuristic Android who wants to become human. Robin Williams again does a wonderful job creating a one-of-a-kind character.If you want to look at this film as a nit-picker you can find many little flaws within it. But to focus on that is missing the point entirely. Why even view the film, in that case, because we know there will be no such robots, at least not by 2005? For me, the film works very well and I will remember it for a long time.

Williams had to be robotic yet also human.  This balance was tough, and admirably played, however something just didn't click.  The Asimov books do a much better job at portraying robots that become as human or more so than real humans in character.  'Andrew' got more human through physical augmentation and more overt emotions, but never really seems to cross the 'Pinocchio Transformation Line' so it's hard for his love affair to be believable.I can see why this movie didn't do so well; it was too watered down for die hard sci-fi buffs and not believable enough to draw the chick-flick crowd.On the other hand, stylistically and aesthetically you've got to admire this movie, from the interiors to the futuristic San Francisco.

However, after giving it some thought I rated it pretty high.Robin Williams was in many ways the perfect choice for the lead, and did a fine job. I am a big Asimov fan and have always rated the I, ROBOT series as top-grade SF. I haven't read the series in 20 years, but I think this is sticks close to the books, and certainly in general thought and purpose. I believe Isaac would have liked this. Some of the criticism stemmed from condensing so much into slightly over 2 hours. Would it have worked better as a miniseries?  Yes, and I wished it could have been done that way; unfortunately the money just isn't there in the multi-part series films so they're seldom done, except when the owner (such as Stephen King) has enough clout to insist. Hollywood is a business driven strictly by cost-to-return ratio and almost NEVER by art, except in rare cases where someone with enough money or power can insist -- and the big return is in short crappy films requiring little thought and having lots of action and sex to keep the average viewer (roughly equivalent to a crow or a hamster) interested until the two-hour limit of his attention span.This being said, BICENTENNIAL MAN is the best we can get from Hollywood on a piece like this. Is it a disservice to Asimov's writing? Yes -- but movies always are. I was grateful that it was as good as it was -- which was extremely good -- and not the usual worthless hack job.Keep in mind the limitations of the Hollywood system (and the deteriorated intellectual state of modern filmgoers) and I think you'll agree that this was an exceptionally fine effort.Most people will like this movie a lot.

Namely, the character of Data from Star Trek Next Generation has played to death the Asmovian dilemmas which this movie uses to drive its plot.Consider each of these topics dealt with in Bicentennial Man What are the Morality of Treating Robots as Slaves? Heard that before.  What Is It Like To Experience The Things Humans Do For The First Time, Especially Love? Yeah, we've seen whole episodes of Star Trek about that (not to mention a certain Brad Pitt/Anthony Hopkins movie).  How about, the Robot as Kinless Soul in Search of His Own Kind?  Uh, yeah, think that's been explored. And then there's the question When Does A Machine Really a Human, and Visa-Versa?  Hmm, that's a familiar topic, also.But there was one idea that wasn't as familiar to me the Robot as Immortal Man.  This was where the movie worked best for me.  What a curse it would really be to be immortal!  How many of us really want to live forever?  We would watch our friends and family get old, then die, and another generation take their place, and over and over and over, while we staid the same, and saw our own place in time become just an ancient glimmer--yet we would still be here to remember it, as if it was yesterday.  The thought is absolutely chilling.  That part of the movie is the one that will haunt me.As for the other thinking themes, well, it's not this movie's fault that Star Trek needed to fill seven years of episodes, and relied on exploring the Robot Dilemma for half of them.  After all, the original story is decades older than Data's yellow-eyed portrayal of the Robot's Philosopher's Corner.  But in our post-industrial, Palm-toting cyber-world, I think most of the ideas have moved from beyond seemingly important pabulum, to ho-hum done-that retreads.  I wish this movie had focused most exclusively on the theme of the incredible burden of the soul made by the passing time.  Had it done so, it could have truly been a piece of deep, disturbing art, instead of a mostly forgettable and uneven moment of fluff.

The great effects, Robin Williams, fresh of an Oscar win attached and a semblance of a story. But that is exactly where this film falls short.  The story, the way it fits together is very uneven.  It feels rushed.  The scenes never really have time to develop into anything and what you are left with is a bunch of cute little scenes that never really build into anything.  But I guess that's what you get when you have to span three hundred years with todays impatient audience.And even saying all that, the third act really drags along to a resolution of love that really stretches credibility.  There is no real threat of central conflict that drives the story along.  The search for other's like him is undeveloped; the love story just doesn't hold water, but even saying all that, the film has a faint bit of heart.And the real shame is that things probably got so chopped up in the editing room that we never really get swept away.

We jump forward several more times, watching Andrew react to the new generations of the family for over a hundred years. The story was touchy, but not compelling. It moved around too much for me to feel anything for the android striving to become more human. He has romances for this one character, then the grand-daughter. He wants to become human because he wants freedom, the option to make choices in his own mind. Then he shifts his focus. He wants to become more human, because he loves this woman. Too many things going on and too little time to put it in.Despite that, the movie didn't at least make me turn away. It's an okay film to watch with a loved one. Anytime you throw in Robin Williams in a film, you'll be drawn to watch him. He's bland in this film, but he does give some sympathy to his character. Not his best, but it's watchable.

The actress herself was fine as Portia, later on.I also found that this film dragged and I was wondering WHEN it was going to end, rather than HOW. As a thinking piece, I drastically prefer what dreams may come, which was generally perceived by most people as a flop. Sorry to American readers, but imho this was too full of American mythology about freedom and individuality to be thought-provoking - a kind of 'independence day' without the aliens. Robin Williams was OK, but frankly I prefer him when he's doing something a bit zany-er such as Jumanji or Mrs Doubtfire - although he was also very good in Awakenings.Sam Neill was excellent as usual - he manages to do every part convincingly and you don't see him as Sam Neill but as his character.

Othwerwise, only rent it if you're hangin with a younger bro, sis, niece, nephew, kid you're babysitting, etc. Parents, don't hesitate to watch it with your kids, though. It's definitely not a baby movie. There's only two parts that I can think of that mention sex, but little kids won't get it and it's not bad at all, unless you're *MAJORLY* protective. I mean, it's no Dirty Dancing, give it a break ). Um, they swear, like, two times in the whole movie, that's why it's rated PG. There ya go.

The trailers did little to convey the actual tone of the film, and it's understandable that some people didn't like it.  They were expecting something different.The film has captured Asimov's story perfectly, both in spirit and tone. It's a lengthy movie, but when you consider that it spans 200 years, perhaps that's justified.  Some people have mentioned that it was very slow in parts, and while the film did have a leisurely pace, a lot of that was necessary to allow certain events to properly sink in.Like the book and stories it's based from, the film brings up some very interesting philosophical points based around what it means to be a human. It was extremely faithful to the book, and so long as you come into the movie without false expectations, it's great.

We never went to see it at the theatre because the commercials made it look like a Mrs. Doubtfire as a play-thing robot instead of as a cross-dressing estranged dad.We (and especially I) were surprised to discover that Bicentennial Man is more a relatively faithful adaptation of the Asimov I, Robot novels and not a Christmas family movie about a toy robot. I am a long-time fan of sci-fi and I never had an inkling from the trailers and commercials for this movie that it was this kind of treatment of Asimov. If I were a cartoon, my jaw would have hit the carpeted floor by about half-way through the movie.I think this mismarketing explains some of why Bicentennial Man sort of came and went with little fanfare. I bet the people who saw the commercials and expected a Home Alone type experience left feeling somber and wondering what the heck they just watched. The sci-fi types likely stayed away out of disinterest and fear of seeing Mrs. Doubtfire II Aluminum Nanny.As for me, I watched it only because my wife wanted a light, pick-me-up home movie. As the film went on, I became more interested while she became more confused. I read all the Asimov robot books years ago and I never suspected that was what I would be watching on the screen. This movie is somber, relatively slowly paced and is centered around a basic theme of what constitutes a human, philosophically and legally. My only major knock was the pacing. Some of the scenes really dragged. I was pleased to avoid a long, drawn-out legal battle with lots of onscreen court scenes. Instead, we saw a touching and determined effort by the main character to first develop his humanity and then legally claim it. I found the passage of time depicted in the film especially emotional, but that's probably just me. I have a hard time with the thought that when a person dies so much is lost, yet the world goes on. Here our robot friend learns the same lesson, and eventually decides he doesn't like it, either. But you have to see for yourself how he addresses his unique situation.We rated Bicentennial Man a 6, only because it was a bit slow and a tad too somber. I really wish the studios would get their acts together when it comes to marketing films. They need to learn you can't mash a square peg into a round hole no matter how much you want it to be a family feel-good movie. How's that for an awkward turn of phrase?

Science fiction is the most difficult subject to write about and in the medium of film, even harder.  One just one idea is what generally makes a good movie.  You refine it, explore the possibilities, throw known recognisable characters and then see what happens.  With good SF nothing is (or should be) taken for granted. With Bicentennial Man the scene is the near future, with the 'what if' idea of creating something that has consciences, in something that is not alive or organic.  Unfortunately this was changed to an accidental happening, and Mr Williams character never even wonders about this. Nor did anyone else, he was taken at face value.It would have been a fascinating exercise to ask how would one define a person.  Andrew Martin claimed to be human, yet no one 100's of years in the future had a means of testing that claim.  We are forced to accept the stories premise that if a slow on-going change in a robot will make it human.  No other details like; how does the brain work, why is it accidental?At the end of the film the exact opposite is inferred.  My own take on this is that the progress in technologies would make this inevitable - intelligent conscience machines.I really did enjoy the movie.  It was a lot more than I expected from Hollywood.  It received little advertising here, when it opened several months ago.  Last week it came out on video, so I had another look.  This movie is not about how intelligent machines could be made, but how we react to this as a given fact.  The central concept expressed by Asimov is that humanity can never accept an artificial human intelligence no matter how perfectly human, unless it became mortal.My own feelings are that whenever AI starts and with on going improvements - a hundred years later - wanting to be human would be a step down.The way to recognise good SF is to see how many are p***ed off with the ideas expressed within.  Ninety percent just hate it if they are forced into thinking, the other 10% just love it!Regards Robert "},{"Title":"Heartwarming, yet also asks the big questions","Date":"27 July 2000","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Perhaps its because I'm approaching 50 and the important things in my life have changed, but I found this movie asking profound questions about humanity.

The plot is definetly one of the best science fiction plots I have ever come across, and in fact it would be nice if more science fiction films of this nature were made, instead of Brain Eaters from Planet X 4. The story is definetly classic Issac Asimov, which as any fan of his works would tell you is less about attempting to predict the future, and more about humanity clashing with science. Robin Williams does an excellent job going from being a robot to more human than human, and the rest of the cast does amazing performances as well.

Indeed it is a multi-layered film.  The original story is written by Isaac Asimov a writer I much admire which explains the depth and complexity of the tale.  As for the film it entirely depends on how far off shore intellectually, philosophically, and spiritually one swims.  Stay close to shore in the shallow water where life is simple and hard questions are not at issue and it is funny, moving, tender and touching.  In fact it fairly tugs at the heart.  Venture further out into the deep water where our very humanity is the issue and we find a fish of a different color. That is where the hard questions live.  What does it mean to be human?  Can one start as a machine and end as a human?  And of course the most eternal and perplexing question of all, what about the 'God thing'?  Isaac Asimov was an atheist.  That fact is central because it obviously colored his perspective.  These questions and many more that arise are not only fair game but also essential for mankind to grow and understand itself and how it relates to nature and God.  Precisely because these questions are important and complex they require and deserve minds of great intelligence and wisdom.  Minds willing and eager to do the heavy lifting of philosophically and spiritual contemplation.  Minds that do not take the first pop culture branch in the river.  Only then can we hope to better understand the grandeur and majesty of the questions.  Linked inextricably to that better understanding is reverence and respect for all things spiritual.  Now the problem with this film is that it chucks all that into the Hollywood meat grinder and ends up with 'Sillysausage'.  Understandable, since there is a very large market for 'Sillysausage'.  Let's see who would be likely to have some meaningful insight into the most profound questions of all time?  Robin Williams and Hollywood would not have occurred to me.  There is a rip-roaring pretentiousness about this film.  It chooses to swim far from the shore in the very deepest water.  What constitutes humanity?  Assisted suicide? Etc.  O. K. fair enough, but since it wants to be more than 'Mrs. Doubtfire In Android Drag' let's all play by the same rules.  If you believe that God exists and bother to connect the string of dots this film clearly and proudly presents then it is an affront to Christianity and the dignity of mankind.  Both high profile targets of Leftywood for several decades.  Hey if you are wealthy with no moral moorings and are dead certain that you and your lefty cronies have cornered the market on right and wrong and sure as hell know what feels good who needs this 'God thing' gumming up the works.  Hence the 'God thing' is totally ignored.  That's just as well because it's a sticky problem anyway.  Could if left unchecked lead us astray into dangerous waters.  Why we might even start thinking about and God forbid questioning the false moral authority and poppycock philosophic nonsense that coats this film.  K.I.S.S. keep it simple stupid is alive and well in BM.  There is a 'everything I ever needed to know I learned from my sitcoms' mentality that fairly bubbles and blisters on the screen.  Some machines can be more human than humans.  Evil capitalist businessmen are a given.  Ya Da Ya Da Ya Da, you know the whole routine.  It's a Leftywood golden oldie. They will teach us if we will but listen and learn.  I don't think so, have your people call my people we'll do lunch or better still I'll get back to you on that.

He has a special love for little miss, who is the youngest in the family. But, as she grows up, she gets married, has kids, has grandkids, and finally dies. It's then that Andrew realizes all the ones he loves will be taken away from him one day. And so, Andrew starts his two-hundred year journey to become human. Unfortunately, to become a human, Andrew must first of all become mortal. And that would be the same thing as committing suicide...So that's what this movie is about. The film starts off very funny look out especially for the scene of Andrew's presentation. Also, the scenes where he tries to tell a joke and when he learns how humans reproduce where great. Although, in the second half of the movie, things become more serious. Sir dies, Little miss dies, and all the other members of the Martin  family. Some people says that they don't like that part very much, but it didn't bother me. Many sad scenes in the movie were very well acted. The only thing that sometimes bothered me was how everyone got so old. The make up effects were good, but they were used too much at times.

While the movie is new, the storyline is a bit old, for it not only brings forth images of Planet of the Apes, but also those from old TV shows as Hazel, The Jeffersons and the Brady Bunch. Now this isn't all that bad, it's just a bit repetitive. What it also does is bring a bit of the Terminator and 21st century reality into the picture. We are reading more and more about computers that can learn from their mistakes or robots that can perform simple tasks now. If you can imagine both the thinking computer and the robot being combined in the near future, then you have the Bicentennial Man. While Robin Williams presents the story in a very warm and touching manner (similar to his role in Mrs. Doubtfire), you can't help but think about reality. I can't help but think of all the different animal rights groups that are around, protecting this species and that, protesting wearing of fur or eating of meat, keeping our tuna free of Flipper, and making sure that no animal was harmed in the making of a movie...are we eventually going to see Robot Rights groups making sure they too were not harmed or scratched in the filming of a movie?

As you can probably deduce from the title this covers about 200 years.  And it doesn't really jump around a whole lot, it covers it all fairly thoroughly.  There are instances where the Robin Williams' character learns about the facts of life, and appropriate ways to swear.  For these reasons some may not want smaller children in the theater.  But it is no worse (probably less so) than prime time TV.

The three basic laws of robotics are stated early and set the stage for a non-threatening science fiction story where the robot is not a danger to the humans.  Then the emotional drama enfolds.Bring handkerchiefs as Robin Williams evolves from a household appliance to reaching as far as he can.  Williams' timing is excellent as he springs off one-liners when Andrew learns about humour and other aspects of the human condition.You don't need a background in Asimov's robot history.  But if you have followed them thoroughly from the short stories to the novels, you will appreciate this adaptation all the more.

The movie was so real in that the 'future' was not portrayed as a gloomy place and since we all have just passed the mythological futuristic aspects of the year 2000, as well as its doom hype, this movie starting in 2005 and progressing on to 2205 in a naturalistic setting seems very possible. Partially based on corporate campus in a normal weather setting you could easily substitute Microsoft or Xerox as the well financed corporation. At home things like furniture appears as we now have and as it will seem to be for some time. Also people are not portrayed in all types of chimaric forms as in Star-Trek.

Isaac Asimov was in many ways the 'father of modern robotics' with his many stories set in a rational world where mechanical beings were bound by a moral code - the Three Laws.  Freed from the dystopian madness depicted by some, his creations became more than mere machines.It is this growth and humanization that the film depicts so well along a 200-year sweep of time.Following the life of NDR-114, a common household appliance robot which (or who) soon proves to possess an uncommon ability to surpass his original programming and develops the ability to feel emotions, this film portrays Andrew's journey and his effect on the people around him.  The family he serves grows old and dies, the world changes seemingly in an eyeblink of his nearly immortal existence.  He strives to become human in body, not knowing he had already achieved humanity in spirit.This is not a smash-bam kind of Science Fiction movie, it is a thinking person's one; those who expected flashing lasers and fantastic spaceships are well advised to seek other entertainment.  However for viewers interested in watching a story of personal achievement set against the backdrop of two centuries of technological growth, the Bicentennial Man is for you.Robin Williams plays Andrew, a modern-day Tin Man in search of a human heart.  Sam Neill is his owner and mentor, and Embeth Davidtz plays the role of two women who have the greatest effect on him.  The remainder of the supporting cast is especially strong.I very much recommend this picture to anyone interested in serious SF and the writings of Asimov.

It's meant to be heartwarming, thought-provoking and sentimental.I suspect that I would have hated it if I expected a comedy, or if I'd brought a gaggle of kids with me.  It's not designed to be viewed on multiple levels.  Despite the totally inappropriate advertising which leads people to think that it's a bit of mind candy for young and old, Bicentennial Man touches on a great deal of issues relating to humans, our values and our expectations of the future and each other.I agree with many of the reviewers that this has all been done before, but rarely with such warmth and care.  Robin chooses his scripts based on the message imparted and the pleasure he would gain in bringing a story to the big screen - and it shows!  I think that the acting and realisation of this movie are incredible and that all involved should be extremely proud of the end result.Having said this, I understand why some people are having problems with the movie.  It's a sci-fi without any emphasis on sci-fi and a human story where the main character is not in fact human.  So, you've lost the sci-fi nuts and those who avoid sci-fi like the plague.  Maybe the blanket marketing is aimed at getting people in the cinema to discover that the future will still be based on real people and that a robot can have a heart.All in all, I really enjoyed the movie - funny how the story of a robot can make you feel more human than ever.

Chris Columbus who made the wonderful Stepmom does some good work, but he can't hide a terrible mess that doesn't know what it wants to do - be a comedy, drama, romance??Besides Williams doing his typical routine performance, did he just photocopy his performance from Jack, Father's Day, Patch Addams? the rest of the cast while promising fails to deliver.

Seeing the trailer for Bicentennial Man almost convinced me not to go near the picture to save my life. However my husband dragged me, kicking and screaming, to see it, and I am happy to say my prejudices in this case were completely wrong. Bicentennial Man has a lot of prejudices to overcome, rather like its self-deprecating hero. Firstly, it stars Robin Williams, whose ventures into sentiment and romance have been a bit questionable at times. Secondly the theme is probably one of the most overworked clichés of modern science fiction &#150; the android who wants to be human. And thirdly, it has to encompass a 200-year time span. All of these problems are handled with surprising competence as Chris Columbus delivers a sympathetic and sensitive film which manages to translate well to the nineties, despite the fact that Asimov's original story harks back to 1976, and has been visited many times by the likes of Gene Roddenberry. The script is a nice blend of humour and pathos without the sickly sentimentality you might expect of this Disney venture. The future world in which the characters live is only touched upon - and rightly so, the emphasis is always on the characters, not the setting.Williams is very good, and Chris Columbus should be congratulated for his direction of him &#150; Andrew is complex and believable and elicits the right amount of sympathy without being overdrawn. Sam Neill is terrific as Sir, a kind and generous master to a point - with some deep-seated prejudices he does not himself understand. All the other characters are nicely balanced against each other and the story paces itself pretty well overall, despite a few flags here and there. The ending raises some interesting moral issues but doesn't preach too hard.The best achievement is the makeup. It is quite simply the best ageing makeup I've ever seen in a modern film. And not a cgi plate in sight here - all prosthetics. Great stuff. Overall a good movie to see if you are a fan of Isaac Asimov, Robin Williams, or just want a couple of hours of good entertainment with enough to chew over later on without getting too weighed down. Footnote to parents don't take the kids. You'll enjoy it much better without them.I think ol' Isaac would have approved.

Sure, the initial scenes were good with much of Williams' trademark humour, but this eventually collapses into that intolerably frequent sentimentality that Williams all too often has indulged in in recent years.Of course, Spiner has had the opportunity to spread this story out for a period of 9 years in various episodes, culminating in Star Trek First Contact.  Bicentennial Man, on the other hand, must complete its tale in less than 2 and a half hours.  That seems to be too much, especially for trodden ground like this.  Perhaps, it is a testament to the success of ST's treatment that it is hard to find other professional reviewers that have done this comparison.  A friend conjectured that the reason, is that viewers of ST have come to identify Data as a character that the fact he is a machine is viewed only as a relatively incidental quirk. If Bicentennial Man could have achieved this, then perhaps this film could have been something better than it is.

Asimov was ground breaking, portraying the human side of robots, especially in his popular I, Robot series.While this treatment of robots is now commonplace in popular fiction (Data in Star Trek, etc), humanity was Asimovs great accomplishment.Bicentennial is a great potrayal of a human robot, and who better than the wonderfully talented actor Robin Williams, who can act in many outlandish and difficult parts with dignity (and humour). Williams' performance in this film is moving, graceful, and in some places humorous - Williams' quirky nature shines in the role of the confused robot Andrew Martin.By placing Williams in a robot suit rather than use computer imagery, the character is real and believable, and the human characteristics of Andrew Martin are definitely there.Sam Neil as Sir is the father figure of Andrew, and acts in his usual stylish manner.Embeth Davidtz is lovely as Portia, the great granddaughter of Sir, and a caring person - undoubtably confused about the intrusion of a robot into her life.The special effects in this film are great, but don't go looking for them. This is not a film about special effects, they are incidental to the plot, merely supporting the premise of a futuristic robot, and the passage of time. The future city of San Fransisco is not as remarkably different from todays, and by keeping the environment familiar to viewers, the director has allowed the viewer to accept the premise, rather than be caught up in it (cf Jurassic Park).So, for a wonderful treatment of human-like robots, from the Master of Science Fiction, Isaac Asimov, be sure to watch this Robin Williams - soon - to - be - classic.

If you love tearjerker, manipulative, syrup-saturated movies, you'll probably like BM. That's not saying it's bad, I liked it because it touched on some very deep issues that just went over some critic's head... Based on Isaac Asimov's short story, Robin Williams plays a robot named Andrew in the near future who manages to become very different. He grows human-like personality, he tries to find out what a joke is and why something is funny, he learns to make wooden carvings, but yet most of the people around him are more robotic then him, with the exception of some of the members of his loving family. And he soon learns the pain of being immortal. The issue of people judging others by their differences, growing old and dying, mixed marriages, even slavery is felt in this movie. Williams does a fine job as our lead character, as does Sam Neill and Embeth Davidtz. But the movie does drag on a bit longer then it should have, so some younger viewers got bored. (and so did some older viewers) Since it's aimed as a family film, it's 131 minutes could have had a half hour trimming. And although there is your usual Robin Williams humor, the movie is not really a comedy.

It never fully challenges his comic timing but does accent upon his growth as an actor.

Bicentennial Man by far isn't one of his best but will remain as one that allowed Columbus and Williams to push the envelope and enhance their talents.  This is director Chris Columbus' first time doing science fiction, his other well known films have been `Mrs Doubtfire' and last year's `Stepmom'. It's an interesting departure for him since he is being rumored to direct `Spiderman' for Sony. His powerful family values and heartwarming moments are evident throughout this film. The century unfolding, the beautiful sets and the special effects are all eye-candy for the holiday crowds. It's been a while since we had a tame family science fiction film. The story, originally conceived by Issac Asimov from his novel, `The Positronic Man', is a tale that has been discussed and overdone a thousand times in science fiction. I wonder that with the birth of this latest retelling that maybe science fiction fans are bored with another dose.

Bicentennial Man was a political allegory about race and slavery and defining human--it was maybe what Asimov called a social science fiction story, definitely a story qualifying as Asimov's social fiction.	The story was pretty bad as an allegory, featuring a robot, Andrew, with what's been called a Pinocchio Complex or Spam (metal on the outside, meat on the inside).  More relevantly for the film, like THE WIZARD OF OZ's Tin Man or _Star Trek Next Generation_'s Mr. Data, Andrew wants to become human and be recognized as human; and he is willing to die to achieve his goal.  	Human chuzhpah!  It's arrogant to assume that intelligent machines would want to become organic so they can be like The Crown of Creation (Fanfare for the Common Man for background, please) us.	In terms of the racial allegory, The Bicentennial Man was and is worse, with the message that Blacks should strive for assimilation, getting their humanity accepted when they became basically White (Spam/Robots Oreo/Blacks). 	The Bicentennial Man was a wrong-headed story, but it was a serious story, and an interesting story.  The film, THE BICENTENNIAL MAN, removes the allegories of slavery and race, leaving us with a love story between Andrew and a human woman and the story's subsidiary point that if All men are mortal and Andrew wants to become a man, Andrew must take on human mortality.  Love stories are nice and mortality as essential to humanity is philosophically interesting, but in BICENTENNIAL MAN there's little development, no conflict, and not much plot or action.	I was rather offended by Asimov's Bicentennial Man; by the film I was mostly bored.

I am still waiting for someone to make Harlan Ellison's screenplay for I, Robot into what would be a superb film if the trolls of Hollywood don't decide to wreck it in the process...but I digress.While I haven't had a chance to read the full length novelization by Asimov and Robert Silverberg of the original short story, it is one of my favorites.  The film credits both versions of the story as source material. I mention this because, I feel that for all but the last half-hour of the film, it follows the source material quite well, and I didn't find the departures overly irritating.  The change that did make me cringe is a gratuitous love affair that served no purpose other than cheap sentimentality.  I also found it irritating because the robot's struggle of achieving official recognition of his humanity is omitted except for a couple of brief court room sequences in favor of this superfluous sub-plot. Perhaps this love affair is in the novelization, but it doesn't seem to me like Asimov's style.Still...I enjoyed the film.  Robin Williams turns in a fine performance, and Sam Neil is especially good as the robot's  original owner.  The sequences in which Neil tries to describe the concept of humor to Williams are quite good, and it seems to me that Asimov's essay on robots and humor should also have been credited, but I suppose that is a minor matter.It isn't the greatest film I've ever seen, but it's better that a hot stick in the eyeball.

It is the most human and most touching rendition of a sci-fi piece I've ever seen.  The original Positronic Man by Asimov stands on its own as a jewel of science fiction, but when combined with Chris Columbus' directing and Robin Williams' acting it comes together.  Maybe I liked it because I'm into science fiction and it's always been sort of a dry and cold genre, or maybe because of my thoughts on love and humanity.  Any way, I rated this a 10. I've never cried at the end of a movie, let alone that much.  Every character is well-played and essential to building the feeling, and the musical score is excellent.

Two thumbs up for Chris Columbus.  Basically, this is a film about freedom.  Andrew Martin (the robot), realizes he is different from a normal machine and then longs for nothing else than to be considered human.  Much like 18th-mid19th century America, where the slaves were treated as something inhuman, so Andrew is, and longs to be considered a human (through a Gandhi method of being accepted as one).  Isaac Asimov did a wonderful job of bringing the human soul into the future, and I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh, or a story of freedom and love.

I felt that Robin Williams did a wonderful job of creating a character that was not quite human.  I think that the make-up was wonderful, and will most likely be nominated for an Oscar.  The way the characters age throughout the movie made you wonder if this hadn't been filmed over a period of decades.There are, however, a few things about Bicentennial Man that didn't quite sit right with me.  First off, I feel that the story didn't spend enough time developing the relationships between the characters.  A couple of the supporting characters were introduced and then quickly dismissed.  Perhaps this was on purpose - if a robot is around for 200 years, not everyone it comes in contact with will have a significant role.Beyond the development of the characters, I thing Bicentennial Man lacked a spark or warmth.  Through out the movie I kept thinking to myself that something was missing.  If you have any ideas on what that something was, please let me know.Also, I would like to warn parents that there are a few things in this movie that are a bit risqué.  And in spite of what the previews may have made you think, this movie is not for kids.  Most children under 13-14 would probably be board with this movie.

I'm not a big fan of Mr. Columbus' works or style, but it works fairly well.  I was mildly disappointed at his need to introduce a binary emotion capability in the human characters.

However, I saw the trailer for the first time just today, and the trailer does not give the movie much justice. What seems like another silly Robin Williams comedy is really more of a discourse on the strength and persistence of a human spirit -- with the subject in question not even being human.With very good taste, the film shows the main character mature and realize his own destiny in life. Attention was paid both to showing details which could give us insight into the reasons the main character is the way he is; at the same time, the film skipped over parts that could potentially have been somewhat boring and arguably unnecessary. Actors -- both Robin Williams and the supporting cast -- performed very well and gave the film a feeling of reality. And while humor naturally plays a critical role in most Robin Williams' films, in Bicentennial Man nothing is overdone or pushed too far.My first problem with the movie was that not much was shown in terms of the society's acceptance of Andrew Martin's uniqueness. The second problem is actually that at around the last half an hour, the movie started getting somewhat too emotional -- forcing the audience feel for the main character. I am too fond of forced emotions for on-screen characters; of course, others' opinions might differ.All-in-all, I highly recommend seeing what is arguably the most calm science fiction film in a while. Instead of throwing special effects and explosions in our faces, the director decided to pay more attention to characters, the plot, and the point of the film. Bicentennial Man is not the best movie I have seen. But it is in my opinion one of the best science fiction films.Don't miss out - the combination of Isaac Asimov's plot with Chris Columbus's directing and Robin Williams's acting created a truly enjoyable, thoughtful film that shows that it is possible to do sci-fi without gore and terror.

Well, but everyone is entitled to an opinion, to have their own tastes...but, criticize, that, I think, needs fair and reasonable arguments, at least...Bicentennial Man is not a movie about a robot, it's not a sci-fi movie.

Soon Andrew becomes part of the family and develops a own personality. But he wants more, he wants freedom and feelings. Around him time goes by, people grow up, grow old and eventually die. This start out to be the final quest and conflict for Andrew, why have feelings when everyone vanishes?Comments A very sweet movie. Actually a very sweet, warm and a little funny movie with quite some emotion and feeling. At least the second half is. The problem is that it takes very long until it really gets interesting. The entire first half feels like a very long introduction. It's too predictable and full of clichés. A robot working in a close and understanding family. What do you think will happen? I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, as it didn't seem to have any ambition or promise to show any potential. Quite unlike Andrew that is.And that would have been too bad. Because the second half is quite different. As mentioned above it is very warm. Sweet and quite full off emotion. It's a bit ironic, and not so little weird, that it doesn't happen until Andrew's second try. He couldn't connect with Little Miss but then succeeds with her look alike granddaughter. But if you manage to forget that idea, it is actually quite charming. It is ironic that what I felt like a little weird is actually one of the main issues Andrew fights with. His immortality and inhumanity.Well, all in all, it's a good movie. Robin Williams is good as the developing robot.

It was OK, but somehow the characters and the emotions never felt real to me. Well, what I didn't find in A.I., I did find in this one. In my opinion it was far more heart-warming and 'realistic' than Spielberg's movie ever was. And even though it may all look a bit superficial at first sight, I still find it a very nice movie to watch.Robin Williams plays the role of an android robot who has only one wish to become a real human being. At first he is just an ordinary household robot, purchased by the Martin family, to perform normal household tasks. But soon the family finds out that their robot isn't like it should be. It has the capability to learn new things, to think of its own and to be creative... Gradually he is accepted by the family as one of their own and they stimulate him to become better and better. In the 200 years of his lifetime, while he has to keep fighting for his right to exist because the people who first created him now want to destroy him, he'll gradually become a real human.Although I have to admit that the first part is far from original and many scenes already seem to be done a million times in other movies, this movie gradually grows on you. And as I already said this movie is really heart-warming. This is not so much a film about robots or sci-fi (which could be very cold and hard to watch), but a film about life, humanity, relationships, love and family.

But 'Andrew' is no ordinary robot, which robs us of that ultimate question.  It's sort of Short Circuit's Number 5 with legs instead of wheels.  Gone is the real question of what is really life, what is really mind, and gone is the real question of rights and prejudices.  The other robot in the story appears 'aware' because the personality circuits are turned on while 'Andrew' (we are assured) has his turned off.  But were they?  Or was there a bug in the system which resulted in them being activated - e.g. when he launched himself out of the window.Oh, and only when he looked really human are we really allowed to think that he has a 'soul' and is worthy of true freedom - the right to die.

I felt the need to say that before going any farther, because the first bit of what I have to say will sound critical. Anyone who has ever watched more than a handful of episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation will recognize the robot Andrew (played very well by Robin Williams) as Data - the artificial life form whose entire existence seems dedicated to becoming more and more human. Much of what happens to Andrew parallels events of Data's life in episodes of STTNG. In other words, this movie is entirely and wholly unoriginal. It also suffers from being completely predictable. It's clear from the very beginning where this movie is going, and there's no real surprise at the end. The second half is much weaker than the first, due largely to the introduction of Oliver Platt as the scientist Rupert Burns, who helps Andrew in his quest to become more human, and Kiersten Warren as the incredibly irritating robot Galatea. The part of Galatea was obviously introduced by script writers who thought it necessary to add a completely unnecessary and foolish character, while Burns - whose role as the scientist was necessary - should (in my opinion) have been played as a far more serious scientist than how Platt portrayed him. I was also left scratching my head at why Richard Martin (Sam Neill) was so absolutely opposed to giving Andrew his freedom. True, he eventually acknowledges that he was wrong, but Richard more than anyone should have been sympathetic to Andrew's desire, and his opposition is never really explored or explained. It's simply fluffed off in a death bed repentance.Ok. There's the problems. And having said it, I also want to add that this was really a very enjoyable movie. If it was unoriginal, it was still a moving story of emotional exploration and growth, and offers a thought-provoking look at exactly what it is that makes any of us truly human. Williams was excellent, and Embeth Davidtz, in the dual role of Amanda (Little Miss) and her grand-daughter Portia was equally good. In fact, here was the part of the movie that was most intriguing the opportunity to see Andrew interact with four generations of Martins (not all of whom cared for him.) The fight of Andrew to be recognized as human is a reminder of how many have had to fight over the years for such recognition (blacks, women, etc.), and so there is an interesting piece of historical and social commentary going on here as well.So, I may have written more negative than positive here, but that doesn't at all reflect my thinking after having seen the movie. I enjoyed it, and I'd even watch it again. I'd rate it as a 7/10.

Is there any other movie lover out there (and I'm not hard to please; I like almost everything) that agrees this is the worst movie of all time?Considering everything -- the stars involved, high production value ($100 million budget), lavish presentation, and excruciating result, Chris Columbus' meretricious movie is more spectacular in disaster than any cheapo B-movie.  The shameless sentimentality is mawkish to an extreme, and it fails to inspire or move us.  In goes right for our heartstrings, trying to manipulate them like a puppeteer, but it fumbles them badly because it hasn't earned an emotional connection with our feelings.  The film is flat. Robin Williams can make some good films, but boy can he make some bad ones (also notable being the abominable Patch Adams).  Who could have thought that the makers of the resoundingly funny Mrs. Doubtfire could misfire so badly here?Is there anyone else out there who also finds it disturbing that a human woman is having sex with a robot?  Does that send a flutter of creeped-out revulsion through anyone else?  I seriously doubt beautiful Embeth Davidtz (so poignant and exuding so much pathos in Schindler's List) would start having intercourse with a metal robot, metal shaft and all, computer chips firing during the act, busting a gasket literally?  I'm all for suspension of disbelief, but I would think this would not be an appealing notion for female viewers.This is the only movie that I can say turned my stomach almost from the start, then inexorably turned the screw, engendering a slow and sickening torture that left me nearly dead by the end of it.  I was actually green in the face when we left.

Andrew (Williams) begins as a robot purchased by `Sir' played by Sam Neil who quickly becomes part of the family.  During the next few years, Andrew develops the ability to not only create and recreate, but also possess intelligence.

Given a robot's longevity, what human ideal could be striven after in a way which human mortality and decay currently make impossible? Why, falling in love and having decades of great sex, that's what! The spirit which turned HEIDI into a police chase in 1937 is still alive and well. The orgasm may be the current godlet of choice in North America (especially Southern California), but Asimov's (and humanity's) vision is not quite so narrow. To be fair, the film does show, if obliquely, some of the tireless agape-style love which the First Law of Robotics implies. Asimov's Three Laws (see the Trivia section) are introduced in the first few minutes, as is right and proper, but they are never exploited as cunningly or as consistently as Asimov employed them. (SPOILER) For example, a very old Portia orders the robot Galatea to unplug her from life support after Andrew dies. She acquiesces promptly, without any argument or resistance, in complete defiance of the First Law (A robot may not harm a human being.). The scene could have been played, to great emotional effect, with Portia explaining that not permitting her to die, with Andrew gone, would in fact be allowing her to come to harm. And then there's the robot-as-nigger-of-the-world theme. By the Second Law, a robot must obey the command of any human. During Andrew's long odyssey to discover his own kind, did he never run into any humans who took advantage of his obedient robot nature? As the late Dr. Asimov himself said in the original Bicentennial Man story collection in 1976, I don't like to get tangled up with the visual media directly. They've got money, but that's all they've got. This film, unfortunately, opts for lightness and superficiality when it could be so much more profound. And it's a shame we don't get to see anyone impersonate the redoubtable Dr. Susan Calvin of U.S. Robotics. Nevertheless, the film's surface is admittedly gorgeous. Seeing how the future develops, the aircars and futuristic cityscapes, is a blast. The performances are good, especially Sam Neill as Sir and Oliver Platt as the lugubrious robotics genius whom Andrew finances and partners.

It overreaches its capabilities and can't seem to pull it all together.  It seems that the more human Andrew became, the worse the film got.This is based on Isaac Asimov's short story about a robot named Andrew (Robin Williams) whose flawed programming makes him obsessed with becoming human.  It shows his relationship with four generations of the Martin family and his various upgrades toward humanhood.  The first part of the film is engaging and droll.  Williams is at his best when he is doing offbeat comedy, and this segment had a warm kind of comedy that was enchanting.By the time the film progressed to the romance between Andrew and Portia, it had used up its charm.  It became contrived and implausible.  Williams is beyond his talents as a romantic lead and all the romantic scenes were forced and awkward.  As the film moved towards the ending, Andrew wasn't the only thing getting moribund.  The entire film began to decay.Director Chris Columbus did some excellent work in the area of makeup.  The robot costumes and the aging makeup was wonderfully done.  Unfortunately, much was lacking in the costumes and sets as the decades went by.  As time passed, nothing seemed to change as regards dress and sets.  We are led to believe that 200 years hence, everything will look pretty much the way it looks today.  Think of the difference between dress in 1800 and today.  Shouldn't we expect changes of similar magnitude over the next 200 years?  Apparently not in Columbus' mind.  The only indications that it wasn't the 20th century were a couple of futuristic blue screen city backdrops and that's about it.  Very unimaginative.Sam Neill was marvelous as the Martin patriarch.  He gave the father wisdom, character and a strong guiding hand.  Embeth Davidtz was lovely but a little tentative at times as Portia.  She was stronger as Little Miss, which required more warmth than dynamism.  Williams was very good at the start, but as the water got deeper, he floundered.  He needs to stay with wacky comedy roles and stop pretending he is a dramatic/romantic lead.

One thinks that beautiful actresses (Embeth Davidtz, Monica Potter from Patch Adams) and talented actors (Oliver Platt, and Philip Seymour Hoffman from Patch) will have to start a support group for those whose careers have had to suffer through a Robin Williams How I am a better Human than You type movie. One could not understand why Sir (Sam Neill's character) would think the audience is so dumb that he would have to say to Andrew Martin (Robin Williams) You stopped referring to yourself as One when the constant referral of one's self as One was extremely irritating to this viewer (er...one). It's like pointing out that someone has finally stopped dragging their fingernails across a chalkboard for 40 minutes.  One would notice that one's self, Sir.  One is grateful that Hallie Kate Eisenberg was in this for a relatively short time.  One thinks that is the only good decision Chris Columbus made regarding this movie.  One found the humor completely lame and it seems that the actors (besides Williams) did too b/c their laughter was extremely fake.  One thought that the female robot dancing to A Little Respect by Aretha Franklin was the most horrifyingly awful 15 seconds of cinema ever produced.  One found the characters to be one-dimensional, especially those who hate the android for no reason other than the trite script requires them to hate Andrew.  One especially did not like Andrew, b/c he falls in love with someone only because they look exactly like her grandmother who he was in love with.  Also b/c he insults a rival for his love based on physical appearance, and not the rival's character.One considers this movie to be cinematic wallpaper.  A completely flat, monotonous dreadful movie that should only be seen if it is playing in the background of another, better movie.Finally, yes you guessed it, One gives this movie a 1 out of 10.

His wife (Wendy Crewson) isn't so sure. His daughter Grace tells the younger sister Amanda that it's an android. Amanda can't quite say the word Android and instead says Andrew. From then on, the robot is named Andrew (Robin Williams). Grace commands Andrew to jump out of the window and Richard tells the children to treat Andrew as a person from then on. Richard notices signs of individual creativity in Andrew and brings it back to the company. Dennis Mansky (Stephen Root) wants to disassembles Andrew but Richard refuses. The Martins go on a lifelong journey to nurture Andrew's individuality as he/it becomes more human. Adult Amanda (Embeth Davidtz) pushes to treat Andrew as a person and even granting him his freedom. Andrew discovers inventor Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt) who's father was the original designer.There are some bad attempts at humor. There are also some better ones. There is a knock-knock sequence that is reminiscent of Abbott and Costello. However that is more of an exception in this movie. Mostly the movie feels overly sentimental and cheesy. It simply lacks tension and drama for the most part. Isaac Asimov stories don't usually have the cinematic feel. They are more about ideas than a thrill ride. This movie attempts to make an Asimov story that spans two centuries into a compelling drama. It is probably too high of a hurdle. Quite frankly, I don't think Chris Columbus has the edge to do it or the artistry to make it unique. I keep thinking that there are more compelling stories in the 200 years but Columbus could never find them. It becomes a rather flat telling of a story that has an intriguing big-time concept at its core.

The first part..as in Ai.. the family bit.. was very humorous, the music helped set the mood and the acting did the rest. It tugs heartstrings. For Andrew to be 'free' he has to leave the family circle. I didn't quite understand that but he had to 'find' himself.. I guess so. Yes, the 'Data' complex about having logic but not feelings or being human. Better to have loved, well, if one enjoys being torn apart when a relationship doesn't work.. having a feeling of contentment and then knowing its time to go, thats a different matter.

In the recent movies, the trend towards humanizing them, with all flaws has become the in-thing. Bicentennial man is one such emotional flick.In a futuristic world, 2005 according to the movie, a humanoid robot NDR-114 enters the Martin house to a family of four. He is soon called ‘Andrew’. Originally designed to perform household tasks, Andrew displays extraordinary creativity designing objects from wood, something he wasn’t designed for and soon builds a fortune that way. Time passes, children grow, younger ‘little miss’ gets married, has kids.Andrew has read human history and wishes to seek freedom and thus parts ways with his owner ‘Sir’ Martin. He only returns to him when the latter is on his deathbed. Andrew continues his friendship with ‘Little Miss’ and with the support of her son, he goes ahead finding other NDRs to see if any of them were like him. This takes him to the laboratory of Rupert Barnes who is into advanced research to make Robots more human.A rich Andrew then funds Burns, obtains a human appearance, a la Robin Williams and returns to little miss. So much time has passed that he now encounters her young granddaughter Portia who resembles little miss. Time passes and he soon befriends Portia and falls in love with her. This time, with Burns’ help, he obtains a central nervous system, becomes more human and seeks to marry Portia.However, the wedding faces opposition since he is not declared human. With Portia at 75 and Andrew not willing to leave her, he injects blood into his system allowing his body to deteriorate, so that he can die human. In the end, both Andrew and Portia are on their deathbeds, way past their hundreds when the World Council acknowledges his humanness, he dies. By then, Andrew had spent 200 active years, thus bicentennial.A little more than two hours, the film seems to drag on since we see generations die, in fact four generations of Martins. Nevertheless, the special effects are well made and Robin Williams is really convincing as the Robot wanting to become human. Embeth Davidtz is very sweet as Little Miss & Portia. In the movie, I liked best the concept of creating artificial organs! How revolutionary if we could replace everything!

Overall this effort to put his work on film falls short & is uneven at best. The make up & sets are very impressive but director Chris Columbus work is uneven.Robin Williams does the best he can with a silver suit handicapping him a fair part of the film & then establishing his human condition slowing him down the rest of it. His acting is OK, but since the script, even though dumbed down from Assimov's writing, does not have much crisp dialog he really can't shine too well.The supporting cast Embeth Davidtz, Sam Neil & Oilver Platt do a pretty fair job. There is one comic blackout sequence that is pretty funny involving a female robot in the lab singing Harold Arlens If I only Had A Heart that is classic. Thr trouble with this is that considering Issac Asimov died before it was made & it only slightly resembles his work, the film would have been much better if they had lightened it up & put in more comedy. The film very much looks like they put in just enough comedy for the previews which seems to happen in too many of Robins Williams films.Overall, the ending is a necessary downer as Asimov's work often is, but because of this & the fact the script doesn't really get the viewer involved enough to get out too many hankies, it makes it seem very flat at the end. This is half a good film that really could have been much better if the film only had a heart as that is what is missing here.

A robot that wants to be a man, we have seen some nice tries for that one... However, I was happily surprised how cleverly the whole thing was built up from step to step. Of course you cannot completely forget that it is a tale, but I almost did! I never felt the steps of the robot on the ladder of becoming a man too sudden. Always baby steps, therefore the whole thing became more or less believable.The other important thing that this movie has tons of LOVE. Not love between man and woman. Love between persons. It is very rare, I think. Films introduce love in the form of some kind of passion, and all the emotions are built upon that passion. I don't say that's bad, but I doubt that love is all about that. It was a relief to see a movie where love between man and woman is also based upon something else friendship. Beautiful! And this friendship filled every second of the movie. It gave a very warm atmosphere around the basic story of the robot becoming a man.Some say that every movie has to have at least one bad guy, otherwise it is boring. I totally disagree with that. It it so good to find a movie where every main character is good. This is one of those movies.Finally, the ending is positive. I feel it important to mention because in my opinion it is really hard to make a movie beautiful AND with happy ending in the same time. That's why most of the beautiful stories end sadly. This one doesn't. Congratulations to the director!

I say his Razzie Award nomination was justified. He gives a half good and a half bad performance. The rest of the cast fit well into their roles, and give good performances. The movie can become very slow at times, and make you want to fall asleep, but there are the excellent special effects that holds your attention. The makeup design is excellent for the aging of Williams character and everybody else. James Honor has once again given us a great movie score to fall in love with.

In the literary version, Andrew's wish to become human is not linked to emotional attachment. That was Columbus' add-on. They probably thought Mmmmkay, now how would the audience really get the message that Andrew wants to be human, WITHOUT having to think too much? It seems that unless you create a romantic interest nowadays, the Hollywood moguls will think that their products will not raise interest from the masses. That will probably explain, also, movies like the 2001 remake of The Count of Monte-Cristo, which similarly ravage a literary gem, reducing it to a mere triangle, and putting love above all. Or why did the filmmakers ask the terribly corny Celine Dion to sing over the Bicentennial Man's credits, in a rip-off of the Titanic theme...The short story could've even made for a great legal thriller - in a sense, most of Andrew's existence is spent in courts, winning little by little the acknowledgment that he is a person. The sad part is that some of us will probably live to see such trials for good, in a few decades, and rather than pay hommage to Asimov's clairvoyance, we will have some hazy impressions of a soapy film.The implications were also fascinating. Asimov sees Andrew as backed up by a corporation If a man had died, the firm of Feingold and Martin lived, for a corporation does not die any more than a robot does. The firm had its directions and it followed them soullessly. By way of the trust and through the law firm, Andrew continued to be wealthy. His metamorphoses are gradual, and occur much slower than in the film - and they are not taking place in a makeshift lab, led by some maniacal, anti-social geek - another romantic cliche too dear to Hollywood, which simply cannot comprehend the idea that the Frankenstein image is dated...Here's another sample from Asimov's work Andrew says I have the shape of a human being and organs equivalent to those of a human being. My organs, in fact, are identical to some of those in a prosthetized human being. I have contributed artistically, literally, and scientifically to human culture as much as any human being now alive. What more can one ask? So, instead of spending his eternity courting a girl and making jealous scenes (like in the movie), Andrew actively makes the world a better place, acting in not just one (prosthetics), but several directions. Wow! Now, why wasn't that photogenic enough for Columbus and Co. ?Here's another example In the story, Andrew's lawyer tells him We've done two things, Andrew, both of which are good. First of all, we have established the fact that no number of artificial parts in the human body causes it to cease being a human body. Secondly, we have engaged public opinion in the question in such a way as to put it fiercely on the side of a broad interpretation of humanity, since there is not a human being in existence who does not hope for prosthetics if they will keep him alive. Now, these are issues that are becoming as important and striking as humanity itself. Some of those who still read books will remember that the French writer Vercors raised the same issues regarding the definition of humanity in one of his novels, Les animales denatures. These are truly important themes that need to be discussed much more than they are...Last but not least, the film embodies another Hollywood cliche, which I want to criticize harshly. Why is it that so many movies lately (meaning in the past 20 years), have been pedalling on the idea that death is inevitable, that it has to be embraced, that it is the order of things, and so on? The best - and ludicrous - example was the case of Cocoon 2 The Return, in which we were treated to similar ideas, but which simply demolished the original film and its characters. Why do filmmakers need to pound us over the head with the idea that even 200 years into the future will people choose to die after living the same 75 years as today? Do they think humans cannot produce and enrich their lives - and those of others -  while enjoying a longer span? Not to mention that, in this particular case, THIS BLATANTLY CONTRADICTS ASIMOV'S CENTRAL THEME! Andrew Martin helps people live longer so that they can enjoy life and be happy, and he is, in a sense, sacrificing himself, refusing to follow the same destiny which he brilliantly offered others, but dying happy, knowing that he was officially recognized as a man - while the film steals even this from him.These, and other shortcomings, make Bicentennial Man a cute movie, but one that is as forgettable as an episode of Friends. I wonder if Asimov would have approved of it. This film could have been a second Blade Runner, not your average silly Comedy/Romance...  I guess those are choices that were made for us, by the men who tell us, through their on-screen characters, that To be human is to make mistakes. Wonderful, guys, you just brilliantly proved your humanity!Note All the quotes from Mr. Asimov's The Bicenntenial Man are given here strictly for educational purposes, and therefore do not legally constitute a copyright infringement.

It'd be more likely a company or scientist striving for years might hit on intelligence, but enough of that....All the story takes place in a soap bubble.  It's not a question of if our hero becomes human but how long it takes.  There's none of the social upheavals, cultural changes, or disasters that would happen in the two hundred or so years the story covers.  Society simply putters along and Robin replaces all his parts until he's flesh and blood. Similarly, his romantic interest decides she doesn't want to continue because it just doesn't feel right, not because she's lived beyond her family or place in time.  Some serious consideration of the philosophy or meaning of humanity would have helped the story greatly, rather than the robot deciding aging and dying would make him human.Despite this, there are some very touching moments between the robot and his eventual wife, and again Williams's humor.

You're a dead man!","Date":"3 June 2004","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Okay, so if I had to take the PINK tablets then surely the RED tablets are the same only more potent, right? That does make sense to you doesn't it?Firstly, Chris Columbus is a DEAD MAN! That right Chris, you've pushed my buttons once too often, especially after &#145;Mrs Doubtfire' and then &#145;Adventures in Babysitting'. But I digress, so I'll go back to the beginning, which was last Sunday afternoon&#133;I'm watching TV as Richie goes through my mum's stuff for any inflammatory items capable of causing &#145;psychotic resurgence' as he calls it. That's normally stuff like money or jewellery, but he once confiscated my MP3 player and was going to take my PC as well. Luckily without those things Richie says I won't &#145;go freaking nuts' again, and also because of the pink pills he gives me. As usual he's always on the phone, but starts to get all nervous. Something about a yard or some yards, or something and some turf. Anyway he says he's got to go back to the hospital and gives me the last of the pink pills and puts on &#145;Bicentennial Man' for me to watch, telling me not to move.The first thing I notice as Richie leaves is that CHRIS COLUMBUS has made this film. That brings back the bad feelings I used to have, but I'm better now so I don't mind. Then I see that it stars Robin Williams as a robot, which kind of makes me feel strange and I remember a Virgin Airways flight, and something about an emergency landing. But I'm cool, I'm chilled, I'm making progress so these things don't bother me.Then the robot falls out of a window.HELLO? HELLO CHRIS? That's what happened to me at Shelley's house! Well, not exactly what happened, a young girl didn't tell me to jump out of the window an ex Royal Marine punched me through it, but it's just the sort of artistic licence that Columbus takes when transferring my life to film.So obviously I'm getting angry and realise that I've run out of pink tablets because Richie's sold half of them. Luckily he'd left his duffle bag so I quickly search through it but can't find any pink ones. Red, yellow, green, blue, orange, my mum's purse, brown and white, but not pink, although like I said I was getting angry, so logically red. Right?I gulped them down with some of my mum's sherry and began watching the film again. That's when I realised that Chris Columbus had been moving my mum's furniture. Not much, just enough for me to notice. At that moment I had a horrible feeling that the director of &#145;Mrs Doubtfire' was hiding somewhere in my mum's house. Logically I armed myself with a saucepan and went looking for him, just as the robot on TV turned into Robin Williams and started spying on girls at parties. I SPY ON GIRLS AT PARTIES!That made me really, really angry, just as I heard the front door open and guess who staggers in? CHRIS COLUMBUS disguised as a terrified looking Richie. Moments later he looked concussed and collapsed onto the street, where some people (who I think were members of the &#145;So Solid Crew') bundled him into the back of a van. I thought it strange that they had something against Chris Columbus, although maybe he'd been stalking them too, but they said thanks and drove off. To be honest, I was just relieved that I could finally relax having vanquished my Nemesis.The ending of the film was quite good, because the robot had become a man, although if I were a robot I'd want to stay a robot. Obviously I wouldn't want to be a servant robot like Robin Williams was, but like the ABC Warrior in Judge Dredd.`DEREK PALMERS. I AM A ROBOT. YOUR KOALA RELATED DRUG CHARGES DO NOT APPLY TO ME.

The majority of the audience will walk into a Robin Williams film expecting at least a few side-splitting laughs, but instead, with Bicentennial Man we are surprised with an emotional and at some points heart-wrenching story about a human trapped inside a robot and cursed with endless life.

Furthermore, Embeth Davidtz is wooden and two-dimensional and the other characters are too short-lived to be of interest. The film is 20 minutes too long and the direction fails to ignite certain key scenes, the overall effect being of a gentle, un-demanding ramble through 200 years of a robot's life.

I haven't trusted a movie with Robin Williams in it for the last five years, and when I saw he was in Bicentennial Man I immediately thought it would be awful.I was right.The first hour or so of the movie was pure bliss!  Andrew trying to act human and 'Little Miss' (played by the little Pepsi girl *hehe*) was perfect, and I enjoyed Sam Neill (of Jurassic Park and Merlin fame) as Sir.  That was great.  But as time wore on, the movie got worse.  Part of that comes from the fact that it never wants to end; as soon as something begins to resolve itself, you think Ah, it's over soon only to find the movie start a whole next chapter.  It's tedious, boring, and a repeat of what's already happened, just slicked up to make it look different.It FELT like two hundred years had gone by because the movie didn't know when to resolve itself.  It was all climax but no finish.  Also, way, way, WAY too much sex talk, and too explicit.  God, I had to see this with my parents, my little sisters, and my grandmother, so don't let the PG-13 rating fool you.  I was expecting something more appropriate for the whole family, not having to listen to talk about sperm and to see a love scene while my 7 year-old kid sister sits to my left and my grandmother on the right.After a while, you just wish Andrew would stop getting tiny little improvements to became a 'real' human and just do it all at once.  This way, the audience doesn't have to watch two hundred years crammed into two and a half hours (though it feels much MUCH longer).  And I won't give away the ending, knowing how people hate spoilers, but trust me when I say it is SO anti-climax you want to sob, or at least demand your money back.

By following this journey we learn what the storyteller wishes us to know about what it means to be human.The Isaac Asimov novella (and the later novel with Robert Silverberg) is one story among many that are set in a future history during which the development of humanoid robots results in a number of societal and ethical conflicts. The movie, standing alone, all but ignores the wider issues while being faithful, in part, to the original story. Unfortunately, because it ignores the wider issues, the movie ends up being somewhat shallow.The movie opens with the arrival of a domestic robot at the home of the Martin family. Christened Andrew by the youngest daughter, Little Miss, the robot quickly becomes janitor, chef and nanny but not without tension in the family. Andrew, played by Robin Williams in a rather nice metal outfit, appears programmed to resort to imitation in learning human pleasantries and tends to hover annoyingly when not doing anything. While subservient, and apologetic, to its owners, one soon wonders why Andrew wasn't programmed to ask questions like Would Ma'am prefer to serve breakfast herself? instead of getting in the way.Nevertheless, the Martins become used to Andrew and soon discover that he seems to be somewhat different from other domestic robots of his type. He displays a surprising self-motivation, artistic talent and appreciation for music, art and literature. The family realizes that he has the desire and capacity to learn beyond his programming and encourage this. As the years go by, Andrew learns the concept and develops a desire for freedom. His request is met with consternation but is granted and Andrew--Andrew Martin--truly begins his journey to becoming a man.It is at this point that the movie begins to stray from the original story Andrew begins a journey to find other robots of his kind, seeking the companionship of his own kind; he discovers an eccentric genius, who alters his body to become more human in appearance; and, he meets a descendant of the Martins, to whom Andrew becomes close and with whom he learns more of what it means to be human.While the changes may have been more cinematic, I felt they failed to take on the challenge of portraying the consequences of Andrew's goal. Instead of exploring the questions of what it means to be human we are given some predictable emotional scenes--strange, when it is not clear Andrew has emotions. When Andrew makes his desires public, there should be some reaction from the population. We are also introduced to Galatea, another robot similar to Andrew, who takes over the comedic role in the latter half of the movie. Galatea was so irritating and even less competent than the early scenes of Andrew that I was rooting for her to be caught and dismantled during one scene.Because the Asimov story is a favorite of mine, I was apprehensive at a theatrical adaptation. I did like that the world of the future was portrayed with matte shots and few props. More would have distracted us from the story although it would have been nice to see a few other kinds of robots instead of people dressed strangely.I was annoyed that the movie took the time to (loudly) introduce Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, the immutable programming that all robots are governed by, at the beginning of the movie but have the plot and actions of the robots conveniently ignore them to advance the story. It would have been better not to introduce them at all or have changed the script. It became so flagrant that it took away from my enjoyment of the movie.On the other hand, I believe Robin Williams was a good choice to play Andrew. While he is in the metal suit, and later out of it, he is talented enough to control is body language and delivery to make him look and sound believable as Andrew Martin. And while it is funny to watch Robin Williams perform some light comedy and slapstick to liven things up, the movie meanders between that and the so-so drama of Andrew's growth and journey that I felt Williams' talent was wasted.IMDb vote 5  "},{"Title":"I thought it was too long","Date":"24 December 1999","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi","Review":"  First of all, I must say that it was WAY too long.

Rather than have his aberrant programming 'fixed', Andrew's owners encourage him to explore his newfound individuality, which leads him on a journey to seek out others like him and become human.Essentially an updated reworking of Pinocchio, it's William's second film this year (remember the stagnant and monumentally depressing Jakob the Liar?  If not, don't worry, I don't know anyone else who saw it&#133;) and is a rough adaptation of two Isaac Assimov stories.  This combination of solid author and excellent actor should be foolproof.  It isn't.   The studio brass at Warner Brothers were concerned that the most bankable asset of the film (William's face) is covered for more than half the movie.   They had good reason to be.   Although a capable actor (they don't give out Oscars to just anybody), Williams is still best known for his physical comedy.  Trapped behind a mask we don't get to see his expressions and no amount of clever prosthetics or subtle intonations and one-liners will suffice. Finally, the movie is too long. Granted, the story is supposed to cover two centuries, but the pacing is painfully slow.  Halfway through the film you no longer care about Andrew's dilemma  and no amount of eye candy (the futuristic San Franciso landscape mapped over the present one is beautifully done) will make up for it.If you want to see a good treatment of the subject matter, tune into some reruns of Star Trek the Next Generation and watch for the android named Data.

He had a stint of bad movies like Flubber, Father's Day, Jack, etc. Then of course there was the beautiful work of art that is Good Will Hunting and it looked like his career might really pick up again except for a few years later when he put out this movie. Bicentennial Man is a sci-fi drama about an android who is bought by a family in order to serve them in day to day activity, essentially being a household appliance. These androids aren't supposed to be designed with any personality or emotion, but this android, named Andrew by his family, begins to develop these emotions and builds relationships with his entire family, yet always longing for more human qualities so that he may share what everyone around him has. The film chronicles his 200 year long life and it is ridiculously mushy, sappy, and melodramatic at every turn.Bicentennial Man had a lot of potential. It's a movie that could have had a lot of very real heart had it not turned into the mushy melodrama that it is. The premise is very interesting and there are plenty of ways this story could have gone had it been done well. But the filmmakers opted to make this story as cliché, Hollywood, and ridiculous as possible, removing any element of awe or wonder at the saga of this android who only wants to give and receive love. The film doesn't start out bad. It opens with this typical suburban upper middle class family buying Andrew. Andrew's relationships with the family are quickly established and it doesn't take much effort to realize which relationships will go where.It's after you realize how predictable and how dull this film is that it just starts to plummet downhill. Once it starts to get bad it never picks up again. We move further into Andrew's life and then events start to get all jumbled and the whole film develops into one big mess. There is no structure to the film and no pacing. It just sorts of moves along however it feels like, not regarding proper usage of timing and character/plot development. Plus, it never gets very interesting. Everything that happens in this movie is dull. You can even tell which points in the film were supposed to be big deals and you can see where the emotional moments are supposed to go, but they are in actuality missing, only to be replaced with pathetic Hollywood tripe that we've seen a thousand times over. There are certain points in the film where I feel like the writers forgot that Andrew was a robot and the film just feels like another sappy love story, lacking a unique bone in its entire body. Ninety percent of this movie is an absolute drag.Now, Robin Williams is a great actor, but he can't save a movie like this. His performance is nothing special and I would be lying to you if I told you it was any good at all. None of the performances in this film are interesting or memorable. You can blame this on the poorly written characters who are all grotesquely one dimensional and lack any human spirit. I never felt for Andrew and I never really cared to see whether or not he would succeed in becoming human or not. This is also because I knew what the outcome of this film would be from the start simply because I've seen other movies and know how this typical predictability works in the standard Hollywood dribble. Damn, I hate movies like this. They make me sound so cynical.Bicentennial Man is just not a good film. It had some potential, but that potential was dashed against the rocks about twenty minutes into the film when the lack of creativity and originality reared its ugly head. It is always sad to watch a movie where you can pinpoint the exact places that would have been heart wrenching or beautifully powerful had this been a well made film. Bicentennial Man has a depressing amount of these moments and it makes you want to love this movie. But it is just so caked in melodrama and sappy feel good BS that your admiration turns into irritation and downright dislike. There is nothing special about this movie and its hard to think of it as much more than just a waste of two hours.

The other problem is that, as mentioned, the film covers 2 centuries of time; even at 2+ hours, that doesn't leave much leeway for the story to stay very long in each decade. So, you have the inevitable hop-hop pace as the film skitters to the climax. You see a few minutes, for example, of the way things are 30 years from now; then, a couple of minutes around the year 2040, and so on. And on. It does go on, and in not a very thrilling manner for what should be exciting stuff. The director, Chris Columbus, relies on patented schmaltzy observations of shallow depth, with no sense of the complexities of life (there's no time). It also places huge importance on Bi-Man being recognized as a true human being, at the same time designating divine standing on being a human and that this divinity depends on what other people think - a confusing position.

The movie was misrated also !!It should of been rated a PG-13 for foul words, sexual references and others!!I put this movie as one of the worst movies of the year!!I mean even The Green Mile was better than this overhyped junk!!Save yourself your hard earned cash and wait for the video/DVD!!But if you must see , you have been warned by me and the other on this database!!Save your $$$$ for something special you want really bad!!!Avoid,avoid avoid this medicore candy-coated movie!!!!

(If you are not, you should be.) When I was very young, this was the one story of all stories that I wanted to become a movie - and I had it all in my mind. This is utterly not so.Asimov's stories took science fiction in a direction that few other authors could. Robots for him were not simply scientific inventions, but the height of human achievement progressing beyond our current civilization. This movie thus contradicts itself, practically in every scene as well as in the story line.The Robot Andrew Martin (Robin Williams), when introduced in the movie, is shown to have human emotions, but ranking in intelligence below that of a medically certified idiot. Although Andrew's intelligence evolves through the movie, the return every once in a while to slap-stick style comedy (the yes-no-yes-no scene with Little Miss and Portia (Embeth Davidtz), the poke-me-in-the-eye scene) detriments much from the story as well as the character of Andrew. It is hard to believe that after traveling the world, the now 62 year old Andrew would say fecal matter and not know to say a piece of sh*t. Pearls before Swan? Swine Lake? And why, why, why, why, why, why is farting supposed to be funny? This is not that kind of a movie.Asimov, in his mind, was already in the world where robots existed the way he portrayed them. His stories would reflect in many dimensions on how he perceived this world. The Bicentennial Man was perhaps his best canvas for this world, as it takes us through 200 years of the future. The speed of development and progress, not only scientifically but also as mankind, was evident through the story.The movie falls so short of this. The negative portrayal of NorthAm Robotics (a.k.a. U.S. Robots and Mechanical Men to Isaac Asimov) is just one small part of the disappointment. They were not the deceitful organization as the movie makes them to be (or at least the one man shown to represent the entire organization).The attempt to become free, while becoming a legal battle in the book, is a conversation of a few seconds.Andrew's evolving humanity, according to the book, is entirely his with others supporting him in the endeavor. This convinces the reader that Andrew IS human, and the world failing to recognize him makes the reader feel for him. It leaves the reader in wonder that something created by humans COULD be human.The movie shows Andrew's humanity to be a series of ideas placed by others, and therefore not his own. I came away thinking that he didn't really deserve it, which means the movie completely failed for me. The reason why he wants to be declared human (because apparently he has a desire to make love) demeans not just the book, but humanity itself. By the way, what happened to the Sesquicentennial Robot?And then jarringly, Andrew becomes the character of the book, but without the connecting points. Suddenly he stands in front of the court asking to be a human. Andrew's claim that he has invented prosthetic devices comes as a great surprise, for up to this point Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt) is the man we see doing this work.And so on and on and on.There are so many times that the movie absolutely fails Asimov, but those that bother me the most are the ones that Asimov took specific pains to point out his world and the movie blatantly denies it to him. The scene of Galatea (Kiersten Warren) shouting at Rupert Burns is impossible by Asimov's Three Laws. He has several complete stories of how even mentally hurting a human being creates such conflict in a robot (Liar!, is one example) as to destroy it. The nurse in the final scene, presumably an android robot, under orders unplugs Portia &#150; which essentially renders every robot story written by Asimov meaningless.Yes, I am disappointed.Movies need not stick to the original storyline, and often do not have the time to show every aspect of the book. Certainly, The Bicentennial Man was a long story (it is somewhere between a short story and a book) to be captured in its full essence in 90 minutes. That, however, is not an excuse here. This could have been broken down into sequels, especially in these days of trilogies. I wait for another production of this story true to Asimov. They - Asimov and Andrew - deserve it.PS Why 4 out of 10? I don't know. Maybe because if I rated it less, you wouldn't read this.

The only stipulation that the word bicentennial be used in the title. From this particle of an idea, Isaac Asimov developed what would become one of his most poignant and beloved stories.So it's a shame that the usual committee of fools in Hollywood got their hands on the tale, rather than someone who really appreciated it. Just as with the later I, Robot, this movie takes a nicely written Asimov theme and repackages it for a generic audience with the taste, intellect, and attention span of a ten-year-old.There are a lot of poorly-made movies out there (sometimes I think I've seen all of them) but rarely am I as profoundly disappointed as I was with this film. Not only did director Chris Columbus miss the point of the story, his movie entirely missed the FEEL of the story. There was no need to have pointless humor here, nor a love interest, nor any number of other distractions (not to mention lightweight comic Robin Williams in the lead; this would have been a perfect role for an understated performance by someone like Kevin Spacey.) It's a pity that the executives chose the low-and-easy road rather than for once challenging, ever so slightly, their audience.A case in point the profoundly stupid (no other word for it) scene near the beginning, when Asimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics are introduced. These were a recurring theme in his robot fiction, a logical hurdle the author placed in his characters' way to provide a scaffold on which to build the plots. The laws are key to the events in Bicentennial Man as well. Understandably, since not every viewer would be familiar with them, some method was needed to explain the laws to the audience. Yet rather than simply beginning the movie with these stated on the screen, they were trotted out to quite literal fanfares and fireworks. This silly approach seemed, frankly, a bit insulting. Implicit in the spectacle was Columbus' disdain for science fiction and all who enjoy it, as if to say (to all the non-fans in his audience) hey, here's the silly premise for this geek movie! If you've never read Bicentennial Man, it's conceivable you may well enjoy this film somewhat, as a typical mildly entertaining Robin Williams vehicle. But if you have read and appreciated the story, just go read it again. If you see this movie, you'll only ruin it for yourself.

It's not worth it.Through a quirk in his programming, a robot slowly turns into Robin Williams over the course of two centuries.In 2004, this robot rolled up to the Martin family's front door and does the obligatory explanation of Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. At first assigned to menial housekeeping, his interaction with the family (especially Little Miss Amanda Martin, the younger sister) causes some creativity to spring up in his quirky little brain. The father, Richard Martin, wants to nurture this, but the robot's manufacturer wants to deactivate him because his whole imagination is a programming bug. This is quickly dismissed and is never mentioned again. So much for the villain.The robot is eventually nicknamed Andrew. He starts to become more human over the course of time. He starts making things out of wood. He builds a house. He gets skin and clothes. A random puppy appears for no reason, upping the schmaltz to ridiculous levels and dropping the feasibility to an all-time low.Andrew goes on a quite literal soul-searching journey to find any others of his kind and see if they have souls too. None of them do, but by some absolutely tremendous coincidence, he meets the guy that will manufacture his skin and clothes, but Andrew just won't stop pushing! Soon he gets nerves to feel pain, a digestive system, fully operational organs (which, coincidentally, revolutionize medicine and make Andrew very rich), but even after a number of legal battles, he's still a robot!SPOILER There's one last thing he needs blood. Now he will age, decay, be mortal, be human. He's declared the world's oldest living man either before or while he's dying. Figures. END SPOILERAll sorts of hilarious things happen during Andrew's 200-year life. Grace Martin, the older sister, resents him and asks him to jump out the window. When Grace becomes a biker tramp, Andrew tries to intervene. Andrew becomes Mr. Martin's camcorder. Andrew becomes frustrated with an old gramophone, calling it a piece of fecal matter. He asks Little Miss' granddaughter to slap him, and he screams IT WORKS!SPOILER Andrew eventually marries. He and his wife are lying on their deathbed together. He dies first, his wife says See you soon, fade out on a shot of two hands holding. END SPOILERYou can guess, like many a Chris Columbus film, it grabs for every sentiment that can be crammed into two arduous hours. I'm all for sentiment, but only when it happens, not when its thrust upon me without motivation. Never mind that there's no conflict except for dull legal battles; we don't want anything to get in the way of the awwwwww... The film presents interesting spiritual questions; is a soul created by emotion and kindness, which would mean that anything that exhibits these can earn its soul, or would the presence of emotion and kindness mean that the thing's soul existed to begin with, even if it's trapped in an immortal shell that could never release it, or is the supposed soul just emotion and kindness and isn't a real thing?Unfortunately, these ideas drown in romantic nonsense and is hardly explored. The film sets up how Andrew's imagination came to be reasonably well, but when we saw the still-robotic Andrew wearing a tux at Richard's second wedding, that was it. It's ironic that the film becomes more mechanical and rusty when Andrew becomes less so.

In addition, the end of the movie where there is a world court that took it upon themselves to decide that a robot was just as much of a human as anyone else. How nice of them. I'm guessing that they had decided around fifty years earlier that a cockroach also had as many rights. And then there is the nice closing line where the movie assumes that this piece of junk metal thing was going to heaven or some other afterlife. What complete rubbish. It wasn't even an entertaining extremist anti-humanist film. The whole sex thing with the robot was also very forced and unnecessary.

Sam Neill was very disappointing in this film as he has done good stuff like Jurassic Park. That annoying kid at the beginning was far too cute and it was a relief when she bogged off. There were three things that the film got wrong. 1. As I mentioned before, the story was not about romance. 2. Andrew Martin was only called Andrew because of his serial number of NDR not because that annoying kid thought android sounded like Andrew! 3. The term bicentennial man was given to Andrew because he was called a sesquicentennial robot when he was 150. There were other mistakes in this too like that stupid female robot that danced. Completely unfunny. The book was not a comedy. This was one for Williams' ego as a great actor. He really is not. Anyway, ignore this film if you have read the story. Complete tripe.

The plot is very obvious from the very start and where it goes will be of no surprise to anyone &#150; the only surprise is just how very long it seems to take to get there. Along the way the film is far too simplistic and fails quite spectacularly to make interesting or thought-provoking points out of the material, instead it just tugs the heartstrings in a rather lazy fashion without really looking for the brain to be involved. Rather irritatingly the film does this for just under two hours and then suddenly becomes rather preachy out of nowhere &#150; this was poor because it had done nothing up till this point to try and make me think about the moral complexities of the story and the characters but then suddenly it starts shouting at me? No thanks!The film has the mark of Williams all over it. His performance is far too simplistic and easy and just trades on his usual mushy performances to no great effect. His rather gooey-eyed character is just a pain and I found it impossible to attach myself to him emotionally. The various other actors come and go in various roles down the generations and the only ones that really stuck in my mind were Neill and Platt &#150; Kiersten Warren was particularly annoying here and her character made me want to cover my ears and eyes.Overall this film will appeal to some as this mush is the sort of mush that many films have been trading on successfully for years and years. However I wanted actual emotional involvement as opposed to sentimentality, and I got none of that. Also I wanted some moral complexities &#150; hell, they practically come with the territory but the film made it all to mushy and straightforward and sucked the thought-provoking nature of the story right out.
