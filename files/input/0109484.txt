Bearing in mind the subject matter, this movie could have been one of those tearjerkers that leaves you feeling absolutely drained and depressed but I found it uplifting with just the right amounts of levity, tragedy and romance. I am fan of the Fifties music and fashion and this made me feel as though I was transported back to that era.  I had a whole rush of emotions watching this, most of which were positive.  There are touches in this film which make me feel warm inside - the whole movie radiates warmth.

When his wife dies, Manny's whole life falls apart, his daughter stops speaking, and he develops a creative block on his jingle-writing skills that threatens to get him fired. To solve one of these problems, he starts looking for a nanny for Molly, reluctantly settling on Corrina Washington (Whoopi Goldberg), a woman who has recently moved into town to stay with her sister, and who also happens to be black. Though far from the most efficient housekeeper in the town, Corrina clicks instantly with Molly, who eventually starts to speak again. Manny also takes a shine to Corrina, and a friendship soon forms between the two widows, but they can't seem to agree on what is best for Molly.As easy as it may be to classify 'Corrina, Corrina' as a fifties-set drama, I'm inclined to resist this temptation, for two main reasons. Firstly, aside from the underlying comments about race, the fifties setting is used only as a backdrop, with the focus on a very heartfelt dramedy, which leads me to my second point. 'Corrina, Corrina' is certainly moving, and there are times when you may feel the need to reach for a box of tissues. But it's also quite hilarious as well, and writer/director Jessie Nelson finds a fine balance between the dramatic and comedic beats to make a remarkable motion picture. Liotta, Goldberg and Majorino give wonderful performances, and these really do feel like real characters.

As Manny tries to find a suitable 'nurse maid' for Molly so he can go back to work, Corrina Washington (in the form of Whoopi Goldberg) comes into the picture and eventually gets hired by Manny to take care of the little girl. The funny thing is, what the Singers weren't expecting was for Corrina to bring magic back into their lives. An endearing little treasure, 'Corrina, Corrina' is a motion picture filled with heart and laughter, that's sure to send your spirits soaring.

Manny Singer's (Ray) wife has just died leaving him and his 7 year old daughter (Tina) behind. Molly is a little lost after this and she doesn't speak a word to her father or anyone else. After employing a plethora of disastrous nannys Manny finally comes to Corrina, who is perfect.

Corrina and Manny fall in love against all odds, and what you get is a beautiful interracial romance that at that time is classed as wrong, even abnormal. No one approves apart from Molly and her Grandfather (Don Ameche).One down side to this film, and I will add that it is the only down side, is the ending - you don't really know what happens. If I hadn't done a little research then I wouldn't have known that director Jessie Nelson had based this film on her true life story. She's black and her now husband of 40 odd years was white.

I started watching Corrina, Corrina as I ate lunch on a Saturday afternoon, it happened to be on television. I ended up watching the entire film, and noticed that my mom was distracted from her work as well.Whoopi Goldberg is at her best as Corrina, an intelligent black woman in the 1950's who has a college degree but because of her skin colour she has to work as a maid. She enters the life of Molly and Manny Singer, who have lost their mom and wife respectively, and Molly, up to this point traumatised, warms to Corrina, as I'm sure most of the audience did.The film teaches morals of religion, black-white relations and anti-smoking (though this last moral is sort of lost) but it does not stick them down your throat. It is funny and Jessie Nelson does some quite experimental and beautiful shots, especially the colours.It fulfills the requirement of overdone touchy scenes but somehow the performances make it much better, and tina marjorino plays a large role in this.

In my opinion, the film is not just a sweet story, it speaks of the issues that our society has about both race and about social class in our society - both in the 50's as well as today.  It IS a movie about love across social boundaries, it can also speak to the seeming obsession of society about the differences of, not only race, but also religion. What is wonderful about this movie is that it shows that this obsession goes both ways.  And it has come to a point where, understandably,members of the most persecuted groups in out society, end up in situations, like in Corrina, Corrina, where they themselves are pressured by their own family and community to sever the relationship that they want to be in.  This movie shows the pressure that both sides go through when deciding to enter an inter-racial or even an inter-faith relationship, and it shows that sometimes the pressure put on the member of a certain group in society goes through, more because their community feels, although often for good reasons, that the person of the dominant community, whatever it may be in whatever society, is not to be trusted.  This movie shows that sometimes love and trust are true, regardless of the real and regardless of the sometimes imagined boundaries that society can place between people.

Despite this picture's lack of popular appeal and box office performance, it would seem intolerant to suggest that this picture is not a moving or deeply thought-provoking.The picture, set during the late 1950s, is a wonderful depiction of how two people so different can come together at a time when it wasn't politically or socially acceptable. The true stars of this movie, Goldberg and Liotta, portray the taboo of an interracial relationship at the time and convey this difficulty with such serenity and authenticity.The infrequent injections of Goldberg's comedy enable the film to be not just a sadistic and morbid tale of the hardships of America's shame, but an attempt to remind audiences that we have finally reached a place of equality where interracial love is acceptable. Goldberg's character is utilized as a tool to encourage mediation between the lost Manny and his daughter Overall, Corrina, Corrina is a truly beautiful film that raises the question of African-Americans being accepted into white society and serves a message to illustrate the history of America's black peoples and how, really, we're all the same.

They don't come right out and say this, but instead blame it on typical Hollywood liberalism.I don't agree.

Ray Liotta immediately begins looking for a nanny to watch after his daughter so he can return to work. Whoopi Goldberg, who plays the title character, is the only one who seems to be able to reach the daughter and bring her out of her shell. The dynamics of Tina and Whoopi's relationship are what give the movie a real special quality. Whoopi, as always, is a joy to watch.

The Little Rock desegregation episode occurred as late as 1957 and the Civil Rights marches were some time in the future,few blacks felt secure enough to go against the wishes of their white employers or even cuss and swear in their presence. Clearly there is a strong political edge to this movie,it could hardly be otherwise given our current obsession with racial and religious tensions both in the U.S and the U.K.Black Christian woman and white atheist Jew fall in love - I'm not sure how convincingly - but conveniently,for the very basis of the movie is that love laughs at locksmiths.Would that it were true. From Romeo and Juliet onwards playwrights have been telling us it isn't,but we're still clinging on to the hope. A few remarkable people succeeded in ignoring the social pressures,but even in the 21st century race and religion are barriers that can prove insurmountable. Commendably, in Corrina Corrina nobody pretends it's going to be easy for Mr Liotta and Miss Goldberg.It is a measure of the film's effectiveness that I felt concerned for their future.

As you might imagine, not only does Corrina form a touching bond straight away with Molly, but another bond of a different type seems to be developing with her father...The 1950's setting is wonderful. Of course race becomes something of an issue here (white employer, black housekeeper) and that era gives it all the more impact. Corrina's (black, needless to say) family and her relationship to it are well portrayed in the film . Also, Corrina isn't exactly docile, will not be trodden upon, and has no difficulty in speaking her piece to her new employer, a feat which, as you can imagine, Whoopi is more than capable of pulling off.The little actress playing Molly is a jewel. Her character is spirited with a mind of her own as well. Lovable but a bit of a handful in her own right.

Recommended as a good alternative to the usual television fare for a peaceful Saturday night of enjoyment.

Some of it might be considered blaxploitation there is the usual rap about those soulful, warm-hearted, gospel-crooning, double-dutching black communities vs. the hypocritical, gossipy, selfish whites&#133; Nothing outrageous, though, since the tone always remains gentle. Goldberg still does her 'sister' act, but she's harnessed. Liotta is a real softie here. The only time he gets a bit angry, it seems out of character.  Nice, understated ending. This is good, sound family viewing.

I had seen most of it on TNT/TBS over the years and liked what I saw. Being a big fan of Whoop I felt obligated to buy the DVD... I was not in the least bit sorry. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, I watch it all the time. Whoop once again uses her charm, this time as a housekeeper/caretaker to a little sweetheart named Molly Singer (played to heart-stealing perfection by 9-year-old Tina Majorino), a motherless child with a loveable daddy (Ray Liotta) living in 50s suburbia. The aesthetic kids always steal the show is very much evident here. Majorino is the sweetest and most talented child actor today (she puts Hayley Joel Osment to total shame). Her laugh, smile and tears are so infectious you'd wish she were your own. Ray Liotta and Whoop are both memorable as Molly's two favorite people and the classy 50s soundtrack is a must-have. The story is evenly balanced to keep it from getting too maudlin and sickeningly-sweet. So if there's anyone who loves a great family movie who hasn't seen this winner, I highly recommend CORRINA, CORRINA.

Her father Manny (Ray Liotta) is helpless. He hires sassy nanny Corrina Washington (Whoopi Goldberg). She's educated and aspires to write for magazines. The interview doesn't go well but Molly seems to interact with her. Molly slowly opens up to Corrina. Manny is an atheist and so was his wife. Corrina comforts Molly by telling her that her mom is in heaven. His co-workers set him with Jenny Davis (Wendy Crewson) with her own two boys. Molly is being bullied at school and she doesn't want to go to school. It's the last 50s. Manny and Corrina develop a relationship and many people aren't happy about it.I do have a problem with Liotta and Goldberg pairing. Goldberg has never been the romantic type and I don't see her with any sexual chemistry. That makes the relationship problematic for a mainstream movie. There seems to be a few other general problems in this movie. Writer/director Jessie Nelson sets up a lot of stuff but they all seem to be left unresolved. She sets up the religious angle and nothing really happens. There is the racial angle but it never heats up to a point of danger. That doesn't accentuate the drama. It's almost as if the movie is more scared of the material than the audience. Tina Majorino is adorable. She keeps the heart in this story. This could have been a much better movie.

But I stop dead in my tracks to watch...The daughter is confronted as a N lover. She reailzes that the word means a black person, but she does not realize that the word is a racial slur. As far as she is concerned, she is with the people who love her, and she loves them, in the pure way that it seems only children can love, in return.These omissions are an example to me of how some networks, and more broadly a Black actress(I've heard her say that she doesn't like the term African American-we're ALL Americans I seem to remember...) is missplaced even in this decade. The Oscar win is not a fluke. Hollywood has yet to face or offer an opportunity that truly shows off her full potential.I feel that her peer is Robin Williams in terms of a comedian that Hollywood still has yet to see their potential.

The formula in this film has been done better before, but probably not among the romantic comedies churned out by Hollywood in the 80s and 90s.Corrina, Corrina is a mainstream Hollywood romantic comedy that unfortunately falls into some of the banal conventions of this often overworked genre.  It is an overly simplistic, often implausible fantasy but is more than redeemed by its unorthodox (for Hollywood) direction, lighting, and acting.Also, the soundtrack (made up of jazz greats like Bill Evans) is one of the best I've heard in a mainstream flick.Oh yea, and Tina Majorino is spectacular.

She also brings love back into the little girl's father's life, despite the gossip and backbiting from both sides of the racial divide.

It's simply a tender movie of a new family drawn together.

This is the finest child actress I have ever seen. It's as if she has no awareness that a camera is focused on her every movement. She is just a child. And, as Molly Singer, a little girl whose mother has just died, she is more than believable. On that one fact rests the success of this great film. If Molly were any less than this fine actress portrays her, no one would care whether Whoopy and Ray get together.Not to minimize Whoopy Goldberg and Ray Liotta. They are excellent. Everyone is, except the actress who overplays the grandmother. She lays on heavy gravy Eastern European schmaltz and smothers her scenes. Too bad she's not the one in the coffin.This was Don Ameche's last film, and a fitting exit it is. He doesn't say much, but if you are an Ameche fan, be sure and sit through the final rolling credits. Corrina Corrina is a wonderful movie with wonderful music. The sound track is worth the watching experience all by itself.

It's about Manny Singer who's wife has just passed away and his 7-year-old daughter Molly has trouble adjusting to life without her mother around. Molly uses the silent treatment around Manny and a couple of nannies since she is having trouble coping. One day a very friendly black woman named Corrina Washington comes by and decides to be Molly's nanny since she's good with children as she puts it. Molly soon gets to like Corrina and comes out of her silent mood, but is still dismayed by her mother's death. Corrina teaches the youngster everything-how to clean floors and valuables, how to hula-hoop, and how to play the piano. Manny soon realizes that he's practically in love with Corrina when they sit outside on a soft chair together. Trouble soon arises when Manny receives a phone call at work saying that Corinna has not been taking Molly to school everyday. Manny is mad at both Corinna and Molly for lying to him and he fires Corinna as Molly's nanny but soon re-hires her when Molly insists that Corinna is to come back.                              There are a lot of sad parts in this movie like when Manny's father dies suddenly from sickness. That really broke my heart. I cried when Manny broke an expensive green vase that his friend from work bought for him since he was angry over his father's death and for losing another person in his life. This was a sad movie but love and care touched me in this movie.

The first interviewee is an old-fashioned-looking (dress, mannerisms, speech) who immediately lays down here strict rules, stating that there will be two hours of Bible study ever day.This is said, of course, to make it sound like reading the Bible is the worse punishment you could ever inflict on someone, especially a kid. Once again, the Bible is equated with stuffy, mean-spirited people.
