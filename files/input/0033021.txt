[{"Title":"A Very Unusual Mixture of Bad and Good History","Date":"26 May 2003","Score":"44 out of 51 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":"  Santa Fe Trail, a 1940 film that brought a number of rising stars together, mixes gross distortion of history with an unusual, compelling and honest confrontation with the age of slavery.Hollywood's uses (and, more often, abuses) of history fascinate me.  Some films try to stick close to accounts generally accepted while others openly employ characters from real life as a launch point for stories that have little to do with actual events (hey, if Shakespeare could do it...).  Many films blend fiction with fact and, usually, they serve neither well.Director Michael Curtiz's Santa Fe Trail is part western, part military history, part comedic romance.  Olivia de Havilland, fresh from her Gone With the Wind adventure, plays a frontier girl with spunk - and an ability to keep her clothes clean almost always, no matter what.  She is pursued by two young army lieutenants, the soon to be legendary Confederate cavalry office, J.E.B. Stuart (Errol Flynn), and the eventually to be killed with his entire command George A. Custer (Ronald Reagan sans Bonzo).  The rival suitors are typically 1940s romantics - no unfair or nasty stuff here.  So sweet is the path to nuptial bliss.The story takes place before the Civil War when the Army tried to maintain peace between pro- and anti-slavery factions in Bloody Kansas.  The army officers who actually are part of history are portrayed here as being all members of the West Point Class of 1854-that would make Custer about seven years younger and earlier in graduating than was the case).  No big deal.What makes this film a remarkable document is its unflinching, for the Hollywood of the 1940s, portrayal of the evil of slavery, the pain of blacks ensnared in its web and the thundering role of John Brown, played by Raymond Massey in a powerful, gripping performance.John Brown, the abolitionist who in life and in the film murdered slavery supporters and seized the federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry, Virginia was a zealot, not a madman (he refused an opportunity to plead insanity at the trial which ended in his death sentence).  Massey, one of the greatest actors of all time, captures Brown's total devotion to ending slavery - he projects passion, not psychosis.  It seems to me that Massey had a picture of John Brown that he was determined to bring to life, the inane or frivolous parts of the film being totally irrelevant to his mission.Hollywood before World War II generally treated blacks as minor props (waiters, Pullman car attendants, cooks and maids).  Here a black family is traumatized by truly sinister racists.  Brown's condemnations of slavery are taken from his speeches and writings.  The film's producer and director and script writers took a major detour from the concerted Tinseltown effort to not produce any story that might cut into box office take in the South (and elsewhere-the North was no hotbed of campaigns for racial equality).Worth seeing because of its unique take on slavery, for the time, and Raymond Massey's towering performance.8/10.

Then I grew up and found out it was all a big contrivance.  It almost quashed my love for this movie.But the truth did not succeed to extinguish my love.  The entertainment value of this movie is astounding and sometimes thrilling - but the historical value is so misguided that it almost ruins it for me.  I now feel that, though this movie makes a sham of history - - it is a great showcase for the wonderful talents of Michael Curtiz, Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan and Olivia de Havilland.I particularly love the final rescue scene.  It is choreographed and orchestrated so beautifully, it is hard not to be taken into the maelstrom of John Brown's destiny.  Those battle trumpets still cause a chill to go up my spine.Before I was old enough to understand the true nature of this tale, I visited Harper's Ferry and felt an honest chill when I visited the firehouse where John Brown and his men were captured. I touched the walls and stood in awe at being so close to such a fateful edifice. It is now called John Brown's Fort because he was holed up in there for three days in October 1859.  So close before the fateful Civil War embroiled our nation in its saddest chapter.  But the building was a fire engine and guard house when it was built in 1848 and moved to Boston for display and then later, back to Harper's Ferry to a place about 150 feet east of its original location.  The original location had become a railroad embankment...so it could not stand at the original spot.Whatever you think about the historical inaccuracies of this film, its entertainment values are excellent for their own sake.RAYMOND MASSEY is especially memorable as John Brown.  His earnest and single-minded portrayal of a madman-with-a-quest is the great stand-out of this movie.  The far-away gaze and fiery eyes are almost hypnotic in its concentration. I also enjoyed watching Ronald Reagan and Errol Flynn do their stuff as no one else can.  These are actors that for better or worse will always stand out from the Hollywood fray with their own special brand of something indescribable and timeless.Watch this movie with a grain or two or historical salt.  Enjoy it for its sheer fun value.

Though it is in no way a classic like Gone With the Wind, it's view of the coming Civil War is not too dissimilar from the David O. Selznick film that also had Olivia DeHavilland as one of its stars. It was a popularly held view of the time, the abolitionists were well intentioned rabble rousers who brought on the Civil War and as Errol Flynn as J.E.B. Stuart says, the south will settle the slavery issue in its own time.Back in the day even in A westerns like Santa Fe Trail, liberal use of the facts involving noted historical figures was taken. The fact that Stuart, Custer, Longstreet, Pickett, Sheridan, and Hood would all graduate West Point in the same class was really a minor bending of the rules. The following year with Errol Flynn as Custer in They Died With Their Boots On, they got Custer's graduation class right, but then compounded his life with more errors.One interesting fact that no one mentions in this film is Henry O'Neill as the real life Cyrus K. Holliday (1826-1900) who considerably outlived just about everyone portrayed in the film. He's of critical importance in Kansas history as having built the Santa Fe railroad. His children neither went to West Point as William Lundigan, did graduating with all these Civil War heroes, nor did his daughter wind up marrying one.Olivia DeHavilland playing her usual heroine, gets out of the crinoline for a bit as a Calamity Jane type daughter to Henry O'Neill. I have to say she showed quite a bit more spunk than her normal range of leading ladies at the time at Warner Brothers. She certainly Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan as George A. Custer on their toes.If people remember anything at all about Santa Fe Trail today it is Raymond Massey as the fanatical John Brown. Yet even there, Brown has his hypocritical moments when he's quite ready to let a barn full of recent runaway slaves burn down so he can kill Errol Flynn in it. It doesn't ring true with the character as defined by Massey, I fault the scriptwriters there. Massey repeated his John Brown character in the later Seven Men From Now. Other than Abraham Lincoln it is the role that actor is most identified with.As an action western though, Santa Fe Trail can't be beat. The battle scene with the army breaking John Brown's siege at Harper's Ferry is well staged. You really do think you are at Harper's Ferry watching a newsreel.Though it never was history and hasn't worn well in its interpretation, western fans will still like Santa Fe Trail.

Some viewers will see it as a tribute to the chivalrous values of the pre-civil war military establishment, which was dominated by southern aristocrats like General Robert E. Lee, while others may see it mainly as the tragic saga of the anti-slavery martyrs of Harper's Ferry, whose self-sacrifice brought on the war to free the slaves. Cavalry officer Jeb Stuart seems either gallant and nobly courageous, or like a pompous martinet, while abolitionist John Brown is a violence loving madman, or one of the most dedicated and selfless heroes of all time. This exciting, action-packed movie refuses to take sides but permits the viewer to make his own decisions about the important themes presented.What about its use of history, though, which has vexed so many critics? Like any great mythopoeic work, Santa Fe Trail should be judged not as historical record but as a legend or myth that tells universal truths. Historicism, which in movie criticism is the theory that all works should be judged by the standard of recorded history, has not enjoyed much favor among the most respected experts on the subject of art. Were this not so, the Iliad, Macbeth and The Adventures of Robin Hood would long ago have been rejected as false history, because not one of them is faithful to many of the known facts deemed so important by historicist critics.Judged on its own terms and from the perspective of facts that have proved true not just in one place and time but in many places and in many periods of history, then Santa Fe Trail is a classic in the best sense, and thrilling entertainment too. Like all war movies that are any good, it is a powerful anti-war movie.

This is an insidious movie that pollutes History even more than normal Hollywood fare. It had nothing to do with The Santa Fe Trail, but dealt with abolitionist John Brown from Kansas to Harpers Ferry in the years before the Civil War, and the reaction of West Point officers to him.  So what's wrong with it? It is nothing but pro-Slaveholder anti-black propaganda. 1. Atrocities by pro-slavery forces in Kansas were never depicted, just those by Brown. 2. Brown was never shown treating blacks with respect and as equals. As he always did. 3. Blacks were only depicted as shiftless, helpless stereotypes. 4. One third of Brown's fighters at Harpers Ferry were black - none were depicted in the movie. 5. The assault against Brown at Harpers was preposterous - about six times the size of the actual fight. 6. West Point cadets were shown as mostly pro-slavery, and abolitionist cadets were depicted as crackpots and the cause of the Civil War. 7. John Brown's famous and magnificent speech before the Court was not shown. 8. John Brown was denounced as a traitor - by the Robert E Lee character who would soon renounce his West Point oath and fight against the United States - UNlike many other Virginia officers. I could go on. But this movie should only be shown in a classroom as an example of propaganda and deceit.

Errol Flynn stars as J.E.B. Stuart, fresh out of West Point and now stationed at Fort Leavenworth in the Kansas territory, the starting point of the westward Santa Fe Trail. This was particularly hazardous country at the time, because abolitionist John Brown (Raymond Massey) was conducting violent raids along the trail. It quickly becomes the duty of Stuart and his pal Custer (Ronald Reagan) to capture Brown dead or alive, and put and end to his attacks.There are many exciting sequences in the film, leading up to the final confrontation at Harper's Ferry.  There's also a predictable romantic triangle between Flynn, Reagan and Olivia de Havilland.  (Guess which one she picks!)  The movie deserves credit for taking an objective viewpoint toward Brown, acknowledging that his motives were good even if his methods were not.As Stuart, Flynn proves to be equally adroit in westerns as in swashbucklers.  Reagan and de Havilland fill their less demanding roles with ease, and Alan Hale and Guinn `Big Boy' Williams provide much-needed comic relief.  Massey somewhat overplays his hand as Brown, however.  He comes off as too sanctimonious, more a cliché villain than a three-dimensional human being.Apparently, the film is a travesty in terms of historical accuracy.  Who cares?  Movies are an entertainment medium.  Anyone seeking facts alone had better confine their search to encyclopedias.  Otherwise, just sit back and be amused.

It's mainly about the activities of self-proclaimed slave abolitionist John Brown and his efforts to provoke a war between the North and South.The film begins in 1854 at West Point where a number of historical figures who would play prominent roles in the Civil War, are about to graduate. Leading the pack are JEB Stuart (Errol Flynn) and George Armstrong Custer (Ronald Reagan). Robert E. Lee (Moroni Olsen) is the Commandant of West Point and Jefferson Davis (Erville Anders) is the Minister of War. John Brown (Raymond Massey) is conducting bloody raids all over Kansas and has placed an operative, Rader (Van Heflin) within West Point. Stuart and Custer meanwhile, foil Rader and are competing for the affections of Kit Carson Holliday (Olivia de Havilland) the daughter of railroad magnate Cyrus K. Holliday (Henry O'Neill) who hopes to extend the railroad to New Mexico along, you guessed it, the Santa Fe Trail.There is some very good action sequences ably directed by Michael Curtiz. Future Cvil War adversaries fight side by side against Brown and his followers but are coming to realize that the issue of slavery will not die with Brown.Raymond Massey steals the acting honors as Brown the slightly mad but dedicated revolutionary. Flynn, Reagan and DeHavilland form the usual love triangle that always seemed to be a staple of the Warner Bros. westerns of the period. Alan Hale and Guinn Williams are along to provide the comedy relief. Heflin in an early role, is also excellent as Rader who seems to have his own agenda.Also in the cast mostly unbilled, are Alan Baxter, Joseph Sawyer and for B movie fans, Charles Middleton, Trevor Bardette, Lane Chandler, Lafe McKee and Roy Barcroft (if you blink you'll miss him).There's plenty of action and romance to keep the die-hard western fan happy. One of the better Warner Bros. A westerns of the period.

Sensitive to Southern moviegoers still smarting 75 years after Appomattox, the filmmakers present a convoluted tale where all of the terribleness of the War Between the States can be laid on the doorstep of that terrible scourge Abolitionism.Anti-slavery terrorist John Brown is on the loose, and it's up to Flynn to stop him, as future Confederate legend J.E.B. Stuart, still a U.S. Army officer as the war looms on the horizon. Stuart is presented as a champion not of slavery but of the status quo it is his duty to protect. Still, it's hard to find merit in his stance. The South will settle it, Stuart says about slavery, but in its own time and in its own way. No use rushing into righting an 80-year wrong, right?Director Michael Curtiz and scripter Robert Buckner fall short in terms of story, too. Is this a Western? Or is it a love story? Again, cinematic economics are pretty transparent given how awkwardly Olivia is shoehorned into the film, standing on the sidelines and wringing her hands. She's beautiful and charming, but her scenes with Flynn are overlong compendiums of romantic cliché, made worse by a melodramatic and hyperactive Max Steiner score.Playing the token liberal here is Ronald Reagan as George Armstrong Custer. Read that last sentence back if you want to know why some people really hate this film. There's a purpose behind that madness, Custer says of Brown, one that cannot easily be dismissed. But Custer doesn't protest too long, and the implication is clear that whatever Brown is fighting for doesn't outweigh his endangering the Union, for Custer or Stuart.Luckily for the filmmakers, they had Raymond Massey on hand to play Brown, eloquent in word but constantly threatening to go off the deep end. Massey was a florid overactor, but he had in Brown the right part and makes the most of it. Even better is Van Heflin, as a nasty bravo named Rader whom Stuart tangles with at West Point and again later on when Rader inserts himself as one of Brown's deputies. Rader's a great foil, allowed to say some worthy things about the anti-slavery cause, but more compelling in how his anger-choked personality comes to clash with that of the self-righteous Brown. Heflin grabs every scene he's in with those beady eyes and high forehead, and it's probably why he rose to movie prominence soon after.Far less successful is the film's effort to develop a romantic rivalry between Stuart and Custer. We have a pretty good idea de Havilland won't wind up with the Gipper. Alan Hale and Guinn Williams bicker like old maids for the sake of bad comedy, playing a pair of battle-hungry cowhands Calling me a rumpot's what hurt me...I haven't had a drink since noon!Even Curtiz the celebrated action director falters here. Halfway through the film there's a battle where Brown and his men hold up Stuart's troops, then ride off with a cache of weapons, leaving Stuart's force inexplicably still armed. Vastly outnumbered, Stuart chases them anyway. Brown obliges him by not turning around to fight, leaving the cache behind.Hey, wait a minute, they outnumber us three-to-one, protests Custer. With an attitude like that, he'll never make the history books.However factually and dramatically flawed, Santa Fe Trail is one for the history books, in a way that shows how imperfectly the United States was coming to terms with its slave-holding past three generations on. It's not a good film even without its moral dubiousness, but that same dubiousness makes it historically worthy, as a reflection of just how hard it was for a nation to face a searing legacy of accepting the treatment of human beings as cattle.

Along the way they compete for the affections of the railroad magnate's daughter (rather than either of the fascinating women that Stuart and Custer really ended up with), and... oh, why bother?

Or was there no point at all to it? Frankly I'm not sure which is worse.

Errol Flynn plays Jeb Stuart. while Ronald Reagan plays George Custer and Olivia de Havilland, trying to select from the two. Far fetched as that is, the audience spends more time watching John Brown fight with the U.S. army, instead of the scenery along the trail. Were it not for the comic relief of Alan Hale or the serious addition of Van Heflin, the movie would have have garnered little more than a ho-hum.

The co-starring team is charming, as usual; and, Ms. de Havilland creates a great female characterization, with the limited material given. The best performance is offered by Van Heflin (as Carl Rader); his character grabs the spotlight very early, and never really lets go. Although it would have been out of the question in a Flynn film, it might have been nice to retool the script around Mr. Heflin's duplicitous character. Mr. Massey, a bug-eyed psycho at one point, would play a more flattering Brown in Seven Angry Men (1955).The film plays too fast and loose with facts for comport. Its point of view is not vague that the South recognized the immorality of slavery, and would have worked it out peacefully; and, that abolitionists practiced unnecessary terrorism.

The fact is we are not talking about whether the Winchester repeating rifle was really invented by 1850. The abolitionists are painted as violent, crazy, murderous people, the reason why Kansas is called Bloody Kansas. Anyone who knows anything about this tragic period knows that pro-slavery forces were first to engage in murder and pillage. John Brown was notable because he was the first free-stater who started murdering back, and he made a campaign of it. After that, wholesale murder was found on both sides.  THAT is why they called it Bloody Kansas. What we see in the movie, however, is only John Brown's violence, time after time. We also see simple-minded black folks who would have been better off if John Brown hadn't made them free and responsible for feeding themselves. You can try and enjoy the story for itself, but the ugly and badly slanted arguments against abolitionists (and by extension against any reform of Jim Crow Laws in the 1940s) make it appalling viewing.

This was one of perhaps a dozen that the local station had in the package they owned and all the neighborhood gang would congregate to watch their movie show whenever Flynn, (or Abbott and Costello) were on. I remember those times fondly and thus am apt to be more forgiving than most toward the historical inaccuracies and dated attitudes. Even 1940 is history now- it's almost been as long since then as it had since the Civil War when the film was made.  	Still, you can't ignore the history and the attitudes. The film's premise is that many of the major figures of the Civil War- especially the ones who became boy generals, were all in the West Point Class of 1854 and that several of them served in bleeding Kansas and at Harper's Ferry. Some of what the film depicts is true. Some of it is not. John Brown did raid in Kansas in 1855-56 and then made the raid on Harper's Ferry on 10/16/59. There he was captured and later hung. Raymond Massey nails his performance as Brown, one of the most memorable in Hollywood history, (he would play him again in 1955's Seven Angry Men). One wonders what would happen if Brown and Lincoln had met- would they have recognized each other? Jefferson Davis was secretary of War in 1854, (but not in 1859). Robert E Lee was the commandant at West Point in 1854 and led the relief column at Harper's Ferry. JEB Stuart, (Errol Flynn),  graduated from the class of 1854, fought in Kansas and was present at Harper's Ferry. So far so good.	But George Custer, (Ronald Reagan, in a good performance), was part of the class of 1861 and was neither in Kansas or Harper's Ferry and probably never met Stuart. Philip Sheridan was class of 1953, as was John Bell Hood. George Pickett was class of 1846 and James Longstreet class of 1842, (Custer would have been three years old when Longstreet graduated). Stuart married the daughter of Union General Philip St. George Cook, who is not depicted here.	The tenor of the times is surely well represented, with moral confusion and conflict between friends. The most effective scene in the film is the one where the fortune teller, by the light of a campfire, tells all the young officers that they will someday fight one another. Their faces lighted by the flames, they react with nervous astonishment. Hollywood overlaid this confusion with their own ambivalence, stemming form the fact that white southerners were viewed as a more significant market than black audiences. Thus pro slavers are viewed with more sympathy than fanatical abolitionists and blacks are depicted in an absurd, bug-eyed, feet don't desert me now! fashion that is unwatchable to modern audiences and should have been to 1940 audiences but apparently wasn't. On top of that, the 1940 nervousness over the coming war is clearly reflected in these character's attitudes toward the coming war of 1861. I agree that the film is not pro slavery so much as it's against fanaticism and the John Brown/bin-Laden comparison some have made seems accurate. 	If you can look past all of that, you will see the film I and my youthful friends saw years ago- another rollicking Warner Brother's adventure film, with many of the same elements in the excellent series of Flynn westerns, such as Dodge City, Virginia City, They Died With Their Boots on, (which features an altogether different view of Custer's career) and San Antonio.

On one hand it does certain events well, such as the battle against Brown's men at the firehouse in Harper's Ferry.  But it does spread the lie that the Old South would have eventually ended the peculiar institution.  It is doubtful if that is true - historically many southern theorists were trying to encourage spreading slavery into factories and the mines of the North and West.  But the pleasant post-Civil War stories about faithful retainers, etc. were believed in 1940.  So the film tries to make the cause of abolitionism seem extremist.Well, with John Brown, it was extremist.  In 1856 he murdered several pro-slave men at Ossawattomie, Kansas, hacking them to death with a sword.  It is true that pro-slavery men (like Quantrill) would kill anti-slavery men, but that is no excuse.  Brown may have come from a family with an insanity problem.  That may be a partial excuse.But the problem of the film is that Brown's extremist point meshes into what eventually became the nation's - that slavery was an evil to be destroyed.  The film can't retain the pro-slavery viewpoint.  How to get out of this, as Brown's fanatical activities are the actions that spur the  behavior of the hero of the film (Errol Flynn as Jeb Stuart). Enter the crass, greedy Rader (Van Heflin) who betrays and wrecks Brown's plans at Harper's Ferry for money.  Massey's rise to heroism in the film's conclusion includes his confronting and killing Rader.  Brown may be crazy, but he had a view towards the future which we will adhere to.  In the end we reject his methods as too violent, but we do admire the man a bit.

Most of the action takes place in 'Bloody Kansas', still a territory in 1854 and home of Fort Leavenworth, the U.S. Army's most dangerous outpost. It's where hot headed members of West Point's graduating class of the same year wind up being assigned, including J.E.B. Stuart (Errol Flynn) of Virginia and George Custer (Ronald Reagan) of Ohio. Though the military men would find themselves on opposite sides in the Civil War, the film finds itself in the middle, straddling the line of dedication to duty and leaving matters of policy to civil authority. Depending on one's point of view, that's either noble or a cop out, as the soldiers face no moral quandaries. Their mission is simply to bring John Brown to justice, dead or alive.It's interesting to reflect on the film from a historical perspective today, some sixty six years after it was made, while only seventy five years after the end of the Civil War. The portrayal of blacks in movies often found single characters in subservient or comedic roles, but here a slave family on the way to freedom is portrayed as human, terrified of confrontation aboard a train bound for still neutral Kansas Territory. Their plight is given even more meaningful resonance later in the film when John Brown finds he must leave Kansas to avoid capture. Does just sayin' so make us free...? one of the former slaves wonders, fearing he may not be equipped for that privilege.Historical inaccuracies aside, I found the film to be exciting and entertaining, assembling many of Warner Brothers' stars and stock players, along with masterful director Michael Curtiz. Flynn and Reagan generally share equal screen time, vying for the attention of Kit Carson Holliday (Olivia DeHavilland), whose father Cyrus (Henry O'Neill) lends credence to the story's backdrop financing the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad. As in the same year's Virginia City, Flynn is supported by those two flat footed rum-pots, Guinn Big Boy Williams and Alan Hale, whose comedic camaraderie is injected at just the right moments. However when the spotlight is on Raymond Massey, it's difficult to turn away; the energy and zeal he brings to the character of John Brown is totally absorbing. His performance is reminiscent of an earlier portrayal, that of the unwavering protagonist Cabal in the 1936 film Things to Come.I'm surprised it took me so long to get around to Santa Fe Trail, since it's a public domain staple and available virtually everywhere as a single film or in compilation with other Westerns. For those who find it enjoyable, I'd also recommend They Died With Their Boots On, another Errol Flynn feature in which he's cast as General George Armstrong Custer. He gives Custer some of the flamboyance and arrogance that the history books recall, traits not acknowledged in Ronald Reagan's take on the character.

It has been suggested that this film can be enjoyed solely as an old-fashioned action/adventure film. I feel this is not possible as the views expressed in the film are so distorted and inaccurate. The film seems to have a very confused agenda. Our hero is pro-slavery.America in the period when this film is set was in no way unsure of how it felt about slavery. Abolitionists in the North were forced to use terrorist actions to forward their cause. Slave owners in the South had no desire to give up their profitable lives with emaciation. Every one had a strong opinion. That is why the American Civil War was fought, because of strong opinion. (Olivia) Kit Holliday The man on the train, he died for a principle. A man killed him fora principle. One of them is wrong! Which one? (Flynn) Jeb Stuart Who knows the answer to that question, Kit. Everybody in Americais trying to decide.I find it very hard to believe that these characters wouldn't have very strong opinions on such a subject. The other problem with the film is that abolitionists are portrayed as out and out villains, only to be regarded with suspicion. During an opening scene, the son of John Brown is trying to free a black family. He plays his part as if he is a deluded, misguided and desperate criminal. The blacks when featured are simple caricatures. The film is soaked in racism. This film was made in 1940, over 70 years after the emaciation of the slave. It feels as if the American Civil War was continuing in 1940 unabated, as many blacks of this period lived in conditions equal or worse than those of the Civil War. Human rights, justice and equality as yet a dream.A certain review of the film claims that political correctness gone mad has caused a lack of appreciation of a good film. The reviewer also claims that the American Civil War could have been avoided, as the South would have emancipated the slave eventually. My view is all wars can be avoided; yet to deprive American History of it's most documented and romanticised war would be to hurt too many Historians and re-enactors.Finally all that can be said about Santa Fe Trail is that it is a bad film.

Well, if this film reflects anything of the young Reagan's virtuosity, it seems we didn't miss much. Cast as Errol Flynn's best friend and love-rival, he comes over as the lesser half of the duo, and his limitations show up plainly - a handsome tailor's dummy who can speak clearly, but never with force or conviction.Here he is wearing the uniform of a US Army cadet, one of a troublesome gang who are punished by being sent on their first posting to Kansas, the edge of civilisation in 1855, and the scene of guerrilla fighting between abolitionists and pro-slavery patrols, often viewed as the curtain-raiser for the civil war.The opening is almost comic - a line of cadets being called out by name, all the names belonging to famous future generals who could not possibly have been at West Point in the same year. We could spend all night listing the other inaccuracies, but some details, at least, are historical. Robert E. Lee was indeed head of the military academy, who later arrested John Brown, with cavalry leader Jeb Stuart holding a white flag of truce, while trying to parley with the rebels. And it is also true that the religious maniac Brown was betrayed by his own Judas, for greed of gold.The title 'Santa Fe Trail' does not really signify anything much, except that the planners of the big new railroad are having to suspend work until John Brown's body is firmly in the grave, and the boss's beautiful daughter (Olivia De Havilland), is being competed-for by Stuart (Flynn) and Custer (Reagan) in a style almost reminiscent of Bing and Bob.Star of the show is Raymond Massey as Brown, hugely sinister both in physical presence and in ominous wild talk. Remembering that America must have known by 1940 that it was in for a long war, the political message had to be an appeal for national unity, so most of the characters come out against secession. This has divided modern critics, who are inclined to focus solely on that issue, some dismissing it as a pro-slavery film, others questioning Brown's belief that slavery could be ended only by bloodshed. Neutral observers now agree that slavery would have withered away by about 1880, and even Brown's supporters might accept that We recognise no law but the law of God is a bit of a cop-out.A disappointingly weak script by the prolific Robert Buckner. It is not too believable that an elderly Native American clairvoyant would tell the cadets that all of them would become generals, but that they would soon be fighting each other. And the De Havilland character looks odd walking up to an officer and saying Shall we dance? I thought they were just meant to wait and yearn.

Today, though, Reagan is the better-known name and recordings for home viewing seem usually to list Reagan first.In his first autobiography, Where's The Rest Of Me?, Reagan tells the story of Flynn's jealousy and attempts to upstage Reagan. Other people who worked with Flynn recounted similar stories, saying that Flynn, despite immense talent, frequently seemed lacking in confidence.Raymond Massey, as John Brown, is, as always, simply superb, and most of the rest of the players are good to excellent.One more flaw needs to be pointed out. Warner Brothers had a superlative stable of excellent actors, but, as in this film, the studio, possibly because of bad to mediocre writing, often wasted some of them in silly, stereotyped roles. For example, Guinn Williams and Alan Hale, eventually known as Alan Hale, Sr., have to make the best of two of their silliest roles, totally unnecessary sidekicks to Flynn and Reagan.Both are capable of handling even such silly roles, but it is a shame to waste them, and a shame to insult the audience, with such characterizations.

How in the world can the same people who put together some of the great classics be responsible for the near-clunkers just a year before or after? Santa Fe Trail has great themes--slavery, John Brown, and the coming Civil War--and it's not a bad film, surely, but it has some awkward moments, some filler, and is not half the movie it could have been. It seems almost to want to follow along the success of the great Civil War themes of two other recent successes, Jezebel (1938) and Gone with the Wind (1939), but it gets distracted by little bits of nonsense and some awful writing.Santa Fe Trail has the same director (Michael Curtiz) who would make Yankee Doodle Dandy and Casablanca two years later, the same leading actress (Olivia de Havilland) who had just finished an important role in Gone with the Wind and would win an Oscar for The Heiress later in the decade. There's music by the best in the business, Max Steiner, and photography by one of the best, Sol Polito. In fact, in the best scenes, like the night fighting halfway through, the photography is excellent and the music charges it up with good Steineresque excess.So what goes wrong? You might start what is called chemistry. The director is definitely to blame for not making the parts fit together in the first half, using lots of intertitles and chopping up the progress between fairly dull scenes (Curtiz had a famously up and down career). But other things must be at work that we can't see. The cast and crew and worked together, in parts ore in entirely, many times as part of the famous Warner Bros. family. Polito and Curtiz had just made other Westerns together, some with de Havilland. And the leading man Errol Flynn worked often with all three, including one of Curtiz's most famous films, The Adventures of Robin Hood. Of course, that one had Bette Davis, too.And this one has Ronald Reagan. (If you wonder if he can act this is bad place to start because he's an awkward, handsome dud.)The key problem here is something Curtiz should have controlled--the script. As a two sentence pitch to the producer it sounds great--the wild-eyed John Brown is on a violent anti-slavery crusade in Kansas and a group of young West Point graduates are sent there to bring order. The story is loaded with unnatural foresight about the coming war against slavery, and even the war against the Indians (because General Custer is one of these young military men). It's the story of John Brown, mostly, and yet this story gets watered down by a silly rivalry over de Havilland (Flynn vs. Reagan), and with a somewhat caricatured mercenary Northerner (played well by Van Heflin) who joins Brown on his rampage.At one point de Havilland, translating a fortune-telling Indian to all these men, says, Two of us are going to kill him, but none of us can stop him. And this is the best writing in the movie, bringing the themes to the front. It's about morality at the deepest level. It's about how wrong John Brown was, and how right. Turning it into a partly-joking, partly bitter and violent series of escapades doesn't do any of it justice. Including the movie itself.The last scenes are sort of epic and characteristic Curtiz, who could handle complicated movie-making like few others. His use of dramatic light, lots of foreground and background action at once, and moving camera are all put to use here. The terror of the God-crazed and righteous John Brown becomes central to the plot, and the famous battle at Harper's Ferry is depicted with a fury. The year is 1859 at this point, and what Harper's Ferry meant most of all was the inevitability of the Civil War, which started two years later. Some people give John Brown respect for being willing to cut through the pacifist chit-chat by politicians and get the things rolling. This is a small attempt to make it come alive on the screen.

Despite the 'Western'-sounding title, the comedy/drama actually involved a remarkable class of West Point cadets (who, in reality, were not classmates), and their ultimate pursuit of legendary abolitionist John Brown (portrayed, with fiery brilliance, by Raymond Massey, in the role that, next to Abraham Lincoln, he would be most famous for).Despite bringing back Flynn's resident film 'family' (Olivia de Havilland, Alan Hale, Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams), and adding Ronald Reagan, a rising star and friendly rival at Warner's, to the mix (the pair had terrific chemistry, and would reteam in 1942's DESPERATE JOURNEY), the atmosphere on the set was often tense, as Flynn despised director Michael Curtiz, the difficult taskmaster who had made the 31-year old Tasmanian actor a star, and he made it clear that he would NOT work with him, again. For his part, Curtiz considered Flynn a lazy carouser (which, in truth, he frequently was), and devoted more of his energy to the John Brown Kansas and Harper's Ferry sequences than to the romantic subplot of Flynn/de Havilland/Reagan, and the West Point storyline (creating, in effect, two films out of SANTA FE TRAIL, a light-hearted adventure, and a heavy, emotionally-charged drama). While the internal bickering did not hurt the film's box office (Flynn was at the peak of his career, and a guaranteed draw), it would mark the end of the Flynn/Curtiz collaborations.In the WB's effort not to offend markets in the North OR the South, history was reshuffled, and pro-slavery forces were shown as sympathetic (If the North would just give us time, we'd end slavery, ourselves). Attending the WB West Point Class of 1854 are future Confederate legends J.E.B. Stuart (Flynn), James Longstreet, and George Pickett (with Robert E. Lee commanding the Corps of Cadets, and Jefferson Davis the Secretary of War). Representing the North are George Armstrong Custer (Reagan, in the role Flynn would inherit in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON), Philip Sheridan, and James Hood. While everyone gets along, John Brown has placed an agitator in their midst (Van Heflin, early in his memorable career), whose attempts to disrupt the school would get him expelled. Tossed into the midst is the friendly rivalry between Stuart and Custer for the hand of 'Kit Carson' Halliday (de Havilland), although, considering the stars, it isn't difficult to see who she'd end up with! (Reagan would get young future star Susan Peters, here billed as 'Suzanne Carnahan', as his 'consolation prize'.)After a lengthy Graduation sequence (full of typical WB pomp and music), our heroes move to Kansas, confronting John Brown and his followers, who are conducting terrorist-like activities in attempting to free slaves. While Brown is full of fanatical, near-Biblical rage over the institution of slavery, his supporters are portrayed as narrow-minded thugs, making Flynn and Co.'s successes seem, if not morally right, totally acceptable. Eventually Brown and his forces flee to Harper's Ferry, where, after a fierce battle, Robert E. Lee, and the Union troops (including Flynn and Reagan), capture the zealot. The film concludes on a somber note, in a crucifixion-like setting, as Brown is hung, and the future Civil War adversaries acknowledge that the war is just beginning, not ending, with his death.While the film has been rightly criticized for it's point of view, and stereotypical presentation of slavery, these are more a product of the time the movie was made than a political statement. With WWII eminent, SANTA FE TRAIL was more a vindication of opposing individuals who would take 'innocent lives' than a treatise about enslavement. Entertainment was always the goal in Errol Flynn movies, not 'heavy' messages!Flynn would move on to his first 1941 release, the light comedy, FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK (again with Alan Hale, and his SEA HAWK co-star, Brenda Marshall); Reagan, to a few more 'B' movies, before achieving stardom in KING'S ROW; and de Havilland would join Jimmy Cagney and Rita Hayworth (and the busy Alan Hale, as well) in THE STRAWBERRY BLONDE...

It's impossible to enjoy this film historical accuracy aside, because it's so obviously pro-slavery. The fact is we are not talking about whether the Winchester repeating rifle was really invented by 1850. The abolitionists are painted as violent, crazy, murderous people, the reason why Kansas is called Bloody Kansas. Anyone who knows anything about this tragic period knows that pro-slavery forces were first to engage in murder and pillage. John Brown was notable because he was the first free-stater who started murdering back, and he made a campaign of it. After that, wholesale murder was found on both sides.  THAT is why they called it Bloody Kansas. What we see in the movie, however, is only John Brown's violence, time after time. We also see simple-minded black folks who would have been better off if John Brown hadn't made them free and responsible for feeding themselves. You can try and enjoy the story for itself, but the ugly and badly slanted arguments against abolitionists (and by extension against any reform of Jim Crow Laws in the 1940s) make it appalling viewing.

The movie is full of familiar faces, among them Alan Hale and Raymond Massey.  The latter is a dead ringer for John Brown and puts in a great performance as the unhinged radical. The plot is a little more interesting than the usual white hat-black hat western, with John Brown on his raids in Kansas and Virginia.  Still this movie is largely fiction--which is too bad since John Brown, a clearly unbalanced religious fanatic, is an interesting case study in early American terrorism; and which brings up issues related to the level of violence that is acceptable in fighting something one considers evil.  But again, this is a western, and political and social issues are largely absent--I think the deepest point the movie makes is that Custer and Stuart were brash young officers out to make names for themselves.

As entertainment, it provides an excellent mix of action, drama, humor, mesmerizing monologues by Raymond Massey(John Brown), romance with Olivia de Havilland, and patter within and between the buddy pairs of Errol Flynn(JEB Stuart) and Ronald Reagan(Custer), and Alan Hale and 'Big Boy' Williams.Van Heflin's purely fictional obnoxious character provides an additional element of conflict as a sinister devote of Brown, who proves to have more in common with Benedict Arnold, after not receiving his expected due share of glory and monetary reward for his contributions to the cause. His vengeful role of alerting Federal troops in Washington to Brown's current raid on the Harper's Ferry arsenal has no historical relevancy. Brown's actual force was much smaller than depicted, and mostly neutralized by local militia before Federal troops arrived.As others have abundantly detailed, there are numerous historical inaccuracies in the details in the story of Brown's quest to end slavery in the US, which is what this film is essentially about. Unfortunately, this was standard fare for most Hollywood films of this era. This film has received more than it's share of criticism in this regard because of the emotional central issue of slavery and because the gist of the story is widely known. For example, I don't see damning criticism of the highly distorted contrasts between historic kings Richard and John, in The Adventures of Robin Hood, because these distortions are not known by the American audiences and lack the emotional impact of Brown's story. Despite all the historical inaccuracies and distortions in details, I believe this film still captures the essence of the times, which is what historically-oriented films should attempt to do. This film clearly favors the view, articulated by Flynn, that slavery would have gradually disappeared from the South over time, without the necessity of southern secession or a bloody war. Clearly, this view offends many reviewers. However, without the ill-advised secession of the southern states as an unwarranted knee-jerk response to the election of Lincoln as president, this is what likely would have happened, despite the schemes of abolitionists. Savvy southern leaders, such as R.E. Lee, Jefferson Davis(both briefly included in the film), and Sam Houston, opposed secession as unwise, realizing that it failed to solve the problem of a lack of new territories for selling excess slaves, and risked widespread destruction by a stronger Union military response. Many reviewers are sarcastic about the convenient fictional West Point 'class of '54', which included a bunch of commonly recognized names in the future Civil War. Of those mentioned, only Flynn's JEB Stuart actually graduated that year. Seems like his buddy in the film should have been his Union counterpart in the war Phil Sheridan, who graduated the year before. Presumably, the much younger Custer was chosen because of his much more widely recognized name. In any case, the short-shorn Flynn and Reagan bore no physical resemblance to the normally long-haired or well-bearded historical personages. It's Massey's fervent portrayal of Brown that makes this film most memorable. This was the role of a lifetime for him. In some scenes, Brown is portrayed as a murdering madman. In other scenes, he seems the Christ-like messiah he fancies himself to be, thus providing a basis for either view. Brown's hanging is staged as resembling Christ's crucifixion on Calvary Hill, including his Christ-like speech.. Massey often played fanatics or villains, including Lincoln, who was fanatical about making the southern states rejoin the Union, at the cost of a long bloody war. Other memorable characters he played include the crooked salvager of sunken ship cargoes , in Reap the Wild Wind, and the slimy villains in the Scott western Carson City and the musical Desert Song.It's my contention that all 3 of Warner's Flynn-starring films released in 1940 have an intended subliminal message of presenting a strong united front against the very clear threat of a fascist-dominated Europe. This is most obvious in the Elizabethan sea war drama The Sea Hawk, in which the Spanish clearly are presented as analogous to the Nazis in their ambition to take out England as a rival. In Virginia City, near the end, Union and Confederate elements join together to fight off Bogart's bandidos, who want to steal the contested large gold shipment. This is followed by Flynn's eloquent Lincolnesk speech about binding the nation's wounds, after Lee's surrender. The present film features future Union and Confederate military leaders fighting together to suppress fanatical agitators who threaten to instigate a disunion of the states. also, I strongly suspect that Brown, as characterized, is actually a metaphor for the dangerous fanatical Hitler once a street agitator himself. As he is hanged, Lee remarks So perish all such foes of mankind. Going back a couple of years, we see a similar message in the replacement of Saxon-abusing acting -King John with the united ethnic policy of King Richard, in the Flynn-starring Adventures of Robin Hood.

Give me the money, he shouts, and I'll start a slave revolution in the upland South. He knows that country. It's filled with hiding places for guerrilla warriors. So he and his handful devoted followers take over the federal arsenal and settle down in Harper's Ferry, Virginia. The tiny town was, and is, a sinkhole at the confluence of two rivers. If you stand in the main street of Harper's Ferry and look in any direction, all you see are tall wooded hills looming over you. It's about the least defensible place on the planet.

And it IS a Western, though some scenes are set in the East. There is never any doubt who the good guys are. They're the ones who shoot their pistols jauntily, without aiming, and hit their targets. John Brown and his followers are bad guys, yes, but with mitigation, your Honor. His passion to free the slaves was all right, but his violent methods were all wrong. Every Western, though, must have a genuinely evil guy and in this case it's Van Heflin. His character seems lashed together in haste. At West Point, before he's thrown out, he reads treasonous literature to the other cadets and gets into fist fights (with Flynn!) over the issue of slavery. By the end, he's revealed as a craven money-grabber who only joined Brown's movement for the moolah, and when it's denied him he squeals on Brown to the government. That's known as discontinuity. I speak here not of historical inaccuracy but of dramatic clumsiness. God help me, my phraseology has been contaminated by listening to John Brown's dialog.You ought to see this movie if only for Raymond Massey's overblown portrait of John Brown. He never blinks. His eyes bulge -- and I swear I'm not making this up -- his eyes bulge until the dark irises are completely surrounded by white. I just tried it in the mirror and I can't even come close.There is an attempt at comedy. Its instruments are Alan Hale and Guinn Big Boy Williams. It fails dismally. Nothing they say or do would be funny to anyone with a sensibility quotient higher than that of a head of broccoli. The delightful Olivia de Havilland plays Kit Carson Halliday, the girl Flynn marries while rival Reagan stands by, shrugs good-naturedly, and smiles. The real Custer later married a smashing brunette named Libby, almost as attractive as de Havilland.It's a straightforward Warners production with Flynn, Reagan, Michael Curtiz, Max Steiner, Perc Westmore, and Sol Polito all hard at work in the factory, turning out their fast, unpretentious, actioners and dramas in their classic style.

We follow his romance with sweetheart Kit Carson Holliday, his friendship with George Armstrong Custer, and onto his battles with abolitionist John Brown.Tho it's mostly agreed these days that Santa Fe Trail has no great historical worth, it is however still a decent movie that boasts great drama, a sweet romance, and no little amount of action. Knowingly directed by the astute Michael Curtiz and featuring the acting of Errol Flynn (dashing as Stuart), Olivia de Havilland (gutsy as Carson), Ronald Reagan (solid as Custer), and Raymond Massey (acting overdrive as Brown), the picture certainly holds up well on the technical front.However, the relatively low rating on this particular site is of much interest to me , for being as I'm British I have no sort of conflict of interest with the actual story. Patriotic fervour booms out from the screen, but this appears to be at odds with the John Brown arc, the character's ambitions are nearly accepted as noble, creating a sort of odd coupling. I could of course be way off, but I wonder if the story doesn't sit well with some of our American friends? Still the picture is never less than enjoyable, the great music from Max Steiner adds to the occasion and the finale is high reward for the viewers patience. 6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Not as Much Fun as it Could of Been","Date":"7 July 2003","Score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":"  Santa Fe Trail is a film about history, that never happened.

They didn't give a damn about the true events that actually happened.If they did make the movie exactly how everything was portrayed on real life the film would of probably sucked more than it is now. This film is just not fun watching. The first half-hour is entertaining about Jeb Stuart and George Custard's friendship at West Point and their fight over Olivia de Havilland, but when the film focuses on John Brown and his problem about slaves, the film really runs off track. The pacing of the film is very uneven and it goes from comedy to drama and back and fourth. After a while it gets pretty boring. The characters that Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan, and Olivia de Havilland portray are likeable and Raymond Massey's portrayal of John Brown is superb and at times haunting, especially the close-ups of his face and those eyes of his. Errol and Ronald make a good team and it's a shame the two of them never appeared in another movie together again. Olivia de Havilland looks just as gorgeous in this film as her past films and even more beautiful when her hair is all down instead of bundled up. The action sequences of the film are at times entertaining and do get carried away, especially the sequence of Jeb escaping John Brown's lynch mop and taking cover in a barn where a massive shoot-out takes place. But in all the film disappoints rather than to entertain, and the subjects in the film are total B.S.

Though it has the usual Warner Bros. panache, and the action scenes are exciting and extremely well staged, it's done in by a script that, irregardless of its definitely racist overtones, just isn't very good to begin with; its Neanderthal attitudes about race just make it that much worse. The movie is rife with historical inaccuracies, but the film is based on an historical incident, not a recreation of one. Sure, the film would have been better if they had the real story of the pro- and anti-slavery battles in Kansas, or told the real story of John Brown, but you have to take this film for what it is--a vehicle for Errol Flynn. If you want a history lesson, turn on the Discovery Channel. Yes, the script demonizes John Brown and pretty much ignores any crimes of the pro-slavery forces, and deserves to be criticized for that, but it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. If anything, it's a good example of the attitudes toward race held by many people in America of the early 1940s, and not just Southerners of the pre-Civil War era.The film does tend to come to a grinding halt when things get preachy (it isn't entirely pro-slavery, after all). Ronald Reagan's character makes a somewhat surprising admonition to Flynn about how Brown's ideas are good and his philosophy is gaining adherents in the country (but when Flynn tells him that the South doesn't need a fanatic like Brown telling them what to do, Reagan relents and says, You're right, Jeb, I'm sorry. Ah, well, it was a start, anyway.)If you take this movie for what it is--a somewhat slow-moving, not particularly well written film salvaged by bursts of rousing action--it can be enjoyed on that level. Using modern social standards to judge a 1940s film about the 1850s serves no purpose other than to tick off the people doing it, and if that's what turns you on, so be it.

Massey's characterization of Brown is straight out of the famous Curry mural in Topeka, a wide-eyed and wild bearded zealot. I agree with some reviewers that slavery comes out pretty good in this film. At one point Flynn's Jeb Stuart character actually saves a slave family from Brown's clutches, and is thanked for it! This ambivalence towards slavery is certainly the hardest thing to stomach in this film. To think this film was made AFTER Hitler was on the march (at least in Poland) makes these sentiments all the more incredible. I saw this on TCM recently and the weekend host Mankiewicz posed the fanatical Brown character as a metaphor for Hitler, but I don't buy that. Abolitionists = Nazis?

Santa Fe Trail reads like history from Earth Q or somewhere and like the DC comics giving us a Clark Kent on two different earths and yet with similar if distinct histories, so the characters of this movie correspond to their historical counterparts to a greater or more frequently lesser extent. The historical errors are many and manifest Stuart and Custer in the same class, the railroad as well as myriad details, and yet..... There is some truth Stuart's speeches about southern attitudes are not entirely fiction; Brown's fanaticism and blood-thirstiness even if in the right cause; the young officers' mutual affection before the terrible events of the War Between the States. But the lack of flamboyance, of charisma in both Stuart and Custer, two men renowned even in their own lifetimes as too colourful and self-aggrandizing for words, is sorely missing in an oddly subdued Flynn (whose Robin Hood was probably closer to Stuart than this portrayal) and a competent but dull Reagan quite the opposite of the historical Custer. Not a great movie but one raised to iconic proportions by the work of Raymond Massey. Surely this was the role he was born to play sincerity raised to madness, devotion to fanaticism, rage bordering on divine justice. Is this movie as flawed by its racism as some would say? Perhaps, though I have seen much worse in other movies of the time. Like Birth of a Nation or Song of the South or even Gone With the Wind all viewers will read into The Santa Fe Trail their own personal biases. As one who grew up at the northern terminus of the Underground Railway and who almost made it to the South to ride the buses and support Dr King and yet who appreciates the mid-19th century southern arguments, I think this is a motion picture worth seeing and worth thinking about. In this pseudo-western story set on Earth Q, if we allow ourselves that degree of emotional distance, we might all learn something.

It has Custer graduating from West Point with some historical figures who graduated from West Point when Custer was 4 years old.  I cannot imagine why they rewrote history when they already had a fine plot, that of Jeb Stuart and John Brown.

Custer never met Jeb Stuart, yet this movie has the two of them best buddies and together capturing John Brown in 1859.I cannot recommend this movie because, if you know nothing of history you will come away from the movie believing outright lies, and if you do know something of history, you will be appalled.  I cannot imagine what the director and writers were thinking about, if they wanted Ronald Reagan in the movie so badly, they could have just made up a character and that would have been more believable.I am surprised they didn't have George Washington and Roy Rogers capturing John Brown.

Similarly, John Brown and his Freedom Fighters, libeled here in SANTA FE TRAIL, are largely responsible for Blacks being Free in America today. Without Brown, Abe Lincoln would NOT have been elected president, and NO Civil War would have been fought. (Robert E.

(Stuart was a firm believer in Millenia of genteel discussion among the lazy Plantation Owners.) SANTA FE TRAIL places Custer in the West Point Class of 1854, and asserts that he hails from the Buckeye State. Even Australian Flynn knew that George was a Michigan cadet from the class of 1862, so he insisted on playing Custer himself the following year in THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON to set the record straight. The latter flick includes Custer's oft-quoted line, Charge, you Wolverines! which initiated the defeat of Stuart's cavalry by Custer's horsemen, dooming Pickett's Charge, and the hopes of the South to persist in their evil Racist Slavery System. It's just so tragic that Flynn, by his birth, was ineligible to become U.S. President. If he had been a viable candidate, it's likely he would have taken better care of himself and been around to beat The Gipper once again in the 1980 election.

You also have to take the abolitionist/slaver narrative with an enormous grain of salt.

This time the story takes place in the years before the Civil War.The director takes advantage of this fact known to all (especially the American public) to establish a sort of mix between western and adventure film, drawing on the tensions between southerners and northerners in a group of soldiers at West Point. With historical characters from the secondary (names like Lee, Sheridan and Custer are well recognized among the spectators), the focus is on the real star of the film, Errol Flynn, who plays one of these soldiers (JEB Stuart), who are sent Fort Leavensworth to temper their spirits. Come just to meet the leader and fanatical abolitionist John Brown (Raymond Massey).The film works because of the presence of an ebullient and charismatic Errol Flynn, a pattern of action in which the romance (with the character of Olivia de Hallivand) fits in the most gentle and natural as possible, an evil bad guy and close madness, more appropriate use of the subject of abolitionism as internal source that separates men who despite their differences must obey orders and sense of duty that are assumed about the military. It is clear that the writers of the 40 knew how to tell interesting stories (even at the cost of distorting historical facts), and a director like Curtiz plasma with a steady hand, maintaining a sense of the show without losing sight of the star protagonist of film.Yet the film is surrounded by good supporting actors (Raymond Massey, Van Heflin, Ward Bond), even several years later became president of the USA Ronald Reegan), which complement the dual voltage know you want to show the director the most direct, external, the confrontation with Brown, and internal, between the military itself with which prefigures and present at all times remains the shadow of the future civil war. Therefore left in the final Curtiz feeling a bit strange, dark, since we all know that these promising young soldiers who are friends, end up facing each other despite their friendship.

Not the standard western story line or time setting, it takes place in the years immediately preceding the War Between the States. The action is not the usual cavalry versus Inidians or law versus outlaws, but the Army fighting against John Brown's depredations in bleeding Kansas. This first class A production put first-rate director Micheal Curtiz in charge of a cast topped by Errol Flynn, Ronald Regan, Olivia De Havilland, Raymond Massey (as John Brown), and Van Hefflin in a villainous role, along with Warner's terrific stable of supporting players, and hundreds of extras. Flynn is at his best here as gallant Army officer Jeb Stuart, and the trim Mexican War era uniform compliments his dashing image. Massey is overpowering and absolutely riveting as half-mad, fanatical abolitionist leader Brown. Miss De Havilland doesn't have one of her better parts as the love interest of both Flynn and Regan, but she makes the best of it and comes off both fetching and engaging. Regan is solid and likable in a second banana role. Flynn's two favorite sidekicks (and real-life drinking buddies), those crude but lovable buffoons Alan Hale and Guinn Big Boy Williams lead the supporting cast, which also includes Moroni Olsen (as Robert E. Lee), Henry O'Neill, and the ever-reliable John Litel. Acting is first rate from top to bottom.Santa Fe Trail is almost non-stop action from beginning to end, all of it well staged, well filmed, and driven along by a rousing Max Steiner score. This movie has so much kinetic energy, it reminded me of a silent picture at times. The night gunfight in and around the burning barn at Palmyra, which eventually turns into a full-scale pitched battle between the cavalry and the Brownites, is one of the most spectacular and exciting action sequences ever staged in a movie. Yet the script by Robert Buckner is intelligent with sharp and engaging dialog. The final battle with Brown's forces at the Harpers Ferry Arsenal is staged on an epic scale. In both this scene and the one at Palmyra it seems more like a war movie than a western.Santa Fe Trail is top-notch entertainment in every way. Unfortunately the picture has come under a barrage of unfair criticism from two of the most irritating creatures who lurk about IMDb -- the self-appointed history professor and the politically correct gestapo enforcer. The professors of course are right in saying the movie plays fast and loose with history. But who cares! This is a work of fiction, **based** on actual events but not bound to portray them with circumspect accuracy. When the facts get in the way of the story, the story comes first. Only the most naive and uneducated expect a movie to give accurate history. You have to go to one of those old artifacts of the pre-electronic age, a book, to get the facts. Santa Fe Trail does, however, give an excellent impressionistic view of the events and attitudes leading up to the Civil War. It should set off a looking-up binge for the curious. I recall when first seeing the picture about fifty years ago, I did a lot of looking up. I didn't expect to find Jeb Stuart and Custer in the same West Point class. I already knew enough to know that Custer was much younger. But I was pleasantly surprised to find Robert E. Lee and Jeb Stuart were in fact at the siege at Harpers Ferry. By the way some of the professors erred in complaining that lever action rifles were used -- meaning repeating rifles, which would be incorrect for the time period. The rifles used in Santa Fe Trail were Sharps single shot breech loaders, which employed an under lever to open and close the breech for reloading -- in wide use during the 1850's. Not everything was inaccurate!The politically correct thought-control police have labeled Santa Fe Trail racist simply because it tries to show both sides of the issue and because it portrays Brown as an unbalanced murderer, which no serious history denies, rather than the hero they horrifyingly think he was. They have been joined by the rabidly Southerner-hating Yankees who come out of the woodwork to comment on any Civil War era movie. In fact this movie takes no side. The movie studios of the Golden Era had no agenda, except entertaining people and making stacks of money doing it, which Santa Fe Trail delivered on both accounts. It wasn't taking the Southern side to have Jeb Stuart say the South would eventually take care of the slavery problem itself. That was a common Southern attitude. Because he said it doesn't mean it was true or the movie makers approved it. And on and on. What Santa Fe Trail failed to show about the era leading up the the War Between the States was the real cause of the war. It wasn't slavery, or saving the Union, or state's rights or Southern independence. Those were just excuses for fighting. The War happened because the people of the North and the people of the South hated each other's guts. Did then, did from the very beginning of the Republic, and still do! No, the movie Santa Fe Trail didn't show that, but the IMDb reviews and message board posts demonstrate it all too well.

First, the title has nothing to do with the story. Second, the politics are extremely murky, to the point of being deliberately obscure but still unmistakable and, to the modern eye, eyebrow-raising. Third, it features a strange meeting between two future US Presidents. It is perhaps the weirdest Western Hollywood ever made, but, unlike, say, 1970s Westerns that strove mightily to be revisionist and different, this one is unintentionally strange.Errol Flynn stars as JEB Stuart, part of a cadre of West Point graduates who (supposedly) were great friends but who later formed the military leaders of both sides of the Civil War. They politely spar over women, but not so politely against a messianic wild-eyed fanatic who is determined to upset everybody's comfortable life because of his obsession. That madman is one John Brown, who ultimately takes his fight from the wilds of Kansas to the neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The story ultimately devolves into a quite accurate depiction of the John Brown raid on Harper's Ferry and its resolution (Brown's hanging).Anyway, the only reason this film is titled Santa Fe Trail is because some of the events in the film take place near that trail's beginning. But that's not the oddest thing about it, not by far. This film takes the extremely politically incorrect position of making abolitionist Brown into the Osama bin Laden of his day and a group of (later Confederate) officers who captured him (Robert E. Lee, JEB Stuart) into the heroes. It doesn't come straight out in the open and say that the Civil War was a bad thing, but it comes darn close. One of the odder scenes is when a former slave tells Stuart, If this is freedom, I don't want it. Now, try putting THAT into a modern film. Well, you could try, I suppose....The strange sympathy shown for the South and its leaders and its cause isn't the end of the oddities, though. There is a bizarre scene where future General Custer, played by Ronald Reagan (one of Flynn's signature roles was Custer in They Died with their Boots On, adding to the confusion), dances with a pretty young lady and then is taken to meet her dad - future President Abraham Lincoln! They have a polite exchange, then Ron goes off to fight the evil guy who wants to free the slaves. So one actor playing a future President (this is set two years before Lincoln took office) has a strange and completely unnecessary scene with another actor who actually became President (forty years after this film was made). And the actor who played the strangely shaven Lincoln is completely uncredited anywhere, along with the daughter. Of course, Lincoln didn't even HAVE a daughter! It's all a bit odd and makes my head hurt. One of those strange moments in film history that nobody even noticed but is full of resonance now.Strange politics aside and oddities forgotten for the moment, this is a rousing war drama about some crucial events that otherwise are completely overlooked by Hollywood, probably because of the weird politics involved. The good guys later became the bad guys, and then revered figures in the history books, while the bad guy's cause was completely redeemed by history, so was he really a bad guy at all? Raymond Massey completely steals the film as Brown, playing the character as a complete and utter fanatic with delusions of Godhood and the air of a latter-day Moses freeing the slaves. One of the most mesmerizing performances I've ever seen.

ANSWER They're both all over the Map!","Date":"18 June 2008","Score":"3 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Biography, Drama","Review":" OMIGOSH! What a mixed bag this film is! You have to wonder just what they were thinking about over there at Warner Brothers when they planned this particular project.TO begin with, it is such a crossbreed of so many different kinds of movies. In essence it is part Action Film, War Movie, Biopic, Historical Drama, Western and even Period Piece. As is usual, if a film tries too hard to be too many things, chances are that it will do none of them well. Director Michael Curtiz and Company seem up to the task of making a better film, but never got a chance due to the script.AFTER a brief glimpse at the conditions in the Kansas Territory, with its lawless and brutal Guerilla Warfare between the Slavers and the Abolitionists, we are shown how one Cyrus Holliday (Henry O'Neill) plans to build a Railroad right through Bleeding Kansas; leading to the New Mexico. Hence we have the title, SANTA FE TRAIL. (Get it, Schultz?)THE opening then shifts locals and takes us to the United States Military Academy, at West Point, New York. It is the Spring of 1854, Commencement Time. The new class of Cadets are about to be graduated and infused as new blood into the U.S. Army WE are introduced to some of the members of the Graduating Class, such as J.E.B. Stuart (Errol Flynn), George Armstrong Custer (Dutch, himself, Ronald Reagan), Phillip Sheridan (David Bruce), George Pickett (William Marshall), James Longstreet (Frank Wilcox) and John Hood (George Haywood); great Civil War Generals on both the Union and the Confederacy.STOP! REALITY CHECK! I just cannot stand anymore! ALL of these future Generals are depicted as having been in the same Class, yet we know that there were some widely varying life spans involved. For example, we have George Custer (12/5/1839-6/25/1876), J.E.B. Stuart (2/6/1833-5/25/1864), Phil Sheridan (3/6/1831-8/5/1888), James Longstreet (1/8/1821-1/2/1904), George Pickett (1/16 or 25 or 31/1825-7/30/1875 and John Hood (6/1/1831-8/30/1879). The screenplay and scenario ignore these differences in age and the disparity in the true ranking of the men portrayed in real life.ADDED to the above bunch of Cadet characters is Bob Holliday (William Lundigan), son of Cyrus the Railroad Builder in Kansas and older brother of Kit Carson Holliday (Olivia de Havilland-Woo, woo,woo,woo!). The final character in the Cadets' Class and the first antagonist of the story is Carl Rader (Van Heflin). It is Cadet Rader who is the bad apple of the story; as he is an agent of the Abolitionist Party ; who is spreading propaganda in both the spoken and written word in the Military Academy.RADER has a particular dislike for Jeb Stuart and he is always in Stuart's face and constantly makes his general anti-slavery remarks personal to Cadet Stuart. Rader once even referred to Jeb as a Plutocrat, who has made a fortune on the backs of Black Slaves.* Rader and Stuart finally come to blows; as Stuart has tried tom ignore Rader's remarks; not wanting to jeopardize the graduation of any of himself or any other of his classmates. But finally, the situation just blew up.AS a result of the brawl, Cadets Stuart, Custer, Sheridan, Longstreet, Hood, Pickett and Holliday are called on the Carpet by the Commandant of West Point, Colonel Robert E. Lee (Moroni Olson) and, due to the circumstances, are spared expulsion; but are to be assigned to the most dangerous post on the Frontier, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas Territory.THE seven Cadets are elated at their assignment where they will surely see plenty of action and hence will have a head-start on their way to becoming generals.WHAT fate has in store for Rader will not be so kind. For his previous incidents of preaching Abolitionist politics at the Military Academy and because a large cache of Abolitionist pamphlets are found in Rader's quarters; Rader faces immediate expulsion and dishonorable discharge from the U.S. Army.LATER all meet up again in Kansas with the Cadets now 2nd Lieutenants and Rader a hired consultant to the seditious Abolitionist Leader, John Brown (Raymond Massey). Let's consider this last name in depth; for Mr. Raymond Massey gave a performance to end all others in his interpretation of the fanatical, self proclaimed spokesman for God on Earth. This is probably the most historically correct and hence most enlightening aspect of the story. Kansas was torn by a mini-Civil War of its own; a sort of 'Dress Rehearsal' for the big one, if you please.THE picture hits its climax with a highly fictionalized and fanciful depiction of John Brown's Raid and capture of the U.S. Armory at Harper's Ferry, Virginia ; which is now in the present day, in the State of West Virginia.TO their credit, the producers included in the cast plenty of regulars in Warner Brothers' stock company, people like Alan Hale, Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams, Joe Sawyer, John Litel, Russell Simpson, Charles Middleton, Susan Peters, Spencer Charters, etc., etc.AN interesting aspect of the film to me is the heavy handed and unsympathetic characterization of everyone involved with the Abolitionist movement and this dramatic license has a modern day equivalent; for it seems that most of our present day left leaning writers and liberal producers have equally vilified those in the Pro-Life, anti-abortion movement. Just look around on TV in our favourite dramas; try episodes of LAW & ORDER or PICKET FENCES (if its re-runs are showing anywhere).SANTA FE TRAIL would be okay as a strictly fictional work of make believe characters; much like that which was done in the Mel Gibson starring vehicle, THE PATRIOT (Columbia, 2000). As for a Period/Historical/Western/Action/Adventure/Biopic, we prefer THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON (Warner Brothers, 1941), which also has Miss Olivia de Havilland and Mr. Errol Flynn (this time, though, he's Custer!).

Still, I think it succeeds as being a well-made story about John Brown and his battles against eight future Civil War generals (Stuart, Custer, Sheridan, Pickett, Longstreet, Hood and their superiors here, Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis, who was also a Conderate general before he became CSA president.)Despite its horrible historicity and being poorly titled, with only about 60 percent of the film set in Kansas on or near the Santa Fe Trail, this film gave Ronald Reagan a chance to shine in only his third big-budget motion picture in a costarring role. His portrayal of Custer as a gung-ho warrior bursting with braggadocio captured the essence of what would prove to be a fatal flaw in his character. In fact, there's a telling scene in Custer's first battle, where he warns Stuart that they're outnumbered 3 to 1 and his buddy advises him If it makes you nervous, don't count 'em. That kind of advice must have have been offered to the real Custer before Little Big Horn. Ironically, Reagan gained fame playing another real historical character,Notre Dame football star George Gipp in KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American, which was released two months before SANTA FE TRAIL. The Gipper nickname from the earlier film, given to Reagan in later years, served him well in his final role, which he assumed forty years and one month after the SANTA FE TRAIL release. Putting history aside, which Hollywood films still do today, this movie contains some excellent acting by its principal players and is brimming with action, comedy and romance, while being genuinely serious about the issues it raises without becoming too boring, all the things that film-goers wanted then and want now, whether it cost a quarter in 1940 or most of a ten-dollar bill today.

In it, historical figures such as John Brown, JEB Stuart, George Custer, Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis are tossed together along with fictional characters to make a film that short on reality, but long on action and star power. Flynn plays Stuart, a gentlemanly southerner sent with several of his fellow recent West Point graduates to Kansas where Massey (as fanatical abolitionist Brown) is wreaking havoc in his quest to stir up a civil war. Reagan plays Custer (!) with his hair slightly lightened and de Havilland plays the sister of one of Flynn's cronies. Flynn and Reagan try desperately to gain her attention in between scuffles with Massey and his key henchman Heflin. Also along for the ride are Flynn cronies Hale, Williams, Lundigan and others who, over the years formed almost a cinematic repertory company of actors in his films. Flynn is his typically handsome and charming self, especially when vying for de Havilland at Reagan's expense. He's equally at home with the various battle and action scenes including a harrowing barn fire. De Havilland is lovely, most notably when she's stripped of her gowns and well-coiffed hairstyles and is just working with the men in a dusty skirt with smudges on her face (false eyelashes firmly in place!) Reagan tries to be charming, but can't hold a candle to the irresistible Flynn. He comes off as pretty dull. Massey gives an intense, virtually unblinking performance as the driven, single-minded, self-appointed emancipator of the slaves. Some of his long-winded speechifying is a little hard to contend with, but no one can say he doesn't immerse himself in the part. Heflin has a nice early role as a man who plays both sides to his own detriment. Hale and Williams add a nice touch of comic relief to the otherwise fairly serious goings on. The film lacks a definite point of view regarding its subject, but does provide a panorama of ideas and a surprising (for the time) amount of philosophy towards slavery and its ramifications. It's rather pointless to apply present day sensibilities and viewpoints to a film over 60 years old and expect it to line up with the opinions and beliefs that are popular now. At the time of it's release, it had only been 75 years since the war ended and, though the slaves were long freed, Black Americans were still enduring, legally and illegally, a multitude of social injustices. It's hardly possible to apply today's liberated mindset to a film made while segregation was in full swing. Also, anyone turning to any Hollywood movie for complete historical accuracy is barking up the wrong tree to begin with! Even now history is bent in the cinema, in virtually all cases, to make for more dramatic story lines. This film's primary goal is to entertain and, on that score, it succeeds heartily. Any meaningful message that can be learned from it, whether it was intentional or not, is gravy. In an odd coincidence (or was it homage?), de Havilland is courted by Flynn and Reagan on a train. Thirty-eight years later, she would sit in the same seat as Fred MacMurray and Ben Johnson squabbled over her in The Swarm. Sadly, that train derailed, killing all of them!

There have been many excellent biographies of Brown in the last couple of decades that are objective, fair and open-minded. If you are interested in the truth of the events so mangled in Santa Fe Trail, here are two books you could read To Purge This Land with Blood by Stephen B. Oates (1971), and Patriotic Treason by Evan Carton (2006). This movie portrays Brown as an evil fraud who is really an enemy of slaves. In reality, Brown remains the greatest white hero to African-Americans. Some pseudo-historians have called him the first terrorist. Terrorists kill innocent civilians massively and randomly. The five men executed by Brown's followers at Pottawatomie were carefully selected. They were participants in the pro-slavery terror in Kansas which had already resulted in the murder of six free-state men and in the sacking of Lawrence; they had declared war on the Browns and other abolitionists. The killing at Pottawatomie was a terrible deed, but a just reprisal in Brown's biblical view. And from a historical perspective, we may ask whether Americans have not always supported fighting back against terror and oppression. It always amazes me to hear John Brown's raid at Harpers Ferry denounced by the same Americans who glorify the colonial farmers who killed British soldiers on their way back from Concord. As if taxation without representation was in any way commensurate with slavery, one hour of which, in Jefferson's words, is fraught with more misery than ages of that which (the colonials) rose in rebellion to oppose.Of course I realize that for some people, standing up for the truth is just being PC.

Yes, Dodge City scenarist Robert Buckner has a number of real-life personages tangle with fictional villains. Some of the history is so incredible that naive audiences may howl at Buckner's audacity. For example, West Point did not graduate George Custer in 1854, so the film is rife with historical inaccuracies. Nevertheless, Santa Fe Trail is a thoroughly rousing western with well-staged shoot-outs, confrontations, and one of the nine outings where between Flynn and leading lady Olivia de Havilland were lovers.

That said, the historical inaccuracies of this movie far outweigh any good points that the film attempts to achieve. Errol Flynn's character (Jeb Stuart) is the worst offender of the bunch, and his dialog lines all but condone slavery and the coming Civil War. Playing his sidekick is Ronald Reagan as a very congenial and light-hearted George Armstrong Custer. If you can believe Reagan as Custer, you'll most likely believe the rest of the hokum and illogical circumstances of this movie. Standing out in all this bogus history is Raymond Massey as John Brown. In this film, Brown is merely a psychologically unbalanced maniac bent on destroying the Union unless he gets his way. The fact that Brown's real aim was to abolish slavery is glossed over with a few strokes from the brush of director Curtiz. Massey tries his best to bring some humanity to his role but the slanted script is stacked against him. Screenwriter Robert Buckner is probably most to blame for this white-washing of the truth, but he's not the only culprit. He's aided and abetted by all in this endeavor.Despite the dubious facts and distortions, Santa Fe Trail is still entertaining fare, mainly because of the presence of the great Errol Flynn. He may be mouthing a myriad of clichés, but he does so with conviction and a straight face. Olivia DeHavilland provides the love interest for her old buddy Flynn, and she looks great (as always). Stock company players Guinn Williams and Alan Hale accompany Flynn and provide some desperately needed comic relief. A young Van Heflin is also in the cast and has the unfortunate task of playing John Brown's cowardly and traitorous son. Of course, it's highly doubtful that Brown actually ever had a cowardly and traitorous son. The movie ends with John Brown being hanged by the authorities. He goes to his death willingly and without any histrionics. At least that much is historically accurate. It's too bad that everything that precedes that final scene is devoid of the true events in the life and death of John Brown.

At the time, Errol Flynn had also filmed The Sea Hawk, also under the direction of Michael Curtiz, so audiences were clearly able to see how Flynn could take on diverse roles. The film is set in the 1850's, and involve historic characters and events that trigger the Civil War (1861-1864). This include abolitionism, Southerners versus Northerners, Confederate President Jefferson Davis, General Custard and antebellum issues. Despite all this, the film is pure fiction. The title is misleading as this is not a Western though at times it can feel that way. Flynn plays Jeb Stuart, a Rebel soldier on a mission to capture the notorious and dangerous abolitionist John Brown (Raymond Massey). Long before he became President of the United States, Ronald Reagan was a film actor, although not a particularly good one. Here he plays George Armstrong Custer and this is possibly his best role, especially because it's not a leading part and he's not hamming it up. He is convincing in the role and his chemistry with Errol Flynn is terrific. Actress Olivia De Havilland chose to work on this film rather than The Sea Hawk because in this film, her character has more depth than the usual flat swashbuckler's love interest. She works very well with Flynn, seeing as how they have a history together since their famous collaboration Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). De Havilland was beginning to bloom as an actress. She had just finished Gone With The Wind and was on her way to winning two Oscars - To Each His Own (1946) and The Heiress (1949). Here she plays the vivacious and strong Kit Carson Holliday, named thus because her father hoped to have a son and gave her the name Kit anyways. She is resourceful, active and charming and for the part De Havilland changes her voice to suit the country dialect of the period. But perhaps the strongest performance is Raymond Massey as John Brown. While by today's standards, he is terribly Old Hollywood and melodramatic, he wholly convinces me as the intense, fanatical and zealous abolitionist, self-proclaimed prophet and somewhat of a cult leader. His physicality, faces and words bare a strange, perhaps even deliberate resemblance to Adolph Hitler who was the biggest public figure in the news as World War II began. Massey's acting reveals the director's wishes. We are not sympathetic of John Brown and his tragic end because his methods and means included mass murder and he seemed insanely consumed by his own legend. But we are aware that his intentions and ends are noble. He only wanted the slaves to be freed and for the South to mend its evil ways. This film is long and often talky, but it has plenty of action sequences and everything physical came easy to Errol Flynn but in this film he reveals more depth as an actor and he has never come off as more intelligent than in this film. He is even irrecognizable in a different role, which is completely devoid of the blatant heroism of his earlier films. Although not shot in Technicolor and the grainy, dull color may be a turn-off, it's a wonderful film and a classic slice of old Hollywood. Cinematographer Sol Polito also worked on Sea Hawk but the composer for this film was the great Max Steiner, who was very comfortable making music for epic films like this one. He had done the score to Gone With The Wind and was in great demand. Santa Fe Trail is a terrific film. Enjoy.

The other notables do a fine job. The script is completely racist.  It does a great job portraying John Brown as a fanatic, which he was.  However, it portrays anyone who shared his views (blacks are equal and slavery is wrong) as stupid, crazy, or violently insane.  Unless you happen to be very racist, you'll probably find that offensive.

Look at a photo of bin Laden while you watch Massey here - the resemblance is spooky!The righteous indignation of other reviewers at the pro-slavery bias of the movie misses the point. Santa Fe Trail is about fanaticism, not slavery. It's easy to preach to the choir, to put the fanatic on the wrong side. It's far more useful to put the fanatic on the side of right, as is done in Santa Fe Trail. The evil depicted here is not the easy evil of slavery, but the more problematic evil of fanaticism.The user score for this movie is due to the Political Correctness Brigade, who can't get past their sanctimony, to pay attention to the story and think rather than react. And by the way, Ronald Reagan (and I'm a Democrat) was a fine actor and did a good job in Santa Fe Trail, as did the rest of the cast. The most dangerous - and obnoxious - people are those convinced of their own virtue, be they Northern abolitionists, Southern racists, Muslim militants...or adolescents masquerading as movie critics.

But as an adequate depiction, or attempt at, historical fiction... well, not hardly. If you love a good western, love triangle, or Errol Flynn action epic, this is definitely the one to catch. As for the facts, well why bother. Being a Civil War buff, the extreme inaccuracies of the story line and fictionalized accounts of the principal characters was, for me, a major distraction. But as a film buff, hey what's not to like? Lots of action, great scenery, a handsome cast, and two zany, Shakespearean sidekicks.The biggest distraction for me was the grouping of West Point graduates. It is simply ludicrous beyond belief. For example, James Longstreet graduated from the Academy in 1842, John Hood and Phil Sheridan in 1853, J.E.B. Stuart in 1854, and George Armstrong Custer in 1861 (prematurely at that). Yet here they are all happy-go-lucky classmates sharing the same graduation class and thus assigned to Fort Leavenworth upon leaving West Point. In actuality, Custer was only 19 and still at West Point when John Brown was captured! This is not to say the depiction of commandant Colonel Robert E. Lee is not wonderful. It is. That of Secretray of War Jeff Davis is actually better! A blind hog finding an acorn, make that two acorns, maybe? In the film, the arsenal at Harpers Ferry is surrounded by mountains (a good thing), even if it is in no way surrounded by a town (not so good). And Brown's raid is staffed by about ten times the actual number that took the arsenal. Probably the saddest misrepresentation, however, is the lack of any black raiders, of which there were a few, including the first raider to have been killed.Yet this is still a very entertaining movie and one not to be missed by Flynn fans, Reagan worshipers, DeHavilland admirers (of which I am one), or John Brown worshipers (of which I am not). Where that train at the end is headed is anyone's guess since the track was probably not yet laid. But that's what Hollywood was about back then. Maybe the train was taking the crew back to L.A. "}]
