[{"Title":"Maybe 'Double Team' wasn't that bad in the end...","Date":"28 May 2001","Score":"33 out of 35 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Seeing a movie like Simon Sez is like going to the circus as a kid. For one and a half long hours you rub your eyes, not quite believing what you're seeing. It's amazing somehow, but you never quite believe it. Maybe that's not the best comparison, but can you tell me an event which makes you as speechless as such a movie?To call it a movie seems to be wrong anyway. It's a 90-minutes crazy, absolute over-the-top Rodman-thing with no sense at all.Usually I start with the story, but how could I do so with the total lack of one here? It pretends to be about some villain getting some kind of disc for some kind of weapon and to say this is more than you get from the film. Rodman plays a agent for Interpol it is said, although I'm not quite sure these are Interpol's working methods. Let's get this straight. Rodman is an agent in a french town with two monks as companions. They all live in a cellar under a church and have more crime to fight than the CIA in the whole US. Their gadgets include a CGI-fly, which can be directed in any direction and delivers an excellent view, a super-motorcycle which can drive up walls and ceilings and a lot of weapons.The two monks are obviously insane, as they sing and dance and laugh all the time very madly. One is fat, the other black. Your turn to make something of this.Rodman's other companion is another lunatic named Nick. He appears suddenly and stays without reason or explanation. Even more unreasonable is that Rodman lets him stay. Looking at this guy talking and 'acting' (sorry, but I got no other word for it), makes you wonder if there was a director who actually filmed him. In his first 10 minutes of screen time he impersonates three animals so unconvincingly and hilariously, that it's hard enough for itself. But seeing him 'doing the raptor' for about 30 seconds is just painful.There is also a woman which half of the movie fights against Rodman and the rest fights and sleeps with him at the same time. Where she comes from and who she remains a mystery.We also have a villain, so mad, it would be an understatement to call him a caricature. He always smiles, makes little jokes only he laughs about and gets scared the first time when his car is blocked by a sheep's herd. And he has maybe the first computer ever, which has not only a little animation looking like him, but this one can also talk for itself and change visually in order of the things happening around it. When the villain gets electrocuted, the animation gets to. Amazing.Which leaves us with a bunch of actors who laugh, dance and make crazy noises all the time, no story and the most unrealistic action sequences since Moses went through the Red Sea. Rodman lets himself fall down a long column, while he holds himself onto it with his legs, because he needs his arms for shooting. As I said, he also drives with his motorcycle up a wall and along the ceiling in a tunnel. And I can't forget the most hilarious sex-scene ever filmed, involving Rodman and his girlfriend/enemy, a strobo-light and a see-through bed.Movies like this leave me kind of exhausted. I'm a fan of bad movies, but bad movies are only enjoyable if they take themselves seriously. Simon Sez tries to be both a comedy and an action-flick and fails desperately at both. The classic bad movie Double Team was funny because van Damme was so damn serious all the time (not to mention Mickey Rourke). Rodman playing crazy was just an addition to the serious stuff and made this film perfectly bad. But here everybody just plays crazy. It's Batman & Robin mixed with Double Team on drugs. And when you succeed in watching the movie in full length without running away, you can be sure to feel as crazy as the whole crew must have felt to make this film. So, in a way you're get in contact with the filmmaker's emotions. There are just aren't enough emotional movies out there. Here's a new one. Who wants to cry anyway when you just as well can become crazy?

As soon as the movie had some action -- say, somebody jumped on a chair -- the cameramen went frantic. I kept vomiting during the car chase scenes, and that's pretty bad if you consider that they were driving at 10 mph with a bored frown on their faces.Then ugh... the acting. Not one performance even came close to being decent. The script... was there even a script? It looked like there was no story and they came up with (bad) ideas while shooting. And some scenes were so idiotic I wonder how a sane brain would came up with them. I mean, at one point Nick, the good friend of Simon Sez, has a gun in his hand, and loses it because he is making fun of the bad girl by playing a tyrannosaur. This is the kind of comedy that you don't laugh at because it's funny, you laugh at it because it's so unredeemable and idiotic you literally can't believe it.

Of course, Rodman is not the first person that comes to your mind when you're thinking action star, but thanks to the discreet (and sometimes not so discreet) use of wires, stunt doubles and rapid-fire editing, he almost pulls it off. But the show is stolen by a female martial arts expert, played by Swede Emma Sjoberg, who fights with style and confidence. Xin Xin Xiong, in the small role of the villain's No.1 henchman, also appears to be a good martial artist.

I could of done a better job and I've only taken one acting class.Minor Spoilers On the bright side, the 2 monks did help move the movie along. But at times their jokes began to wear thin. In addition, I liked the chick who was working against Rodman at the beginning but soon joined on his side. She spent half of the movie kicking Rodman's a** everytime she met up with him; that was enough for me to sit through this pitful excuse of a movie. Besides beating the crap out of Rodman, she did have some nice fight scenes with other characters in the movie (especially when she was fighting against Rodman and the bodygaurd to the villain in the movie). Another character that made this movie slighlty better was the boyfriend of the kidnapped girl. Sure, he looked like a pretty boy but he had some okay fight scenes. I kind of liked the bodyguard too. I gave him points for kicking Rodman's a**.The bad side to this movie is Rodman, of course, and the sidekick. What was the point of that guy? All he did throughout the whole movie was make lamb jokes and act stupid. I was glad when Rodman's enemy/girldfriend, in the movie, kicked him in the face and shut him up. In addition, the villain in this movie was lamb. Villains are suppose to be smart, charming, and kind of likeable. The villian in this turd was awful. Everytime he came on the screen I got a headache. The special effects were awful. The scene where Rodman rides his bike on the wall of a tunnel was so fake it wasn't funny. Also, the fight scene with the overweight monk was weak. A couple of times during the fight I could tell it was a thin guy padded down to look overweight.This movie would have been decent if Rodman wasn't in it, if the CGI was better, if it didn't try so hard to be funny, and if it had  focused on 3 of the characters in the movie (Rodman's enemy/love interest, the bodyguard, and pretty boy). The two guys who played the monks I have seen in other movies 10 times better than this. Hell, the Snoop Dog video that Taa-Dow (the black monk) was in looks like Oscar winning fare next to this dog.

Still, it must be said his performance here is WORLDS better than in Double Team, that classic of bad-moviedom. Perhaps because he's almost restrained, the makers of this have decided to bypass intelligent character or plot development (a fact given away by its grammar-savvy title) and packed it with common-denominator bits that are dime-store quality even by the action genre's sorry standards. And then there's the acting...Dane Clark, as Rodman's bumbling sidekick, pours it on thick with what is meant to be comic relief, but is neither comic nor relief; at NO MOMENT is he even BARELY amusing. If THAT were the very worst, it would be borderline tolerable, but oh no -- they've thrown in the comedy stylings of Ricky Harris & John Pinette as two computer-geek-slash-ass-kicking-slash -jive-slinging monks (monks!!!) who help and/or guide Rodman (it's never really explained); John Pinette is an embarassment not only to actors, but comedians, fat people, monks and especially himself 'fat' jokes are one thing but nearly every opportunity is taken -- with his blessing and help! -- to show him eating, or shaking his bountiful belly, or wanting to eat...until, of course, at the movie's climax, when he (or, rather, a stunt double) suddenly turns kick-boxing action star. Said scene provides the single most unintentionally funny moments try holding back the laughs when it's obvious Pinette's double is only about 6 inches taller and 100 pounds lighter (despite the padding), and watch as a baddie is kicked over a bridge and actually SLOWS as he falls, thanks not to slow-mo but to the bungie cord. Oh, and then there's the, ahem, special effects. Can you say blue screen? The only member of this cast (designed to appeal to every possible international audience) that shows signs of real energy is Emma Sjosberg, who shares a thankfully-brief love scene with Rodman (she kisses him on the lips and does NOT vomit.

And we've seen movies where the lead is opposed by an ex-love interest (Emma Sjoberg) and later they wind up back together.  I give it an '8' for being and doing what it was meant to be and do.

Simon Sez is such a movie; a film filmed, acted, directed, and written with such ineptitude, you'd swear that it was made by a bunch of dumb monkeys.  It's like the Dan Quayle of movies.Dennis Rodman stars as an ex-CIA, ex-secret agent, ex-everything it seems, who becomes embroiled in a convoluted kidnapping/extortion/hijacking/computer heist.  Give these villains credit where they are due; they do know how to multi-task.I don't really have anything against Dennis Rodman, but the man simply cannot act.  He wears one expression the entire time, bemused detachment.  It's the same whether he's fighting off an army of thugs, dealing with his army of sidekicks, or riding his spiffy yellow motorcycle.  Every single thing that he encounters causes him to smirk.  I was waiting for someone to shoot him in the foot and have him smirk.  Sadly that moment never came.I mentioned his army of sidekicks; and there really are a ridiculous number of them, and they all are complete idiots.  First there are the two Monks, Micro and Macro, who help Dennis in his quest for whatever it is he's looking for.  These guys live in a church, dress like monks, have the monk hair, but have a high tech lair filled with sophisticated equipment and post-it notes (I called it the Rodcave).  I thought something about them was fishy; were they real monks or not?  Then later I was informed that monks take a vow of silence, and these gents certainly don't uphold that vow.  And did I mention one of them is really fat?  And he does kung fu?  No, really, he is.  And he does.  I didn't say he does it well though.Then there is the generic looking whiteboy sidekick, who is a stand-up comedian I've seen on a few talk shows (and who has not impressed me).  He's some sort of ex-agent, who knows from where, and he's the most incompetent idiot this side of, well, those two monks.  He does both a raptor impression and a dog impression, and fights like his life depended on his gruesome death.There's plenty more to mention here, like Simon's ex girlfriend who alternates fighting and stripping with him; the car that tilts on two wheels, but doesn't fall over; the laughable wire stunts; the bizarre tendency for almost every character to have a nondescript accent; and my personal favorite, the pole sliding scene.  Trust me, when you see it you'll know.I haven't enjoyed a bad movie this much in a long time.  Thanks to plenty of poorly made mindless violence the film rarely drags despite its stupidity.  The laughable dialogue also helps this clunker speed along towards its action packed finale.  For fans of the bizarre and big rebounding NBA forwards turned film stars.

This Dennis Rodman's movie deserve to be buried. Don't get me wrong, Dennis Rodman was an alright basketball player, known for his fierce defensive and rebounding abilities, but he should have never reach the level of popularity that he got in the 90s. He was a nightmare, most of the time. He became notorious for numerous controversial antics. I'm not talking about his repeatedly dyed his hair in artificial colors, piercing or tattoos, I'm talking about his regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials, missing practice, and being a total ass. I guess, this 'Bad Boy' persona work for him, and he turn to films to launch him, even further. Dennis Rodman is not the worst athlete turn actor, I ever saw, surprising, but he's clearly not anywhere near the best like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. There has only been one awesome tattoo cover, multi-color hair, black man named Simon and that's Simon Phoenix (Wesley Snipes) from the movie, 1993's Demolition Man. Sadly, this movie actor is not in that level. Directed by Kevin Elders, Simon Sez tells the story of Interpol agent Simon (Dennis Rodman) whom job is it, to gather up information about the weapons trade on the French Riviera and trying to pinpoint the man at its center. Meanwhile, Nick Miranda (Dane Cook) -- an old classmate of Simon's -- asks him for help. Nick needs to rescue his employer's daughter, Claire Fence (Natalia Cigliuti) who appears to have been kidnapped by the same people that Simon is tracking down. The pair must get to the bottom of the increasingly dangerous situation with the help of two cyber monks Micro (John Pinette) & Macro (Ricky Harris) and a feisty woman (Emma Wiklund), to rescue the woman and save the day. While, the movie can be funny with it's over the top action, the supporting comedy relief characters are just unwatchable and unfunny. I really can't stand Dane Cook with the annoying over-used animal impressions. He's overstay his welcome with the bed humping scene. Others characters that I hate, are the Cyber Monks. They should never be in an action scene, nor should they ever dance again. How come, they're not the same cyber monks from 1997's Double Team if this movie is supposed to be a spin-off? Honestly, those monks were kinda cool. Still, it seems like much more than mere coincidence that Dennis Rodman starred in two movies that feature Cyber Monks. Honestly, whom idea was it to have Cyber Monks in the first place? Those monks look like Franciscan friars, judging by their robes. Franciscan friars aren't adverse to most aspects of modernity. What's next? Virtual Amish!? It's seem really a bit of contradicted to practice their religion. Anyways, these Cyber Monks, in this film are just lame and obnoxious as hell. I can do without all the fat 'Free Willy' jokes. Even the villain, Ashton (J√©r√¥me Pradon) hams it up. He's so cartoony in his line delivery. Clayton Day as Claire's father, William Fence looks like Robert Redford. I saw that some people mistake it for him, at the time. I really did mistake him for Redford, at the time, as well. Sadly, the movie has no season good acting. All of them were pretty mediocre. This movie is so over the top schlock, anyways. The poor literacy misspell title is lame attempt to look cool. Sez? What's does Special economic zone have to do with Simon? The half-baked plot is just as generic as other B-list action films of the time with a lot of kidnapping and looking for a disk to take over the world. There is a lots of filler scenes just to increase the run time with pointless fight scenes and stunts. Lots of awful wire-works action, with poor-time jumps and kicks. The movie suffer from poor action/reaction cutting. The impact gets completely lost. There is also a lot of fights goofs that they left in. The late 90s CGI special effects in this film are very fake looking. Scenes like the tunnel or the robot bee look so phony. Even the explosion look pretty scale down, when badly done models blow up or actors walking around in clearly no hidden blue screens. Another headache scene is the strobe light sex scene with Dennis Rodman and Emma Wilklund. I felt like I was having a seizure, watching it. Overall it's a really bad spy movie that put too much campy spy clich√©s in it. If you're a fan of stupid movies. Then, watch it. It does have some it's so bad, it's good moments. If you know what you're getting into, turn off your brain, sit back and enjoy it. If you're very smart. Avoid it at all cost. Trust me, I wish I didn't see this film.

For instance, at the end of First Wives Club count how many different pairs of shoes Goldie Hawn is wearing in the last seen. I counted four different pairs. In this movie, can you count how many times Rodman's bike changes in a single scene. We counted four in the the first scene of the movie, an three in the scene where he is escaping the blast in the tunnel.

Michael Jordan bombed with critics in Space Jam, and Shaquille O'Neal flopped in Kazzam and Steel. But nowhere is this theory supported majorly than in Simon Sez.This is an action comedy that serves as the second major acting credit for former Chicago Bulls player Dennis Rodman. His prior appearance was in 1997's Double Team, alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme. For a terrible action flick, it did get points for a climactic coliseum showdown, complete with Coca-Cola product placements. You're better off watching that again than this movie, in which an Interpol agent named Simon (Rodman) is given an assignment to rescue a close friend's daughter, Claire Fence (Natalia Cigliuti). Assisting him in his quest are two cyber monks and his sidekick Nick Miranda (Dane Cook).Dennis Rodman's acting is just like what we've seen from him in Double Team. In other words, it's another acting attempt by an NBA superstar. To his credit, though, he's actually the best actor in this movie. Now, it's not signaling a good performance, but it's a huge compliment in comparison to his co-star, Dane Cook. With Simon Sez as the second movie he's ever done, Dane Cook is best known as a stand-up comedian who's had more acting credits than his co-stars overall. Now, he's way better as a stand-up comedian than he is an actor. He did have some good movies like Horton Hears a Who and Dan in Real Life. However, he is totally obnoxious in this movie. His idiotic comic relief character even makes Dennis Rodman look like Marlon Brando. There are more terrible comedy acting where that came from. There's also Micro (John Pinette) and Macro (Ricky Harris) as the two cyber monks, which is actually defined in Webster's as unfunny computer nerds that spend too much time playing Dungeons & Dragons in their mom's basement. These comedic characters are all written in the most unnatural way possible. They're not just bad. They're annoyingly bad.This is an action comedy that heavily borrows from better films like 48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop and Rush Hour, except in an agent theme. It also tries to come off as an action film when it completely feels like a comedy film. And when the plot and action kicks in, the movie suddenly goes on autopilot. They make the storyline and development so uninteresting, that it's not even on the same level as the awfulness in the first act. Although, you probably stopped caring about this movie after you're introduced to Cook, Pinette and Harris.In terms of action comedy, Simon Sez is sterile and boring as an action flick and even worse as a comedy. Dennis Rodman gives a better acting performance than he does in Double Team. Yet overall, Simon Sez is not only the worst movie to star an NBA player, but it's also bar none the worst movie to come out of the 1990s.Score 0/100Recommendation None "},{"Title":"If you drink enough rum it's funny","Date":"25 December 2014","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" There was nothing on TV that I hadn't seen 1000 times already and had a good buzz on so I said what the F check it out. it's absolutely terrible but with a buzz you can laugh your ass off at how bad it is.

Confusing?Dane Cook pops up, and I can tolerate this guy post 2007, but in this, he is the pits, a truly awful comic presence, with no timing, and an air of desperation around him, trying to be the next Jim Carrey.Action scenes are boring, and add a really strange sex scene, that will baffle,you get a really strange, but not boring, movie.Elders has either made a misunderstood work of art, or yet another vehicle for a has been sports star who was famous once.I'd go or the latter.

It is glorious in all its cheesiness. The one thing that brings it down (and I admit it's a rather big one) is Dane Cook who very nearly ruins a perfectly good corny action movie. His character enters the film around ten minutes in and after a further seven minutes I was already tired of his animal impressions and other shenanigans. His brand of humor is simply loathsome. Other than that, Simon Sez ticks just abut every box on the guilty pleasures action movie checklist; let's recap. There is a motorcycle gang doing unnecessary stunts, an over the top villain, dancing cyber monks, a not so secret secret agent in yellow motorcycle gear and a woman who likes to spontaneously fight/have sex with the protagonist. This is by no means a good movie but it definitely fits into the so-bad-it's-good category.

This movie is #1 on my list of worst movies ever made that are great fun to watch I was highly entertained at the horrible acting, silly plot...er was there one? and the two monks. I mean come on...monk side-kicks? It's just over the top. This movie tries to be a comedy and an action flick all at once..the comedy failing so miserably that it is incredibly funny. This will be one of those bad movies that you will truly love because it is so bad, or some will find it just not quite bad enough. I would compare it to Arnold's Total Recall. A bad movie with bad jokes, bad action but FUN.

Dane Cook is the least funny comedian ever. I put comedian in quotes like that because I don't really think he is a comedian at all. Just like I would say Dane Cook is not an actor but an actor. He is a comedian and an actor. His stand-up comedy is horrible. His acting in this movie is at least as bad as Dennis Rodman's, and that is saying something I am sure you will agree if you have ever seen Dennis Rodman's acting. Dennis Rodman is probably as good at doing standup comedy as Dane Cook is at acting. This movie is awful. They couldn't even spell the title right. Simon Says this movie is one of the worst ever. "},{"Title":"Simon Sez","Date":"3 May 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" This is one of those movies where there is a minimum of one fight or chase scene every ten minutes, and if not for that there's no reason for the movie to exist. Rodman plays Simon, the man whose sezing is responsible for our title. Rodman is a secret agent for INTERPOL who has no less than TWO comedic sidekicks constantly dressed as monks in their monastery base in France. Simon is a motorcycle riding, kickboxing super agent capable of sliding down columns with his legs so that he can shoot guns with his hands. INTERPOL is apparently one of the easiest to work for secret agencies, because Rodman apparently has no mission or assignment to work on until an old schoolmate played by stand-up comedian Dane Cook, because apparently this film needs a THIRD comedic sidekick. Dane Cook is on a mission to exchange confidential military secrets for his boss's kidnapped daughter, and he brings Rodman along for the ride. The exchange goes bad and Rodman takes charge as any good action-hero does, and together Rodman and the trio of comic relievers try to track down the kidnapped girl and the most ridiculous villain since the Number 23 played itself in the Number 23.Dane Cook manages to work in his impersonations of dogs, dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, and Chewbacca into the first twenty minutes. Remarkably none of the bits that may very well have worked on stage fit into the movie and, furthermore, since they all sound virtually identical, really come off as lame. The only difference between Cook's dinosaur and Chewbacca is that dinosaurs have tiny arms. Apparently someone thought animal noises and kickboxing equaled box-office gold; of course, if that were true, Jean-Claude Van Damme's puppet show in Branson would be a bigger draw than it is now. Although to his credit Cook gives up on his impressions, one of Rodman's sidekicks (John Pinette) does a similar whale impression, which at least is tenuously related to the film because he is fat. Hilarious, no? About 1 out of 10 of Dane Cook's lines are amusing, but since 10 out of 10 are supposed to be funny, that's not a very good batting average. During a car chase where Rodman and Cook are being chased by the bad guys, and Rodman TWICE drives for an extended distance while tilted on two tires, Cook quips, These guys are like my college loan officers, they just keep coming! There is nothing better in a cheesy action movie than a scenery-chewing villain. This is the one role where it not only acceptable to overact, it is in fact mandatory by Hollywood law. When done right, the actor who hams it up as the villain can steal a movie, as proved by the likes of Robert Patrick in the horrible WWE Films The Marine or Christopher Walken in The Rundown. Our villain Ashton is doing an effeminate, impish supervillain that's so bad he'd be more suitable to battle Pee Wee Herman than James Bond. This is the kind of villain who while menacing a colonel he's extorting says, Colonel, do us all a favor and turn that frown upside down. My favorite is this exchange between Rodman and AshtonAshton Guess what we're going to blow up first! Rodman Your ego? Ashton No, but nice try, sailor! The Eiffel Tower! Rodman Why? Ashton Because it's big and it's delicious and I'm tired of looking at it!Like any other action star, Rodman gets to dive from a building before it explodes, then walk in slow motion away from the same building as it burns. Just like a real action hero! And as he emerges, his cohorts actually say, That's our Simon! Which, if you think about it, is really dialogue more suited for a wacky, 50s sitcom rather than a cheesy, 90s action flick, but that's just my (correct) opinion.While I've never seen more than short clips of Cook's comedy act and none of his recent starring vehicles, I think he at least adds a certain charm to the film. Rodman doesn't fare so well, though the ridiculous script certainly is of no help. It ain't over, Rodman growls with what is meant to be intensity. The man really doesn't possess any kind of charisma as far as I can detect. Beyond being a very good basketball player, the only reason that Rodman is famous is due to his outrageous publicity stunts like wearing a wedding dress to a book signing or wrestling in a tag team with Hulk Hogan and thereby degrading brides, books, and professional wrestling (which is hard to do).Unless you love bad action movies as much as I do, you should stay away from this at all costs. But I do love bad action movies as much as I do, and this is so bad it's actually entertaining.DJR - For more of my reviews check out film.ispwn.com "},{"Title":"Wasted Talent Party of One","Date":"15 April 2006","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Overall, the acting is poor, the script is worse, and the stuntman would have done better to not have had a bungee cord attached when jumping off the bridge. However, there is a bit of this movie that critics tend to overlook.Where the rest of the acting is shabby and forced, Jerome Pradon (Ashton) comes out on top. Though he's been given a poorly developed character and a worse script to read from, Pradon rises from the proverbial ashes that is Simon Sez. Overlooking anything that has to do with anyone else involved in making this horrific movie Pradon's acting is as brilliant as can make do.Bottom line? I would suggest this movie if you are a Pradon fan...otherwise -go take the dog for a walk...or something.

NBA player Dennis Rodman plays the charismatic yet notorious Simon alongside and incredible young cast including Saved by the Bell's Natalia Cigliuti playing the sexy and seductive Claire.

Well, I cannot imagine that filmmakers are any different and, as such, Simon Sez must have been one of the films where, eventually, everyone was just clocking in to get the job done, without any allusions about what a terrible piece of junk they were involved in. It is not any one thing about it that makes it terrible so much as, well, everything. The plotting is pretty poor to being with in general sweep down to the detail. Well, actually that is not fair because I suppose the overall kidnap plot could MAYBE have been turned into something good if every aspect of it was not so badly done. It isn't just the silly cars with parachutes built into them, or the stupid fight scenes but just how generally incoherent and cheap the whole mess feels.This feeds over into the characters which are either lazy clich√©s delivered in basic terms or, worse, embarrassing comedy characters that are as funny as being on fire. Of course we have all see bad films which are enjoyable because the action scenes work in big fun ways and I guess Simon Sez was never going to produce tension so this was the way to go. However it is never fun and instead the action sequences just feel so incredibly poor, like director Elders just thought pointing the camera at people firing guns or jumping around would be enough, which it isn't. The cast are perfect for this and they are roundly terrible. Rodman is a massive stiff board of a man without any of the fluid movement he showed in the NBA at his best and certainly none of the passion &#150; he is the charisma version of dark matter. Dane Cook is worse though because he tries really hard. Now, I kinda like his goofy performances in other things but here he is given sh1t to work with and he performs accordingly with an unfunny and irritating character &#150; his get prehistoric doesn't get shaken from the memory easily either it is so bad. None of the rest of the cast can do anything but one does have to give special mention to the unimaginative comedy monks who are painfully unfunny (Pinette and Harris) and the effete bad guy who is useless as a central villain.Simon Sez is a terrible film. It is not even a bad film with a bit of fun or action about it because the cheap and nasty production standards and poor ideas conspire to leave anything of value on the screen at any point. Those picking on Rodman as if it is all his fault are missing the point &#150; everyone is to blame here because nothing about it is good. Not the direction, the scoring, the stunts (terrible wire-work), the acting, the dialogue, the story &#150; nothing. It is a terrible waste of space whose only memorable thing is just how insulting to the viewer it is.

Now that would be realistic, sure... that would also be BORING.Simon Sez, on the other hand has some slick production values, lots of mindless action, nothing nearing a cohesive plot, it has zero character development, doesn't have a shred of realism and certainly nothing that approaches method acting... in short it's everything a fun action movie should be. The action scenes range from the good IL' gun fights to bike stunts to the mandatory explosion in the climax(though that could have done with some better CGI)...and where the action does let up, the comedy more than makes up for it. The scenes between the monks & Nick(Cook) are especially hilarious; check out the 'running man' scene to see what I mean.I remember reading somewhere that when it comes to Mr.Rodman, there are no fence straddlers...you either like him or you don't. Obviously the former don't go in too much for reviewing movies ,because a more than decent movie seems to have suffered from the lack of general bonhomie generated by its lead actor. A pity, since it is a great actioner and even manages to be consistently funny... and though 'Simon Sez' is unlikely to propel its lead stars towards any acting hall of fame, to be fair to Rodman & Cook, they've done the best with the cards that they've been dealt, talent & script wise.In the end not a bad movie at all.

This film is horrible...no question about it. The only question is does it belong on IMDb's Bottom 100 list?. Well, I'd say no...but its inclusion doesn't bother me as it is a terrible film with very little to recommend it and it is so incredibly irritating. One one hand, the stunts took considerable talent but on the other hand this is mindless trash through and through.For the most part, the biggest problem was NOT its star Dennis Rodman. He wasn't particularly good, but he wasn't terrible. Yes, he had practically the personality of sawdust, but in this film that's a relatively good thing! That's because at least he wasn't an irritant--like his co-stars. Dane Cook, on the other hand, was about as welcome as cancer in this film. This annoying troll managed to be more obnoxious and unfunny than folks like Chris Tucker or Uncle Joey from Full House--now THAT'S bad! Nearly every second Cook was in the film I hated him and wanted his character to die. He was loud, he was unfunny and he made goofy sounds and acted like a dinosaur at one point for no reason whatsoever. The only good thing about this is that his obnoxiousness overshadowed the few times that the normally funny John Pinette was also obnoxious and unfunny. I have never seen a cast of sidekicks less funny or welcome than these trolls! In addition to totally unfunny comic relief, the film suffers from the notion that the only way to hide the fact that Rodman is no actor is to throw over the top stunt after over the top stunt into the film--sort of like 4 or 5 James Bond movies' worth all shoved into one film. Believe it or not, the stunts here are even more ridiculous than those in Mission Impossible--another movie designed for brain-dead audiences who hate plots and only want non-stop action.Normally, I would try to explain the plot and tell you more about the film but I'd rather not and just scream loudly THIS FILM IS HORRIBLE--AVOID IT LIKE EBOLA!!!!.
