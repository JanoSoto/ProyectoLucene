When he gets to the diner where Amy is supposed to be calling for a tow truck, she is not there. Where is Amy? Where is the trucker who helped her? Why are people shooting at Jeff?

Why? Because the characters choose appropriate actions based on their motives. Here's a few examples(Spoilers ahead)When Kurt Russell confronts the guy in the truck at the gas station in the very beginning, and his wife asks him what who he was, in a bad movie he would have said no one. Here he explains that it was the same guy from before, which makes sense.It doesn't make sense at first when Russell refuses the ride from the trucker, but it is subtly revealed that he doesn't want to leave his car alone. This leads to his wife going off alone, but only after she forces the issue. Russell's motivations here make perfect sense for his actions. After Russell tapes up the bad guy and is pulled over by the cop, in a bad movie he would have put his gun in the cop's face and tied him up too. Instead, he surrendered and asked for help, just like a reasonable person would. When Russell latches onto the back of JT Walsh's truck, there's a dramatic sequence where he clings to the bottom of the truck as he makes his way to the front. In a bad movie, this would have led to him climbing into the cab, wresting control of the truck and forcing Walsh to reveal the location of his wife. Instead, he was taking the sensible and important step of getting to a safe and comfortable place to spend the hours-long ride. Throughout the movie, Russell tries to call for help. In most movies like this, if an attempt is even made to actually use the police, they are invariably disdainful of strangers, in on it, or both. In the brief period where Russell thinks the cops are in on it, he tries to reach an FBI agent. Apart from the period immediately after the cop got shot, he constantly tries to get police help, just like a thinking human being would.These and many other small things are examples of the screenwriters giving characters reasonable motives in unreasonable situations and allowing the action to unfold. In too many action movies the main character forces the plot with completely irrational behavior. The main character here reacts to the plot evenly with the audience, and it makes him a much more sympathetic hero than the typical action movie.

Happily chatting along the way, they run into a small 'snag' their vehicle, has a break down. Over heating and somewhat confused by the incident, Jeff and Amy push the vehicle off the road and collect their wits, trying to figure out a workable plan that will keep them moving and allow them to split up to get two things done and save a lot of after hassles. A Peterbuilt semi truck pulls up behind and then over, a kindly middle aged 'good' Samaritan driver asks if they need assistance? Sure enough, the vehicle has overheated and they need to make it into the next town...one of them, the other staying with the vehicle, so nothing will happened to it. What happens next is terrifying. People, trusting others to help-out in time of need, run desperately amok. Disasterously Jeff makes it into town to find that his lovely little wife, somehow, never arrived?! Kurt Russell is and brings out an award winning performance of a man in terror. As he is back on the road, he sees the kindly old driver who assisted he and his wife! Jeff pulls up beside 'Red' on the highway motioning Red to pull over and Red just looks at him as if he is stranger. Jeff calls in the local Police, though all the while interred into the problem and sympathetic, nothing gets changed, because Red acts as though he has never seen Jeff and tells the officer the same thing. Jeff is emotionally upside down now!! He feels alone and out numbered by professional kidnappers. As he is moving along, he is contacted. Pursued by a big man named Earl, who ends up being the go-between for the ransom and the party that has mysteriously 'snatched' his woman. Jeff is now insulted, by the transfer and subsequent abduction of himself by the collector, that something inside Jeff that probably has never been used, breaks down. Jeff Taylor is now on the other side of the law, he is just trying to survive In this game. Russell excels as Jeff Taylor and Kathleen ain't far behind in this who dun-nit, thriller-roller-coaster ride. The late J.T. Walsch is the front-man screw-setter for the other part of the gang that will turn the screws harder to Jeff and Amy.This one deserves ten of ten for an exhaustingly great mix of emotion, fear, aggressive action and anger, that will set the movie goer on the edge of the seat!

That was the comment I made after watching 1997s summer sleeper Breakdown.  This is the kind of movie that works so well and moves so fast that despite moments of plausibility, it won't give you time to think or even care about such things.     In the beginning we see a happily married couple Jeff & Amy Taylor (played to the cue by Kurt Russell & Kathleen Quinlan)hitting the open road.  After leaving a gas station (where I will never leave the hood of my car propped up again) their Jeep Cherokee breaks down and do the the fact that they are in the middle of nowhere their cell phones are out of range to call for help.     Coincidently, (perhaps)? a trucker named 'Red' (the late and very talented J.T. Walsh) happen to drive by to offer assistance and Jeff (in his one weak moment but nobody's perfect) agrees to let his wife hitch a ride to the nearest town while he waits behind.     Tick tock, tick tock.  Time starts to get the best of Jeff and in a state of mild panic he inspects the SUV and discovers a few loosened wires which turns out to be the reason the Jeep stalled, and then yep, it's now running like a dream. (I was expecting something like that since it's doubtful the makers of Jeep Cherokee would allow anything else).     Now things are getting bad. Jeff arrives in town only to discover that Amy never arrived and nobody has scene a thing. While in the restaurant one drunk suggests he checks the ladies room so Jeff does but only to discover a woman vomiting in the toilet.    The plot takes an interesting turn when Jeff spots Red speeding down the freeway and though he successfully pulls him over expecting to find Amy Barr's reply is I'm sorry, but I've never seen you before in my life.  The police arrive at the scene and are sympathetic, but can't offer any real assistance without proof.      What works so well in Breakdown is writer/director Jonathan Mostow has made a movie that is not only exciting and thrilling but SMART TOO.  Like a lot of movies, the good guy tends to do so many stupid and unmotivated things (see Jurassic Park 3 for proof) that eventually I start rooting for the bad guy.  I also liked Russell's character Jeff a lot and admired his determination on not giving up to rescue Amy. And the final chase sequence is the best I've seen since Steve McQueens brilliant film, 'Bullitt.     Jolly good show Jonathan.

His film has that tag-line, but it's not entirely accurate, even though it has a very familiar and eerily recognizable threat at the core the outsiders coming in to a territory that is very close knit and practically inbred, where one wrong step could cost you and/or your loved ones lives. In this case, Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan are the married couple caught in the cross-hairs of kidnapping, blackmail, and ultimately vengeance. They're moving from Massachusets to San Diego, and driving on through the desert they get side-swiped by a car, then later on after a near-altercation at a pit-stop, they move on only for the couple's car to breakdown. Help comes in the form of a trucker, who offers help for to drive the wife to get a tow-truck. No need for the truck, anyway, because the car didn't have much wrong with it...but what about the wife, Amy? From there on in, Mostow takes Breakdown into the realm of paranoid thriller, then into just full-on chase/action/revenge/chase again picture. One might wonder if there could be a more noirish quality to it if the wife actually left for a reason other than abduction, though the path that Mostow takes the story is fine as it is. He keeps things simple in the story sense, with elements of the Western thrown in, but also makes it very much character-based as well. Russell's performance as Jeff Taylor is kind of the opposite of his recent turn as Stuntman Mike in Grindhouse starting off as the average-Joe who tries to be polite, albeit from a yuppie background, he gets put to the test by the enormity of the situation, and finally becomes a real take-no-prisoners hero. Towards the very end it almost reaches the point of being TOO much of hitting over the head with payback, and there are little things regarding the nature of Red Barr (JT Walsh, great villainous presence in a real sinister, calm way) and his ties to the town as to whether or not things are really as controlling as they might be (i.e. the bank scene, which is perfectly acted, though not entirely feasible in the paranoid sense).But all this aside, what Breakdown remains ten years after is a competent, un-pretentious thrill-ride where the dialog is never too heavy, the action is packed with real stunts and few special effects, and some of the brighter moments for Russell in recent years (or rather, the last ten). It knows what it is, and has the professional temerity of a cult effort.

The performances are solid.  Kurt Russell wraps you up in his everyman torn between the terror of losing his wife and the murderous rage he feels towards her abductors.

Cameron is a director who works best with tight scripts and small budgets and ironically Mostow went on to direct TERMINATOR 3 . I think it might be a bad idea to make anymore Terminator movies though . I digress You can understand where the Spielberg comparisons come from . Aged only 26 Mostow wrote and directed this impressive thriller that makes a nod or two to DUEL . Yeah it's not an original movie because there's a few moments that remind you of DELIVERANCE and THE VANISHING but there's only so many times you can take a plot , reshuffle it and come up with something original and  car breaks down in the middle of nowhere  stopped becoming original in the 1970s I think Jeff and Amy Taylor breakdown in the desert and Amy gets a lift to the next town from an affable truck driver who promises he'll drop her off at the nearest diner .

Only thing is she isn't and when meeting the truck driver he denies having met the couple never mind giving her a lift Doesn't that premise sound intriguing ? It sure does and I was thoroughly involved for much of this cinematic journey as the plot takes some sharp and exciting bends . A very impressive road trip . However the climax is slightly disappointing as in much of this genre as the main character - Who the audience can relate to totally - becomes maybe too much of a courageous action hero . It's not a totally unconvincing character arc as in something like 28 DAYS LATER but I didn't think it was an utterly convincing one either and as in many of these stories if you think about the details too much everything collapses . For example why didn't Jeff bother to phone a breakdown service at the start of the movie since it's shown later that he did posses a cell phone ? But I won't nit pick since BREAKDOWN is an involving and entertaining thriller . It's beautifully paced and Kurt Russell is in his element at playing nice guy everyman characters "},{"Title":"A Great Set-Up & A Pay-Off That Doesn't Disappoint","Date":"7 August 2012","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Too often, movies that start with an intriguing set-up disappoint when it gets to the pay-off as they either simply drift into sheer absurdity or else provide an explanation that lacks any kind of credibility. To its great credit, Breakdown doesn't fall into this trap as its set-up provides the introduction to an extremely entertaining action thriller that's full of twists, mystery and suspense. This is an unpretentious film that because of the strength of its plot, some good acting performances and a few well orchestrated action sequences, easily keeps its audience fully engrossed from start to finish.Jeff Taylor (Kurt Russell) and his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan) are a middle class couple from Boston who are on a cross country journey to a new life in San Diego when they have the misfortune to break down on a desert road far from anywhere. Fortuitously, help soon arrives in the form of an affable looking truck driver called Red Barr (J T Walsh) who offers them a lift to a diner some miles down the road. Amy readily accepts this offer so that she can phone for help but Jeff decides to stay with their vehicle which is a very new looking red Jeep Cherokee.After a little time has elapsed, Jeff discovers that the cause of the breakdown was some disconnected wires that are hanging loose below the front of the car. He easily reconnects them and then travels on to the diner where he makes enquiries about his wife. The disinterested and rather unfriendly locals say they haven't seen Amy or Red.A little while later, Jeff catches up with Red's rig and gets him to stop but to his amazement, Red denies knowing him or Amy. Jeff then waves down a passing sheriff called Boyd (Rex Linn) and explains what's happened but after making a few checks and talking to the very plausible Red, Boyd is unable to help any further and suggests that Jeff should visit his deputy to report his wife missing. Jeff follows Boyd's advice but this turns out to be just the start of his long and very dangerous search for his missing wife.As the audience sees the unfolding events through Jeff's eyes, it makes his frustration, anger and fear very real and it also becomes impossible not to empathise with the terrifying predicament that he's in. There's also an ominous sense of paranoia that develops as the universal lack of concern or help that he receives starts to make his experience appear to be part of a conspiracy and leads one to question how close the links are between Red, Boyd and the unsympathetic people at the diner. When the story moves beyond this point, the reality of what's happening soon becomes horrifyingly clear.Kurt Russell very convincingly conveys the mixture of emotions that Jeff goes through during what can only be described as a nightmare scenario and also remains credible as he tackles the various challenges that he encounters. The supporting cast is also very good with J T Walsh and M C Gainey providing the strongest contributions. Kathleen Quinlan does well in her role but has little opportunity to show the extent of her talent due to the limited amount of screen time that she's given.

A sort of mixture taking in elements from Duel and also a film called The Vanishing starring Sandra Bullock and Jeff Bridges. Just goes to show that a simple everyday event can be made into a great film. Some of the action, notably towards the end, is a little implausible but, no matter, this is cinema, and not necessarily a true-to-life documentary. The spectator is amply rewarded for the price of his/her cinema ticket ( or DVD ). Its a shame that Europeans cannot seem to make suspense films of this calibre. But some of the elements and décors like that out-of-the-way diner with all those big fat bearded lorry drivers are just typically American and could not be re-created elsewhere. This film, which is starting to age, is still very popular in France and is present in most videoclubs for hire on DVD. The final scene with the truck hanging over the bridge is a piece of pure cinematic anthology. It's one of those films where one or more scenes will remain indelible in your mind, long after the passing of time.

All what is left to do is searching his wife but it seems that no one can be trusted, not even the police, and where can you ask for help if nobody is around? Quite funny to see it's directed by Jonathan Mostow who recently directed Terminator 3 and just look for the chasing scenes...they're top man!!!!

Luckily helpful truck driver Warren 'Red' Barr (J.T. Walsh) happens to stop & offers them assistance, Amy decides to get into Warre's truck & drive to the next diner to phone for help while Jeff stays with his expensive flashy 4x4, while on his own Jeff manages to get the jeep working again & sets off to meet up with his wife but when he gets to the diner there is no sign of her & no-one there remembers seeing her. Jeff starts to panic & with good reason as he soon finds out that Amy has been kidnapped by Warren & his gang & want a $90,000 ransom or he will kill her. Jeff is on his own & has to think quickly in order to save his wife as he doesn't have the 90,000 the thought of which is the only thing keeping Amy alive...Co-written & directed by Jonathan Mostow one has to say that Breakdown is a terrific, taught & often quite tense little action thriller that I personally rate highly, in my opinion it's certainly one of the better Hollywood made thrillers out there anyway. The script is nice & focused, there's not too much extraneous exposition & just about every scene moves the story forward in some way. The character's are simple yet you understand them, for instance we never find out too much about Jeff or Amy except they are moving house & find themselves in the situation they do & that's all we really need to know, the bad guy's don't have any deep motivation or anything & quite simply they do what they do for the money which is all that we need to know. The film has a good pace, the script throw's all sorts of difficult situations at Jeff & it's very entertaining & often fairly tense to see how he overcomes them. The script also has a really good balance, there's some gripping & intriguing thriller elements, there's some nice action adventure scenes, there's a touch of mystery & just enough exposition without slowing things down too much. Overall I liked Breakdown a lot & it's as simple & straight forward as that, if you think about it hard enough there are probably certain things that Jeff might have done differently & maybe considered slight plot-holes (the IMDb message boards for Breakdown are full of 'why didn't Jeff do this' or 'why didn't he do that' type threads) but that's just nitpicking really since Breakdown is a film so just enjoy it as such.There are some nice action sequences here as a jeeps ends up in a river, there's a couple of car chases including a pretty impressive one at the end & a tense scene in which Jeff has to climb along a truck while it is moving. The one part I didn't like was at the very end as the large truck was hanging off the bridge, my main problem with the scene was what was it hanging by exactly? There's a bit of violence & some profanity but nothing excessive.With a supposed budget of about $36,000,000 Breakdown is well made with good Hollywood polished production values, filmed in California star Kurt Russell was apparently helicoptered in & out of the shooting location so he could be with his family in Los Angeles at night. I must admit to being a bit of a Kurt Russell fan & have liked him in every film of his I have seen & I think he's great in this while the late J.T. Walsh makes for a cold calculating villain.Breakdown is a terrific action thriller & for me has the added bonus of starring one of my favourite Hollywood actors, I liked it a lot & definitely recommend it.

Whatever is going on, and you never quite know for certain, it has an ugly echo of the dark side of country.This could easily have been a style-washed film noir of the Red Rock West variety. Instead, Mostow remains believable, therefore increasing the tension. He makes you feel Taylor's terror and rage. He makes you breathe fast and shallow. Russell can be beef-caked and plastic films like Escape From New York, Big Trouble In Little China. He can be solid wood Stargate and stiff-upper ed The Thing. What Mostow achieves with him here is remarkable.Taylor is not presented in Stallonescope, rather as an ordinary bloke who doesn't know what to do. Russell can slip into stereotype at the scratch of a producer's pen. What makes Breakdown such a convincing ride is his ability to convey fear and courage simultaneously. Taylor's out of his depth. He's scared, but he's going on. Russell throws off the familiar guise, rejects showboat heroics and sweats for real. He's never been better.

Somewhere in Arizona -- in the middle of nowhere -- their SUV breaks down. They are beset by a team of guys that make money on the side by robbing/killing innocent travelers. Their breakdown devolves into an utter nightmare.Breakdown brings to mind four pictures -- The 1973 TV movie Dying Room Only starring Cloris Leachman & Dabney Coleman (with a nice nasty supporting performance by Ned Beatty),written by Richard Matheson. Premise? The same as Breakdown except that the one who disappears is the husband.-- Spielberg's first TV film Duel (1971) Starring Dennis Weaver, which was perhaps the first film addressing the subject of road rage.-- The 1975 film Race with the Devil starring Peter Fonda, which was a car chase thriller about four vacationers and their accidental run-in with a gaggle of Satanists.-- And, lastly, the 1988/1993 film The Vanishing. There are two versions with different actors (but the same director); the first taking place in Europe, the other in America. The story involves a man's obsessive search for his girlfriend who was apparently kidnapped while they were parked at a rest stop.Breakdown successfully combines the plot of the first one with elements of the others is arguably the best of the batch. So, if you liked any of these films, chances are you'll appreciate Breakdown. It should also be noted that the film is great for people who like desert stories or enjoy Southwest scenery.BOTTOM LINE Breakdown is nothing deep, but it's an intense, engaging, realistic thriller along the lines of Duel, albeit more eventful. It will definitely grab and hold your attention its entire 90 minute length. There's a great scene at the end that makes a simple statement Some people have so foolishly opened their hearts to EVIL -- in this case greed, hate, violence and murder -- that they have BECOME hideous non-human monsters (by their own choice). For the sake of society, such people MUST be utterly wiped out from this plane of existence. Hey, the wages of sin is death. Unfortunately we can't trust our justice system any longer.One reviewer irately complained that the story is unrealistic near the beginning of the film; specifically the part where Kurt lets his wife leave with a truck driver while he stays behind to watch his vehicle. He referred to this as an incredibly stupid decision. But I personally don't see what's so unrealistic or stupid about it. They're broke down in the middle of nowhere and their phone won't work. The truck driver who offers to take them to the next stop is seemingly normal, benevolent, helpful and friendly. Both of them couldn't go because one had to stay and guard their vehicle, which contained many of their possessions (remember, they were moving). And it wouldn't have been right for Kurt to let his wife stay alone with the jeep since there was some hick nutjob roaming the local area who had harassed them a bit earlier, not to mention they didn't have any type of weapon. It was a bad situation and Kurt chose the safest, most reasonable option available.Breakdown strangely didn't do very well at the box office in 1997. It has, however, been a bit of a hit on video/DVD since that time.

I stumbled upon this gem when it was released on VHS some 10+ years ago, and, as I recently browsed the somewhat deflated selection of films available in my Watch Instantly Netflix queue, decided to give it another go. Once again diving headlong into this ballet of desert highway carnage was like getting reacquainted with an old friend; consequently, this has caused me to lament the stale-by- comparison state of many recent road rage thrillers offered up by Hollywood.If you've never seen Breakdown, it could be described as a more intelligent version of Joy Ride (or, perhaps, The Hitcher). It's about a married couple named Jeff (Russell) and Amy (Quinlan) who are driving cross country&#x97;from Boston to San Diego&#x97;to take on more lucrative employment opportunities. Along the way, they almost collide with a local in a pick-up truck on a remote desert highway. When they stop at the next gas station, the fella driving the truck&#x97;a black-clad hombre with a handlebar mustache and a cowboy hat&#x97;proceeds to chew out Jeff for his idiotic behavior behind the wheel. The two eventually call a truce, part ways, and go about their lives. It's not long, however, before Jeff's brand new Jeep inexplicably breaks down. As the couple is trying to assess the situation, a man in an 18-wheeler stops, offers assistance, and eventually ends up suggesting the pair ride with him to the nearest town so they can call a tow truck. Jeff is leery about leaving his car on the side of a highway with a local lunatic on the prowl, so Amy hops in the semi, presumably to wait for her husband at a diner as he figures out what to do. Once she leaves, Jeff discovers the problem, fixes the car, and heads to the diner. When he gets there, though, Amy is nowhere to be found. The locals have no idea who she is, and they all claim to have never seen her. What ensues is a maddeningly wild goose chase across barren southwestern terrain as Jeff does everything in his power to find his spouse.There are twists and turns aplenty, and the action is great. The most disturbing thing about the film is how genuine it all seems. I have no trouble believing that something like this could (and perhaps has) occur in such remote locales, and there's a real sense of desperation to everything that's unfolding. Russell is great as the panicked husband who knows he's going to have to take things to the extreme to get his wife back, and almost&#x97;almost&#x97;every one of his decisions seems completely rational. The movie does give way to certain conventions from time to time, and I wish it would've built up the paranoia just a little longer before the big reveal occurs (a la Arlington Road), but there's no denying the intensity on display here.That being said, who's ready for a road trip?

In essence, it's a B-movie with a better cast than usual; one of those films I saw and liked years and years ago and which has stayed with me ever since. I recently revisited the film on DVD and was surprised to discover that it's actually an excellent little action/mystery/thriller and one of my all-time favourites.The ever under-appreciated Kurt Russell stars as that classic archetype, the ordinary guy, who finds himself out of his depth when his wife goes missing after hitching a ride with a seemingly kindly trucker. I won't spoil what happens after that, only to saw that the screenplay is absolutely loaded with suspense. Truly, you could hear a pin drop as I sat watching this film, riveted to the screen; the bank scene is the real highlight, but the later antics pay off nicely too. Things culminate with a nicely directed action scene featuring some great car stunts.Much of the film's success comes from the casting of Russell, whose acting adds immeasurably to the experience. He's one of those instantly identifiable and likable actors who you end up rooting for from the outset, even in more conflicted roles like the one he played in corrupt cop yarn DARK BLUE. If only Tarantino's DEATH PROOF had been more like this movie! Instead, the directorial duties are handled by Jonathan Mostow, his debut picture, and he does a wonderful job. I equally enjoyed his follow-up films, U-571 and even TERMINATOR 3 RISE OF THE MACHINES, although I'll admit that SURROGATES was a little lacking in the substance stakes. J. T. Walsh also does a nice job in a supporting role, and it's fun to see M. C. Gainey given something larger than a cameo for a change.

After 5 minutes I was hooked. To me the best thing about Breakdown is its real-life portrayal of ordinary people undergoing a sudden trauma. The second best thing is the non-stop action. But Kurt Russell in particular does a great job acting a man facing up to evil situation, and his gradual adjustment. In a typical tough-guy beat-em-up movie, the hero would be taking control of the situation right away. But in Breakdown, the bad guys have the upper hand, and a nearly fool-proof plan for getting away with extortion and likely murder. Russell at first is confused what is happening, then when the villains demand the money, he is finally able to think of his alternatives. All the while his face shows his torn emotions, still not quite believing what has happened to him, fighting panic, but forcing himself to think clearly. As the story moves along, he realizes these guys may actually plan to kill both of them even after they get the ransom, which is a whole new dilemma. He can swear to vent his frustration but that is about it. No heroics will save his wife until the time is right, and Russell shows that agony in those moments he has to submit to the kidnappers. JT Barr also makes a great cold-blooded villain, maintaining his cool from the start. And Quinlain, who I love as an actress (think Apollo 13) doesn't have a big role but she plays it perfectly. See this movie for a lesson in how good actors can overcome a middle budget movie and make it well worth watching.

So in the first half you might not want to watch when you're a bit tired. But all this will come back later, so pay attention. The cops, the diner patrons and the truckers all have an important part to play when this blows wide open.This is one of the most intense Kurt Russell films out there, at least without being silly or science fiction. No John Carpenter or Snake Plissken here. Just a man who goes to the edge when the woman he loves is gone. Jumping on moving semi trailers, getting in gun fights, kidnapping kidnappers. Russell gets more and more bold as the film goes on (which makes the film sort of like Falling Down, but that's the only way they are similar).Not sure what else you need to know since that's the gist Kurt Russell getting angry.

The film, however, suffers a little because of the second-rate cast and its performance. It probably would've been a far better breed of suspense flick with a different set of actors. If you're into biting your nails and eating a bucket of popcorn at the same time while sitting on the edge of your seat, then this movie might be for you. If, on the other hand, you're into a little more cerebral psychological thriller with some very haunting ending, go rent The Vanishing. The latter, with a very few minor flaws notwithstanding, has the power to linger in a viewer's mind, although in a disturbing way, long after the lights come back on.

He conveys there characters descent into desperation and terror very well &#x96; to a point where forces that start manipulating his character cause something in him to snap and his character finds an untapped source of courage &#x96; being driven by an unstoppable urge to find a loved one. Russell charts this character journey well, yet the fear never leaves his character &#x96; he just evolves to handle it within the extraordinary situation he finds himself in. Other performances are solid, particularly the late J.T Walsh as the main protagonist and Rex Linn as an empathic sheriff. Director Jonathon Mostow has an effective and sophisticated take on the filmmaking. He develops the story gradually, allow the suspense and pace to continually build up throughout the film. Technical credits are solid, including editing and Douglas Milsome's excellent photography. The growing tension and dread builds up brilliantly throughout the film, leading to an excellent action oriented climax and a coda that is reminiscent of early 70's US movie-making. Overall simple but a brilliantly executed movie.

When a trucker, Red Barr, stops to offer some help, Amy goes with Red to the closest town to phone for a tow truck. Some hours pass and when there's still no sign of a tow truck or Amy, Jeff becomes concerned, so after managing to finally get the car to get going again, he travels to where he was supposed to meet his wife but there is no sign of her. Out on the road again, Jeff comes across the same trucker that was supposed to help the couple, but the driver denies that he's ever seen him before. Adamant to find out what has happened to his wife, Jeff finds himself being caught up in a deadly game for survival and a race against time to find his wife.Breakdown is a classic example of a really good, cat-and-mouse action/thriller that doesn't fail to deliver with good performances from both Kurt Russell and J.T. Walsh. Russell brings a nice believability to his character that he's just a normal guy (and doesn't have any ex-forces or martial arts training that so many of these types of movies have for their main good guy) who's desperate to find his wife, and Walsh is just classic J.T. Walsh in playing a guy you just love to hate.The story, while being a wee bit predictable in a couple of places, has enough twists and turns to keep your interest and to keep you guessing as to what will happen next for the most part. The film is also not lacking in suspense or tension either. Does it keep you on the edge of your seat? Well, I guess that depends on how much suspense you need in a film for that to happen, but for me there's more than enough here for the majority of viewers to feel a decent level of tension.Mix this with the very believable performances from Russell and Walsh and you have yourself a really good thriller with a nice amount of action. I definitely recommend giving this movie a go.

Before this, a little disbelief has to be suspended - just how have they got away with it for so long?! - but this is a fine line any thriller has to tread. The setting and protagonists are grounded in a mundaneness which we can immediately identify with a long-distance drive by a middle-class husband and wife (the Taylors) in the process of a big move. They are a little weary and have their problems, but their obvious affection for each other is touching. Onto this platform is built the crisis which we know will develop, and it unfolds at exactly the right speed with exactly the right air of intrigue, beginning with an encounter with a red-neck local and soon a seemingly random and inexplicable breakdown (hence the title). All the characters are thoroughly convincing, with the antagonists having an air of menace alla Deliverance, we can easily imagine finding ourselves in this perilous situation 'out there'.The premise is common-place enough - kidnap and the attempt at rescue - but the treatment of it is finely-scripted and tense. Just a pity the last act turns it into a boys-own adventure, where for me disbelief could no longer be 'suspended' (pun - you'll understand from the final scenes). Excellent performances across the entire cast with Russell, as so often, making the ideal 'every-man tested'. M.C Gainey ('Earl') always scares the **** out of me with his aggressive presence, Jack Noseworthy's 'Billy' makes one's skin crawl for the dangerous creep he is, but top honours go to J.T. Walsh as 'Red'. It's a performance of subtle charisma, from his early interactions on the road with Mr Taylor, to the full revelation of his character.

Walsh, make for entertaining adversaries in this relentlessly tense and lightning paced movie that delivers the thrills in a big way. It has basically realistic characters doing basically believable things, which puts Breakdown above other movies of its type.Kurt stars as Jeff Taylor, a man moving from Boston to San Diego with his wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan). They've had some money problems and are hoping for a change in their fortunes. What happens is that their car breaks down in the country. Along comes a trucker named Red (Walsh) who offers to drive them to a place where they can phone for help. Jeff opts to stay with the car, and when he tries to hook up with Amy at the agreed rendezvous point, she's nowhere to be found. Jeff frantically tries to search for her, with little to no help from anybody, and ends up in some pretty hair raising episodes as he gets caught up in a plot hatched by some very bad guys.Kurt is fantastic as an ordinary guy who is forced to do some extraordinary things. He's not your standard movie hero who faces everything stoically and with a quip for every dangerous occasion; he's actually frightened and out of his depth but still determined to find his mate. Quinlan can't do much with a role that disappears from the story for a while, but she's as appealing as she's ever been. Walsh is perfect malevolent fun as a really evil bastard with an unsuspecting wife (Moira Sinise) and kid (Vincent Berry).Director Jonathan Mostow, who also co-wrote the screenplay based on his own story, has his movie hit the ground running and never stop moving. It emphasizes the isolation of the surroundings at every turn and keeps coming up with obstacles for its hero to overcome. It's also commendable in the way that it shows villains who have to change their modus operandi when their scheme doesn't work out as they wanted it to. There's also a chilling moment when Jeff is staring at a bulletin board littered with scores of posters of missing persons. 100,000 people go missing in this country every year, says a deputy, and we don't disbelieve him.Lots of wonderful scenery, and music by Basil Poledouris that matches the movies' pace, help a great deal, as well as a solid supporting cast including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy as two of the accomplices, Rex Linn as the level headed police chief, and Jack McGee as a cranky bartender.Breakdown is just pure entertainment that moves along to a rather brutal conclusion.

Unfortunately I didn't get to see it until recently and I am quite happy that I did. I quite like Kirt Russell as and actor the movies that he appears in tend to be very entertaining. I am thinking mostly of Tango and Cash and Big Trouble in Little China. Well, he didn't disappoint me in this movie either.Kirt Russell plays a business man moving from Boston to San Diaego with his wife. They have bought a new Jeep Cherokee and are taking the scenic route through the desert. On the way they almost hit a black pickup and the guy is not too happy. After a few words at the petrol station, they leave and break down along the road. A semi-trailer pulls up and offers to give his wife a lift to the nearest town. Unfortunately she never arrives and Kirt manages to fix the car up himself. When he catches up with the Semi, the man says that he has not seen his wife and shows him an empty truck.What has happened is that they have kidnapped his wife and are demanding 90,000 dollars, which he does not have, to get her back. Later in the film you discover that these people do this regularly, and even though they are rednecks, they are actually quite deceitful. The truck driver pretends to be a very nice loving man with a family and Billy plays the roll of a slow boy. The other two in the scam are simply muscle and use brute force to get their way.It is the start of the movie that is the most chilling because his wife has disappeared and there is no idea as to what has happened to her. Most people say that she has left him but he refuses to believe this. His love for his wife means that he will go to any extent to find her. This isn't a marriage of convenience or lust, but one truly of love. He is willing to put himself in danger to get her back.Breakdown is an enjoyable movie. My prediction from the previews was right. It is suspenseful and exciting. It is an action movie with a lot of suspense and the end leaves you gasping for breath. Breakdown is a cool movie and is recommended by me.

Walsh, my supporting player in the superb Windmills of the Gods, is no longer with us, but I guess I don't have to draw you a picture.Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan are a well-off Yuppie couple on their way to a new job in California when their car breaks down. A menacing pick up truck zooms past and stops down the road. Looks like trouble among the monuments of Monument Valley. But then J. T. Walsh drives up in his semi and offers to give them a lift to a diner a few miles down the road. Russell and Quinlan have been keeping an eye on that ominous pick up and Russell decides that he'd better stay with the car and maybe Walsh can drive his wife to the diner where she can call the auto club.It was wise of Russell not to desert the car. Anything might have happened. My car once blew a rod on a lonely stretch of desert road near St. George, Utah, and it was several days before I could have it retrieved. Three months later, the FBI knocked on my mother's door in New Jersey and asked about the abandoned car. No kidding.Okay, okay. That's pointless divagation you say, and you're right. I only bring it up to illustrate a point, namely that Kurt Russell's character isn't entirely stupid or, at least, no more stupid than most of us. As a hero, Russell exemplifies Northrop Frye's low mimetic mode. He's just like the rest of us, except for an element of luck, as he goes about unraveling the mystery of his wife's disappearance.Because she does indeed disappear. Russell waits by the car and neither his wife nor the auto club show up, so he manages to get the vehicle started himself and drives to the diner. It's one of those bleak desert stops with a nasal voice crooning some Western ballad in the background and a dozen silent patrons scattered around. Nobody has seen either Quinlan or Walsh. The counter man is a little resentful that he should be asked about it.It's a rather neatly done and enjoyable thriller, as thrillers go. It's full of élan and formulaic incidents. Probably nothing you see or hear will make you gasp with surprise but it's a lot of fun seeing these things played out on the screen, reassuringly familiar, like a church service or a family dinner. I'll give an example to point up the properties of the movie. Russell manages to stab a particularly vicious bad guy in the chest with an eight-inch letter opener -- up to the hilt. Does this kill the bad guy? Or -- no, that's too easy. Does it even SLOW HIM DOWN? The bang-up ending is a multiple car chase that winds up with a truck and a car hooked together and dangling from a high bridge while Quinlan is trapped within the endangered car and two men are having a brawl on and around the truck beneath.The scenery is majestic, evoking images and memories of other movies, other directors. The location is John Ford territory. The movie is rather more commercial than its setting.

Lucky for them J.T. Walsh as long-haul trucker Red Barr comes along, offers friendly help, and ends up giving Amy a lift to the diner and phone 5 miles away, while Jeff stays with the car.

But they never saw Russell play Snake Plisskin in Escape From New York. Compared to that, this should be very easy.SPOILERS FOLLOW The car breakdown was no accident, while at the gas station and the kidnappers saw him and his pretty wife, one of them pulled loose some wires under the hood. When Jeff found and rectified this, and got his car running, he went to the diner but got nowhere. Eventually he encountered the others who demanded a ransom to get his wife back.

It is actually a stylish mystery/thriller/actioner that moves beyond common cinematic structure and intelligently plays tricks on the audience.  The viewer is drawn into the helplessness of the protagonist (Kurt Russell) who is caught in a desperate surreal situation in which the unexplained disappearance of his wife provokes little or no reaction from the locals.  A police officer, responding to Russell's claim that his wife is missing or kidnapped, asks `is it possible she could have left you?'There are several sequences in which it initially appears that the story may be resorting to overused plot techniques when it is actually building on the audience's false expectations.  This arouses the viewer's interest in terms of where the plot is headed and leaves room for a great deal of speculation.Consider the following a long tension-filled camera shot of a truck slowing down in the distance, turning around, and coming to a complete stop suggesting that the occupants are refusing to forgive Russell for involving them in a near vehicular accident (never mind who's fault it would have been).  What were the occupants' intentions as they watched Russell from the distant truck?  An evil conspiracy (but what?) appears to be present in a small town (but who and how many?) which is backed up by the police (but is this actually true?).We meet a friendly good-ole-boy who stops his truck to offer Russell's wife a lift to the nearest towing facility after their vehicle breaks down and thirty minutes later mysteriously denies ever meeting them (was it a twin driving a similar truck?).  There's a complacent deputy, a dismissive bartender, and an alleged town idiot who provides questionable information and then appears to save Russell from an uncertain fate. This provides the movie with an effective Hitchcockian touch.  Just when the viewer is lulled into the belief that he has unraveled the mystery, the plot twists in a new direction and he realizes that, in this film, events do not unfold with anything resembling predictability.  Several ambiguous scenes only begin to make sense as the solid story gradually reveals itself.The portrayal of villainy in this film is utterly believable and delivered with a frighteningly raw intensity that far exceeds the usual contrived comic book evil of many films of this genre.  This leaves the viewer with a rather unsettled feeling of the evil people lurking in this world.I will admit that the climactic scenes at the film's end fall into the trap of satisfying the audience's usual desire for mindless entertainment but the action scenes are definitely well executed.  It has been stated that the final act of revenge was in poor taste but in forcing the viewer to confront man's inhumanity to man, it paints a vivid picture of the suffering that could have taken place earlier at the hands of the villains.  Since entertainment is a necessary element in film, one could decide to label 'Breakdown' as a popcorn-chewing film and let it stand out as one of the best.*****/5 stars  "},{"Title":"loved every minute of it!","Date":"8 September 2003","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Let me begin by saying that even though I watched it on network T.V. with edits and commercial breaks, this was one of the most exciting films I've ever seen. I won't bother to re-hash to plot, which you can read about from other reviews, but I will make a few critical comments.Firstly, I agree with other reviewers, that it may be a little far fetched that Kurt Russell would chose to stay with his Jeep rather then go along with the trucker and his wife. However, JT Walsh, as the trucker truly did come across as a genuinely nice guy. He was clean-cut and well-spoken in contrast to the other dirty red-necks in the film. So unless one had the audiences advantage, a person very well may have reacted the same way as the characters did in this situation. Also, the fact that the Kurt Russell character was more concerned with the safety of his SUV than his wife may have been a subtle commentary by the filmmaker on the materialism of the yuppies that Kurt Russell's character represented. It should be noted that the Kurt Russell in this film was a little softer and pudgier than say the Snake Pliskin character he played in the `Escape' movies.I would also, like to say that I agree with others in that the final chase scene was superfluous and the film could have effectively ended in the barn. Nevertheless in that final scene, I saw no ambiguity in the characters finishing off a helpless villain. I believe it was his wife that actually did the deed, and it is left up to the audience to imagine what horrors the wife may have  suffered at the hands of the villains that motivated her to act in such a way.Finally I was never clear as to what the villains original intent for the crime was. My impression was that the ransom idea was initiated by the wife in a desperate attempt  to save herself from being killed by the kidnappers. If that was the case, then what were they originally after?Those few criticisms aside, I must say, that I was on the edge of my seat for the entire film, and loved every minute of it!

So, once again, spoilers ahead.  Can't hear me? SPOILERS!!!  There, now on with the show.***I'm sick of reading reviews from major critics that completely miss the point of any given motion picture.  I mean, for crying out loud, aren't these people supposed to do this for a living?  People actually pay good money for inaccurate, bumbling misinterpretations?  So why am I still working at Suncoast Motion Picture Company (Where You Buy Movies)?Breakdown is a film that really threw critics for a loop.  A certain man-ball of a critic (no names) found it to be effective, but said that the film didn't deserve its ending.  I've heard and read other people say and write that the ending of the film is morally reprehensible.  Ridiculous. Anyone who would say that has utterly failed to relate to the characters, which in my not-so-humble opinion denotes that the film is essentially no good.  But then why would this rotund critic give the film a recommendation, if the film is no good?  Well, let's see.  It's a film of great tension, suspense, and excitement.  It presents us with every wedded man's nightmare scenario, and depicts the trials that that man would undertake in order to find his loved one again.  It also impresses the ever-lovin' bajeezus out of us with great performances from the entire cast (this is my second favorite Kurt Russell performance, behind The Thing), a creepy score by Basil Poledouris, and some of the best vehicular stunt work since The Road Warrior.  So perhaps, for these reasons, a good review is warranted.  But because of the ending, obviously, it can and forever will be merely a good film.What critics and audiences don't seem to grasp is the reality of the aforementioned nightmare scenario.  If you were to go through hours of torment and despair at the hands of sadistic, bloodthirsty madmen, would you not want to exact vengeance upon said madmen?  Would you not want to ensure their demise, thus defending yourself as well as countless others who would fall prey to their snidely machinations?  Or would you stop at the last moment, when they've been defeated but not quite destroyed, opting to let justice be served?  Would you be a hero, or a human being?That's the whole point of the film, you see, that many critics could not understand.  These people are not heroes, nor would they ever claim to be. They're merely two people caught in a maelstrom of desperation, horror, running purely on survival instincts.  And, once the vengeful deed has been done, the two grip each other, traumatized, fearful, and utterly alone. They don't laugh, crack one-liners, or even kiss.  They just hold each other, the harrowing experience gasping death shudders as it passes through and away from them.  It's an extremely effective, resonant tone that the film ends upon.But I guess it wasn't so effective or resonant with those that disliked the ending.  Why, you ask?  My guess is that it taps a little too far into the most base of human desires.  An eye for an eye sentiment, a human roadblock of a film critic once wrote.  But said roadblock and many others misunderstood because they failed to put themselves into the victims' shoes. Perhaps the film does go into action mode a little to heavily during the climax, and people don't relate to action heroes because they have never endured an action sequence.  But, despite that, think of what these people have been through.  Think of their suffering.  Think of their fear.  And then think of that last moment before the final shot of the film, and tell me you don't cheer, be it inside or out.  Just try and tell me.Breakdown is a brilliantly paced, tautly made, wonderfully acted film that not only succeeds as a thriller but also portrays the everyman and everywoman in the heat of struggle, and their emergence from it as victors, victims no longer.  The ending is morally ambiguous, to be sure, but it is also profound in terms of the humanity of the characters.  In a lawless situation, where no one else can help you, self-defense equates to the destruction of the enemy, plain and simple.  Whether or not the actual killing of the enemy was necessary for their own survival is questionable, but one thing is certain no one will ever be victimized by this enemy again.  Perhaps I've been reading too many Punisher comics, but that sounds like justice to me.See you at the Motion Picture Company.

He is nervous, distraught and scared throughout the movie. Some of the weaker points of the movie are when his wife accepts the ride alone (I would never separate from my wife in that situation, but I'm sure there are some people that wouldn't give it a second thought).  The other weakness is the ending, here is where the movie does fall into the same mold as most action movies.

Used to laugh when people would commemorate this stuff around here.  But then it hits ya.  200 is a pretty big number for hobby film reviews.  I was saving this film especially because....Now THIS is filmmaking!  1990-1992 produced some fairly decent films. Leftovers from 80s movie-making teams I suppose.  But once the 90s got into full swing around '93, I swear to you (and movie buffs keep track of these things), I liked a total of THREE movies the rest of the decade.  Three. Naked Gun 3, Con-Air, and this.  Nothing compared to the 80s for me. Still don't.  But somehow this little thriller worked it's way into the mind of someone who knows how to make movies.  I'm going to spend more time on who makes up the film more than what it's about.  Because it basically comes down to this Russell and his wife are crossing the country to start new jobs.  He has one of those scary bully confrontations that you always wonder what would I do?.  When their truck craps out on a lonely highway, the wife takes a ride with a trucker as Russell doesn't want to leave the vehicle alone.  After fishing around the engine, he discovers a couple of cables unhooked, clicks 'em in place, and is on his way.  The big problem no one has seen his wife or the trucker, which begins an oddessy of useless police reports and violent kidnappers.  For me, the key to any film is pacing and ideas, and this thing just moves and moves rapid-fire.  The only time it slows is during the bank sequence, which appears, fortunately, to have been cut short (it ends rather abruptly).  The ending of the film, oh my.  When I saw those three trucks surround  Russell and his wife, I actually thought for once the bad guys were going to win in a movie.  They were just so relentless.  Earlier, when Rusell kicks a guy down some stairs, for the first maybe ever, I actually rose from my couch cheering!!  I was SO into this.  And for those who critisize the ending as being mean or overkill, I found it totally neccessary.  Especially for the character who puts it in motion.  After the hell the characters go through, I think they deserved the give the bad dude a real splatter.  Ok, performances. Russell, a little grunty at times, is as solid as ever; Gainey, an effective southern meanie; Noseworthy isn't given much to do, though he does fool us early on; there's a big, bearded guy who has one line of dialogue on camera, who's otherwise just there and dubbed at times; Quinlan is attractive and has a comic charm in her early scenes; but when you look at the big picture, JT Walsh just walks off with this thing.  Understated, suave, confident, the guy was a brilliant actor.  This was the first time I really saw him as it was the meatiest role of his career.  So many times he played minor characters in good movies.  Here he gets to really show us his great skill. I was extremely saddened to find out he died shortly after the film's completion.  Really looked forward to more of his work.  As for the film as a whole, it does have its inperfections.  Basil Poledouris score is mostly great (the opening credits have a cool tone), but goes a little melodramatic near the end.  There's the afformentioned bank scene, Russell's useless climb all over a semi, and the laughable dubbing of Quinlan's screams at the end (Oh, my leg! as her boobs swing around, phhttt).  But those only take up about a minute of this whole thing, a tense, active drama that keeps descending into many layers.  Way better than Duel, which got repetitive with only two characters, but barely below The Hitcher, which had a more constant pace, in the much too small road/psychodrama genre.

There's a Hitchcockian element throughout, actually, and I could imagine the Hitchster putting together a film very much like this were he still going.  Most of the movie is steeped in paranoia, aided by interesting camera work and tight close-ups that capture Kurt Russell's totally convincing acting the part of a man whose life has suddenly fallen to pieces.  The many faces of paranoia (justified paranoia, as we soon discover) in the film include the red-herring kind as embodied by the 'characters' on display in a desert diner.  The air of intrigue and bad deeds, and conspiracy, is palpable in the two scenes set within the diner but, in the end, the diner's manager and patrons turn out to be benign. Well, maybe.  I've spent a fair bit of time poking around the Mojave Desert (by the way, one apparent biogeographical error is showing a Joshua tree in what I believe is supposed to be Arizona) and can attest that you'll see the darndest things out there.  That includes people.  So the desert setting really struck a chord with me, too.  Taken as a whole, the encounter with the diner's denizens and a run-in with the 'necks who soon turn out to be the bad guys may give the viewer a feeling of deja-vu for something along the lines of Deliverance, but the menace here is far more prosaic and firmly focused on the bottom line.Kurt Russell is perfectly cast as the Massachusetts yuppie traveling with his wife to a new life in San Diego.  His aspiring yuppie credentials are established by the bright red SUV with leather interior, his powder blue polo shirt, and paper cups of designer coffee.  This is a pretty insipid Kurt Russell character -- certainly a 'wimp' in comparison to the larger-than-life (and inevitably self-parodying) heroes that he played with such tongue-in-cheek bravado in films like the stellar Big Trouble In Little China and Escape From New York.  But that's where the key to the effectiveness of his character resides.  He's so totally unprepared for brutality and action that most of us watching -- most of whom would also soundly qualify as 'wimps' when measured against the fictional prowess of movie action heroes -- can identify all too well with the situation that he suddenly finds himself in.  He does the best that he can with what he has, and the fact is that he is not as adaptable and resourceful as McGyver and not even in the same league (and therefore more truthful) as any of the larger-than-life action heroes that've proliferated in such abundance since the original James Bond movies.  It's also what makes so much more triumphant his victories over the bad guys, who have a definite advantage over him in terms of numbers, firepower, experience, and ability to deal violence.  But old Kurt's Jeff character has outrage on his side, once he finds out what's happening.  Before long his polo shirt is dirty and he has transformed himself into a makeshift action hero who feels about as real-life an example of that category as we're likely to see in a fictional Hollywood movie.  And so it makes it all the sweeter when he kicks the main bad dude in the head, or gets one up on the mustachioed psychopath who thinks he has him totally cowed.  It's hard not to feel redeemed when the tide begins to turn in the favor of Kurt Russell's 'everyman.'  This kind of thing happens, too -- how would we fare under identical, wholly plausible, circumstances?The supporting cast in this film is excellent.  Kathleen Quinlan, the wife who's kidnapped, doesn't have all that much screen time but is effective in her interaction with Kurt Russell's Jeff Taylor.  MC Gainey is wonderfully despicable in his role as desert redneck Earl, a man who possesses no obvious redeeming qualities.  Jack Noseworthy is also chilling as the young bad guy, Billy.  It's JT Walsh, though (the somewhat unhinged sergeant-major in Good Morning, Vietnam), who -- along with Kurt Russell -- really carries this film forward.  He was an inspired casting decision, and his icy calm and absolute believability as he denied his obvious actions to both Jeff and to the local Sheriff are pure menace, totally understated in delivery but there in the movie's context.  And when he gets nasty...well, then he's even nastier.Beautiful setting, too.  There's something about the American Southwest that speaks -- to me, anyway -- of freedom and possibility (try riding a motorcycle around it one day!) and those elements are subtly woven into this story with both positive and negative connotations.Having spent more than a few years in Georgia, I've experienced first hand the unwelcome attentions of some of the more drugged-out or perhaps just plain psychotic drivers who push their trucks across the country and this movie also plays on the fear of anyone who's ever had a belligerent trucker threaten to squish 'em.  Disclaimer  I'm not some rabidly bigoted anti-trucker type...my father drove trucks for a long time, my favorite performer -- Elvis -- started out as a truck driver, and I bought the whole trucker and Convoy craze in the '70s and, indeed, love the Peckinpah movie of that particular song.  In real life, in the US, I've just had some unfortunate encounters with various defective members of that subculture.The renegade truck driver thing's been done before -- Steven Spielberg's freaky and excellent Duel in 1971 being a notable film -- but this film definitely stands alone as a uniquely effective whodunnit/journey/revenge movie.  Jonathon Mostow wrote and directed it and I give him full credit for creating a suspenseful masterpiece on only his third outing in those combined roles.  Unfortunately, he then went on to make U-571 on the strength of this movie's success.

Out of nowhere, their Jeep Grand Cherokee breaks down on a desolate road in the middle of the Arizona desert. A helpful trucker (the late J.T. Walsh) takes Amy to a pay phone at a diner, but she never makes it there. As Jeffrey frantically searches for her, he quickly finds himself getting into more than he ever bargained for.Quinlan sleepwalks through her thankless part until after her abduction, but otherwise there are plenty of strong, believable performances here, with the best being from Walsh, Russell, and especially M.C. Gainey, who portrays Earl, one of Amy's abductors. Jack Noseworthy (watch for his introductory scene in the diner parking lot) and Ritch Brinkley are two other partners in crime. Rex Linn, a good actor, seems to have an affinity for getting shot in his films (Wyatt Earp and Drop Zone), and it's no exception here in his role as a police officer.The real standouts of Breakdown are the cinematography and costume design. DP Doug Milsome shoots the hectic action sequences in tight frames (such as a brawl in a speeding truck), and wobbly handhelds are used to show the world through Jeff's perspective. Both are effective at creating tension. For example, in one scene where Jeff is being pursued by a dirty black pickup, we see plenty of Jeff's fearful expression in between shots of both cars speeding down the road, but we don't see the identity of his pursuer. It's a smart move, because we don't want to identify with the crook or see the chase through his viewpoint. In fact, the bad guys appear only whenever Jeff is within their vicinity, and they're not seen until our heroes are established.While Jeff and Amy wear preppy, light-colored upper-class outfits like Polo shirts, khakis and Benetton sweaters (the latter humorously interpreted by a bartender as button-on), the baddies and locals wear plaid shirts, dirty jeans and baseball caps, and sport nothing less than a five-o'-clock shadow.

Russell has the talent of being able to take his roles and play them in a way that makes us forget we're watching Kurt Russell. His films feel more like movies that Kurt Russell just happens to be in, rather than a Kurt Russell movie. In BREAKDOWN, Russell gives what is probably the best performance of his career, playing an ordinary man thrust into an incredible and very realistic situation. The late, great J.T. Walsh does a great job going from kind, helpful passerby to cold blooded killer. I wish Kathleen Quinlan could have been on screen more because she's a talented actress, but keeping her off screen for as long as she is helps to create the tension in the film. Writer/director Jonathan Mostow weaves an air-tight story of desperation, terror, suspense, and (eventually) action that keeps the film moving at a brisk pace. The entire way, we're glued to the screen and Russell's quest to find out the truth. When he gets the upperhand on one of Walsh's goons in the guy's own trunk, we can't help but feel a sigh of relief that things are starting to look up for him. The final showdown at Walsh's ranch builds in suspense until it finally erupts into all-out action as Russell and Quinlan attempt to escape from Walsh and his two goons in a thrilling highway chase, culminating in one of the most intense confrontations I've ever seen, with Russell and Walsh fighting on Walsh's semi-truck cab as it hangs precariously over the side of a bridge. One part THE VANISHING, one part DUEL, and one part Hitchcock, BREAKDOWN is one great movie.

It was a moderate hit, but not an overwhelming smash.Kurt Russell is the film's Everyman, who, while driving with his wife (Kathleen Quinlan) from New England to San Diego, finds himself at the mercy of a group of vicious redneck highway pirates in the Southwest.  These thugs, led by the incredibly evil J.T. Walsh, have no mercy for this rich a--hole lookin' for trouble when they kidnap Quinlan and threaten to kill her unless he delivers them $90,000 (money which, of course, he doesn't have).  The trap is set when one of them sabotages his Jeep and causes it to break down on an isolated Utah highway (hence the film's title).  From then on in, the terror and suspense escalate to a gear-grinding, nerve-wracking high-speed pursuit finale involving several big rigs and other cars.Jonathan Mostow, who directed and co-wrote the film, may derive his plot from various other films; but if he can be accused of stealing, at least he steals from some rather good sources.  There are elements of Steven Spielberg's masterful 1971 terror masterpiece DUEL, John Boorman's DELIVERANCE, Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS, and George Sluzier's 1988 film THE VANISHING to be found in BREAKDOWN.  At a time when the term action thriller had been nailed down to just a few select actors (Schwarzenneger, Van Damme, Segal, Lundgren, Willis, etc.), BREAKDOWN gives us Russell, a far more believable central character than basically any of those guys.  Quinlan arguably doesn't have much to do, but she becomes very important to us anyway because of Russell's own deep concerns.  And Walsh is absolutely frightening in a very low-key way as the chief heavy, with his cronies (including M.C. Gainey and Jack Noseworthy) right up there with the bounty hunters of THE WILD BUNCH and the redneck rapists of DELIVERANCE for sheer brutality.For those who appreciate action and tension without too many explosions (there only happens to be ONE in this whole film), BREAKDOWN is the ticket.

It is one of the best, most underrated thrillers I've ever seen and deserves a much higher rating than 6.7. I'd say between 8 or 9 judging by IMDb rating standards if i'm honest with you. It really was that good, i'm very surprised to say! The suspense in this movie truly is incredible, and certainly up there with the class of Hitchcock and honestly if you love suspense thrillers like I do then you'll have to check this movie out.The plot is very simple and I don't want to get into it like in most of my reviews, but its also very interesting and unique. This is in the style of another movie I've seen and thought was very suspenseful, Joy Ride or Road Kill as its known over here in the UK, in the sense that they're both plausible and you couldn't rule out either of them being believable. They're both road movies about characters stuck in situations which you and they don't know how the hell they're going to get out of. Well I certainly didn't anyway.However, this movie is not really about peoples mistakes like Joy Ride was. Well, I suppose it is but they're completely different. In this movie just about anyone could make the mistake the main characters did but in Joy Ride only young people would. And that made it plausible and that made that movie work for me because i'm young and people of my age would do things like that. In other road movies like Jeepers Creepers, I wasn't in suspense at all because the plot just wasn't plausible whatsoever.Anyway, back to this movie. It is great on just about every level actually. Acting, Writing, Directing, Cinematography, some brilliantly haunting Music by the underrated Basil Poledouris, and even the Stuntwork, which handled one of the best Car Chases I've ever seen, at the end. However, this is not an action movie, and I seriously don't understand why some critics didn't know whether this was an action movie or a mystery. The Car Chase if anything, actually adds to the suspense and had me right on the edge of my seat. Kurt Russell gives possibly his best performance I've ever seen him give in this movie as a guy who does what any normal person would do in the situation he's in. Thats another reason why I loved this movie. In Jonathan Mostow and Sam Montgomery's script he doesn't try to be stupid or a hero in some scenes. He waits for the right time to strike and behaves exactly the same way I would've done. I wasn't shouting at the screen at all. He basically reacted the way any normal or civilised person would do in my opinion. Another thing thats ingenious about the script is the unexpected twists and turns coming thick and fast making it even more suspenseful. There is not exactly a major twist at the end if thats what you're hoping for but thats not to say the movie is predictable. Its actually quite the opposite. Just when you think Kurt is getting close to getting his wife back and is winning against the bad guys he ends up having to deal with new problems getting in his way that are also plausible and realistic. In fact as the last 45 minutes progressed, I really was getting closer and closer towards the edge of my seat.To sum up, this movie is one of the best I've seen in a long, long time and it certainly blew me away in terms of what I was expecting and what I actually got in return. I was hooked from the first minute to the last and I refused to get up at at all during any scenes. A big well done to Jonathan Mostow the writer/director of this brilliant thriller and T3 which I also immensely enjoyed. I can see why he was hired for that now judging by the way he handled some of the chases in this movie. Another well done to Kurt Russell who gave a powerful and realistic performance in the lead role. A special recognition to the great villain, the late J.T Walsh who made an interesting and very unsympathetic bad guy.

The car breaks down. Amy hitches a ride with a friendly trucker (J.T. Walsh, who's magnificent as usual). When Jeff later tries to find Amy, he realizes that she's been abducted and he'll have to do whatever it takes to get her back alive and in one piece.Directed in briskly efficient fashion by Jonathan Mostow, powered along by Basil Poledouris' thundering, bone-rattling score, Doug Milesome's crisp, accomplished cinematography, and an explosive, gut-kickingly effective metal-demolishing climactic car chase, Breakdown 's basic plot liberally lifts elements from such diverse sources as Duel, The Vanishing, The Hitcher, and Road Games, but luckily what the derivative ragbag script lacks in originality is compensated for by an uncommonly spare, streamlined and unpretentious sense of lean, linear, to-the-point no-nonsense narrative economy. Characterizations are kept to a minimum (although the late, great, sorely missed Walsh, big, bad and brawny greaseball supreme M.C.

The cops can't help him and soon Jeff realises that he is alone in the face of a conspiracy that has seen his wife vanish.In a typical everyman figure in trouble plot this film produces very little in the way of substance but makes up for it with a good sense of urgency, pace and tension. The plot is a bit thin however, and some viewers may have a problem with the lack of attention to detail that niggles when you think about of the way that the film prefers to keep moving at all times rather than every stop and provide logic or explanation. Of course, the fact that it does keep moving is a strength rather than a weakness and I never found myself stopping to question it a great deal because I was quite engaged by where it was going. Of course it is all a bit lacking in substance but then it more or less makes up for it as long as you know what to expect.Russell makes for a very good everyman &#150; he is fit and together obviously but he is never a tough, action man in the way that we lose sight of his fears and anxieties. He is convincing and it is mainly his emotions that help keep the audience with him. Walsh is a solid bad guy and does well &#150; playing innocent as convincingly as he does evil; it isn't his fault that his character has zero development or backstory but his performance and the pace helps negate this to some extent. Support is good from others including Quinlan, Linn, and Gainey but really the film belongs to a sweaty and frantic Russell who gives a good performance that avoids action-hero cliché or excesses and is more convincing for it.Overall this is not the film to come to for a complex and rewarding narrative but rather one where a simple premise is run as hard and fast as it can before ending without really having ever had much in the way of substance. This is not a major problem though because, if you're in the mood for it, it is an enjoyably effective thriller.

But who can he trust.......If you can ignore the final ten minutes of this movie, which gives us an obligatory over the top action scene, this is a solid, if nuts n' bolts thriller.Russell plays the middle class Everyman who winds the locals up the wrong way on first viewing, but on second viewing, it's a plausible set up to take advantage of 'city people' taking an unknown route to reach their destination.He's a great choice for the Everyman, calm and collected at first, then bewildered and so on. It's as if we actually see him going through the stages of grief in such a short time, and he plays his character wonderfully. In fact, it's his greatest performance of the nineties.But as good as he is, it's Walsh who steals the film. The scene where he literally denies having seen Amy, when no one else is around them is truly menacing, and just shows how unhinged him and his cohorts are.But as my knowledge and cinematic intellect has changed dramatically in the eighteen years since this release, I've realised that its nothing more than a high concept straight to DVD movie that gained theatrical release because of its star power.If it were released today, it would star Cusack and Cage, and go straight to DVD and vanish without a trace. But in the late nineties, these Hitchcockian-lite thrillers were quite popular, so I can understand its success.So all in all, it's pretty well done for the first hour, the scenery is beautiful, but it loses its mojo and goes unnecessarily action packed for the finale.

Russell delivers one of his best performances as a man striving for survival while searching frantically for his wife. Quinlan is appealing in a brief role. The film all depends upon her fate and how it creates turmoil in Russell's mind. J.T. Walsh steals scenes as a trucker who may or may not be responsible for Quinlan's disappearance.

And we also appreciate one of the last - if not the last - JT Walsh performances. A real heavy, in the line of Leo Gordon or Wayne Morris. The sequence where he asks his son to protect his mother - JT Walsh's wife - although he is the real bad guy of the movie, protect his wife against the actual hero - Russel - is very unusual and also unpredictable. I loves this scene. A real must see, where, I repeat after the title of my comment, we find here some FLIGHT PLAN accents...An unforgettable film.

Breakdown begins with a couple facing problems with their car, when a trucker offers them a ride. Only the female accepts, whilst the male stays there to fix that. After that, he simply can't find her anymore. Of course there are a bunch of bandits behind this, and it is impressive to see how cold and mean they are. This great characterization of the gangster is due to great acting, along with a professional directing. Even thought I usually dislike movies involving kidnapping, mainly with action scenes, this one strongly entertained me, and 93 minutes just passed by in a minute. Breakdown leaves you in the edge of your seat, making you hate the villains very hard and cheer for the main couple, which makes it a GREAT film for all audiences.

Thus begins the adventure. The couple proceeds to a gas station and pulls up to a pump. Next the husband (Jeff) is seen approaching his jeep with the hood up and the gray pick-up in the background with the driver visible. Apparently Jeff went into the store with the hood left up. The other driver (Earl) approaches and admonishes, but there is no other confrontation. Incident closed. Later the engine gives out when the couple are driving in the desert. A tractor-trailer driver (Red) pulls up, gets out of his cab, approaches, and a bit over-friendly, suggests that the wife (Amy) accompany him to the next town, where she can contact a tow-truck operator. Indeed Amy eventually goes along, but does not return. While Jeff hangs around endlessly waiting, he notices that there is a simple wire disconnection under the engine. In a jiffy the correction is made and the husband is on his way, sans wife. His search for her is hampered by the fact that virtually no one in a jerkwater town is willing to help. A bartender, working alone (!) in a fairly busy center of activity (Belle's Diner), even pulls a pistol on him. Jeff spots Red, who turns out to be no longer friendly, and even denies that he gave Amy a lift. The small-town cop is none too bright (are they ever?). Despite the imbroglio, the husband before long, and on his own, discovers a sordid kidnapping machination. There is a race to save Amy.While the mystery maintains interest, there are some pretentious scenes. For instance, there is the bank setting where a bloodied and totally disheveled out-of-town stranger (Jeff) tries to withdraw money without causing suspicion. A viewer might infer that one of the bad guys should have cleaned him up a bit. Another is the unbelievable events that happen under the fast-moving semi. To really succeed, one would have to have nerves of steel and great physical strength, which Jeff clearly does not possess based upon earlier scenes. In the end, there is the antagonist, mortally wounded and lying flat after taking a tremendous fall from a bridge. Even though he has probably broken nearly all of the 29 bones in his cranium, a protagonist releases a tractor hanging from the side of the bridge to REALLY crush the bad guy, to ensure his perdition.Then again, one cannot deny the picture's positive points. It does move along very well, and the acting is fine. The kitchen setting is quite tense, and viewers may wonder how the protagonist can get out of that quandary. Certainly exciting is the road chase and climax. And how can anyone not like the cinematography / Utah-Nevada scenery? Over all, the movie is worth watching. Hang onto those seats while you enjoy the end-ride.

Mostow maintains relative realism until the over the top finale, and thanks to the sharp script and efficient direction we are treated to a pacey film with a couple of bona fide sweaty palm scenes. Keeping the heart rate up is Basil Poledouris' typically pounding, moody score which is surprisingly effective.Kurt Russell makes you both believe and sympathise with Jeff Taylor, the man desperately searching for his wife who accepted a ride with an apparently friendly trucker and never came back. His good showing is supported well by J T Walsh who plays the two-faced owner of the eighteen wheeler, Red Barr. Kathleen Quinlan, as said wife Amy, and the rest of the cast do little.Two real pluses are the fact that this unrelenting film is short (smart editing) and it features fantastic cinematography from Doug Milsome, who captures America's Southwest brilliantly.Saturday, October 25, 1997 - Village Centre MelbourneThis slick 90's action flick is pure Hollywood. It is very interesting to compare the obvious, blatant style of this film to the previous picture I watched, The Apartment.Unlike his French counterpart, Jonathan Mostow scraps subtlety and slight of hand for a more direct approach. You never have to guess who the bad guy is, and there is no ambiguity to baffle the audience. Even so, this approach is effective at the level it was intended to be in Breakdown.Kurt Russell is convincingly frantic as Jeff Taylor, a man whose desperate search for his wife turns into a fatal game of life and death. As the sinister Red Barr, J. T. Walsh has a great time, while Kathleen Quinlan does well with the little screen time she has.Equally effective is Doug Milsome's cinematography and Basil Poledouris' pounding score. All rounded off with a typical over the top finale. Even my wife, never the cynic, was rolling her eyes at the the conclusion of this one.Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video "},{"Title":"Who can you trust?","Date":"27 June 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  BreakdownJeff (Kurt Russell) and his wife, Amy (Kathleen Qinlan) take the scenic route to where they are going.

Kurt Russell plays a husband who gets on the wrong side of a group of hillbilly rednecks with a very disturbing plan.While on a drive to Los Angeles to begin their new lives, Russel and Quinlan drive along the sandy roads of America's deserts and they almost crash into a truck pulling into the road. This is the beginning of a series of events in which Quinlan is kidnapped, Russell hunted down and shot at and lots more. This sounds trivial and predictable, and in a way it is. But Mostow manages to pace the story so well, that you are constantly on the edge of your seat waiting for what happens next and how the heck Russell is going to get himself out of the next situation. This makes up for some of the flaws that the movie has.Kurt Russell is not one to deliver top-notch acting performances, he is the reason I waited so long to see this movie. I wouldn't believe that he could carry this movie on his own. But he does, he is excellent as the city slicker who is blackmailed to get his wife back. He portrays him and his transformation into the man who takes control fine. Way above my expectations. Quinlan, although her role is fairly small, delivers the goods as the abducted wife. She makes us root for Russell to get her back. The baddies are all too believable. They are the bunch of rednecks you wouldn't want to meet in the first place, but you probably have when you have been driving across America. It's a scary thought that when you are driving in an expensive car you automatically become a target for folks like these, cold chills down my spine.This certainly is up there in my chiller top ten.

Now picture that the couple is Jeff and Amy Taylor(Kurt Russell & Kathleen Quinlan), and they're taking the scenic route from Boston to San Diego. They nearly hit a dirty black pickup truck and then stop for gas. They are confronted by the driver and at that point the suspense slowly starts building. Then trying to distance themselves from the pickup, they crank there brand new SUV up to full speed and drive away. But since its a new car it overheats and breaks down. Then a friendly truck driver comes along offering to give them a lift to Belle's Diner where they can call a tow truck. Amy takes the ride while Jeff stays with the car. After a while Jeff gets the car working and goes to Belle's. When arrives he is informed no one there has ever heard of his wife.  From that point on the suspense hits full blast as every scene is used to pump every last bit of suspense out of it. Eventhough the storyline is nothing original and just sounds like a changed version of The Vanishing(1988 one not the remake) and the characters are quite thin this movie is still unbearably suspenseful. Jonathan Mostow the director borrows from a number of movies quite heavily. You have the crazy truck driver from Duel, the psycho hillbilly's from Deliverance and the missing wife from The Vanishing.   What makes this movies so much better than the countless other missing-wife thrillers is first of all Jeff doesn't seem like a Schwarzenegger or Stallone and we really do believe this is all happening to him. As played by Kurt Russell Jeff is like Jon Voight's character in Deliverance, at first scared and by end he is pushed to fight back. Kurt Russell really makes Jeff a believable character because you could tell that the fear is for real and that the sweat is real. Another plus in Breakdown is how real the villains seem. It seems that they have other lives and at no point do we doubt that they mean business.  The only real letdown this movies has is the ending, which I won't describe for those who haven't seen the movie. But just to say the ending changes pace from the rest of the movie.

Having overshot the turn off, it was, needless to say, a little tense as we searched for our oil-splattered destination. To cut a long story short, we found the gas station and all was well.Most drivers have been in the same situation at some point on the road It's the middle of nowhere, you're lost, eyes fixed to the petrol gauge wondering if it's possible to make it to the next services without being stranded. With such a primal fear bubbling in every driver's psyche, it's little wonder canny film-makers have been keen to exploit this. Many have been keen to try with a host of TV movies usually starring Robert Urich and Meredith Baxter Birney, credibility often taking a back seat to the cliched scripts.However, while those are best forgotten, there are three great movies about highway horror that usually involve something a little more sinister than just looking for gas in the middle of a dust-laden desert.Steven Spielberg directed the first, Duel, in the early Seventies; a terrific thriller with Dennis Weaver as a humble motorist terrorised by an unhinged trucker (who we never see).The second was The Vanishing, George Sluizer's Dutch nail-biter about a young man desperately searching for his girlfriend after she disappears from a motorway service station.Taking elements from both of the above, writer/director Jonathan Mostow created the third Breakdown, an all too feasible thriller which rarely shifts out of top gear - until the third act. In the early days of production, things didn't look promising. Kurt Russell had just made the derivative yawnfest Escape From LA and Mostow's previous movies, Beverly Hills Bodysnatchers and Flight of the Black Angel, were far from classics.To say both director and star pulled out all the stops is something of an understatement. Breakdown may not be in the same league as The Sixth Sense or The World is Not Enough - the finale is more than a little disappointing - but as a simple thriller, well told, this is a breathless trip to Hell and back.Russell plays Jeff Taylor, the everyman motorist on a trip from Boston to San Diego with wife Amy (Kathleen Quinlan). After breaking down in the middle of nowhere, she (rather stupidly) goes off with trucker JT Walsh to get help. When his photogenic partner doesn't return, Kurt naturally smells a rat and is soon neck deep in trouble in an attempt to rescue his beloved. While Russell is as good as ever, risking life and limb as the man who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, it's the late, great JT Walsh who shines in one of his final performances. Hollywood psychos are two a penny in Tinseltown so to effectively play a man who is clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic without looking like a Scooby Doo villain takes some doing. As Walsh proved with movies such as The Negotiator, Hollywood lost a superb supporting star the day he died.

Kurt Russell does a fine job playing a character who is scared, but who has hidden reserves of strength to call upon when the chips are down.  Kathleen Quinlan has moments of greatness too.  In particular I noticed that it was she who watched the black pick-up to make sure it went away near the beginning.  Her husband had already turned back to their car, but she was the one who wanted to be sure that the threat had totally vanished.There are three road movies which I can watch over and over again - Duel The Hitcher and now Breakdown.  I can recommend all equally. "},{"Title":"Great thriller","Date":"6 October 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I really liked this movie.

The ominous feeling of utter suspense and the overwhelming initial paranoia grabbed me from the onset, as Rusell came head to head with a local redneck when he nearly collided with him. The eerie desert setting of Utah coupled with the nice shiny new car which contrasted against the rough country with its rough redneck cafés and gas stops created an atmosphere of deep vulnerability and foreboding. The couple's quiet and ordinary existence contrasted harshly with the atmosphere of the unfriendly people and surroundings. Kurt Russell was a brilliant depiction of the average man in a situation where his wife has accepted a lift with a trucker when his car breaks down, and she does not appear at the truck stop they arranged to meet at. His reaction as the realisation dawned was brilliantly realistic and this drew you into the movie which despite a plot which some say has become too common, the movie was from then on never predictable. Russell's realism and humanity was so lifelike that it made you deeply fearful when he decided to pursue his wife and the kidnappers and made you cheer whenever things went slightly his way. The suspense built up like a thunderstorm with a climactic ending, with some of the most thrilling sequences of car-chases ever filmed. Ruussell as a hero in this picture, is so much more grabbing because the movie paints a picture of what would happen in the real world in a situation like this, and it is actually feasible too, there may have been the odd scene which slipped on this but this movie is so gripping because for the hero, his fix and his choices certainly aren't cut & dry, things don't always go right, as they do for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Clint Eastwood. For a thriller in the 90's, it doesn't get much better than this!

The movie focuses on how the lead Kurt Russell (underrated in my view) loses his wife after they break down in a backward US town and how the locals are potentially involved. Breakdown is a thriller despite what may sound as a recipe for another teen horror slasher with crazed cannibal murderers who wield axes, chainsaws or funny laughs. The villains whilst driven by greed as opposed to insanity are truly evil and the late JT Walsh successfully conjures up a strong hatred from the viewer. Breakdown is a simple thriller that is not overtly ambitious in plot development, action sequences or special effects. It relies on its characters, a fast pace that keeps viewer interest from start to finish and a sense of tension. Strong performances from all leading characters, careful direction and good plot development combine to create what the viewer perceives as a realistic sequence of events that is all the more horrifying since one continuously can put themselves in Russell's shoes. Acting Chameleon Russell is successful in depicting your average Joe facing a desperate situation. The viewer has a natural affinity for his character and he delivers another good performance. Breakdown is one of the few thrillers that actually works given its acting performances, plot development, pace and its ability to stick to what keeps the viewer interested whilst not being overly ambitious. The director (John Mostow) went on to direct Terminator 3 for which he is likely to burn in hell.

Why? Because the characters choose appropriate actions based on their motives. Here's a few examples(Spoilers ahead)When Kurt Russell confronts the guy in the truck at the gas station in the very beginning, and his wife asks him what who he was, in a bad movie he would have said no one. Here he explains that it was the same guy from before, which makes sense.It doesn't make sense at first when Russell refuses the ride from the trucker, but it is subtly revealed that he doesn't want to leave his car alone. This leads to his wife going off alone, but only after she forces the issue. Russell's motivations here make perfect sense for his actions. After Russell tapes up the bad guy and is pulled over by the cop, in a bad movie he would have put his gun in the cop's face and tied him up too. Instead, he surrendered and asked for help, just like a reasonable person would. When Russell latches onto the back of JT Walsh's truck, there's a dramatic sequence where he clings to the bottom of the truck as he makes his way to the front. In a bad movie, this would have led to him climbing into the cab, wresting control of the truck and forcing Walsh to reveal the location of his wife. Instead, he was taking the sensible and important step of getting to a safe and comfortable place to spend the hours-long ride. Throughout the movie, Russell tries to call for help. In most movies like this, if an attempt is even made to actually use the police, they are invariably disdainful of strangers, in on it, or both. In the brief period where Russell thinks the cops are in on it, he tries to reach an FBI agent. Apart from the period immediately after the cop got shot, he constantly tries to get police help, just like a thinking human being would.These and many other small things are examples of the screenwriters giving characters reasonable motives in unreasonable situations and allowing the action to unfold. In too many action movies the main character forces the plot with completely irrational behavior. The main character here reacts to the plot evenly with the audience, and it makes him a much more sympathetic hero than the typical action movie.

It can't be easy to create tension, and indeed many thrillers fail miserably at it; but this one honestly is a thrill ride from start to finish and once Mostow has implemented the tense atmosphere, the audience isn't allowed to breathe calmly again until the end credits role; and that really is what you want from a film like this! The film takes obvious influence from desert road thrillers such as The Hitcher and Duel and adds in a little organised crime, as we follow a married couple on a road trip through the desert. The trip turns awry when their car breaks down, and after a truck pulls up to help; the husband finds himself in a world of turmoil when his wife goes missing after taking a ride with the trucker. Nobody seems to have seen her; just how do you locate a missing person in the middle of nowhere? This sort of movie doesn't usually give its stars much to do, but the amazingly talented Kurt Russell takes what he's been given and moulds a very real character out of it. The early exchanges between him and his wife are good and show that the film isn't just about car chases and shootouts. Russell does well in ensuring that his character is always vulnerable and a million miles away from his all action characters in films such as Escape from New York. He is joined by talented support from the likes of Kathleen Quinlan, Jack Noseworthy and J.T. Walsh; all of which excel in their respective roles. The action is clichéd, but the director ensures that it all feels very fresh as everything is delivered with panache and great excitement. There are a number of car chases and scenes that see the lead character in peril, and it's easy to put yourself in his place thanks to Kurt Russell's performance. It's true that this film is, in essence, just a good excuse to while away ninety minutes of your time; but Breakdown is better than many films of its kind, and if you're looking for thrills; you'll find them here!

There's also the comedy or action role he has taken part in that people remember him for fondly for. And then there's Kurt Russell's thriller side of films, where he plays an ordinary man caught in extremely dangerous situations that could happen in the real world.

Written by Sam Montgomery and Jonathan Mostow (who also directed), this thriller is tense all the way although it becomes more fictitious as it goes on, it still is a thriller that crosses the boundaries of how plausible this situation actually is.The acting is one of the strongest parts to this story. Although Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan do not have much screen time together, they feel like an authentic couple. J.T. Walsh as the passerby truck driver is also convincing in his performance for the character that he plays. There's also other roles played by other known actors like M.C. Gainey, Jack Noseworthy and Rex Linn as the town police officer. The only part of the writing that doesn't work in favor of the actors is the story's predictability. There really is no surprise. The trailer to the film alone allows some spoilers to slide. But even without viewing the trailer, the execution itself reveals its hand a little early. As to whether the secret was supposed to be kept hidden is unknown but again, it is rather obvious. The bigger question that'll linger on the audiences' mind is what's going on. This is the second strongest element to the film - tension.As the film progresses, small clue tidbits are given to the audience as to possible outcomes of what happened to Jeff's wife. With that, there's only so many solutions one can create to try understand the problem. Without the audience exactly knowing what happened to Jeff's wife is a great way to get the viewers' imaginations to run wild with thought. This is exactly why this thriller is so much scarier than running into the Sawyer family from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) (although it does have small traces of influence). The fact that several people everyday go missing is much more realistic than crossing paths with a chainsaw wielding cannibal, is why this hits closer to home; just like the movie's tagline, It Could Happen to You. To assume any normal human being would want to be captured would be absolutely insane. Besides, if you wanted to be captured, then you're really not being captured as definition claims the action to be.Thankfully, along with the high tension come some worthy retaliation scenes that involve fighting back. Of course, if you want the protagonist to get what they want, it's going to be fun watching those scenes. Who doesn't like watching antagonists getting what they deserve? The cinematography is a nice addition as well. Handled by Douglas Milsome (Full Metal Jacket (1987)), numerous shots contain what they need to show; barren rock land,...better known as isolation. Yet as gloomy as the setting feels, it is quite beautiful to look at. Bright clear sunny skies, mountain ranges in the background and a single road highway. Definitely a different setting than your usual urban territory. Finally the music composed by Basil Poledouris (best known for his work on RoboCop (1987) and RoboCop 3 (1993)) was decently constructed. There's no recognizable main theme but Poledouris includes a number of tracks that emphasize the bleak emptiness that is the desert area of North America. Even so, his tracks that involve fighting are also well made too. All around, an intense watch.It has a bit of mystery in its story but much of that is revealed way at the beginning. However with chilling storytelling that concentrates on how it could happen to the person watching it, the events that occur are scary at times. The acting is solid, the music sounds organic and the camera-work looks great; all of which keep the tension high the whole time.

In the western man was master of this world, here witless noir pawn. The suggestion is that everything might have been okay had he not stepped on the gas too hard because he panicked, the anxiety causing the breakdown. But this is soon abandoned for ordinary schemes where the fragility of that modern life is exposed by having it so easily exploited as someone reaching under the hood of a car and snapping two wires that held it together. It is still his suburban nightmare of having lost his wife and not having enough money in that Boston bank account to get her back with because he paid for the fancy car but now we have petty conmen looking for just money and everything clear and simple.So this is one of those films where you can see the wonderful ambiguities of noir being supplanted by a simple traction, another is Lethal Weapon. First the thriller and then action mechanics. By the end it's silly and straightforward, the sole reason not to turn it off being that you might want to see people avoid being run over by a truck or hang from a bridge.

In that film the fiancé of a man is abducted from a roadside stop, leading to his frantic 3 year search and public campaign to find out what happened to her. It is a haunting tale of loss and random evil, mixed in with obsessive guilt and fixation. By watching Breakdown and Spoorloos you can see the difference between the European genre of exposing human frailties, without redemption, and the American genre of righteous retribution. The American film is by far the less intriguing.. being no more than a little nuanced potboiler of good over evil, with the usual facile stereotypes you find in Hollywood films, and of course, car chase. Spoorloos delves into the complexities of the human condition Breakdown can only poorly imitate.

Stopping at the nearest gas station Jeff is confronted by the truck driver Earl, M.C. Gainey who calls him a rotten driver and worse.Trying to avoid any trouble with Earl Jeff takes his insults and walks away from him. Unknown to both Jeff and Amy is that their being set up to be kidnapped robbed and murdered by a ruthless gang of criminals. This gang of murderous cutthroats work the desert highways picking off unsuspected motorists with out of state license plates, Jeff's van has Massachusetts plates, who will not be missed long enough until the gang gets away with their crime. Earl unhooked the wiring of Jeff's van when he and Amy were in the gas station getting something to eat. Later as they were driving in the empty desert their van broke-down. All of a sudden a friendly trucker Red Barr,J.T. Walsh, pulls up offering to help. Red tells Jeff and Amy that the closest place where they can call for assistance is 60 miles away at the Belle's Diner. Amy decides to go with the helpful Red to the diner while Jeff choose to stay with the van until help arrived. Finding out what's wrong with the van and fixing it Jeff drives to the Belle's Diner only to find out that his wife Amy and the friendly trucker were never there! As the befuddled Jeff start to look for Amy it seems like she just vanished off the face of the earth. Good action drama set in the middle of the Arizona/Nevada desert with a gripping performance by Kurt Russell as a man driven from being peaceful and reasonable to a desperate and no holds bar individual. Searching of his missing wife Jeff battles with the gang who kidnapped her with nobody around to help or believe him. Jeff tracking down the gang of kidnappers and finding his wife the movie then goes into high octane action that includes an incredible car chase scene with Jeff and Amy hemmed in from both sides by two cars of the kidnappers while Red is using his 18 wheeler to slam Jeff's car from behind like a battling ram. J.T Walsh steals the acting honors with his Doc. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde performance as Red Barr. We see Red go from a friendly and helpful good Samaritan into a brutal kidnap-murderer and he does it so convincingly that it's hard to believe that he's the same person in both roles. The look on Red's face that changes from family man to psycho-killer at the dinner table, when he was confronted by Jeff, was so startling as well as demonic that it made the hair on my back stand on it's ends. Tremendous ending sequence with the aforementioned car case culminating with a heart-stopping cliff or to be more accurate bridge hanging ending. Red in the end get pulverized in what would give the definition of the word overkill a whole new meaning. "},{"Title":"TERRIFIC movie!!!

Anyway, the important thing here is the film.  And even Kurt Russell's rudimentary, over-the-top characterization couldn't mar this climactic gem for me.  Let me put it this way.  The movie was so great that I was shocked I had never heard of it before.  Was it snubbed by the critics or just not marketed very well?  The suspense begins soon after the opening credits, and every few minutes, when you feel that a bit of relief is warranted, the suspense clamps down hard and urgent once more.  It's very, VERY effective as a suspense film.  In fact, to use a phrase that is, admittedly, a Hollywood cliche, I was definitely on the edge of my seat for the entire running time of the picture.  You find yourself immediately put in the place of the lead character, whether you want to be there or not, you can't help it.  Maybe Kurt Russell delivered in this movie afterall?!  I think so.  The action sequences are believable, gripping, and beautifully filmed.  They also have an element of realism that may be a factor in the film's ability to make you a part of the story.  What comes to my mind during the desert driving scenes and the chases is that old road-rage classic, Duel.  If you enjoy a taut, exciting thriller (and who doesn't?!), you should definitely pick this one up.

In fact, the plot was reasonably good and most the loose ends were tied up well.I guess I never really felt much for the characters.  The bad guys seemed so gratuitously evil that I couldn't associate with them enough to really hate them, and Kurt Russell seemed to be so in control of the situation ('oh, ok, so I've lost my gun... well I'm sure I'll improvise something') that it was difficult to feel he was in any real danger at any point.  The only character I felt any empathy for was the police officer, who, despite being an incidental character, seemed to be a real, fallible human being.The suspense scenes were spoiled by the unbelievability of the situation - especially the cliff-hanger at the very end, and the preceding take-'em-out-one-at-a-time car chase.  Instead of being a life-or-death situation, it ends up as 'if that were the real world he would be dead by now, so the script obviously says he's going to survive this one' - there's nothing to keep you on the edge of the seat.Sorry to anyone who really liked this film... don't let my comments ruin your enjoyment of it.

Get it at Amazon.)What we have here is a breakdown in probability, which is an advance on the usual thriller development, which is a breakdown in logic (although there's enough of that too). We also have the most incredible heroics known to human kind performed by Kurt Russell in the rescue of his wife, such heroics as would make Superman turn as green as kryptonite in envy.Psychologically this is another yuppie nightmare to engage the fancy betwixt the consommé and the brie. Upscale young couple from Massachusetts driving to California get targeted in the redneck desert by some degenerate locals. First their shiny new Jeep Cherokee just stops running out in the middle of nowhere. Then the wife (Kathleen Quinlan) disappears after accepting a ride from a trucker (J.T. Walsh) who then denies he ever saw her. It's hard for hubby Kurt Russell to understand what's going on. Did J.T. kill her? Was it a sex crime? Next Russell himself is waylaid, but fear not. Our hero, now properly worked up, escapes, and against all odds, and I mean all odds, fights his way into the chase. We soon see that these evil guys are evil to the very core of their being. At one point they put Quinlan in the freezer, after she's already had a bad day and night tied up with tape over her mouth in a mummy's shroud stuffed into a side storage compartment of a traveling truck. They shut the freezer, lock the storm shelter door, lock the barn door and go to breakfast where, with hardy appetites, they swap stories and make merry.Remember the old cowboy bit where Roy Rogers or Tom Mix crawls under the stage coach as the horses are galloping under the whip of the driver, and manages to climb up the side of the coach as the dust flies to emerge at shotgun position to fight the villain holding the reigns? Well, we've got the same thing here, only Kurt Russell with arms of steel and strength to shame Mighty Mouse, climbs under the roaring truck doing seventy MPH over the asphalt and emerges behind the cab where he endures a twelve-hour drive to later position himself to fight the villains. The man's will and fortitude are the envy of the known universe. Actually I laughed out loud at the absurdity of the some of the heroics.The crash scenes sparkle, but the pièce de résistance is the final scene with the sixteen wheeler hanging precariously off the bridge above a rocky canyon stream WAY BELOW with Russell and Walsh crawling over it like ants as they try to murder one another.At points I was reminded of the seminal Spielberg TV flick, Duel, in the use of the menacing truck, while the isolated and inbred western locale trapping our couple recalled to mind Oliver Stone's U Turn.Incidentally, the map shown beneath the opening credits is fake there is no such configuration of roads and towns in the United States.

Throughout the years those types of movies have been released and I can not remember if any of them thrilled me as much as this one did. I've seen Vacancy yesterday night on theater, hoping that it was presenting what it promises, but unfortunately I was frustrated at the end once again. All thriller movies try to get audience to where they feel stranded, however not so many movies of Hollywood in recent years accomplished this goal as much as Breakdown did.Kurt Russel is an amazing actor. He does an excellent job considering the situation he was in. From the beginning to the end, he plays the desperate husband who tries to get back his wife with no help from anybody in the middle of nowhere. But my two thumbs were up for J.T.Walsh who played an excellent role as the villain. I like Hannibal Lecter (ranked #1 in AFI's List of the 50 winning villains) as a good bad character however compared to Warren 'Red' Barr, he is just a little girl playing hide & seek in kindergarten. This character is so well played, I even couldn't help myself strangle the pillow until it pops while I was watching him, and he truly succeeded to jar on my nerves.The script is so well organized that it holds you from the start and never lets go until the end.

He really conveys an emotional charged performance. Forgive me for my excessive use of the word intense, but that's just what he is. He just comes unglued in this film, seemingly on the verge of having a break-down himself.

I'm not convinced, for example, that Kathleen Quinlan's character would leave her husband (Kurt Russell) so readily.  I can certainly understand her desire to avoid being stranded in the desert all day beside a broken car; but I would never regard a hitchhike with a strange trucker as a preferable alternative!The explanation, of course, is that she's naïve, a trait that would be more convincing if she were a teenage girl or young woman; but the movie clearly establishes her as a woman in her 30s, the type of person I would never imagine making the kind of decision she does.  And I don't understand why she'd be willing to leave Russell alone in the middle of nowhere.Another moment that doesn't quite convince me occurs when Russell confronts the trucker (J.T. Walsh) who gave his wife a ride, and the trucker completely denies giving the wife a ride or ever seeing Russell or his wife before.  Certainly this is the movie's most memorably chilling moment, and yet it's just not believable in any context.Walsh's complete denial is such a transparent lie that it provokes immediate suspicion and hostility from Russell, convincing him that something terrible has already happened to his wife.  There is no room left for doubt or suspense Walsh is obviously lying, and doing it very poorly.  Wouldn't the movie have been much more plausible (and chilling) if Walsh had been able to convince Russell that nothing had happened?My favorite moment occurs when the sheriff suggests to Russell that his wife may have intentionally left him the idea that Russell might never have known his wife as well as he believed is extremely intriguing; and if Breakdown had developed in this direction, and shown Russell doubting himself as much as everyone else, it would have been a thriller worthy of Hitchcock.But this is an action movie, and writer/director Mostow was trying to emulate Duel and Deliverance rather than Vertigo or The Vanishing; but his premise is so compelling that I wish he had developed it in a more interesting and less formulaic direction.Breakdown starts to go downhill as Russell's SUV does to avoid spoilers, I'll just say that he drives his SUV into a river.  I don't know what Russell was trying to accomplish by doing this, since he makes his situation worse rather than better (watch the movie and you'll understand what I mean).Most ordinary people in Russell's situation (and Russell is allegedly an ordinary person) would drown, be swept downstream and smashed onto sharp rocks, or meet a terrible end by various other means.  After a while, though, Russell begins to resemble a Saturday matinee serial hero (or a video-game protagonist), and not like the real person he was at the beginning of the movie!Again, I want to avoid spoilers, so I'll just say that after a while Breakdown seems to have no originality left, and becomes familiar, derivative, and indistinguishable from countless made-for-HBO action movies. To be fair, it is entertaining and gripping for quite a while, though in retrospect its second act relies heavily on clichés, such as a guy who is shot and appears dead but is not really dead, and others that I dare not mention.An hour into the movie, Russell performs a feat so completely unbelievable that it's worth mentioning.  It's not a spoiler, because the back of every Breakdown DVD and videotape shows it Russell climbs up the side of a moving truck, looking more like Indiana Jones and less like the average guy he's supposed to be.No ordinary guy, without camera tricks and stunt doubles, would be able to do what Russell does.  Film critic Leonard Maltin asserts that Breakdown contains all-too-believable situations.  Well, Russell's sequence on the truck is not one of them!  Most people who attempted Russell's feat (on Fear Factor, perhaps) would be neatly pressed between truck tires and highway asphalt.The major letdown of Breakdown is the anticlimactic final sequence, which I won't spoil except to say that it's completely incoherent and completely unnecessary.  Breakdown might have been better had it simply ended with the confrontation in the previous scene; but it persists in ending on a ridiculous note, which I can only describe as a fight atop a truck that conveniently (and absurdly) ignores Newton's theory of gravity.The final fight would have been appropriate in Rambo 4, Die Hard 4, Mad Max 4, or even a Coyote and Roadrunner cartoon, but it isn't appropriate in this movie.  I don't want to risk a spoiler by revealing the outcome, although it is completely predictable.  After watching it, I supposed that Mostow could be the right guy to direct Terminator 3.Russell, Quinlan, and Walsh do far more for the movie than it does for them; in fact, it's entertaining only because of their combined star power. Breakdown is a good movie with a bad ending, or a bad movie with a good beginning; I can't decide.  It's never boring, but after the first half hour it never reaches its potential.Rating 6  "},{"Title":"well-made","Date":"28 February 2002","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Gripping, skillful thriller from director Jonathan Mostow takes a simple premise and effectively expands it into an entertaining movie.

The premise was exciting but the storyline never brings us on surprising grounds. Scenes pile up to build a consistent yet lame story from the nice but already heavy Shining-inspired opening credits down to the final and over-the-top cliffhanger.Redeeming features first and foremost Kurt Russell floats this very forgettable (even disposable) movie and make it watchable. Jonathan Mostow's directing also creates inner dynamics within his own flatly episodic story. Eventually stunts are good but that's what you're bound to demand from a movie where action is the last refuge to make up for the overall lack of creativity. Breakdown wants so much to cash in on action sequences planted here and there in the storyline that stunts occur like the climax of those sequences, ridiculously closing an uninteresting boxing fight with a wrestling tour-de-force.If you want to make a thriller, action cannot compensate for the lack of tension; and if you don't have the budget to make a big fat action movie stunt acts will soon look the same or overstretched. That's the big problem here Breakdown was meant to be a thriller driving to its conclusion with brawn. In fact it gently drives along this straight line across the desert, slowly at first to create tension (i.e. at least some expectations) then aims to shake the audience, alternatively going full throttle then screeching to a halt. That's very cheap and lame.

Your 4x4 has broken down, and you're sitting on the side of the road, looking at the vehicle's engine, and nothing looks wrong. Your wife is in the passenger seat, anxious to get going. You're in the middle of nowhere, and that can be pretty scary. Then a truck comes your way, and the driver offers you and your wife a ride. You say you're going to stay with the Jeep, but your wife goes with the truck driver, who's going to drop her off at a bar up the road. You say thanks, and she's on her way before you can stop it.Back at the car you find that a wire underneath has been cut. You twist them together and the engine starts. You're elated; you climb in the front and pull away to drive off into the distance to pick up your wife.You arrive at the bar, and walk inside. Your wife isn't there. The bartender is of no help, and he won't even let you look at the orders for the day. You ask everyone there if they've seen a woman in a white blouse, but none of them seem to care. They ignore you. Frantically you track down the truck who picked your wife up earlier and run it off the road. You call a policeman, and he searches the truck.Your wife isn't there, and the truck driver doesn't remember you at all. You know it's the guy, and the truck, but the cop lets him drive away. And so you are left stranded in the middle of the road with your vehicle, not sure what to do. So you try to track down your wife.So that's never happened to you? Good. But in Breakdown, Jonathan Mostow's thriller about paranoia, it happens to Kurt Russell's character, and he is left Frantic and in The Game of life.Those quotes up there are in reference to Roman Polanski's 1998 paranoia thriller Frantic about Harrison Ford losing his wife in Paris; The Game is David Fincher's dark and broody paranoia thriller from 1997.You see, Breakdown is much like those two films. It probably borrows from Frantic a bit, and I would give it a higher rating than Frantic because it is so expertly-crafted, but the end quickly turns into a kind of ridiculous stunt ride rather than a smart and intelligent thriller.The whole way through, the film is amazingly realistic and scary and tense and chilling and paranoid and frantic, but then the end, as I said above, ruins the whole thing! It's stupid, and a mess. You feel like slapping Jonathan Mostow for ruining an otherwise above-average thriller. And two things about the ending don't work. One, the ridiculous car chase; two, as Ebert noted in his review (major spoiler ahead), killing villians is usually something the heroes do in a moment of self-defense, but Russell kills the truck driver after he (the truck driver) is already paralyzed and lying on a rock one hundred feet below. How's that for grisly? Ebert said the audience in the theater did not cheer, which proves that there is still decency in America's modern audience. I don't really care about killing the driver, but the chase scene was a waste of time and the buildup to it was ten times better.But if you flip off the film before the last five minutes, you're sure to have a wildly fun time; it's an intense thriller that leaves you gasping for air. The suspense just builds more and more every minute, and we can identify with Russell's character very much.The world seems to be completely calm and the fact that no one really seems to care about his wife makes him even the more frantic. I like to think that's what Russell's character feels like after he finds out his wife is missing and realizes no one is doing anything about it but himself. I get that feeling sometimes, whether it's over losing something small or big. No one seems to care anymore these days, and that's more startling, to Russell, than the fact that his wife is missing at all.3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer  "},{"Title":"Nervous Takedown","Date":"17 April 1999","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Breakdown seems to have slipped through the cracks over the years. It was a Number 1 hit when released in theatres in May 1997, though, bizarrely, it took a whole year to reach the UK when I saw it in May 1998. Kind of odd for a successful film with a big-name star. Produced and financed by Dino DeLaurentis, Breakdown was released by Paramount in the US and Fox in the UK. I guess the rights are stuck in a loophole, it's the only reason I can think of as to why it's currently out-of-print.Kurt Russell is Jeff Taylor, a man traveling across America with his hot wife. In the last leg of their Boston-San Diego move, their car freezes-up and stops dead by the road. A friendly trucker offers them help. Hot wife goes off with him to get a tow-truck. She doesn't return. Jeff, panic increasing by the second, tracks down the trucker, Warren 'Red' Barr (played by the late JT Walsh), but the man denies ever meeting him or his wife. Panic turns to anger, and anger turns to terror, as Jeff is hurled into a kidnap/ransom plot. With no one to turn to for help he has to use his wits and rely on chance to turn the tables on the bad guys.At a stripped-down, incredibly terse 93 minutes, Breakdown wastes no time with long set-ups. There are no long speeches, no unnecessary deviations, just action and suspense. Kurt Russell carries much of the film with facial expressions. Though I have to say I wish Jonathan Mostow kept a tighter reign on his acting, as he tend to overdo it a bit. Plus some of his dialogue is repetitive and clichéd. Yes, there are a few plot holes and gaps in the logic (the useless cop cliché really gets on my nerves) but at such a brisk pace the film doesn't have time to dwell on them.With shades of Duel, Deliverance, and the Vanishing, Breakdown offers a few exciting car chases, lonely desert locations, and one hell of an evil villain. If you can find it, don't hesitate to invest the time and money.

Not that that is so strange. I don't think it has ever made it to the cinema over here and since there are so many movies released every year, it isn't very difficult to miss one so now and then. But that didn't bother me. When I read in a magazine that this was a thriller with Kurt Russell, I decided to tape it so I could watch it on a lazy afternoon.When Jeff and Amy Taylor must drive across the country because they are moving to California, everything seems to go perfect in their brand new car. Until somewhere in the middle of the desert they almost hit a pick-up truck with a couple of rednecks in it. That's when they decide it's time to take a little break at the next gas station. Here they meet the same guys again and it doesn't take long before they have an argument with the driver. They decide to continue their journey and try to forget about it, but when all a sudden their car breaks down and they see the same pick-up passing by and turning around, they are scared. But they are lucky because at the same moment a truck stops near them, chasing away those rednecks. The trucker offers to bring them to the next diner where they can call a tow truck, but Jeff decides to stay with his car and lets his wife leave, alone with the trucker. When Jeff is able to fix his car all by himself and drives to the diner, his wife is missing and there is no-one who has ever seen her or the truck, let alone that they would know where he should look for her...In my opinion the pace of this movie is the best that it has to offer, because it doesn't leave you the time to think too much or to question certain parts. The entire movie roles by like a race car and that's a good thing, because when you start thinking about it, there hasn't been payed a lot attention to certain details. But as I said, it didn't bother me all that much, because there was so much going on all the time that you could easily forget about it. And I must say, overall this is a very good story. OK, I'm not saying that it happens every day that someone who's car broke down in the middle of nowhere is immediately kidnapped, but overall the story is good. Only the ending is too much for me. The entire plot lacked substance and was packed with unbelievable action shots. I mean, that Jeff Taylor all a sudden turned from a grey city-slicker into superman, capable of handling guns, driving like a stuntman, performing other dangerous stunts,... I just didn't buy that one anymore. And that's too bad, because until then I really appreciated this movie, also thanks to the decent performances of Kurt Russell, Kathleen Quinlan and especially J.T. Walsh and M.C. Gainey (who were in my opinion the two best actors in this movie).Overall, Breakdown isn't a bad movie and if only it had had a more believable ending, I would have loved it. The acting and the rest of the story are certainly OK, but it's the ending that spoiled a lot of my fun, because I just couldn't believe in it anymore. That's why I give this movie a rating in between 6/10 and 6.5/10. That's still not bad, but it isn't great either.

The terrific music score really pounds home all the tension but this film works so well in large part to the performances. Russell, in my opinion, is one of the most under appreciated actors in the past thirty years and once again turns in a terrific performance and really nails the torture this husband is going through. The panic and fear that Russell displays is very realistic and you can't help but feel he's actually going through this stuff. Walsh, another underrated character actor, is equally good just because of how cold he is. When the film was released Roger Ebert and several others brought up some controversy due to the ending and its message of morals. I won't ruin the ending here but I didn't have a problem with how it ended. The screenplay by director Mostow is extremely well written and has you biting your nails the entire way and thankfully offers up smart characters.

Its believability goes way down when, for example, Kurt Russell rides on the bottom of a moving truck trailer and easily finds his way up to the cab. There are obvious continuity and other errors here a villain gets a brutal rifle blast to his shoulder, but a few minutes later he's driving a car with no visible problems; a small child is shown playing video games (so it's early evening), but a few minutes later in the same scene dawn breaks.About the only entertainment here is the acting of J.T. Walsh and M.C. Gainey, who are caricatures but fun ones. Kurt Russell, on the other hand, acts like he's not particularly happy to have taken this role, and is just going through the motions until he gets his paycheck.I must say that the purported message, if any, of this film is intriguing.
