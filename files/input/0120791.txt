Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman give star-powered performances- both deliver the goods here and you'll enjoy it whether you're fans of them or if you're not. They're simply charming and as much as people may want to dislike Kidman for being Ms. Cruise, she again proves she's a star in her own right.Forget the critics and the Be-faithful-to-the-book drones, this is a good movie- hip, edgy and sometimes spooky.  If this was a movie made by two unknown actresses, it would be a gem critics would recommend to audiences, but for some reason with Bullock and Kidman, it gets reviewed on a different scale and ends up short for people.  Forget all that- it's great entertainment with yes, two pretty big stars- but they can't help that so get over it and enjoy the movie for what it is- a real gem.

I was surprised that so many others didn't care for it.  I just loved the sets, the costumes, the women and their relationships, the real magic in the film, the special effects, the child actresses.  This was stuff that women could relate to better than men.  Aidan Quinn was the only boring part of the movie.  I wished they'd chosen an actor who was more into the role.  He seemed bored and made his part in the film more boring.  (Also, he mumbles.  Someone should give him elocution lessons.)This movie wasn't meant to be heavy.  It was meant to be light, fun fluff, and that it is.  The characters weren't meant to be deep, but I felt the relationship between the two sisters was deeper and well performed by two skilled actresses.  In spite of the fluffiness of it, I enjoyed the two scenes in which we got to sit and relax to the sound of Stevie Nicks' Crystal.  So what if cars weren't crashing and guns weren't shooting.  They weren't supposed to be.  I felt the camaraderie of the moment as the two sisters and their aunts got drunk on midnight margaritas while dancing to Harry Nilsson's Lime in the Coconut.  It was just plain light fun.  Also, women can enjoy the vicarious satisfaction of watching these women destroy the evil, bullying man who tries to destroy them. The end of the film was rather Disney-kiddie-flick-like.  Another ending might have worked better, but it was tolerable because it reminded the audience that the film was all in fun, and not to be taken seriously.I usually prefer deeper films, but I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of fluff.  Sure it was silly and campy, but it was fun.  A film doesn't have to take itself seriously to be fun.  Bullock, Kidman, Channing, and Wiest are beautiful, charming and wonderful to watch in this flick, and I love watching the four of them over and over again.

The bonding and care between the sisters and the Aunts, standing against the rest of the town's distrust and dislike shows family strength.  When Sandra is weeping over her husband dying, I cried with her. I thought it was a fabulous moment for her in the movie.If you want a movie about a woman getting revenge on an abusive husband, rent The Color Purple (ALSO a fave of mine)  This movie was playful, at times slightly spooky... Hello? It's a Witch story... it should have SOME spooky stuff in it, and I don't feel the special effects were too over done.As far as them inviting the women of the town in to help, I loved that whole sceen as well. The flash backs to the sisters as children and not wanting to let the other go... all of it. Each time that sceen pops into power mode, it makes me want to call every one of my sisters.  I haven't read the book, so I understand there might be some disappointment from those who HAVE read it. Movies rarely pack the punch of the written word they're based on.

Nicole Kidman had never been one of my favorite actress either, but I loved her in this movie (as I did Sandra Bullock). The real standouts though were Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest - watching them perform was almost worth the price of admission itself! They are wonderful.I don't see this movie as being about magic or witchcraft, the romance between Sally and Gary Hallet or even Jimmy Angelov chasing Gillian (which is a huge catalyst - but not really any more than that). For me, this movie is really about the relationships between sisters and women (the Aunts Franny and Jet, Kylie and Antonia, the Owens' women and the townswomen and of course, between Sally and Gillian - both young and adult).All of the actresses had a great chemistry, but I couldn't believe how well matched Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman were. I felt that their bond was very believable and I loved watching their relationship to each other (and themselves) grow and mature as they went from being children to adults.I certainly don't think that this film will appeal to everybody, and I can see why so many people don't get it, but if you watch it more for the relationships between the women and not so much for the romance angle or the magic I think that you will really enjoy this movie. I thought that the romance and magic were handled very well, I just saw them as being secondary to the real story. Also - it has a wonderful soundtrack.I read the book after seeing the movie, and while there are many changes between the two, I really enjoyed both. I thought that the changes made to the movie made for a better movie overall.All in all, a very enjoyable movie. I highly recommend it.

The movie fails to fully develop the town's overt fear of witches (missing only slightly), the full foreboding of something wicked this way comes with Jimmy (although the script lets them get away with it), and the magical love bond between Sally and Gary.  A few small changes, such as more supportive background music, would have made these points support and counterpoint the lighter parts of the flick.Bullock and Kidman are very good as the central characters, very believable as different-but-bonded sisters.  Kidman is a little too flaky at times to be a fully credible witch, but this characterization runs well enough in context.  Channing (whom I rarely enjoy) and Wiest are excellent in major supporting roles, outdone only by Webb and Wood (Sally's daughters) who show their abilities by *not* overacting their potentially cutesy roles. Instead, they do a great job in stating variations on their mother and Aunt Gilly.Overall, I think most aspects of direction and production could have used one more iteration of quality improvement.  Still, the movie is quite enjoyable, and worth watching again some time.

If not, have a nice day.There is no devil in the Craft. How wonderful to hear those words come out of Sandra Bullock's mouth! I was simply delighted.I'm not going to sit here and waste your time with the plot. The movie's been out since 1998 and most of you already know it. If you haven't seen the movie, the rest of the reviews gives you the plot, ad nauseum.Nicole Kidman's character, Gillian Owens, is played wonderfully as a seductress. It was a bit stereotypical (remember the flighty Wiccan in Blair Witch 2?), but well played by Kidman.I did not like the use of Belladonna, as it is used in the movie. It portrays a dark intent, which is something anyone in the Craft will tell you is strictly against the rules. However, it is a tendency in Gillian's (Kidman's) character to be drawn towards the dark path, and was therefore fitting.And who can't identify with Sandra Bullock's Sally Owens wanting nothing more than to be normal? Who IS normal? WHAT is normal? Love is normal. And that's all she wants is to love unequivocally and receive that love in return. And then there's The Owens Family Curse. We all have ours. Some bald early, some have the unbelievably spacious nose inherited from Uncle Elmer. My family curse is the lack of child-bearing women in My family, hence I am the last of My mother's family. She had only Me and I have bore no live children. At least she didn't put the usual curse on Me. (The I hope you have a kid JUST LIKE YOU! curse.).The idea of Sally (Bullock) owning/operating a botanical shop, I manufacture bath oils, is spot on. Many Magick Users long to do something along those lines.Sally and Gillian's bringing back Gillian's lover (Goran Visnjic) from the dead (?!) We don't do that. (Dianne Wiest as Auntie Bridget Owens) That spell book would have had to have been passed down from at least 5 generations, if not more to even HAVE a spell like that within its bindings. That having been said, those in the Craft don't do that. Most CAN'T do that, and those who can...well...shouldn't. Necromancy is of the Dark Arts, and is no part of the Craft. And finally, the ending.The ending was quite fantastic and over the top. Insanity, if you ask Me, but ... no one did.Jumping off the roof of their house, in full witch regalia complete with pointy hats, bucked shoes and red and white-striped stockings, and floating down to the ground safely and slowly, FLOATING! down like that...put a fantasy-styled ending to what otherwise would have been a big boost for Pagans in the mundane world.It's a very entertaining story, and contains great portrayals by.... Sandra Bullock .... Sally Owens Nicole Kidman .... Gillian Owens Stockard Channing .... Frances Owens Dianne Wiest .... Bridget Owens Evan Rachel Wood .... Kylie Owens Alexandra Artrip .... Antonia Owens ...right up until the ending. But the ending doesn't negate the entire movie. It just degraded its value far more than Pagans would have liked. It still gets a 7.2/10 from...the Fiend .

So when I went to see 'Practical Magic' the movie, I didn't know what to expect, since most movie adaptions from books are very different and disappointing. But, while this was very different from the novel, I was pleasantly surprised. 'Practical Magic' is not your average romantic comedy or your average witch movie. Instead, it mixes the 2 genres together and creates a sparkling film that never gets boring. Even though some scenes are a little far-fetched, the acting, relationships and storyline keep it from getting too weird.As for the cast, I don't think it gets much better. Sandra Bullock pretty much plays her usual character, but she plays it with a well-acted sensitivity and you definitely sypathize for her. Nicole Kidman, is brilliant--very wild-child, but not so trampy that you hate her--and probably the most interesting character ( and the best performance) in the whole movie. Dianne Weist and Stockard Channing are extremely well cast as the eccentric aunts, and their on-screen presence is breathtaking. Aidan Quinn is also very good, playing Sandra Bullock's 'perfect man'. So what's my final outlook on 'Practical Magic'? Excellent. Sure, it's not a flawless, Oscar-worthy, masterpiece, but it's fun and one of the most interesting films I have seen in a long time. So, if you're looking for a well-acted, well-written, unique film, I definitely recommend 'Practical Magic'. And don't forget to read the book!

Nothing was too wrong or inaccurate, after all, there are as many incarnations of witchcraft practices as there are shades of green. That is to say that any portrayal is not necessarily wrong, as there are no set teachings in what is right and what is wrong when practising the craft. So to the person who said it was totally incorrect when the bird is stabbed with the needle as Wicca doesn't do it, no. Your practice of wicca doesn't but other's might.My main complaints about the film are script and production inaccuracies. The first is when Kidman is saying that her boyfriend is from Bulgaria close to Transilvania... he's got the whole Dracula-cowboy thing going on. Please. Transilvania is a region in Romania - a totally different country. Even from the border of Bulgaria and Romania to Transilvania is at least a couple of hundred miles. The 2 countries are different in language and culture. I really hate when films from the USA get such basically simple but fundamental things such as geography wrong. It's not hard to get these things right! The second thing in the film, which is more of a goof... when Sandra Bullock had to go and rescue Nicole Kidman, the aunts were going to take the kids to the Solstic Celebrations. There are solstices a year. One on 21 June. The other on 21 December. The film was supposed to be set around the December solstice. There was no mention or indication of Christmas (or anything to do with the Christmas season) in the film. OK, witches may not necessarily put up a tree, etc. But in the scenes with Kidman in Arizona, or wherever, surely the motel would have had something Christmassy - from experience in the USA, 4 days before Christmas, everything has lights and decorations.I'm tired typing.

Mmm.Personally, I've never felt such intensely contradicting emotions during the course of one movie. Most of the times I'm grimacing for better plot development. That is, can the story dump the cliches with more confidence and truly explore real-life issues of women such as abuse --- instead of using it as a stepping-stone for sexy actresses to get wicked and 'bewitched'?!) The stock characters of the female townies, always adversary to the sister-witches, are truly embarrassing.The film remains superficial precisely because it touches on, rather than develops, very complex phenomena like fear of witches (read powerful women), competition among women, abusive relationships, women's cinderella dreams, fitting in, female ambitions (examplary housewife or wild slut - your pick), etc etc etc!!!! Instead these issues are *exploited* for a *greatly* uneven film a hodge-podge of romance, black/family comedy-drama, suspense, crime story, science fiction...We CAN still have a fun and exciting movie with a story that focuses on, respects, and gives its all to one or two of these topics without using them for their surface/shock values (really!)It's highly possible that the film started out with a solid good script based on the book and gets tampered with by the studio for maximum appeal later on. The most horrifying aspects for me? The flying witches at the end (oh GAWD!) The strange cut from the sexual passions of the main romance to a weird-and-weak confrontation with the supernatural undead boyfriend (as if the effects people are itching to drop a load of Hollywood eye candy - even at expense of awkward development!) And the overall stereotypical typecasting of women.The only enjoyable elements left of the film are the two female leads. I have to admire their courage and creativity in some of the absolutely ludicrous moments (midnight magarita, flying as witches, one nibbling on the other's ear...) And that atmospheric opener with grandma-witch who got knocked up by an unfaithful member of the male species and is crying up a storm toward an open sea?....just fastforward to Nic and Sandra.

I'm usually not that interested in romantic comedies, but this is one of the better ones.  I think the more important aspect of this movie, though, is how it presents modern Paganism (Wicca, in particular).Coming from a Pagan point of view myself, I've been waiting for this movie to come out with many mixed feelings and misgivings.  I was hoping that it wouldn't be another typical witch movie and I must say that I was really pleasantly surprised.  It did glamorize the workings of the Wiccan Craft quite a bit, but that's to be expected. How many movies are there that don't do that to their subjects? Take X-files...I'm positive that there's a lot more paperwork than action in the FBI, but you can't make a movie out of filling out forms.  If you look past the flashy stuff that was put in to draw audiences and make the movie appeal to the general public, you find a well-researched representation of what Pagans do day-to-day.  So even though it wasn't totally true to today's form of Paganism, I must say that it was a step in the right direction of overcoming all the negative PR that Pagans have had to endure all these years.

It wants so desperately to be a rom-com. But there are some really dark fantasy elements that would probably be better off as a thriller. And then there are real slices of horror. It's a wildly inconsistent mess. For so much of it, director Griffin Dunne is using such a delicate light touch to the tone that all the murder and mayhem seems weirdly fake. Bullock and Kidman are great actors who has good chemistry together as sisters. However, the chemistry between Bullock and Quinn is questionable. The main reason being that the love may be spell induced. I just don't know what to do with this mess.

As of the time I'm writing this, females rate it nearly 2 points higher than males, and in the under 18 group it's even more exaggerated.Well I'm a guy, and I dug it. If you're flexible enough to appreciate the macho man cheesiness of Commando (like Arnold Schwarzenegger riding on the landing gear of a Boeing 747) as well as the chick flick cheesiness of Pretty Woman (like Richard Gere riding on the sunroof of a white limo) ...both of which are equal in amounts of cheese but from different perspectives... then I think you can have a fun time watching Practical Magic. Why? Because it seems to hit us with both extremes.On the surface, the story seems to be brewing a sinister dark comedy the Owens women just can't seem to keep men long before they kick the bucket. Tons of potential for a slightly demented Beetlejuice kinda story, or even Heathers. But instead of going in that direction (i.e. treating death as crazy joke), Practical Magic takes it quite seriously and is not afraid to get pretty sentimental on the subject. In other words, it takes a very morbid guy flick story but treats it with chick flick sensitivity.And that's just the beginning. We haven't gotten to the other dark themes of wife beating, alcohol abuse, sexual promiscuity, murder and re-murder. So, you ask, if it has all these disturbing themes and refuses to make light of them, how the heck can this be a comedy? The answer is that the leading ladies, not just Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman but also their crazy aunts played by Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest, act their roles with playful humor and endearing wit. It reminded me a little of Sex and the City, the way the stories can be downright upsetting, but the humor comes in the way the characters behave despite it all. Practical Magic doesn't rely on a silly story for its laughs but instead lets the acting pave the way for levity.Roger Ebert gave this movie a mostly negative review, saying the movie doesn't seem sure what tone to adopt, veering uncertainly from horror to laughs to romance. But I think Ebert failed to see that the film's charm is the fact that the characters can indulge in laughs and romance *despite* the horror.Ebert also criticized 'Practical Magic' is too scary for children and too childish for adults. Who was it made for? The answer is it's made for adults who can indulge in childishness. Basically if you get the gist of my review, it's the idea that this film is an unexpected blend of opposites. I have to admit it caught me off guard for a while, but I eventually figured out the rhythm and had a fun ride.Do NOT expect a sinister, dark comedy. Do NOT expect a totally light-hearted silly romp either. The best way I can describe it would be to compare it to some of the 80s horror-comedies like Fright Night, Vamp or even Gremlins but with a dash of Thelma & Louise. Throw em all together in a giant cauldron and have some fun.

But there are many examples of the genre that have done just fine. Films like 'The Wizard of Oz,' 'Labyrinth,' and the recent 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy have delighted those who love to be taken to magical places for years now. Others like 'The Neverending Story II The Next Chapter' and 'Legend' didn't fare so well, though they still have their fans. When trying to blend fantasy with other genres you have to be careful to not let one overpower the other. You have to create a balance. 'Practical Magic,' based on a popular book, is one of these films and for the most part it works because of the talent behind and in front of the camera. But it's not quite perfect.Pros An awesome cast that seems to be having a blast. Also there's such a great camaraderie. Good sense of humor. A real sense of fun and magic. Has a lot of heart. Beautiful shooting location and the main house is a dream. Also the costume design really stands out. A nice score and soundtrack. Swift pace.Cons The film can't quite figure out what it wants to be Comedy, fantasy, romance, all three? I blame the writing. Not that the film is poorly written, it just needs focus.Final thoughts Aside from a script that's kinda all over the place, this is a really fun movie. There's no pretension about it, it's purpose is to entertain and put it a smile on your face and it does just that.My rating 4/5 "},{"Title":"Sandra and Nicole are a whimsical match","Date":"17 January 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Although it's quite simple in its approach and it doesn't really contain much depth, Practical Magic is entertaining as a lighthearted fantasy-comedy.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are Sally and Gillian Owens, two beautiful orphan sisters who were raised by their eccentric aunts, who happen to practice witchcraft.Now all grown up, the sisters finally part ways and the audience gets a glimpse at both of their interesting lives. One runs away to find adventure and one falls hopelessly in love. Everything seems perfect until a dark series of events brings the Owens sisters back together...When a malevolent force threatens to kill Gillian and begins terrorizing Sally and her children, the sisters have to dig up their magical backgrounds and dabble with dangerous spells and curses.The movie is never too serious and Sandra and Nicole shine in their roles, each giving a touching and comedic performance. They are a charming match, clearly a lot of effort was involved and they play off of each other as if they were real sisters. The most amusing characters are the wacky aunts (Stockard Channing and Dianne Weist).

She thought it was too spooky (but she covers her face with Murder, She Wrote) and just listened to the second half of the flick. I thought the movie had great potential and the power never got written into the screenplay. It's strangely ordinary and inconsequential because the emotional issues of sisterhood, bigotry (this time, against witches), and love just aren't that deeply explored.For me, it was a chance to be just entertained. And what entertainment--although Kidman is given a very secondary role, she is visually delightful. There's something very appealing to the lizard at the back of my skull with Nicole Kidman in a mini-skirt.But Practical Magic gave me a chance to rediscover Sandra Bullock, an imperfectly beautiful woman who exudes desire and decency at the same time. She's all elbows and kneecaps, with lips so pressed together that you're afraid she'll start shooting out steam from her ears and an ability to convey more than hurt and anger--disappointment and frustration are better--with her eyes.It's not prurient that I mention Bullock's breasts. Thank God she never went, as far as I can tell, for augmentation; small is just fine, thank you! When she wears a spaghetti-strapped top and no bra, she's not trying to wow you with headlights, but say that it's too damn hot to wear anything more when you're rooting around in your garden.Now, this may sound sexist piggy or psycho-pervo for me to go on about Bullock boobs, but she can get away with it. Bullock isn't a bimbo. She looks real, and that's why I've always liked her and her work.Once again, I liked Practical Magic, despite its flaws. It didn't get overwhelmed with special effects, wasn't over-the-top feminasty, and, on a side note, the girls' aunts, Stockard Channing and Diane Wiest, were delightfully similar to my wife's aunts.I say, Rent it!And stop staring at Bullock.

Veterans Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest are the eccentric spell casting aunts who take in orphaned nieces and turn them to the light side of the dark side. Growing up to be Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, they end up in bad relationships thanks to an ancient curse where any man who marries into their family will die a tragic death. Of course, Bullock ends up with two daughters (obviously no sons allowed), and the pattern threatens to be repeated.Sweetly filmed, there is still nothing that hides the fact that this really is spiritually ugly. Even in the two films that I mentioned, as well as 'The Witches of Eastwick, there was no denying the fact that the witches actually were up to no good. Here the two older aunts are presented as fun- loving Auntie Mame types, and the two younger women are presented in such heroic aspects that it is difficult to see past the fact that they are involved in dark forces. A scene where Channing and Wiest meet with a client determined to make a man fall in love with her just gives the insinuation that a woman has to turn to the dark side in order to find love in her life, and that is a very disturbing precedent, especially in a film that has such a family air about it. One of the major issues with this chick flick is that it doesn't really do any service to the advancement of women and any reason to take stories like this seriously. Certainly, Bullock's ill-fated marriage to a really nice man is emotional, but the one dimensional lover that Kidman ends up is written with absolutely no redeeming values. Aidan Quinn, as a detective on the sister's trail, is believable with a variation of qualities, but his sudden transformation under a witches spell falls short of believable. The gathering of local women in the conclusion is very anti- male, and the very final scene proves that this was just an attempt to sugarcoat what the witchy women of this family was really all about. While I can enjoy films which tackle horrific, supernatural or macabre subject matters, I strongly believe that the movies have a strong obligation to present certain ideas in a moralistic manner. There is nothing moral about showing unnatural ways of controlling another human being, and certainly any kind of magical spell to control nature is wrong. I'm guilty of adoring Channing and Wiest too much to judge them, and the fact that I liked them so much in this was very disturbing to me. They ain't no Rosemary's Baby type coven, and certainly not getting the come-uppance of the three sisters from Hocus Pocus made this questionable as to the motives of the filmmakers. And when they say that there's no devil in their craft, the only word that I can think of in response is, Bull!

There should have been something more here than what we got.What is interesting is the inclusion of music from Stevie Nicks, the White Witch. This makes me think the film had to be a strong influence on the writers of American Horror Story. The hereditary witches, the mixing of potions, bringing the dead back... and Stevie Nicks. This can't just be written off as generic witch stuff.

This film is about the 2 stars trying to escape a curse set by their ancestor on any man that loves an Owens woman. The movie does have some pretty cool looking special effects, and there is very good chemistry between all the characters in the movie. Although the film's plot seems a bit jumbled and unfocused. The movie's comedy falls flat many times even though the characters are likable. At a few points I was confused as to what the movie was actually about. Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing gave good performances as the two aunts that take in Nicole and Sandra as children after both their mother and father pass away. Like I said, the movie seems a little bit confused and some people might become bored with the movie, as I did at one point. Really the only thing I enjoyed about Practical Magic was the characters played by some of my favorite actors and actresses. 5/10 "},{"Title":"Did not coalesce into a good movie","Date":"30 May 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" It's hard to put my finger on exactly what went wrong with this movie. Many critics said things like it doesn't know what it wants to be or it is mixing genres. I don't really see anything wrong with mixing genres. It can make a film more original and less formulaic. It just seemed that most of the cast just lacked chemistry with one another. This is odd because these are very talented actors. Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock just didn't ring true in their roles as sisters. Neither did Aiden Quinn or Goran Visnjic. The real chemistry was with the older sisters, the crazy aunts, played very well by Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest. In spite of some good stuff, it did not coalesce into a good movie.

SO Bullock marries and has two kids and has a loving husband,but when Bullock(Sally) saw the black beetle she freaks out and gets a premonition that her husband has died as he got ran over by a lorry. Meanwhile her sister Gillian(Kidman)is in love with a bad boy who turns out to be a alcoholic and she poisons him with sleeping pills crushed. He dies too only to control Gillian's body. Will Sally save her sister against the evil spirit of her sister's evil boyfriend??Overall if you love witches and if you are a fan of Bullock or Kidman than check it out. Not too bad but not the best film I have ever seen.Keep an eye out for Stockard Channing who plays a witch in this movie and irish actor Aidan Quinn as Bullocks new love interest.

Family, love, acceptance, and challenges. Practical magic covers all those things. It's a movie where you learn to accept those different from you, you learn about family, you learn about love, and you learn about magic.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman shine as sisters, Sally and Jillian Owens. They were born into a family of witches. Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest star, as they're eccentric but loving aunts Aunt Frances and Aunt Bridget respectively. The girls are sent to live with their aunts after their parents passed away. The Owens women are under a curse, it happens when they fall in love. The man they are in love with will die. One night while watching their aunts cast a spell for a woman desperately in love, Jillian decides to take a chance on love, while Sally decides to cast a spell to protect herself. Jillian leaves home from their small Massachusetts town, while Sally stays behind with their aunts. Before Jillian leaves, they cast a promise to each other, using the blood of their hands. It's one of the most touching scenes in the movie where you can see just how strong their bond is. Sally ends up falling in love with Michael, a produce salesman in town. The curse strikes again leaving Sally a widow, and a single mom of two daughters. Jillian finds herself in a bad relationship, and one night uses their bond to call on Sally when she's in trouble. Sally shows up and accidentally kills Jillian's boyfriend by using too much magic. But in a twist, he's not really dead and haunts the sisters until their family, and town come together to stop him. A stranger rolls in to town to investigate and finds himself strangely drawn to Sally. Would she take a chance on love again? Will the curse ever be broken? The end of the movie will leave you speechless. This movie is one of the greatest movies because it covers everything. The cast shines, the set and town where they chose to film set the scene perfectly, and the beginning gives you a clear picture of how the Owen women came to be. I would recommend this movie to anyone.

Great supporting cast with Diane Wiest, Stockard Channing, Aidan Quinn and Goran Visnjic, it's well acted, as a drama rather than a fantasy (which can often be cheesy) but this has a lot of tenderness, suspense and love; both romance and sisterly. It's also funny - Bullock often brings humour in her delivery - and entertaining and watchable. It is a bit Hollywood and predictable but that is part of the charm as of course you want a happy ending.Essentially about a family of females who are witches, and generally hated by their community. They've never had luck with love and generations of women have ended up alone until fate deals them a hand that allows them to love and be part of the community.

Come on, guys, did you lose your sense of humor and your sense of wonder somewhere else? I have never read Alice Hoffman's novel, upon which this movie was made, but I liked this movie a lot. This is fresh, upbeat, very sweet work, and it is very humorous, quick, very romantic in a true sense, and never drags. The scenery is pretty beautiful, and hey, the house is a real wonder here, you just feel like wishing you'd be living there! The script is nothing very difficult to grasp and this is the very mixture of various genres that makes this movie so endearing and ultimately watchable. I enjoyed the excellent performances of Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman - they did a very good job here, and they never forgot to be funny and even clumsy when necessary. Great and refreshing soundtrack made the watch even more exctiting and cool. There are several unanswered questions within the plot, but maybe the novel answered them, and I was just a bit perplexed. But this is a minor misdemeanor, in general, this is a very good Sunday night watch!

Kidman is a little too flaky at times to be a fully credible witch, but this characterization runs well enough in context. Channing (whom I rarely enjoy) and Wiest are excellent in major supporting roles, outdone only by Webb and Wood (Sally's daughters) who show their abilities by *not* overacting their potentially cutesy roles. Instead, they do a great job in stating variations on their mother and Aunt Gilly.Overall, I think most aspects of direction and production could have used one more iteration of quality improvement. Still, the movie is quite enjoyable, and worth watching again some time. "},{"Title":"Great story suffers from Hollywood chick-flick syndrome","Date":"2 May 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Alice Hoffman's Practical Magic is an eccentric little novel centering on the misadventures of two sisters with a talent for benevolent witchcraft. It would truly make a great movie...this is not it.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are cast as Sally and Gillian Owens, two polar opposite sisters who hail from a bizarre family where the females are noted for their mastery of hocus pocus and their bad luck with men. Naturally, the community scorns them and their borderline batty aunts, played by Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing, which causes the sisters to strike out on their own with varying degrees of success. The cautious Bullock happily marries, but finds hubby number one stricken by the family curse of early demise. The free-spirited Kidman gets saddled with abusive whack-job Goran Visjnic. When the sisters finally come together, Bullock's efforts to rescue Kidman go awry with a supernatural bent.Where Hoffman's novel was whimsical, the tone of the film is sledgehammer with flourishes of TV sitcom. The screenplay does not seem to want to take the time to set up the sister's travails and their successes in life and wants to rush everything to its own disadvantage. Whimsy is a hard quality to capture and maintain on film, but the fact that Practical Magic does not even try and pitches everything to the lowest common denominator says it all. Instead of amusing, insightful and deliciously off-kilter characters and situations, we get a truck-load of overly familiar chick-flick nonsense - including the by now too familiar and embarrassing women lip-synching and dancing around the kitchen routine.The latter third of the film gets bogged down in a completely wrong-headed subplot which finds Kidman possessed by the evil spirit of Visjnic and requiring the assistance of the aforementioned nasty townswomen to perform an exorcism. It is a development that never appeared in the novel and it comes out of left field in the film. One can only imagine the writers gabbing amongst themselves about what a great twist this would be. Unfortunately, we never believe that Kidman is truly in any danger, the townswomen far too easily throw aside their differences with the witches and start spouting nauseatingly precious bilge about sisterhood, and the whole thing degenerates into equal parts misfired special effects show and cheesy female empowerment monologues.The only thing that prevents the film from becoming a total loss are the lead actresses. Bullock is vulnerable and winning as the level-headed sister. Kidman is sexy and funny as the wilder sister not afraid to shake things up. Unfortunately, a prime plot from the novel that gave Kidman a genuine romance that would have really showcased her range has been omitted to favor the foolish exorcism plot here. Both actresses are so far better than the material that they are handed that it seems a real tragedy that they have not yet been given an opportunity to play opposite each other in better material. Wiest and Channing take the stock roles of the batty old aunts and ground them enough to make the clichés seem more charming than they have any right to be. The men have it rougher. Visjnic is sexy, but not especially menacing as the bad-guy plaguing Kidman. Aidan Quinn shows up late in the film as a police officer and new love interest for Bullock. He looks bored and so will you be. Mark Feuerstein has some nice early moments as Bullock's first husband, but the film does not have much use for him.Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the leads, this ranks as another example of a promising novel robbed of any originality or insight on its way to the screen. If the screenplay had not stooped to so many of the tiresome chick flick clichés and had trusted its target audience to embrace something a bit different, it would only have been for the better. Instead, we have a whole lot of something that might have been, but sadly isn't.

After watching it many (MANY) times as an adult with a much better trained eye, I realize that, while its script is actually well written, there are a number of editing errors that are very noticeable (which you can either read about or see for yourself). The score, written by Alan Silvestri, has a touch of the Renaissance to it, with many well developed themes, and supports the movie well. The setting is quaint, but relatable. The supporting characters are not average by any means, but are still lovable in their own magical way. The main characters, Sally and Gillian, stand out as strong women deeply involved in their quest for normality while being drawn deeper into the things they fear most a life less ordinary; complications of their current lives with their backgrounds; and the chance that they will never find love. While unrealistic in a few places (you'll see what I mean when you see it), most can be put toward the mystical qualities inherent in the main family of characters.

One of their ancestors put a curse on any man involved with a woman in her family, and the curse lost the sisters their father and Bullock's husband. Her two aunts, however, Francis and Bridget (Channing and Wiest) still practice their spells. When Gillian takes up with the wrong man (again) (Goran Visjnic), she calls Sally. As a result of Sally's help, they find themselves in a lot of trouble and have to take drastic measures. Things don't work out as planned.I'm not sure what the problem is - it appears that some people on IMDb expect every film to be Magnolia, and if it isn't, they reject it as junk. This movie is what it is intended to be - light, with some suspense, some scares, some fun, lots of warmth, and great characters. If you read the book, disappointment is more understandable, and I feel your pain.The acting is excellent, with four top actresses as the stars, and the relationships between them are excellent as well.

Bullock and Kidman give relaxed, convincing performances, but I think the problem lies in the writing of the characters. I felt that they were strict character types, and totally lacked subtlety and nuance. The same could probably be said for the rest of the film actually. Everything was very black and white. Total evil or perfect love. Worst enemies or best friends. Complete confusion or utmost certainty. I felt that it was all very inhuman, and I was never fully sutured as a result. This film may have been full of magic, but a grounding in reality is important. Life just isn't that clear cut, and people who have been in bed for days never look that perfectly groomed.

That's the problem.  So much is going on, everything happens with minimal impact.  Though physically unconvincing as sisters, Nicole Kidman (terrific) and Sondra Bullock (fine) emote fine chemistry.  Far less effective are all of the male actors, whom seem to be there as plot devices and nothing more.WARNING  POSSIBLE SPOILERWithout doubt, the weakest element of the film is the resolution of the family curse.  The exorcism is unconvincing, requiring previously unsympathetic characters to become nice.  Worse, we are ask to believe the uniting of the women has somehow lifted the death curse without showing us any evidence to this truth. This plays to even lesser effect, since the main male romantic lead plays no part in this climactic scene.Even if somewhat lacking in the prerequisite magic, Practical Magic is muddled fun.

There is precious little magic, and having seen the trailer, it certainly isn't the comedy that was advertised.The film is significantly darker and more dramatic than that, but still manages to pull some laughs.I think it was the script that accounted for that, all of the main characters get some great one-liners, but the rest was uneven.  It couldn't decide whether it was a romance, a comedy, a tragi-comedy, or a horror.  One scene late in the film of the excorcism of a the ghost of a serial killer is VERY out of place, and for some reason is played with almost a comedy atmosphere.  Doesn't work.It is still an enjoyable film, and one of the odd category that I have discovered  You watch the film and get absorbed into it, although noticing glaring problems like the excorcism, then step out from the theatre and immediately many more holes appear.Its not as bad to watch as it is to read peoples accounts of the flaws, let me put it that way.  The experience is better than it sounds, despite problems.It had elements that could have been made MUCH creepier, but which were smoothed over, especially the line There's a man under the roses.  They grew over night...Ah well.Sandra Bullock actually acts quite well in this, because the character is not allowed to be perky and cheerful, thus forcing her to act.  She does this quite well.

The solid performances from Bullock (predictable, but charming) and Kidman (not so predictable, and quite well played) kept the main core of the plot from unravelling, while the back-up support of the aunts (played brilliantly (IMHO) by Wiest and Channing) and the kids imbued a quirky humour that is this movie's main grace.I do have some gripes - I found the main romance to be somewhat unconvincing, but then, that could be just me )  And the theory of much of the witchcraft seemed to be made up wholesale - surprise, surprise.  I sometimes wonder if Hollywood ever does its homework on these things.As I said, it's not Shakespeare.  But an overdose of the Bard can be too much of a good thing.

Thank God she's not some kind of personality, sometimes all you want to see is someone who can play normal characters properly, even if it's a witch; because, beyond being a witch, Sally - Bullock's character - could be the girl next door.Nicole Kidman is Sally's sister Gillian, she has some magic skills too, but prefers to live like a tramp, while Sally tries to live as normally as she can. Their parents died when they were young because of a curse that lays over their family and so they are raised by two nice and gentle witch aunts (Diane Wiest and Stockard Channing, fabulous as always).

So despite what bad reviews I heard regarding this movie, when it came out, I decided to go.  I dragged my two friends and we set out for the only theater in our small college town.  Had I know that it was more about witchcraft than a romantic comedy, I probably would have waited to rent it on video, but once in the theater it was too late.  And when the movie was over, I hate to say it, but I was sadly disappointed.  Luckily, at this small theater we only had to shell out $3.50 for a Sunday afternoon matinee, anything more would have been a crime. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman work wonderfully together on stage as sisters, Sally and Gillian Owens, who are raised by their two aunts, Frances (Stockard Channing) and Jet (Dianne Wiest), as young children, after the death of their parents.  The girls come from a long line of witches, and the sisters, especially the younger, Sally, have received this special gift of magic.  The girls grow up with their aunts in a carefree environment having fun and learning spells.  The only problem is that years ago, a curse was put on all Owens women, saying that all men they truly love will die before their time. The sisters, as young adults, both try to escape their magical background in different ways.  Gillian, the wilder of the two runs off and spends her time with different men, while Sally searches for a normal life.  Sally, with the help of her Aunts, marries and has two girls of her own, which have a striking resemblance to her and her sister.  But their magic free life changes when Gillian meets one man whose presence brings on a chain of events that the sisters must handle together.  This results in the addition of a new character, Officer Gary Hallet (Adian Quinn), who enters not only the story, but also the hearts of the characters and the audience alike. This movie has all the elements of a four star flick; talented cast, good themes, great music and fantastic cinematography.  Love, romance, relationships, friendship, family values, acceptance, and murder are all thrown together with a little witchcraft to create the story.  And the movie probably would have been a success if it were not for one thing the script. I have not read the book, but I feel that many of the details of the story were missing and that questions were left unanswered.  This is because too many sub-plots were going on at once and as soon as the audience got involved in one, another would arise and there was no closure to the previous plot. Some of the aspects of the book should not have been included in the movie; it was just too much. I would have to agree with the critics on this one, Practical Magic is not worth your time or money.

All the characters are awesome, and I found the second half to be just as good as the 1st, if not better, plus Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are simply amazing in this!. It's extremely well made and written in my opinion, and it has a perfect mix of thrills, Romance, Fantasy and Drama/Mystery, plus it's unpredictable throughout!. The child actresses are surprisingly excellent as well (especially Camilla Belle and Evan Rachel Wood), and Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest are brilliant as the two Aunts, plus I thought the ending was just perfect!. The finale is full of surprises and suspense, and it actually has a couple of cool possession scenes as well, plus Goran Visnjic is especially great in his creepy role. It's also very funny at times, and I loved the music in it as well, plus the setting was really cool too. This is an awesome film about Witches, that's really entertaining, with a great story, Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are absolutely wonderful together, and I say it's a must see!. The Direction is awesome!. Griffin Dunne does an awesome! job here, with wonderful camera work, great angles, adding good atmosphere, and using a great setting, plus he kept the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is terrific!. Sandra Bullock is amazing as always and is amazing here, she is incredibly gorgeous, extremely likable, had brilliant chemistry with Nicole Kidman, was vulnerable, and played the good girl of the two, she was amazing! (Bullock Rules!!!!!!!). Nicole Kidman is also amazing as always and is amazing here, she is incredibly gorgeous, mysterious, very likable, and was especially good in scenes when she was possessed, she played the bad girl of the two well, as you will care for what is happening to her character. (Kidman Rules!!!!!!!). Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest are brilliant as the Aunts, they were just too cool, and were very funny, I loved them both!. Goran Visnjic is great here, and is extremely creepy, he had a really cool character, I dug him lots. Aidan Quinn is good as the love interest and as the investigator, I liked him. Evan Rachel Wood and Alexandra Artrip are good as Sally's kids, and were both surprisingly very likable. Camilla Belle is also good as a young Sally. Rest of the cast are fine.

This is a movie that had me confused at the end of it. I still didn't know what my feelings were when it ended, only that something was missing from it to make it a truly wonderful movie viewing experience for me. This is certainly not awful but there are a few reasons why it didn't do all it could have for me.I've seen movies that movie way to slowly. That wasn't Practical magic's problem. Rather, the opposite. It went from this- to that- to the other so so quickly there was almost no specific order to anything, just when you think the movie's about one thing off in another direction it goes. I had no problem following it but didn't know what I was supposed to be following. Is it a romance? a film Noir, witch style? a drama about two sisters and family? a black comedy? a straight out horror? I wasn't sure(until the end frankly) what this movie was supposed to be about, it jumped around so much and there was little buildup to anything. I just felt, if there is such a thing as a movie moving to QUICKLY this was a prime example.Another problem was the music. Although I love the use of music in movies, to capture certain scenes and elements of a movie, I felt the music choices were a bit wrong here and didn't really add anything to the movie as a whole.That's not to say I didn't enjoy the captivating cinematography or amazing acting-Bullock and Kidman were good choices, they lit up the screen.Aiden Quinn is perfect in everything he does and this was no exception. The special effects were beautiful and amazing and The last scene in particular was wonderful.But I really didn't enjoy this all that much at all. I probably would not watch it again. It was cute, it had it's moments. It rates to me about a 5.5. But the lack of a specific organization to the storyline and the fact that I felt many scenes just fell flat prevented me from really getting into this, though it's not a BAD movie at all. My vote is 5.5 of 10.

My perspective is the following Having not read the book, but having read a number of 'user comments' who have, there's no doubt that the script veers considerably from the thrust of the book.  Perhaps this explains why there were considerable leaps from reality, hoping the viewer would not mind the 'jumps & jerks' from what was supposed to be a realistic 'peek' at the unique world of 'witches' even though they be of good heart and purpose.  Just look at the conclusion (one user/viewer said it was somewhat like Disney's approach) as an example. There no doubt is a 'dark' side to witchcraft, as well as a lighter side, both of which produce their own consequences, which it seemed this story line was trying to present.  The romantic side for some reason, was unconvincing, which I'm not sure was Aidan Quinn's problem; this was likely caused by the script. Stories such as this fail to bring in other religious perspectives such as, IF THERE ARE WITCHES, ISN'T IT LIKELY THAT THERE IS GOD AS WELL, supposed to be the ultimate supreme power and being?   Wether you are Jewish, Christian, Muslim or any other who believes in an ultimately supreme being, dealing with any form of supernatural power without including 'the supreme being' in the formula of the story, really is quite without credibility.

Loving the book, I went to the movie. I never finished the book for whatever reason, but I'm gonna go back to it now. Because I love both the book and the film. While they're both different, they're both strong for what they contribute to this charming story. I had only seen the film once while in theatres, and didn't see it again until a few weeks ago. The night I watched this I happened to be in a fragile, emotional mood and the beautiful, emotional score composed by Alan Silvestri made me literally cry. The film eased my worries and depression somewhat and made me feel better. Now I own the film and am glad I do. The story between the two sisters as well as the aunts, the townspeople, and Gary Hallet is a warm and charming story, and looks kindly upon the craft of Wicca (Witchcraft). I will never completely stop being frustrated by the endless amount of ignorance that surrounds the subject of witchcraft. People assume it's evil and buy into the ignorance of those who claim it's evil while really knowing nothing themselves about the actual craft. If they actually opened a book on the subject they'd know it's an age-old religion (religion's actually a wrong word) that has been around since the time of the ice ages, and is ten times older than Christianity and is a beautiful SPIRITUALITY that worships the earth, the sun, the moon, the grass, the bark on a tree. It worships the power of the human being and the power of the animal. Funny how such a beautiful craft could get tangled up in bad media and be labeled as evil. The main reason I love this film is for the scene between Sally and Gary in the greenhouse, when she says There's no devil in the craft. Bingo. One of the books i have on Wicca lists the rules involved in representing Wicca. The number one rule is Harm none. And the book goes on to explain that there is, literally, NO DEVIL in witchcraft. Witches do not even BELIEVE in a devil. Then she goes on to take out his badge and explain It's just a star. Your talisman. It can't stop criminals in their tracks. It has power because you believe it does. The cross in christianity holds power because of the power placed upon it by its believers. A pentacle in wicca, which is a symbol of the earth and life, has power because wiccans place energy and power upon it. Just like eveything else in life that holds any power for anybody of any belief. And Practical Magic exlains that wonderfully. It's a delicious, charming, and yes, magical movie.

They are both best in this film when they are flirtatious, sarcastic, drunk and hungover, but I think one emotion which neither one of them is terrific at expressing is fear (Bullock's a little better in this department).  Unfortunately, because the film is trying to balance light comedy with dark forces there is call for a lot of gasping and swooning that is highly unbecoming to two such talented eyelash-batters.  And most of the gasping and swooning is done with a complete lack of humor.Also - a contrived ending in which all the women in the town who have previously taunted the Owens sisters for 20 years with cat-calls of witchery and projectile garden vegetables are suddenly interested in coming over to their house to help them perform an exorcism.  Why the sudden change?  It's insulting to sum it up with there's a little witch in every woman. Hundreds of years of fear cannot be overcome by a single telephone call. It's absolute silliness to watch these women prance around, embracing witchcraft when they have expended so much energy denouncing it.Overall this is a fluffy, erratic and unorganized movie whose success is wholly dependent on the attractiveness of its two adorable stars (both, in this case, well-heeled in the latest neo-bohemian fashions).

Actually, for the first hour or so; Practical Magic isn't all that bad. It's not all that good, but it sets itself up well, and constantly seems to be hinting that better is to come. The plot revolves around two witches bringing one of their boyfriends back to life, and I thought that once this got put into action, the film was going to pick up more; but to my surprise, once the plot gets going; the film just falls apart. Throughout the film, we know that the family of witches is hated by the local community because they're different - yet once we get past the halfway point, the neighbourhood is coming round to help the girls cast a spell! This is just one of the inconsistencies of this film, and throughout I got the impression that Practical Magic doesn't think much of it's audience's intelligence.The plot revolves around two girls that are witches. They grow up into Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman; the former being happily married to a man she loves, while the latter has found herself in all sorts of trouble with a nasty boyfriend played by Goran Visnijic. However, a curse on the family means that any man they love will meet an untimely death, and that's what happens to Sandra Bullock's husband. Kidman's boyfriend dies too, only it's by her hands and despite trying to bring him back to life; he becomes an evil entity that haunts the sisters. It doesn't sound all that engrossing, and it isn't. The plot has the potential to give way to an interesting flick, but it's themes are all over the place and, as mentioned, the film becomes ridiculous after we get past the halfway point. The two leads are good, however, and give the film it's only solid positive element. Casting Diane Wiest as an aging aunt was something of a stroke of genius, as I cant think of anyone that fits the bill better - but generally speaking, any form of genius is something that this film is very much lacking.

First, by watching it I found a very nice story about two sisters who grew up to be played by Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman. Bullock played herself, but Kidman had a much more difficult role which she pulled of very well. All they really wanted to be was normal, and be accepted as such. By studying the scenes where so-called goofs were, I found that most of them are not really goofs at all, but various viewers drawing flawed  conclusions after a less than thorough viewing. For example, at one point Bullock is working in the garden, mud on her jeans, a goof was that when she got inside the pants were no longer dirty. In fact they are still dirty, it is clear, anyone watching it carefully will arrive at the same conclusion. Point being, the goofs sections often cannot be trusted, as people put perhaps 50% to 90% mistaken goofs in the goofs section.SPOILERS FOLLOW -- note for my recollection. Kidman returns bruised, bad boyfriend, he comes to get her, Bullock kills him with heavy pot, they use a spell to bring him back, is worse than before, they kill him again and bury him in front yard, investigator tracks his car to the house, gets suspicious, becomes sweet on Bullock, finds out old boyfriend was a really bad guy, comes to possess Kidman, dramatic exorcism takes place, with no evidence, investigator is told the truth, overlooks it, will everyone be happy now, finally??

It seemed, however, that the development of her character turned her into an addle-brained, weak woman type.  She didn't use her powers to protect her sister from Angelov, she couldn't put two words together in response to Halleck's questions, physically she fought Angelov like a woman landing little love-tap like blows to his back while he was choking Gillian in the back of his car. Unwitchly and very un-modern woman.The witchcraft ritual performed to remove Angelov's spirit from Gillian was laughable.  First the name Hecate was mis-pronounced.  Second, why would the PTA women be interested in helping the witches perform a very powerful ritual when throughout the movie these people seemed to genuinely fear the Owens.  Not plausible.  The ritual itself seemed to be incorrect, the term is not to banish the spirit (as they said) but to exorcise it and that would not be done by holding Gillian and the spirit within the walls of a protective circle--the circle is usually used to protect the sorcerer or to hold the spirit captive.  So, ritually this scene didn't pan out either.Halleck came from Arizona to investigate the whereabouts of Halleck. Legally, he was out of his jurisdiction, didn't have a right to carry a gun, had no business questioning Sandra Bullock and she had no business answering him.  I laughed when he spoke into his recorder saying this is the testimony of Sally Owens. Its not testimony, testimony is given in open court under oath, this would not even have been a statement under oath.  So, from a legal standpoint, the whole premise is suspect and unbelievable. Some details included added nothing to the story, such as the mysteriously growing rosebush and/or why Sandra Bullock was cutting it down--the fact that Angelov's spirit was still around was already established by Sally's red-haired daughter who saw it.  Besides, Bullock was cutting the rose bush down with the wrong equipment, she was using a hedge trimmer!Frankly, if you're going to make a fantasy movie, the only way to get me to suspend by disbelief is to pay attention to details and that was not done in this movie.  It did have its moments for me however.  Diane Wiest and Stockard Channing did a superb job as the Aunts--they were far more witch-like and yet who wouldn't want them serving you chocolate for breakfast?Better skip this one I'm sorry to say.

The special effects are subtle but effective to say the least. This is what Sandra Bullock does best in my opinion. She plays an innocent so well that when things work out for her, you find yourself emotionally involved in her story. The film is a little overlong, otherwise very entertaining.

It's only fair to have a few similarly implausible numbers where women (albeit fahbulously foxy ones) score (i.e. marriage) with dreamy, strong-but-sensitive, protective guys with whom they can Live Happily Ever After. And even the dangerous bad man is Goran Visnjic, whose only flaw is that he wants desperately to marry Kidman's character - with menaces if necessary. Fair enough. The male equivalents focus on equally infeasible breasts, after all.There are aspects that do make one think, though. I really don't believe this witch thing, for example, is healthy. A number of shows are currently pushing this particular fantasy. Perhaps it's no more dangerous than the male one in which Our Man routinely dodges surface-to-air missiles, but it seems that some gullible people really believe this stuff, and think they actually have magical abilities. Witch Power is the new Women's Intuition.(I note with alarm another review here which speaks darkly about Belladonna's supposed 'dark' powers lady, Belladonna is just atropine, a stimulant. It's just a chemical, like adrenalin, and nothing magical. Like most 'medicinal' plants, Deadly Nightshade is just trying to discourage animals from eating it, by dosing them with a substance that, inter alia, wrecks appetite.) I digress. In sum, this is not a very good film, but it's just wish fulfilment for those of a female persuasion and a certain age. Male viewers will probably have to derive what enjoyment they can from observing some very pretty and/or very talented actors, though in a far from ideal vehicle.

She showed off amazing talent as the desperate-to-be-normal Sally. Nicole's possesion scenes were also very intoxicating. The music gave the finishing touch. The soundtrack (Executively Produced by Sandra Bullock) was not only touching, but truly inspirational, with a strong helping hand from Stevie Nicks and Sheryl Crow.Possibly Sandra's best movie since While You Were Sleeping, and a definate must-see!

I wasn't expecting to like the Alice Hoffman novel this movie is based on, but it's a wonderful work which lives up to its title; it's about magic, but less about the bubble, bubble, toil and trouble kind(though there is some of that) than the magic that is in everyday life, and everything is grounded in some kind of reality.  And all four main characters(Sally, her sister Gillian, and her two daughters Kylie and Antonia) are well drawn and ones you care about.The movie, on the other hand, is awful.  All the delicacy, subtlety, nuance, and especially the human quality are thrown right out the window.  Instead, director Griffin Dunne and writers Adam Brooks, Akiva Goldsman, and Robin Swicord(though Goldsman has by far the worst track record, so I'd like to believe he's the most responsible) substitute your standard witches story, and while they keep some of the plot of the novel, it makes no sense when thrown in with this rubbish.  The look of the film is all wrong; we even look like we're in a cheap horror movie.  You don't get much sense of the characters, or of them being capable of anything(in the novel, after her husband dies, and after she spends a year being miserable, Sally leaves; here, she just stays, why?  Cause it's the Idiot Plot).  And while Bullock and Kidman deserve credit for trying to mine something out of this(Bullock is the most successful here), Dianne Wiest is lost, Stockard Channing is uncharacteristically awful(she must have had some reason to channel Bette Davis, but damned if I know it), and Aidan Quinn looks like he'd rather be somewhere else(who could blame him?).

But Dianne Wiest and probably Nicole Kidman should really have known better.

It's brilliant. I haven't read the book. Perhaps that's a reason - is the movie markedly different? Well, I'll be reading the book soon.There's amazing chemistry between the four female stars and particularly between Bullock and Kidman. The premise for the story, well I don't know if that's very original or has been done many times before as I don't usually read books on this sort of theme, ie magic, and at the start of the movie I wondered if I'd like it. Was it going to be a tragedy? When Sally's husband is killed off and Sally is deeply depressed for so long after , I was upset, thinking oh dear this is going to be miserable, am I sure I want to watch any more of this and end up feeling utterly dismal at the end of it. I really don't like unhappy endings. Fortunately I carried on watching because I admire Bullock's work and wanted to see what she made of this story, and Kidman and the aunties were so intriguing. The story becomes wild as Gilly finds herself unable to control her sexy but nasty lover and what happens to him turns this for a while into a sobering sequence of violence towards a woman, but then a truly hilarious and inspired zombie movie, especially when nice, normal cop Gary finds himself confronted with and having to believe in what he can't believe in - that zombie! The witches' finale is perfect. The Happy Ending is all there. My one sadness is that Sally's first husband and father of her two children was killed off yet the implication seems to be her witchy aunties caused her to fall in love with the guy just to make her happy because she didn't want to be a witch - so was it ever really love and happiness or just a dream? Seems to me, since they knew it'd end in misery because of the curse, they'd have done better not to interfere - but then, would she have ever met Gary and would the curse have been lifted? I suppose it all had to happen as it did.Gary the kind-hearted cop who ends up with Sally, and the youngsters who play Gilly's children are excellent as well. To bring critical ladies of the town into the Magic House to help Sally and Gilly is the obvious answer to get them to understand how being different isn't a sin nor to be despised - on the level of being different resulting in being bullied, this is a splendid movie to show how anyone who's different but not wicked suffers needless cruelty sometimes just through not conforming with the crowd. Fortunately this isn't dwelt on too much, and the witches are mostly strong characters, but still the point is made.I liked the little touches from the town ladies such as I always wanted to see inside your house which shows how most of those who aren't different would be kind if they weren't afraid of appearing different by association.Don't be put off, it isn't sermonising, it's just what you'll notice as it goes along about misconceptions leading to misery for the victims.On the DVD I enjoyed the extras except I had a big problem with the commentary. The movie was showing in the background, but for so long as I could bear to listen, the commentary was nearly all the time the director and he talked on and on about how he'd planned and made the movie etc but what he was saying bore no direct relationship to the movie scenes in the background. This was infuriating as I'd expected him and the other commentators and especially Sandra Bullock to talk about the specific scenes as they came along. Not far into the commentary, the director starts talking about how he conceived the zombie sequence, but that comes near the end of the movie. It was totally cart before the horse stuff! I concluded this commentary was made divorced from the scenes on screen and since I was already tired of the director's near-monologue and had hardly heard anything from Sandra Bullock, I switched off the commentary.

Now the true fun begins for the family....The story line can seem a bit slow at times, and the comedy is scarce, but the movie goes along at a good pace... One of my favorite scenes is the 'Midnight Margaritas' - something you have to see to believe....Channing and Weist are great as the 2 old auntie witches and Bullock & Kidman make a great pair on screen, as well..I give it an 8 out of 10....

In addition to the double billing of Bullock and Kidman, there are also veterans Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing.The movie was certainly not that terribly engaging, and didn't seem to be going anywhere for the longest time.

For me though, I think that reading a book and watching a film will always be two very different medias.  When you read, you are lost in the world your mind creates.  When you view, it is a much more linear affair with much less room for self interpretation.So... having come to this film having never read the book I fail to see the holes that others may think it has.  To me, the film is simply a good film and one that I have returned to more than once.  You all know the ones, we all have them in our collections.  There are certain films that you always associate with a certain feeling.  Then you'll be sat at home and something will trigger a memory and you'll think I know, I'll watch (insert film here).  Well, Practical Magic is one of those films.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, but as a result you never feel you have to question it's motives.  It doesn't try to be something it's not.  It's more a film about the relationship of two sisters than a tale of two witches.  The magic aspect is secondary which helps to tie in with the whole point of the movie, that magic can be practical and doesn't necessarily have to be fantastic.I think the movie does a good job of conveying this and shouldn't be knocked too badly just because it doesn't create the same images as the book may have done for you.  Every person who reads a book will have a different idea of how the characters look and the world they inhabit.  It's impossible for a film to match everyones ideals.Just watch the film for what it is and you wont be disappointed. "},{"Title":"Great screenplay.

Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman as sisters? What parallel universe does the casting person live in? Both actresses are lovely and talented, but each are the other's antithesis. Glamorous Nicole is all pale skin and red hair, so cool and immaculate and you think her skin would probably be icy to the touch- not that you would probably ever find out, so untouchable is she. By comparison, dark, earthy Sandy defies the practice of calling movie stars 'glamorous'- she possesses beauty and sex appeal, but she also exudes tremendous warmth and accessability. The implausability of these two sharing blood would be easier to ignore in the movie if these cool/warm, pale/dark qualities weren't so dominant in them. As it is, I found the contrasts to be the most interesting aspect. Anyway, Sandy and Nicole are Sally and Gillian, the latest pair of sister witches in an all-female family doomed to have the men they love die. Trying to safeguard against this, Sally is determined to never fall in love. As a precaution, she casts a spell specifying that she will only love a man with a certain combination of odd traits. Nonetheless, she does fall in love- with a man her meddling aunts bring into her life. She bears him two daughters, but- alas- the curse is a real one, and he dies. Gillian, meanwhile, is the wild one and is off living the high life with her 'Transylvanian cowboy' boyfriend. When he turns abusive, she calls on Sally. Sally is already suffering a haunting- she is so distraught over her husband's death that she has forbidden her aunts to teach her daughters magic and refuses to do so herself, though she is far more gifted a witch than Gillian. The killing, resurrection, and re-killing of the girlfriend-beater obliges them to endure a more literal haunting and the arrival of a cop (Aidan Quinn) who possesses a certain combination of odd traits. Added onto this is the suspicions of the town and the determined interference of the aunts and daughters. All of this actually sounds better than it is. The story is played out in such an insipid manner, it inspires scoffing and eye-rolling in equal (and large) amounts. The worst part of the whole affair is the climax, which is never a good thing, but should not be construed to indicate that much of anything preceding it was much good anyway.

Orphaned at a young age, the two witch sisters move into the home of their two witch aunts (played by Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest), where they are instructed in the art of witchcraft and taught about the curse they have inherited from a witch relative of the 19th century. As the two sisters blossom into two attractive young witches (with notoriously long hair, ideal bodies and enviable powers of seduction), so, too, do their desires to fight the curse now beginning to take effect.Struggling against the curse, which predestined that every man they love would die a sudden, tragic death, Sally (Bullock) and Gillian (Kidman) stretch the limits of their powers and their wits as they try to get rid of the wrong guy in their life (Goran Visnjic) and keep alive and near the right one (Aidan Quinn).In spite of the mysticism often associated with the powers of magic, which some scenes try so desperately to capture, Practical Magic is a light comedy that seems to hold no grounds outside the predictability --or rather, the boredom-- of an ordinary life of any spoiled child in search of petty love.

Nope, none of those subjective applications are in play.  It's honestly a bad film.Part of the reason is that the director (and presumably producers) are trying their hands at a mixed genre'd film.  The kind of movie that cuts across several venues, and is supposed to be more at the end than the sum of all its parts.  Adventure films are good purveyors of this kind of cross pollinated genre attempt.  In adventure films we can sense that there're going to be moments of comedy, moments of drama, moments of heroics, and the like.  And in that vein one could label this as a kind of chick-adventure film, with the sales pitch-errr.... tagline being that it's an adventure of the soul, so to speak.  But even so the adventure falls flat because it never really goes anywhere.The humor (what little there is) comes in one of two flavors for this film; 1) the subtle cutesy gag that raises giggles from giddy school girls and their mothers, and 2) the ever so hilarious ex-dead-boyfriend joke (sarcastic tone on that last phrase).  The first type is welcome, if somewhat wanting because there are so few of these, and no large laughs backing up the smaller ones.  The second type is distrubing, as it follows a kind of vindictive mindset from which the humor is emersed; an either angry or apathetic psychology.  The kind of thinking generated by a servant whose adoring master has finally died; the servant is sad his/her meal ticket is gone, but is elated at not having to put up with the verbal beatings while in their master's employ.  Death is rarely funny.  Weekend at Bernies treats death with humor, and does so succesfully.  In It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World Jimmy Durante dies, but it's done in an a-typical funny way. In Practical Magic a rotting corpse is supposed to be the point of off color jokes, comments and actions from the main characters.  Which leads one to ask who would laugh at such story material.On a more Practical side this film doesn't even address the real aspects of practices like Wicca and so forth.  All the props are there, and perhaps even the characters, but the philosophy is only touched on, and the origins (be warned, they're X-rated and not very profound if you decide to do any research) aren't so much as hinted at.  For practitioners of witchcraft, and like beliefs, this film may have some appeal, but that's largely because such people will view this through rose colored glasses (as with all other niche audiences of all other genres).  But in a hard film-vein, this movie is sorely lacking.Yet, it's not all bad.  There are moments where I found myself smiling, and even chuckled every now and then.  I also like Sandra Bullock's work as well as Nicole Kidman.  Both of them do a bangup job in this film.  But like all films striving for greatness their performances cannot possibly sustain an ill-directed and ill-adapted screenplay.Technically well founded, yet abysmally executed.  Not funny, disturbing, and dull.p.s. I dontated my DVD to the local library, so no one will ever have to waste money on renting it ever again.  I've already done that for you.

Sandra Bullock has never been more vibrant than in these scenes, and Nicole Kidman is radiant as always.The movie has other flaws as well. These include the selection of an annoying soundtrack that makes the depressing scenes even more so, and the director's penchant for close-ups in several instances when a slightly longer shot would have made the film much less jarring.

"},{"Title":"If this film were a person it would have a severe case of multiple personality disorder.","Date":"23 April 2008","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" We are all familiar with films that feature magic and witchcraft in fairy-tale or fantasy settings. Practical Magic, however, is one of those films (other examples include The Witches of Eastwick, The Craft and Bewitched) which make use of magic and witchcraft in an otherwise realistic, modern-day American setting. Sisters Sally and Gillian Owens are two modern-day American witches. Besides the hereditary ability to perform magic, their family also live under a hereditary curse, placed on them by a distant ancestress. Any man with whom they fall in love is doomed to die young, but this does not prevent Sally from falling in love with, and marrying, a young man named Michael.And then one day she sees a beetle in their kitchen. Now you and I might think a beetle portends nothing more serious than time to call the pest control people, but to witches it is apparently a harbinger of death, so Sally rips up the kitchen floorboards in an attempt to squash the pesky critter before it can work its evil magic. Unfortunately, too late. It might have been a nicely ironic touch to have Michael come into the kitchen at this point and either fall to his death through the hole in the floor or to drop dead from a heart attack brought on by the sight of the devastation his wife has wrought, but the scriptwriters evidently lacked any gift for irony, and Michael dies in a road accident.Gillian is also experiencing problems with the man in her life, although of a rather different nature. Her Bulgarian boyfriend, Jimmy, is a violent and abusive thug. (Jimmy was originally intended to be a Texan, but the script was altered when the Croatian Goran Visnjic was cast in the role. No-one, however, could be bothered to think of an authentically Bulgarian Christian name, so Jimmy he remained). The sisters accidentally kill Jimmy while attempting to prevent him from beating Gillian, but manage to use their magic powers to bring him back to life. The resuscitated Jimmy, however, proves to be even more of a thug than he was before, so they are forced to kill him a second time. Being twice-dead, however, does not prevent Jimmy's spirit from coming back to haunt the sisters, and they are forced to call on all their powers to try and get rid of him for good. An added complication is that Sally finds herself falling for Gary, the young police officer investigating Jimmy's death, and wonders whether the curse will also claim him.Nicole Kidman is one of those actresses I am never quite sure about. She was a promising newcomer in her early Australian days (Dead Calm, Flirting) and has given some good performances in recent films such as The Others, Cold Mountain and The Golden Compass. During her Mrs Cruise years, however, she seemed to struggle, perhaps under the burden of trying to prove that she was something more than the beautiful trophy wife of a big name, the Bo Derek of the nineties. Even in a film as good as Eyes Wide Shut she failed to shine, and many of her other films (Far and Away, Batman Forever, The Peacemaker) were very dull affairs. Practically Tragic, however, must be one of her worst, down in the pits with the ghastly Moulin Rouge.Why do I hate this film? Well, let me count the ways. The film might deal with things magical, but there is little magic about the dull and turgid script. The plot is particularly preposterous, even by the standards of most films dealing with the supernatural, the ending being particularly nonsensical. Given that most people these days do not believe in magic, a fantasy of this nature can only succeed if the audience can be persuaded to suspend their disbelief, and that is something this film singularly fails to do. Neither Kidman as Gillian nor Sandra Bullock ever manages to make their characters believable, or even very likable. Many films about the supernatural- the Harry Potter movies are a good example- use magic as a metaphor for the human condition; the witch or wizard may have superhuman abilities, but still has the human knowledge of good and evil and the human responsibility to choose between them. There is no hint of that here; the film seems to take place in a moral vacuum.My biggest problem with the film, however, was that it just did not know what attitude to take towards its subject-matter, whether to take it seriously or as a subject for comedy. It is a hodge-podge of various film genres, borrowing something of the conventions of each one, and ending up as an unattractive hybrid, neither fish nor flesh nor fowl nor good red herring. Some of the time the film is played for laughs, but it is hard to regard as a comedy (except perhaps a very black one) a film which includes in an early scene shots of a young husband and father being mown down by a truck in front of his wife. This board describes the film as a Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Mystery / Romance, which can be extended to Comedy / Drama / Fantasy / Mystery / Romance / Horror / Thriller / Feminist Tract. (The scenes between Sally and Jimmy read like a poor man's Thelma and Louise). If this film were a person it would have a severe case of multiple personality disorder. 3/10 "}{"Title":"Mild magic...","Date":"30 December 2006","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are well-cast as estranged sisters in the present day who reunite, only to become involved in a murder, covering their tracks while dodging an out-of-town cop who's hot on the case. After rocketing to stardom with her co-starring role in Speed, Sandra Bullock has struggled with her celebrity and the results on-screen have been mixed, to say the least (While You Were Sleeping was cute, but I barely made it through 28 Days, which felt like it). Practical Magic is a mild fantasy with dramatic and comedic overtones, admirably more of a character-study than a special effects-induced outing (which probably turned many viewers off). The attempt is certainly there, the production design is handsome, but the characters don't really come off. Bullock is truly appealing, though Kidman and Aidan Quinn have very little to work with, and the supporting actresses (Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest) are forgettable, much like the film. It's a time-filler, leaving no lasting impression. *1/2 from **** "},{"Title":"Good performances - dull, confused story","Date":"21 December 2001","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":"  Sally and Gillian are raised as witches by their aunts Frances and Bridget.  Gillian moves away as an adult for a life of fun, while Sally stays in their small town and marries her true love.  However a curse on the family takes Sally's husband and she finds herself back with her two daughters living with her aunts. When Gillian is beaten by her boyfriend Jimmy, Sally helps her leave him but they accidentally kill him.  A spell to bring him back goes wrong and they bury him in the yard however his spirit remains to haunt them.This had promise - a good director, good cast and interesting premise.  However the story is all over the place - it wants to be a romance, a ghost story, a thriller and a comedy of sorts, but it fails at all of these.  The romances aren't given time to develop - mainly because there are no strong male characters to care about.  The comedy is very light and helps the film have a whimsical feel - but it's not actually funny.  The ghost story doesn't work because the mood of the film is too light and it's all too easily sorted out.  That doesn't leave anything to focus on in terms of story.However the film has a certain amount of charm, some of it comes from the mood of the film which is quite gentle but most of it comes from the cast.  Bullock is really good as Sally and carries the majority of the film, Kidman is not as good as Gillian but is still good.  Sterling support is given by Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest as the aunts.  The two male leads Quinn and ER's Visnijic are likeable (in as much as Visnjic's character can be described as likeable!) but their characters are so shallow that they can only really play stereotypes of good man/bad man.Overall it's pretty disappointing - not having a good plot is a real downer - but a great performance by Bullock and Kidman and good support by Channing and Wiest almost make this worth watching.

Why would they try to bring Jimmy back to life, only to kill him again?  Why couldn't Gillian just hop on a bus and go back home after she had drugged Jimmy? And then there is the whole margarita scene which was just horrendous.  How are the two aunts gonna be practically drop-dead drunk, and then as soon as Gillian smashed the wine bottle they became sober and completely serious?  They should have tied them leaving into something else.  And then when Gillian is getting exorcised, she comes back to normal because they do the blood sisters thing and hug?  No....Now lets talk about how atrocious that acting in the movie was.  Let's start with Jimmy (Goran Visnjic).  I might have possibly gotten the worst role in the movie.  So he dies so he turns into a ghost that can posses people.  Then there.  The characters that were REALLY bad in this movie were Sally's daughters, Kylie and Antonia Owens (Evan Rachel Wood, and Alexandra Artrip).  They were just too happy about every single thing that they did (e.g., when they were pouring out the bad syrup into the ocean).  And in the scene where they were crying, it sounded like they were laughing/choking on something.  I know that Evan Rachel Wood can do better than this, because she was great on 'Digging to China.'  I have never seen the other girl on anything...and after being in this movie, she will probably never get another role.  She was cute though...The love connection between Bullock and Quinn must have been strictly positional because there was no chemistry that would lead them to almost having sex in the movie...unless Quinn just thought Bullock was THAT good looking.  They barely spoke, and then they get married.  And of course that lifts the spell that couldn't be lifted in thousands of years.  The movie is just one corn fest.  Don't even waste 100 minutes of your valuable time watching this.  Because you will regret it.

What I found was a silly and stupid movie. Sandra Bullock is bad as always. Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest are good actresses but here they are very superficial as the two old witches. And Nicole Kidman... Oh, is she the same Nicole Kidman of Eyes Wide Shut? I can't believe...The first half of the film is quite good and has a nice story. But the second half is just annoying and ridiculous, specially the last 20 minutes.4/10  "},{"Title":"Complete Garbage","Date":"28 June 2004","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","Review":" If you hate men you'll like this movie. Movie is actually a complement to this heap of dung. The writers of this pile (Robin Swicord and Ariva Goldman) must have been those girls in high-school that never got asked out on a date, and as a result now, as bitter adults, they get to spew feminist venom all over the the silver screen. That's all this film is. A complete mess at that. It's billed as a Comedy- Drama but there is not a single funny thing in it, unless you think that killing an abusive man is funny. And of course; all men are either rapists or wusses, don't you know?A waste of time. "}]
