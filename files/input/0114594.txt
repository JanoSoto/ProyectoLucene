Guy, played by Whaley, is a Hollywood rookie with no real experience but some lofty goals.  The movie charts his learning of the ways of Hollywood through becoming an assistant for fastidious big-shot producer Buddy Ackerman (Spacey), and his subsequent unlearning of the 'normal' moral values that apply almost anywhere else.  A remarkable performance from Spacey who is by turns searingly offensive, scathingly funny and (funnily enough) vividly human.  Making an audience feel for such a revolting character is a feat not many could accomplish, but Spacey's up to the task. Frank Whaley (possibly known to you through a bit part in 'Pulp Fiction') also turns in a very strong performance as the disillusioned young assistant who falls in love (or rather, in bed) with a female producer played by the sultry Michelle Forbes.  Spacey and Whaley's interplay in key scenes is riveting, and for the most part, the younger Whaley manages to stay out of Spacey's shadow.The movie's ending is quite unforeseeable, and its message can be construed either as darkly humorous satire against Hollywood, or as a nihilistic comment on the ways of mankind.  Judging by the not-so-humorous tone of the movie (though ludicrously enough it was marketed as a comedy), to me it feels like the latter applies.  Definitely worth seeing, even if only for Spacey.  8/10  "},{"Title":"For anyone who's ever had a vindictive boss - or a job at all, for that matter","Date":"12 July 2005","Score":"35 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Swimming with Sharks was made right around the time Kevin Spacey was becoming a rising star - his name was becoming well known enough that he could help finance low budget movies. Along with The Usual Suspects he helped Swimming with Sharks get off the ground, and now ten years later (it was given wide release in 1995) it still holds up well as a very, very dark comedy.In fact, comedy isn't the right word. This shouldn't really be classified as comedy. It's not that funny. It works better as a dark satire - I expected something like War of the Roses, but instead I got a Tarantino version of Office Space (complete with torture, violence, revenge and mayhem!).Frank Whaley stars as Guy, a typical nobody who dreams of being a somebody. (Even his name confines him to anonymity.) When he lands a job working for world-famous producer Buddy Ackerman (Spacey), his future looks bright...until he realizes what he's in for.Spacey delivers the best performance of the film, yelling, screaming, and throwing hissy fits practically every time he's on screen. But he never pushes the limits. He's always believable as a self-absorbed, ego-maniacal, ruthless producer; the director claims on the DVD commentary track and documentaries that he based the character and many scenes on actual things that happened to him while he worked for unnamed producers in Hollywood. Joel Silver is rumored to have been the basis for Ackerman.The movie isn't great and never really achieves the amount of laughs I wanted but if you view it as a very dark drama-comedy you're more likely to enjoy it. I still found myself quite entertained and taken aback by how daring and unique this movie actually is - no one can condemn it for resorting to clich√©s. The ending is a punch in the stomach, I never expected it.Whaley is good at playing the over/underwhelmed everyman and the direction is OK (if just so). The best aspects are the witty script and Kevin Spacey's scene-stealing performance; together he has good chemistry with Whaley and the movie succeeds based on the actors' success in their roles.

This is something that's made very easy to do by the acting. Kevin Spacey is typically excellent as Buddy Ackerman and is the most engaging character in the film, remaining funny and manipulative throughout, even while being tortured and held hostage, as well as handling the more serious emotional aspects of his character expertly. Frank Whaley is also brilliant, playing the overwhelmed lapdog who is eventually pushed over the edge by Buddy's abuse. Importantly however, despite his plans for revenge, he remains under Buddy's spell right up until the end, and is eventually broken.The film's conclusion further complicates our responses to both characters. The hostage situation revelations pull the audience between the impassioned-now-heartless Buddy and the desperate and confused Guy, but ultimately good does not prevail, and the shooting and Buddy's manipulation of the situation remove us from both characters as the film ends.All in all, Swimming with Sharks is an enjoyable film. The simple plot and small cast are compensated for by some fine performances; it's funny , well-acted, and definitely worth watching.

Ostensibly a damning look at the inner workings of the film business, Swimming with Sharks just as accurately depicts any highly dysfunctional employer/employee/associate relationships, and that's a lot of them.But even more than that, there is a lot of mostly unstated philosophical material underpinning much of the film, some of it literal and some more metaphorical, such as the ending. One of the key lines of dialogue towards this end is Ackerman's, If you're not a rebel by 21, you've got no heart, and if you haven't gone establishment by 30, you've got no brain.Ackerman obviously has problems or he wouldn't be acting quite in the way that he is, but director George Huang and Spacey are also careful to show that Ackerman has a lot more going on than surface behavior--he's acting the way that he is purposefully, both to get his due now as part of the establishment and to coyly manipulate his young, meek and abused underling, Guy (Frank Whaley), along with everyone else he comes into contact with. His aim is to mold Guy in a particular way--a way that works even though Guy thinks that he's severely breaking form in the extended penultimate scene that's intercut with Guy and Ackerman's history.Huang shows professional relationships as consisting mostly of politicking and manipulation. That's true at every level--certainly even Guy is doing this. There is very little authenticity to anyone in their working relationships. That seems pretty accurate to me, unfortunately. It's notable that the one dream of authenticity in the film--Guy talking about moving to Wyoming with Dawn (Michelle Forbes)--is treated and dispensed with as an unreachable fantasy, and it's also notable (and is fairly literally pointed out in the film) that Dawn, the one character who tries to demand being more authentic amidst the shark infested waters of the professional world, basically never gets anywhere.In the highly metaphorical ending of the film, things remain manipulative, political and backstabbing, and in that climate, at least two out of three characters win. Huang seems to be suggesting that the professional world ain't likely to change any time soon, and that even if you try to change it or manipulate the game itself, you're likely to just get eaten up by it, processed by it and incorporated into it anyway. Again, I can't say I disagree with him.

Not that there is any secret to be revealed here - pretty much everything you need to know about the soulless, spirit-crushing side of movie-making is contained in Raymond Chnadler's 1945 essay Writer's in Hollywood, which contains more horror than any of the celluloid parodies it has since inspired.Swimming with Sharks is the tale of innocent Guy (a freshly scrubbed Frank Whaley), whose monster boss is tinsel town king-maker Buddy Ackerman, a screaming, mood-shifting bully who dangles just enough opportunity before Guy to keep him on his leash. But payback is due, and comes in spades.It is all very dark and delicious, and Spacey gets to rip loose as the psycho boss, the joke being that it is his very lack of sanity and compassion that allows him to thrive in the business. Love interest is supplied by producer Dawn (Michelle Forbes), who allows Guy to stay grounded as he negotiates his way to the top. Dawn and Guy show us that even in Hollywood true love can conquer all - or can it? It is received wisdom that movies about movies don't travel very well. Swimming with Sharks is about delusion and corruption, and how much the human spirit can take. It just happens to be set in Hollywood, but Buddy Ackerman could be Gordon Gecko in a different market. Worth watching to see Spacey enjoying himself in a role where he gets to say pretty much whatever he likes, and does so with relish.

However, in the early 90s, a new trend began to emerge - films which delved below the glossy exterior of Hollywood and began to expose more negative aspects of the industry. One would be hard pressed to find as fitting an example of this Hollywood introspective neo- realism as writer/director George Huang's semi-autobiographical (but hopefully only to an extent...) Swimming With Sharks - a biting, cynical look at the interior of the film industry which challenges the preconceptions of the industry and its bleak aims.Like Robert Altman's The Player, Swimming with Sharks offers a harshly critical commentary on the corporate moneymaking machine that is Hollywood, but from the opposite end the perspective of a low level assistant striving to rise in the ranks. However, similar to Altman's work, Huang's film dabbles with the notion of being a black comedy or darkly satirical take on the business end of the film industry, but ultimately lacks the acerbic wit needed to succeed on such a front. As such, while the occasional moment of darkly gleeful comedic insight may derived, for the most part, the film falters on attempted darkly ironic comedic moments which come across as too heavy handed to be truly funny. The film's main strength is in its strictly dramatic climax; its harrowing and powerful turn of events toying with notions of all consuming ambition and free will in a truly gripping fashion. Combined with a numbingly unexpected and chilling ending scene, the film's finale is easily its strongest point - enough so to carry the occasional botched comic moment from earlier in the film. However, Tom Heil's understated and affecting single piano score and the occasional moment of intriguing cinematography also add to the overall quality of the work. Kevin Spacey is the main pleasure to behold here as the film's main selling point, the boss from Hell figure Buddy Ackerman. Alternating between wryly funny, starkly powerful and disconcertingly human, Spacey, though disappointingly denied the ability to chew the scenery quite as much as one might hope for, easily walks away with the picture with his top notch work. Frank Whaley gives an adequate performance as the constantly put upon assistant who finally seeks revenge, though his character is given next to no development and Whaley lacks the engaging charisma needed to really sell the role. Michelle Forbes also comes across as disappointingly flat as an ambitious business woman caught between Spacey and Whaley, though she shines in certain scenes. Watch also for an early appearance by Benicio Del Toro in a tiny role as Whaley's predecessor. While it may falter as the black comedy it clearly wants to be throughout, the film excels as the harshly critical drama it becomes by the end. An undeniably maliciously enjoyable performance by Spacey keeps the film afloat, and while it may occasionally come across as lopsided or falling short of its potential, Swimming with Sharks keeps enough surprises up its proverbial sleeve to remain interesting throughout as a cynical treatise on ambition and the film industry which thrives upon it. -7/10 "},{"Title":"Delightful discovery","Date":"19 December 2010","Score":"7 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" I was so depressed after watching The Men Who Stare At Goats that I actively sought out Kevin Spacey movies to help redeem my perceptions of him.

This low-cost(less than $1M) film must not have had a very big marketing budget -- it completely escaped me at the time -- but it's one of the best performances Kevin Spacey I've ever seen. An abusive, self-indulgent, arrogant boss in the film industry, his role easily translates into that of a recognizable evil boss in any field. Spacey nicely runs the gamut of expression from god-like to humbled. His once-idealistic assistant is played by Frank Whaley, who never really saw his full potential subsequently develop in his career but has had nice turns in Pulp Fiction and a number of high-production TV series. Whaley too should be commended for his ability to grow the character from a wide-eyed beginning his dream job, to a vengeful warrior out for blood. The film centers on the dysfunctional relationship between these two and is weak only when it attempts to introduce minor roles featuring Michelle Forbes (Maryann on True Blood) and Benecio del Toro (though these actors perform well with what they've been given).

Swimming With Sharks seems to owe more than a little something to Dilbert. The movie is more about Corporate America than Hollywood. There are a lot of white-collar touches that apply to offices, cubicles and other such rather than the Hollywood spin machine. Like Robert Altman's The Player, this is one of those thrillers about people in the biz who are driven to the breaking point by how cruel L.A. can really be.The film's writer/director George Huang himself was a former personal assistant to some of the biggest names in Hollywood, has described the movie as 20% autobiographical. Much of this one is said to be based on his experience working for noted mega-mogul producer Joel Silver for Columbia Pictures. So it should come as no surprise what-so-ever that his first crack at film was his own life story.Surprise, surprise, huh? Well, more or less.Despite Kevin Spacey being the big name in this movie and him getting first-billing, Frank Whaley (Career Opportunities) is the star of this one. Most of anything with him head-lining is a sign of a bad movie (Cold Dog Soup and The Jimmy Show), but this is one of those where he shines because he's allowed to. He's not the most versatile actor, the best-looking or the most charismatic. He's had a rep as being something of the life-long bit player. But when he's given a movie, script and part which allows him any headway, he damn well manages to make the most of it.Spacey, being one of Hollywood's finest and renown, is able to pull off the screaming antagonistic drill-instructor and the restrained, tortured hostage here pitch perfectly. Whaley effectively plays the green, naive wide-eyed rookie to the Hollywood roulette wheel with his usual perfection, but when the other shoe drops, he doesn't quite pull off the scorned, disgruntled employee seeking revenge. His Jekyll isn't as convincing as his Hyde. He doesn't scare us. He never seems truly unhinged. Maybe that's why Whaley sticks to the youthful deer-in-the-headlights. Whaley doesn't really seem as demented and unhinged as he should in his captor scenes. He's best as a whipping boy--which is why he plays so many.1994 was the official year for Spacey. He got his breakout with the TV series Wiseguys, and made the big screen transition with worthwhile fare like his Oscar-winning supporting role in The Usual Suspects, The Ref, Se7en and this. Spacey monopolized himself in the '94 as absolute talent (my term).Benecio Del Toro, the Brad Pitt of Mexico (someone else's quote, believe me, I never dubbed him such) has a quickie cameo as Spacey's assistant who's given his three weeks' notice and is on the way out, making way for Guy. But not before giving Whaley some final parting words of wisdom. Protect his interests, serve his needs. What you think means nothing. What you feel means nothing. You have no brain. He yells all the time. It's a lose-lose situation. This job is a fast-track shortcut to the top and if Guy does right and keeps his mouth open wide to catch all of Buddy's crap, he may very well be someday on the same mantel as Buddy and his former assistants. Everything Guy'll ever need to know about his job, he learns on day one.Enter Dawn Locklard (Michelle Forbes of Guiding Light and 24), another powerful Hollywood producer who Guy doesn't have the best first meeting with. She doesn't show a lot of warmth, which explains why she's a producer.She herself is angry and cynical, and throughout the course of the film, we will see why. She eventually warms up to Guy and asks him out. Guy is stunned. But she needs Buddy on her side and is interested in him getting behind her new project. Guy sees this as an opportunity. Her new project for the studio, Real Life may just be Guy's window of opportunity. She seems to be interested in Guy because he's the most real thing she's seen in the Valley for the longest time. But does she really feel something for him or is she just using him? Is Buddy two- faced and back-stabbing or is Dawn? Guy no longer knows what's real and what's what? Although when Guy starts to show some spine after a lot of Buddy's tantrums, the payoff is almost evenly matched with the faux-sugar scene. Buddy gets to emotionally, verbally (and at times, physically) abuses Guy (and apparently all his assistant's) on every possible occasion. He also gets to skewer just about everyone who crosses his path.Swimming With Sharks is no featherweight comedy for a slow night about a bullying boss like the trailer lead you to believe. It's a film which deals with white-collar office comedy and torturous drama. Shifting from a lightweight comedy to a torturous thriller. It's sort of schizophrenic thing. We're laughing heartily one minute and horrified the next. A lot of time, this one keeps us guessing as it criss-crosses from Buddy torturing Guy to vice-versa.But there's a lot (maybe too much) about this one that rings too-true to life. A lot of moments filled with the harsh insights and disillusioned truths that one learns from living an uncharmed life. And so there's illuminating light and lessons, as well as laughs. Not to mention some great heavier moments where ugly secrets about Buddy and... well, surprisingly Dawn are revealed.The plot is over-developed and the ending is more poetic than anything else.

I recall a closed door argument between a company vice-president and one of his subordinate directors, and the underling was no guy/Guy like Frank Whaley's character. You could hear the two yelling at each other across the office before the thing settled down. Fortunately it was so early in the morning most of the staff wasn't in to work yet, but it was quite the show for anyone there.Kevin Spacey excels in an early starring role as the sadistic Buddy Ackerman. The thing is however, he exhibits a disconcerting aura of warmth and humanity at times that runs counter to his normal behavior. His is not the role model they talk about in business school, in fact it was almost refreshing to hear his diatribe about having to work one's way up instead of expecting to start at the top with an expectation of entitlement.You know, for some odd reason I had the impression that Guy was going to shoot Dawn (Michelle Forbes) instead of Buddy, seeing as how he had already endured a year of Buddy's vengeful and abusive behavior.

Those who are given a chance to become initiates are sometimes subjected to a kind of hazing process in which the poor initiate is subjected to the whims of the high elites.Kevin Spacey plays Buddy Ackerman, the perfect Hollywood shark, a studio executive who believes everything he says and does should be viewed as gospel by those who work under him. Guy (Frank Whaley) is his new assistant, or better stated, his new whipping boy. Guy is greener than an unripe tomato, replacing Rex (Benicio del Toro) of whom Buddy says is a good for nothing mongoloid on the first day. But before the first day is over, Guy realizes that this is going to be long term abuse.Spacey makes the perfect vain studio executive. One of the best aspects of his performance is that he wavers between seeming reasonable than flying into rages which would give your average wolverine a runs for its money. He berates Guy for giving him the wrong artificial sweetener. He throws books and papers at him. Even occasionally food. He even makes his assistant embark on impossible tasks, such as destroying every single copy of a Time Magazine issue which contained a scathing article about him. Ackerman's motto is You are nothing. You're opinion means nothing.As book ends to the narrative, we flash to another part of the story Guy has kidnapped Ackerman and has tied him. He's torturing him as payback. But the abuse is not the only reason Guy wants Buddy to suffer. As bad as Guy's mistreatment, the worst aspect is the executive's habit of taking credit for the deeds of others. In a poignant scene, Ackerman pretends to praise Guy to another executive, but Guy realizes it was false.A very interesting film, mostly for those who have either worked for or been associated with ego-maniacs. The movie industry is chock full of people who believe they are above everyone else because of certain successes. This gives some of them license to abuse others, particularly because so many desire what few positions are available. As Buddy himself says Life is not a movie. Good guys lose, everybody lies, and love... does not conquer all.

Keeping this vague enough to not reveal any spoilers... I thought if the entire movie had been a comedy, like the first half, it could have been truly hilarious.  If the movie had been like the second half, we could have had a really good, serious tragedy.Instead, the first half (and the fact that the movie is billed as a comedy) sets us up to be in a lighthearted mood and to want to see bad things happen to Kevin Spacey, and then the second half makes him sympathetic and brutalizes us in our vulnerable state into feeling bad for him.Overall, I finished watching the movie pretty unsatisfied about everything. The hilarious punch-line I was waiting for at the end of the movie never happened and instead I was made to feel guilty about rooting for Whaley's character in the beginning.To be fair, the movie might be a completely satisfying and worthwhile experience if one goes into it knowing that it isn't a straightforward boss-bashing comedy.

Many of his other roles are rather sedate and reserved such as KPAX or Se7en, but this one is more like his role in the Negotiator. The mark of a good actor is his ability to competently act in any genre of film and Spacey has this ability. The rest of the cast was also very good in their roles making the film good for viewers. The film is about cut-throat movie producer Buddy Ackerman (Spacey) who brutally indoctrinates his assistant Guy (Whaley) into the world of film making. Most everyone really wants to see someone put the tyrant Ackerman in his place. Guy can only take so much though. By the time the film ends, the viewer is thankful but surprised.

I read reviews with almost all of them saying it dragged in the middle. DRAGGED? No way! This movie had me laughing, squirming in my chair, and feeling sad all at the same time. A rollercoaster, a complete ride. And the ending! eek That was probably the one ending I DIDN'T even consider. Wow. What a great film.One comment I would like to make real quickly on a personal note. I am a Kevin Spacey fan, and when you think you've seen it all, you just watch some of his movies. I hadn't seen this movie yet and I had heard from other fans that it was a favorite, so I was a little worried about it meeting expectations. Never doubt this man's ability!Ok, so let's talk about Buddy, shall we? Well, I don't think there is anyone on this earth who could see this movie and not realize how great of an actor Kevin Spacey is. I just don't. This performance is so unique, not just of Kevin's roles, but of almost any role. At first, Buddy's just funny. And I think he remains funny throughout the film. But he also gets progressively more evil and demeaning. This character is one that you would just want to... well, torture. And so I can see where Guy is coming from. Then, there is something else. Something I think only Kevin could manage to bring to this role- sympathy. Maybe no one else felt it, but I sure did. I felt sorry for Buddy. A wild thing to feel, I know. But somehow Kevin just plays with your emotions. He makes you feel sorry for the biggest jerk ever. Because you realize as the movie goes on that Buddy might not have ended up that way had Hollywood not been like it is (at least this theoretical Hollywood.)This is where I think this movie is totally the biggest bash on Hollywood ever made. It's just so revealing of how everyone is striving for their own thing and will do whatever it takes to get there. It's such a horrible attitude! It's what made Buddy like he is and in the end it's what drives Guy to resort to killing Dawn to climb the ladder. A question. Do you think that Buddy knew what Guy was going to do in the end? I think it's obvious that Dawn didn't, but what about Buddy? Let me make some comments on the ending of this movie. There are several possible things that could have happened as I see itGuy kills Buddy- Buddy wins, Guy goes to jail Guy kills Himself- Buddy wins, Guy is dead Guy doesn't kill anyone- Buddy wins, Guy goes to jail and his career is ruined Guy kills Dawn- Buddy wins, Guy wins, Dawn is deadSo basically, Guy could have picked a scenario in which he owned up to what he did, or accepted punishment, or just ended it for himself (not saying that's right). But instead, Guy picks the one way that he can escape scott free. No matter what Guy did, Buddy was going to win. Either by going back to his job or by ruining Guy's life or both. So he decided he would compromise. He would take an innocent person's life for his own good. He listened to Buddy. He let that scumbag get inside his head! (Like I said, Buddy is scum, but I do feel sorry for him because he has had some things happen to him which have made him think that being nice always make you lose.) What do you really want? Buddy asks him, time and time again. I think the end makes us realize, he wasn't asking what Guy wanted of him, but what Guy wanted for himself. He says he wants Dawn. He says he wants love, a normal life. He says he wants respect. But in the end, are those things what he really wants? No. Hollywood, the glamor and appeal of it has gotten to him just like the hardened men and women who went before him. He no longer really cares about being respected or loved. He cares about getting ahead. So what was Guy's mistake? I think his mistake was wanting the one thing he wanted. What did Guy want? He wanted to be Buddy. And in the end, he was.

But before he can get to the top of the studio he will first half to pay his dues, and that means being the lowly assistant to cruel egotistical producer Buddy Ackerman. (played by Kevin Spacey.) And Guy quickly learns that it's going to be the most miserable part of his life, because Buddy is incredibly demanding, constantly changing his mind, and show's no mercy even for the slightest mistakes. But as Guy begins to adjust to his new lifestyle, he begins to fall in love with another producer, Dawn Lockard. (played by Michelle Forbes.) And as their relationship develops, Guy slowly becomes more and more frustrated with Buddy until he finally decides to get revenge.Swimming with Sharks fits right in with other 90s films like Office Space, Fight Club, and Falling Down. Films about how working class males were not satisfied with were life had got them and resort to desperate measures to change it. Swimming with Sharks takes a very comedic approach to this subject, but at the same time a very dark one. Kevin Spacey nails the performance of Buddy Ackerman perfectly, but then again it's Kevin Spacey, what would you expect? I can't remember the last time I saw a character that was as vicious cruel and heartless as Buddy Ackerman. This gives every scene in the film an underlying tension because you never know when Buddy will lose his temper next. A lot of Buddy's dialogue is great as well. The scene were he compares Guy to other objects in the office might be the best in the whole film. Just because of the clever writing and vicious performance.Unfortunately towards the end of the film, they try to get you to sympathize with Buddy, and while the idea for it makes sense, (Buddy had to pay his dues as well, and now as he says in the film, it's my turn to be selfish.) it really comes off as incredibly forced. I get that Buddy was supposed to be a good guy that was turned bad by the Hollywood system, but the way the execute is so out of the blue and melodramatic, that when they first started doing it, I thought it was a joke. Another problem I have with the film is that the other two leads seem so weak when compared with Kevin Spacey, don't get me wrong neither of them or bad, and Frank Whaley is able to pull of his character fairly well, and has some good line delivery. But on a whole the other leads just aren't anywhere close to Kevin Spacey, which makes them seem a lot worse than they actually are. The film also jumps the shark, (pun intended) at the end, it goes way over the top and its themes get kind of muddled in all the pointless melodrama, but luckily it's able to bring them back for the very final scene of the film.But overall I would say Swimming with Sharks is a pretty solid film, it has its weaker parts, but none of them are bad enough to ruin the film. Swimming with Sharks has become a cult comedy, in the same way Office Space has become one. Both films resonated with audiences at the time, and for a good reason. Swimming with Sharks is a film that portrays greed and the harsh truths of the world in a funny way.

The one other significant character is a producer named Dawn Lockard (Michelle Forbes), who also abuses Guy when they first meet until she finds out that he works for Buddy, which she knows is bad enough.The story is actually told in flashback, from when Guy has taken Buddy hostage, in a scenario somewhat reminiscent of Nine to Five. But while that film is a fairly conventional comedy, this film is a pitch black comedy, and is not for all tastes. What makes it all work is Kevin Spacey, who you can really believe is a monster given how well he inhabits the Buddy character. The writing, by the director (George Huang, who was once such an assistant himself), is also very good, and apparently is real enough that many people have thought that the Buddy character is based on their bosses, even though he is really a composite of many people.Seen at the San Francisco International Film Festival on 4/24/2002 following an interview and lively question and answer session with the star, who chose this film to be screened.

I had to watch the ending twice to fully understand what I saw. The DVD is fine, but being a 1994 movie it does not have 5-channel surround sound, and the extras are very limited. On the surface the story appears to be about Buddy. However, it is really about his assistant and the transformation he makes.CAUTION -- SPOILERS FOLLOW --This is a perfect role for Kevin Spacey as the executive who looks at every transaction as a zero sum exercise. Someone has to WIN, and someone has to LOSE, even though his personalized plate says WIN-WIN. That is part of the satire. Buddy always wants to win, and his personal assistant is there for only reason -- to help him win.The story is told in flashback form. Fairly early we see Buddy apparently held hostage by his abused assistant, and a series of flashbacks explain how he came to that state. Ultimately it was a phone call that early in the movie we only hear part of. Buddy had accidentally patched his assistant into a call which included the assistant's girlfriend, who on the phone agreed to go over to Buddy's place for sex. Finally faced with Buddy tied up and bleeding in his chair, and his girlfriend standing nearby, Buddy insisting do it, go ahead, you know what you have to do,, and we hear a gunshot followed by a blank screen.Turns out he killed his girlfriend, Buddy corroborated a concocted story that the girlfriend was torturing him and the assistant shot her to save Buddy. As the movie ends, we see the equivalent of the assistant having sold his soul to the devil, who in this film is Buddy. He has REALLY become Buddy's servant, but has been promoted and is on his way to the top. Sacrificing everything he once held to be good and true, for fame and fortune in the movie business.I must admit that it was pleasant to watch the assistant get revenge for the totally abusive way Buddy treated him, but the overall message, even though it is satire, is a difficult story to warm up to. Still, I suppose there are people in all businesses who sacrifice part or all of their values to get ahead in business.  Come to think of it, I used to work with several of them! If this film had been made with the same message, and had not relied so much on foul language throughout, I probably would have rated it 8 or 9. Resorting to only curse words to convey an emotion is the sign of weak script writing.

The Inside Dope On Hollywood Off Of The Red Carpet.","Date":"9 January 2009","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" by Dane Youssef Now here is a movie for those looking for an attack on white-collar corporate office life, the spinning gears of Hollywood. Swimming With Sharks seems to owe more than a little something to Dilbert. The movie is more about Corporate America than Hollywood. There are a lot of white-collar touches that apply to offices, cubicles and other such rather than the Hollywood spin machine. Like Robert Altman's The Player, this is one of those thrillers about people in the biz who are driven to the breaking point by how cruel L.A. can really be.The film's writer/director George Huang himself was a former personal assistant to some of the biggest names in Hollywood, has described the movie as 20% autobiographical. Much of this one is said to be based on his experience working for noted mega-mogul producer Joel Silver for Columbia Pictures. So it should come as no surprise what-so-f**king-ever that his first crack at film was his own life story.Surprise, surprise, huh? Well, more or less.Despite Kevin Spacey being the big name in this movie and him getting first-billing, Frank Whaley (Career Opportunities) is the star of this one. Most of anything with him head-lining is a sign of a bad movie (Cold Dog Soup and The Jimmy Show), but this is one of those where he shines because he's allowed to. He's not the most versatile actor, the best-looking or the most charismatic. He's had a rep as being something of the life-long bit player. But when he's given a movie, script and part which allows him any headway, he damn well manages to make the most of it.Spacey, being one of Hollywood's finest and renown, is able to pull off the screaming antagonistic drill-instructor and the restrained, tortured hostage here pitch perfectly. Whaley effectively plays the green and naive wide-eyed rookie to the Hollywood spin machine with his usual perfection, but when the other shoe drops, he doesn't quite pull off the scorned, disgruntled employee seeking revenge. His Jeckyll isn't as convincing as his Hyde. He doesn't scare us. He never seems truly unhinged. Maybe that's why Whaley sticks to the youthful deer-in-the-headlights. Whaley doesn't really seem as demented and unhinged as he should in his captor scenes. He's best as a whipping boy--which is why he plays so many.1994 was the official year for Spacey. He got his breakout with the TV series Wiseguys, and made the big screen transition with worthwhile fare like his Oscar-winning supporting role in The Usual Suspects, The Ref, Se7en and this. Spacey monopolized himself in the '94 as absolute talent (my term).Benecio Del Toro, the Brad Pitt of Mexico (someone else's quote, believe me, I never dubbed him such) has a quickie cameo as Spacey's assistant who's given his three weeks notice and is on the way out, making way for Guy. But not before giving Whaley some final parting words of wisdom. Protect his interests, serve his needs. What you think means nothing. What you feel means nothing. You have no brain. He yells all the time. It's a lose-lose situation. This job is a fast-track shortcut to the top and if Guy does right and keeps his mouth open wide to catch all of Buddy's crap, he may very well be someday on the same mantel as Buddy and his former assistants. Everything Guy'll ever need to know about his job, he learns on day one.Enter Dawn Locklard (Michelle Forbes of Guiding Light and 24), another powerful Hollywood producer who Guy doesn't have the best first meeting with. She doesn't show a lot of warmth, which explains why she's a producer.She herself is angry and cynical, and throughout the course of the film, we will see why. She eventually warms up to Guy and asks him out. Guy is stunned. But she needs Buddy on her side and is interested in him getting behind her new project. Guy sees this as an opportunity. Her new project for the studio, Real Life may just be Guy's window of opportunity. She seems to be interested in Guy because he's the most real thing she's seen in the Valley for the longest time. But does she really feel something for him or is she just using him? Is Buddy two-faced and back-stabbing or is Dawn? Guy no longer knows what's real and what's what? Although when Guy starts to show some spine after a lot of Buddy's tantrums, the payoff is almost evenly matched with the artificial sugar scene. Buddy gets to emotionally, verbally (and at times, physically) abuses Guy (and apparently all his assistant's) on every possible occasion. He also gets to skewer just about everyone who crosses his path.Swimming With Sharks isn't a featherweight comedy for a slow night about a bullying boss like the trailer lead you to believe. It's a film which deals with white-collar office comedy and torturous drama. Shifting from a lightweight comedy to a torturous thriller. It's sort of schizophrenic thing. We're laughing heartily one minute and horrified the next. A lot of time, this one keeps us guessing as it criss-crosses from Buddy torturing Guy to vice-versa.But there's a lot to this movie (maybe too much) about this movie that rings true to life. A lot of moments filled with the harsh insights and disillusioned truths that one learns from living an uncharmed life. And so there's illuminating light and lessons, as well as laughs.

It's bit shocking that this sort of thing goes on in that industry, but I've heard that the story is modeled after Joel Silver and since it was written by an insider, I believe some if not all of the story being told here have roots in reality.The movie had very limited showing (few theaters in NY and LA) when it was released in 1995, so most of us probably never seen it in theaters. The 2005 Lions Gate DVD release which this review is based on is very good, as it contains surprising amount of bonus material with comments from the producers, director and the actors, and for us who've never seen it in theaters provides satisfying viewing experience.This movie should be better known as a cult classic, since it is a great movie, and very original in concept. It's a portrayal of underside of Hollywood's movie making industry, and the crassness of the people are depicted with humor (when people take themselves so seriously, you can't help but to laugh at it), but also shows the very real cruelty of people who controls Hollywood. I guess that's the whole point of this movie. The movie hits the point in that it shows how intoxicated people with power will be with their own power, and it may not be as obvious, but a watered down version of this story goes on all over the world in our lives. If it were written in that vein, I think the movie would have had wider appeal and it might have been with the ranks of Taxi Driver and other movies that brought under dog's life to our attention.I hope another version of this movie be made this time not as such personal experience of a single man, but as universal truth about people who have been terrorized by their bosses and the way things are in our world in general. No one has taken this theme to this extent in the past, so cudos for the writer/director and producers of this movie. One of the must see movie in our life time.

Little did I realise that a relatively unknown Indie film called Swimming With Sharks, was circling my local video store long before American Beauty had ingrained itself in our collective psyche. I must confess, I only picked it up off the shelf because I saw Kevin Spacey's name on the cover - the hallmark of a great film. Besides which, the subject is one that I can closely identify with, having myself been an underpaid, overworked runner in a film company. Though I have never had to endure the same nightmarish ordeals as Buddy's downtrodden assistant, Guy, I have poured enough tea and coffee to put me off a career in film.Spacey gives a tour de force performance as the ruthless Buddy Ackerman, an egomaniacal Hollywood producer who is so demanding, so unbearable, it's hard to imagine lasting a day in his company. Enter Guy (Frank Whaley), a young film school graduate with vague aspirations of making it in the movies. But by the end of it, his priorities have changed so drastically that he has become everything he once despised.Much like Nicole Kidman's Machiavellian weather girl in the pitch black comedy, To Die For, Buddy will do whatever it takes to be successful, even if that means humiliating Guy, crushing his spirit, calling him a 'worthless piece of sh*t' on a daily basis, and a great deal of back-stabbing. But Guy shows great resolve in the face of such adversity and learns a thing or two about surviving in a 'kill or be killed' environment.Spacey's genius is finding pathos in Buddy's sadistic, cruel nature, so that by the time the audience gets to hear the reasons behind this fa√ßade, we almost feel sorry for the bastard! Whaley gives an equally impressive performance as the underdog, and the friction between these two characters is at once funny and depressing; of course, it's depressing to those who've never experienced it, and funny to those who have. This movie is not for the faint of heart, so if you're the kind of person who broke down in tears at the end of Titanic, then perhaps you'd better take a handful of valium before viewing.Guy's breaking point comes when he suspects his not-so-innocent girlfriend, Dawn (Michelle Forbes), is sleeping with his boss. Without wanting to give too much away and spoil the fun, I'll just say this Buddy gets his comeuppance in a series of flashbacks that culminate in the mother of all revenge scenes. However the ending is quite unexpected, and sends out rather a chilling message about the price we pay for success.Swimming With Sharks reads like a veritable assault on the film industry, exposing its dark underbelly of corruption, exploitation, manipulation and betrayal. I think that this will be quite unnerving to those who have only ever considered the glamour and prestige associated with the world of movies. It not only shines new light on this rather enigmatic subject, but also raises a sardonic eye to the abuse of power in the workplace, the inevitable politicking that comes as standard with most jobs.Technically, the film is quite limited due to time and budget constraints (it was made in less than three weeks for less than $3m), as the director explains in his commentary, but the story and the acting more than make up for this. I mean, ask yourself, how does a first-time director secure an actor of Spacey's calibre? Simple. With a fantastic script (as a side note, I'm glad they decided to change the film's title from its unimaginative beginnings as The Buddy Factor - which sounds better suited to Saturday morning TV - to the more ominous Swimming With Sharks).The DVDs only worthwhile feature is the director's commentary which is surprisingly candid, revealing many behind-the-scenes secrets, and it is told in a lively and entertaining manner. In fact I would go as far as saying that it's possibly the best commentary I've ever heard.

I first caught this film on late night TV up here in Canada, and I was amazed at how good it was, and how I could've missed it earlier. After that I spent the next four months searching every video store in Calgary for a copy to rent, eventually finding one in a small store on the other end of town. Once I took it home, I was ecstatic, popping it into the VCR immediately. It was as good... no, better than I remembered. I saw it five times that weekend.Spacey's portrayal of Buddy Ackerman, the boss from hell, is right on target, and will go down as his best performance up until 1999's 'American Beauty' (in my opinion it was better than Beauty, but the critics apparently didn't think so). Frank Whaley, as Guy, the films protagonist, is Spacey's equal, or pretty close, he gives a great, underrated performance here. Michelle Forbes and Benicio Del Toro also provide great support in two pivotal roles.The script couldn't have been better. The one liners fly in fast and furious, mixed in with some drama and a great ending, all wrapped up in an unconventional format, moving between the present and past effortlessly. George Huang's direction is also superb, he creates a great atmosphere and it lasts throughout the entire film, no small feat. It's too bad he hasn't gone on to bigger and better thinks yet, as he has a wealth of untapped talent.Still, despite the great acting, writing and direction, the best part may be the haunting piano music, which stays with you long as the film has ended. The most incredible part of it all is that the soundtrack only contains a single short track from the movie's score, with the rest coming from a random assortment of songs by famous artists that don't even appear in the movie.A brilliant, twisted character study, with an ending coming right out of the blue.

Thus begins `Swimming With Sharks,' a veritable survival guide for those who would venture into the cold and often dangerous waters of film making.  Guy is a recent film school graduate who has landed a job at Keystone Pictures as the gofer assistant to none other than the legendary power player Buddy Ackerman (Played exuberantly by Kevin Spacey), one of the top producers at Keystone.  Guy is replacing Rex (Benicio Del Toro) who is leaving to take a position at Paramount.  During Guy's orientation on his first day, Rex tells him `This in not a business, this is show business.  Punching below the belt in not only alright, it's rewarded,' and with that, the tone is set for much of what follows.  But not everything.  Buddy, we quickly learn, is the boss nobody would ever want. At his best, he is unpleasant; at his worst, which is most of the time, he is abusive in the extreme.  He seems to take perverse delight in assigning Catch-22 directives to his underlings (He tells Guy to hold his calls while he is in a meeting; when Guy doesn't put the calls through he is admonished for it).  His most prolific tool of management is the beguiling phrase `Shut up, listen, and learn,' which he applies frequently to the hapless Guy.  						Of course, there is only so much one man can take, and early on we realize that Guy is in the process of exacting his revenge.  Through flashbacks the story unfolds, and Guy's motivation becomes crystal clear.  A situation to which many can relate, it is readily understandable how he has arrived at the position in which he finds himself with Buddy, and  when you realize that Guy has crossed that line beyond which there is no return it evokes that sense of loss one feels for the doomed, and you wonder why things have to be like this. 											In `Swimming With Sharks,' writer and first time director George Huang serves up a delectable sampling of the smorgasbord that is Hollywood, complete with the bitters he adds to the twist at the end, which may leave you somewhat taken aback.  The supporting cast includes Michelle Forbes (in a noteworthy turn as producer Dawn Lockard, who comes to Guy and Buddy's table at what can only be termed an inopportune juncture), T.E. Russell as Foster Kane, and Roy Dotrice as Cyrus Miles.  To those who love movies, this film offers some insight into what it takes to bring those coveted images to the screen; but it is also an excursion into the dark side of Man's nature.

The only thing that drives me crazy about this movie is the cover box. Whoever thought up that misguided box should be fired, and I believe it is the reason nobody has seen this movie. We are led to believe this is a straight comedy with no meaning or plot. Just a screwed-over assistant on the war path.

But so what, so was Pulp Fiction, neither belong in the comedy section of your video store, though. Kevin Spacey is a genius, and this is yet another stand-out role in what is becoming one of the greatest string of performances any actor has ever accomplished. He is so over the top here, you can't help but laugh.

Especially when he gets into the elevator, and a feeble assistant tries to make it in before the doors close OUT, OUT, WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?!?!?! It is too funny, and scenes like that just keep coming.But to call this movie a comedy does not do it enough justice. It works on many different levels, exploring how far we can be pushed before we are sent over the edge, how far someone with power can take it before he goes too far, etc. While not usually much of a sentimentalist, I thought the scene where Spacey breaks down while discussing the murder of his wife was touching and insightful. I liked that it showed that even the most heartless b*****d has his own story to tell, and it makes for a more two-dimensional character. Basically, this movie is great in every way, and I can't say enough about Frank Whaley's performance. He is sort of overshadowed by Spacey's character, but that's the point. He plays the cowering lap-dog perfectly, and to see how the abuse pushes him into a completely different character is fascinating.

One of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  Spacey's dry delivery style is so perfectly matched with this character.  Buddy is able to belittle Guy in any number of ways, but perhaps most effective is when he simply looks at him, doesn't raise his voice and speaks the words You...have...no...brain.  No judgement calls are necessary.  What you think means nothing.  What you feel means nothing.When the movie dips into the romantic subplot between Guy and another producer named Dawn the movie becomes less interesting, but Spacey's performance makes this movie worth watching over and over.

Swimming With Sharks is not a film on par with either of those two films, but in my opinion, this is Kevin Spacey's most dynamic and utterly believable performance.  It is worth renting 8 times over to watch Spacey's do his foul mouth, smarmy, sarcastic, ultra-egomaniac act better than he has ever done before and better than he has done since.Spacey plays Buddy Ackerman, a powerful Hollywood studio executive with a menacing reputation as the Boss From Hell.  Frank Whaley plays Guy, a film school graduate that becomes Buddy's assistant as a way to gain eventual clout and power in the business, like Buddy's other past assistants.  He quickly learns that Buddy really is the `Boss From Hell' like his former assistant warned him and the movie is about him going off the deep end as a result.Spacey's performance is not only ruthless and menacing, it is bitterly hilarious and downright amazing.  Think of every single cutting putdown and insult that has been directed at you by someone else in your entire lifetime and odds are, Spacey's Buddy Ackerman character can top all of them all in about three sentences combined.  He says things to Guy like My bathmat means more to me than you.  His code of ethics to any of his assistants is You Are Nothing.  Your Opinions Are Nothing.  You Are Here For Me.  I Call The Shots.  You Listen.  This is the kind of boss that you'd fall out of your chair laughing your ass off watching him yell at all of his employee's, but that you'd feel like a worthless piece of trash if you ever had to work for him.The movie itself does have its flaws.  I am not convinced by the love story subplot between Guy and the woman producer.  And compared to Spacey, Whaley looks like a fish out of water in the portrayal of his character.  But the true message of the film lies within the scenes between Spacey and Whaley in Buddy's home.  Buddy might be the boss from hell, but he earned that right.  He fetched coffee and licked boots as an assistant once, too, and he didn't complain because that's life.  The ending (which trust me, you won't see coming) contrives the message a little, but it follows the general theme of the movie (be it to the complete and utter extreme) Show Business is ruthless and you don't get from point A to point B just being nice.Swimming With Sharks is not an easy movie to find at the video store.  This is one you have to look for.  It is a comedy (be it a `Black' comedy) and you will find it in that section.  I have no idea why critics were not as warm to this film as Spacey's other films.  I gather it is because he was not a notable Hollywood leading man then.  Had a film like this come out in the year 2000 in the aftermath of Spacey's American Beauty performance, they'd be hailing it as one of the best films of the year and would be naming Spacey an Oscar favorite.

Right from the very first second Guy is out of his depth &#150; status means more here than high-minded ideas.But although we're meant to feel sorry for Guy (he's constantly mocked and abused by Buddy), it's hard to feel for him when he's played by Frank Whaley, an actor so bland, so limp, so devoid of charisma or screen presence that he sucks all the colour out of the screen and turns his part of the frame a battleship grey.But what's even more ridiculous is that as well as playing the downtrodden assistant, he has to play the wronged employee who gets revenge on his boss by tying him to a chair and torturing him. I guess I can buy the fumbling loser, even though it's not fun to watch, but it's painful watching Whaley try and play a crazed lunatic. He's just a bunch of adolescent facial ticks with a bad floppy haircut. I can no more buy him torturing someone than I can buy Tom Cruise being declared clinically sane.And Guy isn't made any more believable or sympathetic when he starts humping the female producer who abused him at the beginning of the film. Their relationship is just so sappy and juvenile. You'd think they were in High School. But what makes it truly absurd is that the producer is attractive and powerful. Which begs the question why would a lowly toad-faced PA fill her with lust? Perhaps she has brain damage.Thankfully there's one smart person in the film Buddy. I'm sure you're supposed to get a certain guilty amusement out of his antics, while generally disapproving of his behaviour, but I have to say, as vile a person as he is, I'm on his side all the way through the film. He's ruthless, he's funny and he's got balls (Guy may as well be a eunuch). Plus he doesn't fold under Guy's torture. He even laughs in Guy's face when he threatens him with a gun. You've got to respect a man like that.But Buddy, for me, is made even more likable by the fact that Guy behaves totally unreasonably. I mean, yeah Buddy shouts at Guy, throws things at him and has slept with his girlfriend, but if you don't like your job, either urinate in your boss's coffee or quit. You don't have to behave like a child. Or as Buddy says, Your job is unfair to you? Grow up. Way it goes. And Guy is made even more annoying because the torture is over a woman. Come on, so your girl's done the bone dance with another man; that's life.But as absurd as the whole torture angle is, I guess it sort of works as a commentary on movies &#150; it's exactly the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a film (Guy even calls it payback time), so it's apt that filmmakers would go to such absurd lengths to vent their fury. But as I've already said, it fails because Whaley is such a poor actor (Spacey, by contrast, is excellent).However, worse than the torture sequences is the ending. Again it's meant to be an ironic comment on the movies &#150; you have to kill to get the top; you have to sell your soul &#150; but it's just silly. After torturing Buddy and finding out that his girlfriend slept her way to the top, Buddy and Guy decide to engage in a conspiracy &#150; they make out that Guy's girlfriend did the torturing and then Guy shoots his ex to 'save' Buddy from her. And then at the end, Guy becomes a top executive and he and Buddy are united &#150; they close the office door on the world like the final scene in The Godfather. Maybe if the film were a more outrageous black comedy, I could accept this ending. But seeing as it's played completely straight (except for Spacey), it's just ridiculous. Again, I just can't believe that such a limp individual would do something so outrageous. And the film never hints that Guy is terribly ambitious. He even finds it hard to verbalise why he's attracted to the movie business &#150; he eventually says it's because of 'memories'. But really, even if you were obsessed with movies and desperately wanted to make it to the top, would you spare the man you loath and kill the woman you love? I doubt it myself. But the film's desperate to have a 'dark' ending where the bad guy wins, so it contrives to bring it about, even at the expense of logic.

This movie tried way too hard. It was exaggeratedly heavy on the comedy and exaggeratedly heavy on the drama. It didn't seem to know which way to go. And the two never managed to mesh well. In the end, its message, though clear, was not effectively communicated. It came off preachy and last minute. Spacey was fantastic as Buddy, but the breakdown scene involving his wife was just tossed in and played up to the point of being ridiculous. The entire torture scenario seemed silly to me, especially that paper cut business. I couldn't take Guy seriously at all. In addition, Guy's relationship with the girlfriend was completely unbelievable and acted more as a filler than anything else. That would have been ok if the relationship hadn't had such an important role in the ending. And the ending itself was too much to be taken seriously. Everything was so extreme. We were practically slapped in the face with the moral and it wasn't appreciated, by me anyway. In addition, there was too much talk. So much was said instead of shown, which made the movie drag. Whaley bored me and I wasn't sympathetic to him at any point in the movie. Oh... And character development? Not any that I saw. Whaley's transformation is best classified as here today, gone tomorrow. He doesn't visibly transform. The ending is unexpected but also unjustified by the story. Sure, that makes it interesting, but that's not good storytelling. And the tone... the director's pretension is so tangible it almost made me sick. I've rarely seen a movie that took itself so seriously.As a huge Kevin Spacey fan I am appalled when I read reviews that rank this movie as one of his best, or as his best performance.

In Glengarry Glen Ross, he delivered cold lines of fury when talking to his deadbeat employees and took some severe blows to the ego when he was jabbed with personal insults. In American Beauty, it was entrancing to hear him narrate his story with such gratitude and depth, along with giving us one of the best performances of the decade. And in K-PAX, he convincingly played an alleged extraterrestrial who seemed to appear out of thin air and turn a skeptical psychiatrist into a true believer. The man is a treasure often shorthanded and under-valued.Spacey gives yet another fantastic performance of true power and control in Swimming With Sharks, a black comedy that is heavy on the laughs and insight, and easy on the levels of conformity and monotony. This is a biting drama of business and progress in the work world, with some of the toughest and most brutal insight into the corporate world that can only be compared to the level of truths brought in Kevin Smith's Clerks and Mike Judge's Office Space. This deserves a spot in the same league.Guy (Frank Whaley) is a young writer who is extremely satisfied to get a job working as the assistant for movie mogul Buddy Ackerman, played by Kevin Spacey. Guy expects the job to be beneficial and insightful, until he sees Buddy's true side, which is loud, obnoxious, pretentious, smothering, overbearing, and just plain unforgiving behavior as he takes pride in being belligerent and disrespectful to his assistants. In an extremely well written scene involving Guy trying to reason with Buddy about his yelling and his uncontrollable tirades, Buddy browbeats him relentlessly by telling him, my bathmat means more to me than you, at the same time throwing pencils at him saying, these pencils more important, these pens more important. The key to this scene is that both men have extremely valid points; Guy is trying to speak on a human-level with Buddy and brings up the idea of how in a business relationship, one must have the skill and ability to hold a grown-up discussion with one another. On the other hand, Buddy remarks on how you need to be a man to do the job and you must accept the torment as a means to get somewhere in the world. Further commentary is provided when we open up and see Buddy as more than a cynic, but how he got to be one and whether or not guy is on the same track heading to the same inevitable destination.The film is intercut with scenes showing Guy breaking in to Buddy's home, taking him hostage by tying him to his chair, and preceding to torture him mercilessly, reminding him of all the times he was demanding and ruthless to him. Again, the scene is not supposed to inspire moments of shock and jolts as it is to prove to the audience that both these men have perfectly valid points. Are Guy's actions justifiable? Yes, but they're not particularly right. Are Buddy's reasons for being mean and ruthless to his assistants justified? Yes, but they're not particularly right either.Writer/director George Huang wrote the film based off of what he experienced as an executive assistant at Columbia Pictures. Whether or not the acts he was involved in were this extreme or are fabricated to fit film's high standard I can not say, but Huang clearly knows what aspiring young cinephiles (or just business man on the lowest step of the corporate ladder) must go through and put up with in order to make it big. Where Huang scores effortlessly is in the writing, which is sharp, brutal, and all around satisfying. Seeing these men spit out some of the foulest things imaginable is unbelievably satisfying and is not only played for laughs but for intelligence.While the moments of darkness and subversive violence that are spliced in with the moments of typical office conundrums and tribulations may be a bit abrupt, they are nonetheless faithful and necessary to the film's point. I've always seen film as a device used to depict either morals, ideas, ideologies, places usually left unexplored, utopias, etc, but I've too seen it has a brilliant way to showcase events, lifestyles, and modern quirks. Swimming With Sharks is a brutally well written piece brilliantly taking us into the life of an overworked and under-appreciated businessman who is just looking for respect and fair treatment.Starring Kevin Spacey and Frank Whaley.

As the film goes on we hear from Buddy, Guy's viscous boss who lives to torment him, doing just that to him on the phone, but today is no ordinary day, today Guy isn't taking the insults lying down, today Guy, is fighting back.Over the course of the next 90 minutes we experience the previous year of Guy's life of torment under Buddy Ackerman as his take-it-with-a-smile, put-upon assistant while interspersed with his latest pursuit which is that of torturing his boss with a variety of petty annoying vindictive torments.This is largely a film that revolves around three characters, Buddy, Guy and Guy's girlfriend, and as the film builds towards its inevitable conclusion we are held captive by three performers doing quite an incredible job, Frank Whalley and Michelle Forbes are great as Guy and his girlfriend and aspiring writer Dawn Lockard. But the real star is without doubt Kevin Spacey, who takes all the plaudits for Guy's good ideas and yet thinks nothing of putting him down at a moments notice, getting him to approach any blonde haired bimbo for a Chat in his office and then ditching them when Buddy is done with them, Spacey is magnificent in this role, and yet by the end of the film, we sympathise with him, but still don't like him.This is a hidden gem and one that should not be missed when on television.

Hopefully you can apply some of your own experiences to understand Guy's early actions before the film explains it.

It follows Guy (Frank Whaley) who is a clean-shaven enthusiastic new recruit into this unique world landing himself a job as the personal assistant to Buddy Ackerman (Kevin Spacey) an expletive throwing repugnant studio executive whose addition to your CV opens every door imaginable but is counteracted so much by his demeanour that many would find it not worth the trouble.Guy seems to have the determination to see it through helped by script writer and love interest Dawn (Michelle Forbes) but after working for the man for over a year, cracks begin to surface and Guy is finally pushed too far showing up at Buddy's home in the middle of the night intent on revenge. What plays out over the 100 minutes is a mixture between the past year of his life and the present unfolding situation.This was George Huang's first (and it would seem only notable) foray into the world of writing and directing and credit must be given to him. The script is impressive with Whaley engrossing himself into the character topped only by Spacey's exceptional performance where he looks set to star in a similar, albeit toned down, role in Horrible Bosses. He not only excels in many of his 'throwing a tantrum' scenes but somehow brings sympathy and compassion to a character that we should not feel anything for. Even when being held hostage he emits a certain smug arrogance that would be misplaced in any other character apart from this one.I felt conflicted given the knowledge at the beginning that Guy kidnaps his boss. It somewhat limits the sympathy you can show towards him regardless of finding out what Buddy did to drive him to such lengths.I wouldn't class this as a comedy per say as this is not going to have you laughing a great deal but rather an extremely dark satire of life in Hollywood and the means required to keep your head above the water. It shows us that the calling of the bright lights can change a man with only a few have what is required to make it. Add all of this together to an unexpected ending and it makes for an interesting watch.Yes there are moments where I felt things were not quite working and the relationship between Dawn and Guy lacked that believability factor but Swimming With Sharks certainly made the time fly and has enough to keep it fresh in the mind for a couple of days at the very least.For further reviews feel free to check out http//www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com "},{"Title":"Good, but maybe not as good as you've heard.","Date":"31 May 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" This is possibly one of those films that somehow ends up being better than the sum of its faults.

I've seen this movie 10 times at least, and every time I see it, you catch on to different key moments and lines. Kevin's character is that of Buddy Ackerman, who is a fictitious producer extraordinaire who's life has been hell up until the point when he received that job. He takes it out on everyone, especially his personal assistants. When Rex (Benicio Del Toro) gets promoted as the VP of Paramount Studios, Guy takes his place as the new head on the chopping block for Buddy to abuse.Guy, modestly played by Frank Whaley, is a typical Hollywood newbie to the behind-the-scenes jobs. He's a writer who wants to try his hardest by working hard, but he lacks the detail that Ackerman is looking for. And Buddy lets him know it. Throughout the film, Guy is picking up on how the game is played while trying to maintain a relationship with a smaller producer, Dawn (Michelle Forbes). When Dawn is caught to be cheating on Guy with his boss, all s&^+ hits the fan.This film had absolutely mesmerizing acting. Truly a one-of-a-kind film, this movie should be in every DVD collection. Not only will you look like a real buff, you'll want to be one after a single viewing. It was a good introduction to Frank Whaley, for myself, and his talents. The music was very moody and near perfect for that drama, but not quite drama feel in every scene. The directing was simple, but the story behind the movie is great. Check out the trivia on this movie to learn more about where it came from. Kevin was even a co-producer to get this film out there. It was a great part for him, by the way; it really touched on his usually-cast mean, poignant guy role.So run out and BUY (don't bother renting, you'll want to see it again later anyways) this DVD.

His aim is to mold Guy in a particular way--a way that works even though Guy thinks that he's severely breaking form in the extended penultimate scene that's intercut with Guy and Ackerman's history.Huang shows professional relationships as consisting mostly of politicking and manipulation. That's true at every level--certainly even Guy is doing this. There is very little authenticity to anyone in their working relationships. That seems pretty accurate to me, unfortunately. It's notable that the one dream of authenticity in the film--Guy talking about moving to Wyoming with Dawn (Michelle Forbes)--is treated and dispensed with as an unreachable fantasy, and it's also notable (and is fairly literally pointed out in the film) that Dawn, the one character who tries to demand being more authentic amidst the shark infested waters of the professional world, basically never gets anywhere.In the highly metaphorical ending of the film, things remain manipulative, political and backstabbing, and in that climate, at least two out of three characters win. Huang seems to be suggesting that the professional world ain't likely to change any time soon, and that even if you try to change it or manipulate the game itself, you're likely to just get eaten up by it, processed by it and incorporated into it anyway.

Kevin Spacey is just the sort of actor that always seems to do that.Swimming with Sharks, is the story of a young man, Guy ( Frank Whaley), who is determined to make his mark in the Movie industry. He lands a job as the assistant to big time Hollywood executive, Buddy Ackerman (Kevin Spacey), and thinks he has the start to launch him into the big time. It turns out that Buddy is not only a bigshot executive but also makes ridiculous demands, and is a downright cruel demanding boss, that seems to have no regard for his assistant or anyone for that matter. How far can Buddy push Guy until he snaps?This is not a new story line, it has been done time after time, but it is a horrible boss story, so everyone can relate to it. I am not a fan of Frank Whaley and actually can't stand him, but he does a decent job in this one. As I said this movie wasn't very original and I probably wouldn't have liked this movie at all if it wasn't for Kevin Spacey.Kevin Spacey did a great job portraying the evil, demanding boss.In my mind, he was what made this movie. Everything in this movie says boring and done before, but Kevin Spacey's performance turns it into a good movie. It's rare that one actor could do that by himself but in this case it is true.Not to reveal anything, but the end takes a twist that is actually a pretty good one. So overall, it was a good movie, not a great one. Spacey turns out to be the only one driving it, but somehow it was enough to make it watchable and at times enjoyable.Like my reviews, hate em?

The movie industry, according to Swimming with Sharks, implies that it will promote the latter. The consistently underrated Frank Whaley plays Guy, a naive film school grad who believes he's gotten a position which will lead to the job of his dreams. An Oscar worthy Kevin Spacey is his boss, Buddy Ackerman, a powerful Hollywood producer with no limit on his passive-aggressive sadism. Throughout the course of the movie we witness the rigors that Buddy makes Guy do, often with a dismissive insult.Why should you watch this? 1) The script is by director Geroge Huang and is reportedly based on his own experiences as a page boy for industry elites, thereby providing a potential insider look at what it's like to be in such an environment. 2) The audience's sympathy to Buddy and Guy is skillfully manipulated over the course of the film, creating emotionally involved viewing.Add to this a powerful piano theme and you have a picture asking us how far we would go for success.

Yet, I am amazed as to how one can make such a masterpiece considering it has the most of the trite of plots. The reason to this is also simple a bit of outr√© &#145;creativity' by the movie-director, and of course, Mr. Kevin Spacey.The movie wouldn't be half as good without Spacey, who is the life of the movie. Though he plays the part of the villain, he is more adorable than anyone else in the movie. The whole of the 90 min. of the movie is full of Spacey, and his mordant dialogues. Though one is supposed to feel sorry for Frank Whaley, for the inclement treatment he receives from Spacey, one doesn't. On the contrary, one rather wants that Spacey continue this treatment, so that he (Spacey) could continue treating the viewer with his fantabulous dialogue-delivery of some of the most acerbic dialogues ever written. It is amazing that one actually ends up laughing throughout the major part of this otherwise subfusc movie, thanks to Spacey. Though Spacey has got a lot to do with making this movie, a treat to watch, the exceptional direction is also worth a mention. Though George Huang had nothing much to play with, as far as this movie is concerned, which mainly consists of exchange of dialogues, and very little of anything else, with some &#145;intelligent' creativity from him, he has managed to make this a very interestingly directed movie. The interesting direction comes from the really weird arrangement of the movie, especially the non-chronological ordering of the scenes.  The climax of the movie is unpredictable, and one of the best ever. The whole course of the movie changes drastically in the last five minutes. As a matter of fact, though the movie puts on a funny fa√ßade throughout, one actually feels quite sad after the movie ends, feeling sorry for Michelle Forbes, especially. This is where beauty lies in the movie though it makes you laugh throughout, you actually feel &#145;punched in the face', at the end.

A wonderfully painful microcosm of human interaction, it manages to use powerful direction, succesful flashbacks, and superb acting to both entertain and shock.The three primary actors are Guy (tormented underling), Buddy (tormenting boss), and Dawn, who's had relationships with both. Guy is initially an idealistic, ambitious screenwriter, unintimidated by the Hollywood social infrastructure. Buddy (Kevin Spacey, terrific as the only name actor) is the gleefully malicious boss who can guarantee success, but only if tolerated from long enough.Buddy manipulates, exploits, and abuses (emphasis on the last word) Guy, who tolerates his boss's behavior until he realizes his one confidant, Dawn, has been in relationships with Buddy before. Guy, after being bended A LOT, finally snaps, and the easy exploitation avenue this movie could have taken is gracefully avoided, as the relationship between the three, and especially Buddy and Guy , is carefully examined.This movie is somewhere between slice-of-life, coming-of-age, character-interaction, and drama, and manages to draw in the best elements of each.

Everyone wakes up in the morning believing he/she is the star of the movie, and that anyone who interferes with one's own personal agenda is in some way the enemy. Revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self-esteem. Rather than fighting back in the moment, the hero draws upon built-up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore equilibrium. Quite naturally, in the real world this type of revenge seldom relieves the tension because life is not a movie; after the revenge is enacted the actions taken have their own consequences. A good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill. In the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolved.Swimming With Sharks is advertised as a comedy, no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this oddity. It's dark, but it isn't dark comedy (Company Of Men and the works of Todd Solondz come much closer). Parts of the film are so brutal they pre-date the current torture-porn genre everyone is so obsessed with (Saw, Hostel). There are some laughs. There are laughs in Saving Private Ryan too, but it isn't labeled comedy.The intrinsic problem with this film is that it hasn't earned its revenge case. It is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to pay him back for all the mistreatment. The hero (aptly named Guy) is an everyman so vague we know literally nothing about him...what does he do with his spare time? Does he have friends/family? How did he get where he is? What are his interests (this becomes a running motif through the film, no doubt inspired by the film's author's own struggle...What do you want?, the answer to which we are denied by a vague, cheat of an ending)? It's very difficult to care for such a character, even if acted well (even Tom Hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll, such as Punchline). Kevin Spacey as the boss, Buddy, is supposed to be a monster but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laughs came when he abused his assistant--he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is being tortured, the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality. At this point any message the author had has been lost; there's no hero in this film, ergo, no reason to care at all.It's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business. I worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it's not that far-fetched. I had similar wish-fulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that I was justified. I thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story (actually, the ONLY woman--there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film) just by being your eager, naive self, that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most monsters are really just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self. As the film points out, if Guy was so unhappy he only had to leave. The film doesn't offer any denouement at all, surprise ending notwithstanding. We still know nothing about the protagonists, we can't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too. In short, there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that (shock!) the film business can be pretty brutal.There are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge-style fantasies, both the feel-good variety (9-to5, Working Girl, The Devil Wears Prada) and not so much (War Of The Roses, the remake of The Hills Have Eyes). This isn't one of them--despite a fun turn by Benicio Del Toro in the Emily Blunt role from Prada and some interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, mean, confused and slightly dull creation of self- indulgence from a director who has, one hopes, worked it all out by now...

Hollywood producer exec, Buddy Ackerman (Spacey) who just revels in the role with flawless brilliance, lets out a string of verbal and physical assaults on a new fish employee, who Buddy has basically kissing his arse. Of course a lot of employees in the real world, who have been bullied, where the boss has made them their ashtray, will identify with this all too well, or painfully so, or to smaller degrees, than Spacey's handling of his employee, Guy, Pulp Fiction's Frank Whaley, suited up, and suited perfectly in this role, worlds away from that psychopathic nutter, in the first Vacancy film. The movie switches back and forth in slick fashion, which doesn't make it lose it intensity at all. Whaley has turned the tables on Spacey, making him his b.tch, holding him hostage in his own palisade house. What sparked this was Guy's new love involvement (Michelle Forbes) who Spacey refers loosely and dismissively to as a little f..k towel. We continue to cut back and forth to Buddy's mistreatment of Guy, chronologically, until that final straw, and oh, how does he make Whaley suffer. In the end, unfortunately the victim is either of these two, and in that kind of hazy finale, we're left to figure out how it really went down, providing a slick thriller element, you wrack your brain for hours with, and this make does make pensive. I really enjoyed this movie, like I hadn't another one this much, for a while, which Adelaide Cinema's weren't granted a season run. But I recommend this to anyone, as it's another one that's slipped through the cracks, and that goes double if you're a Spacey fan, for you are to witness one of the most dramatically intense, searing, and powerhouse performances from a boss whose methods of intimidation are frightening.

Perhaps it was his passion project?It's the classic story of a young man taking a job as an assistant to a big Hollywood agent, in order to get ahead in life. One thing it really hammers home is that a year can be way longer than first it seems.You gotta love a young Benicio Del Toro performance, with that dour accent of an unknown nationality, like Fez in The Usual Suspects. Benny of the Bull plays a quietly excellent character as Rex, or the man who Guy, played by Frank Whaley, will replace answering calls at the desk.Speaking of Whaley, here's one of two shortcomings.His performance is ultimately the least impressive part of this movie. And as the protagonist, that's not the greatest sign.I'm not saying Whaley's acting is bad, but it's unconvincing. He can't keep pace with the whirlwind plot, and the coolness of Spacey.The scenery, settings and backdrops often leave much to be desired. They're not incomplete or shabby; the surroundings of the characters are just very bland.Perhaps this is a stylistic choice that somehow adds to the movie. Personally I think the budget wasn't very high (IMDb estimates it around $700,000) and this doesn't allow for tons of prep previous to shooting.At the same time, the movie doesn't need elaborate backdrops or an overwhelming amount of sensory detail. There's enough already packed in.More on that later.On a final note regarding casting, Michelle Forbes as Dawn Lockard is just spectacular. Her character is compelling, strong and nuanced. The scenes in which she interacts with Guy are gripping and covered in subtlety.Forbes played roles in lesser-known features, such as Escape from L.A. and Kalifornia. Recently she's much more prominent in television and her work includes a significant role as Maryann Forrester Maryann in the second season of HBO's True Blood. So noteworthy is her performance it's deserving of a sidebar. Skip the following bracketed paragraph if you couldn't care less.(Sidebar True Blood is no longer a good television show. It may never have been 'great' as an overall televised product, but the first two seasons had fabulous story arcs. It went off the rails because of the ever-expanding world building, and the perseverance of a character named Terra. The entire second season is carried by the introduction of the new antagonist, Maryann Forrester Maryann, and a large hunk of the show's success is due to the thoroughly riveting and convincing performance from Michelle Forbes.)Here's a smart exchange.When they first have a drink and discuss business, Dawn asks Guy if he'd like to go out. He orders a glass of white wine and she orders a cocktail. While they talk, she chews on the ice from her drink and smokes.Huang draws a dichotomy here between the typical male and female roles in social and romantic interactions. I think Guy's shorter than Dawn too, so they're really an odd pair.Nuanced scenes like this resonate throughout the entire film.When Buddy and Guy are conversing, pay close attention to the physical positioning of Spacey's body. At one point, his shoes are propped on the desk and uncrossed, displaying his crotch like a woman giving birth. This posture illustrates the relative difference in power between the two men and Buddy's attitude toward his assistant.So if you haven't seen Swimming with Sharks, now's the time, before the scenery and settings begin to feel any older. Stop reading here if you're sensitive to spoilers.Anyway, a final few things are worthy of discussion.First of all, the wind-up toys on Buddy's desk, and the discussion of 'Equal' versus 'Sweet-N- Low' artificial sweeteners. The symbolism in these details are too numerous to note; some of which I can't wrap my head around either. Aside from the lack of 'artificial sweetener' present in Buddy's rhetoric, I'm assuming there's value to the color of the packets (blue and pink, reminiscent of early-life gender roles) but can't complete the analytic connection without further research.In retrospect, the existence of the toys throughout the earlier portion of the movie seems off. As the narrative unfolds, the mechanisms don't draw our attention, but it's odd to think a man with such a business-oriented lifestyle would adorn his workspace with playthings.The resolution is built around a technological quirk of a distinct age in history. Only in the '90s could a conflict revolve around the oddities of call waiting and conferencing. But hey, it works.The ending is a bit confounding in its value. It's an original twist and the correct way to wrap up the story. But quite a bit gets lost in, what seems like, a rushed conclusion.It's not hurried; it's just a drastic and almost unprecedented turn for the story to take. The viewer is never convinced Guy's passion for the business outweighs his love of Dawn.And I hate to harp on this, but it goes back to Whaley's acting ability. When he shows up at Buddy's house and threatens him at gunpoint, the seriousness of his intent doesn't feel real. Further, the torture scenes aren't genuine because we don't see the capability for this level of aggression in Guy's behavior.All things considered, Swimming with Sharks is a classic that shouldn't be forgotten!

"},{"Title":"Poor production, unconvincing Hollywood milieu not supported by barbed, illogical script...","Date":"28 October 2009","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Ill-tempered, verbally abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant ragged with nit-picking requests, keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; after a year of office-terror, the working stiff finally cracks. Writer-director George Huang has possibly bit off more than he can chew here. His Swimming With Sharks isn't a diatribe against Hollywood, nor is it a tribute to the hard-working underling...instead, it's stunt film-making with a twist, a one-trick pony with tunnel-vision. The surroundings don't look or feel like Tinsel Town (perhaps due to a limited budget), and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a movie-making entity (it could be a realtor's office in the Valley, for all we know). Lead Kevin Spacey, who also served as one of the film's producers, gives a controlled and focused performance as the power-mad mogul whose ego is out of control; he does good work, and yet the character doesn't ring true. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high-ranking status fail to jibe with what we do see; who does this man answer to? what drives him beyond humiliating others for sport? what projects is he juggling aside from the one script we see passed around? The film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated, it begins to seem like a stage-play padded out for the big screen--and yet one without enough characters or motivations in it. Perhaps Huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead his movie looks like a half-baked project which needed a lot more insight, humor, and atmosphere. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Swimming with a Bad Ending **Spoilers***","Date":"2 December 2000","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  This film is about one jerk with too much power who uses that power to abuse and blackmail people (including Whaley's girlfriend played by the beautiful Michelle Forbes).The best part I can say is that the characters are real, Spacey plays the worst boss in the world (in the real world he'd be fired) who works at a Film company. Like any dictator boss, he has people who run errands for him and well act like puppets for him. Whaley is the guy who pitches a great idea for a movie and Spacey steals it for his advantage along with trying to use Whaley's girlfriend. The rest of the film deals with Whaley abusing Spacey (god I loved those parts) by any means possible The ending though leaves you unsatisfied.If you havent seen the ending here it isWhaley must decide between shooting his boss (who has it coming at this point) or his girlfriend (who was being blackmailed into having sex with the evil boss). Now who do you think he is going to shoot? His boss? Wrong!!The movie doesn't even explain why Whaley shoots his girlfriend. Before this had happened Whaley was in control and if he had shot his boss in self defense ,everyone would believe because his boss was the worst person you could think of.It makes you think though maybe there was some sort of homophobic element the writers were thinking.But again it was directed by a no-name director.I cant imagine why Whaley who is a decent actor (The Doors, Born on the Fourth of July) did this, he must have needed the money.A very underrated actor.

This is the worst film I've seen in quite some time. I came to this board expecting to see the same response I had, but inexplicably, there are several people who love this film and Spacey's performance in particular.Some will chastise me for saying it, but I find Kevin Spacey's acting quite limited despite the world's admiration for him. I felt like I was watching a meaner version of Kevin's American Beauty role. His character in this film is ridiculously overacted, all the way down to his laughable insults he throws at his assistant.There are all-world trite and boring scenes like when Spacey is tearing into Whaley about bringing him Equal instead of Sweat and Low. Somehow, I suspected this particular scene was supposed to be funny, but by this time I was ready to hit the stop button (this is approximately 20 minutes into the film).What about the faux-homage to Resevoir Dogs? Whaley proclaims, I think I saw this in a movie once, as if he's going to cut off Spacey's ear. But what does he use to cut him? An envelope! That's right, he's going to give him paper cuts! That has to be one of Hollywood's all-time worst scenes, and the fact that the actors and director tried to carry it out with a straight face makes it even more appalling.I will admit that I didn't see the end of this film (my DVD mercifully locked up about a half hour before the end), but anyone who wishes to say so could spare me the line that I missed a great twist and everything would have made sense. Well, I don't care what happened in the end, because it could never make up for all that bad acting and relentlessly over-the-top dialogue. I even got the feeling that the actors themselves wanted to get out of this film as bad as I did.

I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as Big Brain on Brad in Pulp Fiction.  But I just didn't care about the characters at all.  Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him.  Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more. This was like watching a bad car wreck.  Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.  "}]
