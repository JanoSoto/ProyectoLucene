[{"Title":"Should have been better, but suffers from serious lack of originality and direction in key places","Date":"7 March 2010","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" 'A New Generation' is the third Amityville entry to base its plot around writer John G. Jones's premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. This time around, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. Soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood.This 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. Things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'It's About Time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. However, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. On the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*.There's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. Since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it's just tedious anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. There were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we?Which is a shame, because 'A New Generation' has a more-than-capable cast. I was going to hold off on watching this until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, I was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while I'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing Ibsen.The sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling Suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. Getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. Unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all.'A New Generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. However, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'The Possession', for whom the story won't be such a massive deja-vu trip.

I don't know, but I do miss the ominous house itself which featured prominently in the first three films. Sure it has connections and even the image of it appears in the haunted antique mirror which came from infamous Long Island house, but it's just not the same. The straight-to-video fare A New Generation is the seventh film, where the terror scraps suburbia for an urban apartment building filled with budding artists who one-by- one fall to the evil entity. An antique mirror is given to a photographer by a homeless man. Soon after accepting the gift, the man starts having haunting visions of a killing spree which might just have some relevance to him. But he's not the only one who's been affected by the demonic force within the mirror, but those living in his studio building begin to find themselves possessed/or infatuated by these dark forces. The plot tries to tie in a little more to the history of the Long House island, especially with the main character's (an affable Ross Partridge) connection to what's actually happening. So most of the time is spent with Partridge's character trying to uncover the truth and dealing with flashbacks. Didn't make it any more interesting though. Predictable and interchangeable. The imitating special effects do have its moments, but there's a real lack of atmosphere and thrills. Sure it's slickly directed, but feels vapid and flat. There's a good supporting cast featuring Terry O'Quinn, Richard Roundtree. Julia Nickson-Soul and a very twitchy David Naughton that do enliven things.Hardly terrible, but rather uninspired.

The rest of their friends, Dick, (David Naughton) and Janet Cutler, (Barbara Howard) think it's a useless purchase until a series of accidents plague them and their friends. As the strange occurrences begin to mount, Keyes begins to suspect that the mirror might be responsible. Doing a little digging into it's past, he discovers a startling secret that puts him and his loved ones in grave danger.The Good News There's a couple of pretty decent things about this one. First of all, the different gags done with the mirror itself are pretty good. The way that it is able to show a special image and is able to trick the participant in the mirror to kill themselves to look exactly that way is a nice trick to see. The kills are pretty cleverly done and do manage to get some shock out of them. The opening kill with the glass looks creepy, and is the best overall kill. The loft killing is the most suspenseful, as the fallen portraits, creepy in their own right, are brought in with a maze that is brought in to play is a nice addition. The final half hour is it's best part, with some nice action scenes and a little bit of suspense thrown in as well. There's the main reason for watching the film, and it makes it seem a little better than when it really wasn't.The Bad News There's still a couple of major things wrong with this one. The fact that there's hardly any action at all in the film is a big factor. The only thing that happens is the kills, which are pretty much it. The rest is useless running around without much of anything done, and it's hardly anything interesting that happens during that time. It just makes for a boring experience. The second is that it really has nothing at all to do with the story of the first film and has no real connection at all. That only a small number of references are made and that nothing even takes place in the fabled house makes it weird how the connection is made. These are the main problems, as the major bore-ness hammers it home more than anything.The Final Verdict Really only guilty of being a rather boring film with no real action at all, and it does have enough other moments to really give fans of the series a couple of rather interesting scenes. Take a shot on it, there's worse films out there than this one.Rated R Graphic Language, Violence and Brief Nudity "},{"Title":"Kinda' stole the Friday the 13th TV series plot line...","Date":"15 March 2005","Score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Okay, maybe I'm a little bit too harsh on this movie, since I worked on it and got stiffed on the Credits for SFX...

However as soon as Keyes installs it in his loft, the evil that resides behind the glass frame wastes no time in spreading it's evil in it's new habitation, terrible things start happening, mysterious deaths occur amongst his friends after they peer into the mirror, where they see images of harming themselves shortly before their deaths, influencing them to make away with themselves & Keyes night time sleep is haunted by a re-occurring nightmare, wherein someone is walking through the halls of the infamous long island home, blowing away a family. Keyes then learns a couple days later that the homeless man has died with Keyes name & address in his pocket which interests a police detective investigating the deaths occurring in the same apartment complex Keyes lives in. Soon Keyes comes to realize that he has a far more serious connection to the mysterious homeless man than he ever dared imagine & soon deep dark memories from his past bubble up. Under the suggestion by his girlfriend, Keyes & his friends hold an art show where the main attraction will be a re-enactment of the dinner scene murder from his dream, that Keyes hopes will end the nightmare, however while Keyes attempts to stage a mock-up of the incident, the evil spirit dwelling behind the glass frame of the mirror has other ideas & that's to do a very real re-enactment of the event using Keyes friends as a very real set of victims.AMITYVILLE A NEW GENERATION is the seventh film in this long running series that takes the same route as both parts 4 & 6 by having a cursed object taken from the infamous house of horror to be the one causing all the demonic mayhem (not surprising since the same people who made those two films made this one as well) the film is well acted & director John Murlowski does fairly well behind the camera & the story for the most part is probably one of the most better written & should have been one of the most compelling entries to ever grace the series. While the film does have a certain sense of weirdness to it & some pretty good (if brief) special effects & a pretty suspenseful climax it sadly never reaches the full potential that it should.While I admire the film-makers taking a different route & trying to do something new with the series, the sad fact is AMITYVILLE A NEW GENERATION comes off as alternatively dull & plodding most of the time. The script by AMITYVILLE 1992 writers Christopher Defarria (who also produces) & Antonio Toro while indeed serves up some creepy images, for the most part is unconvincing, simply because a lot of the film is filler. There's an interesting flashback sequence that ties Keyes connection to the homeless man that is fairly interesting, but apart from that the film fails to do anything new or interesting & merely just retreads the same old ground of it's predecessors, only with less styles. The image of the infamous home is seen in the frame of the mirror every time a murder occurs, which doesn't make a lick of sense, since it should be the demon that inhabited the house itself that should be showing up not the home, since the home is only the house it dwelt in, in truth that seems to have only been inserted in order to pass this off as a sequel since there's very little-if anything (minus the title & house image) that ties this film anywhere to the previous instalments. Take out the house & you would still have a movie, there's no connections to the previous events or the house itself, we've also come to learn that Sonny Montelli from AMITYVILLE II THE POSSESSION (or Ronny DeFeo, which ever AMITYVILLE version you choose to go with) wasn't the only person to blow away his family in the house, as twenty six years prior Richard Bronner (the homeless man & who is eventually revealed to be Keye's long lost father) also blew his family away (what's with this house getting people to blow away their families with loaded shot guns anyways)? Things get even more complicated (said disappointing) when we learn that it isn't the evil of the infamous house after all, but rather Keyes father who is orchestrating the supernatural going on's & trying to get is son to repeat the crime.The film does feature some familiar names both in front & behind the camera, with the exception of producers Barry Bernardi & Steve White who again return as producers, there's also, composer Daniel Licht (Hellraiser 3 Hell On Earth) Richard Roundtree (Shaft) Terry O' Quinn (Lost & Stepfather 1 & 2) Barbra Howard (Friday The 13th The Final Chapter) David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London) Lin Shaye (A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 & 7) Robert Rustler (A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 Freddy's Revenge) & author John G. Jones (who's book AMITYVILLE THE EVIL ESCAPES) also serves as a co-producer. Speaking of Jones, it's his book which was made into a movie (AMITYVILLE HORROR PART 4 THE EVIL ESCAPES) that served as the basis for this movie.All in all, AMITYVILLE A NEW GENERATION isn't a total loss, but could so easily have been the series creepiest entry if handled properly, as it is, it remains a watchable entry that is strictly for those who saw & loved at least some of the earlier instalments.The ending leaves an opening for yet another sequel AMITYVILLE DOLLHOUSE **1/2 stars "},{"Title":"Almost as bad The Amityville Curse","Date":"20 September 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Horror","Review":" A man is talking to a bum, who end up, giving him this mirror, this time is the mirror, that has the evil force in it.then he gives the mirror too their next door neighbour, soon anyone who look into the mirror will die.It was good idea, they could have done so much more, and better.This is a stand alone movie,so it not connected to any of the other in series, saying that this is third stand alone movie in the series The acting in this movie was not that bad, the movie it self was way to predicable, can be really, really boring at time,i wish there was a lot more gore then there was, I did enjoy, one or two so what gory scene, which were really well shot.This is one the weakest of them of all, it not the worse one in the series.The Amityville Curse is still the worse of the series, this movie in the second worse but still watchable, unlike The Amityville Curse.I going to give this movie 3 out of 10 "}{"Title":"Another strong chapter in the series","Date":"7 July 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" After 'Amityville 1992 It's About Time' breathed some much needed life into this dying franchise it was no surprise that another sequel was on the way.

Not really very scary. Some cheap and unscary looking monster make-up.Final thoughts Sure none of these sequels to the original will be remembered for being great, but you could find ones that are far more unwatchable and that make you feel bad for those involved.

In this sense Amityville A New Generation is a more thoughtful film that its predecessors, and a bit of a slow burner.It certainly won't win any awards but it does try something different- time is taken to introduce us to characters, in this case a group of struggling artists very much in the 90210/ Melrose Place mould of attractive, living in amazing apartments but supposedly broke and angst ridden. It's endearing in its own way- right down to the fashion. The occasional self importance regarding the artwork can lead to some unintentional humour, all of which adds to the odd charm of this film.It is nice to see appearances from an older David Naughton (the male lead David Kessler in An American Werewolf in London) and a younger Terry O'Quinn (who plays the enigmatic Locke on the television drama Lost) Overall though the film is unlikely to set anyone's world alight it does draw you in, and you will find yourself caring for the lead. However as I've said before, expect a different pace and style from the earlier Amityville horror films. Like 1992 its focus is as much on characters changing as supernatural happenings. So be aware of what to expect if you're thinking of picking this one up.

In the direct-to-video affair, an up-and-coming photographer (Ross Partridge, whose credentials include (1) episode of In Living Color as well as playing Businessman in the Prom Night remake) brings a haunted mirror back to his hip and happening pad. It's not long before the mirror starts distorting reality, shedding some light on the wannabe-artist's past as well as threatening his circle of friends which includes Shaft and Asian-Shannon Doherty in its ranks. Yet another Amityville flick where the Horror happens outside of the iconic house from the Margot Kidder/James Brolin original, it's no surprise to find A New Generation deviating even further from the original formula than before.Not that twisting the formula is such a bad thing -- it sort of worked in Amityville 1992 It's About Time (sort of) -- but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. For those keeping score, Amityville A New Generation is the seventh installment in the shockingly long-winded and consistently mediocre Amityville Horror franchise. It's to be expected that the film isn't exactly top-notch material, but even judging it as a b-movie doesn't do it justice. The plot, if you can call it that, is really just an excuse for the presence of some admittedly cool paintings and softcore nudity (its only redeeming features, really). The horror in this Amityville Horror is in its banality. There is simply no tension to be found, and the bloodshed is kept to a minimum. Add this to the fact that hardly anybody in the film (save for Roundtree and Terry O'Quinn, cashing a check in an otherwise thankless role) can act to save their lives, and you have one very tepid experience.Even those who lapped up the schlock served up in the silly movie-of-the-week Amityville 4 The Evil Escapes or even the aforementioned 1992 affair will be hard-pressed to find anything redeeming about A New Generation. To be quite frank, it's a chore to sit through and even when the film tries to twist things in an effort to re-connect itself to its roots, it just doesn't work. Whatever thrills were to be had with this premise were squeezed out by the anemic sequels that came before. Even if you enjoy cinematic junk food like this, approach with caution.

"},{"Title":"* *1/2 out of 4","Date":"26 November 2007","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":" Struggling artist Keyes Terry, (Ross Partridge) wife Llanie, (Lala Sloatman) and friend Suki, (Julia Nickson-Soul) try to make it with an art show, and manage to take a mystical mirror home. The rest of their friends, Dick, (David Naughton) and Janet Cutler, (Barbara Howard) think it's a useless purchase until a series of accidents plague them and their friends. As the strange occurrences begin to mount, Keyes begins to suspect that the mirror might be responsible. Doing a little digging into it's past, he discovers a startling secret that puts him and his loved ones in grave danger.Really only guilty of being a rather boring film with no real action at all, and it does have enough other moments to really give fans of the series a couple of rather interesting scenes. Take a shot on it, there's worse films out there than this one.Rated R for Violence, Brief Nudity and Profanity.

I mean, I can understand how hard it would be to get rid of an evil house. We're talking starting a horrible fire, bulldozing, flood, etc. But a mirror? How hard could it be can it be to get rid of a mirror?! This was the most horrible movie that could've put the title of Amityville into the picture! Well, a group of friends who are pretty much from the start, are a bunch of freaks. One of them is a photographer of some kind and buys a haunted mirror from a homeless creepy guy, teaching me a valuable lesson, don't buy things from homeless creepy guy. Of course, the horrible deaths and chaos ensues this group, though I can't imagine anyone missing them.Please, skip Amityville A New Generation, I've already got a few complaints about my generation, so I think this was a premonition. Not to sound so crazy. P But believe me, this is horribly acted, not well thought out, and not even scary! I feel so bad for the original writers of The Amityville Horror, they must be crying every time person witnesses this film.1/10 "},{"Title":"WOW another amityville success","Date":"13 October 2002","Score":"2 out of 14 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror","Review":"  Wow Wow Wow i love and live for the amityville movies and this one is another great success the special effects are good acting good horror good everything good good good so ignore everyone else WATCH THIS MOVIE give it a chance it has lots of potential 7/10 "}]
