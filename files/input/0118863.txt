That could be just me though, as this is the first dark comedy I've seen. Despite that I had fun watching it, from the first scene (which, by the way, gives you an awesome view of Joaquin Phoenix's beautiful eyes) up till the very last. Joaquin Phoenix, once again, delivered a memorable performance as Clay. He said his lines with conviction and the right amount of emotions at the right places. I don't know if Vince Vaughn was supposed to be hilarious but he cracked me up. I don't fancy Vince much but I like him in this movie. The plot is pretty unpredictable, and even though it doesn't grip your heart with tension it will maintain your interest until the very end cause you'll be dying to find out what happens to Clay.Overall this film is definitely worth a watch.

I'm glad I rented it, too, because this is one of the best thrillers I've seen in years. Like it's title, there's nothing really complex or intricate about it, and it even follows pretty close to the usual thriller plotline, but it is so well acted and written that it thrills and entertains throughout the entire film.The characters are made up mostly of caricatures. Caricatures, in this case, oddly enough, of the actors performing them rather than the role that needed to be filled in the story. Janeane Garofalo plays the part of an FBI agent assigned to investigate the various murders that begin turning up in a small town. Like most of her characters, she is disillusioned, sarcastic, and continually amazed at the sheer idiocy with which she is surrounded. Vince Vaughn delivers a wonderful performance as the villain, with his endless charm making him the perfect actor to play the part of a serial killer. `They're all charming,' as they say.As is often the case, Joaquin Phoenix also plays a rather unenviable role, as he did in movies like 8MM, To Die For, and Gladiator. He is a good guy in Clay Pigeons, but after you watch the movie it becomes obvious that this guy must just have a serious problem with bad luck. A good friend of Clay's (Phoenix) kills himself in a remote location early in the film because of an affair that Clay has been having with his wife, forcing Clay to alter the scene to make it look like an accidental death in order to avoid looking like he did it to get rid of him so that he could be with his wife.It's strange to notice the absolute absence of any kind of remorse or sadness that this wife shows after her husband kills himself. Clay is freaking out, and this vicious bitch wants to continue their sexual escapades as though nothing has even happened. When Lester Long (Vaughn) shows up, he strikes up a friendship with Clay and, through a bizarre fishing incident, becomes irreversibly intertwined with Clay's murders. Basically they are stuck working together for the rest of the movie no matter how much Clay's hatred for Lester grows. You'll just have to watch the movie to see why.I thought that the ending was a tiny bit of a copout, if only because it involves a situation at a distant roadside diner/caf√© that ends too perfectly. This situation just had way too many variables that could have happened to have come off exactly as it was expected to, but the movie was still so good that it is more than worth it. If you are looking for a great thriller (and you've already seen The Way of the Gun), Clay Pigeons is the way to go.

Joaquin Phoenix is Clay Birdwell, a regular guy whose lack of judgment and discretion catches up with him unexpectedly in this dark, maddening tale of morality and fate that is sometimes morose and disturbing, at other times darkly humorous, as it deftly examines the trappings of the tangled webs we humans weave.  Clay has become mired in a moral dilemma from which there seems to be no escape, when he meets and is befriended by Lester Long (Vince Vaughn), a trucker passing through town one night.  At a local bar, Lester observes that Clay doesn't exactly have a way with women; it gets Lester's attention, which leads to a game of pool and, later on, a casual fishing trip that, like the target practice outing, proves to be a life-altering experience for Clay. 	Phoenix is perfectly cast as Clay, ably conveying the effects of the dark quagmire into which he is cast by circumstances he is unable to control.  His performance enables you to feel him sinking ever deeper as the story moves along, and to empathize with him and experience what he is going through.  You realize that he understands his situation, and it becomes a matter of waiting to see if he will make the right decisions, regardless of the inevitable consequences.  It creates a tension that makes you want to yell at the screen to tell him what to do.  Vaughn is excellent as well as the cowboy trucker with the winning smile, robust laugh and a closet full of dark secrets.  There's a menace behind the good-natured facade he puts on that becomes more pronounced as the events unfold.  Pretty early on you know what this guy is all about, but somehow it only enhances the anxiety of the whole situation as it becomes a cat-and mouse game (with some unexpected twists) between Clay and Lester.  Another notable performance comes from the charismatic Janeane Garofalo, who is surprisingly effective and credible as F.B.I. agent Dale Shelby, who comes to town when things take a turn and begin to heat up.  It's a credit to her talent and versatility that she can pull this character off so well.   	The supporting cast includes Georgina Cates (Amanda), Scott Wilson (Sheriff Mooney), Vince Vieluf (Deputy Barney), and Monica Moench (Kimberly).  There are moments in this movie that absolutely make you want to tear your hair out, a credit to the way Dobkin put this project together and delivered it.  `Clay Pigeons' is a nail-biter that will keep you going right up to the end (which is terrific); Clay and Lester are characters you're going to remember, and just to make sure there's a brief, inspired reminder at the end of the credits (so stay with it all the way).  Relatively overlooked during it's original release, this film should gain new life on video, and deservedly so; this is one you'll be glad you took a look at.  I rate this one 9/10.

He is having an affair with his best friend's wife, Amanda. His best friend, Earl, knows about this, however. Thus he kills himself one day, and cleverly frames Clay for the murder. Clay, feeling both afraid and awkward, covers this incident up by making the death look like a suicide. The police fall for it and Clay puts this mess behind him.   This film, both written and directed by newcomer David Dobkin, is the most original movie I have seen in a long while. Think about it, we haven't had a movie this clever and blackly comic since Fargo, possible one of the best movies I have ever scene. The characters are so unique, while they don't generate much sympathy from the audience; they still are extremely fun to watch.The performances are another great element in the movie. Vince Vaughn portrays Lester Long like he did in the recent Psycho remake. His style, giggle, attitude, and presence are all priceless. Joaquin Phoenix takes us though a funny joyride as he gets into more and more trouble as Clay. Let's not forget Georgina Cates, as the slutty wife of Earl. She plays cocky character who everyone loves to hate. The only character I could find is Janeane Garofalo's, who was surly inspired by Frances MacDormand from Fargo.The film's soundtrack is of the best there is, with songs that not only further the character's motives, but are also catchy and even describe some of the movie's plot at times. I have owned the soundtrack even before I saw the movie, which is quite unusual. But once I heard the theme song to Clay Pigeons The Ballad of Lester Long, I had to get it.I do think that this movie could have been better, however. If it had left a few more elements to the imagination, like the guilt or innocence of Clay Birdwell, and the explicit murder and sex scenes, maybe the viewer would be l bit more involved into the story. A little less plot and a little fewer characters would have also been nice.But those are but minor complaints. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time, and I was not that disappointed. Clay Pigeons is one of the years most entertaining and original films.

So after watching it, I have to say this is without a shadow of a doubt one of the MOST , or possibly the BIGGEST under-rated movie ever!. Honestly I really can't think of any negative to say about it at all, the plot was gripping, funny, intense & the acting...Oooh the acting was OUTSTANDING!

Joaquin Phoenix played his part brilliantly also, this too I think is his best performance ive seen ( And i thought he was superb in Gladiator) The movie does have everything, it's run-time is 104mins, and geez they have managed to fit alot of story in that space of time, it's so fast paced, you can't take your eyes off it! Sadly though there is no region 2 dvd out for it yet, so i had to buy it region 1 which I try not too do, but for a movie of this quality it's worth it.

Director David Dobkin, working with Matt Healye's screen play, has created a film with a western flavor in which a young man has the bad fortune of being around when different dead bodies are found; it doesn't take too long when Clay will be implicated in them.Clay is an auto mechanic who made the mistake of having an affair with one of his buddies' wife. Earl reminds Clay at the beginning of the film when he decides to kill himself. He is convinced his death will have Clay written all over it. What's more, his widow, Amanda, the young and sexy woman who had the affair with Clay wants to continue the relationship now that her old man is gone. Clay, who has been scared out of his mind with what he had witnessed wants to be millions of miles apart from Amanda, who keeps pressuring the young man for sex.One night at the local tavern, Lester Long, a stranger to the town, witnesses how Clay slaps Amanda in front of everyone because he has had it with her. Lester, who appears to be a friendly guy, strikes a conversation with Clay and invites him to go fishing in a nearby lake. That same lake is the place where Clay had taken the corpse of Gloria, who was killed while having sex with him by the deranged Amanda. Little does Clay know who his new friend really is.When the FBI is called to investigate Amanda's own death, things begin to spiral for Clay. Everything is out of control. Agent Shelby thinks Clay is the one responsible for Amanda's killing and a string of others like it in the area. Clay puts two and two together and he realizes who is the killer and puts a plan into action. The last thing we see is Clay leaving town and driving in the opposite direction.Joaquin Phoenix makes Clay come alive in a great reading of this character. Mr. Phoenix is at times the confused man who is perplexed and wonders how anyone can be accusing him of the crimes he supposedly committed. Vince Vaughn is perfect as the reptilian Lester Long. He adds a layer to his character with the nervous laugh he doesn't seem to control. Janeane Garofalo plays FBI agent Shelby with good results. Scott Wilson is seen as Sheriff Mooney who believes in Clay's innocence.The excellent music score provided by John Lurie serves the movie well as does the cinematography of Eric Edwards. David Dobkin directed with assurance, making this film become a good way to spend some time.

Set in Montana, the film's title alludes to our hero, Clay Bidwell (Joaquin Phoenix), a dim-witted country hick who, following his friend's death, sinks deeper and deeper into intractable problems, as a result of his own stupid decisions.It's the kind of setup you would expect when the film's writers devise a plot first, and then create the characters needed to advance the plot. The main problem with Clay Pigeons, therefore, is a contrived plot devoid of characterization. We never really get to know Clay, or any of the characters, in terms of their needs, motivations, backgrounds, or what makes them tick. And that renders a shallow story, and precludes any discernible theme, or broader message. Several obvious plot holes together with improbable coincidences in timing further weaken the script.While the film's concept is flawed and the characterizations are weak, other elements of the script are neither flawed nor weak. The screenplay clearly conforms to a three-act structure, with logical sequences and scenes that keep the drama both coherent and moving, and with conflict, appropriately placed, necessary to engage viewer interest. And the dialogue is engaging and funny, especially as it relates to a somniferous-prone deputy dog named Barney.The film's cinematography is excellent. Production design and costumes are credible. And the music gives the film texture. But what really makes this film enjoyable is the acting. With the exception of Phoenix, who pouts and mumbles his way through, all of the other acting is really good. Georgina Cates chews up the scenery as the no-good vixen. Scott Wilson is a credible sheriff. Janeane Garofalo is spunky and humorous as the FBI's youthful lead agent. And Vince Vaughn (love that laugh of his) is great as the charmingly animated rhinestone cat among the pigeons.Despite a contrived plot and the lack of a theme, Clay Pigeons held my attention, mostly as a result of the film's dialogue, and especially the acting of Garofalo and Vaughn.

All this happens in an opening couple of minutes which really grab your attention. When Clay realises that his friend's sluttish wife isn't going to give him any help, he disposes of the body alone. It looks like he's got away with it as well seeing as the local police &#x96; a doe-eyed, laid-back sheriff and his eager but dim deputy &#x96; know the victim so well that they're inclined to believe Clay's assessment that he got drunk same as every Sunday and accidentally drove over a cliff edge. But then the grieving widow gets jealous when Clay wants nothing more to do with her and she sees him getting off with the waitress in their small town caf√©. Before you know it, Clay has another dead body to despatch (and a leaky water bed to repair).All this happens in the film's first couple of reels, by which time it has veered dangerously towards farce with the murder of the pert waitress in Clay's bed. There should be some kind of quota for murders in small American towns - no more than, say, one every hour of screen time to keep things credible &#x96; otherwise Hicksville USA starts looking like Beirut on a bad day. Anyway, around about then Vince Vaughn makes an appearance and the film slowly goes off on a completely different tack. The twists continue to come at a rapid pace, but what began as a black comedy of small town intrigue and petty jealousy becomes a more conventional 'serial killer in our midst' thriller.Serial killers in movies tend to come in two guises they're either socially inept loners with low self-esteem, or they're swaggering, charismatic rogues at whose feet potential victims fall. Vaughn's Lester Long ('Lester the Molester') falls firmly into the latter character, charming even the unwitting female FBI agent (Janeane Garofolo) on his trail. Many movie killers also have a personal quirk that proves their downfall, and Lester is no exception. However, Clay is so dim and passive that he's really no match for Lester, so the ending rings a little untrue. A braver movie might have had Lester moving on, leaving us to ponder on the fact that to a degree it's the lowering of our own moral standards that enables the likes of Lester to operate relatively freely.Vaughn outshines Phoenix in every scene they share, which is no mean feat. He exudes an effortless charm edged with a hint of menace that tips over every now and then to reveal the insanity lurking beneath the smooth veneer. It's a difficult trick to pull off, and while Vaughn isn't entirely successful he's still pretty good. Phoenix gets little to do other than look scared or stupid, and I wonder whether he would have accepted such a role a few years later when his career had really taken off. Although there's a noir-ish, Jim Thompson feel to the film, the director resists the temptation to fill the screen with menacing shadows &#x96; two deaths take place in bright daylight, another by seductive lamplight.Clay Pigeons is a clever little movie which will keep you watching until the final credits, even though its killer opening means you'll probably be left feeling it lost its way a little by the end.

However, at least I must like it... whatever it is.It's a story which doesn't really fit easily into any particular genre. It's not really thrilling enough to be a thriller. It doesn't have any element of a 'who-dun-it' as every death is pretty much self explanatory and there's certainly no action in it. Perhaps the best category &#x96; if this IS even a category &#x96; is 'serial killer' film... as there are plenty of bodies piling up here and there.It's about a man &#x96; Clay, played by Joaquin Phoenix &#x96; who just seems to attract death and destruction all around him. He can't seem to go a day in his small American town without someone he knows getting killed &#x96; normally horribly. And this trend is set to get worse when he meets Lester, played by (a slim) Vince Vaughn, who also seems to just want to kill pretty much everyone in his way.What follows isn't your average story. There are no 'damsels in distress' who conveniently need to be rescued in the final act. And, talking of final acts, there isn't the traditional stand-off between hero and villain in some dramatic place, like the top of a high-rise building. Perhaps that's why the film has such an odd feel to it. It doesn't really conform to any sort of blueprint. You just follow the lives of these &#x96; murderous &#x96; characters and see where it takes you.If you like the sound of that, you should get something out of this film. It has the feel of a film-maker's early work where he's still allowed enough freedom not to conform to every Hollywood convention. However, a word of caution, if you're looking for 'relatable' characters then you probably won't find any here. All of them, even Clay, are hardly the sort of people you'd want to hang around with. But then that's why you probably won't mind seeing them bumped off one by one. "},{"Title":"Psychopathic quirkiness","Date":"28 July 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" The indie quirk is a familiar substance that can be a lot of fun in the right situation. Clay Pigeons is just what we're looking for. It's an offbeat film about Clay Bidwell, played by Joaquin Phoenix, whose life takes a dark turn after his best friend commits suicide after finding out Clay has been sleeping with his wife, Amanda. Clay, not wanting anybody to find out about him and Amanda, disposes of the body. This leads to a bundle of lies that pile on one another and are further complicated by the arrival of a mysterious cowboy named Lester Long. Clay quickly learns some very dark secrets about Lester and is forced into helping him keep those secrets. It's a twisted and backwards ride that at times doesn't even feel real it is so bizarre. This film is loads of fun and is a thrilling joy to watch.Clay Pigeons is a film that seems to take itself seriously, but also has a very dark, very grim, sense of humor that pokes its head out in all the wrong places. It comes out in the form of sickening irony and strange satire that plays up the film's dark quirkiness. But these nuances never feel forced and they always seem appropriate for the kind of atmosphere Clay Pigeons tries to capture. The film stays consistent with its dark mood. It gets intense but there's always a hint of sadistic humor hidden in the seriousness of the film.It achieves this balance of two tones through a variety of things. One such element would be the ironically twangy score. There are scenes of murder and violence set to the dueling banjos we're all so familiar with. The film is consistently driven by a very country score that feels so odd and out of place that it makes the film feel just right in all its offbeat finesse. David Dobkin, the film's director, shoots Clay Pigeons with a quirky camera eye with certain shots that are set up very well and capture an ironic intensity that makes the film feel even stranger.And there's no way to talk about this film without mentioning the fantastic performances from the two leads, Joaquin Phoenix and Vince Vaughn. Phoenix is the unfortunate sucker who gets dragged into the events of the film, constantly wanting out but never being able to find a way to escape. Vaughn is the villain of the film who is entertaining yet disturbing. He is an incredibly fun character but also incredibly creepy. You're never too sure what is going on in his disturbed mind and Vaughn pulls off his offbeat edge perfectly. From the horribly stereotypical cowboy get-up to the hilarious yet slightly unsettling laugh, Vince Vaughn's portrayal of the devilish Lester Long is on the nose.Clay Pigeons is one of those films that you have to see to believe. It is very strange and it is difficult to know what to make of it, but there's something about it that is ironically fun. It is quirky, it is offbeat, and yet it is serious. Everything about the film matches this mishmash of moods and makes the film feel completely strange overall. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed this film for the strange little ball of odd it was.

The movie had some buzz behind it upon its release in 1998, however I never got around to checking it out. A few months ago, while listening to my podcast of choice, the movie review show Cinecast (recently renamed as Filmspotting), Pigeons was brought back into my consciousness. It is a well-made effort&#151;dark subject matter mixed with pitch black humor. This is vintage Vaughn who really lights up the screen with his infectious smile; even the high-pitched hyena laugh stays in tact as he must not have been asked to tone it down as it seems his more recent films have required. Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who seems to not be able to catch a break. How many times must one character take care of dead bodies that he hasn't even killed? Everyone has something to hold over him so that he must cover up the chaos happening in the town. Pigeons is shot well and nicely paced. It's a shame Dobkin seems to have forgone the edge this film contains for more general fare like Crashers and the forthcoming Vaughn vehicle Joe Claus. He shows some nice flare and hopefully will continue making entertaining movies.

"},{"Title":"There are some people out there who need killing'',","Date":"7 September 2005","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" It's hard to categorize a movie like Clay Pigeons. The film is certainly an interesting mix of genres - part satire, comedy, and melodrama, and it gives the scoundrel the best lines, the most machiavellian aura, and the keenest temperament in the story. There's no doubt the movie, which takes place in a small Montana town, is a work of considerable originality.The story is fraught with murder, sex, and mayhem, and contains some of the most deliciously convincing characters ever seen on film. There's the stable scout, slatternly tart, laid-back law-officer, magnetic mischief maker, and caustic cop - all of them coming together at different stages to create a maelstrom of confusion and violence.Director David Dobkin and scriptwriter Matt Healy don't waste a lot of time on exposition The story opens on a shooting match as best friends Earl (Fregory Sporleder) and Clay (Joaquin Phoenix) test their skills at shattering beer bottles. Earl suddenly turns on Clay, accusing him of having an affair with his sluttish wife, Amanda (Georgina Cates).Earl eventually turns the gun on himself, partly because he's fed up with Amanda's antics, but also because he reckons that he can set it up to look like a murder, thus framing Clay. Afterwards, Clay returns to the newly widowed, but conspicuously unconcerned Amanda and is disgusted by her lack of distress.At first Amanda tells Clay to get lost, yet deep down she still desires him. After he spurns her advances, she begins stalking him which results in terrible and fatal consequences for them both. Soon Clay is plunged into an ambivalent fellowship with the engaging visitor, Lester Long (Vince Vaughn). Lester is an enigmatic cowboy drifter, who's swollen cowboy Panama matches his towering personality. Complete with sly giggle, he's aware that he can work his charms on men as well as women.Soon Clay finds himself having to dispose of a dead body, but to add to his problems, he finds himself confronted with the sardonically deadpanned Janeane Garofalo as a pot-smoking federal agent Shelby and unexcitable local sheriff Mooney (Scott Wilson). Mooney seems enveloped in a melancholic haze from suddenly having to deal with so many dead people, while the permanently tough-minded Shelby is hot on the trail of a serial killer.Phoenix is terrific as the bewildered good guy, who mostly through no fault of his own lets everything disintegrate around him. Garofalo is also good as the mordant, but focused Shelby, and her reaction when a lusty cowboy attempts to pick her up in the village bar, is absolutely priceless.Best of all is Vince Vaughn who shows his depth in a wholly distinct, ominous performance. His congeniality covers up a startling penchant for something much darker and his contempt is excited by the ease with which his victims flock to his all American allure.Clay Pigeons is a quirky, pitch-black comedy-thriller, in which everything turns out the contrary of what you'd expect. With dead bodies piling up all over the place one wouldn't expect movie like this to have such an amusingly mean-spirited groove. But that's why it's so good, especially when one considers the surprise finale, which neatly cleans up all the mess and confusion that precedes it. Mike Leonard September 05.

His best friend Earl (Gregory Sporleder), having discovered that Clay has been sleeping with his wife Amanda (Georgina Cates), goes about committing suicide right in front of Clay's eyes; and making it appear that Clay was in fact responsible. When turning to Amanda for help proves futile, Clay takes it upon himself to roll his friend's car off a cliff, burning any incriminating evidence. But despite her husband's body not yet even being cold, and Clay's clear disgust, Amanda tries in vain to continue pursuing a relationship of infidelity. Her outrage over Clay's rejection is further fuelled when he begins seeing local waitress, Gloria (Nikki Arlyn). In retaliation Amanda shoots Gloria&#133;. And Clay's life just gets messier and messier as he is forced to dispose of her body as well, for fear of Amanda exposing the truth behind Earl's death to the police.Amidst all this chaos, Clay meets Lester (Vince Vaughn), and finds in this stranger an amiable fishing-buddy&#133; Amanda also finds him to be a substitute for Clay. But while on a fishing trip with Lester, both come across a dead girl's body floating in the river; neither are particularly shocked by the discovery. For Clay that makes a hefty body count of 3, and as he is forced to report his finding, the police believe him to have now discovered 2 bodies in the last week. Things are not looking good. And the added discovery of a very dead Amanda is not helping Clay much when a detective is called in from out of town, Agent Shelby (Janeane Garofalo) who believes him to be a serial killer who has already racked up a body count of 7 across the state. Now Clay not only has to prove his own innocence, but also try and stop the man he knows to be the killer&#133;.none other than his deranged fishing buddy, Lester the molester. 'Clay Pigeons' is entertaining, but slightly less so that other movies of its genre.The cast is strong; though you really can't go wrong with Vince Vaughn as a psycho killer and Joaquin Phoenix as the brooding protagonist. Garofalo however gives a somewhat lack-luster performance, in which she is just going though the motions in a monotone voice. Not even her normally shining humor or quick-wit is wholly present. There are also times in the film when humor would be much appreciated. More specifically though, blatant humor, so that there was no confusion of where the appropriate laughs are intended. It's a fine line since your not entirely sure whether to be deeply disturbed or in stitches of laughter by Lester. With a charismatic yet sinister laugh and hilarious cow-boy getup, the film's bad guy is a sort of oxymoron. Do we laugh at him? Do we hate him? Its just a little confusing when you have a famous comedian like Garofalo, and an actor known for his comedic roles, Vaughn; but your made to believe that the film is actually a crime thriller. It feels like Joaquin should have played the bad guy; with his pointed stare and dark, ominous presence. And while there is a sense of hilarity with the situation Clay finds himself in; whatever amusement can be drawn is dampened with somewhat gruesome scenes of deaths and decaying bodies.Still, the film's climax is thrilling and unpredictable. And, overall, it is worth a watch. Just don't expect to be blown away.

Having seen it at least 20 times now, I still chuckle my way through, and re-fall in love with Vince Vaughn. Though Clay Pigeons did cop a bit of flack by critics for having a 'weak script' (hardly) i view it as a more intelligent film for the black-comedy fan. If you watch mainstream top 10 rubbish, you probably won't enjoy it. The two main characters, played by Vinca Vaughn and Joaquin Phoenix, are amazing. Vaughn shines as the oh so charismatic cowboy, Lester Long. Vaughn has obviously developed his character down to the little kick in his walk, the charming laugh. Lester is almost Vaughn in Psycho, but cocky &#150; women fall at his feet, he just has 'it.' Trust me, after you watch this film, you'll wish Lester was your best bud. Phoenix is also terrific, caught in a web of comic murders, the charming Lester and half-wit police. It reminds me very much of U-Turn; the little backwards town, the murders, the sticky web.

Their Sunday ends with Clay learning a thing or two about friendships, big mouthed vixens with pure evil in their heart, and his education on the a to z's of planning a perfect cover-up.

Now, his best friend's new widow,Amanda (Georgina Cates) decides she done like her this Clay fellow and is none too keen on his running around with another gal...She even makes a sultry attempt at corralling the young buck at the local watering hole and he causes a bit of a scene by declining her feminine offerings via a strong back hand across her lily white face.

I disagree with others' idea of  the premise to me, this poor guy (Phoenix) has a fling with his friend's wife, then gets trapped by a building number of dead bodies. It's a you won't believe what happened to me premise, and Phoenix  has to cover up all the dead bodies or he will get  charged with the murders, none of which he commits. But he feels guilty nonetheless, which is to his credit, as far as I'm  concerned. Counts against the film the wife is an over-the-top evil woman, with absolutely no reason to exist except to be evil and  drag Phoenix down with her. Once she is out of the way, however, the story picks up. The ending, though, is a bit confusing the  first time through, and I'm still not sure I get how it worked.The performances are pretty good, though Vaughn as the serial killer is great; his high-pitched giggle is perfect. Garofalo's deadpan FBI agent is also great.    Worth seeing, but don't expect heavy thinking or intense attitude. Enjoy the scenery, the soundtrack.

It hardly seems worth the fuss. It's a contrived potboiler with tiny shades of David Lynch, the Coen brothers and Tarantino, and even Hitchcock. In fact, the film appears to be mostly a redneck version of Hitchcock's 'Strangers on a Train.' It also has an interesting cast, although in the end it is the characters that matter and no casting can save what isn't written or directed well. Vaughn's part is the showiest and he has the looks and zest to make it work, but his Lester Long character is played too loudly. There's no undercurrent of madness or menace, no dropping down of voice or personality to reveal the evil behind the mask of charming bravado. And such a flamboyant persona on a traveling mass murderer would make him stand out a mile during an investigation. Indeed, this film's own lack of subtlety is a big part of its problem. It sets up Phoenix's 'Clay' character's dilemma early on, but strains credibility by adding on another murder and then shoehorning in, by utter coincidence, a serial killer (Vaughn's 'Lester Long') to pile up the body count. In fact, even the set-up suicide at the beginning is forced the humiliated husband would simply kill Phoenix then himself, maybe even the wife, too. He wouldn't go through all the trouble to set things up just so he'll be dead with the idea that Phoenix will be accused of murder. In the history of sexual affair crimes when has that scenario ever been seen? And then we follow with another killing by another character (Georgina Cates as the widow) to be followed by Vaughn's 'Lester' popping up to do so more killing. C'mon, now, this is silly. Then there is a pair of federal agents showing up to investigate and we get Janeane Garofalo and John Morris. Now, I think Garofalo is adorable with a low-key presence that is just right for the film (and an antidote to the histrionics of Vaughn) but I can't buy her as a long-time cop. Not for a second. She's slumming as a guest star here (Special Fun Appearance by Ms. Janeane Garofalo) and her partner Morris is something out of an Esquire magazine fashion ad (Special Non-Speaking Performance by Male Model) About the only on-the-money characters are Sheriff Mooney and the slutty widow. Scott Wilson is perfect as the Sheriff and quite believable. Unlike his deputy (named 'Barney' - oh, brother!) the character is not played as a yokel who is in over his head. Then there is the evil widow, played by Georgina Cates, who is letter perfect in the role. Not only that, but Cates is an English actress, yet you can't detect even a hint of her natural accent. And on the pulchritude scale, she and Nikki Arlyn (as the waitress-victim) rate highly. And as for Phoenix, he tries... but it's hard to get behind a character low enough to have an affair with his best friend's wife, and who also can't seem to summon the intelligence to deal with the psychotic personalities of Cates and Vaughn. I also agree with many others who feel that the ending is a sloppy cop-out. It's an attempt at adding one more trick but it seems as contrived as everything else more about cleverness than common sense.

No matter how fierce the fire or how hard the impact of a car crash if someone has been shot dead before the crash then the bullet wounds would still so up in a post mortem .

Notice right from the beginning scenes how the world is very surreal, with the beautiful deep blue sky, crisp white puffy clouds, rich green grass, and the (older but very well maintained and restored) pastel (and one red) colored pickup trucks.

Some may be leftovers from a scene edited out, but I prefer to think that it is just good character development.

The incident upon which the whole plot depends is a suicide that the victim has made to look like a murder by Clay (Phoenix), who had been having an affair with the dead man's wife. Never mind that the victim's fingerprints are all over the gun - Clay panics and pushes the victim and his truck over a cliff rather than admit to the affair and report the truth. What makes this decision all the more ludicrous is that we later learn that the sheriff and Clay are old buds. When evidence from two murders that happen consequential to the initial incident point definitively to Clay as the killer, the sheriff still refuses to believe that he is guilty.Everything else about the story is pretty ridiculous, too. How did the murder weapon get into Clay's fireplace? And, wouldn't the murderer have placed it in a more obvious location, since his whole point was to set up Clay? How does Clay know where to find the murderer when he escapes from jail? How does Agent Shelby (Garafaolo) know where to go, and why would she go alone after a serial killer who's about twice her size? Why does Clay misdirect Shelby when she gets there? Why is the last bit of trickery, when Lester(Vaughan) thinks he's taking a ride to New Mexico with Robert necessary?

It has three established, credible young (at the time) actors in the lead roles, and it has elements of a suspenseful thriller with a healthy dose of humor. It's also an impressive debut for director David Dobkin, who directed music videos prior to working on this film. Dobkin would go on to direct some great movies, such as Wedding Crashers (2005). Unfortunately, while this film has its strengths, its weaknesses lie primarily in the storytelling and the motives of the main character, Clay Bidwell (Joaquin Phoenix).By no means was Phoenix terrible in this movie. He is a great actor. However, he had very little to work with here. Phoenix plays a small-town gas station attendant whose friend Earl (Gregory Sporleder), in the very beginning of the film, shoots himself in front of him. The reason is because Earl is not particularly intelligent and could possibly be insane, but mainly because he knows Clay has been having an affair with his wife Amanda (Georgina Cates). In the first improbable scenario of this movie, Earl commits suicide in a way he claims makes it look like Clay did it. Since the camera backtracks at this moment, you don't see him very well, and you wonder how in the world Earl can make it looks like homicide after dying instantly. Does he throw the gun towards Phoenix after he shoots himself? Impossible.However, Clay, apparently lacking in common sense, puts Earl in a car and makes it look like he died while drunk driving. The reason why he didn't tell the police what actually happened is never explained. This is not the first time in the movie I wondered what was going through Clay's head.Later, Clay understandably cuts his relationship off with Amanda, who happens to be a shallow slut and does not remorse over the death of her husband. Amanda gets jealous, and kills Clay's next girlfriend while he is making love to her. It does not occur to Clay to call the police (again!), or even kill Amanda out of self defense. Instead, Clay makes things harder for himself by dragging his dead girlfriend's bullet-ridden body out to a river. As he's doing this, you can't help but wonder, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST CALL THE POLICE!?!?!?The problem is that Phoenix's character, who is supposed to be the moral compass of this film, isn't established well enough. It would be nice to know what is going on in his head, or at least get some explanation as to whether or not he trusts the police and why. There could have been a brief subplot where he got in trouble as a kid for snitching on a felon, or some life-altering event that happened to him earlier on. He could also just be a really stupid guy, but such a characteristic is also not extrapolated upon here.So where does Vince Vaughn come in? Well, he plays Lester Long, a tall, denim-wearing modern cowboy who's altogether a colorful character and a seemingly nice guy. He befriends Clay at a local bar one night, and they hit it off pretty well. Unfortunately, a body (supposidly that of a woman) pops up from the river when they're fishing together one day, and a murder mystery that I won't give away ensues.Such murders pile up in this small town (presumably in Wyoming), and it's too much for the local sheriff (Scott Wilson) to handle. FBI Agent Dale Shelby (Janeane Garofalo) comes in to investigate, and the mystery progresses. The intensity of the climactic chase and murder scenes following Garofalo's entrance is quite extreme, which makes the film worth watching. Although Garofalo's character is supposed to be straight-laced, she is still a colorful character, and she has some great lines. They may not be laugh-out-loud, but Garofalo was still well cast.Similarly, Vaughn was perhaps the best thing about this movie. It's interesting too, because Vaughn is not a character actor. In the many movies he has been in, he usually plays himself, or sort of the same wise-cracking character (Swingers (1996), Made (1999), Wedding Crashers (2005)). Here, he's still over the top, but the down home country boy he plays is still believable. When he played this role, he was still an up-and-coming actor, and not the A-lister he is today. Still, even if you know him from his big budget roles, you don't think he's Vince Vaughn even though he's not wearing any prosthetics.If, judging from this film alone, you were to guess which actor would go on to be nominated for two Academy Awards for acting, you would probably pick Vaughn, not Phoenix. Although it's not entirely Phoenix's fault that his character was so weak and underdeveloped, he also shares some blame for maintaining the same morose expression on his face regardless of the situation. He doesn't seem to show any signs of shock when people die in front of him, nor is there any stress on his face when he is being interrogated by the FBI.

A perfect mixture of humor and tension culminates into an interesting tale of psychotic obsession. Whether or not you think that Clay and Lester are the same person, or whether you see the film as straight forward are completely up for interpretation, but either way it's a damn entertaining and stylish thriller/comedy flick.Awesome alt-country soundtrack.

Oh, it's leisurely and the plot is nothing special, but the overall impact on the viewer is likely to be positive.The acting, for instance, is pretty good. Joaquin Phoenix seems to have gotten bonier as he's matured and has acquired some character. He's alright, and the director gives him room. When his ex-girl friend shoots his current lover, he throws the perpetrator against a wall and pressing her with his left forearm he repeatedly punches his right fist against the wood panel next to her head. Then he pauses, his triceps quivering, holds the position for an unusually long period, and then he delivers another blow to the smashed wood. It's a tiny wordless explosion of impotent rage, and it's perfectly timed. Phoenix is suspected of multiple murders actually committed by a recent acquaintance. He's afraid to go to the police because, well, things would look a little fishy, what with his knowing the victims and having struck one of them just before she disappeared.Janeane Garofalo is petite and not strikingly beautiful as an FBI agent who smokes grass and then eats pizza, and all the while the gears in her brain are still whirling. She's businesslike, utters clipped, sarcastic remarks, and has a smile full of dazzlingly white teeth that belong in a commercial for Bright Strip. Okay. Strictly routine. But then we see her in a bar, getting into some scotch, and she is getting hit on by Vince Vaughn who, unbeknownst to her, is the serial killer she's searching for. Here's the thing about that scene. Considering what we've seen of her character so far, we fully expect her to advise Vaughn to take up residence in a place where the sun don't shine -- but no! Like an actor in a Greek drama, she holds up another persona. She becomes girlish and responsive, flattered by Vaughn's clumsy and overobvious attention, and playful with him before he hustles off with his next victim, leaving Garafolo clearly a little unhappy. Again, it isn't much, not a display of thespian fireworks, but it TELLS us something we wouldn't have guessed about her. She's a woman under that badge and behind that gun. Her character has acquired another dimension. She's no longer a stereotype. And the scene impresses on us the fake rapport that the killer can generate in strangers.Vince Vaughn has the showiest role, a big, affable, charming, slightly dumb cowboy with a yen for cutting up cute girls into little pieces. His performance, alas, is as bland as his face, although it's professional. He doesn't blow it. He just doesn't bring much to the party.Scott Wilson is the local sheriff. He's turned into a decent character actor, light years away from his murderer in In Cold Blood. He's feeble, shuffling, spare of speech, and a little morose, as if filled with guilt for having slaughtered the Clutter family.The score is quite original too. None of it is what you'd expect from a movie about a serial murderer. There are some country and western tunes in the background, Elvis Presley, Moon Over Montana, reflecting the rather dreary social atmosphere of the town. As Vaughn says at one point, Country music is an acquired taste. (Garofalo's reply No it isn't. I've listened to it and hated it from the beginning. Scotch is an acquired taste.) But then the underscore comes up with some strange sounds indeed. Tympani are repeatedly swept up and down as if rolling over Montana's hills. Odd, unexpected clicks and clacks. It doesn't distract the viewer and it comes across as apt in a queer way. But the score isn't of a piece either. It's made up of multiple discordant riffs drawn from different quarters and pasted together. It's a nicely judged piece of work, striking a neat mean between being loud and edgy and being soft and dull. The script itself may be routine but the actors and the director lend it fresh dimensions.

The cast helps a lot. Ms. Garofalo participates in some particularly effective scenes; check out her pizza ordering, and aborted barroom pick-up scene.

Everyone knows that vehicles always explode when this is done, and this one does too, though the director teases us a little about it.Well, OK.  What next? Well, the Sheriff doesn't have a medical exam done because the coroner is on vacation in that far off land, Wyoming (two or three hundred miles away.)

However his cover-up and rejection of Amanda leads to a second death. Meanwhile a body shows up that turns out not to be one that Clay hid but rather one that a serial killer has dumped there, bringing the FBI in to investigate the murders and finding clues that lead them to suspect Clay.Not entirely sure what to expect from it, I decided to give this film a try on the basis of the names involved. The strange opening premise and the following murder by Amanda show that plot logic is not going to play a big part in proceedings but it still has enough of a story to keep it interesting. There is perhaps a bit too much of the post-Tarantino obsession with mixing violence with humour but it does work reasonably well because it avoids being too obvious about it for the most part. The weaknesses in the story and the lack of real characters do weaken it a lot though and I did occasionally find it hard to care about because it wasn't doing anything beneath the surface for me.The cast are OK but nothing special. Phoenix is a good presence but his character didn't convince me and he doesn't always seem to know what best to do with himself. Vaughn is also a strange character but at least his performance is interesting and lively. Garofalo and Morris are the quirky cops but the material isn't really there for them to do much with.
