It is a wonderful story of contrasts of scenery, emotions, beliefs, and people.  While heavy in language and violence, the movie is one I would definitely recommend.  David Thewlis is emotionally endearing as our hero, and Jason Isaacs absolutely delicious in his portrayal of a villain.  Or is there a villain in this movie?  Both characters remain on opposite side of the spectra of good and evil, yet somehow we find ourselves pitying the two evildoers.  Emotions are swept around mercilessly, and you are left completely satisfied with all characters (especially the nun, who is reminiscent of the love/hate, restraint/indulgence conflicts of the film).  I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie and a great story.

This movie is perhaps better understood and appreciated by Ulster folk, though, as it contains a lot of in-jokes that may go over the heads of viewers who are unfamiliar with our area. We who live here can really relate to the situations depicted in the film, as well as to the satire that is so typical of Bateman's work and which translated rather well to film. I believe this movie is misclassified as a thriller. It is a satire, a black comedy, and the thriller format is just a vehicle. The situations were dead on and hilarious (in a very dark way sometimes), and the accents were quite good, in general, with the exception of Robert Lindsay (Brinn) who sounded fake to my ear. The taxi driver was perhaps one of the most realistic characters in the film, and even though she was only seen a couple of times, she stole those scenes. Well acted, realistic, fast paced and quite a good look at our province.

Apart from the excess of swearing (am a bit of a prude), I found this film to be funny and a refreshing change from all the doom/gloom and disaster that seems to be normally associated with productions centering around Northern Ireland/Ulster/The Province (see movie for reference and explanation). There is a lot in the movie that I can relate to for some reason, even though I am Scottish, not Irish and have never lived amongst The Troubles. The story (and screen play adapted by the author - an Irishman - so not quite sure where the comment about poor representation by the British comes in) is a simple one, and shows the humour and sense of openness and idea of ridiculousness displayed and recognised by the Irish. It doesn't hide the fact that there no go areas in Belfast and its surrounds, it doesn't hide the fact that there is violence going on, but neither does it hide the fact that the Irish are warm, funny, intelligent human beings. I enjoyed David Thewlis' performance, but feel that he is a very under-rated actor, being used for mostly baddies or yokel character parts on both sides of the Atlantic. The DVD I have had interviews with all the cast and gives an insight in to the making of the film, the most telling part of that being that the film crew were denied access to areas of the city, until the locals found out what they were filming and then welcomed them with open arms, because this book/film did not depict them in a depressing manner. No the story isn't Ulysses, but it is fun and anyone (with celtic roots especially) can find something to relate to in it, be it the apparent obsession on the radio stations with country and western (same in Scotland), Starkey pretending to be a gravel inspector when he falls over drunk (shades of the late Chick Murrey - a Scots comedian - who when he fell over drunk in the street was asked by a passing woman are you alright Chick. He replied - yes I'm just trying to break a bar of chocolate in my back pocket!) or people supplementing their poor income with another job - in this case as a strippergram nun. The spiel on the box likens it to Trainspotting - but I would say maybe more along the lines of Bill Forsythe's Gregory's Girl - with kalishikovs!

It's good to see David Thewlis, one of the finest British actors of his generation, play the lead in a British film &#150; as he did in his prime, and not a side character in Hollywoodian films like Harry Potter. His performance in Divorcing Jack isn't quite as remarkable as the one he gave five years before in Naked but it's fantastic by its own right, and just like in Naked Thewlis creates an anti-hero that is egoistic, weak, detestable, and entirely believable; if you're looking for a noble hero to sacrifice himself for the greater good because that's the right thing to do, look elsewhere. Dan Starkey cares for himself and makes excuses for nobody; and that makes him a protagonist you can relate to.There are some neat surprises in the supporting cast Australian born Rachel Griffiths &#150; AKA Brenda Chenowith of HBO's terrific Six Feet Under &#150; who was practically anonymous in 1998, is terrific as Thewlis' prostitute-in-nun's-clothing sidekick, and supplies some of the film's funniest moments. Jason Isaacs, who, like Thewlis, has recently familiarized himself with American audiences through the Harry Potter movies, in bone-chillingly excellent in the lead villain role. The beautiful Laura Fraser (who had recently made a career for herself in Hollywood with supporting roles in movies like Titus, Vanilla Sky, and A Knight's Tale; but anyone who happened to catch the excellent BBC mini-series Neverwhere will surely remember her as the charming Door) has a part that's brief but unforgettable. American TV regular Richard Grant is lovely and believable as the visiting reporter from the US who came to cover the upcoming elections but is more interested in learning about the difference between the different types of scotch. And experienced British actor Robert Lindsay steals the show as the dodgy candidate. Finally, a brief but hilarious cameo from the charming Bronagh Gallagher (The Commitments) as a taxi driver.The film's messages about the horrors and idiocy of war and particularly the Irish civil war are familiar and would have been corny in a straight drama, but as in Catch-22 and other classic black comedies, the absurd humor of the film makes it powerful. If you take any of the two aspects of the film &#150; comedic or political &#150; and separate it from the other, maybe it really isn't all that good. Perhaps that's why it failed to find its audience in the US and most of Europe. Myself, I've lived my entire life in Israel, and am familiar with a war between two neighboring factions that always seems on the brink of resolution just before the situation explodes again, and that has its highest price in the innocent lives of people on both sides who just want to be left alone in peace, while the leaders of both peoples carry on their senseless warmongering. Divorcing Jack has a simplistic view of the situation but it's important to make it heard. The ending is inevitable and almost predictable, yet it's the only proper ending this story could possibly have. Divorcing Jack is highly recommended; it's neither a romantic comedy nor a straight thriller, but it's a good and powerful film to enjoy and to think about.

It even (spoiler!) kills off the black guy more-or-less on cue - you know, all those movies with (say) 3 goodies, and one of them is black and you just KNOW who's going to get wasted first.But then there's the way it's told.

None of the he's dead - he's alive - oh, now he's really dead - oh, wait, no he's not that infests so many movies. I'm also glad there was no attempt to show the (spoiler!)

Watch out for the armoured mail-van (dismissed as unrealistic by one irony-impaired reviewer), and listen to the hoodlums happily reminiscing about a previous murder - far more funny, chilling, and convincing than any Tarantino patter about coffee or fast-food.Easily the best example of REAL Irish humour since the Commitments.

Unfortunately the nun, who is really a nurse by day and a stripper by night, isn't a major character in the movie, but her appearances where still pretty cool, and there were plenty of gags around the nun to keep me amused. The movie was good enough to stand on its own anyway, the nun just made it more interesting.Divorcing Jack is a political, conspiracy, black British comedy and very much lived up to my expectations. It is based around a journalist, Don Starky, who invites a young, attractive university student back to his house for a party. Starky is already married, and is not interested in this girl, but she has other ideas and manages to get her wicked way with him. Unfortunately his wife finds him in the act and throws him out and he is forced to move in with the girl. Unfortunately he returns back from getting a Pizza to find that the girl has been murdered, and then accidentally kills her mother because he thinks she is the murder. Even worse, he discovers that the girl was the daughter and the woman the wife, of an Irish politician in fact the treasurer. All of this is happening at a time when elections are being held and peace is being promised by the leading candidate. To add a further twist, the girl's ex-boyfriend is Billy Culgan, a rather nasty bankrobber and IRA soldier who is in gaol. Thus Starky becomes the prime suspect and is caught up in this political game.I guess this movie is about secrets, the truth, and how peace is really only a shallow lie that is used to cover up huge amounts of tension. This movie is a very strong mouthpiece that reports on the violence that is tearing Northern Ireland apart, and Don Starky is the person who controls the mouthpiece. A couple of times he comments of the number of names that Northern Ireland has because of the number of people that are competing over control of this small state the British and the Irish, the Protestants and the Catholics. The Irish want freedom from the British, but under that there is a huge religious tension that is constantly ripping the country apart - and every time a peace plan comes along, it is only shortlived before something happens which rips the country apart again. It is interesting to note that Scotland and Wales are gaining their own parliaments now.The religious violence is interesting because people attack religion claiming that it is the major causes of wars. This I disagree with - it might be an excuse for a war but it generally is not the cause of a war. In this situation, it seems that the whole reason behind the Protestant - Catholic violence in Northern Ireland has been forgotten and they simply fight because they hate each other. I believe the reason stemmed back to the protestants being English and because the Irish hated the English they remained Catholic - but I can only gather this from the history books.Divorcing Jack is a very good movie about the pointlessness of violence, the lies and conspiracies that run riot through areas of unrest and giving us the idea that peace in Ireland is not just around the corner - it is built on centuries of prejudice and hatred and can't simply be solved by one smiling man.

Fuelled by alcohol, his witty narration opens the door to the banter of Belfast life. Ulster's unique sense of  humour- heavy sarcasm laced with very colourful language, is captured extremely well and is cleverly used not only to develop the characters but to set a lively pace. Starkey is an intriguing character. Whilst trying to bring order to his marriage and increasingly wayward personal life, he seeks as much disorder as possible in the new Blairite era of Northern Ireland politics. Set in 1999, sound-bites and political correctness have given way to the more familiar fire-and-brimstone and tribalism. One gets the feeling that the script-writer got a little caught up in the recent euphoria surrounding the NI peace settlement talks, and took it upon himself to accelerate the pace of change- a dangerous premise in a conflict lasting nearly a thousand years.A chance meeting with a young Art student Maggie (Laura Fraser) leads to an unlikely, but very compelling relationship. The Black Irish beauty of young Maggie contrasts sharply with Starkey's stern-faced wife, reminiscent of those hardened Belfast mothers that fill news reports in the aftermath of violence. After introducing an interesting set of characters, frustratingly the film blows its potential and reverts to type.Cue the terrorists. Maybe one day, someone will make a film about real people who live in Northern Ireland. People who share the same experiences with people in England and Scotland. Highs, lows, laughter, sadness, love, romance- all free of any paramilitary involvement. Neil Jordan's The Crying Game came closest but still he had to use the terrorist springboard to develop his curious love story. These terrorists, both Loyalist and Republican, seem to be a cross between trigger-happy Young Guns and the Keystone Cops. This is the first fundamental flaw of this film. In attempting to include both sets of extremists in one plot, the producers show either great naiveté or ill-advised artistic license. The acutely informed Ulster population (and an increasingly knowledgeable British public) will dismiss such a concept. Ulster is a divided society, and divided usually means that rival groups generally do not mix, particularly extremists.To suggest that they not only do they mix, but both collude with the same politician is quite frankly ludicrous. This is such a shame because the politician in question, Michael Brinn (Robert Lindsay) has great potential as a character. Played with the usual gusto one would expect from Lindsay, Brinn is the ultimate modern politician, seemingly able to build a political platform across the religious divide through a stage-managed combination of  sensitivity, intelligence and charm. Again, as a character, he is hijacked by a ridiculous notion that he managed to hide his active terrorist past right up to election day. We are all only too aware of the histories of Ulster's real politicians and it is an insult to the electorate of Northern Ireland to suggest that they would be gullible enough to vote for such a person.The second major flaw is the plot, which only begins to develop after an hour. Without getting involved in the complexities, the ping-pong movements of Starkey between the two terrorist groups and the local politicians amidst a rising body count and miraculously managing to avoid the law, becomes farcical. The ineffectiveness of the police is not helped by their appearance, resembling Gatwick Airport security rather than the imposing green-clad RUC in steel land Rovers, an image with which the whole world is familiar.It never ceases to amaze me in these type of films, how with a large cast and crew originating from the Province, that so many glaring inaccuracies manage to make their way into the film. Starting with the terrorist gangs who openly tout their weapons in Belfast's bars and restaurants, as well as letting off rounds with the fury and intensity of a Mafia film, and culminating in the armour-plated car resplendent in red of HM Post Office! However, the best (worst) example is the town of Crossmaheart, a curious euphemism for Crossmaglen. Presumably changed as to not offend residents of the town, since it is described with venom by Starkey as being a tough Republican stronghold. But as Starkey narrates his description of the particularly nasty IRA rang that run the town, we are treated to a panorama of the main street, radiant with the freshly-painted red, white and blue kerbstones!(Loyalist colours)This film does cannot decide whether it is comical or serious drama. The ridiculousness of the terrorist groups is accentuated by the length of the film, over two hours, and one is left cringing as the plot plods on towards its inevitable end. One must admire an attempt to portray Ulster in its recent light on film, but it is very dangerous to develop humorous characatures of terrorists, particularly pertinent as the films scheduled October release coincided with the sensitive issue of prisoner release.

Thankfully, the pic is also not a hatchet job on Britain (as pics usually are 'cos everyone is scared of the IRA, including me).  Instead, it is even-handed, and lampoons sectarians on both sides.

It is more of a black comedy. Gun-toting nuns in Minis ?The first half of the film was really tedious, especially the scenes at the party. The second half started to get more interesting, if a bit bizarre. The title became obvious so early in the film that it was something of an anti-climax when he finally worked it out for himself.Don't waste your money on this film - there's bound to be something better on.

Billed as a comedy, it turns out to be more of a thriller as we follow down on his luck (and alcoholic) reporter Dan Starkey (David Thewlis - Dragonheart) as he bumbles his way through being convicted of murder, chased by the IRA and the Police while he tries to unravel a conspiracy involving high and mighty politicians trying to make peace in troubled Northern Ireland. Moderately entertaining, it falls down mainly because you will not care less what happens to any of the very dislikable characters involved in the plot and if you really think about it the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Best part of the film is the gorgeous Laura Fraser as Thewlis' &#145;bit on the side', although she is not in it all that much.

It was mind blowingly painful to watch. For a supposed black comedey, it was utterly lacking in comedy, makming it more of a very poorly executed political thriller with badly-staged shoot-outs. The main character is utterly unlovable in every way, and you begin to wish that the IRA would just rub him out and save us the agony of having to put up with him. The rest of the cast go from unconvincing (A stripper nun) to stupidly pointless (A group od inept IRA hitmen) to one-dimensional (Our hero's long suffering wife who he trieats like crap and expects to be loved for it. Oh, the sotry? It doesn't show up till half way through the film, and then we're force-fed it by having one of the characters vomit expostion at the scrteen.The highlights? A see-through bra in the first ten-minutes.

Let others see the film and make up their own minds.  Who knows, some might even like it.  Chacun a son gout.But this waste product is so puffed in its own conceit it begs me to comment.  It is the worst movie/DVD experience of my life.  I was trapped by company or I would have walked out-- of my own house!  It purports to be a comedy.  It is not funny.  It purports to be a commentary on the turmoil of Northern Ireland.  It is nothing more than the typical cheapjack cynicism the British pass off as political insight.  It purports to star David Thewlis.  Unfortunately it does. The premise of this movie is so painfully weak that it falls apart like wet toilet paper even to describe it.  Let us just say that someone with a high school equivalency degree will guess the significance of the phrase divorcing jack long before the Thewlis character does-- and that the tedium of waiting for Thewlis's character to catch up is not enlivened by a succession of ridiculous characters such as the nun imposter (oh, haha, heehee), the unbelievable Boston Globe reporter or the overdrawn IRA gunman (Jason Isaacs, who should choose his roles better.) What really keynotes this as a bad movie for me is that the discovery of what the Big Secret is, the rationale behind all these deaths, takes place OFF SCREEN-- and then someone has to sit down in another scene and painfully tell Thewlis all about it. An anticlimax to an anticlimax, and so typical of the incompetence of this director!   "},{"Title":"Slick but overhyped and overcooked satire on Northern Ireland","Date":"26 June 2000","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Thriller, Comedy","Review":"  Easily the most hyped film ever made in Northern Ireland, 'Divorcing Jack' falls very short of expectations. Billed as a refreshing satire on the petty bigotries that dominate Northern Irish life and the attempt by some to gloss over them, this is pretty heavy handed stuff.Desperately trying to be as hip as Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting,' David Caffrey's film lacks bite. David Thewlis, an accomplished actor, is totally at sea in the lead role - his accent is all over the place - as are other quality actors like Robert Lindsay and Jason Isaacs. The journalist anti-hero is the same old stereotype of the hard drinking, womanising hack we have grown tired of seeing onscreen and bears no reality to the real life models.The difference between the anti-hero here and the anti-hero, Boyle in Oliver Stone's brilliant 'Salvador' is the latter is still human. James Woods' character in 'Salvador' is believable. David Thewlis's character is merely a cartoon sketch by comparison.And at least Stone's film has some things to say about American involvement in Central America and the relationship between journalists and their sources. 'Divorcing Jack,' by way of contrast, has practically nothing to say. It can only offer feeble humour about the political stereotypes in the province - loyalist hard men, republican hard men and new model Irish republicans. What's all the more appalling is the smug way it tries to pass off this shoddy humour.The one bright spark in the film is Rachel Griffith's performance. But all in all, this is pretty dismal stuff. Here's hoping 'Wild About Harry' is much, much better! "}]
