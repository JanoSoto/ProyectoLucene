One such example is when the boys first meet their native american uncle, and are illuminated to the ecological problems in our consumer specific culture.  Not since Fire Down Below, has their plight been so real that you cannot ignore it, and must hold yourself to blame.  Another prime example is when Tum Tum runs afoul of the Yakuza, and his brothers steadfast protection of him in the face of danger.  A bold, artistic statement, Three Ninjas Knuckle Up gives up the way of punches and kicks, and chooses the love of family over blitzkreig martial arts shenanigans in what is the most refreshing film of the year, and a prime candidate for film preservation.  (All things said, I must admit that my review may be a little biased, being that I played Ninja who gets hit in the crotch #3, so I hope you'll bear with me) "},{"Title":"The best of the series its a really good film for kids and adults may enjoy too","Date":"5 January 2010","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Action, Family","Review":" I just watched all three of these movies and I couldn't recommend the first two to anyone really. The first one might be enjoyed by some kids but the second was awful.This film was shot a year after part one with the same cast and it was held up in post production and a third film was made but the third film made was actually released second. The kids in this film came back two years later and did some re-shoots and additional scenes and the boy who played Rocky actually has braces and is much taller as is the kid playing Colt.This movie isn't flawless by any means it has a very high cheese level to it, a lot of over acting and silly gags aimed at kids. The movie got a PG-13 rating because it had lots more ninja action and a few somewhat adult language bombs dropped, but nothing a kid couldn't watch. I can't imagine older kids enjoying it, but young kids would eat it up.As an adult I compared it to a Steven Seagal movie for kids with a touch of old Dukes of Hazard episodes thrown in. It had some great actors doing some not so great roles but it was fun to watch. Donal Logue was funny as one of the bad guys and Charles Napier is great in anything and makes a wonderful bad guy.The plot here was different and actually had a message which is good. It is a movie about bad guys dumping hazardous materials on an Indian reservation and the kids go in and try to put a stop to it.Fun film - I think if you like kids movies you should enjoy this one, look over flaws and goofs and cheesiness and just watch it.The worst thing about this movie was the way the kids yelled A-YAA every time they kicked or hit someone.

The characteristic is funny,since in this way,too-young kids can be introduced to classical martial arts movie plots. One of the first problems is that there is no official final boss, unlike in the previous 3 ninjas movies, making audiences feeling like something is missing. O once again, the plot is not original, but that was never meant to be the final goal. And probably, this is what makes the film not completely enjoyable by older audiences. Despite the plot, however, the fight choreographs are the most amazing in the series, but sometimes they get unnecessarily acrobatic(like the brawl in the Indian village). The fight with the motor bikers resembles, at first, the warehouse fight scene with Bruce lee's Lookalike in GAME OF DEATH, but then it evolves and amazingly becomes something like a copy of the chase from ALTRIMENTI CI ARRABBIAMO(WATCH OUT, WE'RE MAD!)with Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, which is quite enjoyable. Another funny scene is the fight in the abandoned bar, in which Rocky and Tum Tum change their fighing styles according to the goofy changes of music coming from a nearby jukebox. Unfortunateley, this scene is too similar to the fight scene from PIU FORTE RAGAZZI(ALL THE WAY BOYS), again with Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. The booby traps prepared by the kids are always a trademark of the series, but once again, the concept is not original. So almost nothing in this movie is original, but since is a movie meant for kids, it probably could not have been done better. Younger kids would enjoy this movie, but older ones would be bored they will probably enjoy themselves more watching a traditional martial arts movie starring Jackie Chan. And in the end, this episode was the perfect way to end the series, since the final message concerns most of the main character's personality. However, somebody decided to make another sequel in 1998...

As they were heading up, they see a group of protesters at a landfill. The protesters were Native Americans protesting Jack Harding for dumping garbage and hazardous chemicals on their land. Jack Harding was a cruel man and ignored the land owner's protests and continued his dumping. His men kidnapped Charlie who had evidence of Harding's illegal dumpings! Later, Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum go to the pizza parlor while Grandpa does some shopping. Charlie's daughter, Jo, was in there questioning some rednecks who work for Harding. The leader, J.J., began giving her a hard time. Colt and Tum Tum come to her rescue and so begins a Ninjitsu action battle. Soon the bad guys give up but when Grandpa finds out what has been going on, he is most displeased. Back at the cabin, he taught them the correct ways of the Ninja which involved listening to the flowers bloom. The next day, the boys help clean up the pizza parlor and meet up with Jo who tells them what happened with her father and they agree to help.       Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum tail J.J. and the men to Harding's sanitation department and find Charlie all tied up. They fight some guards on the way out and make a plan to go back and rescue Charlie that night. So while Grandpa sleeps, Rocky, Colt, Tum Tum and Jo go to rescue Charlie and they are successful. He still has the evidence with him a computer disk that has the read outs of the chemicals on it. Harding's men tried to stop them, but the boys Ninja-kicked the daylights out of them. At the Indian village, the boys were commended for their efforts. But soon Harding and his men arrived to cause trouble but the boys managed to give them a work out. Grandpa was there too! Harding and J.J. retreated, vowing revenge. Soon came the day of Charlie's hearing. Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum go along. All the while, Colt was feelings for Jo which he tries not to show. En route to the courthouse, a biker gang on Harding's payroll causes trouble. They gas Jo's mother so Rocky takes the wheel but the only driving experience he's is at the video arcade so they drive off road and on but with luck they ditch the bikers into a ghost town and give the martial arts battle of their lives to some bumbling bikers and thugs.         Harding's men had kidnapped Jo and Harding blackmailed Charlie in court so he couldn't show them the disk. Luckily, Rocky, Colt and Tum Tum had rescued Jo. They beat up the bad guys, jump in the car and bounce to the courthouse. They play the disk and Harding's foul play is at an end. The landfill was permanently shut down and Harding was sent to jail so all was well. What's more, Rocky finally learned what it meant to listen to the flowers. They don't want to show off their beauty, they just are beautiful.        Not a bad addition to the 3 Ninjas saga. This is actually Part 2 even though it was released as Part 3. There must be some story behind that because in 3 Ninjas Kick Back the kids look older where as in this movie they're the same ages as in the original. Victor Wong, who sadly is no longer with us, returns as Grandpa; This 3 Ninjas movie has alot more action and violence which is probably why it's rated PG-13. There was a fourth 3 Ninjas movie 3 Ninjas High Noon at Mega Mountain. That film was awful!! Terrible! It was so bad I won't even do a review for it. It isn't worthy of one, but 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up was pretty good. I recommend it.

Knuckle Up is definitely the most action packed, the focus hardly on the story and more on flashy, Jackie Chan-like fight scenes. It's pretty unbelievable, how these pre-teen kids beat the snot out of full-grown armed men. In one scene, the bad guys have shotguns and they really hate those kids, but instead of shooting them, they prefer using the guns as clubs and try to whack them, but of course their plan fails.The ninjas execute a number of impressive martial arts moves on their hapless foes, and even some unnecessary fake-outs just for show. This movie is good for a laugh, watch it if you like slap-stick humor and kids beating up wave after wave of foolish henchmen.

With a dragging, almost non-existent plot, the movie relied on a barrage of unnecessary fight scenes, and the longest, most pointless chase scene ever. I finally turned off the movie when I watched a scene where Rocky is fighting some thugs. But it wasn't the child actor, it was an adult stunt double crouching to look smaller, doing all these complicated spins and kicks.

If you listen to most of these people who have bashed it, they loved it as kids. Your kids probably don't care and wouldn't know the difference. All of the 3 Ninjas films are enjoyable! Most of my friends think I'm too old to still like it. I'm 14 and I've watched them since I was five! They give you just the right amount of humor and action, it'd be hard not to like it. Most of kids films are depicted as being corny, the 3 Ninjas ones are pretty educational, this one was about pollution (which is an important thing you'd like to learn about). Besides that, the movie was made on a low budget. The stunt people were hard to look like actually 12 year olds! I was really happy to see the original three come back.The dancing scene is corny but I bet everyone tried to learn it after they watched it! The grandpa getting bathed by the boys is a little disturbing but at least its only a few minutes long. 3 Ninjas Knuckle Up may be poorly written or REALLY crapply made but if you look past it, its really much better than it seems.I lost interest in it when I was about 8 and I started liking barbies but just recently I picked one up from my library and watched it and I really like 3 Ninjas again!

They are protesting against a local businessman dumping toxic waste on their land but, with the protest being violently dispersed by police and thugs, the boys head into town to get pizza. However when those same thugs start picking on people in the local pizzeria, the boys fight back and with new friend (and cutie) Jo, get drawn into the fight against the battle for right.Despite the fact that I had watched the p1ss-poor final film in the 3 Ninjas film series I found myself watching this one to see if there had ever been any merit in the series. Plus, to be honest, I did have a bit of a childish laugh about the fact that the title seemed to be suggesting that the boys would be entering puberty and perhaps be discovering the weird sensation of self-love for the first time (well, what else does the verb to knuckle up mean to you?). Anyway this comedy aside, there is not a great deal of value within the film other than that which comes unintentionally. The plot is obvious of course but the delivery tries to be in the style of a live action cartoon. This approach at times makes for some amusing moments but mostly it falls flat because the material is not that good and the comedy is obvious and rather lacking invention or wit.One can imagine it working for young children but, speaking as someone who used to run a Sunday school class for 3-4 year olds, I have to ask whether or not I would want my kids watching this sort of material; the answer is probably no. The action is silly and mostly fits in with the very obvious pratfalls that one would find in very basic silent comedy or children's television. I didn't find it exciting or funny and you can just feel the lack of heart or caring in the delivery. Indeed this is all through the film as it looks very cheap and is delivered with the minimum of effort. The direction is obvious and we get lots of comedy sound effects throughout as if to tell us to laugh.The cast is different from the film I say but they are no better. They can move and there is no doubt that they are agile but that is very different from being able to act, which they can't. Treanor, Slade and Power cannot deliver a line for toffee and even during the action I found their constant hi-yah's to be endlessly annoying. Looking at them on IMDb I note with no surprise that few have viable careers now. Lightening plays the love interest and is no better than them &#150; and IMDb puts a recent credit in her career as Scantily Clad Girl #2 which perhaps suggests that she has gotten no better with time. Napier hams it up but looks like Olivier when compared to the lacklustre Kilpatrick. Wong is badly served and not helped by the most obvious use of a stunt body I've seen since the Family Guy movie spoofed Stewie jumping through a window.Overall then, those looking for entertainment will do best to chuckle about the suggested meaning in the rubbish title but not bother to check the movie out itself. The acting, direction, action and overall delivery is roundly poor and, although the odd bit here and there is amusing, there is little here that I would want my children to take as their entertainment.

I (In moment of writing) haven't checked out whether the director or the rest of the staff has done any other movies, for good or for worse after this one, but I sure hope they read the feedback from us users, and think from another perspective after that.Anyway, to end thisThis movie could have had some potential if the plot had been a bit different, how I don't know, but at least the 'bad/dumb- guys' could have been given a little more brain (Instantly thinking of J.J (Patrick Kilpatrick) when Jack (Charles Napier) orders him to get on the horn for the goons (Or soon to be), and what does the birdbrain do? Well, go figure, he honks the horn!!? One word in one sentence -Duh!Well, enough from me, let's hear from you...

Hearing some loser 5 year old kid yell Lets murderize em! will probably irritate you so much that you will destroy some furniture at least. God knows what you may do to that kid and the other loser actors in this sickening piece of horse dung movie, if you ever get to meet them in real life. If you see this on TV, you will certainly blow up the screen. With horrible acting, a horrible plot, horrible direction, horrible screenplay, horrible screenplay and the most annoying characters ever conceivable by the screwed up human mind, this is one movie to avoid at any costs. Listen to me and you'll save some property.

Once in a while, we get AMAZING movies like The Empire Strikes Back and Godfather II. However, comparing this movie to those two classics would be a great injustice to Mr. Lucas and Mr. Coppola.I saw the first one as a nine-year old kid, and perhaps seeing this one eight years later detracted from me taking interest in the film, but nonetheless - this film is bad.Eighty-five minutes of non-stop ninja action (they're not exaggerating when they say that) put together to form a weak plot. The Bruce Lee movies (which I am not really a fan of) at least have a sense of class in the way they show the martial arts as, well . . . an art! This is just pure violence. The film is obviously meant to be a flick for teenage girls with overactive hormones to come drool over Treanor and Slade (now 16 and 15 in this movie I believe) as they kick the living daylights out of everyone they meet.This movie isn't entirely bad. The plot does try to tie in some interesting topics about Native American culture, however, the inaccuracies and stereotypical portrayal of the culture detracts from admiring this aspect of the movie too. Another good aspect is that I guess the moral of the story is humility, but it's hard to pick that up with all the bad motorbike guys flying all over the place, getting their butts kicked by some five foot ninja.In the end, this is an incoherent, trashy, unwatchable film that plays at a much lower level than the original. Perhaps now that I'm 17 I should watch the original again and wonder why I liked it in the first place. Perhaps it was learning the lessons of obedience, patience, and of course getting a good laugh or two out of it. But nonetheless, this is not a trilogy worthy of sitting next to the Star Wars, Godfather or even the Ninja Turtles Trilogy for that matter!Best of luck to Treanor, Slade and Power. I do hope that they may land roles in the future that don't require them to jump up in the air, make a 360, and kick a massive biker guy (who weighs at least 200 pounds heavier than them) in the face and knock him out cold.3 out of 10 . . . The last time I went that low was Starship Troopers (it got a 1)! Yikes!!

Unlike the other 3 NINJAS, this one does a good job making us really like the characters. I had a hard time liking the characters in the other 3 NINJAS movies. They just seem less annoying in this movie. I liked the fact that this one had a lot more action in it than the other 3 NINJAS movies. In this one, the action is almost non-stop. I got kind of bored during the other 3 NINJAS movies, but during this one I never got bored. It had loads of humor which I loved. I also found the slapstick a lot more tolerable than I did in the other 3 NINJAS movies. I loved this movie. My only complaint about the movie is that it didn't have enough plot. If there was a little more plot in the movie then it would've been perfect. As it is, I look forward to buying this movie and I hope that a DVD version of the movie is released soon.

Many of them are from older, 'wiser' guys who snicker at the sight of seeing teen and preteen boys kick the livin daylights outta grown men with bats. Well, check your egos at the door because the beauty of martial arts is that size doesn't matter, if you can believe it.  And neither does age.  This movie also provides a glimpse into Native American culture which is much appreciated since they aren't represented much in Hollywood.I'd take Mike Treanor (Rocky), Max Elliot Slade (Colt), and Chad Power (Tum Tum) over Schwartzeneggar, Van Damme and the lot of Hollywood martial arts/action hero actors any day.  At least these kids are funny.

I didn't know how bad. It's probably the worst of the THREE NINJAS series (or, as it's spelled to market towards the under-age demographic, 3 NINJAS!), and that's not an easy feat. It starts poorly, and it just goes downhill. Every fight scene is so bad, it's not even explainable. (Is that a word?)I've seen some bad films in my day but this is one of the worst, ever. I'm not exaggerating. In one fight scene, a kid actor -- who, coincidentally, can't act -- kicks a guy. He bends over with a comical look on his face, as if he's saying Ouch! That hurt! I wonder why! I better think about it and give this kid the opportunity to do it again in the meantime!, and then the kid hands him a pizza tray (don't ask), punches him again, then kicks him. The guy pushes himself backwards and does a double flip (poor stuntmen -- it's obvious they're using their own force to accomplish the task), then lands on a table.It's like POWER RANGERS, only performed by kids. In very dangerous situations, mind you. E.g. at the end a bunch of ruthless crooks with guns are chasing the kids and they keep outrunning and punching them.This is a bad idea to put in kids' minds. You can beat up grownups with guns -- just throw a few punches!Let me tell you what really would have happened.Crook No. 1 would have whipped out his Uzi and taken down all three kids as they were running down the street like hyperactive morons.I can't even DESCRIBE the awfulness of this movie. You honestly have to see it for yourself. It's that bad.It's almost as bad as POD PEOPLE.And get this Rated PG-13 for non-stop ninja action.Non-stop ninja action. Wow. I guess this movie IS responsible for one thing -- proving that the MPAA can even manage to poke fun at movies. For non-stop ninja action. I'm still laughing over that one.-1/5  "}]
