The music is a central focus of the film, but not as a compromise to the story of a town in turmoil. Coal mines being shut down in the name of progress puts many men out of work which naturally also jeopardizes the existence of the colliery band. The music combined with brilliant storytelling (and editing) is merely a platform for some superb acting, particularly from Pete Postlethwaite.Having lived all my life in a large metropolitan city, I cannot relate first hand to the plight of a small town community. Despite that, I found the story intriguing even though it may seem the outcome is somewhat predictable.Having just purchased the DVD, I found the brief write-up on the box to be way off the mark. It touts this film as some kind of romantic and hilarious comedy, never once even grazing past the real subject matter of the film. This is another perfect example of the continued miscalculated promotion of a truly well crafted film that Muriel's Wedding also fell victim to. I'm not sure what the promoters were thinking, but if you set someone up for a hilarious romantic comedy and what they receive is a thoughtful serious and sometimes depressing film, are they going to be happy just the same? There are graciously some light moments and humourous turns in this otherwise sombre subject matter, but this film doesn't have a happy ending. But it sure does have a moving one. Postlethwaite's performance hits you in an unexpected way and you'd have to have a heart of stone to not be moved by it.Any success that the film enjoys now that's it's strictly on video, is likely to come from very strong word of mouth. I had been told how good it was and enjoyed it immensely. Now that I've seen it twice, and thus been twice moved, I wait for a reasonable time to pass so that I may watch and enjoy it again as I am bound to do.

How anyone can call it a comedy is beyond me.  Yes there are some laughs, but there are far more tears; some of pain, some of joy.  This is a drama with a sense of humor.  You have to keep a sense of humor to survive when life kicks you in the gut.I've read some reviews condemning the politics of this film.  Well, I applaud the political message.  I grew up near an industrial town; one centered on the auto industry, heavy machinery, and agri-business.  As I got older, I watched it disintegrate, through the 70's and 80's, as the grain embargo, auto industry woes and recession bled the life out of the town. It has never recovered.  Many of us felt that Reagan and Thatcher, and their descendants, were monsters who sold their people out for a quick buck; while the parties that were supposed to represent the workers and middle class joined in the takings.  To us, this isn't an anti-Thatcher film; it's the truth.The performances of this film, particularly Pete Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson, as well as Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald are top notch.  There is a sweet and painful romance here; but it is the community of the miners, through the life of the band, that is the center here. The music is beautiful and will move you.  The piece played as the pit closure is finalized stirs so many emotions. The rendition of Danny Boy brings tears to your eyes.  The review in our local alternative paper said the surprise near the end would reduce even the hardest heart to tears, and they were right.There is so much to see and love about this film, regardless of your political beliefs.  Music does matter, but the people who create it matter, too.  Communities matter, love matters.  This is what good filmmaking is all about.  See this film.  You'll laugh a bit, cry a lot, get angry, become sad; but, you'll never be bored.

I cannot think of two more powerful performances committed to celluloid than those of Peter Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. There is so much emotion in Brassed Off that anyone who fails to be moved must have a heart of stone...if indeed they have a heart at all. People I know (or reviews I have read) that didn't like the film have criticised the intense political messages within it, but in my opinion these folk are missing the point entirely. It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now. My point is this Brassed Off is a very humane picture that paints a picture of early eighties folk who have been robbed of their livelihood, yet still manages to be funny, charming, heartwarming, heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. A truly wonderful film.

A film which did not seek to glamourise the effect of long term unemployment and the break up of communities. And a film which WAS based very closely on a true story. The band members you see actually playing the music? That's the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, winners of the national Battle of the Bands competition in the year that the colliery closed down. And they did turn professional too!Films like Brassed Off, which seek to present a view of a sensitive issue, are often derided for not offering a solution which can be written on the back of a cereal box. Personally, I take that as a recommendation!The point of the film is this put people in situations that most of us will happily never face, and they react in extreme fashions. There was little or no 'political' argument, other than the fact that the Conservative Government of the time did destroy an entire industry. That same government them spent millions of pounds a year buying coal from Europe and South America. Angry? I would be.I saw characters portrayed in their entirety, which meant 'scabs' and 'sellouts' rubbed shoulders with the committed and poor. I saw unflattering portraits of basically decent people, prepared to risk friendships and relationships to keep alive an industry which was killing them but without which they could not live. It was a desperate time, and the fact that families have been split since the 1984 strike shows just how deep feelings can run on this issue.And I saw no skipping over the holes in the logic either. No mention of the 4-1 vote in favour of closing the mine? Half of the chuffing film was about that! What about the fate of Gloria's report? What about Phil, a striker from 1984, voting for closure? Did no-one notice that he was one of the major characters?I do think that there were some problems with the structure of the film (although it was dramatically more satisfying than the Full Monty). Gloria was unconvincing; the wives were underused, and the speech at the end, yes, I found it embarrassing too!But please, before you attack the veracity of such a rounded and honest film as Brassed Off, take the time and trouble to watch it properly first!

There are certain moments that stick out to me as either breath taking or harrowing.1) That famous 'Concierto d'Aranguez' scene. The first time I saw this scene it took my breath away, literally. When used well music can move you in a way words can't. The juxtaposing of this piece of music against the union's meeting is one of them. I haven't been this moved by a piece of music with actions since then apart from the Roxan sequence in Moulin Rouge.2) The scene where Phil loses it when playing Mr Chuckles I actually can't sit through. I have to fast forward because the emotion the Stephen Tompkinson manages to portray is so strong it's painful to watch.Through all of this though I think my favorite scene, the aforementioned 1) excluded, is when they compete in all 14 tournaments and get completely rat arsed. The sight of these brilliant musicians trying to continue playing when they can't see straight, stop laughing, or keep their instruments in one piece is one of the most honest, amusing and humble moments in a film in recent years. there is no flashy camera work, no deeper meaning, just something that says exactly who these people are. Ordinary human beings, not super-heros, and just trying to live life whilst having fun in difficult circumstances. And you really can't play wind instruments drunk, I've tried.The film is not perfect. It is a bit preachy, especially the end. And McGregor's accent, although he plays the part beautifully, does slip at time, especially in his longer speeches. But the humanity of the film and it's charm out way all of it's faults.

I even read one which announced keep politics out of my entertainment!!! Sorry, but the story is based around real events & the politics of the miners & the times are an integral part of that story. One poster (from Scotland who should have known better) stated  I think the problem I have is this film really plays up to the clichéd northern stereotypes it's almost offensive , the male characters all work down the pit , play in a brass band etc that it's impossible to believe in them as real human beings. It was a colliery band - of course all the male band members worked down the pit - that was the crux of the story. And why does working down a pit & playing in a brass band diminish you as a real human being?According to a poster from Yorkshire, who lived through the pit closures, it was VERY true to the times. Mr Scotland is being a bit elitist I think. I'm an Australian who cringes (&, if comedy, laughs) at the depiction of the stereotypical Aussie (think Kath & Kim if you get it over there) but that's only because I'm not one. However, the country's filled with them!! It was a magnificent & moving film which captured the essence of the Thatcher years of destruction. If your not familiar with the period then do yourself a favour & read a bit about the history behind the pit closures etc before you watch this film - you'll enjoy it a whole lot more. For you fellow Greenies out there, yes, I agree coal mining must cease but you don't go and pull the safety net away from a community without having something else to take its place. BTW. the closures didn't lower the use of fossil fuels anyway - the UK just started to import coal instead.

This being drama of course the path to victory isn't a smooth one - there is bankruptcy, illness, broken marriages, and a clash with the new executive power (represented by Tara Fitzgerald, also taking a place in the band for her father).  Romantic interest for Tara is present in cute Ewan McGregor - an unusually quiet role for him.Say what you like about the way this film portrays the North of England, there is no denying the power of the final sequences as the triumph of 'William Tell' turns into Postlethwaite's power rant against the Government and into the trip home's 'Land of Hope and Bloody Glory'.

The coal miners in Brassed Off thought so too, but found redundancy not what it was cracked up to be. At the start, pits are closing all over Britain, but the Grimley colliery in South Yorkshire is still open and making a profit. After a hard day's dirty work down the mine there's nought like a session with the band to blow out the dust. Let by total obsessive bandleader Danny (Peter Postlewaithe) the boys play a surprising range - Rodrigo's Aranjuez (we call it orange juice says Danny), Rossini's William Tell overture and lots of Elgar and other English sentimental favourites - Jerusalem, Danny Boy, Colonel Bogey and All Things Bright and Beautiful.Though possible closure is on the horizon, things are fairly cozy until pretty young Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald) walks in with a vintage obbligato cornet and asks to join. She's a woman (shock, horror!) but granddaughter of a former member and after a demonstration of her musical prowess is allowed in. Brooding young Andy (Ewan McGregor, unforgettable in Trainspotting) has kissed the young lady years previously and falls for her again.The band have their problems, especially Phil (Stephen Tompkinson) son of Danny the leader. Phil has an unfortunate gambling habit that keeps him broke and his family on the financial edge. In the background the future of the mine is becoming bleaker.In the meantime Danny, who is developing a very bad cough, decides the band can make the national championships at the Albert Hall, and despite bailiffs, mendacious mine management, feral hospital matrons and British weather they get there.This film in many ways is an update of the fine, well crafted Ealing comedy of the 1950s, celebrating the triumph of ordinary people over adverse circumstances, officialdom and middle class pretentiousness, through their own determination and talent. For the 90s the comedy has a harder edge and the political element more overt. At the end we are reminded of the hundreds of pits closed and 250,000 jobs lost in Britain between 1984 (the year of the great miners' strike) and 1994. But surely the filmmakers are not arguing the miners should still be down below. Global warming alone means coal has had its day. The real crime was the failure to invest in alternative employment and to allow the destruction of the communities which had grown up around the mines. The British State, which owned the mines for 40 years after World War Two, proved a harsher master than the old private owners, especially when the Bad Baroness herself, Margaret Thatcher, decided to sell.On the strength of their performance here, the (mythical) Grimley band could easily turn professional, like the similarly displaced workers in The Full Monty. Unlike The Full Monty the Brassed Off crowd don't step outside their mind-set - they are still chained to their working class attitudes and the future looks like happening without them. They escape from the working class to the underclass, clutching a year's salary most of them will soon be parted from. The traditional happy ending of the Ealing comedy is here only symbolic. Still, the miners' spirit shines through and you can't help admiring their grit. And the music's nice.

Giving much relief to a very depressed area, the band are hoping to make the grand finals day at the Royal Albert Hall, could the arrival of Flugelhorn player, Gloria, be just what the band needs? Or is she merely the catalyst to something far more critical?Brassed Off is the first of what I personally call the Magical British Trio, three films that perfectly portray the British sense of humour during dark depressing times of unemployment. The other two of course are The Full Monty (1997) and Billy Elliot (2000), of which Brassed Off is essentially an appetiser of sorts, the warm up act for the big hitters so to speak. Not to say that Brassed Off is not worthy to sit alongside those well received pictures (home and abroad as they say), it most certainly is, it's just that its blend of humour and strife doesn't find any easy ground, thus making it hard for the undiscerning viewer to be at ease at the right moments. It is in short, unsure of what it primarily wants to be. The humour does work well tho, but it's in the dramatic core of the miners strikes, and the affects they have on the denizens of this quaint colliery town, that Brassed Off truly works, with some scenes literally tugging away at the old heart strings. Then there be the music itself, The Grimethorpe Colliery Band on whose real life story this film is based provide the music for the soundtrack, and its most enjoyable, often stirring, and definitely poignant at crucial moments.The cast are tremendous, Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald offer up splendid youthful heart, but they are playing second fiddle (or should that be third brass section?) to Pete Postlethwaite and Stephen Tompkinson. As father and son, Postlethwaite and Tompkinson give the film its deep emotional being, each driven by differing needs, Brassed Off's success rests with both men being able to hold the viewers attention from the get go. Tompkinson has made a very profitable and thriving career in British Television, and rightly so, but it remains criminal that he didn't go on and make more well known and profitable full length feature films after his fabulous turn here. Filmed in the ideal Northern English town of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, Brassed Off is a film that has evident problems, but to someone like me, a Brit who lived thru those depressing days under Margaret Thatcher's government, it's a film that I love for a myriad of reasons, one can only hope that one of those reasons strikes a chord with yourselves.A completely biased 9/10 from me!

Set some years after the 1984 - 1985 miners' strike that brought the National Union of Mineworkers to its knees and Thatcher's Conservative Government to implement new laws to prevent miners from travelling in convoy to assist other coal pits. This was butchery of human liberties' and the hearts and minds of this once great mining tradition throughout England and Wales. Rumours of MI5 infiltration via spies, phone tapping's and its anti subversive and heavy handed State Police style tactics and the new laws formed by then Tory party that prevented striking miners any State Benefits that lead many families into vast amounts of debt. This only succeeded in the English coal mining communities to further dig their heels in and fight for their jobs, their rights and their families. One only has to see the opening sequence to the true story of the 2000 movie Billy Elliot, that set against the 1984 strike itself, to get a taste of the extreme harsh dictatorship and demoralising positions the miners were placed under.The year is now 1992, and we now see the aftermath of the last eight years and how this particular mining community has adapted to its changing climate of crumbling poverty and hollow existence. Now the threat of closure has finally caught up with them and they too must make a stance to regain any dignity they have left. With pickets and their rallying calls of Miners united will never be defeated, the harsh facts are more relevant in 1992 as it was back in the mid '80's.Brassed Off centres on the future of the Grimethorpe (Grimley) Colliery Brass Band and its bandmaster Danny (Pete Postlethwaite) ambition to reach the finals of the National Brass Band competition. While walking on eggshells his is a story of pride and bitter resentment that he just might be the last of his kind. The fabric of the band is interwoven within the collieries future, one cannot exist without the other, Danny's refusal to give in, to accept this fate is more than commendable to his ever-increasing worries of ill heath, family concerns and dashed and missed hopes. This is a movie of civic pride, the battered, bruised, withered and imploded egos, the cold unforgiving nagging of the pressures of older men beaten down by the new age of Privatisation and globalisation and the younger men who too are falling victim to this new giant of corporate sell-outs'. There after, to add insult to injury Grimethorpe, via a 1994 E.U. enquiry into poverty, had become of the poorest and destitute towns in both England and the European Union.Brassed Off shows just a very tiny tip of the poverty stricken district on this South Yorkshire village here, the debt collectors, Pawn Shops, picket lines, the feuding and divided relationships between men and their wives and their children and the struggle to make ends meet for the basics is at times harrowing to witness. This may be a fictional place but the times and actions are as true as the mines that have now become housing estates, parks or wastelands and sad reminders of a once thriving British industry, very much liken to the Steel industry of Sheffield, as seen in the 1997 movie The Full Monty.We see a young Ewan McGregor as Union member Andy, and his love interest with the pretty clerical worker Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald) making a nice metaphor for the dealings between management and the betrayed workforce, but in the end it was all about the music; these guys weren't just brassed off they were punched and kicked to the ground.During a radio interview with the actor Stephen Tompkinson (Phil) in early 2007, it was said that the movie showed the band winning the Trophy at the Royal Albert Hall some two weeks after the closure of the pit, but the reality was that they won it the day after the pit had closed its gates for the final time. This two-week time scale was added because the writers thought that the movies audience would seem this to be a little far-fetched and unbelievable. Mark Herman (b. East Yorkshire, 1954) has written and directed this fable of trouble and strive, if a little on the sentimental side, but rightly so, a hard-hitting realistic flashback of the times of a land of prosperity turned upside down and laid to waste and the terror of despair of a people that died a little with it.Where there's camaraderie there's always hope and always glory, even in this land of gold and brass.

For a long time, the brass band was the domain of men. Women weren't allowed to play in the bands and indeed, this is still the case today in two of the biggest names in the banding world.Underpinning all this is the fact that the film is (at least) semi-biographical. The events unfolding in the film mirror in no small way the same events which befell the Grimethorpe pit in 1992, and impacted on the world-famous Grimethorpe Colliery band. Thatcher's Britain did result in the pit closing down, and threatened the band's future. The band did take the stage at the National Final, and so the reason that the band don't turn professional is because there is no room in the banding movement for a professional band.For a point of information, there are 4 basses in a Brass Band, 2 Eb and 2 Bb (not 2 or 3). Oh yes, and bandsmen most certainly do carry there instruments through the street without a case, especially bass players.On a slightly different point, Phil does not have a gambling habit.

It's about a group of miners in a small Yorkshire town who are also members of a brass band. However, the mine is to be closed down, and the film shows what happens to the redundant workers afterwards. There is also a romance between Andy Barrow and Gloria, a woman who works for the management of the mine, which causes conflict in the group.Many scenes made me cry like a little child. One of these was the 'Danny Boy' scene outside the hospital window. Another was the scene where Stephen Tompkinson (one of the most under-rated actors working, in my opinion) dressed as a clown, is entertaining a group of children at the local church and loses it, completely, because he's so preoccupied with the thought of his sick father. The Albert Hall scene at the end is very emotional and enjoyable, and one of the highlights of this beautiful film. Sadly, many of the actors in it are still unrecognised as truly brilliant. Ewan McGregor lights up the screen in a pre-trainspotting role, however, but whatever happened to his love interest in the film, Tara Fitzgerald?

For even he did not predict the final number of pits that the Thatcherite government would evidentially close.The film is to many a landmark in British movie standards. To pigeon hole this film as a comedy - musical - political dialogue - does not do the film justice.If ever a film ticked all the boxes, this is the one.So sit back and watch a true cinematic epic! And the music (from a heavy metal fan at heart) is fantastic beyond all proportions.If you don't feel overwhelmed by William Tell or if Danny Boy doesn't bring a tear to your eye - then you may as well give up, as the message and the meaning of this film (that the only really important things in life are what you have always taken for granted) are probably why you never understood films such as Kes.

The closures killed the coal industry in England and forced many miners out of their jobs. Brassed off is a British slang expression that means dejected, fed up, upset, which is what the coal miners were when they were forced into retirement, into joblessness, and some even into suicide when the government closed the mines. Between 1990 and 1997, the party in control of the British government was the Conservatives, who were led by John Major, although the film calls them Tories or the Tory party. When the government decided to replace coal with nuclear power as a source of fuel, approximately 140 coal pits, representing more than 200,000 miners' jobs, were deemed redundant. The government offered the workers redundancy &#x96; forced retirement with severance pay. The film is set in Grimley, a fictitious town that represents the village of Grimethorpe in South Yorkshire, in the early 1990s. In the late 1970s, the European Union named Grimethorpe the poorest village in Britain. The village, however, is still fiercely proud of their brass band that has been in existence since 1881. The film has been criticized by some as a poor imitation of the Yorkshire dialect and accent, but most American audiences wouldn't know the difference. If you like brass band music, you'll enjoy Brassed Off and you'll learn some history about the British government closing the coal mines at the same time (something the U.S. may be forced to do in the not-too-distant future if the environmentalists have their way).

And it still does.Even now watching it again it is genuinely a funny, moving, and great experience. It is like watching a sports comedy but with brass bands. Yes, it is does wear its heart on its sleeve and it is both a comedy and a tearjerker; but it has a real soul, focusing on a colliery band and their lives by using comedy rather drama is a smart way to tell something of what happened to those 250,000 men (and their families) who lost their jobs in 140 pits across Britain. What makes Brassed Off great is that is does not scream, instead it uses real humour and light touches to make its point, and it is watchable because it's genuinely a good, moving film.With a good solid cast, including a young Ewan MacGregor and the excellent Pete Postlewaithe, solid directing, and more than a touch of northern rough humour, the films charms and disarms the viewer. Definitely worth viewing from a human drama, and comedic point of view it's fun, funny, moving, heartwarming; and reminds us that hope, dignity, and pride are still worth playing for.

They make themselves hard to take seriously by the way that all regional accents are overdone, and because of this - the acting always seems forced, and the drama trite. There are a few quality British productions, however - and Brassed Off is definitely one of them. I didn't see this film upon release, as it never appealed when I first heard of it, and then when The Full Monty was released; I had a feeling that this would turn out to be what it looks like; a less audacious version of said film. This is actually a better film than The Full Monty, as it does everything that did for the demise of the steel industry, but it's characters are much more defined and far easier to feel for; and as the characters are the most important element in a film like this, the success of the film can definitely be put down to the way that the characters have been written. The plot follows a group of people that work at an ill-fated coal mine. The mine is everything to these people, as it provides their livelihood; but for this group, the closure of the mine would also mean the end of their brass band.Brass bands aren't the most exciting thing I can think of, but the fact that it is a brass band and not, say, a football team at the centre of this film really helps it in it's bid for greatness. The brass band gives the film it's unique edge, and the way that the band comes together helps to give the film the element of sentiment that it needs, but not one so sickly that it brings the film down with it. In fact, this film's lack of sentiment is one of it's major assets too - so many films get bogged down in their own sentimentality, but this one avoids it, and makes you feel for the characters because of who they - not because you've been manipulated. The film is meant somewhat as a tribute to the amount of mines that have been closed in Great Britain, and yet still it never forces anything down your throat and, in true British style, Brassed Off looks at the tragedy of the mines closing in good humour and with a tough upper lip. This isn't an astounding piece of cinema, but everything about it comes together well - Brassed Off has characters you can feel for, some truly laugh out loud moments (one in a church springs to mind instantly) and an all round sense of goodwill. It's hard to really hate a film like this - so don't.

At the time it seemed like one of the last nails in the coffin of the outgoing Tory government.It's set in a real-looking Yorkshire mining town a few years after the 1984/85 miners strike, where the local coal mine is about to be closed. The miners (Ewan McGregor, Jim Carter, Stephen Tompkinson and others) find solidarity in their brass band under their conductor - retired miner Danny (the late Pete Postlewaite in his finest screen role), a man for whom music matters above all else. The pit closes, but the band makes it to the national brass band competition final at the Albert Hall. On winning, you expect Danny to make some sentimental speech about how - in spite of everything - music holds the band together. Instead, he delivers probably the explicit political diatribe against the then Conservative government and the devastation unemployment inflicts on people. It's a superb moment in a film with its heart and soul in the dying working class communities of Yorkshire. This isn't a piece of Ken Loach-like realism - it's prettified and sentimentalised for a mainstream audience, yet the movie looses nothing for it.At the close, the brass band play Elgar's Pomp and Circumstace March Number 1 as they pass the Houses of Parliament. It's meant to be ironic but it's also very touching.

Coming from the North of England and having survived the Thatcher years, the story of the pit closures is very familiar to me. The comments on this site about the closures being necessary surely miss the point. These men lived in small villages such as the fictional Grimley (actually based on Grimethorpe) and coal mining was the only industry available and despite this being an industry which destroyed their health, it was their life. These were men who had their entire lives taken away. For the record Thatcher was not a heroine (as she is regarded as in the USA). She all but destroyed my country and we are still living with the results of her policies all these years later. A final point about the accents, I know many Americans think us English either talk like the Queen or Dick Van Dyke but we all in fact have regional accents. I do know Yorkshire accents can be quite hard to understand (my accent is Lancashire) but it would be unrealistic to try to dumb it down, the accents are part of the film's charm, after all it is a British film.

I was surprised that a disproportionate share came from outside the US. I suppose it has gotten more play there.Many comments focus on the story of coal mines being closed because of many factors relating to other energy sources. Many also focus on it being a political issue (What isn't).From my point of view the displacement and plight of the coal miners is a touching and true story but altogether too familiar since the start of the industrial revolution. The current equivalent in the USA is the rampant outsourcing of technical jobs all over the world. On the other hand colliery brass bands (now very professional) is a very unique British phenomenon that this movie celebrates. That is what turns me on. It is quite a treat to have an entire movie revolve around a brass band. While the ending of the movie suggests that the band disbands (unintended word play), the Grimethorpe band who did the music still lives today.I agree with a comment that suggested the scene where Gloria joins the band and they play Rodrigo's Concerto is one of his favorite scenes. In fact, the reason I just watched that scene again for the 50th time is that I recently returned from a cruise that featured a classical guitarist as one of the entertainers. I was surprised that he played the same music in the scene. It did not seem right to me but then I discovered that Rodgrigo was one of the world's greatest guitarists and wrote this concerto for a guitar not a fluglehorn.The presence of Tara Fitzgerald at her prime and Ewan McGregor in a far different role from his superb performance in Moulin Rouge are extra bonuses as is the oft-mention acting skill of Pete Prostelwaithe.Still if you don't like Brass Bands, pass this by. The music is the real difference between this exceptional movie and the similar themed Full Monty, which I detested.

Determined to convince himself that if only the band can win the annual brass band festival in London the community will remain intact, the audience begins to see the cards stacking up against him &#150; while at the same time being drawn into his hypnotic, romantic belief.First the unlikely arrival of glamorous Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald) who is staying in only temporary accommodation. While pursuing her professional career.. she has kept up playing the Flugelhorn.. as an elegy to her late father.. another occupational casualty of the industry.For a moment, she breaks the spell that Danny has woven over his son Phil (Stephen Tompkinson) and workmates Andy (Ewan McGregor), Harry (Jim Carter), Jim (Philip Jackson) and Ernie (Peter Martin). But the reason for her return is more sinister than even she realises.In 1992, like many others, the pit is under threat of closure as the government progressively favours alternative sources of energy and even alternative sources of coal. The management are muddying the water by offering the workforce redundancy payments as the community closes ranks in a desperate effort to safeguard their way of life.As the determined, covert machinations of government policy grind inexorably towards their unfeeling end.. every family in the 'Grimley' community is touched by the mounting tension. But the band plays on.Supplemented by actual musicians from the Grimethorpe Colliery Band, and with sterling performances from Sue Johnson (Vera) and Mary Healey (Ida) many comic moments and situations punctuate the dark undercurrent that permeates the film.In a triumphant finish that seals the future of the band at least, art and life confront one another at The Albert Hall, London where an brass band competition is held every year.This is a heart-warming film and a fitting tribute the spirit of all the mining communities whose story is so intricately bound up in it.

The movie buffs among them loved it, maybe they didn't think it was a work of art but they enjoyed it immensely.Now, there were also a number of hard nosed cynical types who would rather watch Parliamentary Question Time than anything on the silver screen and it was their reaction that was most interesting. You could almost see them trying NOT to like it. They failed. When Stephen Tompkinsons character turns round mid performance and catches site of Pete Postlethwaites (his on screen father) character on stage, every single one of them smiled and sat further forward in their seats. Its no surprise really, when something is done this well, and performed with this degree of enthusiasm and talent and scripted with just the right levels of emotion, sentimentality, reality and despair, you've just got to love the thing. The events are based around the fortunes of a colliery band in the North of England - The coal mine is under threat from the Thatcherite governments privatisation policies and consequently the pit band and the very community itself is also in jeopardy. In these trying circumstances the band members struggle to remain focused much to the frustration of band leader Danny, (Pete Postlethwaite) who remind anyone who'll listen that music matters. Circumstances conspire though to show Danny that when it comes to the destruction of an industry and a community, the desperate and marginal life lived by his son and grandchildren and his own ailing health, music matters little. Or does it?In these dire straits music lifts everyone, if only momentarily, above the drastic reality of their lives. It binds them, unites them and fills them with pride and self-respect that is being slowly eroded by their circumstances. Watch out for some remarkable set pieces that in other hands and with other actors could have been flat or hackneyed, specifically the performance of Rodrigo's En Aranjuez Con Tu Amor to the backdrop of heated discussion between union and management. We see another wonderful and powerful moment when Phil (Stephen Tompkinson's character)is in full clown costume and turns to face the crucifix in a moment of puzzled despair. Don't rent it, buy it.

(Beware, some spoilers ahead) Yes, very sad that coal is rapidly approaching obsolescence as a profitable industry. Yes, very sad that coal pits are closed by order of Parliament, and the working class and their families gets screwed yet again. I guess the movie implies that we are to feel sorry for them, keep the mine and all the others open, just so some have a place to work. Then we are also supposed to feel sorry for those miners who choose to work in the pit their whole lives, and get Black Lung Disease. Hello? Were it not for this heavy-handed political message, it would be a very enjoyable movie. But it comes across just as somewhat entertaining.The music sounds fantastic on DVD, the selections are fresh, wonderfully arranged, and beautifully performed. As well, the acting is very good, nothing really wrong there. It's just that the sub-plots are so very cliche and predictable. And of course the humor is extremely dry, but there could have been more laughs here and there.(Major spoiler here)The ending provided very mixed emotions for me, and I can't say that I bought into it. So they win at Albert Hall after a blazing and very satisfying performance of the William Tell Overture. Danny refuses the trophy, walks center stage to the conductor's pulpit,(looked like he was getting up on his pedestal to me) and goes off on a somewhat irrelevant five minute tirade about Margaret Thatcher, the evil Tory party, the tragic closing of coal mines, and how people are more important than progress. The last point merits some consideration, but the overall message is driven home with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  The music and Pete Postlewaite's performance nudges this viewer's rating from a six to a 7/10.

I was there at a strike meeting held outside a local heavy industry site where thousands were later thrown on the scrap heap. The speech given by Pete at the end of the film sums it up exactly, he delivers it with such passion, I feel that he actually meant it.The supporting cast are superb, not a weak character or actor, but Pete nails this and it is even more poignant that he played a character riddled with cancer.

However the threaten closure of the pit itself puts the band under threat &#150; although many of the band fear the wider implications.  Danny Ormondroyd remains focused on his music despite sickness and his son's spiral of debt.  While a relationship between of the band turns sour when she is found to be working with the pit's management.  The band's music becomes an allegory for the plight of the workers.Released a year before The Full Monty made working class British comedy a Hollywood hit, this has a lot more realism and a lot more heart.  The story deals mainly with the plight of the miners &#150; betrayed and deserted by the Tory Government &#150; and the bands corresponding struggle to survive and overcome.  The metaphors are good but not heavy &#150; basically the story can work if you don't see the parallels.  The story works best due to the level of emotion the story carries.  This has a lot of heart and builds to a wonderful standoff that brings a message without being preachy.The cast are excellent.  Postlethwaite is top class as Danny and delivers a metaphor for the dying mine itself &#150; not interesting in politics, just trying to keep producing the ethics he always has but all the time knowing his time is coming.  Equally as good is Tompkinson &#150; a complex role, full of emotion and he deasl very, very well with it &#150; to me his was the performance of the film.  Fitzgerald is a little weak but a pre-Jedi McGregor is solid in support.  The rest of the band is fleshed out by solid UK faces and do well.Overall this is a great little film.

So I was surfing the movie channels, came across Brassed Off, and what hooked this former USA marching band member was the gloriously rich music that accompanied the film's action. Everything politically important has been said on the previous 12 pages of this IMDb commentary, particularly about Thatcher, Reagan (and now Bush) and that ilk, who put profit above all and people last. This film, yes, does belong in the full monty category, but even more, it falls into the Drum Line category as well--the power that music has to lift people above their ordinary lives and to help them realize the depth of their humanity. This film, like Drum Line, is an education in itself about musical traditions that millions are ignorant of. I was stunned at the richness of sound produced by a colliery band--no woodwinds to thin out the total effect.The film also has echoes of How Green Was My Valley, a film made in the 40's and set in Welsh coal-mining country, where male choral groups meet weekly and also compete in an annual national contest.In addition, as an American tourist in Yorkshire, I loved the literary aspect of that area--Bronte country, if you will--being an English teacher, but this film was a cold slap in the face concerning the reality of the fate of men and women upon whose backs and blood the nation was enriched, and who are discarded, like rusty tools, when conservative economics trumpet the importance of investors over the fate of the workers in the industry. Yes, as one commentator pointed out, coal has no future in the 21st century, but short-sightedness and greed have ignored the need for other energy solutions that could have saved those Yorkshire communities and families, and which just might make the planet inhabitable for our grandchildren--if we don't continue to be stupid.

Ewan McGregor is good too, though he doesn't get a chance to display his raw talent. Tara Fitzgerald, as the only female player in the colliery band, is also enjoyable.

Ewan McGregor is here as more a supporting character and does a decent bit, but has been better. His role is more subdued.

This is also mirrored in the on screen relationship between Ewan McGregor (Andy) and Tara Fitzgerald (Gloria), which again is remarkable, and worthy of comment.The film is also backed up in strong performances from a staple of good British actors, including Stephen Moore (McKenzie), Sue Johnston (Vera) and Jim Carter (Harry).One thing also worth mentioning in this review is some of the Cinematography, which perfectly compliments the film, and at all the right places. Shots of some particular note are the Colliery shot in Concerto D'Aranjuez (preceeding the Union meeting, showing the Colliery backlit at Night) and the shot framing the Band as they arrive back in Grimley from the Band Semi-Finals - the almost backlit qualities of the shot, framed against the sky is simply breathtaking and beautiful.In short, well worth seeing.Whatever happened to Film Four eh?

Starring Peter Postlethwaite, as Danny, Ewan McGregor, as Andy, and Tara Fitzgerald as Gloria, this drama/romance/comedy really opens your eyes to the effect the Margaret Thatcher government had on mining communities.The plot follows a small band as they battle to save their mine from closer and to continue playing.  Danny, the conductor of the band, is very passionate about his music and he strives to win the national championship. From the beginning of the film it is clear that the miners are without hope and disheartened by the possible loss of their jobs.  Their families are just as effected as they battle to put food on the table. The storyline, although weak at times, is generally entertaining and strong performances from all actors/actresses, especially Postlethwaite and McGregor, captivate the depth of such an emotional time. Probably th most distinst feature of the movie is it's soundtrack. Brilliant music including 'The William Tell Overture' and 'Danny Boy' add to the film and link together different scenes affectively.In my opinion this film was quite good and I thouroughly enjoyed watching it despite some scenes being badly crafted and unnecessary.

Grimley is a mining town, so the potential disruption is enormous. The film focuses on the members of the Grimley Colliery Brass Band, an excellent band, with little chance of survival if the mine closes. Brass bands are an important part of British life and the band and their families are a good sample of the townspeople. The band leader, Danny (Peter Postlethwaite) lives for the band and its trips to competitions but some members, thinking of future hardships, are planning to drop out. The sudden appearance of a new band member, Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald, a beautiful actress with a fascinating mouth) fascinates the all-male band and all thoughts of quitting vanish. The band goes into competition seriously, which leads to the country's finals. The point of the film is the hardships that unemployment can have on individuals and communities. That point is made implicitly, throughout the film and very explicitly in a surprise ending that could have been inspired by Frank Capra (It's a Wonderful Life).The film makes one feel good and the brass band music is played exquisitely.

The reality of this film is neither of the aforementioned, but instead a moving story about the relationship between a man (Danny - Pete Postlethwaite) and his son (Phil - Stephen Tomkinson).Danny is a band leader, who believes that his son is only interested in the politics of his job and situation. Phil is a miner, deep in debt, who believes that his father is blind to the realities of the forthcoming pit closure and is only interested in music.Through their common bond, the rich and strident brass that punctuates the film, they realise that what is really important to them is each other.Forget the Danny/Gloria sub plot and contextualise the final speech from political rhetoric to a personal realisation.It's a great film - enjoy the ride.

In some ways it is a film one would expect to be formulaic the girl shows her prowess and gets to play with the boys; the scruffy young boy falls in love with the nice young girl and gets her to show all of her prowess; the normal man rises above every pitfall imaginable in life; all hopes are put upon winning and the underdog becomes victor. But in many other ways it is quite original for film.  What some might refer to as contradictions in focus I see as evidence of fair and realistic movie-making. Yes, those in the film are decidedly anti-Tory and are the heroes of the piece (although they are so charasmatic that I cannot imagine fighting against them), but three-quarters of the workers voted for redundancy, even some of our major heroes. Working hard, earning their pay in the coal mines brought Danny near death.Only in the world of film would an idea be conceived and brought to full term in a timely fashion without any valid issues to contradict.  I found that realism refreshing-- a focus in on one side while letting the other play around it. I enjoyed the fact that it was strong on plot, but not full of it.  It based itself around a few powerful points and let the characters unravel around them.  Pete Postlethwaite, of course, did a fine job, and Stephen Tompkinson was wonderful as his son.  Even someone with such a powerful screen presence as Ewan McGregor fit beautifully into this band, none stronger than the weakest among them, and no performance was weak. On a side note, as an American, I thoroughly enjoyed that foray into British accentuation and slang.  I am used to the utter proper pronouncements I so often see on PBS, and this lent a great deal to the endearing nature of the characters, I thought.

I was especially sorry because I thought most of those same people would enjoy 'Brassed Off' if they gave it a chance. Fortunately since then word-of-mouth and the success of a somewhat similar film, 'The Full Monty', have helped to give it more viewers.'Brassed Off' has often been compared to 'The Full Monty' and despite any differences they certainly do share many similarities, especially to an American audience. They give looks at ordinary English lives and culture so seldom seen over here that they almost seem exotic. This movie is less obviously a comedy than 'TFM' but it has lots of wonderful humorous moments. They are needed to keep the political sentiments of the film from getting too strident. The anti-Thatcher tone of the film otherwise might get tiring, even to one sympathetic to those beliefs.This was the first film I'd ever seen Pete Postlethwaite in and not surprisingly I came away impressed. I imagine the image many people will carry away from the film is Danny conducting the brass band, looking more serious than Leonard Bernstein in front of the Vienna Philharmonic. Tara Fitzgerald was excellent in her role, too. One of the interesting subtexts of the movie was the effect a pretty woman can have on a group of men.I'd just like to encourage people to try something different every once in a while, and this film seems to me a good place to start.

I felt that perhaps if a tiny bit of time could be taken off focussing on the characters, and instead show more plot, instead of for example showing all the band's failures in local competitions in a brief musical sequence, the film would be better off. And the end ... well, it ends on a high note (literally), and boy gets girl, but there's still a slightly hollow feeling with regards to the mine.

No one does working-class anger and analysis like our British cousins from across the sea. Brassed Off takes place in Grimley, a small mining village in Worchestershire, England, threatened by the possibility of their mine closing. Tara Fitzgerald plays Gloria Mullen, a surveyor for the Grimley Mining Company, whose job is to create a study that she thinks will keep Grimley open and save jobs. My figures show Grimley has a future. It's a profitable pit, she tells Andy, her friend, fellow band member, and old flame. Ewan MacGregor, as Andy Barrow, is one hard realist who schools her in the ways of management's shady plans over coffee one night.You're report means as much to them as we do. . . bugger all. . . And those good eggs at the head office think they've done all they can. Oh dear. . . they've been very fair, very reasonable. Done their best, done their sums and - oh dear - they just don't add up! They'll have to close another pit &#x96; a shame &#x96; and they probably made their decision why you were still in college. Gloria can't understand why Andy will vote to keep the mine open then, if the majority of miners will be voting for redundancy - to close the mine and take a buy-out. No hope &#x96; just principles, he replies. Amid the backdrop of this drama, Gloria and Andy's budding relationship suffers a few bumps and bruises along the way. A few of the more vocal Grimley Colliery Brass Band members accuse Andy of being a scab and Gloria a management sellout until almost the bitter end. The film intersperses strike scenes and family crisis's with rousing band numbers, as they practice for a musical competition. The late &#x96; and great &#x96; Peter Postlethwaite, portrays Danny, the orchestra's leader &#x96; in good times and bad. The musical numbers represent the spirit of the town as the villagers grapple with their pressure and problems. He encourages the band members to keep going, no matter what, even if it means the further deterioration of his own poor health. Danny believes that the band can win fist prize, which symbolizes their collective spirit - undaunted and unbowed.During her viability study report to management, Gloria discovers that Andy's predictions are all-too accurate, right down to the timing of their decision to close Grimley. Gloria discovers that she too has principles and resigns her cushy position, which ultimately enables the band to travel to the band finals at Albert Hall. The band plays on, all the way to Albert Hall, even though many of the members are cynical and demoralized, knowing that their lives will be forever changed as a result of management's callous actions. And although Grimley closes, Danny and Gloria are able to rally the Grimley Brass Banders to play their hearts out in London at the National Band Competition, winning first place. Danny . . .over the last ten years, this bloody government has systematically destroyed an entire industry. OUR industry. And not just our industry - our communities, our homes, our lives. All in the name of progress. And for a few lousy bob. I'll tell you something else you might not know, as well. A fortnight ago, this band's pit were closed - another thousand men lost their jobs. And that's not all they lost. Most of them lost the will to win a while ago. A few of them even lost the will to fight. But when it comes to losing the will to live, to breathe, the point is - if this lot were seals or whales, you'd all be up in bloody arms. But their not, are they, no, no they're not. They're just ordinary common-or-garden honest, decent human beings. And not one of them with an ounce of bloody hope left. Oh aye, they can knock out a bloody good tune. But what the f*#k does that matter? And now I'm going to take my boys out onto the town. Thank you. See what I mean?

I was expecting as I had seen from the trailer a funny, small-town British movie about a brass band and their dealing with competitions and a mine closing. But it wasn't funny, or the funny parts of about it were few and far between. This movie wanted to be a misfit-gets-the-big-award movie, an inspiring-leader-is-dying movie, a comedy, a romance, a drama, a government-keeps-the-people down movie. But by trying to overcome the conventions of all these preceding genres, it becomes conventional and misguided I felt. It didn't get the best out of the actors (except for maybe Pete Postlethwaite who adds flair to gusto to any performance). Ewan McGregor and Tara Fitzgerald can offer more to a movie and the story didn't allow them to progress their characters all that much. AND I didn't feel a whole lot of chemistry between Fitzgerald and McGregor so I didn't feel a whole lot for their romance. The only thing I felt for was the story of the man who was busting his butt to get food for his family because the mines had closed. This part of the storyline had me thinking, is the romance really that important? Shouldn't they focus on the gut-wrenching fact that this mine were these people's lives and once you took it away, what could they live on? But it didn't focus on that, so I could only have so much feeling for this part of the story. And by the time Pete Postlethwaite's character was in the hospital, I had little feeling for that because it was another tragic thing piled on more tragic things. Had the story smartly balanced the comedic factors and the dramatic factors (so that by being funny and then turning sad, it makes the sad parts sadder) I think it would have been an excellent film. But please, I have seen better misfit-films and romantic comedies, seeing this one does not make anyone the wiser. If you want a better political films combined with comedy I suggest The Full Monty and Billy Elliott.

I would have chose something else. King Coal maybe? I dunno... anything but Brassed Off.Anyway, I'm from one of South Yorkshire's ex-mining communities so I approached this film with a more critical mind. The coalfields have never been depicted well on film so I approached this with low expectations... and it exceeded them.This film really feels like they did their research. The accents are done pretty well and I definitely feel like I'm looking at a Barnsley mining village when I watch it, so I guess they did well with that. It's one of the better portrayals of South Yorkshire's coalfields, though there are still Northerner clichés in places that bug me.The main problem with this film is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It doesn't know if it's a comedy or a hard hitting social commentary condemning Thatcher and the Conservative party. If they wanted to do a social commentary they should have just done a straight up social commentary. No need for any romance stuff. It's the social commentary and seeing how these characters cope with the situations they face which interest me the most and make this movie.There is comedy in here, which does stop the film from getting too depressing and political, though saying that if you're looking for a comedy then you might be disappointed as it does get pretty serious in the middle of the movie as the harsh reality of the situation hits home for the characters. If you're looking for more laughs I recommend The Full Monty instead.I really wish they would have gotten rid of the unnecessary sub plot; the relationship between Gloria and Andy. To me it brings brings nothing to the movie, but I suppose at the time there was the mentality that you must have at least one tale of romance in a film. I suppose if that's your thing (like the Jack and Rose romance on Titanic) then you'll like it I suppose. They do have chemistry. It's just not what I think the film should have a large focus on. The mine is closing and this probably had a huge effect on the lives of people in that community. The romance sub-plot is small potatoes.It's a good film, though in my opinion The Full Monty did it better. It blended comedy, romance, drama, commentary on masculinity and politics way better. Brassed Off didn't keep it simple, doesn't flow as well, feels like a load of ideas slopped into one and the romance sub-plot is too distracting and ruins the film. I still recommend you watch this though (maybe after The Full Monty). The cast are outstanding, the film has characters that you really want to root for, the music is great, the film at times is incredibly touching and sad and if you live in a ex-mining area like i do the message at the end really hits home.

As I grow old, I have noticed how cruel life is & how corrupt our captors have become. This film's greatest irony is that they intended 'music to appear commonplace; a bit of entertainment whilst more important things are happening'. You sense this is the way it was written. However, as this film ages, it's become apparent that Governments destroy people's hopes & dreams all the time. This has now become commonplace, & the music represents the constant accumulating working class heroes that have fallen to vain man's greed. It gives the film new meaning. It's a shame that at the end of the film, they still insist this is about Coal Mines Closing. It's maybe a bit short sighted of British film makers to abstain from giving it a broader meaning. The script isn't without it's typical British frivolity of course, & most of the time it's non-intrusive thank goodness! The course language may be a bit loud for some as is the stereotypes, but given the time & setting it's not unrealistic. I think it's this that gives the film it's lower score & yet it's vital to lighten up an otherwise dejecting story.

The pit which constitutes for many blue collars their sole course of action (even their raison d'être) is on the brink of closing down. A good number of them gathers to play in a brass band, the Grimley Colliery Band, led by Danny, a tubercular but steady conductor who devotes in it all his energy and this is where things go askew. If Danny advocates an intensive training and demands from his fellows more investment, his occasional musicians are more preoccupied by the impending closing down of the pit. And the arrival of a young woman, Gloria who works for the governmental agency who has to cut off the jobs antagonized many members. Then, in the space of a few days, things happen quickly the minors choose to vote for voluntary unemployment, the pit closes down but in the meanwhile, the band wins several musical competitions which enable them to attend the finale in the prestigious Royal Albert Hall. It's a momentum concert to enable them to express their plight and their anger against Thatcherism.The director Mark Herman chose to locate his half-comic, half-tragic film in a prickly British era so as to stress the ravages of Thatcherism on the mining industry and to make the audience feel how much thousands of minors suffered by finding themselves jobless overnight. There are echoes with Ken Loach's cinema the gloomy setting, a category of workers (here, minors) with a more than modest living standards and the same committed side to sympathize with their plight. However, Herman's piece of work contains a good dose of humor and it's not a free choice from the director to have incorporated it into his scenario. The very last sequences with their false air of happy-end and the rueful background would convey an impending sorrow. Herman perfectly understood that it was vital to include this component because the end of the film will abandon these castoffs to their fate. This indispensable humor usually linked with the brass musical sequences and cleverly tapped in the way it precedes according a more or less lapse of time a raw or gritty scene stops the movie from falling in a desperate blackness and paves the way to a formula Herman applied with gusto here mix slightness with gravity. Inthis respect, his directorial style works wonders like this ingenious alternate editing in one scene when we see the orchestra play and the tension which arises in the put office and the declarations made by the manager to the journalists.But Herman's directing often rises to the occasion, notably during one of the key-moments the finale scene. His camera, either makes itself as inconspicuous as possible to let the musicians take advantage of this moments either aerial to enhance it. Symbols are also the director's forte the billiard ball which eventually succeeds in falling in the hole anticipates the film's finale whereas Phil's empty house after the bailiffs' coming and the withdrawal of his wife and children reflects his despondent state of mind. Herman also shelved certain narrative conventions the end of the film in which we don't smell any odor of happy end diverts the codes of the success story these minors and occasional musicians will have won the national competition and known their hour of glory but it won't alter the murky future that awaits them. In a way the viewer identifies himself to the audience in the Royal Albert Hall bitter, helpless and Danny's speech is of a harrowing speech. Then, in another extent, look at the love Andy (Ewan McGregor) feels for Gloria. Where a Hollywood director would have filmed their love affair from the beginning, Herman is more astute at this game and proceeds by small touches we only sees close-ups of McGregor and lets the suggested filter through. The 2 young people will exchange their first kiss only in the very last sequence.It would be a crime to pass over the topnotch and true to life cast. The actors take their roles with an admirable easiness and naturalness.

When British cinema is able to incorporate laughter in a thorny social situation, it can shine and Mark Herman's flick is a good example, see it at any costs!

The fact is the miners - like the print workers involved in the later Wapping dispute - were badly led by political dinosaurs who saw confrontation as the only course,and came up against a Prime Minister with a large majority and an iron grip over her cabinet . It is also often forgotten that a significant section of the N.U.M. did not support the strike and continued to work despite violent retribution being visited on them by their fellow Union members. Such was the power of the Union that in Nottingham in 1984 there were still streets where people did not speak to their neighbours because of differences originating in the General Strike of 1926. In this movie all these strong feelings resonate through the rather right on storyline of the four legs good,two legs bad ilk. Most people had a lot of sympathy for the miners - their animosity was reserved for Mr Scargill who gave every appearance of being willing to let his members starve to death in order to prove a political point. It was his bloody - mindedness that brought mining communities to their knees with only their dignity to cling to. And their sense of community . And their music. Brass band music is plaintive even when determinedly cheerful and exactly reflects the mood that runs through the movie. Mr P.Postlethwaite and Mr S.Thompkinson are outstanding in their roles as father and son with more than a generation gap between them. Mr Thompkinson in particular has a depth beyond the exterior blandness he sometimes exhibits.It seems to me he reached inside himself to find a truth,a bewilderment and a passion that inhabits his role.I found,and still find,it hard to look him in the eye as he agonises in his clown outfit. Mr Postlethwaite,all indignation and stubbornness,has the pride and dignity of the lifelong worker betrayed by his government,his union and,finally,his health. Miss T.Fitzgerald,daughter of the hated Boss class,is them rather than us and finds it hard to be accepted despite a solo on the Concierto de Aranjuez that rivals that of Miles Davis. Of course it is a political film and its politics are of the fashionable luvvie left rather than the hard Scargillite variety that sees no shade of grey.As the years pass the attitudes on both sides of the dispute harden,the former mining communities continue to suffer the after - effects and the future remains bleak.Wherever you personally consider the blame lies -whether it be with the intractable Mrs Thatcher or the equally intractable Mr Scargill - the innocent victims of their duel are still paying the price.Brassed Off demonstrates that resilience and comradeship are the best weapons against oppression whatever its source.

This nice film, very British but universal in nature, has fine performances, especially by Postlewaite. The story, too, is a heart grabber from start to finish. Better yet, the musicality displayed by the brass band is magnificent. One could listen to them forever. There is a romance as well, a satisfying one. The conditions of this brave town sober anyone on the subject of jobs and the importance for hard working people to get a fair shake in life.

If it turns out that - for whatever reason - we are actually better off WITHOUT the coal being removed from the ground, then we clearly should leave it where it is.  (It might be different if coal mining were a pleasant activity.  It isn't.)  What happens to the people who were previously paid money to mine coal is a separate question let them starve, subsidise their brass bands, create some other industry, or simply pay them to do nothing, depending on what you think is right.  WHY, exactly, are we meant to think that coal mining is inherently worthwhile?Well, for the sake of argument, let's suppose it is.  I've swallowed sillier propositions in order to enjoy a good story.  Coal mining ought to be preserved for its own sake regardless of whether anyone requires coal. Okay.  So there's this woman named Gloria who wants to stand up for what is noble and save the fabulous coal mines from the evil board of directors; and she mistakenly thinks that writing a report which demonstrates that the mines are economically viable will do this.  As a matter of fact she's wrong.  AT WORST she misdirects her energies on a project that will have no effect on either the mine or the miners.  Why, then, do all of the miners hate her so much?  What, even from their point of view, has she done that's wrong?  I don't get this, either.Does this matter?  I think it does.  When I say that I don't understand the miner's point of view, or what is going on in the debate about whether or not to close the mines, I mean it literally I don't understand.  The film could have explained some of this to me but it didn't.  And - this is aesthetically irrelevant but I mention it anyway - clearly the makers of the film were sinking the boot into doctrinaire right-wing politicians.  I heartily approve.  But with so many comprehensible bones of contention out there, why pick this one?It's all the more surprising, then, that Brassed Off is good after all. Romantic comedy, it's not in fact it's unremitting gloom, a journey into the heart of depression, offering only two or three moments of joy and no grounds whatever for any kind of hope.  We soon learn that brass bands do NOT have a jolly sound.  Nor do they sound melancholy rather they are clean, almost acerbic, a medium for people who want to really HEAR the music, unadorned with schmaltz.

It's true that there is a fierce undercurrent of anti right wing leaning running through the movie, but to portray the characters any other way would be factually inaccurate. Some may view Thatcher as a Saint, but characters like those in Brassed Off can only ever view her as an evil tyrant. Anyway I'm going off on a tangent now.

The Grimley brass band seemed a bit over-endowed with Tuba's for my liking (there are usually only 2 or 3 Tuba's in a typical brass band - there seemed to be at least half a dozen in this case!), however my guess is that it was easier to hide an actor behind a Tuba where they wouldn't have to finger the valves than it would have been to have the actors sitting behind a lesser instrument like a trumpet or cornet.Just a small point. Real musicians wouldn't ever carry their instruments through the streets on full display as they make their way to the practise session. Far too easy to damage them. All serious musicians carry their instruments in hard cases which can take the slight knocks. In many scenes the Grimley band members were walking through the streets with just the instrument under their arm.

The band's director, Danny, played by the wonderful Pete Postlewaite, is dying of black lung disease and his greatest wish is to win the national band competition before the mine closes.  These central events could have been made into a great film, instead of just a very good one.  Unfortunately, though, Mark Herman, the film's writer and director, chose to turn `Brassed Off' into an anti Margaret Thatcher, anti Conservative government polemic.  And that is too bad.  The desperation of these characters and their families juxtaposed with the genuinely exciting competition for the band championship, both supported by great band music, often moved me.  In fact, I have seldom seen a movie that has used music as effectively as Herman used it in`Brassed Off.'In an early scene, a young woman named Gloria, played by Tara Fitzgerald, who grew up in the fictional town of Grimsley has come back as a member of management of the mine.  She seeks to join the band.  It turns out that she is a talented flugelhorn player and she plays a solo as the band plays a beautiful Spanish piece for wind band.  As the band plays, the scene shifts to a conference room in the mine's headquarters, showing an argument between labor and management representatives but without letting us hear what is said.  Then workers are shown at the mine.  Finally, after the band finishes its number, its other members applaud Gloria for her beautiful solo.There are moments of quiet humor, too.  For example the bus the band uses to drive to competitions has a sign painted on it side that says, `London, New York, Paris, Grimsley.'  Danny the band director's son, Phil, played by Stephan Tompkinson, is beaten up by a repo man who has repossessed his furniture.  As Danny is comforting Phil at the emergency room where Phil is being treated for his injuries a nurse asks, `Is this man bothering you?' To which Phil replies, `'Course he is. He's me dad.' Danny's speech immediately following the band competition - along with a number of other lines throughout the film - were so meanspirited that I was bothered by them.  It seemed to me that Herman would have been far better advised to stick to music and the human condition, and leave economics and politics for another forum.  Typically, though, the film rights itself in the next scene atop a London bus in which the band plays again and the pride of its victory in the band competition shines in all the players' faces. Despite its ill-advised and preachy political commentary, there is far more to like than to dislike in `Brassed Off.'  8 out of 10.

The reasons why I didn't think it was totally marvelous1. The political bits ... essentially I thought that the portrayal of the lovable lads (good) on the one side and the 'orrible capitalists and scabs on the other was a bit cheap.  It was a somewhat different story with Thatcher, who had bizarre ideas about having to shut down everything old economy so that England could become a second U S of A full of drive - ins and theme parks, but after Thatcher the collieries continued to close not because of a political agenda but simply because they weren't economical (and the same thing happened all around Europe);  so it's difficult to become all huffed up about it.  I would have preferred to see a more sensitive portrayal of a single - business community in crisis rather this orgy of commiseration.2. Tara Fitzgerald ... I thought that she was just too cutesy and prim, and I didn't believe the her being the master trumpeter (or whatever it was she was playing) bit.

There's a lot of great music, good performances, and touching stories, and throughout a lot of this movie I was very entertained.  In particular, the three-line exchange beginning with Would you like to come up for a coffee? contains some of the best comic timing I've heard in a long time.  Most unfortunately, however, the breadth of this movie bites off more than it can chew, and the handling of its political side left me with a sour taste in my mouth.The most obvious of this movie's weaknesses is the fact that it argues against the closure of the mining pit the members of the band work at (never mind that the band is easily good enough to turn professional), while barely recognizing the fact that the workers themselves had the opportunity to keep the pit open, and passed on it.  Does it not make sense to anyone else that if the closing of the pit were a fundamental wrong, as the movie states, that the workers of the pit would have voted against it?The characters of this movie utter Progress as though it were a four-letter word.  And faced with the closure of their pit, their viewpoints are understandable -- no one enjoys losing their job -- but the movie goes beyond the tragedy associated with being pushed to change, and instead argues that the closing of these coal mines is an absolute evil.  Yes, as the final political tub-thumping speech reveals, the English government has systematically destroyed an entire industry.  But to be fair to the other side, it's an industry that just as systematically destroys the lungs of its workers (a situation which the movie also capitalizes on, without ever arguing that something might be wrong with the system because of it), and that doesn't mention the destruction of the environment due to pollution.It's a shame that a movie as otherwise entertaining as this one gets lost in a political message that doesn't hold water.  The characters, while entertaining, are so completely arch conservative that they defy common sense.  And the movie is so convinced that its message is right that it skips right over the holes in its logic and pretends they aren't important.The ending of this movie makes for the greatest case of this differential, as the band gives an amazing rendition of the William Tell Overture, and then follows it up with a political speech so contrived and devoid of reason that I felt sick before it was through.Although I mildly recommend this movie, I suggest you watch it for entertainment value only.  To analyze the reasoning, or lack thereof, behind its political hubbub is to lose a lot of respect for it.

A grimy little Yorkshire town is plunged into economic distress when the tories close the coal mine; the townsfolks' last gasp of civic pride is to back the competitive efforts of the coal miners' brass band.  The movies' lessons corporations are evil; conservatism destroys everything in its path; Thatcher was another Hitler and should be dead; and the rich got that way by plundering and looting the working classes, driving them into poverty and despair.  As proof of how evil these corporate types are, they're phasing out the coal industry in favor of--oh my God!--atomic energy!!!HOW MANY WAYS DO THE LIBERALS WANT TO HAVE IT???For years they've griped about how how dirty fossil fuels are, how coal and oil are destroying our fragile planet.  Propose a cleaner, cheaper, and, yes, SAFER alternative, like nukes, and suddenly an 18th-century power source is a symbol of the oppressed and downtrodden masses.  But how many people have died in nuclear power plant accidents?  UK 0.  USA 0.  (Former USSR who knows?  Chernobyl is hardly relevant, since it was a low-tech, late-'50s-style piece of junk like everything else the Soviets built.)  Now how many people have been killed by coal mining--by cave-ins and other accidents, and by black-lung disease, which strikes down one of the movie's main characters and has killed the grandfather of another?  Why this morbid, sentimental attachment to such a filthy, deadly way of making a living?  This pointless struggle against progress and economic reality reminds me of an earlier episode of British history, when the weavers' guilds fought the proliferation of textile mills in the Industrial Revolution.  And imagine all the buggy-whip manufacturers and horse-dung shovelers who were put out of work by the car.  Coal is history, one of the suits says--and he's right.  Beyond their immediate disruption, the miners and their families fail to see that their real problem is something observed in the I Ching some 2500 years ago that most people limit their opportunities by defining themselves too narrowly--by seeing themselves, in this case, ONLY as coal miners in a town with no coal mine.  The obvious solution is to seek the answer to the question what else can I do?  Yet the movie heaps humiliation and despair onto the one miner who seeks to open an alternative avenue of income by developing other talents as a clown for children's parties, he literally makes a fool of himself.  And even the coal miners' brass band, who are dedicated, dead serious, and professional in quality, treat their awesome skills as a hobby.  I don't know how it is in the UK, but here in the States, these guys would've cut a series of CDs and sold them by the thousands.  DO SOMETHING ELSE!!  Yes, it's easier said than done, but I'm talking about what's possible, not what's easy; about opportunities, not guarantees; and about what people can do for themselves, either individually or in chosen groups such as the band, as opposed to what big business or big government can do FOR them or give TO them.  The movie heavy-handedly invites the viewer to draw your own conclusions.  These are mine, and I'm sure the writer/director would find me recalcitrant for refusing to be led to the conclusions he carefully crafts by telling--inaccurately--only one side of the story.

Once you do that, you'll be considerably more than just brassed off.Thanks for listening, You've been a wonderful audience, Good day!P.S. This film's c**p (just in case you didn't get the gist of my rant)! "}]
