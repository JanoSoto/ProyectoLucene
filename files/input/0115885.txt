This fourth installment also has a very high rating on the gore scale as well with some rather gruesome killings. If you have not yet seen this one but have others in the series it is worth the time.

I was delighted to find out that not only is this film better than the previous sequel, but it's the best in a so-so series. How did they manage that? Pros Strong direction by Greg Spence, who made his debut with this film. Excellent performances. Some chills. Inventive death sequences. A feeling of dread hangs over the film. An attempt to start a new storyline, and a good one at that. Plenty of blood and gore. Some effective dream sequences.Cons Relies a bit too much on dream sequences for it's scares. Some may be disappointed that this has little to do with the rest of the series. The short running time makes it hard for some things to develop. Since this film has so little to do with the other films in the series, it may have been better had they called it something else.Final thoughts While the first two are OK, and III is unmemorable, this sequel is a vast improvement over all of them and even the ones that followed. Fans of the first three should watch this one with caution though because aside from the title, the fact that it's set in Nebraska, and that it has to do with evil kids controlled by a demon, it has nothing to do with the other films in the series. A sleeper!

As Margaret Rhodes, (Jaime Renee Smith) and James Rhodes, (Mark Salling) both start to come down with the flu, the children of the entire town come down with it as well. While trying to treat the cases with Doc Larson, (William Windom) it disappears but the children start to act mysteriously. When a series of murders engulfs the town, Grace and Donald Atkins, (Brent Jennings) the father of one of the children, track down the culprit, a young teen Josiah, (Brandon Klevla) who corrupts the children to eliminate the adults.The Good News This one surprised me, and was far better than it should've been. The best aspect about this film was it's very high gore quotient. There isn't all that huge of a body count, but what's there is some of the more imaginative kills in the genre. One is nailed to a door with needles with a scythe thrown from behind them breaks through the door and impales them in the head, having a scythe rammed through the back and come out through the chest, having their fingers lopped off, dragged by barbed wire face-first into an uprooted pitchfork and many more gruesome moments. With many non-gore kills and with some hallucinations thrown in, it's quite a surprisingly gory flick. Even more impressive is that they are all involved in some big action scenes. It's nearly impossible to describe them without giving the film away, but all those scenes are great. There's even some suspense granted, with an eerie chase through a dimly-lit cornfield. With the preceding circumstances around it, it becomes all the creepier. The opening half's dealing with the strange virus and the mystery is pretty well-handled, giving a glimpse of what's to come while even throwing a surprise into it as well. The ending confrontation is full of action and suspense as well, which sends it out on a perfectly appropriate spectacle ending. This is a pretty decent edition to the series.The Bad News There really isn't a whole lot that really didn't work in this one, and it's got to deal with the fact that it rarely has anything to do with the other films. It discards the cornfields and the psycho-babble that the others dealt with and instead concentrates on a mysterious disease and the race to discover what it is. That is a wrong move for two reasons. It's already quite clear very early on what's going on, as an early murder and resurrection is dealt with in this manner that goes undiscovered for a long time. By the time it's been discovered, it's been so long coming that it's merely old hat by then. Very rarely is a film that far behind the audience, and this one is. The other major problem is that it never once really put anyone that was supposed to survive in any danger of them possibly not making it. There's always a very easy way out of the suspenseful parts where they're supposed to be tortured, and it's always a shame when it's all over so quickly and easily. Otherwise, these were the two main problems with the film.The Final Verdict It's decent enough, but it's by no means all that spectacular entry in the series. If it fixed a couple of minor problems and kept a fun atmosphere as it does, then it would probably be a more remembered film, and can really only be recommended to hardcore fans of the series or Naomi Watts fans.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and several scenes of children in danger "},{"Title":"Great installment to the Children of the Corn series!","Date":"31 August 2006","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Horror, Thriller","Review":" This is a very well done film indeed.

After the horrible monster effects in Part III's finale (which almost completely ruined the movie for me) I was hoping The Gathering would head in a new direction, which it did. This sequel concerns a small town in the midwest. Naomi Watts plays Grace, a medical student who returns to care for her mother, and in turn, her young siblings, who begin to display a strange illness manifesting in all the town's children. Turns out that the cult of children are back, trying to recruit more young'ns (after killing their parents) into their organization for he who walks behind the rows.No doubt, one of the most memorable things about this film is Naomi Watts' performance, who showed chops even her in her first lead role. I'm sure most people who see this will recognize her from the hit Japanese remake The Ring. Even still, Children of the Corn IV The Gathering is one of the standout films of the series for a variety of other reasons. It is well-shot, for one; while it is a direct-to-video picture, it surprisingly doesn't really look like one. There is an unnerving sleepiness to the film that plays off of the bucolic midwestern set pieces, and some phenomenally creepy sequences featuring Karen Black as Watts' agoraphobic mother. The film makes ample use of its dusty farmhouses and the sinister images of children lurking across the road.Granted, the film does show its B-movie teeth in some of the murder sequences, which are far- fetched and at times absurd, but the splatter factor here is strong and the gore effects are rather convincing overall. Another obvious but vital element to this film working as well is it does is the strength of the performances. Watts, again, is great in her first lead here, and Karen Black is phenomenal as she always is&#x97; the role leaves her plenty of room to act out the eccentricities she does so well. Even the performances from the children are above-average for a film like this.Overall, if you're a fan of the series, this is one of the better (and perhaps maybe the best) sequel. It's a Children of the Corn sequel, so obviously it is not a flawless film, but it is well-shot and there are a handful of genuinely effective moments to be had, and the film paces itself well without devolving into schlock. Enjoy your straight-to-video splat with a side of Watts and Karen Black&#x97; how can you go wrong? 7/10.

An attempt at a cheap thrill, these films are usually more laughable than scary.  But the Children of the Corn franchise is probably the most interesting of this genre.I remember renting this particular installment of Children of the Corn at the fresh young age of 14 for a slumber party with some friends.  We had all seen COTC 1, 2, 3, so what the heck, why not check out 4?  There was nothing particularly different about the plot  again, the children of a midwestern town all mysteriously turn evil, killing their parents in interesting, grotesque ways.  There were the same laughable moments in which writers contrive clever new ways for a child to kill an adult and the same lame horror film dialogue.  It was all the same.  Except one thing.The performance of the lead heroine was stunning!  Not your typical STV calibar performance, but instead, WOW--complex, understated, and intense, I was very impressed with the no-name lead actress.Fast forward to seven years later, in which I am reading an interview with my favorite new actress, Naomi Watts and she mentions, I was in Children of the Corn IV and ohmygosh, the planets have aligned, it all makes sense! This stellar actress was giving stellar performances long before she was cast into stellar movies.So the short of it, if you are at all a fan of Naomi Watts, this is not a bad one to get a glimpse of her pre-Mulholland Dr. work.

Others have said this is the best film in the series (even outdoing the original), and I think that a case could be made for that. Certainly it is better than part three, which is ironic considering that this film was straight-to-video and part three actually appeared in theaters.The entire franchise is a bit silly, and how it resulted in so many sequels (seven?) is beyond me.

The cut version that I have on DVD separates itself from the original story of he who walks behind the rows giving a fresh look to the franchise. A lot of question marks are raised throughout the beginning, but nothing is really answered until the later half of the film.Grace Rhodes comes to her hometown of Grand Island, Nebraska to take care of her mother June who is having nightmares of sick children. June has also become to paranoid to leave her front yard. In addition to looking after her mother, she has to take care of her younger siblings. June's nightmares also include a young boy dressed in a preacher like outfit, and we later find out his name is Josiah. Anyways, June's visions of sick children comes true. All of the kids in Grand Island start becoming ill with high fevers and pretty soon their teeth begin to fall out. And that's when some of the adults in town begin dying off in gruesome ways.The big plot reveal (told to viewers near the end of the film) is that Josiah was taken in by some travelling preachers as a child and eventually became a very gifted preacher. Over the years, Josiah never grew out of boyhood and stopped aging. The travelling preachers gave him over to darkness to stunt his growth, but when word got out, they abandoned him. Josiah killed the preachers and then the townspeople burned him alive and sealed his remains in a well. Grace also finds out that Josiah can control all of the children in the town by finding a child like himself (a lie child). That child is Grace's sister Margaret. The lie surrounding Margaret is that she is actually Grace's daughter whom Grace abandoned years ago. It's up to Grace to destroy Josiah and save the children. Children of the Corn IV is a step up from part III. The films itself looked a lot cleaner and sophisticated then it's predecessor and I liked the franchise returning to the rural setting.

With the help of her mother (KAREN BLACK) she attempts to find out all she can about the boy preacher & send him back to where he came from, before he reaches his full powers. What I found to be interesting about this sequel is that, it's a rare movie (at least my town & the surrounding counties it is) in fact it only came out to video after CHILDREN OF THE CORN V FIELDS OF TERROR was released! I recently bought the film along with Parts 3 & 5 on a triple disc & this is the first time I've seen in since 1998! What I was surprised to learn when seeing it for the first time in many a year, is how the sequel barely relates to the films that came before & after it. First & foremost, the series mainstay villain He Who Walks Behind The Rows is nowhere to be seen! Instead the film mainly focuses on a murdered, evil boy preacher, named Josiah, who has returned from his grave to cause children to have horrendous fevers, lose their teeth & then serve as vessels for the dead children who followed him many years ago. In fact the kids here are not evil, only Josiah, indeed he does practically all of the killings throughout the film & what's also notable, is how the film is not connected to the cornfields, nor set in Gatlin Nebraska like the others were. While this could have spelled disaster, the truth of the matter is, CHILDREN OF THE CORN IV THE GATHERING winds up being better than a lot of the sequels to the original Corn film. The acting for the most part worked & the direction was well handled, with the director GREG SPENCE actually managing to conjure up a few jump out of you're seat moments & a few nasty, gory kills, plus the story is very interesting & the characterization is plenty fleshed out. But the question still remains Just how many of these dead boy preachers were there & why is it they have only returned at set times? Parts 1/2/5 all had children who were then currently alive to serve as leaders, but 3/4/7 all had supernatural entities leading the kids, some of which remained silent & unseen throughout most of the previous films carnage. All that aside, CHILDREN OF THE CORN IV THE GATHERING is a highly enjoyable little scare fest, it's pace sometimes slows here & there, but on a whole I highly recommend you see this sequel.

The way Josiah is killed is lame. He gets sprayed by gasoline laced water when Watts blasts the holding tank with her gun and it melts his skin once the water hits him.Then she uses her gun to knock him into the pool which doubles as a portal to hell and hes dead??

It's at Doc's clinic that strange things begin to happen with it suddenly being overcrowded with children who came down with high fevers and suffering from mercury poisoning. No one knows what's causing these strange maladies until we get the low down towards the end of the movie from the elderly and almost senile Nock sisters Jane & Rosa, Salle Ellis & Marietta Marich, about some boy preacher named Josiah who was kept young by his followers by stuffing him with mercury in order to stunt his growth.It's seems that the preacher boy was later burned at the stake by his disappointed, in him growing up, followers and is now back seeking revenge by getting the children of the town to slaughter all the adults for what they, or their parents and grand parents, did to him. There's also the side story to who's to replace this Josiah who's to come from the same background that he came from In being abounded by his or her parents.Very confusing story especially in what the purpose in it is of showing grasshoppers or locust as evil messenger's of the devil without explaining why. We do in fact have some very shocking slasher, with the use of a scythe, scenes in it that makes the movie worth watching if you have the stomach to see them through. Even these scenes get a bit overdone with in one case poor Doc Larson who was cut in two earlier in the film getting shot to pieces by his assistant Grace, who didn't recognize him, with a shotgun as his other half, the bottom part of his body, was lying in state.***SPOILERS*** It's Mr, Donald Atkins, Brant Jennings, young Marcus's dad who finally finds the magic bullet, filled with mercury, that can put an end to this horror. Atkins together with Grace drives down to the old Spelling Barn where the possessed town children are holding a rally, or human sacrifice, in order to save them from themselves. Even though Donald did the driving through the corn field it was Grace who did the blasting with her shotgun who finally put an end to this bloody, with all the kids cutting their hands open and dripping their blood into what looked like a wooden punchbowl, insanity. That's until the next cornball Children of the Corn flick comes to video store of theater near you to start it all over again.

The third, well the ending was bad, and it wasn't scary, this one is good despite not having much to do with Issac and He who Walks Behind the rows, it had a decent plot and creepy atmosphere. The 5th one was boring, and the 6th was an all-round turkey. So this is the best in the DTV sequels for COTC. The best scene in this movie, is when the two old ladies explain the life of the preacher boy Josiah, the camera effects are really good and it leaves you scared. There really isn't a whole lot more other then if you watch just one of them DTV sequels, pick this one. The writers actually thought for a change.

And get used to it &#x96; because this will be the 1st of at least 183 dream sequences this movie has.Unfortunately my beloved Gatlin is nowhere to be found as they have set this movie in another fictional Nebraska town with rows of cornfields. Not that much time is spent in the corn seeing as everyone is too busy sleeping and having dreams.A bored young woman named Grace comes home to NOT Gatlin to help take care of her nut bar mother and her much, much younger siblings and to look and seem bored. Soon after the kids get high temperatures and start becoming reincarnations of kids from way back. Or so I assume, it was easy to fade in and out of this movie. Bored Grace teams up with what's his face and they attempt to save the freaking day. Kudos to Grace for still managing to look bored even when faced with dead bodies and mortal peril. It's her thing and she's sticking with it.One thing I love with the Children of the Corn series is that each movie comes up with completely different explanations for why the kids go crazy and He Who Walks behind the Rows. So far everything from Indian legend to Satan to child abuse and the black arts has been used, with this we have an origin story of a boy preacher in 1800's who was forced to stay young otherwise Coca Cola would take away his sponsorship. Faced with this horrifying aspect he turned eeeeeeevil and......*YAWWWWWN* I'm over it.After a few more dream sequences and a few scenes of Grace turning up and looking bored, the movie thankfully ends; I didn't even have a favourite death. That makes me sad. I'm going to have to go watch Friday the 13th part 8 &#x96; Jason Takes Manhattan to make myself feel better.Oh yea and Grace's sister turns out to be her daughter.

It's based on the idea of Children of the Corn, but doesn't follow the events of the first three films. It features the Rhoades family. Every night June Rhoades has the same nightmare a kid coming to her door, showing her he's wounded, and when she returns with first aid, the kid turns into a hideous looking thing. Luckily, help was on the way.          June's daughter Grace was visiting from medical school.She visited her younger siblings, James and Margaret. But what they didn't expect, was the spirit of child preacher Josiah, was planning to recruit children to do his evil bidding. So he summoned them all. It all began with an outbreak of fevers. Next, the children claimed they were different people. They also started doing very odd things, for example one night as the Atkins family was getting ready to move away, son Marcus murdered his mother. Poor father Donald was blamed. Marcus disappeared after that.           Donald met up with Grace one afternoon and forced her to go with him to some friends of his, which I don't think was right. Just as Grace was about to take Margaret to the doctor's house, Donald shows up with a shotgun, tells her to leave Margaret and take him someplace. Despite the fact Donald was only trying to be helpful, you still don't point guns at people. But anyway, they travel to the home of Jane and Rosa, two elderly ladies to tell the tale of Josiah and what he's after, so Grace and Donald race off to find the children, who had gathered at an old farm. One child would have to be sacrificed for Josiah. That child would be Margaret. Quicksilver would stop Josiah, so while Donald caught Marcus and helped him, Grace defeated Josiah and saved Margaret just in time. So our story has a happy ending, poor June Rhoades doesn't make it. Is this movie as good as the first three? I guess so. Part 5 is pretty OK, it isn't great. Six sucked! And seven, don't bother seeing that, but if you have seen the first three Children of the Corns, you might as well see four. It doesn't really follow the first three. It doesn't even take place in Gatlin. It's in another little town in Nebraska.

I saw this year's ago and decided to revisit it. Please forgive me. Totally dismissing part three's open ending, the filmmakers set this one in a small Midwestern town with a kid-to-parent ratio of, let's say, twenty to one. When a young girl (Naomi Watts, who hasn't done anything noteworthy since this...ha!) returns to look after her ill mother, things start to go wrong. A ghost boy that lives in a well begins to slowly seize the minds of the town's children. Overcome with boiling fevers, the children eventually turn into bloodthirsty cob gobblers. You can guess where this all goes, right?While watching COTCIV, a rather intoxicated friend quipped, Well, I see children and I see corn and that's about it. I couldn't have said it better. Bearing no connection to the other films other than those facts, this is just another mid-90s shameless Weinsteins direct-to-video victory parade to cash in on Stephen King's name and any semi-successful property they owned. I seriously suggest King starts spinning now because he is going to be doing it eternally once he is seven feet under. There is some decent Sam Raimi-esquire camera work and the film is surprisingly gory. But can't make up for ridiculous bits like a Sheriff following a kid into a spooky cornfield in the middle of the night. Let him rot in there with the scarecrows! It is past his bedtime anyway. Director Greg Spence also puked out THE PROPHECY II for Miramax/Dimension before deciding to end his career as a helmer (he recently was associate producer on HBO's JOHN ADAMS; I'm waiting for Spence to announce JOHN ADAMS II THE RECKONING.) I quit the series cold turkey after this one.

Part two, three, four or five...what's the difference? When you've seen one, you've seen them all. This fourth entry is bearable, but only thanks to the starring of Karen Black and a young Naomi Watts who plays the lead-role. The premise here has got nothing to do anymore with the original Corn-movie and introduces a 'new' type of spiritual evil that takes over the minds of young children in an offbeat Nebraska town. Grace takes a break from university to look after her ill mother at home but she soon discovers that pretty much everyone in town has issues. Especially the children, who all get feverish together and take over the personalities of kids that lived in town 60 years earlier. The script of this straight-to-video production is a giant mess and the substance is far too ridiculous to evoke any scares or atmosphere. The plot actually hasn't got anything to do with corn or cornfields so it's clear that the makers exclusively used the name to make their marketing campaigns easier. There's only one reason to check out this film and that is &#150; of course &#150; the gore! We witness a couple of very gruesome deaths here, committed with typical farmer tools like shovels, pitchforks and (yay!) scythes!

The town's children come down with a mysterious virus and soon they are killing adults apparently with the possessed soul of a boy who died fifty-years earlier. Normally you'd expect the fourth film in a rather mediocre series to be the pits but that's not the case here as we have a fairly good story brought to life with some nice acting and good direction. Watts steals the film as she manages to make her character very believable and shows a good strength, which allows her to carry the movie without any problems. Black is pretty much being Black as she plays the weirdo but who better to do that than her? I was also impressed with Brent Jennings as a father accused of killing him wife and William Windom as the local doctor. The actual story, as with the previous two entries, is far away from King's original short story but that might not be such a bad thing. This entry also contains some of the most brutal killings, which leads to all types of gore. One scene has a farmer getting all the equipment used to rip him apart and the every loving scythes. The red stuff is constantly pouring but it never gets in the way of the story, which believe it or not, is trying to be told here.

The movie however then turns South pretty fast when so much ridicules is happening that you just start to loose interest. It's first halve was still mainly build-up, it's too bad that the pay off was not halve as good however.None of the Children of the Corn movies have a real believable concept or story of course. The whole idea behind the movies is pretty tiresome but at least some of them still have some good horror moments in it. Fans of the genre shall therefore still somewhat enjoy this movie as well. The movie is being pretty good with its horror, which makes it all the more too bad that too little is actually happening in the movie, due to the fact that it just doesn't have a very good pay off, after its fine build up. You still feel that director Greg Spence understands the genre, so lets hope he'll do something good with it some day. The previous entry in the series had Charlize Theron in it, in her very first movie role. Her role was about 15 seconds long however. This movie has Naomi Watts in it before she got famous. And yes, her role is much bigger. She actually is the main lead of the movie and she shows her talents. She makes her character a good one, while basically ever other young actress would had turned the characters into an annoying, helpless young adult, like you'll see in so many other genre movies like this. It also has Karen Black in it, who perhaps should had got a bit of a bigger role in the movie. There was plenty of room for it but for some reason they decided not to give her more to do in the movie.It's a pretty well made and good looking movie, though you'll probably start to loose interest fast once the second halve of it kicks in.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}]
