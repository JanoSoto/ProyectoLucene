Despite the fanciful story that Borden Chase wrote here about how the service was founded, the Seabees were actually an idea already thought of by Admiral Ben Morreell the Chief of Navy Supply even before Pearl Harbor. Unlike the war in Europe where the Allies would be looking to take an hold cities with facilities already there, like air fields for example, those planning the war in the Pacific knew that they would be starting from scratch. Airfields, fuel depots, etc. would have to be constructed on jungle islands in the Pacific. So the idea of a separate service for the construction trade was born.Now that we know that the plot of The Fighting Seabees is so much hogwash, let me say that what the film does do very well is show the hazards of what the men in that service faced. Trying to build facilities at the same time as the enemy is firing on them. The scenario in this film is repeated many times over on the islands of the Pacific.As to the story of this film, John Wayne reverses roles here. In most of his war films he's usually the professional military man, here he's the tough, but inpatient civilian who never seems to learn the value of military discipline. Of course being this is the Duke, he does redeem himself in the end in a spectacular manner.A love triangle is tossed in here, rather unnecessarily in my opinion, a straightforward account of Seabee heroism would have been sufficient. Wayne and Navy Commander Dennis O'Keefe are both interested in war correspondent Susan Hayward. This was Hayward's second film with John Wayne, who along with Clark Gable, and Dean Martin, she once described as her three favorite leading men. Her big scene is when she's wounded and thinks she's cashing in, she declares her love for the Duke. Susan Hayward has always been a favorite of mine, but it's on the strength of her performances in her starring roles in the Fifties, not as the sex object in The Fighting Seabees.The Fighting Seabees isn't one of the Duke's top 10 or even top 20, but it's a decent enough film to sit through even with the World War II heroic bravado that was obligatory at the time this was made. You even get to see John Wayne attempt the jitterbug. During that scene, the Duke looks mighty uncomfortable. He was never going to compete with Fred Astaire for roles.

The people that made these didn't have the luxury of crafting meticulous stories and memorable characters; most of the movies had been contracted by the government and had to be turned out QUICKLY. Movies like The Fighting Seabees were made for one reason alone as propaganda pieces designed to bolster public support for our fighting men overseas. As such, they were an important part of the war effort, and helped ensure that fifty years later, we'd have the luxury of sitting at our computers and hashing about their qualities as movies.With all that in mind, The Flying Seabees is really pretty good.

He insisted that the only aspects of this movie that had any basis in fact were that the Seabees actually did recruit professional engineers and construction workers, that many of them were considerably older than other service men, that they were occasionally called upon to defend themselves, and that they really could build anything. In his day the Seabees did not yet have their own training facilities, so they did their basic military training not with the Navy but with the Marines. The way to tell the difference between a Marine base and a Seabase base was that the Marines were all 18 years old and lived in pup tents, while the Seabees were mostly in their forties and fifties and their encampments always had heat, hot and cold running water, washing machines, shower facilities, stills, and all the other comforts of home, all of which the Seabees manufactured themselves in their spare time.

With some added drama along the way, this movie demonstrates some of the work done by the SeaBees - building facilities & runways on remote islands during WWII; massive runway construction with PSP grid materials, bulldozing, & hut construction, which were all representative of the basics that needed accomplishing during this campaign. This was a refreshing viewing experience in that the then media was supportive of the American fighting man, and while this may make some in today's culture wince, that's their problem. Today's warriors and sailors are just as honorable & deserving of the kind of support that surrounds this kind of movie, and watching this production reminds you of that fact.

With the release of THE FIGHTING SEABEES (Republic Pictures, 1945) not only filled the bill, but also turned out to be one of the finest movies to come out of that studio.BEING the Studio which had the (deserved) reputation of producing mostly attractions for the Saturday Matinée crowd; these of course being mainly the B Western Series and the Serials;Republic did such titles as THE RED PONY, SANDS OF IWO JIMA and THE QUIET MAN;all A Films.IN addition to those listed above, we must add what is today's analyzed specimen, the screen story of the Naval Construction Battalion, much better known as THE FIGHTING SEABEES. Although it was produced in time for a 1945 release, it still packed a punch with the morale of the Armed Forces; as well as that of those at home.SENSING that they had a very important story to tell, the Production Team set out to Bulk up the headliners of the cast. First of all they needed a male lead. They wanted someone who would have had experience in both the dramatic vein and in the action genre. He would have to be a 100% red blooded American Male. Well, the Republic Brain trust didn't have to look very far at all; for among their Contract Players one True Movie Star who would fit the bill to an absolute degree. Gee, I wonder just who that would be? ONE would certainly not have to be a film buff to come up with the answer in John Wayne.DUKE had put in a lot of time and paid his dues with a long stint as the featured player in that series of Lone Star Western Productions, which of course was a subsidiary of Monogram Pictures. Mr. Wayne later signed on with Republic, where he was cast as the lead in their THREE MESKITEERS Western Series. More importantly, it was during this period that he was lent out to just about every studio for some movie or other. In one of his loan-outs, Director John Ford borrowed his services from Republic for the male lead in STAGECOACH (Walter Wanger Productions/United Artists, 1939) It gave a big boost to Duke's value and her saw his stock go sky high.WORKING for about all of the other Studios in various types of roles (mostly those of a Man of Action of some sort or another), Wayne's name and reputation grew considerably. So for this time at least, there would be no going to 20th Century-Fox, Universal, Paramount or MGM for a starring role in a major motion picture. Duke would have only to stay on the Republic lot.COSTARS for the production were a pair of most capable and popular Actors. Second lead went to Dennis O'Keefe, who while never ascending to the heights of Star, nonetheless had been most successful in many a lesser movie and as a capable, likable of a Second Lead. His casting proved to be well done as he and Wayne performed very well together, having several great scenes together.ADDITION of Miss Susan Hayward, on loan from 20th Century-Fox (?) to the cast gave the film a great balance on the top of the bill. The insertion of her character (or any lovely lady) into the story would almost always be cause for an example of the Eternal Triangle. And so it was; but this was Wartime and it would be handled in such a way as to remind all that this was a time of sorrow and self-sacrifice.REPIUBLIC spared no expense in adding to the cast in a great number of tried and true character actors in supporting roles. The task was accomplished with the employ of such names as William Frawley (Fred Mertz and 'Bub', later on TV), Grant Withers, Chief Thundercloud, J.M. Kerrigan, Leonid Kinskey, Paul Fix (Mica), Ben Welden and many others.WHILE Republic gave THE FIGHTING SEABEES a much larger budget than most, they still got their money's worth in every respect; for while the movie called for a great deal more outdoor shooting on location than most any other of what they usually made in their Westerns and Serials. Their remedy was to stick to what they always did the best; that being to put their 'Thrill Factory Assembly Line into working on the production.THIS meant that they merely went to doing what they did best. They could use some of their own stock scenes of explosions, floods, fires and volcanic eruptions in movie after movie, without any adverse effect. These were always convincing and had served them well for years in lesser films.THE reason because of their great Special Effects department, the scenes of train & airplane crashes or what have you, were done by the best guys in the business; being the Brothers Lydecker, Howard and Theodore. Their work was as fine as any in Hollywood and much better than in most cases. Even the 'Big 5' Studios of MGM, Paramount, 20th Century-Fox, RKO Radio and Warner Brothers all looked covetously at Republic's Special Effects team.OUR STORY&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;Following the events of December 7, 1941 the need to have an all military construction unit; as the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces had no respect for unarmed civilian workers who were employed in building air strips, military compounds, etc., all throughout the Philippines and other locales in the South Pacific, They waste not a frame of film in giving background, the problems and the solution.POUND for pound or rather frame for frame, we can't think of a better example of a great World War II Movie, BAR NONE!

John Wayne portrays the hot headed owner of Donovan Construction Company, who offers his services to the government in building airfields and related support fortifications for the war effort. The story centers on Wedge Donovan's single mindedness in getting his men armed so they can defend themselves under attack; as civilians they have no such authority. Boiled down, Wayne's role was to make a lot of foolish mistakes that got many of his men killed, both out of uniform and as soldiers.Complicating matters for Donovan is a three way love triangle supplied by reporter Connie Chesley (Susan Hayward) and her fiancé Lieutenant Commander Robert Yarrow (Dennis O'Keefe). When Connie suffers a near fatal wound following a Japanese invasion of Island X-371, Yarrow overhears Donovan and Chesley exchanging I Love You's together. Ever the stalwart military man, Yarrow doesn't seem to take it personally, even as he continues to pine for his woman.The fight scenes offer some unique twists that one would not expect. As Japanese tanks advance on the island, the Seabees combine ingenuity with resolve by battling the enemy with bulldozers and cranes. The surreal nature of the exchange makes one wonder if such fighting actually could have taken place, though I imagine it would have been possible.Only John Wayne could go into battle without a weapon, and in seconds take out three attacking Japanese while securing a rifle in the process. It comes as a surprise then when his character dies on the battlefield, first shot and then blown up by enemy fire. Most of his men suffer the same fate, a colorful supporting cast that includes William Frawley, Leonid Kinskey, Grant Withers, Paul Fix and Ben Welden.With no sense of a time dimension for the history of the Seabees, and a hit and run approach to the Wayne/Hayward/O'Keefe romance, the movie has a disjointed feel and is best approached as an entertainment piece and not a serious exploration of it's subject matter. The film closes on an appropriately patriotic note, with Commander Yarrow reading a presidential citation for the heroes of X-371. The movie's theme is formalized with the line - We build for the fighters, we fight for what we build.

I love the battle scenes with him on a bulldozer blasting Japs, its an American icon for me. I just started watching some of it sans thirty plus years later on TCM and it is sooooo stupid I just had to comment on it here. I'm actually thinking of the real life civilians that were captured on Wake Island and their horrific life and execution in Jap captivity, that movie is totally unwatchable for me after I learned of those facts. Anyway, I was attached in real life shortly with Seabees waiting for my next assignment and I was making sandbags and painting old shacks, thats the real Seabees. That and talking with some whose unit were killed while in morning formation in the middle east, some of whom went on door to door combat missions with Marines. The Seabees are quasi ground troops for the Navy, with skills that are necessary to establish beachheads and airfields and ports. They do a hard unglamourous job, but they do have a great cohesion among themselves and I'm sure they are proud to have the name Seabee, no doubt in part to being associated with this John Wayne comic book tale and that great fight song that you hear in the beginning (and that cool bee mascot with the machine gun). The movie is great for kids maybe like it was for me but wont stand for anyone now other than war movie junkies. When they are on island X something the whole combat compliment is Navy, where were the Marines?

The current packaging for this 1944 film emphasizes the widely known fact that our U.S. War Department censors dictated every thought, word, and deed presented on screen by American movie studios from 1942 through 1945--especially the current event war dramas intended to boost morale on the Front Lines, as well as on the Home Front. The idea that America's Enemy in the South Pacific is some sort of sub-human creature (not unlike the Orcs in J.R.R.

A less flattering picture emerges from Gary Wills JOHN WAYNE'S America THE POLITICS OF CELEBRITY in which evidence seems to indicate that Wayne (who was no physical coward by any stretch of the imagination) made a complex decision based on his growing stature in the film industry, his value as a propaganda symbol, his increasing paycheck, and the fact that he found film-making so rewarding. Whether an outside observer finds this an appealing portrait or not, there is ample evidence to suggest that Wayne always regretted thereafter not having served on active duty.

Davidson, How did I get into the Seabees? I was BORN! In December of 1954, I was born in the Port Hueneme SeaBee Hospital. I was too young to remember, though. My Father was stationed at Point Mugu in Naval Aviation. We lived in Oxnard at the time. I have seen the movie, I just can't remember it. I saw one entry from the son of a SeaBee who said his Father called the movie rubbish. You have to understand, if it were completely factual, 99% of it would be boring to the point of tears. Another entry from a Viet Nam SeaBee (thanks for your service and work, my friend!) said it was about as factual as you can get. Who's to say? Anybody wanting to really know, JOIN! I delayed-entered the U.S. Army as a mechanic (52B20) and was in basic training 2 weeks after high school graduation. Looking back, had I known better, I was more cut out to be a SeaBee. The Army was a joke (at least at Giebelstadt Air Base in West Germany in 1975) We would have continuous guard duty but were not issued any ammo for our M16. Huh? No ammo? Now, THAT'S a joke! Of course before Germany, I was stationed at Fort Sill, OK. (14th. Aviation Battalion) and it was beautiful! No guard duty and the brass was very professional. I heard John Wayne could not serve due to his bad back. His macho-like walk was not macho. His back just hurt like hell!

Full of overblown heroics and racist name calling. I see lots of reviews saying movies like this were a product of their time. Well so were the propaganda movies the Nazis and the Japanese were putting out but I don't see anyone say what good films they were. Propaganda isn't just to bolster moral it's also supposed to engender hatred and demonize the enemy. It's OK to kill them because they are hateful and inhuman. Their soldiers don't have loved ones like ours they're just meat bags who deserve to die. We have wars today but nobody in their right mind would try to portray them as movies like this one and others of it's ilk does. People are far too sophisticated to buy this war is glorious rubbish. If it proves anything it's that people back then must have been pretty gullible to buy such nonsense as the true face of war.

How many times is his character Donovan going to make the same mistake? This highly fictionalized account of the birth of the Seabees does little to inform OR entertain. I know that the war in the Pacific was still raging in 1944 when this was filmed but the constant stereotypes became tiresome very quickly. Every shot of Japanese fighters showed them as grinning baboons. The construction workers were all shown as drunks or incompetents. The love triangle was never believable and the misogynistic treatment of Susan Hayward was laughable as she was alternately treated like baggage or acted like a lapdog. Still, Susan Hayward was a bright spot in this picture if only for her occasional glimpse of potential as an actualized professional woman and her undeniable attractiveness.View if you must but don't expect any great (or even small) expositions about Seabees, war or love. This was a badly made propaganda film that should have been retired in 1946 when we didn't need to sign-on anymore Seabees to finish WWII. No doubt John Wayne was trying to do his patriotic duty by making this call-to-arms/shovels biopic but it misses on every cylinder to a modern viewer. There are too many decent WWII era films available to waste your time on this dog.

The other nine are not seen that often on TV---but people cannot believe that The Duke even died or was killed in any of His movies. The list contains both westerns & action movies from almost all decades. 40s--50s--60s & 70s. The list includes The Wake Of The Red Witch, Sands of Iwo Jima, The Cowboys, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Shootist, The Alamo, Reap The Wild Wind. It is widely know of a story which was told By a person who was there on the Tonight Show of the night that a man bragged of making Wayne back down in a Hotel lobby that He & Wayne were staying at while filming a Movie. A film crew member heard the boast & went too Wayne's room too inform him of the mans claim. Wayne walked up behind the man & In His most recognisable voice said I Hear You Made Me Back Down From A Fight Pilgrim--at which the man passed out in shock.

Yates product that everyone went to see during the war years. John Wayne, looking youngish and handsome, is Wedge Donovan, head of a civilian construction company whose workers include such familiar faces as Paul Fix, J. M. Kerrigan, and Fred Mertz -- I mean William Frawley. The roustabouts all work hard, drink hard, and get into brawls.Wayne's labor force is working on a Pacific island occupied by the U.S. Navy, mainly in the person of LTCDR Yarrow, Dennis O'Keefe, when they are attacked by Japanese aircraft and three of the men are killed. This raises John Wayne's hackles, and that, as usual, turns out to be a bad idea, especially for Wayne. He and his men grab guns and rush into the middle of an ambush the Navy has set for a Japanese landing. Wayne's impetuosity breaks up the trap and results in further deaths for his men.O'Keefe persuades Wayne and his men to join the Navy and become part of a new type of unit -- construction battalions, or CBs, or SeaBees. Now they're trained in military protocol, tactics, and the handling of arms, though their principal job remains the construction of airfields and other facilities near the front lines. If the script didn't spell this out for us, we'd get it anyway because of the patriotic chorus on the sound track -- We build to fight and fight for what we build; We're SeaBees of the Navy! O'Keefe is promoted to Commander and Wayne receives a commission as Lieutenant Commander. The Worker SeaBees remain swabs.Well! The NEXT time the Japs pull a landing, things turn out differently, I can tell you, although the SeaBees are outnumbered. Heroism abounds. And this time our side wins.John Wayne makes the ultimate sacrifice but it's a splendid one. He's shot dead while driving a bull dozer towards a huge oil tank. The dozer's blade cuts into the tank, the oil blossoms into a colossal explosion, and the ocean of flame cascades down upon the screaming, stereotypical monkeys below.Oh, did I mention that Susan Hayward is in this as a reporter? Well, a love interest really. Both O'Keefe and Wayne are in love with her. It's easy to understand why. She's young, fresh faced, with a wide expanse of forehead and a cutely upturned nose. Keeps the distaff side of the audience entertained. She's in love with both men and can't make up her mind. In the end, she decides she loves the gallant O'Keefe, perhaps because he's survived the battle while Wayne did not.It's a modest and engaging movie, a twin narrative of Wayne's integration into the disciplined life of the Navy and of the love triangle involving O'Keefe, Wayne, and Hayward. There's nothing in the least original or poetic about it. But if you're looking for a fast, exciting movie about a seldom-noticed unit of the Navy, this gets the job done. A bonus is that you get to see the massive bulk of John Wayne jitterbugging with a supple little girl.

You will laugh at the subhuman portrayals of the little yellow men especially in the two-man tanks, unless you're Japanese of course.  Lot's of simple minded expressions and some buck teeth.  It makes you want to see them killed!Basically, any movie with John Wayne is appealing.  The man simply commands respect, and the women always love him, especially Susan Hayward who's a doll.  Love and War; Usually the best themes for big pictures.

Still, considering that it was released during the course of World War II , it's fairly justified.There is plenty of action including impressive hand-to-hand combat and firefight engagements; surprisingly, the Japanese two-man tanks employed against the Seabees (Construction Battalion)towards the climax definitely resembled the Imperial Japanese Army Type 94 tankettes (wonder how Republic Pictures pulled that one off)! Aside from the combat sequences, however, the corniness and simple, gung-ho dialect, not to mention that trite, Hollywoodesque love triangle gig sends one spiraling. And portraying the Japanese as the quintessential bug-toothed, eye-squinting, bespectacled subhumans constituted a complete turnoff (the profound racial overtones of those days never cease to amaze me; yes, they were our enemies - but what about the stereotypes about Black-Americans and Hispanics?). Frankly, the Japanese are an attractive people, and clearly those extras inside the tanks were N O T...(I had read in some movie book that they were hired from LA' s Chinatown). In any event, if you're ever in the mood for an ordinary World War II flick just for the action, then The Fighting Seabees could very well be a candidate; just for the action, nothing else!!
