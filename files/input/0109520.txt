Though it was horrible it was hilarious and very cocky. I'm sure all of us would break into this song after beating everyone in the world in hockey....though it's hard to believe Canada didn't kick Americas asses. I am a fan of Queen also and I believe this movie may have had a great deal with that as well.As a girl I have to say that when I was ten this was the first movie that I saw boys for more than just stupid pricks.

D2 is the rarest of sequels, a sequel that is truly better than the original.  All of the jagged edges in the original film's plot have been streamlined, and the new ground being broken, (Self-Doubt, Conquering your fears, Sexual Identity) fit in seamlessly, giving this film a more robust feel, similar to that of Chunky Soup.  Emilio Estevez (In his star-making role) plays coach Bombay with a smoldering fury that makes it very clear that he is Martin Sheen's favorite son.  The rest of the cast is equally brilliant, especially the ducks themselves, whose performances are so real, you cant help believing that they are truly kids.  The direction is bold yet beautiful, and instantly recalls that of the early german surrealists.  The electronic score by Goblin is eerily effective in creating suspense in both the game and locker room scenes, and lets the viewer know that this isnt a game anymore, and that national pride is on the line.  A masterpiece of baroque visuals and dry wit, D2 is a most worthy rental upon your next excursion to the video store.

D2 The Mighty Ducks is a circus; a cacophony of conflicts, dopey characters, fighting, eccentricities, miscommunications, clichés, and inpenetrable goofiness. Here's a movie sequel that continues to beat a dead horse into the ground by offering the public a sequel to a Disney movie that can only be liked by reciting the word nostalgia or nostalgic. At this point, it isn't that The Mighty Ducks films are bad movies in the usual sense, but it's that they are so unambitious, uninspired, and bland that it makes it hard to accept them as take it for what it is entertainment and harder to like them on the typical good movie level. Emilio Estevez, still portraying the greatly motivated man driven on the idea of success, reprises his role as Gordon Bombay, who the opening credits show us has gone on to be a minor league hockey player being seriously considered for his first NHL appearance until he injured during a breakneck game.Now, Bombay's chances are done and he talks to a close friend about making money, until opportunity knocks when the idea of him coaching Team U.S.A.'s hockey team in the Junior Goodwill Games is proposed. Bombay quickly signs a suit's contract, bands the Ducks together again, and they quickly rustle up the skills and the motivation to win at this year's event and show audiences that Ducks stick together.Need I go further? Should I mention that the kids are now teenagers, yet are still as brazen and as goofy as they were in the first film? Should I go on to mention that Bombay becomes too consumed with coaching a more honored and admired team, and lets all the pressure gets to his head to the point where he is scolding and yelling at his players? Ned I mention that this newfound consumption on Bombay's part has greatly upset a number of players, fueling Ducks-heckler Russ Tyler (Kenan Thompson) to aggravate the players? And do I even need to mention that in the third act the Ducks will discover Tyler's surefire knucklepuck and graciously adopt him to the team? One can also make note of the never-ending barrage of one-liners the film haphazardly includes in order to sound hip, motivating, and high-spirited. When one of the only girl players is called a lady, she forcefully replies, I'm no lady, I'm a duck! And when the Ducks face their opponents from Iceland, the crowd chants, We will, we will quack you! in attempt to see how much the audience can cringe in a small period of time.This is kids sports movie-making 101, although it's not harmful as much as it is non-beneficial to any of its viewers. It provides sweet, genial escapist delight and I believe that's what a number of Disney-movie fans seek, which in that case, renders D2 The Mighty Ducks a success according to them. To me, the film is overly long and winded, still far to content with capitalizing on the surprise success of its predecessor, is chock full of clichés, and anchored by its dull characters and formulaic premises. I guess you can also say I'm getting tired of hearing We are the Champions at the end of the picture further capitalizing on the in-game spirit. At least the film knows one thing and that's how to properly utilize Estevez.Starring Emilio Estevez, Joshua Jackson, Michael Tucker, and Kenan Thompson. Directed by Sam Weisman.

This movie makes no sense. Despite that, it's still a guilty pleasure watch of mine.","Date":"16 March 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" As a kid of the 1990s, 'The Mighty Ducks' trilogy (1992-1996) was one of my favorite sport movies at the time. It's the movie that got me, interested in hockey. It had a very positive message about teamwork, sportsmanship and overcoming adversity. However, the sequel to the first movie does have the most faults, out of the three. It's something I can't overlook. Directed by Sam Weisman, the movie has Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) returning from the minor leagues after a major knee injury forced him out. While rehabbing he is offered the role as coach of Team USA in an international hockey tournament known as the Jr. Goodwill Games. With that job, comes with him, reuniting with his old Pee-Wee Hockey Team, the Mighty Ducks, as well as a few new players in tow. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I was somewhat disappointing, when this movie came out, because the fact that the Mighty Ducks wasn't going to defend their Pee-Wee Hockey title. After all, I kinda love, the Hawks Vs Ducks rivalry. Still, I did like the new idea of them, playing in a Junior Olympic type settling. It made the games, a lot more challenging, despite D2 follows the same formula as its predecessor. Also, the fact that Team USA is made out of the majority of the Mighty Ducks team, seem very illogical. First off, the team were so bad at hockey in the first movie, that they only made their local hockey playoffs, because another team got the measles. That's doesn't make them, the best junior hockey players the United States has to offer, at all. Also, wouldn't the Ducks need a couple of more wins under their belt, be needed to even, be consider to represented their countries!? One big win doesn't make you, the best. Even Bombay as the coach makes little sense. He has been an amateur coach at a junior level for a single season of local pee-wee hockey. Before that, he was a lawyer. It's not like he was a seasoned coach or player. Also, he was mostly drunk when he coached the Ducks in the first movie. So, how is that, make great coaching!? The fact, that he spent most of the movie, eating up fame, doesn't make it, any better. I think the worst, had to be his roster management. I don't get, why benching all-star goalie named Julie The Cat Gaffney (Colombe Jacobsen) for the horrible goalie, Greg Goldberg (Shaun Weiss) is a good idea!? Doesn't Goldberg hate being the goalie? Also, what are the rules of this league? How come the other teams, are all males with a single ethnic or social background, but the Mighty Ducks is the only one that has female players and players with different ethnic background? It's very weird. Also, it seem like anybody can join the team, even after the sporting events, happen. A good example of this, is how Russ Tyler (Kenan Thompson) is able to join the team, with little to no previous ice hockey experience. Wouldn't the Jr. Goodwill Games committee board, up against that? It's seem like they don't really care for any the rules, if they willing to have players take off their mask, switch uniforms and hog-tie other players without getting ejected from the game. The Ducks don't even get major penalties. Just a 2 minute minor. I really don't get, how Jr. Goodwill Games would allow this to happen. Also, why would anybody cheer Team USA when they become the Mighty Ducks in the end? For most of the fans, the name, the Ducks is totally meaningless to them. If anything, they would be Disqualification for the second half, due to the name change. Even with that, Team USA is not the underdogs in the film. In my opinion, Coach Bombay should be coaching, the Trinidad and Tobago team; a country team that doesn't have snow-like weather nor let alone, an ice rink. Add to the fact; that they are playing in a different country, during the summer months. That team seem to be more like the underdog than the other teams in the film, due to them, being a Caribbean team. Who knows, maybe if they did that, this movie would be a little more memorable, like 1993's 'Cool Runnings', which was about the Jamaican bobsled team, during the Winter Olympics. Instead, Team USA looks like jerks, by completely destroying them; not only with scores, but physically, injuring their players. Despite all that, the movie does have some good highlights. The comedy was mostly a hit than a miss to me. All of the recurring and new characters were great in their roles, even if some of them, were just one-dimensional stereotypes. The hockey scenes were intense, and fun to watch. Even the music by composer, J. A. C. Redford was inspiration. Overall All this commercial success paved the way for the creation of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, (now the Anaheim Ducks) NHL team as well as a unrelated animated series called 'Mighty Ducks' (1996-1997). While, the sequel is the most cheesy movie of the three films. D2 is still reasonably entertaining. It's a fun nostalgia trip. Recommended to anybody who is a fan of 1990s kid sport movies.

The third is a complete letdown. I loved this one as a kid. Now, I can see how unrealistic it is and kind of dull. That said, it is the best of the three, and at least watchable. It teaches kids about teamwork, and does have a good plot. A lot of interesting moments that are very predictable, but it leads to a happy ending.For a kids sports movie, this is worthwhile. No classic that has stood the test of time, but was good for it's time in the mid-90's when hockey seemed to be more popular nationwide. Worth watching if you have kids to share with who like sports, or if it's on TV and you have nothing better to do on a rainy day.

The whole Kenan thread was a bit ridiculous - I'm not sure you can add a player mid-Olympics, even the junior Olympics, but even if you could, has he ever ice-skated in his life? Maybe, but it's never even asked - but the only big problem I had with the thing was the stupid knuckle-puck. As a hockey fan, it was a moronic addition that would've been best left on the cutting room floor. Even with the ludicrous nature of the movie, this was a little bit out there. Much, much worse, however, was the giant disaster that was Gordon Bombay's coaching. First of all, he got a big head coaching a junior USA hockey team that had trouble winning a tournament without Canada (and I don't remember Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, or the Czech. Republic being represented either), so it was such an easy schedule that they should have swept, but they lost a few games and had trouble with freakin' Iceland in the finals. Weak. Here's a suggestion, you sexist blowhard play your best goalie. I don't care that she's a woman, WHY WAS JULIE SITTING IN FAVOR OF GOLDBERG!?!? Goldberg didn't even practice in the offseason. He obviously was the goalie because he was the fattest kid on the team, not the best choice as a goalie. Now, that's fine last year, when it's just a regional thing meant to be fun and teach sportsmanship, but you're in the big leagues now (said/written mostly tongue-in-cheek), you have to play your best goalie, which was clearly Julie The Cat. My buddy and I were talking about this, and agreed that the secret weapon status is exclusively the domain of a one-trick-pony type. In that case, Knuckle-puck Kenan could've been a nice option if you really wanted a secret weapon. (I almost titled this review D2 Review for the rhyming, but decided on the alliteration instead. I think I made the right choice.)

I play hockey and its very hard to watch, numerous rules being broke, and the constant equipment changes.   Equipment costs a lot of money, and they all have new pieces of equipment in every game or practice sequence, like new helmets, gloves, breezers, not to mention all the goalie equipment helmets, leg pads and all, at least three different sets (6 for both goalies). *Note all equipment was oversized as well, the helmets should be snug, plus the straps would have to be fastened, you're not allowed to play if they are undone.  Plus their opponents shouldn't even be in the same talent/skill level (like A, B, or C) let alone AGE bracket, besides the fact that they don't have any girls on the other teams.      The refs miss calls that even a non-hockey fan could catch.  The penalty shot (shoot out) was already mentioned.   And the Switching numbers mentioned switching jerseys would not be allowed. A goalie with out a mask, the play is whistled down, the time it would take to take off and put on the goalie pads when they switched players. Goalies in the lower levels are not allowed to cross the Blue line. Sorry this movie is So FLAWED its hard to watch!!!!

One reason and probably the main reason is that it really ignores the first movie. Sure, at the end of the original, Gordon is heading to the minors and at the beginning of this one, he is hurt in the minors...and sure they've still got players from the original movie, but it's strange that they're missing half the first team and that the guys are suddenly a lot older.Also, it's unrealistic that just because someone wins a pee-wee championship, he is asked to coach at the Junior Goodwill Games. And also, why do the Ducks play so pitiful in comparison to their new counterparts.But still, this movie is full of hockey fun, and through it all, it's worth the time spent watching it. Watch for cameos of nearly every sportsman imaginable.**1/2 out of **** "},{"Title":"Average Movie","Date":"2 January 1999","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":"  D2 The Mighty Ducks is just another formulaic teamwork-to-triumph family film.  It has a moderately good script and storyline and is reasonably well filmed.Although better than the first Mighty Ducks, it is still inferior to the third movie.When rated up against other Disney films, it rates an 8/10. Up against other non-Disney films more like 6/10Overall an enjoyable movie for the kids or the older kids-at-heart.

From Coach Bombays silky slick hair to the hot goaltender; this film oozes Disney, but provides something for everyone. Speaking from an adult point of view, the inability to lose itself from the roots of the first film speaks volumes for the charm of the mighty ducks series. Joshua Jackson performs in a more mature role, allowing Goldberg and the bash brothers to take centre stage.Its a dark story line, with the cool acting by the Iceland outfit is brought into its elements. Yet the colourful theme remains and fun prevails, climaxing in a crescendo of hockey and laughter....And the twist!!! Tarantino himself would have been proud of hiding Kenan Thompson as the tender to perform what became the household catchphrase Knuckle Puck.The only let down was that it didn't last forever.If you cant appreciate the directed genius of Mighty Ducks 2, you don't deserve eyes to enjoy movies.

Let's compare.  First movieDucks?  Why are we the Ducks?  Ducks don't even have teeth!Neither do hockey players.Okay, second movieDid you guys even practice during the off-season?I knew we forgot something!So it's not funny.  And the plot is full, absolutely FULL of holes.  For example, the Ducks lose one game, so apparently the competition is double-elimination.  The team they face for the championship also loses a game, so both of these teams are in the LOSERS BRACKET.  How can they play each other for the championship?Another  I'll buy that by some oversight or loophole there is no rule against switching uniforms in the middle of a game, but switching numbers?!  There is no way in the world even a rec league would allow that, but here, it's essential to the plot.But for all its flaws, I would still say that D2 is, overall, a better movie than the first.  While both are forgettable, the life lessons in the second installment are deeper and less obvious (even to the point of being almost contrived) than in the original film.  But it's nice to see a kids movie show that even innocent actions that seem harmless can cause problems.  That alone makes D2 an above-average sequel.

All the magic from the first Ducks movie was gone. The plot was boring and predictable, there wasn't any funny lines, and you could say that there wasn't anything in the movie that you could use for anything. Actually the movie could be said to give many children a wrongly subjective opinion on many issues.I rate this 1 out of 10, but only because 1 is the lowest, could I give minus points I would.

Every aspect of the story is predictable as the characters re-do Mighty Ducks One, only in a different format/setting.  There is nothing new about the story.  From the players giving up on the coach to the ducks having to make a comeback to eek out the victory,  actions are a repeat of the first movie.  Besides the feeling of deja-vu, the story line is pure insanity.  Also, there is no real hocky footage, like the north star game in the first (oh, wait the stars left town).  Anyway, the series should have stopped with this one as The first movie was good.  However, D3 was made and I refuse to waste my money on it.  Even watching the Minnesota scenes isn't worth the torture.

Emilio Estevez' minor league hockey career comes to a quick close due to injury and he is recruited to coach the U.S. Junior Olympic team at the Goodwill Games in Los Angeles. Naturally we have all the annoying kids back from the original and even a few more are added to the duck stew. The bad guys this time are those cold kids from Iceland (no pun intended). Yawning mess that fans of its predecessor are sure to fly away with, but the rest of us will suffer as usual. Could have been called The Bad News Ducks for more than one reason. 2 stars out of 5.

Sure, it  had its funny moments (the scene in the  clothing store was priceless), this film proved  to be an overly sappy collection of gags and  bad characters. However, the great inconsistency  with this film was the fact that they had a  Junior Summer and WINTER Olympics at  the same time. Anyone want to clarify this  for me? Sadly, the ending also proved to be  rather overdone, even with the new uniforms.  Unfortunately, this didn't prove to be the last  one in the series.

I also think they should try and make a better version of the mighty ducks. and if the newer mighty ducks is in the theater, if I still think it sucks, I will think that just about every hockey games would be bad and such.........
