This painful but quiet life is shattered when the killer follows him to the city and begins a game of cat and mouse with him - sending him a picture of a woman 24 hours before he kills her.  Joel rejoins the police in an effort to save his potential victims as well as catching him.I, like many others, wasn't too bothered by this film when it was released - it looked like it would be yet another serial killer movie, and it was! The plot requires the usual gimmick and here it is the old chestnut of the cop and bad guy needing each other and the killer having a sort of respect and need for his pursuer.  None of the film will surprise you but it still moves forward reasonably quickly without being dull and it is reasonably enjoyable.  The action scenes are not great and the film never really has a real air of menace or tension, but it is still slick enough to watch - even if it is almost impossible to be emotionally involved.The director managed to get his timing right to get Reeves in the midst of a reasonable cast; he shot a few videos for Reeves' band years prior in exchange for Reeves doing this film which, despite hitting it big with The Matrix, was a promise he honoured.  However as a director his music video roots are heavily showing here with far too many flashy visual tricks that stick out from the body of the film and actually take away more than they bring.  However, getting Reeves was worth him having the chair for his star does surprisingly well to step out of his Neo role and into a mean, playful role.  No, he's not doing anything different with it from anyone else who plays this type of serial killer role but he is still charismatic enough to make a difference.  Spader is also pretty good and has more to work with than Reeves, but Tomsei is almost totally wasted with very little to do to justify such a well known actress.  To be honest none of them have much to work with above the norm, but they still add to the film by their names.Overall I did quite enjoy the film but I will be the first to admit that it was nothing new and really didn't do anything different or unusual with the basic premise and material.  The director tries to liven it up a bit with the odd visual trick, but it only serves to make the film look a little desperate to be different.  The end result is an average thriller that has a better than average cast (for this type of thing) and will pass the time without annoying you if you know what to expect.

He literally left his home base in Los Angeles, defeated, because of a particularly hairy case involving an unusually devious, crafty and risk-loving serial killer who went by the name of David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves). The Watcher begins with Campbell resettled in Chicago, trying to put his life back in order. But what will happen when Griffin shows up in the Windy City? This is an unusual film in many ways. Although on one level it's a fairly standard thriller with Reeves playing a subtly twisted baddie, it's really a complex psychological portrait that focuses more on Spader as Campbell.Campbell's life is a mess in Chicago. He can't work and he can barely take care of himself. He looks and feels miserable. His apartment reflects his life--though sparse in content, it's extremely unkempt and unhealthy looking. He is having continual nightmares. He has to inject himself in the stomach with prescription drugs to get over panic attacks and to enable at least a couple hours sleep at night. Of course Campbell is making regular visits to a psychiatrist, Dr. Polly Beilman (Marisa Tomei).He became such a wreck because of being wrapped up so long with the Griffin case. Griffin regularly toyed with Campbell, communicating with him and even giving him clues so that Campbell would be able to almost but not quite beat Griffin to the punch. Amusingly, director Joe Charbanic portrays Griffin as more well adjusted and much more focused than Campbell.As Dr. Beilman discerns, Griffin was Campbell's raison d'etre for so long--almost his sole concern--that abandoning the case resulted in Campbell effectively abandoning his life. Thus Charbanic gives us a clever, ethically gray twist. Griffin may be beneficial to Campbell; he may be the only one who can get him back on track. Likewise, Griffin is shown to be a bit lost without Campbell. It creates a fascinating psychological dependency in a twisted relationship that mirrors the two other male-female relationships that propel the plot, providing a subtext about co-dependency and slightly off-kilter, questionably healthy relationships in general.Although Reeves is often criticized for his acting ability, The Watcher is an excellent example of what that is unjustified. It's not that Reeves doesn't have range. It's that he's extremely subtle. He's not an actor to chew scenery. His Griffin is really just as psychotic as, say, De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver (1976) or Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance in The Shining (1980), but Reeves isn't usually one to maniacally chop down a door with an axe and crazily intone Heeeere's Johnny, you have to watch him closer than that to see the character. Even when he's in full action mode, either as a killer, as he is here, or as a superhero, as in The Matrix (1999), Reeves is all about a kind of quiet control. It's not a better or worse style than De Niro or Nicholson, just different. Spader also gives a finely tuned performance. As the character requirements have it, he's a fine complement for Reeves, somewhat paralleling Reeves' style, somewhat providing a counterpoint.The film has interesting things to say about anonymity in modern societies, especially big cities. Griffin is able to play the games he does only because so many people are faceless and ignored.Charbanic films The Watcher with a unique visual style can be arty--especially during the flashbacks--and conventionally build suspense at the same time. He's also aided by a great score (including a couple brief snippets of Reeves dancing to Rob Zombie) and attractive production design.The Watcher isn't the typical 10 out of 10 film, as its surface gloss is more pedestrian than the usual film of that caliber. But if you dig just a little deeper, you'll find gold.

However, tormented by the anguish of past failures, Campbell is unable to ameliorate his physical and mental health and his bruised existence is again challenged by Griffin's reappearance in Chicago. Amused and motivated by Campbell's compassion toward all female victims, Griffin (who spies on lonely women and then kills them) heightens the stakes of his hide-and-seek game with Campbell by sending him a photograph of the intended victim of the day, thus testing his ability to save her. However, when Griffin's final defiance involves Campbell's psychologist (Marisa Tomei), the two test each other's limits.The Watcher follows its two main characters intimately, often detailing the mechanics of Griffin's moves through Campbell's point of view as an observer who must solve a mystery. By depicting Campbell's dependence on painkillers, for example, The Watcher successfully transmits the deteriorated mental and physical state of this protagonistic character. The Watcher is most intriguing when it attempts to portray a society that --through its indifference-- creates its own victims and delivers, so to speak, the loneliest and most vulnerable to their executioner. The Watcher uses this notion of people's unwillingness to help and builds its suspense by simultaneously emphasizing the protagonist's struggles to beat the murderer's deadline. Furthermore, The Watcher successfully defines both protagonist and antagonist as the watcher of the other, thus suggesting a somewhat sado-masochistic bond between the two. In spite of this success, The Watcher relies on an excess of repeated flashbacks in the form of highly stylized, often blurry, shots that depict Campbell's previous interaction with Griffin. This choice weakens The Watcher's attempts to establish realism around both characters' past connection, and loosens the otherwise tight pace of the plot.The watcher hits on both a realistic level, and an entertaining level never before reached with a movie starring Keanu Reeves.

Many threads are woven throughout and they tie up towards the end of the movie so that most of our questions are answered.Casting is great.  Spader, our hero, is far from perfect & his obsession with catching 'his' man has had a disasterous affect on his life.  He is a complex character who is introducted to us in stages- as the story unravels so does his life.Reeves surprises in his portrayal of a psycho serial killer. He plays this guy with an eerie realism that see him really well cast here.  We hear so many poor reviews of this guy's acting but I can't figure it.  He is really believable in this role and shows once again that he can take any character and 'become' him; whether it is Neo in the Matrix or the lovable Ted from Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.We enter the world of the serial killer & get to see his version of our reality.  We follow the agent in a chase against time to stop the madness.This movie is not run of mill.  It is different & provocative.  I highly recommend it.

But then along came his worst nightmare, serial killer David Allen Griffen (Keanu Reeves in a surprisingly solid performance), an elusive and brilliant serial killer, who preys on innocent women at night and seemingly can't be caught. He's a methodical Killer who knows his work. He's detailed at everything his work involves, including the ins and outs of police procedure. After a year of trying to outsmart this sophisticated killer and always being one step behind, Joel decides to give up and head to Chicago. Here he hopes that maybe he can forget Griffen and his nightmares. But Griffen doesn't want to forget, so he follows Campbell to Chicago to continue their relationship and the killing. While trying to cloud himself in a haze of dependant drugs and self pity, Campbell is forced back in to the game of cat and mouse when Griffen starts sending him pictures of the women he's going to kill. Only this time Griffen puts a new spin on this particular game. Now, instead of just murdering the women, Griffen gives Campbell a chance to save the women, by sending him pictures of his potential victims twelve hours before they actually become his victims.The Watcher isn't a first rate, edge of your seat thriller, but that's okay because I think making it a well made and stylish thriller was the actual intent of Director Joe Charbaniz. This solid mid-budget (by Hollywood standards) thriller boasts some great performances by star Spader, and Academy Award nominee Marisa Tomei, who in the film stars as Spader's psychiatrist, Dr Polly Bellman. But it also has Keanu Reeves showing the best acting display of his carrer in my opinion (maybe because he doesn't have many lines, I'm not really sure), as the demented killer, Griffen. Now for me, and I'm sure for a few other movie fans, there is an added bonus of having Ernie Hudson in it as a Police Chief. I find this an extra treat because I haven't seen Ernie in many A list movies lately, and I find he just has a way of sprucing them up. Charbaniz also used an innovative cat and mouse style due to the fact that it's not so much chase scenes, but duelings of the mind. However, I did find some of the slow motion camera work they used while Reeves was stalking around to be a bit much.Writers David Elliot and Darcy Meyers put together a well made story with the underlining idea that good is nothing without evil, using two men as the message. It also has a few good encounters between Spader and Reeves in which you're actually able to see how these characters are driven in to the relationship they have with one another. I do, however, have to discredit one bit of the movie, where Spader and the police force are looking for a woman who is intended to be the next victim and no one seems to know who she is, or have even seen her for that matter, even though she works in a huge shopping mall where thousands of people dwell everyday. Especially corny is a scene in which they are in the mall looking for her while she is literally standing right beside them, but not one of the ten or so officers turns his or her head for even a second to actually see her.Aside from being bogged down by a few minor details, this fast paced thriller, with style to spare, does work on many different levels and in my opinion is certainly worth a rent. It's a little more sharp then most of its preceeding thrill movies (including Kiss the Girls) even though it's storyline is not overly original. However you can sit through this whole movie and not have a bad aftertaste left in your mouth, which is a lot more then I can say for most of Hollywood's recent releases. So, if you want a little excitement from your entertainment for the evening, don't expect too much from the Watcher and just watch it.Overall Rating 7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"The interaction between Keanu Reeves, James Spader and Marisa Tomei make this film","Date":"2 February 2002","Score":"22 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  The relationship between the characters in the Watcher sets it apart from other serial killer movies.

I would have liked a little more elaboration on what happened in the past between James Spader and Keanu Reeves.  Also, I wish the movie had shown part of the session between the Psychologist, played by Marisa Tomei, and the serial killer, played by Keanu Reeves.  Marisa Tomei's facial reaction to Keanu Reeves' comment prior to the session was perfect.  Do clients come to see you because you are good or because you are very pretty.  (Line by Reeves to Tomei - maybe not verbatum) Keanu Reeves plays David Griffin very well. This is another example showing how Keanu Reeves can take any character and make it both believable and likeable to some extent. Both Reeves and Spader display the need for each other by the end of the film. Yes, I did detect at least a professional need by Spader for Reeves in the Watcher.  So did Marisa Tomei I think. This movie had both a good balance of a crime drama, with the police and car chase scenes, and strong character development.

Basically, Keanu Reeves plays a serial killer who becomes so obsessed with James Spader (the FBI agent who is trying to catch Keanu), that Keanu kidnaps Spader's girlfriend, who ends up dying. The killer actually even says that he does this because he thought the FBI guy was spending too much time focusing on her instead of him (!). FBI guy then has a nervous breakdown of some sort, quits the FBI, moves across the country and lives on disability in what is probably the most depressing apartment ever. James Spader really gives this role 110%. He looks like he's in excruciating pain all the time.The killer tries to get on with his life, even trying to form a new relationship with the new FBI agent assigned to track him down, but it's just not the same. So the killer follows Spader across country and mails him pictures of girls he is going to (and has) killed, in order to coax the former FBI guy back into tracking him. When this fails to get the attention of Spader (he's a total basketcase and doesn't open his mail), the killer SENDS HIM FLOWERS, along with a picture of the girl Keanu is going to kill in 24 hours unless Spader can find her first. This effectively breaks the basketcase away from his new full time job of staring at the walls of his bleak apartment and gets him back in the swing of hunting the killer.Up to this point, the movie is actually really good and engaging. I cared about this broken shell of a man who is trying to recover from his mental breakdown caused by a maniac who refuses (for what appear to be rather taboo reasons) to leave him alone. But about halfway through the film, the movie seemed to just sort of give up and degenerated into a fairly run of the mill cat-and-mouse type thing. Usually, when a movie starts out quirky, it stays quirky. Or if it's going to be mediocre, it starts out that way and doesn't change. This movie could have been something really special if the filmmakers would have had the guts to follow through on the set up and what was REALLY going on between the killer and the FBI guy, instead of just letting the movie devolve into a boring rehash of just about every other cop-chasing-maniacal-killer movie we've ever seen.

Sound familiar? It should. Joe Charbanic's The Watcher is another rehearse in Hollywood's obsession with serial killer films that call for big stars and bloody murders. Just a few weeks ago, Urban Legends Final Cut was released, also detailing a psychopath brutally murdering young adults while teasing potential victims with cruel gimmicks. I am getting very tired of the same old recycled material found in this kind of production. 	All serial killer movies have a gimmick; this film's is the protagonist's involvement with the killer himself. The main character, Joel Campbell (James Spader), is an FBI agent who recently moved from Los Angeles to Chicago to escape the stress and recollections of his experiences tracking down psychotic murderers, specifically David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves), who's trademark includes strangling young women with piano strings. Campbell's past has left him with severe migraine headaches and a dependency on prescription medication, both problems he and Dr. Polly Peilman (Marisa Tomei), a young psychiatrist, are trying to solve. 	 It isn't long before Griffin discovers Campbell and begins playing cat and mouse games again. Griffin mails Campbell a photo of his next victim and allows 24 hours for the police to find and rescue her. With the help of two other detectives, Hollis Mackey (Chris Ellis) and Mitch Casper (Robert Cicchini), Campbell is determined to bring down this mad man.	The movie is over the top in most elements. The style teases and interrogates, but is also boastful and distracting. The protagonist's personality is also exaggerated, supported by blunt dialogue (supporting character That is gonna be hard. Campbell Life is hard.) and filled with familiar clich√©s including personal tragedy involved with the killer and his own family. But the killer himself lacks successful development. The movie lazily introduces Griffin through voice-over narration and silhouetted images; we never really receive a description, but instead intuition and implications.  	A big problem I had with the film is that many of its murder sequences consist of a brainless victim screaming helplessly instead of attempting to defend themselves. The victims stand out more than the main characters here, so they should have much more priority in their murder sequences. They also need further examination so we actually care about someone in the story. There is a lengthy, exciting, and suspenseful sequence in which a homeless young woman actually puts up a fight to escape the clutches of Griffin, developing tension and one of the most insinuating chase scenes all year. Too bad there were not more of this type of incident in The Watcher. The performances are actually better than the movie deserves, as is some of the suspense. Perhaps the biggest controversy found within this movie is Keanu Reeves playing a villain. After being in movies like The Matrix and Speed, audiences come to expect him to save the day, not brutally murder women. As Griffin, he makes more of the character than the film provides; I liked his effective performance, although he does not include the psychotic touch that actors like Vince Vaughn and Christian Bale have. James Spader comes off as his usual stale, boring self in a role that is way too oppressive for his capabilities. 	The Watcher is a one-line script it is predictable and the same situation is repeated over and over, sagging its line of tension. It concludes in a predicable, expected outcome that is explosive and action packed, but lacks a satisfying feeling we normally experience in this kind of movie. The Watcher is simply another serial killer picture made with the hopes of grossing millions of dollars, which probably explains why there are so many things wrong with it.

The plot was written in a way to make the characters very believable and real. Spader plays a tragic hero that needs the bad guy (under-played to perfection by Reeves) to come back into his life in order to find closure with his past and come to terms with the present. Neither Spader nor Reeves played to stereotypes common to this genre, and as a result, their performances were gritty and powerful without coming across as over-the-top.  Stereotyped performances are a common weakness in many other similar movies, which are also good movies, but they rely on star performances from their marquee actors. This becomes a troublesome thing when the acting tends to define the movie and hides weaknesses and implausibility within the script. Recent examples of this are seen in The Bone Collector, Copycat, and Kiss The Girls. I liked each of these movies for different reasons, but The Watcher was more real to me because the actors weren't playing a type. Spader showed a reluctant vulnerability and a controlled intensity that was very true-to-life in my experience. And Reeves was so spooky as the serial killer because he tried to show a small sliver of his Evil each time without ever overdoing it. Another great surprise was Tomei, who came out of semi-retirement to also give us a dead-on performance as Spader's psychiatrist. She, too, acted emotionally in a way that filled the role without ever becoming a movie stereotype. Visually, her hair, make-up, and clothes helped downplay her character and allowed her to become just another real person who arbitrarily became involved in things. I think this was a great choice for her.

This is not the greatest serial killer movie ever made but it's very entertaining.  The actors save this film. Keanu Reeves delves into his dark side and pulls out a winner. I will admit that I'm a Keanu Fan. I enjoy his work and disagree with all the nay sayers who cannot get past one role in his varied repertoire. Keanu uses his smile and eyes in this film much the same way Jack Nicholson did in The Shining. Keanu's smile, which is usually so engaging, is much extremely menacing here. His eyes are chilling. The windows to Griffin's soul are hard and cold especially when combined with the smile. He brings an element of subtle, gleeful danger to the character of Griffin. He walks with an arrogant swagger. His interchanges with James Spader are a seductive waltz as he tries to lure Spader's burnt-out agent closer to the homoerotic, symbiotic relationship that they only share in Griffin's mind. Subtlety is the key to all the performances in this film. Spader and Reeves refuse to go over the top even in the most visceral scenes. Neither actor took the easy way. Marisa Tomei was also excellent. She showed nuances in her acting that I had not believed she was capable of expressing. Overall, this movie is a must see.

It means that this is a below-par effort.The story line of cop pursuing serial killer is easy to follow. By now it has become standard, as in many westerns the plots revolve around land disputes. The question is how well it is done and what new twists occur or new insights. In this one, there are two main themes. One is the dependence of the cop's (Spader's) life on pursuit and apprehension of this killer (Reeves) who has followed him from LA to Chicago, since he also depends on Spader to provide him his jollies. The second theme is the atomization of people in a large city and the difficulty of communicating with them on a personal level. Few want to get involved in identifying a threatened person, and those that do may be providing silly information merely to get attention.Yet somehow the first theme of Spader-Reeves symbiosis doesn't come across as convincing. That's one fault. Another is that the Reeves character is not convincing. The movie tends to drag after awhile. Even the obligatory chase scenes seem as if they are not from the heart, despite their decent enough staging. They seem by the numbers. There is something curiously uninvolving about this movie.As in other movies that fall short, I blame the script for failing to introduce sufficient dramatic scenes whereby the nature of the characters is brought out so that viewers understand and engage with them. It's what the script writers do not put on the screen, instead putting wasted scenes on the screen, that matters. It's seems clearer and clearer that Hollywood could use a few top flight script doctors. If there really is a symbiosis, it shouldn't be shown by talk or by the insight of a psychiatrist, it should be shown by activities of the two principals.David Elliot and Clay Ayers did the screenplay. They didn't shine. The movie had a slew of producers, maybe too many for anyone to be able to shape this movie into something beyond the average. The director was unable to lift the project by his contributions. He might have been able to do so. The film editing had some good spots, but editing alone cannot change the script. Overall the result is a good try at an unusual theme but coming out rather undistinguished.

Unfortunately, the ghostly murderer follows him to the windy city and once again begins killing women. Barely existing in between his nightmares and his medication, Dectective Campbell is drawn back into the dark demented world of his elusive suspect, when he seeks help to understand his mental anxieties. With the help of Chicago police detectives, (Ernie Hudson) the game of death takes on a double urgency when the killer begins sending photos of his intended victim 24 hours prior to murdering them. Difficult as it is, audience members must get past the fact that Reeves usually plays the hero, but here he is the heavy. Reeves is a superior actor and is convincing as he plays against Spader. Both are superior thespians who allow this black drama to rise above the mundane to entertain us with exciting car chase scenes and murderous mayhem. Marisa Tomei plays Polly a mental health therapist who finds herself a potential victim.

How painful would that be! Thankfully, that bizarre dance-like scene didn't go on any longer than the first couple of minutes (although there was a mercifully brief reprise near the end.) The problem is that even with Keanu's dancing gone, the movie didn't get much better. It's another story about a serial killer (Reeves) playing a cat and mouse game with a cop (James Spader) that he develops something of an obsession with. In this case it's FBI agent Campbell, and in a ridiculous plot point, Campbell is haunted by his inability to catch the serial killer 3 years before in LA. He's now moved to Chicago, he's on disability, he's popping pills, he's suffering severe migraines, he's seeing a psychologist and - from what he tells her - he seems generally unable to function in life. So, of course, with that background and all those problems, when the killer suddenly reappears in Chicago, Campbell is not only asked to help with the case - he's put in charge of it! That makes sense! We spend a significant amount of time watching cops handing out posters with the picture of the killers' next victim on it - because part of his game is sending a picture of who he's going to kill to the cops and giving them a day to try to find her. The dialogue is pretty limited although the performances from Reeves and Spader were OK. There's a bit of a startling revelation when we find out why Campbell is really haunted by the LA murders (and, probably, why he moved to Chicago.) On the other hand, you can predict almost from the beginning that the psychologist (Marisa Tomei) will eventually be targeted and become the focal point of the final showdown. For a brief moment at the end, after the killer has thrown himself out a window and into Lake Michigan while he's on fire, I had a bit of a sinking feeling that this was going to be a killer who should be dead refuses to die so that there can be a sequel moment.

As is the case with many music video directors, Charbanic is extremely creative with the camera.  He uses innovative camera angles, close-ups, jump cuts and strobe photography very effectively.  Along with veteran cinematographer Michael Chapman (`Taxi Driver', `Raging Bull', `Rising Sun', `Primal Fear'), he brings some very compelling imagery to the screen.  However, this is only part of the director's job.  He must also pull the story together and eliminate any inconsistencies from the script.  Most importantly, he must get the actors to properly interpret their characters.  In these areas, Charbanic is far less capable and it hurts the film.The initial workup is intriguing.  David Allen Griffin (Keanu Reeves) is a serial killer who has developed an obsession with Joel Campbell (James Spader), the cop who has been pursuing him.  When the cop retires from the force on disability and moves to Chicago, the killer follows and resumes the killings there to torment his adversary.  Griffin sends Campbell pictures of his victims in advance and dares him to try to find them before he kills them.  The story is fairly tight to this point, but unravels totally after Griffin lures Campbell to a graveyard and they meet face to face.  From this point forward, the absurdities are piled on to the point of silliness.The acting is problematic.  Keanu Reeves is an excellent actor, but he is miscast as the killer.  He is just too nice a guy to be a sociopath.  Actually, it probably would have been better if they flipped the leads because Spader would have made a very believable killer.  Normally dynamic and energetic, Marisa Tomei seems almost comatose in her dialogue with Spader during the therapy scenes, although she is great as the terrified victim after being abducted.  The entire cast seems flat and subdued, the responsibility for which I put with Charbanic.  While Charbanic's images crackle, the actors are soggy.

I've always loved James Spader and he shines here as usual. His portrait of the haunted Joel Campbell is emotionally compelling and believable. Keanu Reeves also does well here -- his Griffin is incredibly charming in a very creepy way. The other thing that makes this movie stand above other serial killer films is the focus on the interaction between the two men - killer and detective -- and the fact that the obsession is played both ways. It's not just about Reeves being obsessed with Spader; it's about Spader being obsessed with Reeves as well. The scenes between them together at the end were outstanding; but way too short. The only complaint I have about the movie is that we were short-changed on the pay off at the end. After an hour and half of homoerotic tension and emotional intensity, a longer scene between the two men was desperately needed for full impact. Even so, I was completely caught up in the movie from the beginning and I will definitely see it again...and again...

Each man needs the other for a sense of identity. They function as a single entity, even though their motives are in moral opposition. Actually, it's a rather tired film concept.In Chicago, Campbell introduces the story premise about serial killer Griffin who preys on young women, and uses his killings as a game to be played out with Campbell, who has no choice but to participate. The film's structure relies on tons of flashbacks to Campbell's previous involvement with the killer in California.The main problem here is that the film's plot depends on multiple film clich√©s. You've got your standard police chase scenes with flashing lights and screeching tires. You've got your standard melodramatic TV news, repeated over and over and over. You've got a killer who can miraculously overcome every obstacle thrown at him. The film's final twenty minutes are nothing but a string of cinematic clich√©s.You get the feeling that the filmmakers used a tried-and-true money making film concept as a template, hurriedly wrote a script, then attached well-known box-office actors to rev up the financial bottom line, for quick megabucks. If that was their plan, I don't think it worked. For many viewers, including myself, the film comes across as stale, insipid, and uninspired.The acting is not convincing. Both James Spader and Keanu Reeves sleepwalk through their roles, emotionally uninvolved. The casting of lovely Marisa Tomei as a psychiatrist is not credible, in a role meant for an older intellectual. But, of course, as a beautiful young woman, Tomei fits in nicely as a handy target for the killer. And the film's contemporary pumped up rock music I found irritating and distracting. The color cinematography is adequate, if conventional.The Watcher is just one more cop and killer movie in a saturated genre. The film has nothing new or original to offer viewers. Maybe the two lead actors will be a tad more discerning next time when they select screenplay roles.

It could have something to do with my expectations being so low for the movie after hearing how bad it was from everybody, but this film is a very original, atmospheric and well played. The cast was great, especially James Spader and Keanu Reeves. Spader is a master-actor and can bring the required level of intensity to any role. He is one the best actors ever and in my opinion cab easily be compared to Sean our Penn, Gary Oldman and James Woods.Keanu Reeve's portrayal of the serial killer Griffin is truly chilling and stylistic. I think it was Keanu's intention to make the killer larger than life and give him a flair of invincibility to make it interesting for the audience. Keanu's serial killer is one of the most twisted and merciless killers I have seen on screen. People don't appreciate Keanu's acting and say that he plays himself. NO! The thing is that Reeve's was chosen because the director knew that audiences are not used to seeing him in an evil role and hence would respond negatively when seeing their goody-two-shoes Keanu play a sick killer. Bravo Keanu. I admire you gut to break taboos and also your brilliant portrayal of the killer. Griffin feels real and that is what acting is all about, making characters seem real.

In reality, it is little more than a highly stylized showcase for all of the classic thriller clich√©s that have become so well-known throughout the last century, taking them and giving them an extra flare by using stunning cinematic tricks, a stellar cast and a pounding soundtrack. I am divided as to whether I like this movie or not I enjoyed the vast array of shocking and vivid images, while I tended to become a bit bored by the clich√©s it portrayed throughout. I can't say that I completely hated this film, yet I cannot fully like it, either. The movie begins when FBI agent Joel Campbell begins receiving phone calls and photographs from his arch nemesis, a serial killer whose last alias was that of David Allen Griffin. He takes special care in killing lonely women with piano wire, leaving the scene of the crime with no trace of his identity. Campbell has a personal connection to Griffin through his flashbacks, we see his attempt to rescue a woman trapped in a burning house, and his relationship to this woman as well as his involvement with Griffin will all be revealed in due time, one of the movie's attributes.Actors for The Watcher deliver quality performances that make the movie enjoyable. James Spader plays the delusional detective Joel Campbell, and he does a perfect job in delivering Campbell's emotions when it comes to pursuing his target. We are able to believe in his not wanting to give up despite the effects it may have on him physically and emotionally. Spader plays Campbell as a stern and aggressive character, the character to root for throughout. Keanu Reeves plays his rival, David Allen Griffin, and does one of his better acting jobs here. This is material he was born to play... he possesses wit and a certain twisted charm that is untypical to Griffin's character, and that makes him a better serial killer than most other movies. Oscar winner Marisa Tomei plays therapist Polly Beilman, though she is not really able to display a lot of her talent in this film, as it focuses mainly on the two leads and their physical and psychological battle with one another.Overall rating 7 out of 10.

It's almost as if the two, Campbell & Griffin, were soul mates or Siamese twins without being psychically connected to each other.Campbell has moved to Chicago from his hometown in L.A to get his mixed-up and confused head back together which has Griffin travel there as well in order to keep up his relationship with him. This all stemmed from a murder that Griffin committed back in L.A, that we see in a number of flash-backs, involving Campbell's girlfriend Lisa Alton whom he was having an illicit, she was married and he wasn't, affair with. Now back in business killing young women Griffin gets Campbell involved in his new string of murders by sending him Fed-X envelopes with photos of his intended victims who's murders Campbell as well as the Chicago Police FBI and local SWAT team are to try to prevent.The movie really goes nowhere with Grffin doing his thing, murdering young women, and being totally immune from capture. Even a number of his on screen victims, Ellie & Jessica, don't as much as even get a hint that their being targeted by Griffin! Even though their photos, those that Griffin sent Campbell, are splashed all over the TV and newspapers as well as police posters. Don't they ever turn on the TV news or read the newspapers? what's even more fascinating is that no one on the street or knows the two, Ellie & Jessica, don't at all recognize them either as Griffin's intended victims. That despite all the publicity they've gotten by the news media to find out who they are and save their lives! ***SPOILERS*** It seems that Campbell's psychiatrist the pretty Dr. Polly Bellman really got under Griffin's skin in him getting jealous of Polly and suspecting that his soul-mate FBI Agent Campbell was having a romantic relationship with her.

Well, when I had the opportunity to watch it, I knew that it isn't that ugly after all.It's the fashion at the moment  the thrilling hunt for that smart, energetic, and completely crazy serial killer. After 9 years of it, (The Silence of the Lambs) was still swaying. Most of its following had nothing more than the dark atmosphere and the action. However this time, and a la the original, the relationship between the officer and the criminal produces a meaning. The movie points out sadly to the fact that people became too many and too busy to look to each others, so love became hard to find, consequently life became out of sense. It's distinct to have a movie of that kind while being not out of sense itself.I hated slight points like that FBI agent who dislikes the returning James Spader. That line didn't affect anything later, so why to make it in the first place ?! Then, the coincidence of being, out of all places, in the same mall which one of the victims works at. But, whatever. That wasn't the problem. The problems though were else where.Let's declare the always concealed, or twisted, or not spoken about much truth  Keanu Reeves doesn't know how to act. He acted in one movie, ironically one of his first, (Speed &#x96; 1994). Strangely later, and in a precedent, he turned into worse actor, and worse, and worse as he aged !Supposedly Reeves acts as the evil nuts while being terrifyingly frozen. Ultimately he just did nothing but reading his lines with dead puffed up face, managing to be terrifyingly frozen, yet as an actor ! At one point I said to myself he doesn't have to slaughter the girls. All what he has to do is acting, or dancing, for them a little !. I deem the scene of his crazy dancing as one of the silliest images ever captured on film at all. No kidding ! Then, the director  Joe Charbanic. I don't know the guy, but according to the way he handled everything I believe he is, or has a passion to be, one of the masters of the V movies' crap. Nothing was tense about the movie. At the first phone call between the lead and its antagonist, see how he films Reeves from 2 angles with still cadres and dull cutting. The acting assures that he doesn't know a lot about acting. And the damn special effect, which he used while the actors' running, made them like idiots chasing each other in a comic silent movie from the 1920s. I couldn't stop laughing in front of that. Here's the cat's vomit. Truly, pedantry is evil !Spader did it good. But he doesn't have the charismatic glow. Despite the shortness and the usualness of her role, Marisa Tomei could be memorable due to her so expressive tearful eyes. Some of the soundtrack's rock songs did soothe the atmosphere or stir it up. I loved the one played during the search for a victim. Its lyrics harmonized with the somewhat deep sad core, embodying &#x96; even swiftly &#x96; the movie's case of desolate cities, and state, we live. As a script it's nice. It has thrill and good meaning to it, and that's rare if you ask me. As a movie it is not that nice. Wanna know why, then ask yourself why our dear director had to picture everything Reeves sees in the psychological doctor's clinic like it's an electronic image seen from The Terminator's point of view ?! Albeit Reeves as a robot sucks too ! I think that moment summarizes the answer to my question and the whole movie.As you see, (The Watcher) has 2 killers, not one !

The killer (Keanu Reeves) thinks he's made a friend of sorts in that Spader needs him to continue what he's doing in order for his existence to have some meaning. In short; Reeves feels that Spader needs him. And that's something Reeves likes very much. In the beginning of the film it's actually Reeves, who's relocated to the city the agent has moved to, who is responsible for Spader's resurrection of sorts when he starts killing again.Lofty ideas and solid social commentary may have been part of the aim in The Watcher but a clumsy script with some very silly dialog at times, huge loopholes, a very unconvincing performance by Reeves, cardboard supporting characters, annoying frenzied editing, way too experimental photography and a rushed ending keep the film from achieving anything special.Reeves can be quite good when the material suits him but here the primary focus seems to be making him look cool and hip (and very dashing) rather than authentic. He has some very bad lines to work with as well. It just looks like he didn't strain himself too much. Fortunately Spader is terrific. His character is a bit eccentric and Spader practically has a PHD in eccentric characters and he easily walks off with the film. Tomei, an excellent actress, is neither here nor there as a psychiatrist.To the film's credit though; it's fast paced, has a great chase scene halfway through and manages to build a reasonable amount of tension at times. The Watcher is a decent enough time filler on a slow night. Just don't expect something great; apart from a stellar performance by the reliable James Spader.

It's a standard cat and mouse thriller with an entertaining relationship drawn between the baddie and the goodie (who has enough on his plate just trying to deal with his problems on the couch of his shrink, played by Marisa Tomei).While there's nothing at all original here, with the exception of Reeves' casting, it's all done well enough and the script is surprisingly witty in places when providing exchanges between Reeves and Spader or just letting Spader loose barbs towards whoever is in his vicinity at the time.And I must add that while I have said Reeves is woefully miscast, and this is true for the most part, there ARE a few moments when it works really well to see his laid-back, friendly demeanour used to lure unsuspecting innocents into a false sense of security.Panned by almost everyone when it was released, I think that the movie was treated a tad unfairly and actually enjoyed it much more than many other thrillers that were praised by genre fans. Yes, there are a few scenes to make you cringe (not least the very beginning and an implausible escape sequence) but the movie carries you along with some decent tension and wit.See this if you like Kiss The Girls, Taking Lives, Red Dragon.

It's so cunning too how Griffin plays the cat and mouse games with Joel as he leaves a timetable of death for each victim. And his methods are cruel and sadistic as each female he abducts he ties them up tapes their mouths with duct tape and mocks them before their deaths. The only comfort that Joel can find is in the form of a counselor played in a good supporting way by the beautiful Marisa Tomei. This really is a good film the action is pumping as each scene is heart pounding and the chase is intense as this dangerous killer is tracked in a cat and mouse style.

It doesn't become apparent to burnt out FBI Agent Joel Campbell (Jack Spader), who's also known to his friends as Captain Barbiturate, that it's the work of a serial killer that he was involved with in the past David Allen Griffin.It in fact was Griffin himself who cued in the drugged out on anti-depression pills Campbell to his murderous actions by sending him FEDX envelopes with photos of his intended victims, one who lived in Campbell's apartment house, before he actually murdered them! Campbell being so out of it and not bothering to open his mail, for as much as weeks at a time,had in a way let Griffin get away with the murder of two of his victims. Getting his head back together, by reading his mail, Campbell suddenly realizes that the MO of the killer is that of Griffin whom he was trying to track down back in L.A. In fact Griffin himself, by mail and phone, makes that very obvious fact known to Campbell if he can't, due to his addiction on prescription drugs, figure that out by himself!As you watch Griffin in action it becomes very obvious that he's somehow hung up on Campbell and needs him to play this deadly cat and mouse game with him that he stopped playing after he got a section eight, mental disability, from the FBI. Campbell now raising to the occasion, by getting himself reinstated in the agency, picks up where he left off, back in L.A. in him tracking down and and trying to bring Griffin to justice. As things turns out Campbell doesn't quite have the stomach in confronting Griffin that he had back in L.A. before he suffered a serious mental breakdown.Sending Campbell photo's of his latest victims Griffin gives him, and the local police and FBI, all leeway he needs to not only stop Griffin from murdering them but also be able to capture him. Still Campbell together with the cops are just too slow, or Griffin is just too cunning, to stop or capture the elusive serial killer.It soon becomes very apparent that Griffin is angry at Campbell for ignoring him after, in Griffin's mind, all the fun they had playing the game of FBI Agent and Serial Murderer back on the West Coast. It's when Griffin finds out that Campbell is taking twice a week, with the US Government or FBI picking up the tab, psychiatric treatments from Dr. Polly Beilman, Marisa Tomei, that he completely freaks out feeling that she's replacing him as Campbell's personal playmate! The Campbell/Griffin/Dr. Polly strange relationship is not that far fetched at all in that it was another woman Lisa Anton, Yvonne Niami, back in L.A who made Griffin get out of just murdering his victims for fun but for personal jealousy. Feeling that Dr. Polly is breaking up his strange and bizarre relationship with his protagonist Joel Campbell Griffin has in store for her what he did to Miss. Anton.

Reeves' serial killer character leads the Chicago Police Department through a rather simplistic maze of clues to find him. As the movie moves along it becomes very evident that the serial killer wants to be caught to renew his special kinship with Spader's FBI character. Spader and Marisa Tomei played their characters nicely, though I thought they should have been better defined. The foundation of this movie was very strong, but the ending  seemed over simplified and without a lot of creativity.

This is a decent film. It's not a great film, but it's an average-to-good film, depending on that upon which you focus. Its biggest weaknesses are so-so direction (there are a couple nicely done scenes, but for the most part, I found the direction annoying and pretentious) and by-the-numbers plotting and pacing. But there's some meat here, too, that most of the critics seem to be missing -- perhaps because they =don't= know the psychology of serial killers and their hunters, or perhaps because they were turned off by the direction. Some lovely, lovely psych stuff in here that rings true with everything I've learned on the subject of this particular breed of serial killer, though Hollywoodized.Spader's performance is excellent.  Reeves is ok-to-excellent --there are a couple rough spots that I suspect were first in the filming sequence, before he was really in the character's head. Tomei doesn't have a lot to do, but delivers what there is just fine.  Robert Cicchini's performance is also superior.If you're looking for a thriller with substantive content (albeit intellectualized and mainly through subtext) and like to get inside people's heads and take a look around, and can overlook directorial choices that belong back in the first year of film school, this is a good flick. You'll know each twist, each plot progression in advance, but in a way, that's a good thing here, because it leaves you free to focus on the subtext -- and there's one hell of a lot of subtext here, including homoerotic.

This film doesn't rely on gratuitous uncomfortable and horrific ordeals to notch up the fear-factor despite Griffin (Reeves) being a prolific serial killer - unusually the murdered girls are more or less incidental and his particular interest in what he does is never disclosed. You do feel the tension, and it is a gripping and tense thriller, where less is more for the nasty bits. The plot centres around the sadomasochistic reliance between the serial killer and the cop Campbell (Spader). For Campbell, the fallout from chasing Griffin, and giving up and moving away, has ruined his life so completely that rather than Griffin being his raison d'etre, he is all he has been left with; his hatred, guilt, insomnia, night terrors and prescription drug dependency for debilitating migraines keep Griffin in the centre of his world albeit unwelcome and from which he is unable to escape. Conversely, Griffin's psychopathology for some reason has evolved to require Campbell as an addition to his efficient killing theatre; he doesn't seem afraid of being caught, and takes increasing risks for proximity with Campbell. The psychology here would be interesting, but it is glossed over other than brief mentions of past events (ie the involvement of Campbell's girlfriend) and Campbell's Psychiatrist Polly (Marisa Tomei) falls into the Hollywood trap of limiting psychology/psychiatry to clich√©d questions which shed little light. Despite her implausibility but predictable involvement, it is she who voices that they need each other &#x96; Griffin describes Campbell as his best friend and brother, and alludes to deeper significance between them and it is a lack of a clear explanation that I feel is the gaping hole in the plot but the film works well without it, it's just ME who's interested in forensic psychology and wants to know why. Marisa Tomei's performance is good but the screenplay limits her potential, and Spader and Reeves overshadow her. Spader is one of my favourite actors, he is terribly underrated and, like Reeves, his screen presence and acting method lies in the minutiae of a performance and Spader shines as broken, exhausted and desperate and it is unusual for him to be in an action role. Reeves is charming, friendly, a little flirtatious to be beguiling as Griffin, and as dangerous as a smiling crocodile. Unlike most cop dramas roles are reversed, Reeves is both beautiful and hideous in his portrayal, remarkably well adjusted and secure and Spader is the addled victim in free-fall. The clock is constantly ticking, and it's tense watching the police desperate to win, and always they are so agonisingly close - which the audience sees but the characters can't, which is clever. The cinematography is a melange of styles and devices to narrate the story - dream-sequences that tell back-story that are repeated with increasing revelation, blurred images, romantic bright montages, slow-motion, staccato frames, and grainy black and white and heavy breathing heard over the soundtrack &#x96; none are original but are used here in abundance and confusing. The music too is controversial and sometimes incongruous, yet again, and as the viewer you are very aware that all these are being used deliberately and they seem too contrived but I'm not sure whether they are successful &#x96; I quite liked them but some saw them as amateurish. The film sets up its predictability, but then in a cop vs killer film there is little that can be truly original. It is a rather satisfying film, but perhaps the Director was trying too hard by over-reaching with a mediocre screenplay or by overuse of too many styles and not having the gumption to know whether they were doing drama, thriller, chiller, action film or even a dark comedy as there was some humour (especially Chris Ellis as other cop Hollis) in there. It seems to flail a bit, and reaches too far and misses to be excellent. It's a good film but the performances of Spader and Reeves hold its head above water.

Most films you see the murder happen or often with the police finding the victim... right? In this film the killer gives police a day to find victims. During that time it is sort of like getting to know them. When the time comes that they must die or triumph over the killer, you really care! Not like most films where you wait for the death in anticipation. In this one you really want them to survive.   James Spader and Keanu Reeves give EXCELLENT performances.

Actually, in a sense, The Watcher is an amazing accomplishment because, let's be honest, it's got to take effort to make a movie this bad.Okay, I'll be honest with you; I'm having some trouble thinking of what to say in this review because, well, there's so much wrong with The Watcher that I just can't think of where to begin.  Or perhaps my mind has been permanently damaged by the incoherent and constant use of flashback in the movie, not the mention the slow motion.  Don't get me started on the slow motion!  Look!  Keanu's dancing to Rob Zombie!  Better shoot it in slow motion; it'll make him seem reeeaaal scary!  What's that?  A chase screen?  Whip out that slow motion, raise the dramatic bar, yeah!  Huh?  Keanu's looking at someone?  Make sure you use that slow motion because everyone knows that serial killers don't view the world at normal speed.  Seriously, like half the movie is shot in slow motion, which only seems to make The Watcher seem even longer than it already is.  And when you want a movie to end as badly as I wanted this one to end, you just don't want that, let me tell you.And let's just leave the ridiculous plot and terrible acting out of this altogether and talk about the soundtrack for a moment.  A lot of the film is filled with your pretty typical scary movie type of music, and it's overused and annoying in of itself.  But what's up with all the techno rock stuff?  In the middle of some really important, climatic scene, where someone's about to die or something, I'm not thinking it's a good idea to whip out the drum machine and turn up the bass.And what's up with that phantom police car?  I'm not kidding, at one point, James Spader's in the middle of a chase and a cop car appears out of nowhere, door open, keys in ignition, siren on, and Spader just hops in it and goes.  Where did that car come from?  I demand to know!Well, needless to say, I hate this movie in a crazy, angry kind of way.  There were points in the movie during which I was literally shaking my fist at the screen from the sheer irritation of it all.

Keanu Reeves once said that you can go far in life by the simple act of paying attention. To paraphrase Morpheus in The Matrix, I would ask critics, Are you watching The Watcher? Or are you looking at the woman in the red dress? Are you seeing what is before your eyes, or bringing all your preconceived distracting notions to your viewing of the film?Jettison preconceived notions about film technique being self-indulgent on the part of the director. You think a film has to be all in focus, on tightly matched stock, and with principle actors always lit? Oh you might make an exception for Blair Witch and Martin Scorsesse, but otherwise they blow off techniques as intrusive.  You enjoy Hemingway for his clear, clean, crisp prose. So, you'd blow off Virginia Woolf or Shakespeare because they demonstrate verbal exuberance and intricacy of technique?The Watcher is exuberant in technique and therefore exciting--something is happening visually every minute. Like The Matrix used special effects, The Watcher uses photographic techniques, always pounding forward. This movie doesn't veer off the track of it's story, it doesn't mess around. That's why it can pack a wholloping story into 97 minutes. It's an odd word to use in the context, but this movie is PURE. PURE as in CONCENTRATED, 99 & 99/100% pure storytelling--in images & characterizations conveyed not just in words but strongly in the visual realm. Hey, one picture worth a thousand words; one sound-enhanced, talking, moving picture worth innumerable densely worded scripts. And Jettison those preconceived notions about Keanu Reeves. He's playing Ted dude over the top, you say. He's wooden, walking through the movie? Where you paying attention? I think not. When he seems like Ted dude, he's playing off the persona. You say wooden, but I see subtle, playing off the everyman, ordinary guy quality he so effortlessly embodies. Reeves brought out multidimensions--he could make you laugh while you felt absolutely creepy.  He looked charming enough to fool the girls, but with something not quite right about him--perfectly in character. And that dancing Reeves did--lithe and rhythmic, but at the same time skin-crawlingly CREEPY. Think Nicholson in The Shining. You want backstory on why Griffin kills? Check that notion. You want to spoil the core of the piece--the serial killer as an irrational, not-to-be understood force of human nature. This is how we see them, how they come to us over the wires and the airwaves--without their story told.Jettison those preconceived notions about Spader's career crashing. Did you see the sympathy evoked for his in the camera, just by his demeanor and the way he speaks his lines. And yet, as with Reeves, there are resonances at play here too, with the not-so-good, the downright bad roles, Spader has played. The director, Joe Charbanic, said he wanted actors who could have interchanged the Griffin and the Campbell roles. He definitely got those actors. Casting can be an art too.You critics said, it made so sense for Campbell stop pursuing his nemesis. He lacked motivation for quitting and then taking up detecting again. Hello? Did you get the intelligence of the script in just suggesting (not spelling it out) that for Campbell, in his awful professional detachment, pursing Griffin was just like a challenge, a game that kept him sparkling and alive. Until Griffin got jealous and murdered close to Campbell's heart, killing his enthusiasm for the game. It's more than both characters wearing surgical gloves that links the characters together. There's some depth here, something to think about, if you're paying attention.The actors don't look good you say? There's faded glory there in Spader and Tomei, as the director intended. There's a charm oozing up from Griffin--heck, I'd dance with him as he was in the photo shop or on with the homeless woman.  Your idea of beauty must be a very shallow notion.There was some falling out with the director.  Did that distract you? Oh, I think it did. When obviously Reeves is acting his heart out here, when obviously the director and cinematographer are enhancing every nuance of that performance by their art.  And checkout the homage to The Matrix. Betcha didn't even see it. Oh maybe you caught the Rob Zombie song, but did you see the odd picture on the wall in the head detective's office (of a keyboard, reminiscent of pictures on the wall in the Metacortex building); the very evocative graffiti; the reflections in glasses; and the greenish phone that rings (not buzzes) waking a lonely guy from sleep in his narrow single bed in his cluttered solitary apartment. This is the kind of allusion to and influence from The Matrix that is a joy to see.So to critics, are you watching, The Watcher? Or are you thinking about what you plan to write in your review?

Yes, they likely did some DNR (digital noise reduction) since this is one of the earlier Blu-rays, but not detrimentally so. The picture is sharp, clean and very nice looking. For a 2000 film it looks awesome, and the sound is very good too.Now, to the film...I sure don't understand some of these very nasty and negative reviews. This was quite simply a riveting, well made, well acted Crime Thriller. I honestly don't know what more you could want or ask for in a film of this type. One person here said something about MTV and 'Frenetic Editing'...??? WHAT...?! It was exactly the opposite. YES, the film and visual techniques are indeed stylized, but there is absolutely NOTHING 'Frenetic' about it. Watch the 2nd and 3rd 'Bourne' films if you want to see what frenetic editing looks like. There is a total absence of palsy-induced, shaky camera work. The shots are classically structured and edited. The style comes in with some nice colouring effects thrown in HERE AND THERE and I personally REALLY loved the soundtrack. Yes, it is from it's time, but the songs are very effective and there is a nice blend of original scoring too that fits the film quite nicely. Technically, to me anyway, the film is flawless and looked and sounded great (especially on Blu-ray )Whether you like Keanu or not might have a bearing as to how much you like the film. I felt that for the part that he played that he pulled it off nicely and his characterization was perfect. I have always really loved James Spader (platonically ) I think he is the living $h!tz of cool. I've just always really dug the understated and low- key, sardonic slant that he gives his characters. All the other supporting actors / actresses did a fine job that also fit in very well with the tone and feel of the film.It is a Classic Serial Killer / Police Thriller with great action, excellent pacing, and a nice time-appropriate feel and style. I really liked the director and the way he did the film very much. I was quite surprised to see that he did not go on to make very many more films. For this Genre, I felt that he delivered a very effective movie. It certainly is not just Mindless Action as so many others are. There is a very real soul and believability to the characters and why they do what they do. I think that the mood and overall feel of the film is perfect, with a well suited soundtrack. Oh, without giving anything away, I LOVED the scene at about 37 minutes as the cops gather briefly in the mall to look for the current victim. Truly Classic!I don't know... maybe people are all into the current trend of Dark, moody Noir Thrillers that are coming out now. And, granted, I love those too, I really do. BUT... I guess even though this was made only about 15 years ago, it's look and style might be considered kind of antiquated compared to newer films. That may be true. But, in my lowly and wretched opinion, I feel that that is NO reason to dismiss this highly entertaining and involving Thriller just because it comes from a slightly different era. Some jaded numbnut snobs here glibly state, Full of '90s clich√©s That just simply is not true. There are a TON of very blah, pointless, and NON-entertaining Crime Thrillers out there, believe me. But, THIS is most definitely NOT one of them...FWIW, here is my take on movies in general. And, I PROMISE not to go on and bore you to death... Simply this No matter WHAT the style, time period, or Genre, a Movie is a Movie. It is either a good movie or a bad movie (or many times something in between) Now, there may be certain TYPES of movies that you just don't like. For example, for me I find no entertainment value in sadistic Torture Porn films. Others may really like them, but I can say that for me personally, categorically I just do not like them. Okay... Some say that the first 'SAW' film was very clever and a new approach to Horror. Fine... I can acknowledge that for that type of film, it is probably one of the best. But, I just don't like those types. So, the same may be true about this film here. Maybe you don't like the more glossy, somewhat stylized Crime Thrillers that were made 15-20 years ago; maybe they just go against your grain and aren't your 'thing'. well, in that case I would say then that it is likely that you may not enjoy this one, unless you really happen to like either or both Keanu Reeves and James Spader.Bottom line... If you happen to like the style of Crime Thrillers made around the this time, it is one of the more entertaining and well made ones. I personally found it quite gripping and it really drew me right into the story. So, if this is your kind of movie, I really don't see how you can miss... It is not especially 'Weighty' or profound, but then neither is it mindless. To me, it sits solidly in the middle where probably the broadest entertainment value is for most people.So... if you are looking for a good, entertaining, well acted and well directed Crime Thriller and you are not just exclusively interested in the newer Darker, moodier Noirish style that kind of predominates Crime Films at the moment, and you can just sit back and enjoy a good Cop / Serial Killer story, then you probably will have a LOT of fun watching this one as I did.

The premise is good, although borrows little parts from other movies of this ilk. Taunted ex cop, Spader has moved to the windy city, on the count of a case involving a serial killer, David Allen Griffin (Reeves) who's tracked him down, and come back out of hiding, ready to begin a new f with you game, cat and mouse, what have you. Reeves's character, void of any emotion, quite an easy thing for this actor to play, plays a cool and cold nutter who watches women for weeks, jots down their routines, studies them, then on that big night, strangles them mercilessly with piano wire. This time around, Spader has Reeves sending him fed ex's with photos of intended victims, then gives him a time ratio to track down these women, solely relying on the evidence of photo, before they're a bloody memory. Pity Spader doesn't check his mail everyday, where Spader's propelled right back into action, teaming up with other authorities to try and nail this psycho, his partner looking like Freeman's good friend from Kiss The Girl's, and Along Came A Spider. The Watcher I must say, is quite an involving psycho thriller, just not as good as the others, but fans of the genre will love it. I really enjoyed this movie. It's very suspenseful in portions of the film, and is bloody too. You really feel sorry for the young women who die at Reeve's hand. Reeves is truly miscast. He's unbelievable and is about as scary as a cool draft. It's one of the worst casting decisions ever made, but there a story behind this. Spader's really good as the taunted cop, the meeting between him and Reeves in the cemetery, funny and interesting, my favorite scene, something you wouldn't expect. For Spader, it's the first time he sees this killer as remaining faceless for his past years in his taunting. I must say, I liked the car chase, and Marissa Tomei as the shrink was solid, but really deserves better material than this. I did really enjoy The Watcher though, but watching Keanu play psycho, is taxing, if torturous, his dancing, throwing a bit of relief into it.

We see less and less of them now, and back when it came out in 2001, in the chronological footsteps of Hannibal, it was an open relief, there was another serial killer pic on standby. The Watcher is fun and totally entertaining, despite a terrible performance from Reeves, as a demented twisted nut who strangles young innocent women, loners, strays runaways, with piano wire, his motives kept under lock and key here. Enter retired and haunted Detective Spader, who was working the case, now reduced to what little life he has, in his new city, seeing a shrink (Marissa Tomei-the best out of the three leads) and dining at the same lousy Vietnamese restaurant. But guess who's back in town on the taunt. Pulled back into action, Spader now works with the cops in tracking down Reeves, who's sending him photographs by envelope of intended murder victims, and so begins a race against time, where Spader's given so many days to find them. Spader's off to a good start as he's not a daily mail checker. By photo, he has to make out the location, then doorknock, etc. There's moments of great intensity, amidst some lashings of heavy gore at times (remember piano wire can really cut deep) and we see Keanu waltz with one of the chosen, before the young stray senses this guys odd, and makes an exit. There's something definitely odd about Keanu's performance. He doesn't even come across as a serial killer, his straight hair that gives him more of an ordinary look. It's probably one of the worst casting decisions I've ever seen in my life. The Watcher does have bits of great suspense, plus an explosive, you would say and cool car chase, that really proves what this nuts capable of. Spader later is summoned by Keanu to a cemetery that provides some funny moments. When Tomei becomes in danger, Spader must save her and kill Keanu and finally puts his demons to rest. A highly entertaining serial killer flick, of course not in the same vein as Hannibal, and with such helpless victims here, who've never done any harm to anybody, it makes you wanna get up and shout at Reeves, and tell him to actually get a life instead of taking one.

This film embodies a certain flare and style that you have to be open minded and somewhat of a serial Killer thriller lover to really appreciate this film style and grandeur of it to see the murky and dark brilliance that lays beneath it all.This movie is not a particularly mind blowing SK thriller but it does have it's moments that it really jumps out at you and there are a few moments in the movie that you just jump in fright and that's when you know your watching a good thriller. Keanu( Who I thought was good in this as the SK but not quite good enough.) turns in a rather impressive performance as David Alan Griffin a man who lives to kill, a man who thrives on taking away another' s life. A man who lurks in the shadows and watches you and admires you like a cat before he kills a mouse Keanu's serial killer was ingenious in his planning and his methods were very smart and clean but what lacked here was the fact that none of his victim's had an adverse affect on the story, that was the only let down but besides that it was interesting to watch him work.James Spader plays a very convincing cop in this film, but not to convincing there are some scenes where you see almost no emotion or empathy for the victims of Griffin at all but that is easy to put to the side what redeems Spader in this film is his relentless chase of Griffin and his iron determination to bring him down. That's what saves Spader and that's what makes it fun to watch him work.Marisa Tomei this film could have done with out she really lowered the standards with her bland and very bad performance as the compassionate Psychiatrist( I mean she won an Oscar for crying out loud!! She can do better than than this!) she really made it almost a drag to see her on screen (but hey at least she's nice to look at.) all in all she was the main weak point in this film not Keanu.When you over look the main outer layers of the story and get dug and see the inner layers you can fully comprehend and see the near greatness of this film and the great style it brings to the the thriller genre all in all The Watcher delivers great edge of your seat, blow out the lights entertainment you can't over look.

It seems to be developing its own facile conventions. The killer communicates with, and taunts, the person pursuing him. Sometimes he may leave clues behind -- based on, let me see, Alice in Wonderland, the seven deadly sins, the methodology of previous serial murderers. The cop's girl friend is dragged into the plot by the hair.It's all very familiar by now and bears as much relationship to reality as the fastest draw in the Western. The ludicrous conventions enter and become embedded in public consciousness. I mean it. Thumbs up/ thumbs down was invented for a silent movie about Rome directed, I think, by DeMille. Nobody on the set knew the proper signals, so they were made up on the spot and now everyone believes them. (Actually, I think the signals varied from one venue to another.) I've heard people who ought to know better attribute to Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto the line, I fear all we have done is awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve. Great line. Invented by the writers of Tora Tora Tora. This uninteresting entry into the serial killer genre has David Spader as the Chicago detective, slightly unhinged by a previous experience with the same killer (blandly handsome Keanu Reeves) in Los Angeles. The pursuit involves multiple car chases, a musical score that pounds the viewer into insensibility, garrotes, an uncannily intuitive murderer, blossoming fireballs, frantic cops, rooftop marathons, and the rest of the usual elements. The girl friend is Marisa Tomei as an unconvincing clinical psychologist, just along for the ride.At one point, Spader the detective lectures Reeves the egomaniacal murderer -- Do you know how many serial murderers are operating in Chicago right now? Five. In the Midwest? Twelve. Why, serial murderers are as thick as fleas on a hound dog's back! I don't really care that they're becoming a cash cow for the movie industry. Some examples, though still restricted to the formula, can have aspirations. Just as there have been good Westerns, there have been good serial murderer movies -- Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer or Seven. Most, like most Westerns, are no more than commercial junk.What really gets me edgy is the possibility that they are altering public beliefs, our entire culture. The Western was irrelevant because it was set safely in the past, but the serial killer may be the guy who drives the diaper truck or that creep who seemed to stare blankly at you on the bus. Is this the sort of thing that will provide us with our arousal jags for years into the indefinable future? Or, let's put it another way. Don't we have enough REAL things to worry about?

I could throw out a litany of plot mistakes(here one minute gone the next etc).The under-development of every character not played by James Spader is inexcusable. When it comes to serial killer films I think the single most important thing is to give depth to the killer. Michael Mann did it in Manhunter... Demme slammed it home in Silence of the Lambs(and he barely had to show Buffalo Bill to do it)....We don't know what makes Keanu demented.... it's been only 12 hours since I watched the movie and I can't even remember the serial killer's name(that's not a good sign)...I know he liked to dance(to bad music mind you) and I know that he is perhaps the dumbest serial killer of all-time.... If the director here did a little research he'd realize that he not only needs to make the killer unique but he needs to give him an I.Q. over 70.This is NOT a good choice.

At once I was completely stuck. I had to rent it and watch it again. Unlike the violent, foul-mouthed cops Hollywood produces 13 to a dozen we are presented with the vulnerable wreck of a man who is asked by his therapist if he wants to live on disability even though he's still young; and then, when his past catches up with him, he's transformed, totally focused. His calm fascinated me.I found the script intelligent, brilliant (if it was based on a novel I would like to read it). For instance in the way they give us small pieces of the catastrophe three years earlier and then leave us to put the jigsaw together, somehow caught up in the stream of consciousness of the hero's mind. And the editing wonderfully underscored the way dreams of past horrors become intertwined with the horrors of the present. Seeing the film for the second and third time I realize how certain themes are hinted at in the dialogue, and how cleverly they let him comment on what is shown -- dreams? past events? what's actually happening? -- even as he speaks. Nothing is irrelevant -- you really should take notice of everything, which is impossible and which is why the film can be seen several times before you catch it all. Or nearly all.What is totally lacking though is an explanation as to how the villain has become the monster he is -- I do like Keanu Reeves, but for this kind of role I think a real actor is needed, like John Malkovich, who plays psychopaths so convincingly.So in spite of this flaw I gave the film the highest vote, for the script, the editing and for the performances of lovely Marisa Tomei and vulnerable James Spader. Simply wonderful.Oh, and I must add, having skipped through the 15 pages with the 142 comments preceding mine, that this seems to be a film most appreciated by women. So for the man thinking of seeing it, be sure to be interested in the psychological side of life before watching. And as a female I see no bonding whatsoever between Campbell and the serial killer, as has been hinted at in other comments -- Campbell only says what he has to say in order to save a life -- he's simply controlling the situation.

Worse the vague connection between the two, re-told in a series of confusing flashbacks leave the audience caring about niether character. Marisa Tomei, although a great comedic talent, doesn't seem convincing enough to portray a licensed psychologist (think Bruce Willis in The Color Of Night).That being said, acting isn't the piece that haunts The Watcher the most it's the direction.

However, it just didn't spark an interest in me. The acting was okay (though a bit unemotional) but I think it is more the fault of a poor script than poor acting. Keanu's part was not over-the-top enough for a crazed killer, and he was certainly not scary. James Spader does a good job as the strung-out cop, but his character was written very inconsistently (e.x. He doesn't want to track Reeves anymore and moves away to avoid him, but when Reeves shows up in Chicago, Spader barely hesitates to get back on the case. He's in the FBI, one would think they could re-locate him somewhere where Reeves couldn't find him if he really wanted to be away). The relationship between Reeves (killer) and Spader (cop)is strange and unclear and way too unemotional (e.x. The graveyard scene Why was Spader so autistic when finally face-to-face with this killer who has been haunting and destroying his life for years?? He doesn't act the least surprised or show any emotion. What's worse is rather than shoot him, Spader gives the killer his gun and gets in the car with him?!?! What the hell??). Marisa Tomei is an academy award caliber actress, yet she is reduced to a screaming ninny; a worn out cliche of the damsel in distress. Her talent is completely wasted. I never felt myself getting lost in the movie or gripped in a moment of suspense or even once said Wow to a scene or situation while watching this movie. The cinematography was competent enough. Its obvious the movie had high production values and the movie included several nice shots of a Chicago areas. The director attempted to be flashy but came off a bit contrived and the movement seemed more like a music video at times rather than a feature film. The music was pretty horrible throughout.However, the main problem obviously was the complete lack of originality in the plot. A wash-out cop with a troubled past and something to prove tracking/maintaining a personal relationship with a killer he has a vendetta against...a cat and mouse game ensues culminating in final showdown, where cop redeems himself and saves the damsel in distress. How many times has this tired plot been hashed out?? Its not a bad plot, it just has been ran into the ground. I suggest rent/buy a better more original movie in the genre like Seven, The Silence of the Lambs, or Citizen X before renting/buying the Watcher. This movie doesn't do anything particularly wrong but then again doesn't do anything particularly new or original with its over-used plot vehicle. MY RATING 5/10 A completely ambivalent experience.

The pace of the editing &#150; and certainly not the wafer-thin storyline &#150; keeps the audience just about interested.

Reeves here plays the bad guy, and he is, well, utterly unconvincing. He is miles away from the deadpan hacker of The Matrix, a role that effectively saved his career. All of which means that his career highlight remains Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure.And then there is the ending embarrassing special effects leave a bad after-taste to what is ultimately a disappointing effort.

But beyond that, The Watcher holds little if any redeeming value, unless you consider Keanu Reeves revealing his dark side as some sort of cinematic event.The real star of this show is James Spader, who plays FBI agent Joel Campbell. In Campbell we're given, at least by Hollywood standards, a complex character, namely a burnt-out gumshoe who relies on barbiturates and psychiatry to deal with some traumatic memories.Said traumatic memories are courtesy of serial killer David Allen Griffin, played by Reeves, who, amongst the many other lives he's snuffed out,  managed to kill an acquaintance of Campbell's in a rather horrific manner back when he lived in Los Angeles. The event causes Campbell to move to Chicago, partly to be closer to the grave of his loved-one, partly to escape Griffin.Alas, Griffin tracks Campbell down to the Windy City and the tormenting begins once more.Although the photos and the deadline add a new wrinkle to the game, the pattern remains largely the same as Griffin starts small, taking the lives of a photo shop clerk and a panhandler, before moving onto a bigger challenge in Campbell's psychiatrist, played by a vulnerable Marisa Tomei.Nothing in this movie rises beyond pedestrian. Both the film-making and the acting are workaday, while the music borders on annoying. In keeping with the basic tenor of this movie, the Rob Zombie selection was ridiculously predictable.Director Joe Charbanic, who makes music videos for his day job, tries to get both artsy and spectacular resulting in a montage of scenes that are completely out of context. We get grainy flashbacks, wonky camera angles, and even grainier `looks through the eyes of a killer' interspersed with police helicopters racing across the city's night-time sky and over-the-top explosions at a gas station and a warehouse -- none of which have never been done before.Spader, meanwhile, sticks to the `hollow version of the man he once was' shtick, while Reeves does no more than hit his marks and deliver his lines. And Tomei's character is little more than a prop for Spader's, starting off as a crying towel and finishing as just one more thing that the two main characters can fight over.All the while, we're supposed to deal with the question of whether protagonist and nemesis can find meaning on their lives only when they're duelling with one another. As a bonus, there's supposed to be a underlying moral to this mess they call a story -- something about urban life, alienation, and keeping an eye out for each other.Whatever. A lot of warts could have been overlooked if a good reason could have been found to make yet another movie about yet another serial killer and the types who chase after these people. But The Watcher has failed to add anything new to what is becoming a very tired genre, and, ultimately, that is the biggest reason to not bother seeing this one.

Could've used fewer Spader flashbacks, and more background on the other characters.

The second thought was not only could I write a better script but direct this movie better than this. There were so many things wrong with this movie, they are too numerous to begin with. The Watcher could have been a good movie but it was not a well thoughtout or planned movie. Keanu Reeves, fresh from his role in The Replacements, was not chilling or convincing as a serial  killer. James Spader as an FBI Agent left something to be desired. Perhaps if the roles had been reversed or the script and direction had been well crafted, this movie would be worth the price of administion but with the numerous problems with this film, it would be lucky enough to garner an initial look without considering a second one.

As for Marisa Tomei, she is hopelessly and criminally under-used and anyone could have played her character. My advice? Don't waste time and money on this.

Yes, the successes of films like 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Se7ven' has saddled us up with an endless series of lame wannabes. A quenched FBI officer (Spader) moves from LA to Chicago after being unable to solve a serial-killer case. The killer (Reeves) follows him and continues his uncanny hobby there. He sends Spader and his new team of coppers a picture of his next target and then gives them until 9pm sharp to prevent her from getting killed. This modus operandi is repeated a couple of times which is quite dull. Although 'The Watcher' features quite a lot of action sequences, there's almost no tension. Instead of tension, we get irritating MTV-style flashbacks and lousy references to Reeves' previous blockbuster 'The Matrix'. The overwhelming music by Marco Beltrami doesn't exactly increase the tension level, neither. On the contrary, I'd say&#133;. The acting is below average. It clearly shows that Reeves didn't really want this project and Marisa Tomei (as Spader's shrink) is wasted.

Campbell moved to Chicago from Los Angeles after the serial killer murdered a woman he was having an affair with & it seems the killer moved with him & begins to taunt him by sending him pictures of his intended victims & giving him several hours to track them down & stop him killing them...Directed by Joe Charbanic one has to say that The Watcher is a throughly average serial killer thriller along the lines of The Silence of the Lambs (1991), Se7en (1995), Kiss the Girls (1997) & The Bone Collector (1999). The script by David Elliot & Clay Ayers takes itself very seriously & is very unremarkable, the whole idea of the killer sending Campbell pictures of his intended victims leaving him in a race against time trying to track them down is a reasonable concept but the second time the killer does it plays out exactly the same as the first time & I must admit I lost interest as it just felt like the film was repeating itself. The pace is alright although I doubt it will make anyone's pulse race, there is just about enough dramatic incident to keep one awake although there are no major plot twists or surprises. The character's are poor, the serial killer is given absolutely no motive whatsoever or any sort of background other than he is a killer while the film tries to set agent Campbell up as a complex character it doesn't follow through on it. All the mental & physical health problems he has & are spelt out at the start are quickly forgotten about, he too isn't given much of a background apart from a short flashback that indicated he was having an affair with one of the killers victims. The whole film just feels so average & routine, the story about a cop trying to catch a killer is nothing new, the character's are stock clich√©s, the fact that the case becomes personal for the cop is par for the course & nothing really stands out, nothing really grabbed my attention or drew me into the story & while The Watcher is by no means the worst film ever made it's utterly forgettable & devoid of any originality.Annoyingly director Charbanic keeps inserting lots of flashbacks at seemingly random points which don't really lead up to much & they are irritatingly filmed as well with a very jerky frame skip type movement to them. In 2001 at the Toronto Film Festival while there to promote Hardball (2001) star Keanu Reeves went on record claiming that a friend of his forged his signature on a contract to do The Watcher & since he couldn't prove it & didn't want a costly lawsuit just did the film anyway. However there is one story that says Keeves agreed to appear in the film in a small cameo before his huge success with The Matrix (1999) at which point the script was rewritten to include his character a lot more which Keeves didn't like & tried to drop out of the film but couldn't. Who knows which story is true. The film doesn't have any real tension & it's not played for scares or horror either, at one point there's a somewhat out of place car chase which ends in a huge explosion.With a supposed budget of about $33,000,000 The Watcher is well made with good glossy Hollywood production values, actually filmed in Illinois in Chicago. The acting isn't that good, Spader phones in his performance, Marisa Tomei is terrible as the love interest while Reeves clearly doesn't want to be there & is just a poor actor to begin with anyway & was nominated for a Razzie award as 2001's worst supporting actor for his performance in The Watcher although he didn't win.The Watcher isn't really worth watching, it's a totally unremarkable by-the-numbers serial killer thriller that doesn't really shock or surprise or grip.

James Spade's performance was also mediocre and tiring and one has to wonder whether he too is getting desperate for work that he would take on a script like this.  I'm sorry,  but The Watcher isn't worth the price of admission to a theatre let alone a video rental.  Watch it for a laugh but when films like these are produced you can understand society's complaint with the direction Hollywood has taken as of late.

You probably saw the preview, like me, and figured it would be scary and full of suspense. The first time I looked at my watch was less than half an hour after it started. Boring, long, and so predictable. Serial killer 101 !!!  Too bad. I was expecting a nice thriller, with lot's of suspense but this is far from it. This is more the story of the detective than the story of the killer himself. Too many things don't make sense also. The detective is sick like hell, but as soon as he gets back on the job he looks like he's never been sick. The filing in the shrink's office is not as per confidentiality rules, and more and more (can't give too many examples without saying too much about the plot)... you'll find out when you see it if you go. If you can go for free (or close), go. But if you have to pay a full $10, choose something else. Even SAVING GRACE is much better.

Im sorry I did. It was boring, full of clich√©. The actors seemed bored and didn't really know what they where doing. I just had to say something. I've read some crappy reviews. And this movie probably got the most of them. I don't understand how anyone could possibly enjoy this film. it is nerve wrecking and dull. I think this movie is most of all for Keanu Reaves fans. And they probably don't know a thing about films (if there fan of Reaves films). So please never let the director of this peace of crap near a camera ever again. He is not worthy.

A necessary DVD for nay conversationalist, chronic whiner.This film is the most pathetic, deplorable and vile 90 minutes caught on film. Jaw-dropping that it got made. It mainly consists of Keanu Reeves looking moody. Avoid at all costs. "},{"Title":"Missed Opportunities","Date":"13 January 2004","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  You know when a movie boasts and Keanu Reeves you're in pretty big trouble.Sometimes I go with the general flow when I put down actors. For example, Adam Sandler doesn't really bother me. He was perfect for Happy Gilmore (which I think is a great mindless comedy). But Keanu Reeves is one actor that I, personally, have never considered a great--much less good--actor. In Bill and Ted and The Matrix he's fine, yes, because he fits the parts given to him (new generation slackers).Speed is one of my all-time favorite action films, but not really because of Reeves himself.The movies in which he is supposed to display true emotions--such as Feeling Minnesota or A Walk in the Clouds--are the ones that bother me, because I know that there are better actors putting on school plays who aren't getting paid--yet he's raking in the millions. Many of his dramatic roles are rather dry and laughable. When it comes to *real* roles, Keanu just fails miserably.I'll explain why, since I'll probably get angry letters from Matrix fans and teenage girls with posters of him on their walls if I don't. My main problem with Reeves is that he's always the same. His face is always the same. His tone of voice. His expressions. His mannerisms. For the sake of comparison, imagine Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Now imagine Keanu Reeves trying to play Raymond Babbitt. See what I mean?In The Watcher, Keanu is a serial killer who toys around with an ex-FBI Agent (James Spader) whose lover Keanu killed years before in a fire. (Bad, Keanu, bad!) In fact, Joel Campbell (Spader) moved all the way to Chicago in order to escape his past, and even retired from the FBI.Now David (Reeves) is back in Joel's life, sending him pictures of victims a day before they are to be murdered. He has twenty-four hours to find them before David does.What a great premise. A pleasant twist on the serial killer routine, right? Err...no, not really. The direction feels like a long action-packed music video--from the opening titles blaring a loud Rob Zombie song to the end, complete with the stereotypical Killer's Point of View that was original in 1978 when John Carpenter's Halloween first invented it (and when it was indeed a very controversial filmmaking technique), but is now getting old since it's frequently being used incorrectly, particularly in the case of The Watcher. Keanu's character seems to see things through some type of strobe music video vision--perhaps that explains his love of music in the film. This is a good song, he says to one victim before strangling her.In all honesty, The Watcher isn't really a truly bad movie (in fact, I've seen much worse), but if I had to pinpoint the problems with The Watcher, it would be these three things1. Direction. Joe Charbanic, a first-time director with his outing in The Watcher, proves that he should never get behind a camera ever again. As I mentioned before, there are just too many moments when I felt that I was watching some music video or product placement commercial instead of a smart serial killer film. Some people just aren't meant to get behind the wheel of a moving car. The same goes for a moving reel of footage.2. The Script. What starts interesting and even compelling soon turns into a routine chase-the-killer film with extravagant car chases and bad character introductions. (Marisa Tomei's student psychiatrist is obviously there for two reasons--to fall in love with the hero and to be kidnapped by the villain. Take a wild guess if it happens or not.) In fact, this film had loads of potential to stand out amongst the rest of its kind by using the original plot--twenty-four hours to find the victim--but it is soon left forgotten and too many plot holes (why wouldn't the victim see herself on TV or on one of the millions of ads placed around Chicago?) are left unchecked.3. The Acting. James Spader is at the very least marginally convincing as a gruff I-Don't-Care-Anymore cop, but he's no Martin Riggs. Instead, he comes off as a whiny, selfish little creep who likes to inject drugs into his body to get a momentary high. This is are hero, folks.Also, is Keanu an invincible boogeyman or not? Lord knows that his mysterious character, David, is untouchable--he survives a foot chase without being seen, he manages to sneak past security cameras and cops and manages to kidnap/kill female victims; he survives a truly ludicrous car chase (that lowered my score for the film by a half a notch), gets shot, caught on fire, and STILL manages to jump out of a window on fire and into a lake? I half expected him to get up once more and give us all one last scare. Honestly, in Halloween, the insinuations of Michael Myers' invincibility were more than hinted at. Here, we are left to wonder whether or not the killer is some type of supernatural force or not. The film is too eager to wrap all the loose ends up without digging deeper into the material.Who knows, next year we could see The Watcher II David's Return. Maybe David will spring back to life as a burn victim's worst nightmare and wreak havoc on the lives of very distant relations. (Maybe we'll even see Freddy vs. Jason vs. David.) What will the tagline for The Watcher II be? Hmm.... How about, This time...it's even more personal than last time. No, thanks, I'll pass.2.5/5 "},{"Title":"Decent cast deliver a D-movie","Date":"6 May 2003","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Horror, Mystery","Review":"  This looks as though it was thrown together in a few hours and the principal cast should be strung up by the toes with piano wire for such a shameless exercise in mercenary role-taking.What's wrong with it? The plot's so full of holes you could grate cheese with it, the soundtrack's awful, the camerawork's irritating, the car chase is a yawn, the characters lack motive, and Keanu Reeves is about as threatening as a granny with a custard pie.What's good about it? Not much, but at least it had the decency to end in under an hour and a half.Note to would-be serial-killer-thriller makers give your psychos a backstory - it makes them mildly interesting. A leather jacket is not a good enough indicator of homicidal tendencies.

His character wasn't convincing in any way, shape, or form. Ditto for James Spader as the tortured cop with something to prove. Everything in the movie is terribly predictable and fits into Hollywood's psycho-loose-in-the-big-city playbook step by step. There's just nothing original here, and most of the dialogue comes across as if it's being read by a junior-high drama class. No intensity. No emotion. No excitement. Nothing.Strange how things turn around. In 1990, I would have bet a pretty penny that -- in 2000/2001 -- James Spader would be a top cinema draw and Reeves would only be doing supportive stuff. Now, the opposite's true.

Paying $8.75 for this movie. James Spader is the hero of this mess, a burnt out ex-FBI agent who can't work, can't sleep, is addicted to any number of pills, and has left the FBI because of his failed investigation of a serial killer (Keanu). But it turns out, the killer misses him (really) and goes to Chicago where Spader is prepared to live out the rest of his life on disability.  Keanu begins to kill again, wasting some very attractive ladies (Proof the serial killer is insane)! Of course, the FBI welcomes Spader back instantly, no questions asked, without even need of a doctor's okay. So he  quickly transforms from Dennis Hopper to become Jack Webb. After looking like a bum the first half of the movie, suddenly his shirts are clean and crisply pressed, his hair coiffed to Duchovny-like perfection. But I digress. Keanu sends Spader pictures of the victims before he kills them. The pictures are very well lit and expertly framed, suggesting his character might have a future in commercial photography. But no! He wants to kill women. Jerk. So Spader must race against the clock to save them.Besides getting the feeling we've seen all this before, obviously the filmmakers do not know Chicago very well. For one thing, they go looking for one of the victims at a crowded shopping mall at 9pm. Don't think so. Chicago is a working town. The malls are not packed at 9pm.  They are closed. At one point, Spader walks across the street and a car almost hits him. He expects the car to stop for him. Ha! That might be true in La-la-land, where people get tickets for jaywalking, but in Chicago they let you cross at your own risk. Anyone dumb enough to step in front of a speeding auto deserves what he gets. They also report the killer is hiding out 20 miles north of downtown Chicago, then show he's in the Wrigley Building. Come on! Proof the filmmakers could not write and chew gum at the same time.As for Keannu, he  must have lost a bet. He would have been better off preparing for Matrix II or III or VII.
