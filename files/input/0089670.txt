But it still had a great amount of a laughter. I can't believe that some people really didn't like this film. Don't you have moments where you just want to sit down and laugh? Don't think, just laugh and have a good time with the film? The Griswalds are back and they are in Europe! They have won an excellent trip to London, Paris, Germany(they don't state where), and Rome. Of course they do manage to get into trouble, otherwise it wouldn't be a comedy. Clark still has the father-knows-best policy and becomes more obsessed with having a good time with the family than listening to them and their ideas. Ellen has become a famous naked model in Europe because of some undeleted footage that was stolen from Clark on his camera. Rusty is opting for a lot of booty in Europe and Audrey just won't shut up about a not all that boyfriend, Jack.This movie has non-stop laughter that you have to admit is catchy. They did recycle some jokes from the first, but I think you need to let go and have some fun.

OK, so it's not a great work of art, but I thought it was side-splittingly funny in places, and cleverly parodies all the national stereotypes that people tend to use.As a great fan of visual humour, my favourite moment in the film has to be the scene where, having had all their clothes stolen, the family go shopping in a boutique in Italy and emerge on to the street dressed in absurdly over-the-top designer creations.  It really is one of the funniest sights I have ever seen in a film.  I defy anyone with a sense of humour not to laugh.

I watched both films back-to-back and in the end  I've got to concede that I like the original Vacation more than it's sequel.  I think the  two films are equally funny, but the first one has a little more originality to it and a  slightly better cast.  Don't get me wrong though, European Vacation IS a funny movie  and a very good sequel, but just not as good as the original.Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo of course, play the parts of Clarke and Ellen Griswold  (although spelled Griswald in this film for whatever reason) perfectly.  The parts of  Rusty and Audrey Griswold were re-cast (for whatever reason) with Jason Lively and  Dana Hill.  I thought Jason Lively was a fine replacement for Anthony Michael Hall, and  even slightly resembles him.  Although, I was less than impressed with Dana Hill.  Not  that she did a bad job acting, but more that her character seemed quite different and  didn't resemble the original Audrey (Dana Barron) at all.  It was nice to see both Eric Idle  and Robbie Coltrane in the film (both playing very small roles).European Vacation was a good film and a nice sequel, but still not as good as the  original.  Although, I would strongly recommend you take a look at this film if you liked  the original or just like Chevy/Beverly.  Chevy Chase is great, as is Beverly D'Angelo,  both make the film well worth the time I put in watching it and I hope they'll make your  time worth it as well.

First time around Clark had a goal, a destination, and pay-off for the audience when he finally got there. Second time around he's just wandering aimlessly from country to country, and it doesn't make for great entertainment I'm afraid.The Griswold's win the grand prize in a humiliating TV show called 'Pig in a Poke' and are sent to England, France, Germany, and Italy on an all expenses paid trip. The bulk of the humor is a scatter-shot approach to comedy that abuses tired clich√©s and cultural stereotypes for quick, easy, cheap laughs.Director Amy Heckerling may have used the first Vacation as a reference, but she doesn't have the control over the film that Harold Ramis did, and frequently allows the actors to ad-lib with the assumption that whatever they do might be funny. Even comedy actors need direction, and Heckerling's poor effort ruins many scenes that had potential. Even her camera placing and angles seem awkward and unbalanced. The grainy, low-key photography is also completely inappropriate for a film featuring such a wide range of scenery. Her use of stock footage is bad too (a shot of the Statue of Liberty shows no Twin Towers of the WTC, which were built in 1972!), and heightens the slapdash nature of the production. A few scenes seem to be edited out of order too, which leads me to believe that the script flowed a little differently before being rewritten (Clark leaves the London hotel, moves literally five feet down the street, then asks for directions back to the hotel).John Hughes' influence on the script was obviously minimum. Vacation and Christmas Vacation were ficionalised accounts of his own family's experiences. But European Vacation feels like a quick cash-in on the original's success, and co-writer Robert Klane doesn't know how to inject the pathos and satire that was so easy for Hughes.The European trip is definitely lagging far behind Walley World, Christmas and Las Vegas. A better director and a tighter script would have saved it. But Chase is as watchable as ever, and the only reason to sit through this poorly-made drivel.

The first film chronicled the events in the life of Clark W. Griswold, Jr., and how he tried to get to Walley World with his family.Now, the cast is back (well, Chevy Chase and D'Angelo, at least), for a sequel that is familiar to the first, but nowhere near as funny.After winning a prize on John Astin's `Pig in a Poke' gameshow, Clark Griswald (spelled with an `a' in this film instead of an `o') and family head out for a tour of Europe, which includes backing into Stonehenge (we saw it coming), driving on the wrong side of the road, getting trapped in the Big Ben roundabout, and a running gag about battered tourist Eric Idle, whom Clark runs over, punches, slaps, runs over again, etc&#133;It's odd how the humor changed in these films. The first, written by John Hughes, was not exactly slapstick but just funny. Same for the second. And then, the third, `Christmas Vacation,' also written by Hughes, did a 180. The humor in it was completely different from the first; anyone who disliked the first would probably love `Christmas&#133;' And then there was `Vegas Vacation,' which was the most underrated sequel. However, I think the WORST sequel is `European&#133;'Many of the jokes fall flat. Let's face it. And the kids&#133;Jason Lively is decent as Rusty, but the girl who played Audrey is one of the most annoying child actors I have ever seen. Chevy Chase seems the most held back from all his other `Vacation' films. Clark just doesn't seem like Clark all the time.Beverly D'Angelo is about the same as she usually is there's no complaining from me on her account.But most of those things account for how bad the film is; HOWEVER, I have a theory of why it is so underrated&#133;You have to have lived in Europe to understand many of the in-jokes and gags. If you haven't, you just won't get half of them. I have lived in Europe around seven years before, and I must say that many of the jokes were for those that have either toured or lived in Europe for an amount of time.John Hughes is listed as writing this film, but actually, he didn't. He got credit for co-writing because he created the characters. I just thought I should make that point since many people don't. If you don't believe me, read www.geocities.com/johnsmovieportal2003/hughesinterview. John Hughes says `I didn't write them! I swear!' in regards to the `European' and `Vegas' films.All in all, I have to tell you that `European Vacation' was a major blow to the series, mainly because it failed on all levels we expect from a `Vacation' film. However, when the credits rolled, I still got that same distinct feeling I got when the other films were over a bit of relief and sadness. I'm not sure why, to tell you the truth. It's something about the way they play the credits. I think it's just because I like the `Vacation' films so much that no matter how bad one of them is, the others are so good it makes me happy.So, yes, it's not a great movie, but it's not a horrible movie, either. I'm glad I watched it. It's the worst of the series, but not an awful movie in any aspects.3/5 stars &#150; maybe 2.5 on a lesser day -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"European Vacation 6/10","Date":"7 February 2003","Score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  `Pig in a Poke' is the newest game show in the US.

Why, none other than our favorite family the Griswalds (spelled differently in this one than the others)! After a close competition with resident champions the Froegers, they win a European vacation. Audrey (Dana Hill) doesn't want to leave behind her boyfriend Jack (William Zabka), and Rusty (Jason Lively) just doesn't want to go. They do, reluctantly, but this two week vacation doesn't go without a hitch.2nd released in the series, and usually considered least of the series, which I go with. Simply, it's not as funny as the others Vacation, Christmas Vacation, and Vegas Vacation. It tries to be more raucous and irreverent than the others. It doesn't have a central grasp on any one plot. They go across Europe, but there's nothing that connects all of the destinations. For instance, in Vacation there was Aunt Edna; Christmas Vacation, it actually had a real plot, and in Vegas Vacation there were a few subplots, but they all went through.All that isn't to say that it wasn't funny, it's just not as funny as the other three. As heard from Chevy Chase on the subpar DVD commentary, he wishes to do another Vacation movie. I would like to see that. Many of the laughs came from slapstick and pratfalls, which aren't my favorite types of humor. Some of them were predictable (they go to Stonehenge&#133;guess what?), but some of the gags (like on the train to Rome) were nice.The MPAA wrongly gave this movie its PG-13 rating. It most definitely should have been rated R. The writers, which include veteran John Hughes, must have tried to keep the humor in the PG-13 range, because they didn't `rough it up' as much as they wanted to.One last thought if there was an earlier movie version of Chicago, Beverly D'Angelo would have been perfect as Roxie.My rating 6/10Rated PG-13 for sustained scenes of nudity, sexual situations, teen drinking and language.

Not really so with this one. Yes the first was classic, funny, and hard to beat, with a whole lot of reality hidden under Clark's escapades and misadventures. Much the reality that we can relate to was the beauty of that film. What works here, of course not scoring as many laughs as the original, is the change of location, or should say the change of locations, as The Griswalds win a trip to Europe, all by accidentally winning a round on a game show, up against a real genius, and unbeatable family, up until now. Even though this has been dissed, I never had a problem with this one where again, there's a lot of reality here, we can relate too, when going away, one especially, involving running up a phone bill. Here of course, Clark creates chaos and misunderstanding as remember, he's in Europe. They even visit the wrong address of relatives, who of course, are strangers to these wild family on the account of a half veiled address number. Another misunderstanding which resulted in a chase was the German dancing. Oh did I forget, they visited Germany as well. We have different actors replace Rusty and Audrey, as in all the Vacation series, and there are a few cameos from some English greats. I thought the bit with poor bicycle rider Idle was sick though, on the account of the 'wrist squirting blood' moments. The writer or writers here have really honed in on picking out funny happenings and situations, where for me this was a potpouri of laughs from a potpouri of laughs from a potpouri of cities, which made this one work. Even on return, the Griswalds cause the plane to knock the statue of liberty off.

After having had a short look on the director's biography I unfortunately have to suppose that this movie might reflect her personal clich√©s...For people who believe these stereotypes to be more or less reliable At least at the time this movie was released (1985/86) it was the so polite Britons who in Europe had a reputation problem (due to their ultra violent hooligans-remember the Heysel stadium tragedy) Nevertheless the clich√©s in this movie appear rather harmless,especially regarding the movie's age (if someone wants to watch really dumb national stereotypes,I recommend the British top gear)Where did the Schuhplattler dance take place IN THE MOVIE? (in reality these scenes were shot in Southern Tyrol,Italy,as you know) Well,I can only say that there are shown many little blue-white flags (blue-white the colors of Bavaria) and red-white flags (red-white the colors of Upper Austria,a federal state of Austria) And there's shown a big German (at that time only West-German!) flag (black-red-gold).So everybody can brood over it,if she or he wants...I suggest a Schuhplattler contest between Bavarian and Upper Austrian towns near the border.By the way,Hitler's birthplace Braunau is also a town near to the Upper Austrian/Bavarian border.A strange coincidence,isn't it? Therefore I suspect that the oddly high number of flags in this Schuhplattler-town is an allusion to the Reichsparteitag in Nuremberg...Finally,what concerns the nudity in this movie Come on,this is European vacation and not Saudi Arabian vacation!

The vacation has a problematic beginning (staying in a hotel that's not as good as advertised), and for the Griswalds, it only gets worse. Unlike in Vacation, there is no specific destination the family is trying to reach, though there are references to some past events once they reach their final destination (Rome). Some of the things they discover in Rome are the following(1) Before leaving home Clark made a video of Ellen, which she wanted him to erase. It becomes clear that the recording was not erased. (2) Throughout the movie Audrey has complained about leaving Jack. She sees him, or someone very similar to him, with another girl from a distance. (3) The bike rider Clark ran over in London shows up. It turns out that the accident caused more than a flesh wound.My least favorite thing about the movie is Audrey complaining about being away from Jack (who didn't care much about her), especially because it happens at every destination.

They win the grand prize a free trip to Europe! Clark was totally stoked about going. Ellen was excited too, but Rusty and Audrey could care less. Audrey was in to her new boyfriend, Jack, and talked endlessly about him.         Pretty soon, they board the plane to England and each have fantasies about European life. In London, they check into their hotel, where the TV only get's only one show The History of Cheese. Next day, they drive around town. Clark was not used to UK driving and nearly kills everyone. He also runs into bike rider Eric Idle. Before long, it's time to go. They see Stonehenge and leave it unhinged. Next, on to France, where they get a load of the cultures and the Eiffel Tower. Clark's video camera is stolen. They go on to Germany to visit Clark's relatives. They go to the wrong house and take complete strangers as Helga and Fritz. They then go to Oktoberfest where Clark narrowly escapes being lynched. They board the train to Italy and along the way, Rusty and Audrey moan and complain about the whole trip.         In Italy, two criminals take over a customer service place and place the real owner in the trunk of a rental car the Griswalds take. With the money they got there, they decide to go buy some new clothes. They try on an assortment of interesting threads. Now personally, I think Clark should've gone with the second brown hat he picked up and that brown jacket he had trouble lacing. Those were the best ones. They even run into Eric Idle again. The next day, Ellen is kidnapped by one of the criminals right after seeing that a porno movie of her was made by the man who stole the camera. Apparently when Clark made a dirty video of her and promised to erase it, he didn't. Clark goes after her and the bad guys are taken to jail and the Griswalds head back to America!

All depictions of Europeans are one-dimensional and almost universally not funny at all (like how the English are SOOO polite).Apart from a few scenes, there's hardly a laugh in sight and the ending turn this one into complete slapstick. But if you're a Chevy Chase fan (like myself) the film is watchable, but no more than that.

Those who blame the actors for this turkey aren't being fair; the actors to blame are those who could have killed the script - Chevy Chase and possibly Beverly D'Angelo.Simply put, the material isn't funny. A lot of it is stupid physical comedy, lame jokes and stuff that I wonder why anyone thought was funny, and way too much of the last. (The flight scene in Germany, and subsequent train trip, for example). And they should have gone all the way with the dog, like in UHF.There are some briefly funny parts in the movie, most of which were the family trying to communicate who didn't speak their language. Eric Idle added a slighly Monty Pythonesque note to the movie, which I found out of place, but was slighly funny.I'm not to usually blink at vulgarity and nudity, but Ich weiss nicht doch is not Beats the s**t out of me (the mandatory subtitle) and obsenity is out of character for that particular character. (It's closer to I really don't know.) There are a number of instances of topless nudity and sex jokes, which would be better excused if they were funny.If you're looking for a better Dana Hill comedy then European Vacation, I suggest Combat High; if you're looking for a better Vacation movie, Christmas Vacation (my favorite) or the original Vacation are better; Vegas Vacation was a failure.

It has a lot of new places and doesn't just stick around from the first film, travelling across Europe the Griswold family get up to more crazy hijinks and basically ruin everything for anyone that comes there way. I thought it was safely a kind of OK movie, and here Is why.The story is as crazy as the first and never really stops trying the same thing, you could say this is what makes this not the best comedy, but the old jokes still sure do work. It is fast paced and they move around very quickly from place to place, it doesn't affect it but it can be hard to establish characters they come across who just seem like they are all cameos. It has it's moments of jokes, not too many but no jokes annoy so it doesn't quite ever get to be a bad movie.Chevy Chase is good in the movie, his funny acting skill is slightly drowned out by some poor writing and direction but he still does a good job to be the head of the family. I found the rest of the family poor and the two new children actors who took over from the first films originals just aren't funny, it lacks the one liners the first two children brought to us. I liked the cameos we do see they are funny, don't work so well as I previously said but still add to the humour.I'm sad to say Amy Heckerling doesn't do to good of a job here, I think one reason people disliked this movie at the time was because of her direction, she doesn't do enough to bring the laughs out of the scenes. John Hughes has massive talent in comedy writing and even stronger when writing cross country trip comedies, and he doesn't do BAD here, just not great either, the words are the funniest part of this movie and chuckles can be had but I expected much better from such a legend of comedy writing.My main criticism as can be seen is the lack of jokes, they are there yes but don't often come out and when they do you could already be hating the film. Starts very slow and although it does get into a nice rhythm, Chase can't do enough to make it good enough. I also disliked the timing, bit too short or maybe the scenes are too short, much more could have been done in timing the film.I think those who liked the first film will enjoy this, nowhere near as much but you still get some genuine laughs and if you heard it is bad, then you may feel guilty because you will laugh. It has a lot of slapstick type jokes, so for those who dislike that kind of thing stay away for good. This film seems almost as if the family don't bond at all so it could be said if you like dysfunctional comedies.Overall it is a Safely OK-ish Movie, nowhere near being Good let alone OK but still more than just your average comedy, well in my opinion. I think some may hate this, some may love it, it depends on whether you think you have such a thing as class when it comes to movie. Don't think into this film too much and it could have you in stitches, if you do, you may despise it.

I chalk that up to an increase in slapstick and zany situations, plus an almost total withdrawal from the quieter character moments that grounded the family's first vacation. While the original film definitely had its silly tendencies, it also seemed to know when to tighten the reins and slow down a bit, while the European chapter is content to keep plowing straight ahead, often leaping well beyond the limits of belief. There are definitely some rich laughs to be had, particularly when Clark participates in a traditional Octoberfest dance or a French waiter speaks his mind via subtitles, but my favorite bits always seem to involve the family's personalities ricocheting off of each other and those take a clear back seat to the puns and sight gags this time around.

The story starts with the Griswolds on a very strange game show, I can not really say what is similar as the contestants are dressed as pigs. Sort of a trivia type game show mixed with family feud as the Griswolds must face this super smart family. This particular show comes equipped with a slightly perverted host played very well by Sean Astin. Well somehow the Griswolds win and are off to Europe where they will get to spend some time in quite a few European countries. It starts out with a bang in merry old England and quite frankly this is the funniest section of the movie. France I believe follows, then I think Germany and finally Italy. The husband and wife are back as Chevy Chase and Beverly DeAngelo play there roles very well. The two kids here are different, and not quite up to the last two children they still do fairly well. You get some other stars as well, just not up to the first movie, still Eric Idle of Monty Python fame has one very memorable scene on his bike. So as for laughs there are quite a few, granted this one is not as realistic as the first movie. Still, you get some great scenery as you get to see Europe and you also get to see a boob or two in this one which I find odd as this one somehow managed a pg-13 rating despite a bit of female nudity. I mean the first one was rated R and granted it had more cussing, this one still had more nudity which is usually also an automatic R. So all in all not quite as good as the first film it is still a very good trip type comedy.

Of course, the big difference in all the sequels. Their kids is always played by different actors. Chase and D'Angelo are a hoot as always as the slow-witted husband and the long suffering wife. Perphas the problem in the sequel that the kids are less appealing in this one, they played their roles fine. But they are not as enjoyable or funny from the first one and the later sequels. It is also notable for the amusing cameos from John Astin, Paul Bartel, Mel Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Eric Idle and more. Also the sense of humour are not always spot on and some viewers might find it sexist, especially coming from a female director.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.781) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono Sound. DVD special features are an decent commentary by Chevy Chase. Which he does his best by making the commentary enjoyable, despite some dead air. D'Angelo should have joined him in the commentary track. DVD also includes the original theatrical trailer and cast & crew information. I find European Vacation to be weakest of the series. I still enjoyed over the years but i think this one, it is the most dated of the four movies. Fans of the Vacation Series will certainly love it.

For what is less than a 90 minute film (if you consider the time for the credits) it has several montages to music that are neither needed nor funny. The characters were not believable. Yes, it's comedy and the characters and their situations may be unrealistic but you should be able to generate a willing suspension of disbelief. Both kids found relationships that did not fit their characters at all.Many situations were repeated in different cities with diminishing returns. Also, this movie probably should have been rated R for the nudity. As it was an early PG-13 I believe they were still trying to figure out the rating system at that time. See the IMDb Parental Advisory for more details.I will likely use this DVD as a coaster or attempt to sell it at a garage sale (which is where I got it). It is not worth wasting the 90 minutes to watch it. If you want to see a funny scene with Eric Idle, watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail---it is much funnier.

This time Amy Heckerling (Look Who's Talking) helms what turns out to be a disastrous comedy which will annoy you more than it will make you laugh.Hughes script (with Rob Klane) is awful and you wonder why the likes of Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo bothered with such a dead-beat project, as even Anthony Michael Hall and Imogene Coca had the sense to decline the offer. Even an omnipotent Michael Palin is unable to lift proceedings to any level that one could call entertaining.Yet, as inconceivable as it may seem, European Vacation was successful enough to warrant a second sequel!

For some reason, the entire movie seems to focus on the darker side of humor (stereotypes and some very fluffweight satire that never works).  Alone, the movie could have worked except for the constant and annoying references to the first film--Clark's sweatshirt in Paris and the same incidental music.  Here's one word of advice for all future filmmakers whenever you do a sequel, it's always best if you don't put any references to the first and possibly better movie!Then we get to the acting (or non-acting) of the two kids in this movie. Despite being completely unlikable, they are also quite hard on the eyes.  In fact, I can't look at Dana Hill in this movie without wincing. It's not the weight she had to lose, it was either the makeup man, the cameraman, or a great deal of reconstructive surgery.  She's easily one of the worst things about this movie and the hackjob the writers did on her character by making her a constant whining jerk don't help either.  But she narrowing beats out the hideous thing that plays Rusty.  Considering when this was made, I don't see why they couldn't how they couldn't throw another bottle of JD at Anthony Hall and have him appear in his original place.Then the script.  As I said before, the 'satire' is quite pointless and seems to make up the entire movie where the original drew humor from the settings.  It's pretty damn sad, and this movie deserves to be the black sheep of the bunch.  You know it's a stinker when Randy Quaid breathes a sigh of relief that he missed this mess.Bottom line  AVOID at all costs.  There is a reason why the box art for this movie looks a lot like the original  don't be conned into seeing a lot of ugly second-string actors run through the paces just to cash in on an unsuspected hit.

European Vacation is not one of them. The follow-up to Hughes' first big hit Vacation (1983), is about as predictable, unfunny and annoying as they come -- no matter how much you love the dumb but romantic Clark and Ellen Griswold (Chase and D'Angelo).I greatly enjoyed Vacation as well as the third film, 1989's Christmas Vacation, but the Griswold's trip to Europe is bland and forced. Perhaps because this was Hughes' first attempt at a sequel that he didn't get it, but it's really dumbfounding how uninspired and devoid of a story European Vacation is. There is no through story the Griswolds win a game show for being greedy little pigs and go on a tour of Europe through England, France, Germany and Italy. Even the screwball physical humor that is the trademark of the first loses all effect because you see it coming, which is part director Amy Heckerling's fault. The Fast Times at Ridgemont High director sets everything up too predictably.Maybe it was Hughes taking a cheap shot because he was put up to the sequel. European Vacation takes great pride in insulting Americans (recall the greedy little pig game show they win), especially tourists, represented by the cornball Griswold family. It also pats itself on the back implicitly saying oh us Griswolds, we're always getting into something because our dad is an idiot. Then in nearly comic fashion it ends with a tribute to America and how grateful the Griswolds are to return to such a better country. If Hughes was going for satire and meant to do it in the form of a bad movie, well maybe I should award this 8/10 stars.It's not just the unfunniness, but European Vacation boasts the two worst actors to play kids Rusty and Audrey (Jason Lively and Dana Hill). They're both annoying and obnoxious, with the unattractive and loud-mouthed Audrey blubbering about the boyfriend she's left behind nearly the entire film. Hughes even goes as far as to have her comment about missing him right as she observes a giant bratwurst. Quite tasteful. Speaking of, breasts are flashed in two different scenes for no good reason (unless it was to comment on Americans' love of gratuitous nipples in their comedies).I will give the film one of its two stars thanks to Eric Idle of the Monty Python crew, whose cameo at a few different points in the film where he recites lines directly from Holy Grail is about the funniest part. If Hughes intended for us to find one of the film's only non- American actors as the only funny part, then another tip of the hat to him for ripping open the underbelly of Hollywood comedy in the '80s. Still, would it have hurt for him to do that while making it entertaining?

That's not a feeling you get everyday, especially with a 30 year-old movie you've just recently seen for the first time.As a sequel, it's not a patch on the original; the kids are inconsistent, the family's unbelievably hapless and the jokes don't work.

This is largely an unfunny comedy that, despite best intentions, suffers from a weak script in which almost all of the laughs are predictable in the extreme and can be spotted a mile off. This means that the actual laugh factor is low, because genuine laughs are few and far between.The story is a light one in which Chevy Chase and his family spend two weeks travelling around various destinations in Europe. There are the expected cultural and fish-out-of-water laughs here, but I appreciated that most of the humour comes from the 'dumb Americans on holiday' stereotypes. Chase and D'Angelo are great value as the parents, the kids less so; Jason Lively (NIGHT OF THE CREEPS) tries hard but his character is unappealing, while Dana Hill is plain over the top and annoying.The good thing about these movies is that they're fast paced, although European Vacation does slow down for the laboured climax which is the worst part of the entire movie. Still, there are some good bits here, mainly involving the likes of cameoing stars such as Eric Idle, Robbie Coltrane, John Astin, and Paul Bartel. "},{"Title":"Funny Comedy That Falls Flat","Date":"29 March 2015","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" In 1983, National Lampoon's Vacation was commercial success. The slapstick comical elements marked a positive outlook on the Griswolds as they became America's most beloved dysfunctional family. So instead of resting on their laurels for at least three or four years for a possible sequel, Warner Brothers decided to bring them back to the screen two years too early with National Lampoon's European Vacation. After winning a game show hosted by John Astin (Addams Family's Gomez Addams), the Griswolds win a trip to Europe as they embark on several misadventures as the explore the vast landscapes and the cultural settings for them. Sure like the other Vacation series, the plot is very thin, but the story itself was very inferior to its predecessor and the laughs were blatantly pedestrian and aside from that the characters also felt jilted as they went from the typical unlucky family to just plain old American idiots that give the wrong impression that Americans are ignorant to European culture. It didn't help that all the performers returned for the sequel, as Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold, however when Anthony Michael Hall was asked to reprise his Rusty Griswold character, he rebuffed and chose to do the 1980's cult classic Weird Science. They didn't bother asking Dana Barron if she wants to reprise the Audrey Griswold character. They hired new performers for the kids. Jason Lively was not very good in his role as Rusty as he comes across as goofy, awkward and over-the-top with his perverted ways which comes off more stupid than comical. Dana Hill was a better replacement for Audrey than Dana Barron because there is more depth to her character in spite of repetitively lamenting over abandoning her new boyfriend, Jack (William Zabka). Chase goes a bit beyond the role of Clark here as the somewhat easily disgruntled father, here as Clark he comes across as a complete moron who can't do anything right and seems to cause destruction towards everything he touches and everyone around him feels his wrath. D'Angelo meanwhile stays persistent and didn't change that much in the movie as the level-headed matriarch trying to keep Sparky and the kids from insanity. Eric Idle as talented as he is for comedy has a very thankless role as an unfortunate Englishman that the Griswolds keep running over. It's never explained how he always runs into them in England, France and Italy, the irony itself is quite disturbing. What hurt this film badly was that comedy director the late Harold Ramis was too busy starring in Ghostbusters that he wasn't reached to direct. So instead Amy Heckerling who was still living on the coattails of the cult classic Fast times at Ridgemont High took over the director's chair. Heckerling's flair of comedy seems more concrete, which sadly takes over from the craziness from the over Vacation films. The fantasy sequences in the film work pretty good, however, I too felt it was inspired by other bodies of work Heckerling has done before or some other project she had in mind.I'm not playing the blame game entirely on Miss Heckerling as John Hughes returns to the scene as the scriptwriter, however I think there was some dispute that erupted as Mr. Hughes must have walked out at some point because there are a lot of surreal slapstick moments that doesn't feel like the John Hughes films we're all familiar with. The first Vacation film was funny because the situations faced by the Griswolds are something we could get the gist of. The humour delivered here comes off clich√©d, and borderline tasteless. The silliness can be quite cringing with its racist overtones that the humour can be very disturbing at times. Are British people always this nice and genteel all the time? Are the French always dismissive and rude? Are Germans always aggressive and stiff? The scenes that made me laugh are scenes that had similarities to the ones from Vacation. When the Griswalds interact among themselves the comedy comes across nicely. But when they're interacting with foreign policies it's actually poorly executed. The ending of this film was too rushed and also quite uninteresting you would miss the ending even if it came out to bite you. Aside from that I thought that this movie deserved an R rating rather than a PG-13. There's a lot of swearing, nudity and a myriad of hedonistic scenes that go beyond a PG-13 film. Several of the swearing was dubbed to avoid it from being an R rated movie, just in case you invite the young kiddies to see this film. Better yet, avoid the kids from seeing this movie and rent Christmas Vacation instead. There's foul language, but very minimal and used for more comic effect. I was a bit appalled that the family's last name was Griswald in this movie instead of the normal spelling Griswold. It wasn't the downfall for Miss Heckerling as she went on to direct the 1989 film Look Who's Talking while that same year Chase, D'Angelo and Hughes collaborated to make the far superior Christmas Vacation. Even though this movie wasn't the best addition to the Vacation series it wasn't a complete failure and if you could refrain from taking this film seriously or offensively, it can be quite enjoyable.

Chevy Chase is still one of the best comedians of the 80s, and he never disappoints at the role of an obsessed father, focused on giving his family the best vacation ever, but he fails every time! The first three films are some of the funniest movies I've ever seen in my lifetime! European Vacation, however, had some of the most funniest moments ever. From knocking over the stones of Stonehenge, to staying in the smallest hotel in all of England, to Eric Idle's hilarious three scenes only performance as an injured bike rider, seen frequently throughout the film. You'll find yourself laughing at the original one-liners, and all the hilarious situations. Do yourself a favor, and see this movie, along with all the other movies!
