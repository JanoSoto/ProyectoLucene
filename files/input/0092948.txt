If you go back and watch Richard Pryor's live in Concert or Here and Now you see that Eddie used some of Pryor's stuff, but gave it its own shot of himself (In delirious, Murphy does the bARBQ scene/story and he describes his aunt falling down the steps. It is the exact same description Pryor does in Live in Concert when he describes black women at funerals.) RAW used all the things that made Eddie Murphy famous; his deadon imitations, and his gift for telling stories. I can't even watch Martin Lawrence, DL Hughely, Cedric the Entertainer and a few others without noticing Eddie Murphy's influences right away. People forget how big he was, and how good- wayyy before he started doing bad talking animal movies. There are some debates over which was better Raw or Delirious....they are both hilarious, but you can tell the mindset was much different only 4 years later. In RAW, Murphy compares himself to Johnny Carson, while in Delirious he was just the most popular guy on Saturday Night Live. RAW is one of the best and funniest concert comedies ever, and I dare someone not to laugh out loud when watching it......NOTE This movie was reviewed in 1987 when it came out by Siskel and Ebert AT The Movies, which was when they were getting really popular in syndication, and it spurred one of the best on-air disagreements between the two EVER. Siskel likened RAW, and Eddie Murphy overall, as being as funny (or funnier)and outrageous as Pryor, Carlin or Lenny Bruce. He loved the movie. Ebert despised it, and chastised Siskel for being immature and he also felt that Murphy's attitudes toward women were patronizing, damaging and even went so far as to call RAW a pale imitation of a good comedienne. I thought Ebert was nuts at the time, and now that Siskel is dead, I can't find any review of RAW on Ebert's website. I've emailed him numerous times about it, trying to figure out why a movie that was so popular, and not even that long ago, would not be in his database. Does anyone else thinks that sounds fishy?

He also does impressions of what I can only surmise has to be a real life phone call from Bill Cosby.  This is one of the funniest parts of the show as his voice and idiosyncrisies of Bill are right on.  His ensuing conversation with Richard Pryor is also quite funny.There is also some great bits in here about women, dating, and marriage.  And while many people have claimed that Eddie is nothing but a misogynist with his rantings now, it has to be said that there has to be some truth to what he is ranting about.  The show does lack a little near the end but that is okay because the rest of the show is one hilarious skit after the other.

If you haven't seen either, you should consider watching Raw first, even though it was chronolgically second in the series.  Raw is funny at times, but the pacing was off.  Eddie seems tired in his delivery, and the camera work was a bit shoddy.  The camera is zoomed in too far for most of the show and plays catch-up with Eddie for the duration of the set.  Part of Eddie's genius is how he uses his whole body to convey his comedy, and the camera robs us of this performance by only showing him from his chest and up.You can also tell that Eddie has grown up a bit from watching this.  He is talking more about relationships and life instead of reliving memories from his childhood (which was the really, really funny stuff from Delirious).I don't want to discourage anyone from watching this, as it is still one of the best stand up routines of all time.  I would put it at number 7 or 8 of all time, but only because Delirious takes up the top 6 spots (yes, it is that funny).

It goes without saying that his material is relentlessly foulmouthed and occasionally offensive but it rarely bothered me because he does manage to be consistently funny throughout the show. His topics are mostly in the realm of relationships in regards sex and women generally. This worried me a little bit because these topics hardly offered much in the way of originality but actually he did really well with it.It wasn't that he avoided clich√©s (because he doesn't) but more that he manages to inject energy into his whole show. At times his material is very strong but even when he is being obvious and crude, his energy lifts it, engages the audience and makes it feel better than it is. I wasn't rolling with laughter all the time but I did really enjoy the show so, even when I didn't laugh at some bits, it wasn't really a problem but he was generally still amusing. Director Townsend doesn't really help him by having the camera tight on him so much either; Murphy's energy is in his whole body so the close shots reduce this somewhat &#150; plus the whole setup makes it hard to appreciate the audience being in the room.Overall though a funny and energetic show from Murphy. It isn't a classic by any means and his material is hardly original but he has stage presence and energy and that helps a lot. Maybe too crude and foulmouthed to be to everyone's tastes but if it is your thing then it is worth a look.

After all, I'm a fan of everything Eddie Murphy did in the 80's, and RAW was one of the few holes still left unfilled. Then, lo and behold, yesterday it turned up on Finnish TV, and I sat down to watch it.I wasn't expecting too much, so I didn't feel disappointed. Eddie doesn't talk about as many subjects as you'd expect from a 90 minute film, so mostly he just drones on and on about something that wasn't too funny in the first place. I concentrated more on his mimicry and timing than the actual jokes, and they were really spot-on. A comedian without those assets pulling off the same stories Eddie did would just have bored his or her audience to death, but with Eddie, the time rushed on surprisingly quickly. And he sure loves to entertain - you can tell that from the sudden ending, which almost seemed like Eddie was interrupting himself.On the downside, the flashback scene at the beginning was a little unnecessary, during the actual stand-up performance the camera was too close - we missed out on Eddie's attempts to do the Moonwalk - and I felt no particular urge to watch RAW a second time. But as a one-time experience, it was memorable. Best bits Eddie's impersonation of Bill Cosby and his idol, Richard Pryor, and the story about the wife alone in the Bahamas (Man, I loved that microphone-swinging!).Now, how about screening Delirious as well?

Though not matching the credentials of the late, brilliant insightful comic, Pryor, who I believe was even a better actor, what we have is 86 minutes guaranteed worth of raucous laughs. From infidelity to poverty, where the poor Murphy family were reduced to eating slinky springs, Murphy kicks up a storm of laughs, while remaining coolly confident, which a few budding comedian must envy. Murphy knows how to dress too, his attire more effective than his ruddy sort in Delirious. Too, the start was inventive, with Eddie's childhood, Samuel L Jackson, playing a small but fine role as the Grandfather, egging little Eddie on in the tellings of a dirty joke, seeing star potential. And to split opinions, where personally I didn't like Best Defence, I'd choose Beverly Hills Cop over 48 Hours, any day. I must admit, Murphy isn't afraid to be dramatic about the underlying realities of his jokes. it. His impersonations are fantastic, Bill Cosby, is almost nailed, plus others that impress.

Jim Carrey was funny on In Living Color and Robin Williams has a certain magic with drama films, but now they continue to submerse themselves in the lowest common form of comedy. Cheap bathroom humor and little kid comedies that are in no way funny, nor clever. Eddie Murphy is no exception now doing such things as Daddy Day Care, Imagine That (remember that?), and those countless Shrek films.But, with Eddie Murphy Raw, this was shot in 1987, when Murphy was a very vulgar and hilarious comedian. Eddie Murphy doesn't do anything like Delirious and Raw anymore, or does any sort of stand up comedy at all. These are two little pieces of his history that are now overshadowed by his lame kiddy comedies.Eddie Murphy Raw is a ninety minute comedy special of him performing at Madison Square Garden in NY's Felt Forum. The comic discusses sex, women, actors, why whites can't dance (coming from a white man, so true), why Italians are motivated by Rocky, divorce, and just the topic of life itself. He gives his realism approach to everything, and even shows sympathy for Johnny Carson losing half of his money to his wife after their divorce.The language in the film is absolutely filthy and the women dialog is incredibly misogynistic and degrading. But it's hilarious and has its own truth behind it. I'm sure Eddie cares about women, but some of the things he says about divorce is relatively, right on the money.By the end of the special, it goes a tiny bit downhill which is exceptional because most of the beginning was hilarious and very funny. Raw is the sequel to Delirious, which is one I will be sure to see in the future. Going into this with only average expectations I came out very surprised at what I just saw. I almost had to sit down and have a long talk with myself about right and wrong. It's that good.Starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Robert Townsend.

I love Murphy when he is allowed to do what he does best, and not asked to do it in an irritating manner. The man has a machine-gun for a mouth(in the sense that it can fire off absolutely lethal verbal projectiles at such a speed that counting them soon becomes an exercise in pointless behaviour) and he can behave arrogantly as well as self-deprecating(if the scales aren't necessarily equal). His impersonations are excellent, and Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor(R.I.P.), Michael Jackson(R.I.P.), Africans, Jamaicans, Italians, etc. must have been embarrassed, if they don't have(or had in those 2 cases) a sense of humor about themselves. This is a performance by Eddie, and like other stand-uppers, he ties it together and repeats certain punchlines. The whole thing keeps to an astounding pace(with very few exceptions), and flies by. This is filmed and edited with skill, evident especially in the fact that you don't notice it; it doesn't draw attention to itself, and off the man. There are stereotypes in this, and it is in general quite controversial. The main focus is on relationships, women and sex, though he does talk about gay people, us whites and our inability to dance, and there is a brief bit of bodily function jokes.

For me, this is certainly not the laughter of recognition; my upbringing could not have been more different to Eddie's. I can only imagine the comedic effect on anyone who grew up in the poor areas of sixties America.Given Murphy's race, and the predominantly black audience, it is a relief that the show is not dominated by the racial humour that tends to let down other stand-ups, who insist on pointing out the differences between white and black guys. When Murphy does tackle this subject, he dishes it out to every race and then moves on to the shared experiences of childhood.Near the end, Murphy begins an impression of his father which turns into a drawn-out sketch, reprising the similar one in Delirious. This makes the most of Murphy's acting skills with the most suitable material; a bit like The Klumps but without the child-friendly content.Nowhere else are Eddie Murphy's talents so well show-cased, but if you like this, see also; Delirious, The Golden Child, Coming to America, and Trading Places.

The essential dilemma with any humour that's cutting edge is that it relies on bucking the mainstream. All fine until the mainstream absorbs it, then it ends up being rather quaint when history comes to judge it.That's not to say that Raw isn't funny, but Murphy's overused shock tactics of profanity now seem rather desperate and antiquated. While he receives many plaudits for this stage in his career, I really don't think he has the natural comic ability of a Richard Pryor or, latterly, Chris Rock, to name just two. Now we've got the benefit of watching Raw from a vantagepoint of post-Pluto Nash, post-The Haunted Mansion, his bloated self-referentiality seems to grossly outsize his actual talent. A large chunk of his act seems to be just Murphy telling you how funny Murphy is, the narcissism a thin substitute for charm.It isn't all just swearing, of course, and the majority of his humour is observational comedy. But while he seemed outrageous and even dangerous at the time, when you really think about his targets - women, foreign races, homosexuals - are really quite reactionary. Okay, there's a veneer of satire that elevates this material, but in the main it's only the delivery and performance that separates him from a Jim Davidson. The only real difference is that Jim would have been reverential to his version of Bill Cosby.While it's true, as some IMDb commentators have said, that it runs out of steam before the end, probably the funniest bit for me was his hilarious rendition of Italian-American attitudes to the Rocky franchise. For perhaps the only time in the concert his comedy is actually about something, centring on racist attitudes against black people, even if it does parody another race to do it. For while there's a certain twelve letter word that's notorious in this movie, the most prominent word is I.

But then he gets into his personal life and the ladies who've tried to get at his money.  When this begins, its no longer funny just boring.  For the last hour we're treated to only a few more chuckles before Murphs rendition of the slinky theme to close things out.  Those who cherish Murph may enjoy his childhood stuff and other life lessons, but for me it dragged on endlessly.

He however early in his career did not only do movies but also did a couple of legendary stand-up shows, such as this one.You can tell by the crowds reaction how popular Murphy was at the time. This movie is basically one of the evenings that he performed in New York, shot on film, with only a small sketch added to the beginning of it and some very short backstage stuff. So not much else to this movie really but a very raw, filmed, stand-up show.It's not hard to see why Murphy was so good and popular for this sort of stuff. It's all about his performance and the energy that he puts into it. He rapidly bombards the audience with fun jokes and impersonations. Basically what Murphy does a lot is insulting basically every group of people but the way he does it makes it all very fun to watch. The actual stuff that he come up with wasn't even that original but like I said, it's all about the performance here. Of course some of the stuff is somewhat outdated now days, since like basically all stand-up comedians, they focus on what's hot and now at the present time. This show was from 1987, so some jokes and references might not come across as powerful or striking as they did back in those days.One thing Murphy stands out in are his impersonations. He can do some amazing stuff with his voice and can even really sound like some other well known celebrities.Being an Afro-American, Murphy of course also makes fun of the black community, like black comedians often do so well. Especially Afro-Americans themselves will probably get a blast out of it. But he basically makes fun of every group of people, like Italians and just plain men and women in general.It's a real fun and good watch and great to see an energetic Eddie Murphy in his prime and at his peak.8/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Raw Hilarity!","Date":"19 October 2009","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Documentary, Comedy","Review":" Superstar Eddie Murphy makes up some amusing as well as downright funny jokes about love, sex, marriage, alimony, and the differences between his humor and that of Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor in director Robert Townsend's 90-minute film Eddie Murphy Raw, the stand-up comic's second concert, lensed at New York City's Felt Forum. The former Saturday Night Live comedian consistently entertains audiences with his scatological, insightful, and controversial wit. Murphy looks very energetic and his humor sounds fresh and vibrant. If you love Murphy's irreverent sense of humor, you'll enjoy Raw. The biggest complaint about Raw has nothing to do with Murphy's jokes, but director Robert Townsend's lackluster staging. Of course, Murphy is the center of attention, but Townsend never allows lenser Ernst Dickerson to shoot any reaction shots of the crowd splitting their sides with laughter at Murphy's jesting.The film begins with an historic flashback to Eddie as an adolescent telling his family a funny but scatological joke before the concert part of the movie unfolds. Mind you, this opening gambit&#x97;referred to as 'the sketch'&#x97;was co-scripted by funny man Keenen Ivory Wayans, but this is not archival stuff, strictly a recreation of the event, with Samuel L. Jackson in the Murphy household as Eddie's uncle. The sketch foreshadows Murphy' specialty humor before director Townsend cuts to the real thing, with the comedian showing up. Murphy gets off to a good start with spot-on impersonations of A-Team hero Mr. T and pop singer Michael Jackson. Apparently, Mr. T has threatened to take Murphy to ground zero and Murphy regales us with his version before he impersonates Michael Jackson. If you did not know better, you would swear that Murphy is Mr. T when he does Mr. T and the same applies to his version of Michael Jackson. Murphy goes to extremes when he talks about actress Brook Shields attending a ceremony with Jackson. According to Murphy, Jackson did not take Shields to bed, something Eddie would have felt compelled to do. Before he launches into alimony sequence, Murphy chides the guys in the crowd about STDs. The comic talks about Johnny Carson's divorce and that fact that his wife walked away with half of $130-million that she&#x97;according to Murphy&#x97;had no right to since she didn't cook or clean. This tirade underscores Murphy's decision not to get married without a nuptial agreement. Mind you, as sexist as Murphy gets about dames after dudes, he explains to the women in the audience that guys are born to stray. There is a funny story about the price of fame that deals with Italians who leave the movie Rocky pumped up with their own over-inflated egos. They spark a fight in a nightclub and Eddie's bodyguards dive into and by the time everything is over, Murphy winds up getting sued by everybody. When he calls home to speak with his mom, he catches it from his drunken dad who lectures him with Motown lyrics rewritten to serve his point. Some material like Murphy's father feeding them Tonka toys isn't as hilarious. One of the funniest portions of Raw concerns a phone call from Bill Cosby who reprimands Murphy for his offensive humor and the reply that Murphy gets from Richard Pryor about Cosby's clean humor. You have to admit that Murphy takes shots at everybody and his homophobic comments probably wouldn't fly today, but the material is still hilarious. Now, Raw looks pretty dated and Murphy in 2009 is nowhere near as popular as he was when he made this routine.

I wouldn't necessarily say it's better than Delirious because the focus on both episodes are on different things. Delirious was very diverse and he kept talking about singers, actors and what not. In Raw however he's more focused on relationship and sex, while that may come of as redundant at times is not a big deal here.Nevertheless, whether he has grown a little more in Raw is obviously a natural course by nature and shouldn't be counted against his performance. Take it from me you should really be thinking about two things when deciding on which one you should watch first! The first one is what kind of subject you're interested in, actors and singers or sex and relationships? The second deals with your own personality as the vocabulary is more vulgar in Raw.Last thing to note here is that both are extremely offensive at times and sensitive people should really be thinking twice before watching either...

This 1987 special is one prominent example. One night this came on TV recently and I could not change the channel. I heard rants on celebrities, celebrity life, romantic life (consisting of pretty much a second act in a way), race, etc, and it was in classic Murphy style. I have heard a lot of romance comedy (sex, little things, different kinds of women), but in this film Murphy takes it to another level. Not only does everything seem to be absolutely real, the stories he tells work almost cinematic ally coming full circle from where they started. And a lot of the humor coming in large doses very quickly- sometimes just from facial expressions- is worth the watch even if you're just in it to get the laughs. As this is my first Eddie Murphy stand-up special (a long-time admirer of his SNL & old-school movie work) I was caught off guard perhaps- I knew his stand-up ranked with pretty high, as it was the kind of material that influenced the likes of Chris Rock. But, as with the anything of worth in stand-up, it has to be off and absurd to really hit for the big laughs, and a couple of times it really knocked in. Some of these you might find if you're digging it, but if you're just a casual fan of Murphy much of the topics he touches on will hit somewhere at you. Not to mention two specific bits (a phone call with Bill Cosby, and a bit around the perfect wife) are as close to genius as the barbershop scenes in Coming to America. If you haven't seen either special I can't say which one to start with, however whatever combustible forces raged round in the late 80's with Murphy (before he seemed to abandon stand-up for acting) are displayed through a natural, usually hysterical performance. And in the moments that aren't big with laughs at the least held my interest.

Apparently very difficult for this poorly shot film.  Ernest Dickerson who has done some good work with Spike Lee, falters under Robert Townsend's inept direction. With all those cameras going, you would think they would choose more than one shot.  Every camera seems to get a shot of Murphy from the waist up. Given the directors that Townsend had worked under up until that time (not to mention having already shot his own film), you would think he would have learned something about shot selection.  Apparently not, although his technique has improved slightly over the years.  Also, the lighting in the film is very murky. Dickerson didn't do a decent job lighting a color film until DO THE RIGHT THING.Then there is Eddie Murphy's performance.  He's mildly funny through most of the film, but in the latter third Murphy's routine disintegrates into a paranoid tirade about his fear of being financially taken advantage of by women.  When this part kicks in, you're best to go for the popcorn or the nearest exit quick.  This film is strictly for die-hard Eddie Murphy fans.

But why do people hate sequels? It's because they constantly try to compare to the original without realizing that it's a different year, different style, so therefore, a different, but not necessarily worse, performance. We're used to the original, and anything different from the original would be highly criticized.I saw Raw before I saw Delirious, and I thought it was the best stand-up comedy session I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen Richard Pryor). It was like a well-written thought-out essay where the major jokes & points are brought back multiple times throughout the entire performance such as What have you done for me lately? When I saw Delirious, after everyone told me it was better than Raw, I was disappointed to see Eddie taking pictures and talking to the crowd while he was thinking about what he was going to say next. It almost put me to sleep. Also, Delirious did not have relationship-related comedy, the backbone of the funny jokes in Raw.I was constantly trying to compare it to Raw and fell into the trap of comparing something new to something I've already seen. When I got passed the comparison, I realized that Delirious is very funny&#151;just not funnier than Raw. The problem is people have seen it before they saw Raw. If Raw came out in 1983, and Delirious came out in 1987, everybody's view of the two would be entirely different, and that is because it's our nature to compare to the original instead of realizing that they are two completely different performances.
