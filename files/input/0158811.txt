MUPPETS FROM SPACE doesn't have the level of frenetic insanity that occasionally marked the original syndicated MUPPET SHOW, and it's neither as edgy as, say, the latest Mike Meyers movie nor as fast-paced as an Indiana Jones yarn.But even if it's a little on the laid-back side, its heart is very much in the right place.  In some ways, this is a direct spiritual sequel to the original MUPPET MOVIE, focusing this time on Gonzo's origin story rather than Kermit's.  Where the first film spoofed the road comedies and Westerns, this one spoofs CE3K and MiB (but not, as the title might suggest, the Star Trek or Star Wars franchises).It's lighter on the zingy one-liners than MUPPET MOVIE, and longtime Muppet fans will probably be a bit frustrated at the soundtrack, which relies almost entirely on borrowed and guested songs rather than musical performances by the Muppets themselves.  (Note if you peeked at the soundtrack album listings first, be advised that I'm Going to Go Back There Someday is NOT in the film.  Should be, darnit, but isn't.)  But there's some inspired silliness involving lab rats and a wonderfully zany infiltration of a Secret Government Installation.All in all, what's here is a very warm and watchable comedy of a kind that's increasingly hard to find in theaters these days.  And Miss Piggy's karate is still as dangerous as ever. I'm looking forward to the next Muppet film already.  (How about a spy spoof, guys?  My name is Frog, Kermit the Frog.)

A tiny bit too secular-liberal in parts but overall, not offensive and definitely entertaining.

I agree with the other comments that this film is nothing like you expect a Muppets movie to be. Many more adult references than any other Muppet movie and a lot of scary stuff that I would not take a child to see. There are a lot more things that a child could misinterpret (including the very beginning of the movie which shows Noah of the Bible as a cruel man who leaves Gonzo to die because he's different. Although it's a dream sequence that Gonzo may have misinterpreted, a child would not make that distinction but would rather associate Noah and the Bible with cruelty to a beloved friend.Even the soundtrack (Brick House, etc.) are not songs that seem appropriate for the age group for most Muppet audiences (or the children parents would bring).The film may bring some chuckles to some adults, but I would never bring a child to see it.All in all it is a very sad reminder that the original genius and charm of the Muppets is gone.

Unfortunately, the original story part of my praise wasn't a great story and was really over-bloated with mostly failed attempts to give everyone, and I mean every Muppet, their 15 minutes. It's only 87 minutes and that's a lot of Muppet ground to cover. That said, the film did the best it could do. You're just best off knowing the decades-old characters beforehand.The other pleasantry was Pepe. He quickly became one of my favorites of all time, and he was brand new. This shrimp, sorry, King Prawn, okaaaay, stole every scene and rightfully so. He was deliciously &#x96; no pun &#x96; funny and had immediate taglines, such as ending practically every sentence with okaaaay. The rest of the usual suspects were funny, but seemed like they kept falling over each other in both setting &#x96; a hundred or so live in the same house &#x96; and story. The other newcomer, Bobo the Bear, didn't live in the house and thank goodness for him. He was hilarious and a refreshing new character that didn't get bogged down like the rest of the cast.Gonzo's getting messages from outer space and barely anyone is free from their enormously busy schedules to believe him. Who knew being a Muppet was so time consuming? Not that they would've believed him anyways; his cereal is one such portal.The messages are from his own kind, his species that he's been searching for his whole life, not to mention a feeling of not being one of a kind anymore. Like most space movies, the government gets involved, this time with comedic overtones &#x96; it's the Muppets, after all.The gang goes on the mission of saving Gonzo, from what they think is himself and/or the big-bad government and instead gets caught up with helping him find true family and awareness.That's the text-book synopsis. The truth and root of the story does involve family and belonging but what adults like me go for is the humor and warmth we get from watching, once again, our beloved Muppets from our childhood. You won't be let down on the humor, the slapstick humor and Miss Piggy's karate chop.It's recommended for fans, but not necessarily for Muppet virgins. You should begin with the first three, skipping the Christmas Carol and Treasure Island &#x96; two you can watch later, no rush &#x96; and then watch this.

The film has a really cute prologue with Noah and Gonzo...but after that, it's a rather inconsequential film about Gonzo being sought by some stupid (and very clich√©d) government agency that thinks he's an alien. It's rather poorly written--with very few jokes and very little heart. Additionally, many of the familiar Muppets are absent and in their place are some very unappealing and poorly designed puppets (a few of which look really creepy). All in all, a film ONLY for die-hard Muppet fans--others would best see one of the GOOD Muppet films, such as The Muppet Movie, The Muppets or The Muppet Christmas Carol.

In fact the only Muppet movie I don't really like is Muppets Wizard of Oz. Muppets From Space, while not as good as the older Muppet movies, is certainly enjoyable. One thing I didn't particularly like though was the soundtrack, a bit too 1970s style, and because of this, I was never too sure what time period the film was supposed to be. The plot of the film is very original, though you would assume the Muppets went to space without having read the plot line, and the jokes are funny, if less inspired than something from the Muppet Movie. It isn't quite true to the style of the older Muppet movies, but the film does try to and almost succeeds. The story focuses on Gonzo, and his story was very heartwarming. Any scene with Miss Piggy who I love is priceless, and Jeffrey Tambor makes the most of his role as Ed, the paranoid operative. I also liked the contributions from F.Murray Abraham, Andie McDowell, The Sweedish Chef and The Bear Sidekick.Nice also to see Kermit, Rizzo and Fozzie, not to mention Sam the Eagle, in short all your favourite Muppets, though the best scene is the beginning, not to mention the sandwich scene.

The shrimp is kind of annoying, but he gets some good lines every once in awhile. All the classic Muppets are used to great effect, as usual.Although some of the magic was lost after Jim Henson died, I prefer this film over his last theatrical Muppet feature, Muppets Take Manhattan. Muppets From Space is the only post-Henson project they've done as yet that recaptures the zany magic of the early films and the TV show. A must-see for the Muppet-curious of all ages.

I saw episodes of the original Muppet Show when I was little, and later saw The Muppet Movie and The Great Muppet Caper (didn't see The Muppets Take Manhattan until last year), as well as some post-Jim Henson material; The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island, and the remake of The Muppet Show, Muppets Tonight. None of these disappointed me. By the time Muppets from Space came out, I was seeing the first signs of adolescence, and didn't end up seeing the movie that year, though I do recall seeing the trailer for it on TV. Nine years later, having finally seen this movie, I am not impressed! Lately, Gonzo has been feeling lonely in the world, being a whatever, not knowing where he came from, and has been having nightmares about it. One morning, however, he sees messages in his breakfast cereal, ones which appear to be from aliens from another planet! While Gonzo is on the rooftop, watching the sky (following one of the messages), he is struck by lightning! He then meets two cosmic fish, and learns from them that he is an extraterrestrial! The other Muppets think he has gone crazy when he tells them about this, but he still attempts to contact his relatives. Meanwhile, government agent K. Edgar Singer is searching for extraterrestrial life on Earth, and has detected the messages Gonzo has been seeing! After Gonzo appears on TV, Singer manages to lure him, along with Rizzo, into captivity, and the other Muppets must try and rescue them and see if Gonzo can finally meet his family! I knew Muppets from Space wasn't the most popular Muppet movie, and it didn't surprise me when I found that one problem with this movie is that while I did smile/snicker sometimes, it's not usually that funny. In fact, it's sometimes quite lame, such as the female armed guard played by Kathy Griffin in love with Animal. However, that's not its only problem. Another major problem is that it's a tad too dark for the Muppets! It's often too cruel, especially when Gonzo and Rizzo are in captivity, with the conditions they face there. That building is a rather dreary place, not the kind one would probably want to see the Muppets in. Those scenes, as well as a number of others, including a hoof to the groin, make me wonder why this movie is rated G! Also, the story is a bit bland, and there are no memorable songs. Basically, the magic that made previous Muppet material so good seems so far away in this flick! I was disappointed by this movie, even with low expectations. There are those who think everything that has been done with the Muppets since Jim Henson's premature death in 1990 is lame, and I'm definitely going to have to disagree with them. However, I'm going to have to agree with those who think this particular movie defiles the Muppets, and I've never been able to describe anything else I've seen featuring the Muppets that way before! When I see the Muppets, I expect good, lighthearted family entertainment, with plenty for kids and adults alike. It seems that some people describe this movie that way, but I honestly don't get it, and sincerely doubt I ever will! That's certainly not what I got with Muppets from Space! What happened?! Yes, this movie is rated G, which one would probably expect from a Muppet movie, but unlike the previous ones, I really don't think it should be! The point I'm trying to make with this review is that this is NOT the Muppets!

Murray Abraham, David Arquette, Andie MacDowell, Rob Schneider Perhaps the worst of the Muppet films and a definite disgrace to the Jim Henson name. Story opens with a dream where Gonzo is rejected from Noah's ark. He sets out to find out who or what he is. His breakfast cereal indicates that he is from outer space. Too bad it didn't inform him that he was involved in a stupid family film. Jeffrey Tambor plays the villain and he has radar sightings of alien activity and he looks to kidnap Gonzo for tests. While Gonzo and Rizzo the rat chew as much scenery as possible, other Muppets are given little to do. Miss Piggy is featured as a talk show host, and Kermit the frog is given nothing to work with. Horribly directed by Timothy Hill who just doesn't seem to be with the spirit of the Muppets. Tambor is amusing in an otherwise thankless role of a cardboard villain. Other live actors overact to the extremes including F. Murray Abraham, David Arquette, Rob Schneider, and Andie MacDowell. All have done better work in much better films but here they are easily upstaged by the puppets. Sure, the Muppets are the film but the celebrity appearances should count for something other than what they are reduced to here. The whole idea surrounding Gonzo's existence had potential but unfortunately it is reduced to idiocy. Score 2 / 10 "},{"Title":"I Like the Music in This Movie!","Date":"7 June 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":" Muppets From Space was one of the first movies I ever saw in theaters. When my family and I saw it, I fell in love with it. Again, it's the Muppets, and I was a kid. Now that I view it as an adult, I must say it's one of their weaker movies. Now it's not bad, let me say that - believe me, there are many worse things the Muppets can do! There are actually a lot of things I like about this movie; but for what it is, I can only see why a lot of people don't like it, but I have to agree with them as well.So what's bad about this movie? Well, there are a few things. First of all, this movie fails in the same way Muppets Tonight fails it doesn't have the usual Muppet brand of entertainment. It doesn't have that Jim Henson spirit or that Muppet spirit that you see in other Muppet productions. In that sense, this doesn't seem like a Muppet movie; it seems like the Muppets are trying to do another type of movie. I have no problem with them telling a different type of story, but they're not telling it how they would normally tell stories, in that Muppet-like style. Secondly, I think this story is a bit immature. It sets up a really good plot and conflict Gonzo wants to know who he is. There are so many cool, mature things you could do with this? What's the end result? He's an alien. They could have allowed so many mature, nice moments here. Instead, there's a costume made of foil, an evil man working for the government agency, and an epic spaceship landing that leads to a not-as-epic group of aliens.Also, big shock, I don't like a lot of these characters that fill the screen. I'm glad that we actually see more of our favorite, classic characters here, but we still see some of those other characters. Johnny and Sal? Dr. Van Neuter? Pepe? PEPE?!?! I am blown away that he became a main character for the Muppets!! He's annoying!! OK, he's not THAT annoying in this movie (he gets much annoying later - just wait), but why did he get so much love and attention? What about Clifford?! In my mind, Clifford should have received that fame and popularity! I say that mainly because Clifford is actually an older character; he existed while Jim Henson was alive - that annoying shrimp came later. Bump him out of here!...But I digress.Finally, I think the movie is kind of sloppy. I don't think the producers put enough thought into how they could make this movie work. It goes back to the creativity and genius and feeling the earlier Muppet projects had. They were simple, they had thoughts behind everything that took place, and they flowed very well. Here, it's kind of complex, we feel as if there weren't any reasons certain moments took place, and there's a lack of flow here.This is neither good or bad, but rather something I noticed. Am I the only who's confused how the Muppets live? In Muppet Babies, they lived in the nursery; in The Muppets Take Manhattan, they go to college together; in The Muppet Movie they met each other for the first time; in The Great Muppet Caper, they met in England; and here, they all live in the same house together. I always wondered this after I saw this movie as a kid. I've gotten over it sense, but I couldn't have been the only one confused by this.OK, so what's good about the movie? Well, some of these jokes work. When they're funny, they're really funny. When I'm not looking at the characters I don't like, I get to see the ones I do enjoy, like Kermit, Piggy, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rizzo, Robin, Statler and Waldorf, Clifford, Bunsen and Beaker, and cameos by Scooter, Rowlf, Swedish Chef, and the Electric Mayhem...though, am I the only one who thinks it's weird that Animal has a lot of scenes away from the band? Why isn't he with them? When did his popularity grow that much? I like the music in this movie! It's movie that my parents grew up on, and it's really cool, groovy music! Though, I must admit that's a personal preference. There's another review of this movie on this website that confirmed what I thought, that some people aren't too fond of the music of this movie. And while I do like the music, I have to say it's weird the Muppets hardly sing here and that there aren't any original songs here. But, even so, I still love these songs and the music.The movie is entertaining to watch every now and then, but it doesn't offer any of the charm or likability that any of the earlier productions have. I know a number of people who really love this movie, and maybe you will too. Again, this isn't that bad, and there are worse things they've produced (trust me, we'll get to those later!). But I would be lying if I said this is up there with The Muppet Show, The Muppet Movie, or The Great Muppet Caper. I'd still suggest this movie, but don't expect to see these characters in their traditional form. BOOYIKA!

I grew up on the antics of these guys not quite getting all of their humor but laughing nonetheless.  Within the past year I have experienced sort of a Muppet resurgence; I bought several old tapes off of ebay, viewed the original three Muppet movies, and ordered the Muppet Show set.  I finally realized the full extent of Muppet humor, that it is not quite for kids, but not quite for adults either.At first, this movie disappointed me.  I won't include spoilers but I missed my old favorite Muppet, Rowlf the Dog.  I know he was a Henson-voiced character, but I don't understand why no one was drafted to replace him. Rowlf actually predates Kermit the Frog, as he was used by Henson and Frank Oz in commercials before everyone's favorite frog came about.  The Electric Mayhem were gone as well, and we barely saw the Swedish Chef.  Anywho, enough about that.There are no original Muppet songs in this film.  They are all recycled 70's tunes.  I am of two minds about this, because I loved the songs from the first three Muppet Movies, but loathed Muppet Treasure Island and Muppet Christmas Carol.  After multiple viewings I decided that I liked the 70's music after all.  I especially liked the songs used in the cannonball scene and the cosmic fish scene.Kermit wasn't given enough screen time. I know this was a picture about Gonzo, but I missed the inclusion of Kermit as the Muppet's unofficial leader.  He just seems to be confused for the duration of the movie. Luckily, the Kermit/Piggy romance isn't rehashed.  On the original Muppet Show, Kermit avoided Piggy by any means necessary; I'm not sure why they are a romantic item in most of the films.  I find Piggy to be very, very annoying, despite my love of most things Muppet.  Have her eyes moved closer together or what?The obligatory celebrity cameos were pretty good.  I hated the inclusion of Hulk Hogan.  The Kathy Griffin/Animal moment disturbed me.  Ray Liotta was likeable.  Rob Schneider was just too frantic.  BTW, is the Dr. VanNeuter Muppet supposed to be Andy Dick?  They look very alike to me.Anywho, this is a funny film, just not as funny as the first three.  If you want to see the Muppets at their best, rent The Muppet Movie or go to the Disney MGM Studios and see Muppet Vision 3D.  If you are simply interested in having fun, rent this one.  Try to get the DVD, since it has some nifty special features like commentary and bloopers.

Whether it be through early appearances on Ed Sullivan, growing up with Sesame Street, or even those stupid Muppet Babies, we all have a fond connection with Jim Henson.I love the Muppets, and for the most part, I think the movies are great.  Their corny humor and their catchy songs are fun for children and adults.  I was particularly impressed with the fact that their last two films were based on classic novels.  Their adaptations were not necessarily faithful, yet they were better than some of the Hollywood versions I have seen.  I was hopeful that this would become a continuing theme.  For that reason I was disappointed when I saw the trailer for Muppets in Space (?).In this film, Gonzo has a yearning for one of his own kind, (whatever that is).  Somewhere near the beginning he finds out that he comes from outer space and that his species is coming back to meet with him.  Kermit thinks poor Gonzo is cracked.  Miss Piggy is conveniantly hosting a talk show about UFO's and suddenly jumps on the bandwagon.  As you can imagine, hijinks ensue.  The Muppets must rescue Gonzo when he is kidnapped by some evil government types.  Miss Piggy gets into yet another karate match, this time with an expert in black belt.  All the Muppet stuff we have come to know and love is there.  I was most entertained by Rizzo the Rat.  The more I see of him the more I learn to like him.  This time he is imprisoned in a test lab where they test -- uh oh -- RATS!  The scene is probably the funniest bit in the film.  I was confused by the soundtrack.  It was an eclectic mix of old R&B tunes which seemed somewhat 'adult' for a Muppet movie, but none the less, I went with it.  All in all this is not one of the better Muppet Movies.  It lacks the heart of the original, and it lacks the depth of the last two.  I saw this one on video and I'm glad of that.  In fact I think this might have served better as a straight to video flick.  I would have been more disappointed if I spent $8.

To see the Muppets playing themselves, as they did in the first 3 movies before Jim Henson passed away, instead of some adaptation of a classic story, excited me. Unfortunately, when Jim Henson died, the heart of the Muppets went with him. While he tried to draw more adults to The Muppet Show, even going so far as titling the pilot Sex and Violence, this one caters a bit more to the younger bunch, with some awfully misused '70s music and an ex-Nickelodeon director. Why Jerry Juhl and co. were apparently afraid that the movie wouldn't attract enough kids is a mystery to me, but here we have an opening scene set to Brick House. Unfortunately, the bottom line is that this movie is just not that funny. Bordering on brilliance at times with a hilarious scene borrowed from Independence Day and a cameo by Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson (I wish Dawson was here), the rest of the movie just chugs along with too many unfunny jokes. Yes, Steve Whitmire finally has Kermit down to an art, and all the Muppeteers do fantastic jobs, and Jeffrey Tambor does a great job with the material, but once again I stress, NOT FUNNY. So sorry.

Amidst a sea of raunchy comedies like South Park, Austin Powers 2 and screamfests like The Blair Witch Project, the muppets have remained untouched. It is refreshing to see that some things never change, as Robin reminded us in a Muppet Family Christmas. This latest installment of the muppet adventures is an almost simplistic journey of a hero. Gonzo must overcome obstacles, such as mowing the lawn, building a jacuzzi (he he), escaping from a secret government hideaway, in order to reach his final goal meeting his family. Everyone can relate to Gonzo's feelings of loneliness and isolation, and his final realization that Kermit, Piggy and the rest of the gang ARE his family. Schmaltzy perhaps, but it is what the Muppets do best. Several clever touches in the film included the references to Men in Black, Independence Day, and Star Wars, with the Cosmic Fish. I also enjoyed Gonzo in the wind tunnel calling for Auntie Em. And who could forget the Ambassador to Gonzo's people, who was given his dream while the theme to Star Trek played in the background? This is truly classic Muppets fare. Do not watch it as an adult, but let your mind become childlike again, and you will love it.

Somehow, the folks at Henson films have managed to simultaneously create a film that young children will love (action, adventure and universal themes of belonging), and that adults will also enjoy. Muppets in Space is a return to the classic Muppet movies in that it is brimming with references that will sail over kids' heads but will keep parents and adult viewers in stitches. Indeed, many of the adults at the screening I attended had to stifle their laughter in order to avoid missing the next lines.It is the audience's ability to identify with the film's central characters and their plight  that will determine a film's ultimate success or failure. One of the secret weapons of all of the Muppet films (and the television show), has always been the likeability of the Muppets themselves.  Muppet films are never better than when they rely on  Muppets and not people or special effects to carry the story. In this case, that is precisely what they do.  It is impossible not to relate to Gonzo's desire to find out about his past  you can see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice. This is generally true of all of the film's central Muppet characters.  It never ceases to amaze me that Muppets frequently convey more feeling than many live movie stars.The core of the film revolves around Gonzo's search for his family but relies on such universal themes as friendship and loyalty.  And, while Gonzo may lack the star power of Kermit or Ms. Piggy,  the Henson folks do manage to bring out the pathos that is inherent in this timid lonely character. Children will undoubtedly relate to Gonzo's feelings of isolation and his longing to feel a part of something bigger than himself (as will many adults).  It is a testament to the screenwriters and the cast that the film can focus on these issues while not becoming maudlin or cloying.The film is populated by virtually all of the Muppet regulars.   Gonzo is, of course, the star of this film having earned his stripes in his break through role as Charles Dickens in The Muppet Christmas Carol.  He is accompanied by the redoubtable Rizzo the Rat whose dry wit sparked much of the humor in  The Muppet Christmas Carol.   Miss Piggy  makes a glamorous appearance, albeit in a small part as a corporate climbing news caster who starts out as a coffee pig.  Once again,  it is Kermit the Frog who provides the film's emotional anchor.  Yes, there are a few Kermit moments when the tender green wonder points out what is really important in life, such as family and friends and listening to what other people are really saying. The film also incorporates numerous guest shots by famous and not so famous actors.  Dawson's Creek fans won't want to miss a cameo appearance by two of the show's regulars,  not to mention a reference to Dawson and his infamous science fiction plots.All of this is reason enough to go see the film, but when coupled with some fiendishly clever references to such classic science fiction institutions as Star Trek and such notable films as ID4,  Close Encounters, and the ubiquitous Star Wars,  it  all makes Muppets in Space more than worth the price of admission.  If only they had  incorporated Pigs In Space  - but you can't have everything.

The idea to explore the origins of Gonzo was nice (indeed inevitable, ditto the excursion into sci-fi) &#150; even if the limelight is ultimately stolen by Rizzo The Rat (as ever, Gonzo's closest pal) and Pepe The Prawn (whose tendency to end his dialogue with Okay? recalls the teacher from SOUTH PARK, then at its peak). The emphasis on 'new' characters pretty much undermines the contribution of established Muppets like Kermit The Frog and Fozzie Bear&#133;and, while Miss Piggy herself gets a fairly sizeable role, she basically retreads her paces from THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER (1981). The script (and look of the film) clearly draws on recent genre blockbusters like INDEPENDENCE DAY and MARS ATTACKS! (both 1996); that said, its funnier moments typically involve throwaway bits of business, such as the resident pop group (which has Animal for a drummer) dressing up for the occasion when they replace Gonzo at a Bar Mitzvah and Pepe subconsciously convincing Gonzo to build a Jacuzzi in the spirit of FIELD OF DREAMS (1989)! Also notable, though, are the interrogation scenes with Gonzo at the secret military/scientific base and Rizzo's simultaneous tenure there as a guinea pig. Unsurprisingly, the climax sees the arrival of a mother ship on Earth &#150; with a human eventually filling in for Gonzo, since the latter cannot bring himself to be separated from the other Muppets after all.

He becomes obsessed with messages that point him toward aliens who are leaving cryptic clues as to their existence. NAturally,most of the public--including a majority of his friends--believe he is wacko,and his mission becomes even lonelier.HOwever,there are a few people who believe him,one of them being a lightly regarded government chief(Jeffrey TAmbor,who is great in just about anything!),who believes that,when he comes upon Gonzo,that he can lead him and the government to first contact with extraterrestrial life.Cut,non-threatening and lightning quick of a film,director Tim Hill employs nearly all of the usual characters from previous Muppet incarnations,and Frank Oz returns as a voice of such characters as Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear(along with the capable help of other Muppet vets DAve Goelz and Jerry Nelson and relative newcomers Steve Whitmire and Bill Bareta) to give heft to the full-bodied puppets. A rollicking,70s R&B soundtrack fueled by(Among others)George Clinton,added to a slough of cameos(KAtie Holmes,Hulk Hogan,Andie MacDowell,Robert Downey Jr.,David Arquette among them),and you have a typical Muppet movie only a little better than recent efforts.

The plot is wonderfully written, and acted well by the human actors and lovingly portrayed by the muppeteers. However, the Muppets have lost their edge; the crisp delivery of the zany but witty one-liners is gone. Forever? Gods, I hope not.

I don't think they were even seen together here! Instead Rizzo is Gonzo's main companion, and while he's very funny, I miss Camilla...Also missed is the Kermit/Piggy romance. And while as mentioned this is pretty much Gonzo's movie, we just didn't see enough Kermit, and there were no moments between him and Piggy which dominated the first three movies and were wonderful. But the Muppets I've really been missing for a long time are The Electric Mayhem. Only Animal's been sticking around. They're still there in the background, but I miss Janice's sharp and hilarious remarks, and Dr. Teeth's general wacky disposition. I hope they realize how much they're missed and really bring them back someday.But Bunsen and Beaker were fantastic! Even though they were secondary characters (as almost always), they had some of the funniest parts of the movie. Beaker's too adorable.Anyhow, it turns out that Gonzo's an alien, which isn't surprising, but it was funny when he was just regarded as a whatever. Part of Gonzo's charm was that you had no idea what he was or where he came from. But I loved the beginning scene in the Muppet house to Brick House, and there were many other great parts. I was at first let down when there were no original songs, but I think the great '70s music really suits the feel of this movie.Granted, 'Muppets From Space' doesn't compare to the original Muppet movies, but it's still very good.

Murray Abraham, Rob Schneider, Ray Liotta, David Arquette, Kathy Griffin, Andie MacDowell, and Hulk Hogan Director Tim Hill   88 minutes    Rated GBy Blake FrenchThe quality of Muppets From Space doesn't compare to the quality of muppet movies that I watched while growing up. Those films I still enjoy today. The series of children's stories that this sega is coming to is gradually lowering their standards. It used to be that every film was a different adventure into a different atmosphere. Those were full of creativity and imagination. What were they thinking when making Muppets From Space? Maybe the filmmakers are running out of ideas? Or perhaps they think that it is time to start looking into the Muppet family history? Whatever it was, this film is a disappointment in the highest.The film, of course, contains all those lovable Muppets including Kermit the Frog, Rizzo the Rat, Gonzo, Waldorf, Dr. Bunsen, Beaker, Sam the Eagle, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal and many more. What little story there is centers on not an upcoming event or an imaginative adventure, but a single muppet; Gonzo. Where did he come from? Are there any more of his kind? What species is he? Why are there no others in his family history? What is his family history? Those are the questions he keeps asking himself throughout the film, ones that just don't hold the audience's interest.The movie's plot ends up being about a rescue mission for the muppets who must save Gonzo from a top secret government facility where a madman named Edgar plans to suck out Gonzo's brains. The rescue scenes are some of the film's funniest. Most of the hilarious moments have to do with Miss Piggy and her toughness. One of them has a protective gadget that looks like a spray bottle with a mist inside that makes the victim do what ever the sprayer commands. A perfect Ray Liotta as a security guard is the first casualty, who turns from screaming at the muppets to leave the plant's property to a welcoming invitation who smiles and waves to the muppets as they enter the facility. Another has Andie MacDowell as a news reporter handing Miss Piggy her job and offering a cup of coffee, when before the spray Piggy was on the verge of being laid off.There are surprisingly some very big names in this minor production. Among them is an evil looking Jeffrey Tambor, a joyfully cruel David Arquette, a hyper Rob Schneider, and finishing off the list are brief cameos by  Hulk Hogan, F. Murray Abraham and Kathy Griffin.The problem with the movie is the uncertainty between the funny moments and adventurous happenings. The filmmakers do not take advantage of having the muppets as the stars. There are no cute romantic comments between Kermit and Piggy. The traditional characteristics of the muppets are missing. I left the theater feeling cheated, not encouraged. And while I realize the film's target audience is between ages' 4-6, I get the sense that even they will be more pleased if their parents stick with older muppet movies for them to watch. Try The Muppet Christmas Carol, or if I am a little off season, how about the much more appetizing Muppet Treasure Island.

When Gonzo discovers that he's an alien from outer space, he gets abducted by government agents and it's up to Kermit and the rest of the Muppet gang to rescue him.  Kids under six are likely to enjoy this outing, but they deserve better than this.  My evaluation *1/2 out of ****. "},{"Title":"Not what it could have been","Date":"18 July 1999","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  I enjoyed this movie somewhat, but thought it could have been much better. The Muppets themselves, one of the longest-enduring comedy ensembles in TV and film history, retain their appeal to both kids and grownups, mixing deliberately bad jokes with touches of the absurd (take a look at the bathroom in the Muppets house toward the beginning) and exquisitely timed set pieces such as the poker game with Rizzo the Rat and Pepe the Prawn. Most of my favorite parts of the movie were bits of Muppet business that had nothing to do with the plot, and the filmmakers might have done better to keep going in this vein with a day in the life of the Muppets movie.  I bet it would have been fabulous.However, someone had a brilliant idea for a plot, centered on the question, Just what kind of creature IS Gonzo, anyway?  Muppets from Space starts off promisingly with this question, evoking a certain amount of pathos in the process.  Then Gonzo begins getting messages that he believes to be from his kinfolk, and from outer space!From there the plot takes over, and though Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal, Rizzo, Pepe, and Bobo the Bear (as an oddball receptionist at the E.T.-watching bureau who serve as the bad guys) get some good bits of business, they're swallowed up in the necessity of moving the plot along. Worse, the action moves so quickly (presumably to keep the movie length down within the average little kid's attention span) that any depth the story might have is utterly lost.  Sure, it's a kids movie, and maybe kids are more tolerant of shallow but fast plots.  The best kids movies, however, aren't just functional, they're magical.  A few extra minutes, maybe as few as 5 or 10 if done right, could have added some much-needed magic to this movie.The human roles are stripped down past the point of iconicity to the cardboard level.  The most effective have little screen time; a man in black who goes mano a mano with Miss Piggy, a female guard who falls for Animal's, uh, animalistic ways, and a scientist who sounds like he'd rather be a prison guard and treats his lab rats accordingly.  The humans with more screen time, such as the main villain (the head of the E.T.-watching bureau), don't come off as well.  When the humans are less believable than the Muppets, something's wrong.(Of course the filmmakers might have stripped down the human roles on purpose, precisely to make the Muppets more believable as characters.  If so, I think they were mistaken.  They should have aimed for parity of believability, as with Bob Hoskins and the toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or the best episodes of the original Muppet Show.)Finally, though the music (a selection of '70s funk oldies) was very good, there was too much of it; the fimmakers should have kept the space-related items (Shining Star, Outa-Space, and Flash Light rewritten as Space Flight) and the set-piece toward the end where all the funk pays off, and jettisoned the rest.Next time, I hope the people behind the Muppets either pay more serious attention to their plot, or else keep the plot as far out of the way as possible.

It deals in themes of identity and loneliness with more beautied and wrenching sincerity than I've ever seen in any other piece. The fact they are muppets make it all the more touching, because the muppets are so charmingly real. It's about Gonzo coming to terms with his place in the world, and Gonzo was always my favorite character and the one I identified with most, especially, this film just got me. Maybe it isn't the single greatest puppet film, but it is the most dramatic and emotional. Times, it was almost too much and watching the film was such a devastatingly sad experience. In fact, at times it almost seems like there is too much overarching poignancy and emotional core but it's probably just that it's so well-done that it's strikes chords so large. This isdefinitely different in tone than the other ones, but it's a fine andpowerful experience and a superb entry in Muppet Movie-dom.

Finally, by the late-1990s, the Muppets are losing their mass audience appeal and becoming much more annoying than entertaining. Cameos and would-be comical situations do nothing to help out a film that seems lost in a black hole of irritation. Very few youngsters will care about Muppets From Space and many fewer adults will be able to make it through this snoozer. Turkey (0 stars out of 5).

This film is filled with insult humor, gratuitous violent behavior and scary images, most of which are inappropriate for children to see, and all of which are completely out of character for The Muppets.As an example, in the very first moments of the film, Gonzo is trapped in the storm that will flood the earth. Noah doesn't permit him to enter the ark because he doesn't know what he is! It's a horrible message to send at the very start, and the film only goes downhill from that point. It's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's not meaningful and it's not Muppet.If nothing else, Muppets From Space proves what a visionary Jim Henson was, and that, unfortunately, no one in his organization grasped his philosophy, even slightly. Now you know why the Muppets have languished since Jim left.

I just slept&#x85;Maybe I was too tired, but the commentary helped me a lot it is terribly boring as the Muppet tried to be silly and funny but just failed! It's the same for the bloopers bonus a rather good idea but it lacks terribly of imagination! 20 scenes of about 4 seconds without a global play it's just stupid! Even if the animation is good, and all the Muppet being there, the Muppet magic is gone as it doesn't make me laugh! In addition, the movie is rather dark (in a military base or at night) and the colors aren't very bright! Finally, for what I saw, Andie stars for maybe two minutes getting involved in a cat-fight with Peggy! That's all! Maybe she has got more screening time but it was during my sleep!

More follows and Gonzo becomes convinced that he is from space. Unfortunately nobody believes him, well nobody but COVNET, a secret government agency that has seen the messages too. Now they are willing to do everything to learn what they believe Gonzo knows...Comments Well you get what you expect, and that's good. A typical Muppet movie centered about Gonzo, with the typical Muppet kind of humor and jokes. But also, there are many more or less hidden references too other movie clearly aimed for a little older audience, that they will enjoy. I did. Combined with the appearances of known actors and celebrities in small or bigger roles it makes a very fun movie.Not to be taken seriously, but who would want to do that.

Gonzo (Dave Goelz) is not his usual self (obsessed by injury) because he does not know where he came from or who he is. He is then told by messages to watch the sky. He is told by cosmic fish that he is an alien. He is now trying everything he can to see or contact his family. Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) and the other Muppets obviously do not believe him. Meanwhile, K. Edgar Singer (Jeffrey Tambor) is trying to meet Gonzo, and possibly find out his possible alien past and genetics.

Instead, it should have been called Gonzo is From Space.  After all, the people who have really made the Muppet franchise successful after all these years are rarely seen throughout the movie.  Instead we see new characters like that French lobster replace old lovables such as Fozzie bear and Kermit the frog.The charm and story of the usual muppets movies are lost in the endless sea of pointless celebrity cameos and lame jokes. Forget about this movie if you are a loyal Muppets fan and instead rent A Muppets Christmas Carrol.  At least with that movie you get some imagination and not a series of pointless jokes that have already been done on cable countless of times.

First off, I cannot believe this film was rated G. PG or PG-13 would have been more appropriate. Why my 2,4,6 and 8 year olds had to see shotguns, machine guns, torture and kidnapping, let alone the fighting is beyond me. This is not what you'd expect in a rated G muppet film. Obviously Jim Henson was not alive when this film was done. I was so upset by this film, I was going to walk out several times, but wanted my kids to see the resolution or the happy parts, so they wouldn't just remember the violence. It was so anti-climatic, with the resolution lasting only a few minutes before the end of the film, it was worthless. My kids were shaking and telling me how frightened they were. ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL!!! "}]
