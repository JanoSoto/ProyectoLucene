And who else could have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano playing/dubbing an actor could deliver?In the novel as in the film, there are two big antagonists to the heroine Kohut her own mother (wonderful, wreck-voiced Annie Girardot, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau) and Austria itself. The mother personifies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that deceptively and perversely encourages racist/fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional repression, and, let's say, Ã¼bermensch ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdown.La Pianiste also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue how dangerous it is to reveal your innermost fantasies to the one (you think) you love. We tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves, which may turn out to be a huge, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. Here, Kohut learns (?) the lesson in the most painful and humiliating of ways.It must be mentioned that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the best-known and praised authors in Austria and Europe (well, now she's got a Nobel Prize!) and that autobiographical passages can be inferred in her novel, as she herself was a pianist and had a reportedly difficult relationship with her mother. The novel also includes long passages about Kohut's childhood and adolescence so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now. Haneke chose to hide this information in the film, forcing us to wonder how she got to be that way (don't we all know a Erika Kohut out there?). But he very much preserves the fabric of the book in his film unbearable honesty, to the point where most secretive, horrendous feelings painfully emerge -- envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hate, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion etc. All of them unmistakably human.I thought La Pianiste was a deeply moving film, very disturbing and thought-provoking, with a handful of unforgettable scenes, and that's just all I ask of movies. It also made me buy and be thrilled by the book, discover a fantastic author I hadn't read before, and listen again and again to Schubert - so, my thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle!!! On the other hand, if you're looking for light entertainment, please stay away.

This comment is bound to provoke some controversy by disagreeing with those who have easily classified this film as an indictment of sexual repression and self-denial. Michael Haneke (as a film-maker) and brilliant Isabelle Huppert (as the music professor Erika Kohut) place sexual relationships within a larger frame of reference -- that of the boundaries of one's own SELF.Erika is a highly intelligent, perfectionistic, ambitious and driven woman, who has single-mindedly and relentlessly identified her whole self with her work and achievement. In a sense, she is madly competitive and is painfully sensitive to any kind of attempt to sideline her or, even more importantly, to take her and her opinions for granted. She is no puppet in anyone's theatre. She is unpredictable and that's one of her major instruments of self-assertion. She is overly harsh on everybody surrounding her -- you need a pair of plyers to pull the most modest words of praise from her tight mouth. Observe Erika's body language in the film accentuated pride, not an insignificant dose of aplomb and even snobbishness, cold sternness, and extremely caustic sense of humor.But look more carefully Erika is most harsh towards herself. Unimaginably and cruelly harsh on herself! Erika's fear of sex is not just a function of her mother's repression and other hackneyed reasons examined in thousands of other movies. Erika is first and foremost obsessed with what entering into any kind of a relationship, be it casual sexual intercourse or an enduring love affair, means to her sense of personal independence. She is prepared to forego relationships and suffer as a consequence, rather than to succumb and be forever unsure of whether she had given in or emerged on top. She experiences all human relationships, and sexual ones above all else, as a field of power play, of asymmetrical exchange of influences. And there is one thing she apparently cannot withstand at all -- and that's a thought, yes -- just a thought!, of yielding. Her world is truly stark and Gothic, it's a world of maximalist and dramatic choices -- yes or no, on top or on the bottom, bright or dark. She craves the most violent contrasts and cannot stand living in the zones of shades of grey. She understands only super- or subordination in the purest of forms.Many would probably be correct to argue that Erika's obsession with remaining beyond anybody's influences is in many ways an outcome of her total mental slavery to her mother. And this is obviously a valid point. But the film's posing of the problem of sex in explicit power-related terms, in terms of a power game with fluid rules and irredeemably uncertain outcomes should be the primary focus of analysis. The Piano Teacher's finale is resounding in its relentless dramatism and even stoicism. Erika's conscious pursuit of emotional self-denial for the sake of what she deems her true (and avaricious) God -- self-sufficiency and professional greatness reveals that there is her war with her own humanity and her attempt to become godlike (as one poet said, 'eternal, cold and true'). Her God is completely indifferent to her sufferings and human flaws and needs -- He demands constant sacrifices, demonstrations of loyalty (not unlike Abraham's readiness to slay his own son Isaac at the Almighty's behest). In that sense, her character is not totally unlike the character of the obsessive and self-destructive chess player Alexander Luzhin from The Luzhin Defence or the driven John Nash from The Beautiful Mind (the parallels should not be extended). These movies both show the curative powers of love. There angelical women serve to relieve masculine anguish and self-destructiveness.Here a man discharges this function.Erika's sexuality is a function of all these considerations and complications. As a highly intelligent and sensitive woman, she is aware that any action in a relationship may be interpreted in radically divergent ways. Consequently, she alternates haltingly and hysterically between the sadistic and masochistic modes, obsessing over she is in charge of a relationship. This shows even in the horrendous scene when Erika asks her potential lover Walter to beat her up.Equally interesting and intriguing are the two other main characters in the movie, Walter and Erika's pesky and nosy mother. Walter's deep attraction to Erika reveals his inner demons -- his fantasy to serve as a redeemer, a liberator of sorts for a self-destructive woman. He desires to redeem the male part of humanity by welcoming Erika into the world of normal human sexuality, by curing her of her pains and doubts. The more he takes upon himself the mantle of a heroic redeemer, the more intense her battle of wills with him becomes, the more symbolic her conflicts with him grow. In a sense, Walter loses in the end! He deprives Erika of her virginity but she pretends to be dead and ice-cold during the act the ultimate rejection and delegitimation!Erika's mother is probably the true monster of the movie. Avaricious vampire of a human being. She buzzes with her annoying commentaries and bileful complaints over the viewer's ear like a mosquitto that she is. A spiteful, repulsive character.This is a highly disturbing and extremely thought-provoking movie with absolutely no clear answers. Bravo, Michael Haneke and Isabelle Huppert for a brilliant movie and an equally brilliant and tense performance!

She  lives with her mother (Annie Girardot), a controlling, oppressive woman, and deals with her  erotic longings through voyeurism, visits to sex shops and self mutilation. She still sleeps  with her mother. The film largely takes place at the conservatory where she teaches and at  the apartment she shares with her mother.Huppert in an excellent on-disc interview says Erika longs to be loved but is frightened of  seduction. She treats her students coldly but is drawn to one who is vain and handsome, and  played by Benoit Magimel. The rest is the story of her creating and accepting a masochistic  relationship with the young man that spirals down into her own psycho-sexual collapse.This movie won't be everyone's choice for an evening with the kids. It's a serious, disturbing  film for adults that looks grimly at repressed feelings and emotional self destruction. For the  grownups, it might put you off sado-masochism for a few days. It's a first-rate film.Isabelle Huppert is one of my favorite actors. Like Depardieu, she has no apparent screen  vanity; she'll do what it takes for the role. She also has the rare ability to express deep,  unsettling feelings with an absolute economy of expression. She is incredible in this film.I'm happy to have the movie, but to tell you the truth I'm not sure how many more times I'll  watch it.

I was not so much moved as emotionally shattered. When I left the theatre I had no sense of where I was or what it would take to get home. Now I can write about it, compare it, classify it, and put it out of my mind so I can move on to the next film, anything to distance myself from the experience.This is not an easy film to watch and is difficult to recommend. The images are graphic and, at times, sickening, yet I found The Piano Teacher to be a film that touches the soul and can be overwhelmingly beautiful in its dark poetry. The Piano Teacher continues the theme of alienation of Laurence Cantet's Time Out, but brings it to a new level of separation from feeling and sensitivity. It is a study of the sexual repression of a middle-aged piano teacher (Isabelle Huppert), turned into a perverse, self-hating, and destructive relationship with a student (Benoit Magimel). The brilliant and powerful performances of the actors led to best acting awards for both at last year's Cannes Film Festival. The Piano Teacher is based on a 1983 novel by Elfriede Jelinek in which she drew on her relationship with a domineering mother, and on her own repressed sexuality. Though the film ostensibly takes place in Vienna, there is no real sense of location, only interiors that could be anywhere in the world. This is Never-Never land where nothing ends and nothing begins, Jelinek says. Adding to the intensity, the TV is always on in the apartment as an unwanted and intrusive presence. The Piano Teacher is filled with great music and it is a redeeming quality of the film to be able to listen to beautiful performances of Schubert and Schumann (no relation). Yet Haneke shows us people who are surrounded by great music and are numb to the emotional experience. The characters talk about the great composers with cold and intellectual certainty, yet entirely without passion.In the much-discussed toilet scene, Haneke's camera brings you so close to the action that all you can do is squirm. Although the camera never goes below the waist, the game being played of sexual domination and submission is clearly visible in the facial expressions of the characters. Ultimately, there is no release for the tension created by a character who seems torn between madness and reason, who acts on strange impulses, seems completely estranged from humanity, but remains so deeply human that we can recognize a part of ourselves on the big screen. The temptation is to say these people are not me. They are so sick. Yes, that's true, they are not you, but isn't there is a part of Erika that is becoming more and more recognizable every day? We are increasingly surrounded by people who find it difficult to express emotion, who seek satisfaction but are unable to provide it, who are desensitized to violence and any kind of human empathy, who commit murder to see what it feels like.Haneke's film seems to be challenging the audience's request for sex and violence in movies. From what I have read, he has made a habit of making movies that shock and repel audiences and has decided that filmmakers and audiences alike are responsible for the cycle of creating and consuming violence. In a statement in 1996, Haneke said  My films are polemical statements against the American 'taking -by-surprise-before-one-can-think' cinema and its disempowerment of the spectator. It is an appeal for a cinema of insistent questioning in place of 'false-because-too-quick-answers', for clarifying distance in place of violating nearness. I want the spectator to think. He has definitely made us think and it is not a comfortable experience.

La Pianiste reinforces the Austrians=grim thesis I'm formulating. Isabelle Huppert won a well-deserved Best Actress award at Cannes for her portrayal of a woman who, in her efforts to attain the artistic ideal, loses her humanity. Trapped by her talent, she suppresses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in twisted and terrifying ways. When a younger student falls in love with her, our hopes rise, but are soon dashed by the realization that she cannot experience love the way others can. It is too late for her, and the film's final 30 harrowing minutes are, tellingly, devoid of the beautiful music that carried the first 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it's describing.

Whilst sublimated ,one gets the impression that Erika's mother actually has resented her from birth and secretly desired a boy instead.Further ,Erika's subject of expertise is in the field that her father, who went mad ,pursued (again the mothers influence is seen to play a part).The alienation of Erika through her mother ,has been so complete that she has been unable to enter into any consentual adult emotional exchanges.We observe clear but subtle episodes revealing her mothers place in her world.Erika still sleeps in the same bed as her mother despite having a bedroom of her own.Erika's male interest Walter, says in a pique of rage , your daughter should have a key to her own bedroom .Mother incessantly rings after her when Erika is out giving lessons or playing in private recitals, thereby suggesting that for Erika to be in a place that mother doesn't know about -simply cannot be countenanced.We observe Erika visiting a sex shop booth straight after giving a recital, as if to cleanse herself of the taint of the crushing inner oppression that is her lifestyle, to wash the veneer away for a short time, to shed the straight - jacket.One witnesses a world of grey for Erika,her fierce and resolute exterior masking her inability and her manifest desire to break through such walls.So ,immersed in her lifes work from a young age, endless hours at the keyboard, and with a none-to-subtle rejoinder by mother dear to never ever let them be better than you , Erika craves emotional freedom ,wildly desires to break the shackles but knows in her heart that she in unable to accomplish such  further she knows subconsciously that she no longer knows what this 'freedom' even is.Such ongoing psychological torment, with concomitant repression ,has led Erika to a high degree of helplessness, which in turn has led to self-loathing and has had her integrate such low value of self into her internal workings, which see her using the natural instinct of her libido to manifest her self hatred .Thus her sado masochistic tendencies.We see her blithely engage in genital mutilation and we know she has done this before.She so desires to be loved , knows instinctually how it could be , infers some sense of love's potential from peripheral events around her as she has grown up, but is totally inept in putting such into practice.Her sexual identity ,being inextricably defined now through her self loathing and sadomasochism ,has been steered into fascination with things external ,things that society has taught her are 'sexual'. Since she is granite ,her inured barrier keeping everything external at bay ,she has been able to 'feel' and use her sexual desires in the enjoyment of viewing things that are typically more a male domain.It is clear at the sex shop with video booth ,that she has been here many times before, Erika stares down the loiterers outside the booth, all males who are challenged and feel uncomfortable about a real flesh and blood woman entering their fantasy domain.The way she stares at the screen blankly ,but intently ,whilst inhaling odour of semen shows the inner workings of her turmoil. Her hardened visage is able to comfortably gaze down the men outside but she is more comfortable to watch than engage.Within the context of her classes, her life , she meets Walter ,who shows keen interest in her.We suspect that she is doomed to fail from the start with him. Her life and the film has a pall of inevitable downward spiral with her confronting her psyche, with only one possible outcome.Despite the fact that she tells him i want want you want in a sexual sense ,she also insists many times that he read the list of desires she ,naturally, has written down for him (not told him face to face). Contrary to norms of society that she must be aware of ,she still writes down all the perversions that her self hatred have ,over many many years , seemed to have defined for her as her means of escape from the vacuum of the shell she resides in .She wants to be beaten ,she wants all control stripped from her ,she wants to be hurt ,she wants to be degraded  we have a little girl crying out - in essence she wants to FEEL ,she wants to be LOVED.We are shown Erika late in the film , in bed with her mother , suddenly cry out and look to attack her mother ,try feebly to communicate with her ,to get through.There is a latent desire to strangle her I'm sure in her body language but her efforts don't last long as deep down she knows she can never do it .It is the paradoxical dilemma of having being repressed and sublimated by one individual yet it is that individuals approval that one seeks and which is never forthcoming  thus the vicious circle.We see her place glass into the coat pocket of her top student -Erika feels a little resentment toward her i would suspect in most part because she reminds Erika of herself and it is for this reason Erika places the glass in her pocket so as to help the student escape the morass of a life Erika knows all too well.Erika can see the same behaviours and outcomes with the students mother as her own.It is unconscionable to think of such arrant and willful violence against a young girl but from Erika's perspective ,such an act is somehow breaking the cycle,changing the girls destiny -to Erika ,for the better .Erika does this in a cold callous way from her visage it seems ,but twisted logic suggests it is a 'kind' thing to do. Erika ever so gently chides the girls mother in an interview after the accident, where the mother says we have given up so much( in piano training) and Erika reminds her that it is her daughter that has done so and this is THE central theme of the film.There seems to be a great deal of misunderstanding about this film .Many have labeled Erika 'disgusting' and 'sick'.We are not spoon fed the reason why she is as seen.We are seeing the end product.This film is not like many American releases where the prevailing sensibility is that the audience demand everything be explicated and neatly tied up with overly simplistic reasons for at best, bland motivations.To see Erika as perverted and loathsome ,is to miss the core of the character - she surely should evoke PITY.The sexual minutiae here are not the point.The performance of Huppert is stunning, to say the least.To maintain such neutrality of facial expression ,the merest flicker giving us a clue to Erika and her desires and coping mechanisms.A difficult role ,masterfully handled.Dross in the hands of many, somehow utterly poignant and meaningful as seen through her subtleties.The nub of the film , as i saw it, was the scene where Walter storms in and is determined to somehow 'give her what she wants'.The fantasy Erika has constructed for herself (her sadomasochistic wishes as described above) , that somehow to her were to be liberating ,fulfilling or just plain validating ,go horribly horribly wrong.The one idea that she had built up and held onto for years ,the wanton expression of her libido ,where she could eschew control and somehow regain indepence of self, of spirit ,of something (this film never pretends to be neat and easy) turns out to be an utterly pathetic ,degrading ,dispiriting misery.She is hit and kicked in the face ,and lies there in her own blood, and she is not free.She lies there bewildered,apathetic, half whispering to please stop, and it dawns on her that the tightly constructed mechanism that had become her fantasy was nothing short of a farce.She lies there and it dawns on her that even her inner hope has failed her , been nothing like she imagined and that her drab existence will not change, her psychological conundrum will not be resolved.Of course - there was no other possible outcome.In a final denouement and act of rebellion - importantly done in a way where no one sees - Erika goes to the recital that the student can no longer perform -as Erika's mother says its ONLY a recital - in the deserted foyer knowing she will leave the audience sitting there waiting - stabs herself in the upper left chest - clearly stabbing for the heart, a death blow intended.The tortured look on Hupperts face for a brief moment is in stark contrast to the usual way we see her -maybe we are peering into her soul and witnessing her beast.Perhaps it is a symbol of the heart needing to be excised , it has taken too much suffering.As we see her walk away and out of building with a wound, we are left piteously wondering...saddened.

It is not the Caffe Latte S&M of pretty young twentysomethings exploring their boundaries here, it delves into the true nature of sexual perversity. Her character is a middle aged loner, successful musician and teacher , but incapable of having any type of life let alone a functioning relationship.Her sex life is also one of unhealthy obsession involving frequenting sex shops, voyeurism and sexual self mutilation. It also gets revealed as the film progresses that she holds deeply disturbing sexual fantasies that involve humiliation and violence being committed upon her. When she becomes involved with a student who has become infatuated with her, and tries to achieve the emotional salvation she longs for by sharing these obsessions with the young man there is tragic results., Loneliness is a terrible burden to bear and part of the strength of the film is that the director, never reduces Huppert to a freak show. Her pain is apparent even though she is at many times a fairly odious (and occasionally downright psycopathic character) Hints of what has led her to this situation are given, the unhealthy co-dependant relationship she has with her mother, the perfectionism and driven nature that pervades her working life, madness in the family.In the end it doesnt really matter how it came about as it is an examination of a person in that state and how they fall apart both emotionally and mentally that is being examined here. There are many scenes which stayed in my mind long after the film ended 2 particular scenes stood out for meThe scene both embarassing,horrific and also incredibly sad as the young student reads with disgust a letter Huppert has written to him in front of her detailing her sadomashocistic fantasies that she harbours.We are torn between horror at the graphic nature of the degradation she fetishizes and feel sorry for the horrible and humiliating rejection she receives at the hands of the young student.Also the gut wrenching final scene , the act of self mutilation and look of madness and despair on her face, the director has captured the despair and horror of so much of human existence.An important film to see but dont expect to be uplifted!

Within this short space of time our senses have been assaulted convincingly with very real characters. We are also swept away by powerfully performed music and shown the difference between great and mediocre performance with a lot of attention to nuance. Such material alone would have been the basis for an outstanding film of widespread appeal. But the trend in French cinema being what it is, it goes deeper, exploring the repressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent breakdown within a context of passionate attraction, and the inevitable cycle of real abuse. We are drawn to her suffering and, at least initially, wonder how much suffering may be related to the accomplishment of genius, particularly in the composers she admires. The Piano Teacher contains graphic dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people might rather not watch. The scenes are essential to the dilemmas which the film seeks to raise and so can hardly be called gratuitous. A great film it may be, but mainstream viewing it is not.

It packs a punch because whatever her deeply ingrained character flaws, however reprehensible her behaviour (and at one point that's VERY), the piano teacher Erika always retains your sympathy - you never forget the type of influences which might have made her what she is, while scenes as subtle as the one where she walks down a street of shoppers, being casually bumped into without apology, remind you of her utter isolation. Isabelle Huppert's performance is as brilliant as it is uncomfortable and I can't even imagine how she might have wound down after a day's filming.Appalling, compelling, horribly funny at times, but ultimately deeply despairing look at how people damage each other.

I can't think of many contemporary Hollywood actresses who could have played this role as convincingly. 'The Piano Teacher' is not for those who can't face the dark side of human nature. It's far from being a life affirming feel good movie. If the difficult subject matter of 'Irreversible' or 'The War Zone' interested you then this is your kind of movie.

Haneke reels us in with the lure of golden boy,  Benoit Magimel, but this is an anti-romance as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller.  You'll have to force yourself to watch much of it and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release but it's incredibly nervy and thought provoking; Haneke continues to hold up a mirror to how desensitised Western civilization is or has become.  People may turn their noses up at this but it's only taking what Solondz did in Happiness a few steps further.  While grounded in reality, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be viewed as emotional metaphor.

Erika is transfixed as she watches the things that are being performed on the screen. On another occasion, Erika comes to a drive-in where a movie is in progress. Her attention goes toward a parked car in which, two lovers are performing a sex act. The camera lingers on Erika as she is lost in reverie watching what the two lovers are doing, until she is surprised by the young man inside the car. Erika flees horrified she's been discovered.When a wealthy couple invites Erika to perform in a recital in their opulent home, she meets an eager young man, Walter, who is related to the hosts. Walter is immediately taken with Erika's playing; the young man is a talented pianist himself. His eagerness to compliment Erika is met with skepticism on her part. Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class, and is accepted.Thus begins Walter pursuit of Erika, who is taken aback when she realizes what the young man's motives really are. In turn, Erika, begins to fantasize about Walter in ways that only her mind could, imagining what she would like him do when, and if, they get together. Walter gets turned off by the letter Erika has written to him, detailing sexual acts that are repugnant to the young man.The film's ending, reminded us of the last sequence of Mr. Haneke's current Cache. We are taken to a concert hall where Erika is going to perform. She is seen stalking the lobby looking for the arrival of Walter, who goes on into the hall without noticing her. Erika's expression to the camera reveals a lot more of her state of mind in that last minutes of the film. As she flees the lobby area after inflicting a wound on herself, the camera abandons her and concentrates on the building's facade that seems to stay on the screen for a long time.La Pianiste is a personal triumph for Isabelle Huppert. This magnificent actress does one of her best appearances on the screen, guided by the sure hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Ms. Huppert's works with economic gestures, yet, she projects so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika.The supporting cast does wonders under the director's guidance. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect as Erika's mother. She seems to be the key of whatever went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest that is played with subtleness in the context of the film. Benoit Magimel is perfectly cast as Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the film as the young man, so in love with a woman that is possessed by demons, that he'll never be able to chase away or get her to love him in a normal manner.Michael Haneke films are always disturbing to watch, yet they offer so many rewards because he dares to go where other men don't. The magnificent music heard in the film are mainly by Schubert and Schumann, two composers that are Erika's own favorites. The movie is helped tremendously by Christian Berger's cinematography. "},{"Title":"More brilliance from Haneke","Date":"19 June 2002","Score":"11 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  The only director who really matters right now is Michael Haneke.  The 60-ish Austrian is only just now becoming known to American audiences (despite having been making films for a decade), because in this age of false freedom and faux radicalization, he's the real thing a genuine free thinker and radical. This makes his work scarily demanding, but on top of that, it's also relentlessly un-sensational while he works on only the most extreme ideas and projects, Haneke suppresses all superficial gratification.  Heads don't blow off, guns never fire, and nothing ever explodes - even though there's a high degree of emotional violence, the release mechanisms of cinema are completely suppressed.  Catharsis is to be excised, avoided, or parodied; Aristotle's polemics are treated as laughably passe; most of Haneke's work ends abruptly, intentionally doesn't resolve, or actually re-starts at square one.  As a result, his movies have been called torture mechanisms, although his method is completely understandable in a world of movies designed entirely as mindless catharsis, Haneke is staking out its antithesis as the province of his art he's focusing on what everyone else has been avoiding. The results can be cruel but are always exhilarating.   Even I can't quite recommend Funny Games, in which he turns the revenge cheapie (think Last House on the Left) on the audience itself, forcing the viewer to suffer along with his victims.  With its suffocated family dog, obliterated little boy, and eventual meta-narrative, Funny Games is probably the most disturbing intellectual statement since A Clockwork Orange. But while at first I felt that Haneke was Kubrick's heir, I'm becoming more and more aware of his debts to Kieslowski. In structural terms, Kubrick worked musically, and tried to impregnate the image itself with a novelistic depth. Haneke, on the other hand, avoids impressing us with his technique; instead he designs submerged structures and paradigms which illuminate but never directly state their themes.   There's never a memorable shot in Haneke, much less a clever camera angle, or dazzling sequence; he simply disdains all that; he doesn't love light, or edit with a sense of rhythm; somehow he just knows how to grip you without them.  In Code Unknown he actually parodies the tracking shot - sometimes the camera keeps going when the characters have stopped, sometimes vice versa.  In fact the one masterfully suspenseful sequence in the movie turns out to be a film WITHIN the film - Haneke just throws it in there to show that yes, he knows exactly how to do that, too. Which brings us to his latest, The Piano Teacher, with Isabelle Huppert, the first of his films to achieve even an arthouse release in the U.S., and certainly the most interesting film so far this year.  Part of this new visibility, of course, is due to Huppert's presence, and part of it is due to the subject matter everybody thinks they understand movies about frigid, bitchy women who are sexually perverted, and everyone expects them to be dirtily exciting beneath a patina of intellectual respect. In other words, they're dependable arthouse fodder, since that crowd loves nothing more than looking down its nose at other people's sexual mores. Of course, with Haneke, the arthouse is in for a surprise.  Rather like those who were shocked that Eyes Wide Shut did not give them an erection, some critics have had to turn away from scenes in which the main character nonchalantly sniffs semen-crusted tissues in a porno booth, or cuts her labia with a razor to simulate menstruation.  What's almost worse is that these events usually occur just out of our line of sight, turning us into failed voyeurs - the furtive sex all happens with the characters mostly clothed, although their note-perfect performances tell you exactly where they are in the course of each act.   This is de rigeur for Haneke, but it sends some folks into a  tizzy (Where's the sudden, split-second shot of the bloody wound to make me scream?   They can sense Haneke is messing with them, but unlike with, say, Tarentino, they can't figure out why.  There are no ironically-framed immature gratifications here; what's all this FOR? (They just can't figure out that they have to figure it out.) To be fair, there's a lot to figure out.   Most critics have grabbed onto the old repression handle to explain Huppert's character, Erika Kohut, a sadistic piano teacher at a top Viennese academy.  Erika lives alone with her aging mother (Annie Girardot)  in an abusive psychological marriage in which the two women even sleep in two beds pushed together.  So the repression handle seems good as far as it goes, but it doesn't really go very far - Mother's comment that we're a passionate family after Erika hits her full in the face is the first hint that repression ain't what this is all about. Erika's relationship with her mother may be the starting point for her emotional state, but she's hardly repressed in fact, she's in full, chilly flower.  She has her own theory of Schubert (her specialty) - something about being poised at the brink of madness, and the composer's desolate Winterreise is practically her theme, with its creepy lyrics about hounds pulling at their chains.  Erika is fully conscious of her desires, and knows exactly what she wants - she just can't get it in the normal course of human events.  So she's reduced to various forms of voyeurism.  Perhaps the film's eeriest image is of her wandering among the cars at a drive-in movie (in Vienna?) like a lonely ghost; she's looking for a couple in coitus to watch and climax with (and eventually she finds one, with humiliating results). Clearly, she equates romantic ecstasy with cruelty (which is not the same thing as repression) - and music itself, which operates in the film as a metaphor for love, has become a theater of sadism for her.  She berates and humiliates her students, even mutilating the hands of one (this scene, in which Erika places broken glass in the girl's pockets, is one of the most chilling evocations of malice aforethought in all film). Into this frozen maelstrom wanders Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a young pianist who's handsome, talented, sweet, and conceited.  Klemmer is intrigued, then obsessed by Erika's icy disdain for his charms - which we can tell have always gotten him exactly what he wanted.  Using his frustration as leverage, Erika slowly ropes him into becoming her partner in her own version of love.  This involves, of course, sadomasochism and degradation - only it's to be performed per her instructions exactly (and they run to several pages, single-spaced), in a way which will take vengeance on (of course) her mother. Klemmer declares Erika sick - he's used to the usual give-and-take of standard sex, and he certainly doesn't hate women.  But as he appreciates that domination of Erika physically actually means submission to her WILL, he reacts in a way that is subtly horrifying.  Here Haneke plays his hidden trump card, for in Klemmer's forcing of normal lovemaking on Erika, we perceive that he is actually committing rape.  In a word, he breaks her, and we can tell that she'll never recover.  Her last horrifying gesture (and Huppert is unforgettable) somehow combines rejection with a kind of animal-like defiance. As usual, Haneke has sprung a kind of trap, and turned the tables on the audience.  How are we to dismiss Erika, when her perversities - all mirror images of idealized love - have produced such a cruel reaction in her sunny love-god - and in us?  We're left floating in a kind of moral netherworld, like the singer of Winterreise, in which we appreciate that our erotic pleasures have always had their dark twin of erotic disgust.  And how are to say that this dark twin can't produce the same kind of transcendence?  We deny it with no authority, as we - with Klemmer - are provoked to actual domination of Erika, just as she wished, but this time in OUR control, not hers.  We want to hurt her - but why? The Piano Teacher, of course, is therefore concerned with the most basic issues of humanism - but it's an inquiry, not a treatise (this is where Haneke differs from his character, although they certainly share something in common).  Unlike what all the pop critics label subversive, this movie is ACTUALLY subversive - it gets under your assumptions and stays there. And for this, of course, it will probably be limited to a short run on the East and West coasts.  But watch for it on video.

It's difficult to watch at times, if you take it seriously. But I think it was difficult to film, to write, to act. The premise is subtle even if it sounds sensational--show the inner mind and inner life of a brilliant woman who is mentally ill. She has compulsive issues, I think, and sexual repression that has led her to masochistic and finally sadistic extremes. She is admirable in some external way for her self-control which reads, to an outsider, as cold precision, the kind needed to be an extraordinary classical pianist.But the movie takes us inside her life, first to the unhealthy relationship with her mother, then the oddly stern and indifferent role she takes with her advanced students. Finally there is a young man who sees only her ability, and her external beauty. (This woman, Erika, is played by the incomparable Isabelle Huppert.) He is a pianist of unusual talent, but he wants not to concertize, but to live life. He plays hockey. He has friends. He smiles warmly. He is, in short, a healthy normal and rather handsome young man.And he falls for Erika. This is where the movie gets weirder and weirder, but also more challenging. They play an intense game of sexual chicken, at first, and lots of head games. He knows she's superior to him in some way--older, more severe---but he has no idea about her slanted view of life and of sex. He wants her. He becomes a pupil of hers just for that reason. She pretends not to care, or to rebuff him (in part this isn't pretense because she's afraid). Finally a couple of serious and demented confrontations occur. And things unravel in a very interesting way. Some people will find it simply sick and unwatchable. It also happens very slowly--if the film has an obvious flaw, it's the pace. It's in love with itself far too much. But if you get into that flow, and can take the pain that will rise up, then you will at least be greatly affected. That's more than most movies can say.It's all quite in ernest. I don't think it's a bit campy or playing games with the viewer. It's really trying to get at this woman's psyche--and the young man's, since he gets in deeper than he intended. It's filmed with terrific planning and visual panache. And it makes some kind of deranged sense, too. In fact, there are probably more people in these kinds of situations than I'll even know, and to them I say give this a careful look.

It's always the detached, the reserved and the remote who turn out to be the kinkiest. But then again, if you were in your forties, still lived at home and had a possessive mother, you might be a bit off-kilter too.The opening to The Piano Teacher sees Erika (Isabelle Huppert), a rather prim middle-aged woman, returning home only to be confronted by her mother. Her mother is outraged that she's late and she wants to know where she's been. She even grabs Erika's purse and checks her bankbook! Erika then grabs her mother by the hair while they call each other names. But after a brief tussle they're in each other's arms, apologising for their behaviour. These two people are highly dependant on one another. And in a weird way they're more like a married couple than mother and daughter; they even sleep in the same bed. Needless to say, it's not a particularly healthy domestic situation.A description of the opening scene would kind of suggest that Erika is perhaps a shy character, someone who's been bullied ceaselessly by a parent and someone who, as a result, is lacking in confidence. But actually Erika is supremely confident. She's also extremely intelligent and authoritative &#150; her students are in awe of her and are probably more than a little bit scared of her, too. But for whatever reason she's locked in this hellish relationship with her mother.Near the beginning of the film there's a moment when mother and daughter are going to a recital. They get into one of those old-fashioned lifts, and just as they're closing the metal screen, a young man runs to get in with them. They slam the screen shut on him. The outside world is being locked out. However, the young man is going to the same recital, so they meet him again. And the man, who introduces himself as Walter, tries his best to charm Erika. But all the while her mother is watching from a distance with jealous eyes.Eventually Walter becomes a student of Erika's. However, at first she's not too happy about it. She says he's not motivated enough and she says he's too showy. In a way she's unnerved by him because he's the complete opposite of her. But she's also kind of attracted. When Walter plays at the recital she goes from not being interested to being silently captivated &#150; she even manages something approaching a smile. And then when she becomes his tutor, and after it becomes clear that Walter's interested in her, she follows him after lessons &#150; and again she manages something like a smile when she sees him playing ice hockey.But the extent of Erika's feelings aren't known until a scene during a concert rehearsal. One of her pupils, a timorous young girl, is supposed to be playing piano. But she turns up late and she's so nervous she's got diarrhoea. This propels Walter into action. He becomes her knight in shining armour; he puts his arm around her, makes her laugh and gives her confidence. But Erika, jealous at the attention her highly-strung student is getting, quietly exits the hall and heads for where all the coats are being kept. She then puts broken glass in the pockets of the girl's jacket. Erika's envy is quiet but deadly.But Erika also harms herself. There's one scene where she calmly and methodically uses a mirror to cut her private parts. Completely smothered, this is one of her few outlets. But she can't even cut herself without her mother interrupting her by calling dinner. However, Erika is well used to this and efficiently cleans up the bathroom. And there's a nice touch of dark humour when the mother sees blood on her daughter's ankle. She thinks she's menstruating and uses that to explain her daughter's mood.But sex is where the real Erika comes out. In one scene she goes to a sex shop to watch hardcore porn. She even sniffs a pile of used tissues. But what's most telling is how the men in the shop react. Erika is completely comfortable. The men, though, are rather disturbed. They don't want a real woman shattering the fantasies they're there to indulge.And you could argue that the film is partly about men's unease with female sexuality. For example, Walter worships Erika and says he's in love with her, but when she opens up to him he's disgusted. He didn't know what Erika liked &#150; she writes a letter, telling him her desires; she wants to be tied up and beaten. This doesn't fit into his preconceived idea of her, and as a result, he's thoroughly repulsed.But what's great about the film is that it doesn't judge Erika. We're not asked to laugh at her or consider her nothing more than an oddity. After all, it's probably easier to change the colour of the sky than it is to change someone's sexual desires. No, what's disgusting is Walter's reaction to Erika. She begins to open up to him, to show some vulnerability, and rather than handle the situation like a man and say that he's not interested in that sort of thing, he humiliates her. And he doesn't humiliate her once, he does it a number of times.And this of course leads to the savagely unhappy ending. Erika is due to perform in a concert, but she waits in the lobby for Walter to appear &#150; she has a knife in her purse. But when he arrives, he arrives in a large group and she can only watch. She then takes the knife and stabs herself. It seems that she's aiming for her heart but she only gets her shoulder. Then she calmly leaves and walks off. She's not dead, but she might as well be; she'll never open up to anyone again.

For example, I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, regarding the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). I mean D/s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological; it isn't. In general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.So, for me, I feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film, worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories (isn't it nearly embarrassing?), and that does not really relate with real-life lives and experiences of those engaged in D/s relationships (personal experience, forums, irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this).

This is what led me to get the DVD for La Pianiste, which I just finished watching about a half hour ago.It's all been expressed, here at IMDb and in many of the external reviews - the gruesomely twisted pathology that would 'create' an individual like Huppert's Erika, who is still trying, after years and years, to please her mother, at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life, beginning with her self. She's repressed everything that would free her from her self-imposed bondage, including, of course, her sexuality, which has literally imploded, to the point of madness, to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving impulse would feel like.This is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional cripple, one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a functioning adult. I think this subject relates to all of us - we're all striving for autonomy, but there are needs, so many conflicting needs, most of which are not even on the conscious level. It also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one fantasizes about, sexually, and the reality of those fantasies, as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being. Huppert's character gets what she asks for in the course of the film, and it is hardly the emancipating experience she had imagined it to be. Regarding the much-discussed scene in the bathroom I really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge (for the viewer, I mean) sucked out of it because of the prior scene, where she put the glass in the girl's pocket. By the time she's acting out her let's-see-if-this-guy-is-worthy scenario in the bathroom, we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on, her little domination session with our poor unsuspecting dupe.I think another incredible achievement of this movie is how, about halfway through it, I completely forgot that it was not in English and that I was reading sub-titles. That has never happened before, in any foreign movie, and I've seen quite a few. In this film, like Cache, the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little tidy bow, but unlike Cache, we do at least get some sense of finality, despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether Huppert's character is alive or dead. After experiencing La Pianiste, when it comes to Michael Haneke, I am, needless to say, more than a trifle intrigued.

Time went on but I could not get the movie and its main character, Erika Kahut out of my mind. The story of a respected Piano teacher in Vienna Conservatory, cool and collected on the surface, an expert in classical music, with the inner world so dark and disturbing with the demons of fear, self-loathing and self destruction strong enough to ruin her demanded more than one viewing. I read the book The Piano Teacher by Elfriede Jelinek, the controversial Nobel Prize winner in literature that the film is based on and after reading it I saw the film again. Second time, all pieces of puzzle came to the right places. Not very often an outstanding harrowing book is transferred to the screen with such brilliancy as Le Pianiste. Three actors gave outstanding performances. Franz Schubert's Piano music, soaked in the morbid humanity, is another bright star of the movie.I only have one problem with Haneke's vision. There is a scene in the film where Haneke made some changes to Erika's character comparing to the novel. In the book, the furthest she went to reveal herself to Walter, the young student in the conservatory who became attracted to her, was in a letter. As soon as he realized what he was dealing with and showed to her how much he was repulsed by that, she had stopped communicating with him. Erika of the book would never chase Walter to throw herself to him. She kept everything inside - she did not like to act, she was not a chaser - she loved to watch. The big scene during the hockey game was not necessary. It tried to make Erika sympathetic (and of course, Huppert was heartbreaking) but it took the mystery that surrounded her - Jelinek did not write that scene, it sounded and looked false in otherwise excellent film.

I'm not sure the movie would work without the great, haughty, fierce, indomitable, unforgettable Isabelle Huppert.  Often Huppert has been cold and cruel and elegant and desirable, but never has she been so sick and twisted as here, and she goes the limit.  There is no more fearless and confident actress in movie history and none I'd go so out of my way to watch. I gritted my teeth and entered the theater expecting no fun.  The opening credits won me over, though.  The way the sound ends when the names come on, between each vignette, show an ability to make you take notice, to make the routine fresh.  Each vignette is different; in each Erika Kohut, the piano teacher (Huppert) is cruel to another piano student in a different way. I could see something compulsively watchable coming. When the razor-in-the-bathroom scene came, I looked away  I'd been warned. Then I peeked it wasn't so bad.  Most of all, it was swift and methodical; she's as dispassionately cruel toward herself as she is toward others.  It's a job to get done in time for dinner  mom's calling.Besides Huppert, the young actor who plays Walter Klemmer (BenoÃ®t Magimel) is remarkable.  Like his character, he appears ordinary, good but not great looking, too confident, boringly relaxed, but he surprises you by keeping up with Huppert every step of the way just as his character does.  These two come together in ways I've not seen before on screen.  The transgressive sex scenes are surprising from minute to minute and both characters are dynamic beyond all expectation.  Both are conceived as contradictions.  Erika is brilliant about music, insane about human relations.  Walter is a normal guy, a hockey coach, a future engineer, but he plays piano recklessly and brilliantly and his musical thinking is mature.  He is ready for the battleground that is Huppert's Erika and when they clash in horrible sexual warfare, both are changed.  He pops back, but is drawn into her sadomasochistic games.  She loses it and is going through a series of meltdowns, yet she remains visibly enough in control to be expected to play piano at a major recital when she has disabled her female student.  Huppert is remarkable, but Magimel is completely authentic in all the most intense and ruthlessly intimate sex scenes  he knows exactly what he needs to do.`La Pianiste' in other words is actor-driven, so when it won the Grand Prize at Cannes it was inevitable that Huppert and Magimel would get the Best Actress and Best Actor awards.  It's hard to conceive the movie without them.  The Grand Prize also signals recognition of Haneke as a major European filmmaker.  Is it a desire to transcend his Austrian culture and become more pan-European that has led him to make his last two movies in French, and set `Code Unknown,' also a controversial film, in Paris?  Why specifically does everyone in `La Pianiste,' which takes place mainly at the Vienna Conservatory, speak French?  To accommodate Huppert?  To modulate the cold Teutonic tone of the Austrian novel the movie's based on?  Or perhaps &#150; my theory &#150; to make the whole story more abstract &#150; because it's not just about sadomasochistic craziness but about cloying family ties, frustration, and abusive mentors, especially piano teachers?  Rumor has it that piano teachers are sometimes as cruel as this.  They just don't have Huppert's chutzpah, froideur, and elegant sexiness.  In a way this is a fantasy about what a really, really mean piano teacher might be like in her spare time if our worst nightmares about her were true.  This story is, certainly, about our worst nightmares, our repressions, the things we've imagined that we don't want to talk about, the sickness in our relationship with our mother and with our lovers.  To deal with desperation and human limits is not to step away completely from everyday experience but to examine it under a microscope.  Haneke takes us to places we have been before in our minds and in our emotions.Walter (Magimel) is the voice of normality.  He's a nice guy, a friendly, self confident, healthy, helpful athlete  he's a little like Wayne Gretsky. But though he laughs when he reads Erika's kinky, sick instructions for their sexual relations, then tells her she disgusts him and he will have no more to do with her, he's in love with her, so he winds up little by little starting to follow the instructions in spite of himself.  Because of his admiration and love, he becomes another person.  `La Pianiste' is about crossing the line, losing control in a world (like a conservatory of music) where control is the watchword.  Walter laughs for us; he expresses our discomfort with Erika's insanity, and thus, as over-the-top as the movie becomes, we stay with it and disquietingly within it.This is a transgressive analysis of emotion that's true to general human experience.  I've been emotionally strung out with a lover (who hasn't?) and all this craziness spoke to my own emotional memories.  `La Pianiste' has disgusting things in it, and I'm no masochist &#150; not even as a moviegoer &#150; but this is a terrific movie, perhaps a great one.

Her novel spawned a film that won second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads. Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes?'Gobble, gobble' is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey. In the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception. 'Gobble, gobble' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners.The embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated. It begins very badly, as if made to annoy the viewer. Credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes. We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut, apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress, a stony professor of piano. She lives with her husky and domineering mum. Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action.Reviewing The Piano Teacher is difficult, beyond registering its unpleasantness. What we see in the film (and might read in the book, for all I know) is a tawdry, exploitative, nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on.Erika, whose name is minimally used, is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed. Not quite, because there's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies. If a reviewer has to (yawn) extract a leitmotif (why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do), Elrika's violently alternating moods would be it.A young hunk, Walter, studying to become a 'low voltage' engineer, whatever that is, and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments, is also a talented pianist. He encounters Elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris. In the glib fashion of so much art, he immediately falls in love and starts to 'cherchez la femme'.Repressed Erika has a liking for hardcore pornography, shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches.Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika, whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness, hostility, discouragement and humiliation.He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex. Erika retains control over her lovesick swain. She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges.In the meantime, chillingly jealous because of Walter's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert, Erika fills the student's coat pocket with broken glass, causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands.The next big scene (by-passing the genital self-mutilation, etc) has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother. Erika want to be humiliated, bound, slapped, etc. Sensible Walter is, for the moment, repulsed and marches off into the night.At this point there's still nearly an hour to go. The viewer can only fear the worst. Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice. They retire to a back room. Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers. His 'baby gravy' is soon expelled with other stomach contents. Ho hum.Repulsed but hooked, perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor, Walter returns to Erika's apartment. Can you guess what happens now? It's not very deep or difficult. Yes, he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim. One moment he's locking maman in her room and slapping Erika, the next he's kicking her in the face, having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love. Am I being unfair in this summary? Watch the film if you want, but I'd advise you not to.Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they're in the right mood. I could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted. But I 'prefer not to', because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing.I'm supposed to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love, ineffectively seeks it in pornography, inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears, pink and throbbing, under her nose, belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt, blah, blah, blah.The world has, for reasons not explained, stunted her. She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist, because that's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise.At the end, if you have the patience to be there, there's a small twist. Before going to the final scene, where she's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands, Erika packs a knife in her handbag. For Walter?Yes, you're ahead of me. She stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves. Roll credits.If this earned the second prize at Cannes, just how bad were the rest of the entries?

If there is, I don't want to meet that person. This is a film so twisted and uncomfortable that it would send the sadomasochistic characters of David Lynch's Blue Velvet running for the hills. And yet at the same time, unpleasant and disturbing as it is, the film is also a very powerful piece of psychological study. Yes, it is as messed-up and off-putting as its protagonist, but it's also fascinating.The said protagonist is a sexually repressed pianist played by the wonderful French actress Isabelle Huppert. She glides into her perverted character so easily that one wonders if and how much she messed herself up in real life to do it so well. Dodging her bossy mother's questions and peeping, she spends her days denouncing and bemocking her students and her evenings stepping into porno booths and, in one of the film's most shocking scenes, peeking around drive-ins, hoping to catch somebody coupling in the backseat. Everything, most of all her psychological state, comes crashing down when she takes on a talented new pupil (Benoit Magimel) who has romantic designs on her. Only he doesn't realize just what kind of a sick, twisted monster he has taken a shine to.The Piano Teacher is two hours of sheer disgust. Those with weak stomachs steer clear. For two hours it astonished me, repelled me, and made my stomach flip and turn inside of me. The characters - every single one of them - are entirely unsympathetic. Even the mother, wonderfully acted by the late Annie Girardot, is hardly the straight-arrow she tries to make herself out to be. The one and only time that I placed myself in the shoes of a character was when one turned to Miss Huppert after one of her masochistic rants, and plainly told her You are sick. You need help. And yet all she does in cause pain and displeasure to others, and to herself, and we are left to watch and see just how far she can really go.The Piano Teacher is not a good movie-going experience and I would probably be happy never seeing it again. It's too rough-going. So why am I still recommending the movie, and so highly? Because, for that one viewing, it commanded my attention and left me fascinated by what I was seeing why I was being simultaneously disgusted. It's like studying a pathologically sick individual, except that you are able to observe from a safe distance. And there is no safer distance than a movie screen. For those who admire psychology - and I most certainly do - it is a compelling experience as well as nasty one. It is also one of those pictures, whether or not you have seen a sadism or masochism on the screen before, you might never want to see it again.It is hard to express my aesthetic admiration of this picture without coming across as a total sicko. And I can imagine some doubting my rating and recommendation since I would be perfectly happy never seeing this movie again. It is surely one of those things that should be visited once and then studied, pondered about, and contemplated. In spite of how uncomfortable it made me feel, and the sour taste it left my mouth afterward, I cannot deny the visceral power of this psychological melodrama and that it left me fascinated at the end.

While we may watch the movie, with a mixture of fascination and discomfort, to see what music teacher and accomplished pianist Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) will do next, there is little point in wondering why she does it, since the reasons for her irrational behaviour seem to be buried deep in her psyche, and have little to do with the circumstances or people around her. Initially, we may deduce that her behaviour is due to her domineering mother (Annie Girardot); but later we may think that her mother is more victim than perpetrator. To be specific, Erika's behaviour includes self-mutilation, voyeurism, sadism, masochism, and exhibitionism in the sexual arena; as well as cruelty, harshness and hypocrisy in her everyday life. True, several of these traits are probably only latent, until Erika encounters Walter (Benoit Magimel), a brash young pupil, who genuinely finds her attractive, and is only too willing to have the straightforward sexual coupling with her, that many would think she truly craves. But instead, she will only settle for an unconventional liaison, that she then finds herself unable to fulfil. The film ends with a gesture that I won't give away because it would rank as a spoiler, but which in any case is as puzzling as most of Erika's conduct.A definite reason to see the movie is for Huppert's brilliant performance. One has to admire the sheer dedication to her art that led an actress of her calibre to accept such an unpleasant and unsympathetic role (and probably for money that would count as small change in Hollywood). You might think another plus would be the piano music, mostly Schubert. But, to my ear, apart from a bravura piano duet, much of the music is heavy and unattractive, though I don't know whether this is due to the choice of pieces or their execution.

I am never quite sure of the meaning behind that penetrating look.  Is it an invitation to witness her sexual degradation and in so doing experience the titillation of voyeurism or is she reproaching me for being the clandestine evesdropper that I immediately became when I parted with my money at the box office?  I don't know.  All I am sure of is that the film is teasing me in a strangely perverse way, forcing me to question why I am so intrigued by a work that many have branded as loathsome.  I suppose the answer has to be that I have never before come across a film that has dealt so explicitly with the theme of the correlation between genius and madness, great art and depravity.  No other film bids us examine in quite the same way a respectable society (a mid-European Conservatoire) in which one of its most highly esteemed professors a formidably gifted teacher of the piano) is masking from the world her depraved sexual fantasies.  At first she keeps her double life in separate compartments, teaching by day and visiting hard porn shows by night.  But as this is a film about the abyss into which the sexually deranged can so easily fall, the two worlds inevitably become mixed.  The catalyst that brings this about is a handsome young male student to whom she extends her sado-masochistic style of teaching to sexual acts that she deliberately leaves unfulfilled.  Before long there is an encounter between them in the very toilets of the hallowed conservatoire to be followed a few meetings later by a singularly shocking scene in a sports hall changing room where she vomits his semen.  But possibly the most disturbing of the film's implications is the possible link between great music and madness and depravity.  It can be no coincidence that the piano teacher's specialisms are Schumann and Schubert and although links with the latter are difficult to substantiate, Schumann certainly died insane, as, in a brief reference, did the piano teacher's father.  Is the great art that moves so-called cultured audiences only made possible through  obscenities of the type that director Michael Haneke dares to show us?  As a composer myself, I felt quite torn apart by what I had just experienced in an Auckland arthouse cinema last November.  I made for nearby Albert Park and wandered for a good half-hour just breathing fresh air to get something of this frightening film out of my system.  It took me several days to get over it during the course of which I often felt physically ill and depressed.  On my return to England I caught up with The Piano Teacher again only to find that much of the element of shock had dissipated with time.  But then isn't that always the case with cinema!  Genuinely affecting works of art such as Bicycle Theives and The World of Apu remain moving experiences for ever but works of horror such as Psycho or shockability such as The Piano Teacher lose their initial effect obliging us to focus on other aspects if they are to retain their viability.  In the case of The Piano Teacher it is a great perfomance with the power to force viewers to examine their motivation in watching that remains its most durable quality.     <div class=yn id=ynd_749307>  <form method=get    action=/register/login  > Was the above review useful to you?   <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit   name=ynb_749307_yes value=Yes    rel=login   > <input class=click linkasbutton-secondary type=submit  name=ynb_749307_no value=No   rel=login   >  </form>  </div>  <hr noshade=1 size=1 width=50% align=center>  <div> <small>4 out of 6 people found the following review useful</small> <a href=/user/ur1390493/><img class=avatar src=http//ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NDEyMjYyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM3MDk0OQ@@._SX40_SY40_SS40_.jpg height=$avatar.image.size width=$avatar.image.size></a> <h2>I still have goose pimples...</h2> <img width=102 height=12 alt=8/10 src=http//i.media-imdb.com/images/showtimes/80.gif> Author <a href=/user/ur1390493/>Superunknovvn</a> <small>from Austria, Vienna</small> <small>5 November 2003</small>  "},{"Title":"I still have goose pimples...","Date":"5 November 2003","Score":"5 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":""},{"Title":"Painful and demands almost too much from the viewer (potential spoiler)","Date":"13 November 2005","Score":"6 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":""},{"Title":"And the point was.....?","Date":"21 November 2006","Score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":""},{"Title":"heavy","Date":"6 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":""}{"Title":"A  nauseating film.","Date":"20 March 2006","Score":"14 out of 26 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" A Really Mixed Up Movie.

She is harshly and destructively critical of her pupils to the point of sadism. But she has secrets. She likes to go to sleazy sex-shops and watch porn in the cabins. While there, she picks up discarded semen soaked waste and holds it to her nose. Later, just before the evening meal she takes a razor blade to her vulva and cuts it (Don't ask me why. Most cutters restrict themselves to their arms and legs). There is much blood, but she seems to get no pain from the operation, or enjoyment come to that. The scene gets close to farce. She is called to dinner during the operation, and one can imagine her calling out, I'll be there in a minute mother. I am just cutting my labia. A talented boy is given to her as a scholarship pupil. Initially she is bitterly against him because he is an engineering student and she refuses to believe that an engineer can have musical talent.She has a mousy but talented female student. She puts broken glass into the girl's coat pocket which cuts her hand badly (Don't ask me why she does this).The boy falls in love with her and follows her into a public toilet where he attempts to kiss her. She resists this but unfastens his trousers and fondles his penis. He is aroused (not surprisingly) and wants to make love to her (not surprisingly). She rebuffs him and tells him she will leave if he touches her and orders him to stand still. But meantime she continues her intimate fondling and then commits fellatio.. She vomits when he ejaculates into her mouth.He continues to pursue her in spite of her vitriolic criticism of his piano playing, and he declares his love for her and makes it clear that he wants to make love to her. She again rebuffs him but tells him she will explain in writing what she wants and he must read the letter first. They meet in her house, locking themselves in her bedroom. Mother is disturbed but is helpless to interfere. He tries to make love to her but she insists that he read the letter. It says she has always had a desire to be bound and gagged, and be beaten. She produces the ropes and gag that she has acquired.The boy, who is sexually normal, is shocked and revolted.Need I go on much more?

I'm not telling you to steer away from the film, but be aware that what you're about to see is some disturbing material.  Definitely not a pleasing film to watch, but nothing is put on screen strictly for shock value.  But I must admit, when I watched the film for a second time, I had to skip to the next chapter when the razor blade scene came up.  The main character is one of the most unsympathetic sympathetic characters I can think of, but we start to better realize the humanity of her character later in the film's second act.  In one scene, she stuffs broken glass in one of her student's jacket pocket after being dissatisfied with her apparently unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous when in front of a live audience.  The student goes into her pocket and cries out with pain as she stares at her blood-stained hand.  Next to the razor blade scene, that disturbed me most.  The student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she.  When she gets word that her daughter won't be able to play, she talks about it like she also got also her hand injured, being one of those spoiled mothers who tries to torture her daughter into becoming an overachiever. Though the film intrigued me and caught my interest for the most part, I felt more needed to be explained about Isabelle Huppert's character.  When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porno movies and engaging in that behavior herself, you want to understand the root of the problem.  The movie establishes that she wants desperately to be loved.  Then why the hateful attitude towards everyone?  Why does she receive sexual pleasure from pain? The acting is terrific and I liked the glossy, stylized lighting.  Altogether, it's not a film I'd recommend if you're in the mood to be entertained, but as I said it's very intriguing.

Movies with psychopaths or psychotics as main characters (unless they're really about those who respond to the madness) boil down to portraits of chaos and human depravity which is ubiquitous in our universe.

It turns physical as the pair exchange slaps, and then her mother tearfully relents and guilt trips her into a heartfelt embrace and make-up. We sense that this is a frequent cycle of events in this troubled household. And then slowly, as Haneke always does, the uptight, business-first piano teacher is revealed to be some sort of sexually repressed deviant that seeks solace and expression in BDSM and other sexual kinks. One of the things that this film excels in is visually portraying that carnal lust from our two main characters. One is a middle-aged woman whom is suggested to never have had a normal relationship, while the other is an excited 17 year old boy. In an American film, the lovers would burst through the doors, struggling but somehow never actually removing any of their clothes, and then we would cut to a post-coital scene with the sheets appropriately covering their top halves. Here, they are entwined with such quiet desperation (see the pose on the poster) even as their characters are so at odds with each other. She forbids him from touching her and denies him orgasms, no doubt passing on such a strict manner of obedience from her mother. And he jogs on the spot vigorously and celebrates on his apparent sexual conquest to be, like a 17 year old would. The tragedy then, is in the misunderstanding of the psychological damage that has been done to Erika and its consequences. Walter is uniquely positioned at an age of breaching adulthood and suffice to say that his smile and greeting near the end of the film is supposed to be a pleasant one, but becomes chilling because he has completely misinterpreted the situation. This is a deeply pessimistic film, and I think for once Haneke has missed his mark in attempting to forge this character of Erika. He is forced to rely on these subtly shocking scenes as he often does; the peeing while voyeuristically spying on a couple in a drive-in theatre, the self-mutilation, and the sudden pouncing and sexual longing for the mother that reeks of simplicity and misunderstanding. She is reduced to a delicate sadomasochistic stereotype that so easily wilts over so that we are compliant in being sympathetic with her. It is a pity because Isabelle Huppert's performance deserves much praise. There is a cold, calculated manner in the way she carries herself that puts on such a strong exterior barrier in her persona that makes it so much more effective when we peer into her deeper fantasies. After she is caught in the drive-in, she doesn't scamper away like some red-handed thief, but briskly makes her way out of the area with her head held high like some sort of businesswoman with a busy schedule. The slight embarrassment on Huppert's face sells it. Later, when she catches one of her students looking at porn magazines in a shop (but really it is he catching her), there is that slight embarrassment again, but she acts haughtily and dismissively and quickly pretends to be occupied. She presents herself as the harsh, unsmiling, career-orientated woman while committing such a petty and hurtful act in the background. Haneke shoots these characters in harsh light and washed out palettes even as they are surrounded by beautiful music. His edits link together the steely, unblinking gazes of teacher and student and vice versa, blocking out all other directions. In one instance, he frames Erika at a piano recital, completely surrounded by empty chairs and separated from the others of the group. A conversation with the weeping mother of the wounded child conveys a strong sense of irony when she questions who would be so evil to do such a thing. But this film is not about the lurking of evil below the surface. It is about misunderstanding, and how it gives birth to tragedy.

I've never read the original source material, but through reading a plot summary it seems Mr. Haneke hits a majority of the themes and scenarios represented. Michael Haneke has a certain approach to characters in his movies that I've come to respect a great deal. Aside from shooting his works effortlessly, he has always depicted his characters in a way as to never manipulate the audience, but allow their actions and mannerisms remain open to interpretation for each individual. This allows for less formulaic performances, and a story like The Piano Teacher can benefit greatly with this approach.Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert), is a piano professor at a prestigious music conservatory. Already in her forties, she still lives in an apartment with her domineering mother (Annie Girardot), leading to much frustration between the pair. Eventually Erika meets Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), a 17 year old engineering student and eventually both develop an obsession with each other. Even though she initially tries to sever contact between them, his persistence eventually leads to his discovery of her personal and quite frank voyeurism.For as challenging as the film may get, it never begins to become tedious. Granted for a 2 hour picture the story feels a little stretched, yet it's Haneke's camera work and Huppert's fantastic performance that makes this all so highly engaging and unique. The music is implemented while forged extraordinarily well, and the levels of S&M can become extremely uncomfortable towards the third act, which finally made me realised why so many reviews I've read said it became unpleasant viewing. Regardless, it all leads to a stunning conclusion and I highly recommend this movie. If we can live in a time where fan-fiction like Fifty Shades of Grey sells millions, then The Piano Teacher is in a league of its own and should be praised and held in a much higher regard. Final Verdict Isabelle Huppert made the movie for me. She really transcends what could've been expected, and my predicaments towards the stories conclusion were consistently altered. 9/10.

I immensely admire Haneke 's recent film Amour; a film which would invite the spectators to take journey into the core of the matters and to the dark maze of human soul. It's said that through insanity, humans would sometimes find sanity, truth, love and empathy.I recently watched The White Ribbon and The Piano Teacher. My predication was that these films were somehow prophetic reflections of a new rise of totalitarian era. A suffocating new historical period!Yes, they indeed, are!I found both movies the White Ribbon and The Piano Teacher disturbing. Learning about these violent realities, the audience would need to get away from the harshness and be surrounded by the beauty of nature, serene environment, and splendor dreams. To deal with reality we need dreams! The Piano Teacher reflects the outlook of 80s, 90s and early 2000s where the notion of sexuality was dominant.

Haneke's direct approach of capturing the lead character's life with such excruciating detail gives the viewers a sort of voyeuristic pleasure. That's what makes the film as well as the lead character (Erika) so fascinating.All the three main characters are extremely intriguing; the domineering yet never-satisfied mother, the emotionally and sexually repressed piano teacher (Erika), and the charming and precocious engineering student trying to pursue Erika (Walter). The characters are portrayed brilliantly, especially the one of Erika by the remarkable Isabelle Huppert, who plays the character with such stunning and heartrending honesty.Music also plays an integral role in the film. Erika's fascination with Schubert (who lost his senses in his later years) almost defines her character. Lines from Schubert's 'Winterreisse' quoted and sung in the movie, Dreaming of what they don't have, replenished of good and bad. And the next morning all flown away., resonates so well in the lead character's life.Haneke's direct and unrelenting approach to the material might not be easily accepted by the audiences; only a select group can actually appreciate his terrific feat. This sensitive material, if it were in the wrong hands would have been such a disaster; thanks to Haneke and Hupert, it's not.Ultimately, 'La Pianiste' is a deeply-moving and thought-provoking film.

I for one found it a powerful and sometimes beautiful film. I will admit the first half is better than the second however. The second half does take a nosedive in plausibility particularly a really awkward moment where Erika takes out her sexual frustrations onto her own mother, while the first half is absolutely fascinating. The Piano Teacher is very well made, bleak and somewhat cold in colour palette but at the same time sumptuous. The cinematography is splendid, as is Michael Haneke's sure-handed direction. The music is outstanding, Schubert's music- Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Schoenberg and what sounded like Bach in the two pianos-playing sequence- is the most frequent and it is deliciously lyrical though the repetition of Im Dorfe- the one with the growling-sounding bass line- is likely to haunt your mind. I also have to say the piano playing is amazing, some of the best I have ever heard. The script has its very thoughtful moments in the piano teaching sequences and the letter scene actually is revealing about Erika's sexually frustrated and somewhat warped state of mind. The sex scenes though do have some lines that are likely to make you go um, okay, the worst offender being the penis-related one in the bathroom sex scene.The story is interesting in life as a piano teacher and how the pieces are interpreted and has some genuinely disturbing moments primarily Erika cutting herself, Erika's attack inflicted by Walter and the rape scene. The ending is interpretative and on the abrupt side but was a clever and fitting to end the film. The characters are not easy to empathise with, the main character especially is very cold while Walter is somewhat relateable until his terrifying change in character. The performances are really great. Isabelle Huppert is incredible in a difficult(both in character and how she relates to the audience)role with eyes and delivery that tell a huge amount. Benoit Magimal is a charmer in the first half, and once Walter is repulsed by the letter his change in character does manage to terrify. Annie Giradot is perfect as the stuffy mother figure, and the rest of the cast give good performances if not quite up to the standard set by the three leads.Overall, powerful, beautiful and shocking, not perfect but very effective. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox "}{"Title":"My first 9/10 for a Haneke....","Date":"8 July 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Working chronologically through the Essential Michael Haneke 10 DVD boxed set, The Piano Teacher is the 7th film in that set. It's also about the only one I'd seen before on Film 4 and this time round, it's the first Haneke that I really got into, savoured - and even enjoyed!Haneke only makes films that not only cause ripples, they're more like tidal waves and waver between being irritatingly provoking and genius and often those boundaries oscillate between very narrow margins.For once, Haneke focuses on just one person, an incredibly honest, pained and often humiliating performance from Isabelle Huppert, who is the teacher in question. Completely turning the oft perceived notion that only males can be sexual predators, this immense - and intense - psychological case study is by turns disturbing, superb storytelling and very believable scenarios and behaviour patterns. Long gone, too are Haneke's frequent jarred sequences, this runs fluently and fluidly. The film is also superbly made, this is as far from the grungy, homemade feel of Benny's Video; this is high art, along with lashings of the sadistic and at times, cruel world of the sexually repressed.At over two hours, this is probably Haneke's longest film, but is easily the most compulsive. You simply have to park one's feelings and emotions as it unfolds. Featuring also pornography (as a playing video) and some otherwise very adult orientated material, this could all easily get too much, however unsettling much of it is, I would dare say that any open- minded adult, from pretty well any background would find much in The Piano Teacher - the content is justified by the story and the character.The ending, too, is surprisingly 'satisfying' (you'll see what I mean) for a Haneke, he is usually so open-ended that one often feels a little cheated.I would say that this is Michael Haneke's best film, so far. It's not for everyone, but once immersed, you may find that it's one of the best films of its kind, ever made.

Erika?s father died in an insane asylum and if genetics weren?t enough against her she has dedicated her life to the exacting, unforgiving life of a professional pianist and professor. The brutal discipline and ultimately disappointment when she never achieves virtuosity leaves some heavy psychic scars which she asks would-be student Walter Klemmer to turn into physical scars. The super-confident, tremendously talented, and brutally handsome Klemmer views the ice-cold middle-aged teacher as his own sexual Everest. She responds to his attempts to mount her with sexual games reminiscent of James Spader?s ?The Secretary.? While this may sound like kinky fun to watch, it is anything but. Kohut?s lifetime of self-denial has left her without means of gaining any pleasure from Klemmer other than to torment him with his inability to make her feel anything. It has the least arousing sex-scenes since Ned Beatty taught Burt Reynolds some new tricks in ?Deliverance? or the awful Marquis De Sade biopic ?Quills?. This is a tough sit even by French film standards and can generously be said to appeal to the small subset of filmgoers who are out to have a miserable time.

She meets Walter Kemmler, a young handsome hockey player student, who changes her life and offers her a chance at some pretty repulsive sexuality.

She is obsessed with porn and bondage.  She lives with her domineering mother and manages to live a respectable lifestyle.  Then a young, good looking student comes along who expresses a major interest in her.  She resists at first, but eventually gives in and exposes him to her dark fantasies.  However this only leads to tragic and ponderous results.     At first this may seem like just another excuse for rampant perversion and sexuality.  Yet that is not the case here.  Huppert creates a very fascinating and complex character.  A major part of the film is actually spent examining her relationship with her mother and her students.  We get a very good understanding of her as a teacher and musician.  We see her drive for perfection and the environment that instills this.  We see how this in itself is a sort of perversion that can only create other more severe perversions such as her sexual one.  We also sense how bottled up emotionally she is and how the piano truly is her only form of release.  In fact the film shows a very high level understanding at just how the instrument and musician relate and coexist.  We see that it actually is a sort of deep level, subconscious communication device for not only the player, but also the listener.  Oh by the way that really is Huppert the actress playing the piano.     The sex is not at all exploitive or even titillating.  It is all dark and grimy particularly the sequences in the apartment.  These sex scenes seem to bring out the darkness and angst we see in the face of this character at the start, but cannot quite understand.  The film explores a good understanding of the torment and frustrations of one whose sexual fantasies are very strong and perverse and yet can never really be lived out.  The main message seems to be that there are many people from all walks of life who are out their like this.  Therefore to deny this film or it's subject matter would then be denying the reality.     It is interesting and unique to see a female who is obsessed with porn instead of always just being the male.  Watching her standing at the Adult Bookstore waiting for a booth to open up while a group of slightly amazed and confused men look on is a gem in itself.  It is also interesting and astute to see the adults portrayed as the corrupted ones while the youths are portrayed as those still believing and upholding the ideal.     The one truly lasting image one gets from this film is not the sex nor the piano.  It is the face of the main character.  Haneke shows a good sensitivity for this.  It is a unique face in that it at times seems very plain and middle aged and then at other times seems to have strong hints of youthful beauty.  You literally SEE the tightness and coldness of the character and then at other times a softness.  In one memorably quick moment you even see the look of playfulness and devil may care.  Her face is shown a lot sometimes in extreme close up.  Yet the more they show it the more fascinating it seems to become.     This is without question a high quality character study.  It is a very sad movie with a very haunting quality.  Haneke shows expert handling with long takes and no fear at exposing and showing the ugliness that this material exudes.  Huppert is amazing in a most difficult role.

Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) is a 40-ish single woman, a successful professor of music at the Vienna Conservatory. She still lives with her mother, or maybe I should say her mother lives with her, since Erika is the obvious bread-winner. Anyway, Mom (Annie Girardot) is a domineering woman whose suffocating control of Erika leads the Professor to escape any way she can, including viewing pornography.In addition to her teaching at the Conservatory, Erika gives private lessons to young students, where, she is demanding, angry, and horribly critical. She thinks nothing of breaking the spirits of two of her students (both of whom have more musical talent than I can ever dream). In one particularly disturbing scene, she crushed a wine glass and poured the fragments into the coat pocket of Anna (Anna Schober), a student who could never measure up to her ridiculously high standards. The poor unsuspecting girl, who idolized her instructor, ended up cutting a nerve in her hand.Another student is Walter (Beniot Magimel), a remarkably talented pianist who seems to have more passion for his Erika than his music. Immediately after Anna cuts her hand, the couple start getting it on in the ladies' room at the Conservatory. No doubt the attack turns her on. Their kinky sexual activities continue for some time, with her controlling the relationship.Walter falls in love with his instructor, but she tells him in a letter that she is into masochistic sex, including being blindfolded, tied up, and beaten. She keeps a box of sex toys under her bed and shows him some of them. He is so repulsed by this that he rejects Erika, calling her pathetic and a host of other names. Their roles become reversed at first, he was obsessed with her, following her around like a puppy, letting her dominate and give the orders. But now, she is obsessed, following him around, begging him to dominate her.I think they could have developed some of the relationships better, especially between Erika and Mom. While the script could have been better, the acting was superb. Both Huppert and Magimel won acting awards at the Cannes Film Festival, the most prestigious in the world. One thing I found interesting is that Erika was such an angry woman; she didn't smile once during the entire movie.*SPOILER* At the very end of The Piano Teacher, Erika is to take Anna's place at a recital at the Conservatory. Among the audience are Erika's peers, her mother, Walter, and Anna and her mom, neither of whom have any idea that it was Erika who destroyed Anna's dream of playing piano. Whether out of guilt, pressure, embarrassment, or self-loathing, Erika pulls a knife out of her purse, stabs herself in the shoulder, and walks away into the night. I think the moviegoer is asked to decide why on his/her own.

This movie is anything but warm and fuzzy.  From the second it starts we're already in deep.  Even before we see the opening titles we enter the world of our leading lady, Erika Kohut, played by Isabelle Huppert.  We see her arguing with her eccentric mother, as they play tug-a-war with Kohut's newly bought dress.  We see Kohut pull her mothers hair so bad her mother cries, claiming she has a hole in her head.  After this we are given the opening title sequence, and in between title cards we see hand playing the piano, as we listen to the music, we hear Kohut's voice unabashedly critiquing the students.  From the second the film starts, to its starting ending, this film is intense.  From the very beginning you are drawn in so deep, it's overwhelming, and never once does this let up.  There is not a light hearted moment throughout the film, and if there was I think it would throw the rest of the film off.  We are constantly bombarded with sick fantasies, self mutilation, pornography, hatred, and bitterness.  The tale of Kohut's disturbed state of being, and her search for someone to aid her in it, is riveting.  Kohut finds a man, Walter Klemmer played by Benoit Magimel, who is sexually interested in her, but because of her sadist and masochistic lifestyle, she frightens him.  But like the viewers, Klemmer is in deep.  This film's intensity and frankness (no beating around the bush here) are outstanding, and truly moving.

It's impossible to understand how Nurse Ratched could turn into a battered child without any explanatory material.Erika's constant eulogizing of Schubert hides an unpleasant reality. A great artist turns his pain and torments into art that can be approached without fear by the public. Unlike Erika, Schubert always found ways to communicate with others without losing his sense of self. The song Im Dorfe from Winterreise, which we hear several times in the course of the film, contains much sadness transmuted into lovely sound.I have no desire to see another one of Michael Haneke's films.

Prettily decorated, or maybe contemporarily equipped, with all sorts of shocking scenes played by Isabelle Huppert (who's mostly not a bad actress) with two or three faces. Yes, Erika is frosty and frustrated, but is there actually only one color for that ? Somehow this one-dimensional coldness must be hip in Cannes right now; otherwise I can't understand the laurels the movie received, neither for the film nor its actress.That's unfortunate, because the theme of the movie is very interesting and truly contemporary fed-up Austrians, somehow also a mental corner of Germany's correct, efficient society, cultivate art without being touched by it. Sensitivity, stay outside! This over-ambitious system creates a hysterical mother who pushes her daughter further into this system. There's hardly any place for free emotions, not to mention intimacy or sexuality.But just like in any artwork, there's not only the idea, but also the form the artist choses to portray the idea, which after all perfectly reflects his attitude. And here Haneke's filmstyle is unfortunately just as bold and cold as the society he's trying to portray. There are the additional scenes which can be interpreted this way or that way, which supposedly should make the audience think a little (Haneke), while one is already physically far outside the film by the accumulation of flatly directed scenes. There's the additional emphasis of Klemmer's character that makes the movie hip, but costs the believability of Erika's character, which stays very one-dimensional. Result TrÃ¨s chique. I'm only surprised that so many people don't seem to notice how selfindulgent this film-technique is, thown at the audience just as boldly as Adorno quotes during a Piano recital.

Erika seems a bit single-focused, but the music is beautiful and her intensity seems at first to be appropriate enough. Still, there's a warning in one conversation when she speaks of the last work written by a composer who knew he was going mad. There's a fatal melancholy associated with the undertow of madness for some artists. And her hysterically protective and interfering mother (Annie Giradot) seems close to the edge, too&#151;and it turns out Erika's father has been in a mental hospital for years. The music goes on. Gradually, however, Erika's predilections rise to the surface private self-mutilation, casual and inconsistent verbal cruelty to her piano students, visits to the video peepshow booths, actual peeping at a drive-in movie accompanied by excited urination. And then when a Walter Klemmer (BenoÃ®t Magimel), a handsome young engineer/piano student, pursues her, she at first resists him, and then succumbs, but not as he had hoped she would. She has just filled her timid student's coat pocket with broken glass at the big concert hall&#151;I don't know why, except that Walter was being nice to her&#151;and the girl is badly hurt. Walter follows Erika into a bathroom and kisses her; she calmly makes it clear that she is in charge, and yet she doesn't stick to this dominance. She writes him a letter that changes everything. He wants to love her; she wants him to tie her up and hit her. She can't understand why he's repulsed, and pursues him. Ultimately he comes around one night, locks her mother in her bedroom, hits her, and has violent sex with her on the floor. With her is not quite right&#151;she lies there with a blank look, her mouth twitching slightly. The next day she sees him at the concert hall, happy with other people. She stabs herself in the shoulder and walks away from the hall, bleeding, away from the music, and away from the camera. I think some people have considered this a movie about sexual repression. I don't think so. It's a movie about Erika's descent into madness, which is mediated through sex, but it is more than sexual malaise. It's clear that she has gotten it into her head that ropes and chains are the way things are done, that Walter will want this, and she can't understand why he has rejected her and hurt her. Huppert, again, acts the part of the overstressed, the hysterical, the neurotic, and the borderline madwoman better than anyone, and here she is in her element.

I did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this one falls in the latter category. About one quarter of the way into it I found myself saying out loud, This movie is boring. About half way through I was saying to myself, Where have I seen this before? At the three quarters mark I had figured it out.In spite of its literary origins, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman's much earlier (1969), and better, That Cold Day in the Park. Although the details obviously differ and Altman's work was more plot-driven and less of a character study, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing new to be seen in this production. Every aspect of it has been done before a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant 1992); a perverse and doomed 'love' culminating in an operatic (near) death scene (David Cronenberg's M. Butterfly 1993); uncommonly brutal sex scenes (David Lynch's Blue Velvet 1986); and so on. Hence, I am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking, shattering, etc. This highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable, and clearly succeeded with some. However, I largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film-viewing experience. See enough movies and you really will, eventually, have seen it all. And while it is true that I saw the expurgated 'R-rated' version, I doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of The Piano Teacher.Technically, the film is not without merit. There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent. Isabelle Huppert's creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time. This is the first of Haneke's films that I've seen, and if I were to see more I expect I would have the same opinion of him that I have of Ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be.

Why is the main character the way she is? You won't find out from the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try Bunuel's Belle de Jour.

What does this mean in La Pianiste the spectator is given a crash course in Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis in 131 minutes, averting our concept of Erika from simply sexually cold, or merely fetishistic, to her as active sexed subject. This specifically feminine notion of what is sexual has been termed jouissance by Jacques Lacan - the term is to be contrasted with plasir (pleasure) but rather evokes the subject as proprietor of enjoyment, also attaining the pun jouir (in French to come or orgasm).Erika's task then is to achieve jouissance by means that do not represent in any way the power and signifier of the Father (who is present in his absence - consider the scenes of Erika's aggression towards her Mother). She has to commit herself to self-denial in the form of what Freud called the Death Drive. This often misused and misunderstood term is justified in Lacan's Freudianism as the rejection of the symbolic realm - this meaning the striving for a self that is not in the Paternal world of discourse. In this specific sense Erika rejects penetrative sexual intercourse and embarks in various other forms of enjoyment out of the typical penis centred sexual arrangement.La Pianiste is an example of a theoretically aware film and seems to write its own symptomatic readings for us, which in this way is very significant to academic endeavours in film, though most importantly for the perversity in the cinematic experience, which of late has been somewhat lacking in substance.

When I saw La Pianiste, hoping to land on a movie a little less explicit, I reach the conclusion that Michael Haneke pulls all the rabbits from his pocket, by means of a systematic use of taboo, subliminal and psychological violence. Well, I am personally tired of the punch-in-the-stomach movies that have been continuously appearing for the last years. What it turns out is a mix of bad taste, cruelty and coldness, in a work that can't please me simply because it doesn't have a heart.

She lives with her mother and they involve themselves in a love/hate relationship. As a piano teacher she is a cruel taskmaster. It is obvious that she is sought after despite her almost sadistic vent. When she is not at work she visits a sex shop and watches pornography. She also goes to drive-in movies and peeks into cars at couples having sex. She is likewise, self-abusive. She is not unlike a fascist state in her demeanor. She meets a young, incredibly talented piano student who wants to be in her master class. There is sexual tension here. He begins to lust after her. She is cold but attractive, although at times her very being seems somewhat beyond her years. He really loves her and we know that somehow these two will meet in some way. He plays hockey and there is a kind of male testosterone thing going on. She has a stilted view of sexuality. He has the more traditional view, being on the make and wanting things to be consensual. This movie contains some of the sickest scenes I've seen. There is one scene in a public toilet where things get quite deranged. I have couple more Haneke films to see soon. They are certainly thought provoking.

If so, this would do no more than betray their lack of familiarity with those unusual, but not particularly rare, traits.To be clear; this is not the greatly symbolic film some ill-conceived reviews would have you believe. Instead, it's a fairly straightforward effort about a person with masochistic tendencies. Other than the fact that this person lives with her domineering, wheedling mother, we are told nothing of the life that led her to develop these tendencies, so we are left simply to observe the consequences of her having them. Those consequences range from somewhat interesting, particularly in the first part of the film, to mildly disturbing.The saving grace of the film is Isabelle Huppert's performance as Erika Kohut, ably supported by Annie Girardot as her mother. Unfortunately, the role of Walter Klemmer, unconvincingly written as it is, cannot be saved by BenoÃ®t Magimel and constitutes the film's major defect.If you're looking for some metaphysical profundity about the human condition or a cutting allegory about society, look elsewhere. This is a sometimes clumsy depiction of masochism and particularly of sadism partially, but not wholly redeemed, by some fine acting.

Though the movie is a rendition of a novel but Haneke's instincts as a writer are all over it. Though this doesn't take away anything from his directorial prowess. The Piano teacher like many other Haneke films deals strongly with characters and their emotional turmoils. It deals with how the social domain molds them and makes them more and more objectified.The Piano teacher is very raw but extensible piece of art. This is exactly what Haneke is known for. The ambiguity and layered narrative draws upon multiple conclusions and interpretations. The fascinating thing about such pieces of art I believe is that it doesn't have rights or wrongs, it has your own raw emotional connect. It deals with a very primitive human emotion and builds upon it a provocative drama.Now, the question is do I have an opinion on it. Well YES! but is it important, I think NO. The basics of all the arguments would remain the same while the nuances always have a personal visceral touch to them. Another thing worth mentioning is the performance. Haneke with his continuous takes draws very naturalistic stage like performances. Isabelle Huppert taps into the realism of a very twisted character. Her performance is horrific in the most naturalistic sense and that just makes this movie a difficult watch (in the most captivating way).

While all her students admire her for her incredible talent and experience, they all fear her due to the emotionless harsh critics she launches.

That was it, until a young man, fascinated by her, comes into her life and insists to get to her. This shakes Erika, and therefore, makes her have to step out of her dreadful, but safe routine.This movie is just perfect. Even tough I have no sexual desires like Erika's, I can definitely understand her, why she behaves a certain way, and why she searches certain things. It feels incredibly personal.

In comparison, Michael Haneke's Code Unknown darted off all over the place on one too many-a strand to keep it either particularly interesting nor necessarily be able the work of magic his twisting; turning and brilliant The Piano Teacher most certainly does. Told linearly, and with one central strand upon which the director is able to apply his ability, this love story of sorts, unrequited or otherwise, doubles up as a searing drama refusing to rely on multi-equilibriumed; would-be thematically-bound character pieces utilising a broad number of people, languages and situations to get across a sense of scope and instead zeroes in on a chapter in one young man's life and an even more harrowing one in another older woman's. It is frightening how easy Haneke makes the material he takes on here look; devilish how he works the set premise around hairpin bends and unnerving in its general use of juxtapositions and black comedy.Central to proceedings is Isabelle Huppert's Erika Kohut, an Austrian woman of around forty who works at a Vienna piano school tutoring pupils in the art of playing said instrument. By day, Erika will occupy small rooms in the local piano school shrouded by the grayish ambiance of the Vienna locale, something wonderfully captured by Austrian director of photography Christian Berger in one of the few fleeting moments Haneke permits us an outdoor sequence and room to breath in this stifling film about a series of stifling relationships built on power; control and restriction. On the walls, of which radiate with this disturbing bright glow of white, proudly sit portraits of composers and classical musicians of times gone by in what is the only instance of any sort of decor in the place as they sit there watching on from their alleviated position.In spite of being a bit of a task master, verbally berating students when they make a hash of a note during a symphony and mercilessly striking from the page once with her peers when the time comes to analyse who's hot and who's not those in-between term time, she too exists under a vice-like grip of authority and carefully preordained regimentation when we observe she lives with her mother. In an early scene, we witness Erika return home late at night and take precautions to conceal a revealing top that she has been wearing by hiding it in her bag before she faces that of her lone parent. Aside from these traits, Haneke leaps from both content and a general sense of mise-en-scene to both content and a general sense of mise-en-scene as starkly and as strikingly as sadism is different to masochism &#x96; techniques wholly evident when it's revealed Erika actually has a side to her more inclined to enjoying victimisation and humiliation.This sense of Erika controlling and both being controlled in respective home and work orientated locales is prominent with her dismissing of her pupils but bowing to slight parental demands. What upsets the balance in her life, and comes to form the nucleus of the film's runtime, is a tryst she has with that of a young man named Walter Klemmer; an athletic, somewhat spontaneous and rather gifted piano player himself who's quite brilliantly played by BenoÃ®t Magimel. In Klemmer, workplace and home-set roles for Erika become blurred. The natural procession for the woman to control at school and then be controlled away from it sees her submissive desires become more apparent through Klemmer, whom she only really sees at her workplace, with her controlling characteristics later becoming more evident at home in reaction to her mother's take on what transpires.This sense of shaping up against one another is evident from early on in their relationship, Erika and her mother forcing the young man to take the stairs when they occupy the elevator up to one of the top floors of the piano school thus forcing him into working a sweat as he rises to the challenge of matching their somewhat pseudo-evident demands. When Erika and Klemmer first become acquainted, he ends up rather thoroughly playing a contingency piece without much in the way of aid and his fulfilling of this duty is captured around Erika's own gaze as these characteristics omitted by one of her students pulling through and refusing to be controlled carrying with it an eroticised surge. Where Erika seems to be able, indeed enjoys, controlling and bossing around her one-to-one students in their playing of the piano, a point is made to linger on such an instance before permitting Klemmer entrance to her studio for the first time so that he may play; answer back and match her at her own fortÃ©.The film's crux is in how Klemmer, brought into Erika's world, will react to the odes of bondage and discipline Erika wishes to instill into their already functioning relationship. If Klemmer is a young, athletic, heterosexual Aryan and a somewhat cocksure young male specimen living a familiarised existence of looking for sexual intercourse out of relationships with the opposite sex, what of his attempted applied descent, instigated by that of others, into a generalised realm often shunned or frowned upon by the rest of society conforming to pain and controlled abuse as a means of release? Haneke's hypothesis, on top of the said ideas to do with the two stark existence's the protagonist leads, makes for a supremely rewarding character drama &#x96; it is more focused than that of Code Unknown; more mature than that of Shainberg's Secretary, in which fetishism was essentially introduced as something worth no more than being the continual butt of an indie-spirited joke engaged in by complete kooks, and is most certainly worth one's time.

But, unlike a physical abyss, it's sometimes difficult to determine exactly when our character flaws, our eccentric personalities, our neurotic tendencies, our insecurities, our unsatisfiable sexual needs, our emotional baggage, our social tensions and our accumulated pain will slide us over the edge, into illness. We're in Freudsville, aka Vienna - even though most of the dialogue is in French (English subtitles). They take their music seriously. Their serious music. Schubert (Viennese), Schumann (German). The lives of both these composers were shortened by syphilis, with years of insanity for the latter. Good coaching or teaching, what is it? - mostly constructive bullying. And perfectionist Erika Kohut is tough on the kids who come to the conservatory for her music lessons. She's brutal. It's for their own good - drive the talented hard, and drive the untalented out. But we soon learn that she's not a happy person. The (love-hate?) relationship with her mother (they live together) is too intense. She frequents an establishment that provides private viewing of porn. And she craves self-destructive risk-taking.It's time for Games People Play (yep, the book by Eric Berne). Subconsciously they recognise each other as players Ms White, Mr Black. He's a promising student, half her age, rather too good-looking. But he turns out to be a shallow young male (what did you expect?), a self-centred, over-sexed twerp, conventional, unimaginative. But isn't that what she really wants? - the humiliation of his prissy repulsion, the violence of his bewilderment? From Isabelle Huppert we expect a dazzling performance, and we get it. Perhaps this is a movie about Michael Haneke making movies? Like a piano teacher, the film director has to squeeze a perfect work of art out of performers who may be brilliant - but they'll never be quite brilliant enough. Will a ferocious pursuit of artistic perfection provoke an over-reaction, a perilous emotional backlash? For Erika it does.

But like basically all Michael Haneke movies, it's not for just everyone. It's really a matter of taste, whether you like this movie or not. It's a movie with a very own approach to its heavy story but as far as Michael Haneke movies go, this one is actually still pretty straightforward with its storytelling. It's always simple to follow and the movie mostly lays out everything for you, so you don't have a lot of blanks to fill in for yourself.Still the story itself will be a bit too much for some people to handle. It's really about something awful and disgusting but yet I really can't help myself but to be deeply intrigued by this movie.It's all about the movie its style and the way the story is slowly being told by director Michael Haneke and its actors. It's what makes the movie a great watch, as well as a real intriguing one. The movie and its story probably work out great and intriguing because it is about something unusual and something you are not likely to see being handled often in a movie.It's a story about extreme sexual repression and what happens when someone finally gets together with someone of the opposite sex. Repulst by love and probably also by herself, a 40-something years old piano teacher uses one of her students, that pursues her, to fulfill her odd sadomasochistic fantasies. But how far is he truly willing to go for her and exactly who controls who? You could say that the movie turns into a sexual thriller, that you can't ever really predict. The events are unpredictable as well as all of the characters. It gives the movie, an almost constantly present feeling, of tension.It's a real accomplishment, by both cast and crew, that this movie about some odd and ugly things and characters, still remains such a beautiful and engaging movie to watch. It's simply storytelling and filmmaking at its best, though it's obviously not a movie for just everybody.8/10 http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"for those feed up with conventional romance","Date":"14 January 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I do not know how I felt after watching it.

We have no control over the image, it is a static, ever-diminishing light bereft of colour and piquancy. This is the latent world that Haneke traps the piano teacher within.One would be forgiven for omitting her name. Professor Kohut might as well have been christened with her eventual professional title. Haneke portrays the abstracted piano teacher as a eunuch to her matriarchal mother's commands. She is impotent to question her mother's demands; instead she adorns her mother's choice in apparel, and remains in constant availability but for revelling in a few deviant pleasures. It is no coincidence that the Professor venerates Schumann and his composition 'Fantasie in C Major', written in the onset of his mental decline. She iterates his knowledge that he is no longer in the prime of his youth and contends with the belief that he has a last impetuosity, one last twilight, before he dries up. Yet, perhaps this is the Professor's first. Her battle lies in that she fails to experience; she impassively views life as a set of instructions like the chords of sheet music. When she loves she enforces a written code of practice on her lover, unable to tolerate instinctive displays of affection.Until the virile young Walter Klemmer is computed as a potential target of her perverse desires, the Professor's sexual urges are sated with a shroud between heated passion and her unflinching expressions; whether that be a television screen showing pornography, sniffing the semen on a used tissue, or the car window of a couple in the midst of intercourse. They can lead her to an explosion of gratification, but not punctuated by a typical climax but by a perfunctory body movement. Haneke harnesses her sexual emotion; her face remains unaltered as urinating, choking or vomiting yield the release of her pleasure.The novel of the same title, penned by German author Elfriede Jelinek explores the delivering, loss and consequences of control. There is constant competition for control in Haneke's adaptation as the Professor's one last twilight is unattainable without the subjugation of her mother's imposing will. The Professor's mother has prescribed years of debilitating mechanisms to keep her daughter under the strings of her command. In order to reverse this hegemony the Professor must initiate trivial battles; she purchases a new dress or remains out of reach for an evening, and alongside this incidental jockeying transpires the physical fights, the hair-ripping, slapping and the instruction for Klemmer to act as though her mother was absent &#x96; this an implicit instruction for Klemmer to dispose of her because of her omnipresence in her daughter's life. Watching Haneke can be something like poking a roadkill toad with a stick on your way home from school. It is likely that you were repulsed by the decomposing skin and the visible fractures on the limbs of the toad. Disquieted, you fled. Haneke gives you the chance to roll back your suppression of the disturbing curiosity that lingered days after the event; a curiosity that you haven't acknowledged since. More often than not there will be one moment in a Haneke film that will have you with your head in your hands, murmuring expletives into your sweaty fingers. In that instant your eyes will avert, only to return in the next instant compelled. Haneke reminds us that there is a little of the perverse within us all and neither is it a crime of the sinful.When Mother is sexually assaulted by her middle-aged daughter in the bed that they share, a discombobulated titter rises in your throat. An instant later you are relieved that Haneke has played his hand; this is the worst of the sexual repression and broken social norms that you are going to encounter. Only it's not. A further instant gives you the time to reflect that your hands are still dry and are still contentedly clutching the popcorn; you aren't the slightest bit perturbed. With this realisation comes the perspiring armpits &#x96; you've brought the decaying toad home and with your hands guiltily stained with blood, dirt and other obnoxious fluids you stand before your mother with a beaming propitious smile. How could this not be appropriate? What else is befitting of this overwhelming feeling of pride and discovery. Because when the Professor mounts her elderly mother, smothers her lips with kisses and gropes between her legs you perceive this to be the natural conclusion to their love. After all, Mother impregnates her daughter with the act of sabotage inflicted upon her daughter's supposed rival. Mother and daughter lie in bed next to one another, mother permeating her daughter with soliloquies of malicious intent and these are born with the fertility of youth; the Professor bounds in playful vivacity before maiming her rival.The final scenes are played out with impendency; a threat hangs in the air and in the face of the Professor. Her mother is unusually submissive; the Professor has finally reached the summit of her potency and all the battles combine in one room, but it is she that is the virago standing tall amongst her weaker challengers. She can cut a man down in her prime, she can destroy the hopes of a gifted young disciple; no man or woman can soil her ambition. All but one. The Professor's lingering devotion to the woman that trapped and destroyed her own hopes as a gifted young disciple plagues her like Stockholm syndrome. Instead, she aims to destroy what her mother truly cares about and even this with a powerless indifference. Haneke intends us to feel not the pain of the tearing of skin but of the ungratifying and unfulfilled.Christo Hall - thenewwolf.co.uk "},{"Title":"An emotionally harsh movie","Date":"16 March 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Watching a movie by Haneke you know its nothing to get you in a party mood. La pianiste is a depressing and slow movie which is focusing on the incredibly played main actor Isabelle Huppert in the role of a piano teacher Erika. From the beginning you know something is not quite right with this woman that still lives with her mother (and even sleeps in the same room to fall asleep with her bragging) and goes out on nighly journeys that are quite the opposite to her daily routine life teaching piano and being obsessed with Schubert.We soon learn that she harbors a lot of frustration that is released on her students who not just once leave the lesson crying and sexual tension that she releases on her nighly journeys. But as if her visits in porn cabins sniffing used tissues or watching couples in car cinemas isn't enough soon a young man steps into her otherwise empty life who admires her playing and reveals her disturbing secrets even more.Like many aspects of the movie its uncertain if he really falls in love with her, just admires her talent or seeks to add an older woman to his experience. For my taste he gets too involved for the latter two since the piano teacher reveals a rather odd sexual preference which is hard to watch and even harder to deal with for Walter who gets deeper into her thoughts.Its hard to feel sympathy with Isabelle Hupperts Character Erika at first since she is absolutely cold and in her dealing with Walter annoying. But her dominant/subordinate games like the obscure toilet scene soon show she is a woman who lost her self and tries filling the gap with something she isn't sure of. Ultimately she wants to be loved but is stuck in a sadomasochistic roleplay that leads to terrible consequences when she realizes that its not what she hoped and longed for.Its in these moments when finally her coldness begins to explain and the confused psychology becomes clearer, but never clear. Haneke leaves so much open to the viewer. For example, does she just hurt a female student with shards of glass hidden in her pocket just to eliminate a contester for Walter who showed interest in the girl (her running on he toiled and peeing immediately after points to that since it indicated sexual arousal in another odd scene)... or does she recognize herself in the girl who is driven to become a perfect pianist by her obsessive mother and lose touch with real life and love like her? Is Walter a bad person (many scenes indicate the opposite) and just takes revenge for being played with or does he really try to give in to Erikas kinky wishes as a sign of love? Its hard to say... Erikas uncertain often childlike, then dominant and cold behavior makes Walters actions explainable. How would you react if someone you fell in love with demands what is quite the opposite of love for you. Its heartbreaking seeing Erikas face when Walter reads her letter and starts feeling disgust for her although it is the greatest sign of love and openness Erika could ever give and as the finale indicates will ever give.Maybe Haneke plays his well known game in showing how confused and wrecking human relations can become but takes it to a higher level. In the end both characters have to deal with hard situations and Erika gets broken... or does she break herself? In the end all characters seem both unsympathetic and pitiful.The movie got me but not for the supposedly shocking scenes... by far more gripping is the emotional vacuum and hopelessness that is created by Erikas actions... her final look into the camera with a hint of tears on her cold emotionless face and a disgusted act of self mutilation are shattering. Is she disgusted by herself, by Walter, by her mother and the whole world or by her actions that led to the girl not being able to play the concert.... we don't know and Haneke leaves that door so wide open that many will be angry at the extremely open end. To me these uncertainties were what filled Erika with humanity since they made me as a viewer get thinking and trying to explain. Life is hard and being different, for whatever reasons that led to Erikas sexually and emotionally repressed state, makes it ultimately harder.So don't expect this to be a pure shock-fest... its more than that but like other Haneke Movies its way too stretched and slow.

Being on the verge of madness","Date":"14 December 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The first time I saw a Michael Haneke movie I had to compel myself thru it. It was the seventh continent. But still, the movie was on my 'to get' list for a long time after that. I had difficulty getting my hands on an affordable copy. Why was it so grueling to watch? The qualities that made so many flock to movies - human warmth, excitement, people shedding tears, bloodshed on an epic scale; these are omitted in the Haneke movies I've watched. The characters are not likable. They might be crying. They could be having sex as well. But it is like suddenly having insight in General Walther Model's emotional life. It feels alien. In The Piano Teacher, one is looking for what feels like minutes at merely a door closing, waiting for someone to emerge from it. It is almost like waiting for a reward, for watching this. Haneke, I read, is a courageous man. He does not compromise. He does not pretend. His movies are realistic. And slow moving. Time moves here like a glacier. His movies are like cold breezes from the poles. It must have been the lingering and haunting memory of the seventh continent that made me rent The Piano Teacher, because I've watched Time of the Wolf a while ago and found it a boring movie. The Piano Teacher is an incredibly rewarding movie. It's about a piano teacher, Erika Kohut, in Vienna. She is staying with her mother in a small apartment; in fact, they share a bed. Their relationship is strange; her mother is incredibly possessive, almost jealous. For instance, they get into a fight about Erika buying an expensive dress; it ridiculously gets out of hand (pulling out hair, slapping, etc). Then they made up with the mother remarking, We are a hot blooded-family, this is the way it is. Erika is overall unable to express her emotion. Apparently, that is typical Austrian. Then, a student (Walter Klemmer) starts to pursue her and applies to enter her class, after being blown away by a conversation between them about Schumann's madness; His so called twilight right before he went mad, when he realizes he will soon loose himself completely. She senses that he has a hidden agenda and tries to shun him from entering her class by stating, I feel unable to nurture Mr. Klemmer's virtuosity. He enrolls in her classes, but it become soon really obvious that he is unable to think about anything else than her. Eventually they get involved. This is where the movie gets really shocking. A better word is probably anti social. Ridiculous. I'm only going to comment here that Erika wants to run a pretty tight ship on sexual matters. She will state what when, where and how. It is quite obvious that she is a very repressed woman. Between classes also, she frequents sex shops. Or walks around in a road movie theater, engaging in an act of flagrant voyeurism when encountering a couple making love in their car. Simultaneously, she verbally attacks and manipulates one of her students when she caught him in the sex shop. I've asked myself initially why the scene (Erika damaging one of her insecure students hands by secretly slipping broken glass pieces into her pocket) is in the film, to realize later on that Haneke deliberately try to make Erika not likable. Even Walter gets a bit disgusted at a point when she insist on him tying her up, hitting her, etc. She replies later on that this has always been inside her, the urge to be hit. It seems as if Erika's governing dynamic is extremity; she is fluctuating only between scream and whisper (a quote from the movie about playing Schubert). She appears to be on the twilight of her sanity, like her idol Schumann. When she eventually fell in love with Walter, it is then also the only way forward - to fracturing her mind. It is inevitable because she is completely unable to cope with her own emotion. She gets even more radical The letter she writes him, cannot be explained in sane terms. Walter's defense when he eventually ends up raping her is that you cannot delve in people's inside and then reject them but there was not much that could prepare him for Erika's twisted up inside. Erika's defense is basically, Love is built on banal things.In another director's hands, the film matter at hand could easily have turned this movie into a 'likeable' film, with agreeable characters. It is possible to alienate modern man from emotions, and to make the filmgoers identify with his struggle. It would have been possible to make society 'feels her pain'. But this movie is stripped. It does not want to be liked. It is strong, and clear. The long shots on Erika's face, clarify a lot. It is a clear shot of apocalypse. "},{"Title":"Rich and dark","Date":"31 October 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This film concerns a piano teacher, Erika, her troubled sexual and emotional life, her relationship with her mother and the possibility of a sexual relationship with a student.Erika's untypical behaviour has been attributed to a number of factors-her mother, her demanding profession, Austrian society, Western gender sex roles etc. This film bears repeated viewings as there are clearly complex interactions between all these factors within Erika's psyche.Some scenes are disturbing, yes, but as well as being upsetting for sensitive viewers, these scenes are highly memorable! Haneke is excellent at creating moments which deliver a sort of sustained jump-shock the self-harm scene in which Erika is sitting at the edge of the bath-tub is perhaps the best example. Few people seem to acknowledge that the film can be quite funny. In contrast to the horror and discomfort of scenes depicting Erika's perversions, the stuffiness of her behaviour in a professional context is highly amusing when a student gives a performance lacking in nuance, Erika describes the girl's playing as being laden with middle-class complacency or some such nonsense.In contrast to the minimalism of Hidden, Haneke allows for considerably more incident in this film (although the movie does take its time when a scene demands it). I think this an admirable compromise with the very dense writing of Elfriede Jelinek. In case I haven't made this clear The Piano Teacher is a superb film.

I can think of Last Tango in Paris (1972), the original version of Suddenly Last Summer (1958) and, latterly, Hidden (2005). There are many others, of course, but those three and this one &#150; The Piano Teacher &#150; share a common theme the consequences of suppressed sexuality.This is the bare bones story and plot Erika (Isabelle Huppert) is a professor of music with a gaggle of students who bore her to death, almost. She lives with her mother (Annie Giradot) in a mutually dependent and destructive arrangement but one in which both find masochistic pleasure; there is a perennial power struggle between them, and yet they share the same bed. Students of Freud will no doubt make the most of that. Erika, starved of contact with men, probably as a result of her domineering mother and a weak father, who dies insane (we never see him), puts all her energies into her career as a teacher and deliberately chooses to deny herself sexual contact with men, and instead seeks vicarious pleasure in pornographic pursuits and self-mutilation.Along comes a very handsome and young student, Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is smitten by Erika, his teacher, and sets out to win her over to him and, in his mind, to save her from herself. That sets the stage for a superior psychological study of Erika as a sado-masochistic manipulator who seeks to dominate Walter while also punishing herself as somebody unworthy of sexual satisfaction, never mind love&#133; Those who dislike overtly sexual scenes between consenting adults should avoid this movie; I've no doubt they will offend many. Those scenes, however, are crucial to demonstrate the depth of Erika's neurotic sexuality, her depraved sensibilities, and her desperation at the lengths to which she will go in order to seek sexual fulfillment and, at the same time, self-punishment. To some extent, I think, this story also broadly hints at the injustice of the male hegemony vis-Ã -vis sexual domination, with Erika as a perverted symbol for all women who want to resist that domination.The acting and cinematography are superb. Isabelle Huppert once again tackles a very difficult role with subdued and almost malevolent gusto; it's a credit to her professionalism as an actor. Benoit Magimel is suitably arrogant, confident and domineering while Annie Girardot as The Mother cannot, I think, be faulted. These three carry the story and the movie, no question, but with a good cast of supporting actors. Much of the action take place in a musical conservatory, so there are many long musical scenes with accompanying long takes of the actors simply looking and listening &#150; but not always to the music. And, for classical music fans alone, this film is a treat, with many piano pieces from some of the greatest composers.Freudian to its core, this film will stand unsurpassed, for a long time I think, as a harrowing exposition of love denied with the final shocking scene illustrating the inevitable result. "},{"Title":"Oddly surreal, yet frighteningly down-to-Earth","Date":"21 July 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" This is a difficult film that can be interpreted from a number of angles. It has been suggested that the chilly cynicism of Erika Kohut and her mother is a synecdoche for the cold, casual indifference of family life and obsession with appearances prevalent in Viennese society. I am scarcely in a position to comment on such a claim, but it would make sense.La Pianiste may also be an inquest into the curse that makes a prodigy. Repressed by her authoritative mother, a superficial social atmosphere, and her own insecurities, Erika has channeled all her energy into her beloved musical instrument, and the energy with which she plays is surely fabulous, yet no dose of that piano will ever provide a sufficient outlet for her overburdened sanity. It is for this reason that she becomes a bit... frazzled in her middle age. She plays the piano with a jealous and inhuman passion because her want for any other emotional outlet has, frankly, rendered her inhuman, and this is also why she is incapable of receiving love as a living person. (I'm not overly familiar with Nietzsche, but is this a parody of the Ãbermensch?)Yet, although I seriously doubt this film was intended as an exposÃ©, Erika's behavior rings quite true with my own and my friends' experiences with people in the entertainment and performing arts industries egocentric, vengeful and emotionally unstable. As a matter of fact, one friend had a first-rate voice teacher who apparently kept a knife hidden in her car seat and would always try to coax her best students to ride with her to their venues. (She was later hauled off to jail for sexually molesting a male student.)Well-conceived and well-crafted, even to the point of being almost too plausible to convey its historical or philosophical point. "},{"Title":"Hanekian Brutality","Date":"6 June 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Confrontations with ones emotional hollowness and inability to engage in physical love doesn't get more harrowing than in Haneke's typically masochistic study of incomplete individuality and the facades we publicly offer to assure ourselves of a full life. Despite existing in a world of gorgeous, soulful music that stirs the heart, an instructor finds herself incapable of communicating with the smallest amount of grace and decency in order to assist her frazzled students. Should it be a surprise then, that something more than failure is met when a chance at a meaningful physical connection is offered. Despite veering off in foolish and stagy extremes during its last few minutes, this is a believably inexorable experience. Huppert is perfectly suited, with her severe brow and her uncanny introverted instincts, like Nathalie Baye, to play women who succeed in wringing out every last potentiality of pain in her characters. However, I did disapprove of Magimel's casting as his leering eyes lasciviously undress 'Erika' from the onstart. Klemmer's character should be aware of his uncommon talent, but more oblivious to his own sexiness and charms. Then, his longing for'Erika' and its eventual unraveling would have been doubly heart-renderingly tragic - for him as well as for her.

Isabelle Hupert is masterful in showing a glimpse of these deep interior emotions while at the same time fighting with herself to overcompensate with her demeanor. The story, screenplay and directing is powerful. The classical music is good, but is not overused or central. It is an aspect of the protagonist which she uses to exercise her much needed control (a nice parallel to her overbearing mother's constant need of control).Benoit Magimel is also the right choice to uncover with the viewer the depth of Erika's character. He plays well against Isabelle and switches between love, lust, wonder, shock, affection, repulsion, intrigue, indifference and blind admiration.Michael Haneke makes interesting situations and great film moments. He uses his actors well and his love for the work is apparent. He goes further using sound (or lack thereof) as a powerful element and gets very close with his camera to really get us in the intense, interesting and mostly very human moments. He understands human nature and make us feel, wonder, understand. Jealousy, anger, love, lost, abandon, redemption, failure, self-hurt, all intertwined and expressed in many forms. The characters are all that more believable, flawed, fighting, trying and mostly failing. This is life.The story slowly, but successfully had me riveted and the situations constructed sometimes had me at the edge of my seat by their audacity, creativity and realism. The setup were so strong that the denouement could not live up to it and the scenes anticlimaxed once or twice where the intensity and extremeness could have been explored further. The only other qualm I have is that I found one important scene too static and overly long that could have been changed or edited out. This minor issue in the storytelling is easily forgiven and I am sure the director was trying to pace some deep desperation, confusion, (elation?) yet I found it did not exactly work.All in all a great provocative, thoughtful, memorable film.

THE PIANO TEACHER is no different, and is one of the more solid Haneke films.THE PIANO TEACHER delves into the life of a dry and controlling (you guessed it...) piano teacher. She is very cold in her work with her students and in her daily routines, and lives with her over-bearing mother who tries to control her every move. As the story goes on though - we find that Ms. Uptight-and-Dry piano teacher is also a bit of a freaky-deaky. Seems she likes to go into peep-show booths and sniff used jizz-rags while watching porn loops. Eventually she is pursued by a young and talented pianist and the teacher lets him in on her secret desires to be severely dominated. This puts the young man off, but the two have an attraction that continually brings them together. Eventually the young man gives the teacher exactly the sort of treatment she asked for, but when he does, it doesn't seem to be much to her liking...THE PIANO TEACHER seems to tackle many themes - mainly the sexual power-plays between men and women, but to the highest degree and using extreme sexual fetishes as the measuring-point. Control is passed back and forth between the teacher and student on several occasions, resulting in some harrowing conclusions. Eventually we find that after experiencing the sort of treatment she so yearned for, the teacher may not have really thought through the consequences of her desires - and on the other hand, the young man who initially wanted no parts of her depraved games found himself playing along willingly once he got into it.Haneke's direction is strong and voyeuristic as usual, and has a knack for making the audience uncomfortable - even while showing very little graphically in his films. I find this to be the mark of a truly great director. Though I tend to gravitate towards gory and graphic cinema - Haneke is a director whose works I always seek out and admire for their under-stated shock-value. There are things that I don't particularly love about his films - oftentimes the endings are a bit obscure (as in this film...), but every one of Haneke's films that I've seen (FUNNY GAMES, BENNY'S VIDEO, CACHE, CODE UNKNOWN, THE SEVENTH CONTINENT, and now this one) has been a worthwhile view and has far more positive aspects than negative. THE PIANO TEACHER is definitely a must for fans of Haneke's other works, or those that enjoy bleak and confrontational films...8.5/10 "},{"Title":"Two-sides","Date":"26 January 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Erika is a highly respected piano teacher in a highly respected music school. She is very regimented, but an effective instructor that rightfully earned her respect. However, beneath the surface of this professor at the top of her game is an emotionally repressed and bizarre personality - she still lives with her mother, visits porn shops, and satisfies her sexual desires through voyeurism and masochism. Things take a turn when she meets Walter, a young engineering student, whose hobby is music, at a recital and he becomes increasingly interested with her and her musical ability, and things really take a turn when he learns of her strange life outside of music.The two leads, Isabelle Huppert and Benoit Magimel, are terrific as two people with nearly opposing interests in one another - one wants love, the other someone to help act out strange and even repulsive fantasies - yet the way they are shown coming closer and closer to each other is nearly mesmerizing. Though the story focuses as much on Erika herself as her relationship to Walter with Isabelle Huppert giving a double edged performance showing two vastly different sides to a person. And the whole is paced almost like a work from a great composer - long, but nonetheless fascinating to sit through.

Perhaps the best way to describe it is to call it a hard, raw, uncensored and realistic view on the life of a woman who isn't exactly what you would expect of her if you would meet her for the first time. I know that sounds a bit mysterious, but much will be explained if you read the next paragraph...The movie is about a female piano instructor at a famous music conservatory in Vienna, who is highly respected for her talent and discipline. But she isn't the nicest of people. She's an arrogant ice queen and unforgiving towards her students, but in the meantime she is also very submissive towards her mother, with whom she lives (and sleeps), because she doesn't have a husband or a lover. Because she hasn't got a man in her life she satisfies her sexual appetites by watching extreme porn videos, by voyeurism and masturbation and sometimes even by self-mutilation. When she finds out that one of her students is in love with her, she starts some kind of sexual relationship with him. But she never wants to fully satisfy him until he gives her all control over the relationship. When he finds out that S&M, pain and humiliation are part of her sexual fantasies, he first runs away from her, but soon returns and gives in on her demands. The only thing that I don't really understand is why this movie gets the label adult on this website. Sure, for a few seconds you'll see a part of a porn movie that doesn't leave much to the imagination, but that's a part of this woman's personality and wasn't added just because of the sex. A movie like LucÃ­a y el sexo had a lot more sex in it and that one is called a romantic drama. No, when I think of adult movies, than I think of porn movies, not of movies like this one.As I already said before, this is a hard movie and certainly not for those who are used to watch the average romantic Hollywood film. They will almost certainly not like it, even though the classical music in the soundtrack sometimes makes it all a bit more bearable. Neverthelles, this is an interesting film and to make things short I want to conclude by saying that it isn't perhaps a 'fun' movie to watch, but it is good cinema with some very good acting in it. That's why I give this movie a 7/10, perhaps even a 7.5/10.

Is it a condition of the intellectual to be either completely asexual or so sexually repressed that descent into the darker regions of sexual gratification is the only way to deal with real human behaviour? Maybe. And does the dominating influence of the Mother figure, who in turn has denied her emotional needs to drive her own thwarted ambitions through a talented child, result in such an emotionally crippled adult that there is no amount of love that can reverse the damage? Quite possibly. These themes have been written about and discussed for centuries, films, books and plays have all taken these questions and come up with many variations, from Oedipus to Norman Bates. Hermann Hesse explored the territory in his great novel Steppenwolf, Harry Haller being the very embodiment of the repressed intellectual. In fact, Hesse is a good example of the aesthetic intellectual seemingly devoted to matters of the mind rather than the body. The Glass Bead Game is a fine example of a novel written purely for the intellect, in other words, mind games. But is it satisfying just to feed the mind whilst starving the emotions? Come to that, is it healthy? What happens to creativity when the denial of the emotional is detrimental to the aspirations of the intellectual?You become a piano teacher.Isabelle Huppert gives a frighteningly convincing and ultimately tragic performance as Erika. Yet another foreign actress who can outperform any of Hollywood's empty vessels but is never rewarded or recognised with an Oscar. This is not an easy film to watch at times but it is not meant to be simple entertainment. Definitely not for the squeamish or those who find scenes of strange sexual behaviour upsetting.

One clear consensus is that the film is on characters rather than stories, with a simple plot of an encounter sort, between stern piano teacher Erika (in late thirties according to the material in the official Cannes web site) and student and admirer, infatuated Walter, two roles winning respective awards for Isabelle Huppert and Benoit Maginel.The early part of the film would capture the attention of music lovers, with numerous scenes of Erika's lesson, as well as performances by both Erika and Walter. As one scene after another peel off layers of the music perfectionist and reveals the desperately sexually repressed woman, the severity of audience's reaction vary, in a wide spectrum demonstrated in the IMDb comments. Personally, it's not so much the ritualized sadomasochism that could potentially be between consenting adults, but the absolutely icy violent bent of Erika that is disturbing. Witness the almost nonchalant manner with which she arranges the injury inflicted on her piano student. Can't help shuddering.In addition to the overwhelmingly powerful portray of the main character, there is also a clear sub-text, about dominating mothers, stated unambiguously in not one, but two characters Erika's mother and her timid student's mother.Huppert is superb. From the slightly down turned corner of the her mouth signifying absolute dominance, to the almost non-perceptible softening at Walter's piano performances, to the still inscrutable but vaguely discernible changes of moods in the various encounters with Walter, she has mastered every fiber of this very dark character that takes a tremendous amount of courage to portray. Maginel's task is not as formidable but in so many scenes, the success of Huppert's performance hinges of his rising to the same level to meet her head on, so to speak.Finally, an entirely inconsequential note on Benoit Maginel. While I observed that he has a bit of an Oskar Werner look, particularly when playing the piano, the good wife added that in hockey gears, he bears some resemblance to Wayne Gretzky, Brantford, Ontario born hockey player whom many consider to be the greatest ever in the game.

I am still wondering about this woman's motivations, and wondering when she began to build the terrible wall that sealed her off from what she needed most. She seemed to be hot and cold when she was around other people, either isolating them with her cruelty or she would be falling on the floor, desperate for their contact. The only middle ground (and subsequent peace) was when she was alone and in the cold comfort she built around her perversities. Somebody said that this wasn't about repression, but I disagree. Repression was the root cause of her illness, and it seemed to have started early on. Her only calm became in feeding the secretive perverted habits that developed as a result. She didn't know how else to express her sexuality and my guess is that she never really had with another person. Hence her I've been waiting for you comment to Walter. It really was pretty pathetic and sad, and I couldn't help thinking it was too bad she couldn't have fallen for a masochist instead of a fairly normal guy who wouldn't know what to do with a person like her.Anyways, this movie is a tragedy and a character study at heart.

Things are just about to heat up.Meanwhile, BW starts off with an extreme close-up of Emily Watson (as Bess), with an impish smile and twinkling eyes, being sternly asked--we eventually learn--by the town clergy questions regarding marriage and her preparedness and capacity for it.To such questions, Bess answers with child-like simplicity and straightforwardness.But why the clergy's doubt and hesitation over her entry into a married life, despite her being at a rightful age? The chapters are just about to open up one by one.How did Haneke and Von Trier track the lives of their respective lead characters?As in 'Funny Games' and 'Code Unknown', the Austrian filmmaker's camera in PT is still, lingering and observant, which only serves, ironically, to underscore the deeply-rooted tension in the situation.Thus, when moments of Erika's self-destructive eroticism gradually reveal themselves onscreen (like the genital mutilation in the bathtub, the visit to a male-frequented porn video shop and the look-out for a copulating couple in a drive-in theater), after an initial brush with her outward character of being a dignified and disciplined, but rigid and icy, piano teacher (the kind who can't and won't see her students' potentials), we are simply drawn into savoring a delicate situation wherein man's secret and subconscious urges come to the surface.It's like a graphic demonstration of a Freudian case history, specially if we consider that the film is situated in Vienna, the city where the great psychoanalyst primarily cultivated his field--and which may be one of the instigators of Erika's morbid ailment, what with its high standards on the arts and scientific research, which may really be too much for the woman (not to mention, of course, her troubled relationship with her parents).On the other hand, the Danish director's jittery hand-held camera and Robby Muller's desaturated cinematography, other than being an illustration of what was to become a discernible movement style (as can be seen in 'The Idiots', Vinterberg's 'The Celebration' and Levring's 'The King is Alive', though BW is not included in the Dogma '95 film series), accentuate the precariousness and delicateness of Bess' life, being a child forever trapped in a woman's body, unable to free herself from the encroaching shadows of her parental figures.Thus, her marriage to an oil depot worker (Stellan Skarsgard as Jan) is simply beyond the comprehension of almost everyone in the rigid parish community (and so, the seeming incomprehensiveness of the colors and angles).These people may have every reason to doubt and worry, but what can be more reasonable than the purity and intensity of love that Bess and Jan have for one another? Again, the unadulterated quality of this love is expressed in the desaturated colors (and thus we can see that the framings and photography in BW serve a complex purpose).From what was written above, we can further point out that both PT and BW progress according to the psycho-emotional dynamics of the female protagonists.It is through their actions, feelings and words that refuse to be confined within the limits of convention and normalcy that we follow the films.These films become these characters, in the deepest sense.And as the two audacious and unapologetic auteurs would have it, they'll put their characters (say, the complacent affluent family in Haneke's 'Funny Games' or the beleaguered doctors in Von Trier's 'The Kingdom') in a situation wherein they're inevitably drawn into decisions and actions that are not usually within their normal stock of choices and capabilities.And it is to be particulary noted that, as far as the two women are concerned, such pivotal moments are in the nature of sexuality, which only planted the seeds of their own undoing, self-destructive as it is self-gratifying.For Erika, it's the arrival of the young and handsome Walter (Benoit Magimel), the further provocation of her sadomasochistic perversions (her penultimate act with a sharp knife is of a phallic significance, similar to the brutal conclusion of Breillat's 'Perfect Love');for Bess, it's the paralysis of Jan during a work accident that serves as a basis for performing an unimaginable self-sacrifice, scandalous for the parish community with its tight-locked moral code because of the sexual liberalism that the act evokes.Huppert's character in PT is the most extreme that she has essayed so far in her entire brilliant career (despite similarly provocative roles in 'Coup de Torchon', 'Story of Women', 'Entre Nous', 'Madame Bovary' and 'Un Merci pour le Chocolat'), while Watson's in BW is remarkably complex and intense for an introductory role.Extreme decisions and incredible sacrifices.Such are the dictums in Haneke's and Von Trier's finest cinematic transgressions.

Within the film this is the control that Huppert's Palme d'Or winning Piano Teacher explores as teacher, daughter and lover. Outside, Haeneke's meta-study is are you, the viewer in control - can you just walk out of the theatre? Or am I in control getting you to watch what I put up on the screen?What he puts there is a virtuosically filmed (no cutting, little dollying, documentarianised, no music) sequence of episodes of violence and sadomasochism as the teacher tries to film a true experience of love, music and even pain.Alas the film though, thoughtful and well constructed is simply too cold. Huppert's Teacher is barely human enough for the sympathy needed to engage the viewer. We are self referential as the voyeurs in the theatre, but we do need to engage with a narrative to explore this alongside the teacher in the film as well.If you get to the teacher asking Walter 'Have you read Adorno on Schumann' and think ooh, interesting the get thee fleapitwards.

I was not prepared for what I got, but I suppose I should have been a little suspicious by the fact that the movie is unrated.  Unrated in this case definitely means adult.  The protagonist just kept getting weirder and weirder.  She had so many emotional conflicts that I was exhausted by them long before the end.I have to admire Isabelle Huppert for taking on this difficult role - can you imagine what it was like to film some of those scenes?  However, she is at her best when she is seen sitting quietly listening to music; her facial expressions say more than words.The movie is closely miked.  You pick up every little rustle of clothes, closing of doors, shuffling of feet, and so forth.  I don't know why, but I found this effective.  And time is taken to linger over scenes, allowing you to digest a bit before moving on.                                  The film depicts the complexity of human behavior. You never know what is going on underneath the surface of anybody, even a seemingly cultured and intelligent woman.  Or, maybe, particularly a cultured and intelligent woman.  The movie encourages you not to take people at face value, but probe and observe before forming an opinion (or suggesting that they be committed).

I was not mistaken, but was still taken by how dark and visceral this movie was.  With disturbing scenes of humiliation, beating, vomiting, along with other unglamorized ways of getting it on (or not getting it on.)Hupert plays this piano professor/teacher of a music conservatory in a prim and proper world.  She also lives with her mother, who tries to control her life to the n'th degree.  She true feelings are trapped within her since she could not express it in either world.  The only ways she could channel out all her anger and emotion is through her teaching and her sexual escapades, which are both ruthlessly disturbing bordering on the extremes, when her tug-of-war interlude with a student gets more extreme every time until it goes beyond her control.Hupert's performance is very bold and powerful, and she took a very big risk doing it.  Actresses in the US of her stature usually would just go do safe movies or roles that don't venture into controversial topics.In all, a disturbing movie that will leave a really bad taste in your moth, but one that should not be missed.  True to the Haneke tradition.

Not because it's not amazingly well done - it is, especially Isabelle Huppert in the title role, who rightly won at Cannes. I first fell in love with her in Amateur and I always look forward to new films with her in them.But this movie was grim and difficult to sit through, and I kept waiting for a final redemption of some kind, which never came. It left me depressed and a bit angry at first, though in the long run I like it. SPOILERS BELOW, so if you haven't seen it, watch it first then come back and read this.-----SPOILERS BELOW------SPOILERS BELOW------SPOILERS BELOW------There were signs throughout, of course, like the audition sequence, where an auditioning potential student comes out of the audition room in tears, presumably because she messed up. I remember my musician side being horrified, because music, in my view, should never, EVER be about that. Even when a piece of music is making you cry, it should always be joyful, because in the end that's all that's worth anything in this life.And that, I think, is the central theme of this movie, and what elevates from a merely depressing movie to a great cautionary tale. This hard, disciplined life that the Pianist lived, starting with her insane mother's pressures and progressing into a career that never took off, robbed her of life. The Irony, of course, is the music she plays is so dynamic, it has all the pain and joy and life that she'll never know, and in the name of that music and all it represents, she was denied it.But the human soul being what it is, she still needed an outlet (or is that an input?) and this manifests itself as various perversions, which are revealed slowly, in stages, so that just as we think her depravity can't go lower, we find out the bottom is deeper than that. There's always hope, chances for redemption, which she fails to take, and in the end this movie is a guided tour through a quiet, private hell.And after some reflection, I do like this movie, because it demonstrates what happens when you concentrate too much on the literal interpretation of something and ignore what it actually represents. When Schubert wrote the pieces featured in this movie, he didn't intend them to represent lost chances at greatness or for them to be the focus of hard, repressed lives. He was trying to distill life into sound. And in the end, when Isabelle goes over the edge, we see that it's too late for her - her world has robbed her of everything that made her human, and all that's left is sorrow and self-hatred.

When the film opens she has come home later than expected to the apartment that she shares with her mother (Annie Girardot). Her mother is upset that Erika is so late and demands an explanation, going through Erika's purse when Erika won't say anything except that she was out walking. They have a huge fight and an equally passionate reconciliation where Erika's mother excuses both of them by saying that they have always been hot blooded. And when they go to sleep, we see that they sleep in the same bed. And all this happens before the opening credits.The opening credits are the first example of the interesting use of sound in this film. We see piano lessons being given, but when the credits are intercut, the sound goes away completely and suddenly, only to come back just as suddenly. The other sound-related technique I noticed was very long sound bridges, where the sound continues from one scene many seconds after the visual cut to the next, or vice versa where the sound starts significantly early. Perhaps this disconnection of the audio and the video is because Erika's work (music) and her personal life are so disconnected.I don't want to give too much away, but if you've seen or read anything at all about this film, you know that there is a relationship with a much younger male student. His name is Walter Klemmer (BenoÃ®t Magimel), and he becomes fascinated with her at a recital in a private home where she plays and later he plays. Although he is majoring in engineering (the subtitles initially say low voltage as I recall), he pursues her, wanting to take lessons from her, and more. He is very confident, which is perhaps not a surprise for someone with such diverse talents.This film won a grand jury prize at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, and Huppert and Magimel won the best actress and actor prizes there as well. Of these awards, Huppert's seems the most deserved. She manages to play someone who is generally very reserved and controlled, while somehow subtly hinting at the extreme turmoil below the surface. There are often very long takes of her where there is almost no motion, and yet there are shifts. It's pretty amazing.I saw this film because of the awards, but I knew that it was going to be difficult going, and it was. And in some scenes it went well beyond what I was expecting. In order to avoid spoiling the film I have not told you what the difficult things are, but they are definitely there.

"},{"Title":"Haneke's cinema at its greatest","Date":"1 September 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Michael Haneke's films are always very challenging and important, and he for one would never do films just to entertain and make people feel easy. His films are psychologically powerful and discuss things about media, violence and human psyche in general. His film Funny Games (1997) is among the most disturbing and unique studies on violence in media and as entertainment like Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust (1979) was and is, and it is not a surprise that both these films have been misunderstood by many during the years and that's why people not willing to think in cinema should never watch these films and this kind of difficult cinema and then judge them without valid arguments. Haneke's film La Pianiste (Piano Teacher, 2001) is a study about feelings and thus sexuality, which have suffered during the protagonist's (Isabelle Huppert, the piano teacher) life time not least because of her almost dominating mother who doesn't let her daughter live her own life free and without guarding. There's much more than that as can be expected by Haneke.Erika (Huppert) is a seemingly attractive and balanced female in her middle age, and she has a passion for music, piano music in particular. She teaches piano for her students but that seems not to be enough as she wanted to play in real concerts instead of teaching nearly amateurs. Also, she is very jealous of those who are younger than herself and who have brighter future in music career than she has. She has no husband nor boyfriend, just her mother whom with she shares even her bed with. She has no one to really love, expect the music and her mother, but those don't offer the kind of love a human mind also desires. She has no feelings, as she says herself to one of the characters, Walter (Benoit Magimel), a young piano student she meets and who begins to like Erika very much, but sadly even his thoughts may not be too righteous. This film explores human psyche, which requires some things like love and peace which can be reached from another human being, usually from different sex. Erika is very lonely as her mother seems to have always been, too, and she hasn't lived her life as she should have, and I mean by this that at the point of some 40 year life time, it is not too normal for healthy female to live with her mother/parents because it restricts and doesn't make it possible for human being reaching independence and own private life, which must not be guarded 24 hours a day, like in Erika's case. Erika's mother always asks what she's done and where she's been and also would like to open doors and see what she's doing in the room. It is often depicted in films that most horrific diseases of mind are because of traumatic childhood and Erika's childhood has ended when thought about her age, but her mother still thinks she is her little child and treats her like one.Erika is totally cold person and also makes her students often cry or become very sad by her words. As mentioned, she says at one point that she has no feelings, but after that she refers to her feelings so it is clear, she is VERY desperate for real love, warmth and response for her feelings even though she said that she hasn't got any. Human being has feelings, but when they are mistreated or abused, results may be horrific. The nice boy she meets among her students, Walter, first seems like the man of her life, but unfortunately it soon turns out that he is just a man thinking like man who perhaps only wants Erika's body and sexual satisfaction, which he isn't going to get from Erika too easily. I think Erika's destiny would've been much better if she'd met real loving man whom with she would have lived her life. Then she had had the possibility to finally save her damaged feelings and mind and live her life with healthy mind and normal relationship with her mother.Erika watches also porn and practices very perverse acts of masturbation and satisfaction, which she cannot reach by same methods that most people do. At the scenes depicting hard core sex (in form of videos and magazines), we see again one trademark of Haneke's as camera just witnesses these things and show plenty of information so that we, the viewers, may find ourselves looking carefully those images, too, as they all might go away anytime.. Human mind has a drive for sex and sexual images, and hard core porn industry just feeds the needs of those who cannot get real sex from some reason, and by showing these images (never gratuitous no matter how graphic) Haneke just makes us look to mirror especially when we start to be attracted of the beautiful naked female on the cover etc. We are brutes which have certain instincts and drives and those are active or un-active in the background, and Funny Games is about the last statement in criticizing the sick attraction for violence and violent solutions and their immorality, in films and in real life, too. La Pianiste tells also something about sexes and that how males are sadly to often in more powerful positions than females and it all is underlined in the scene in which Walter says something about how females cannot play with males' sexual satisfaction/needs as it's not possible, and even though the point may not be too clear written in here, you'll understand what I mean by this phrase when you see the film, which involves plenty of female not satisfying male. As I told earlier, I think the last hope for Erika was Walter, but since even he couldn't offer her peace of mind and soul, her self destruction and giving up was the only way. Even music couldn't save her, and it is wonderful to see Huppert's acting abilities in the few scenes in which she is about to smile and/or cry, tears visible, as she hears music or sees something involving it and her passion for it. But since the emotions of hers are so damaged during the years, even this non-carnal love of hers can't save her.The last scene is extremely disturbing and involves the same ultra powerful cinematic element as Hong Kong film maker Billy Tang's endurance test Run and Kill (1993) which has the same power element by Simon Yam as La Pianiste has by Huppert. The face and its expressions. The killing of the little child in Run and Kill is so unbearably horrific because of the head movements and expressions of face of Simon Yam, and the sad, harrowingly disturbing ending of La Pianiste is also so stunning because of Huppert's face, her fantastic acting talent, and her calm presence and the sudden act of terror, which made some viewers cringe in the cinema, very understandably. The power of cinema can be reached by these simple little things and details, and when they're handled by really talented artists (like Haneke), the result can be too much for the most casual viewers as well as even more experienced ones. La Pianiste ends suddenly and leaves the bitter destiny of Erika to viewer's mind long after the viewing, as it all is real and tells about our real world and life, real people.La Pianiste is a film that cannot be appreciated without understanding cinema as an art form which can deliver very important issues and topics and which can also be larger than life. La Pianiste is a film that should be seen by every psychologist and every parent who has heard from his/her child that he or she needs more privacy and peace. The forthcoming images and scenes once the viewing has started are often disturbing, but important and honest, without hiding anything. I cannot find any mistakes or flaws in this again very brilliant film by Haneke, but I think the credits at the beginning are little irritating and not in sync with the piano music played at the background. This little thing definitely doesn't matter in the final rating, as it doesn't overcome at all the huge merits and achievements of this film. 10/10 for Michael Haneke.

Yes, she was sexually frustrated and a control freak but her behaviour in attempting to satiate her desires was very very far fetched.

If you do not wish to know these before viewing, please do not read.Up until the middle of the film, I believed that our protagonist's erotic life and fantasies were understandable for such a repressed and emotionally unbalanced woman.  Her auto-erotic acts, while clearly pressing the edges of healthy behavior, were probably that extreme because she had no ability to approach her sexuality in an honest and mature fashion.  A lack of relationships in which discussing sexuality would be welcome no doubt contributed substantially to this problem.  This was confirmed for me when the student read her letter aloud.  It was a rather trite, stereotypical depiction of S/M, not unlike what many novices want before they really know anything about their desires or how to realistically translate them into action.The rest of the film devolves into a horrid mess of an emotionally troubled woman and her revoltingly juvenile choice of lover.  Their inability to make sense or mutual pleasure out of their respective passions is no surprise given her problems and the age difference, and the understandably naive way in which she went about expressing herself to him.  Anyone who has experienced S/M in real life would know that revealing such desires to a lover is a difficult and sensitive act, and must be handled with extreme care.  The worst thing to do would be to become too attached at that stage, or to try to goad the person into becoming violent, which is what ultimately happens.Our protagonist's actions are not hard to believe, for a troubled novice who has no information or advice to work with.  But I find it disappointing that introducing S/M into a real relationship ends so badly.  I can't think of one film in which this is accomplished in a satisfactory way.  Yet in real life, thousands, if not millions, of people in many countries enjoy S/M without encountering such dramatic problems.  To incorporate it into a love story that ends happily would seem odd, after all, isn't the point of S/M a radical critique of normal sexual relations?  Yet it strikes me as false to see such a hopelessly dysfunctional character portrayed as our sick and perverted would-be kinkster.  I know many kinksters, and they are all human, and thus most have troubles, but none are as disturbed and unlikable as this character.  Perhaps the fact that she suffers alone, without the friendship or guidance of others, makes the difference.

Fewer still would dare to get so close and offer neithercomfort nor redemption but instead, a critique of power and itsunending reign of terror. Michael Haneke has directed this filmwith an everyday eye which is all the more confronting andrevealing for its expression of the dark depths of the mundane.Erika is the piano teacher but she has nothing to give. Herstudents are taught by their parents to love the fear and sadism which she offers them when its emptiness confounds them androbs her of purpose. Beyond the discipline which her craftdemands and a desperate, intense relationship with her mother,Erika seeks out sexual expression vicariously. She has her role inthe world but subverts it gently by venturing like a wolf into thefringes of everday life. She is a voyeur in a world around her whichvalues her talent but not her own person. A society set whichcherishes blindly the musical art of Schumann and Schubertwithout any context but the silent, knowing self-satisfaction ofarrogant appreciation. For them, she is a brilliant pianist andteacher, a dutiful daughter, and a convenient artistic freak raisedas such.Erika is not a victim. Haneke brilliantly enables her life to beexpressed in the minute everyday details which define the societyin which she lives and the prison which holds us all. Erika doesnot evolve so much as become aware of what already binds her.The film conveys a bleak vision but an honest and confronting one.At a recital, Erika is confronted with Walter Klemmer,  a young manwith confidence but a profound lack of experience. His raw talent,physical beauty and warmth inspires in others respect anddevotion, but for Erika he is another bottle sitting on the wall. Hisbeauty and charm are obvious, but she desires him as animaginary self. She wants to possess him on strict terms. She is ateacher, but she doesn't want him as a student. The scene inwhich she tries to reject his application to study under her only tobe overruled by other teachers perfectly represents thepowerlessness she is subjected to and the subtle vengeance shemust eventually wreak. This is not a film about a character finding herself. It is a film aboutpower. Erika may want to be exposed but only in a court of hermaking, in a trial where her guilt can be punished. It seems thatthe annihilation of being controlled in a sadomasochistic sense,emotionally and sexually, being silenced comes naturally to Erika.She knows nothing else, trusts nothing else and is appreciatedfor...When Walter does become Erika's imaginary self , she can seethe horror of these power relations. She sees the heart ofdarkness but in the end, so does Walter.  Except in a world of men,power and class, Erika is revealed to be a prophet of the mostdamning kind.

Some are simply entertainments, many are trivial, but there are a few I've found to be extraordinarily powerful.  Always with those few, it's been the actors inside their characters that have deeply touched me.  Actors are the greatest special effect.  Frequently, it's been a well-acted characterization of an ordinary person that has impressed me (e.g. Brenda Blethyn's Cynthia in Secrets and Lies).  Sometimes, the character has a personality unlike anyone I've ever known.  Always, though, the actors have instilled in me a far deeper understanding and empathy than I'd ever have in my own life for individuals such as these.  My very humanity has been enlarged.That is the case with Isabelle Huppert's performance as The Piano Teacher.  Since the film makes a good point about the possibility of not knowing what might lurk below the surface of a friend or relative's persona, I can't be certain that I've never met somebody like Erika Kohut.  I can say that I thought I'd never comprehend how someone could be masochistic, enjoy pain and desire humiliation.  After witnessing Huppert's performance, I've begun to understand.The amazement aroused in me by great acting is one treasured response to the art.  A larger heart is another.  This film has flaws, to be sure.  It isn't fun.  It is riveting, though, if you admire the power of transcendent acting.  If your mind and heart are irreversibly closed to sympathy for people unlike yourself, forget about seeing this movie.  Otherwise, be brave, go and you'll be unforgettably rewarded.

Please approach this film with a very opened mind, because otherwise you'll just be wasting your time.  I'm not a big fan of recent French movies nor will I pretend to know much about European cinema nowadays, but from this lamen's point of view there here are a few words to sum up the experience of watching this film shocking, heart-wrenching, frustrating, complicated and dementedly intense. The acting was amazing, better than most stuff out there.  The characters are highly complex and demented individuals and the actors understand how to play these roles.  The script is nothing short of amazing. The way the film is shot is a feast to the eyes, despite its simplicity and understated tones. There are some scenes in the movie that are extremely difficult to watch and mind-blowing.  It's definitely not something for the faint-hearted, that's for sure. Above everything else, this is the rare film that keeps you glued to your seat, even after the credits have stopped rolling and the lights have come back on again in the theatre.  It's the kind of film that will leave you with questions about yourself and will give you another perspective on the average Joe living life in today's world.

The Piano Teacher is not exactly a pleasant film. If you appreciate Huppert's brilliant acting, and is willing to sit through a psychological drama, then go for it. In spite of the film title, do not expect revelry in wonderful piano playing or performances as the drama can overpower instead. There are explicit and explicitly implied sexual content - definitely for mature audience.Isabelle Huppert delivered une rÃ©alisation formidable in her portrayal of an emotionally complex piano professor, devoid of self-loving, desperately needing to be loved yet contradictorily denying herself so. You might say this is an extreme case of motherly nurture in a daughter's piano talent gone perversely bad. Huppert's piano professor Kohut is haunted by her ever-demanding mother (Annie Girardot) who continually treating her daughter 'like a baby', blindly wishing her to succeed beyond being a well-recognized piano teacher at the conservatory.This piano professor may once before enjoyed piano playing and Schubert or Schumann, but her mother's unrelenting pressure on her piano talent backfires. Kohut suppresses her own desires, exhaustingly keeping up a front with her mother, whom she still lives with in the same apartment, has dinner at the same table, sleeps in a bed next to her in the same room. She has not been able to get out of her mother's influence. Constantly she makes excuses to stay out late to be away from mother. Secretly she pursues her own unfulfilled desires for sexual satisfaction. Her chronic desperation and pathetic loneliness are plain for us to see. This could explain the pent up motive to the unsuspecting action which we get to watch her ponderously arrived at and methodically executed. Jealousy is obvious, but from a perverse view, she could very well feel there's no other choice but to 'help' end (her student) Anna's agony from her pushy nagging mother, and in turn, rid of reminding herself similar joyless existence. This film is hard medicine - a journey uneasy to swallow. Appreciating Huppert's performance might palliate un peu. BenoÃ®t Magimel gave a matching complementary portrayal of Walter Klemmer, the young man who desires and expresses his love for professor Kohut. He became the slim chance for her to manifest the suppressed desperation. Can perverse longings be manifestations of love with passion thrown in the mix? What becomes of the players involved? La Pianiste is reminiscent of the many shades of Huppert bleak loneliness in The Lacemaker 1977, steady fortitude in The Story of Women 1988, artless treachery in Violette 1978. I'd like to imagine a hopeful ending she is once and for all getting away from her mother, starting her life afresh somewhere else, doing something else other than piano teaching. Romantically (why ever not) 'd like to think she can start a life with Klemmer, who does appear to love her and knows how to appreciate and reciprocate love, that he might patiently teach and rejuvenate her in the sharing of love and tenderness. This is beyond The School of Flesh 1998, which would seem superficial compared to the intensity of writer-director Michael Haneke's The Piano Teacher. For a lighter note with Annie Girardot pairing with Philippe Noiret, try director Philippe De Broca's Dear Detective 1977. Huppert also has a film with Noiret in director Bertrand Tavernier's Coup de Torchon 1981, aka Clean Slate.

It is disturbing, and intentionally so.  We squirm in our seats as we watch the bizarre sexual machinations of Erika, played with extraordinary virtuosity by Isabelle Huppert.  She is sadistic (psychologically and physically), masochistic (psychologically and physically), and emotionally dependent; she is also, quite frankly, a monster, but is made three dimensional and even somewhat sympathetic by Ms. Huppert's highly nuanced performance.This film is NOT for everyone, and people should be warned that there are several very graphic scenes involving sex, sexual violence and other things some will find legitimately offensive. None of this is gratuitous, however, or simply for titillation's sake as is often the case in Hollywood fare. The French once again demonstrate their cinematic maturity with realistic portrayals of romantic relationships, and their frequent use of ambiguous endings.The Piano Teacher is a well crafted portrait of deviance run amok, and something of a cautionary tale on the possible consequences of deviant sexual behavior.

Privately, she seethes with violence and frustration, and her sexual life is solitary and perverse.  She lives with her overbearing mother, who obsessively drives her to become noticed (and so advance in life) as a talented pianist.  The key to the characters of both mother and daughter is 'obsession.'  These characters cannot change their impulses anymore than a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death.The piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who from the beginning is attracted to her.  They start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the outset she makes perverse and violent terms that he must perform on her, which sickens him enough to want to terminate the relationship before it has really begun.The film ties itself to the female lead.  Isabelle Huppert amazes with a brutal, completely convincing performance as the piano teacher.   She cleverly shows a woman who is drawn to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her perverted impulses.  As a film that is so character driven, you know it would not work half as well, had she acted poorly.This is powerful, intelligently acted, and intelligently and sensitively adapted from the novel.  The camera work also suits the film.  There are what I can only think to call, framing shots where the director holds a scene and forces the eye to dart about.  This is done extremely effectively against a blank bathroom wall, and is a further testament to the director's mastery.Expect to be disturbed and sickened by this film.

Being only vaguely familiar with the films context, I will admit that I was initially shocked by many of the scenes. But in hindsight when I evaluated how I viewed the film I realised that non where deliberately provocative, and all bar one where shot so as to keep the detail off-screen. The protagonist is a middle aged woman, who from the opening scene is clearly still trapped in the role of a teenager and most likely still a virgin. Her only contact with sex is through explicit hard core porn films, which she watches probably out of habit and the odd spot of voyeurism. This has left her with unhealthy assumptions about sex, a point which I found key to understanding the film. Being that she was never able to develop normally due to her overbearing mother she has had to learn the facts of life from degrading porn films, which also act as her only release. So she internalised the idea that to enjoy sex you must be degraded, though in the penultimate scene she realises this is false when she eventually gets a taste of the rough stuff. Other scenes in the film which to me seemed to portray the heroine as a deluded teenager, was the mutilation in the bathroom, the petty attack on a student and the end. The mutilation, a scene which I found initally quite distressing proved that to some extent she was afraid of her sex and had a desire for stronger control over her body. But it is also similar to the habits of many teenage girls, the ritual of cutting (usually on the arms) to release tension is not an activity of sadism but confusion, and while the prospect may seem sickening I think the character would of minimized the pain through precision and practice, gaining satisfaction only from the display she viewed in the mirror. The finale showed the character at her most childishly melodramatic, she attempts to commit suicide by stabbing herself in the heart (in a similar style to grand opera), but makes only a minor flesh wound. She doesn't realise how hard some things are (like love), and so she gets no reward. Her life is defined by practice routine and precision, she is not an artist as she is unable to cope with anything she cannot easily define. Though the film was not without its flaws. Chiefly the lack of development of all the other characters. How much did the mothers behaviour influence her daughter? What motivated the 'boyfriends' attraction to the protaganist, purely admiration? I found these unresolved issues an annoyance but they did not inhibit me from appreciating the complexity of the central character. Overall I would say that it is a film which needs patience and a little time for reflection. If I where to view it again I doubt I'd call it a masterpiece.

He shows us -in real time- humiliation, but there really is not so much just shocking oder entertaining shocking left for us. We receive some possible history of one person, and so it goes more into a kind of depth than the old Haneke films do. This story is bitter and it stays this way.

We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and get introduced to her world. She is single, struggling to find her space against an over-protective and borderline tyrannic mother. We understand that she has lost or has seldom experienced love as a physical+emotional chemistry she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, releases her sexual tensions in sex-shops, as a voyeur, or in sadistic self-mutilations ... This first half is very clinical and builds an incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable.Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played superbly by Benoit Magimel). Though he gets to feel Erika's coldness in the beginning, he seduces her and slowly wreaks Erika's fortress. He loves her deeply but she needs him to fulfil her sadistic desires. Then when she is about to fall for him, he is disgusted by her world and in the end we discover that Erika is unable to love or feel at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as someone impossible not to love). This is the second half of the film, very touching as we see Erika's inability/inexperience to love lead her to self-destruction. This second half seemed less mastered by Haneke, and sometimes had non-credible (ie. too shocking) scenes which paradoxically lessened the drama.Of course, this is a crude film at least in the French version you see porn sequences from the sex shop, daring mutilation and sex scenes. The much talked-about fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was quite good I thought, and is central to understand Erika's sick relation to love. As to the actors, Huppert is marvelous all through the film, Magimel gets better and better up to perfection, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent.

The original French title of this film was La Pianiste which literally means The Pianist, as does Jelinek's title Die Klavierspielerin. This title was not, however, used in English, doubtless to avoid confusion with Roman Polanski's film of that name. The main character is Erika Kohut, a professional pianist and a piano professor at a Vienna music conservatory. Outwardly Erika is a reserved, repressed and puritanical individual. Although she is already in her forties she still lives at home with her elderly, domineering mother; the two even share the same bed. We never see Erika's g father but learn that he is incarcerated in a psychiatric asylum. There is, however, a hidden side to her personality, first revealed when we see her acting as a Peeping Tom, spying on courting couples at a drive-in cinema. More of this hidden side is revealed when Erika begins a sexual relationship with a good-looking young pupil, Walter Klemmer. Although Walter is physically attracted to his teacher, he is repelled by her sadomasochistic tendencies, which leads to a curious love-hate relationship growing up between them. Erika's speciality as a pianist is Schumann and Schubert; Schubert's music plays a particularly important part in the film. This struck me as very appropriate, as his music has always struck me, like that of Mozart, as being full of emotion but hiding it behind a veil of reserve, in contrast to the much more openly emotional and Romantic music of slightly later composers such as Berlioz, Liszt and Wagner. I felt, however, that the film rather pandered to the Hollywood myth of Schubert as a shy, ugly little man who poured into his music all the emotions he could not express in life; in reality he seems to have been a successful womaniser, even though he was far from handsome. Isabelle Huppert is often compelling, and Annie Girardot is also good as Erika's witch-like mother, but this is not a film I cared for. In what is supposedly a character study far too much is left unexplained, such as the incident in which Erika deliberately injures one of her female students by putting broken glass in her coat pocket. In the violent sexual encounters between Erika and Walter it is never made clear whether he is abusing her or merely pandering to her masochistic tendencies. Haneke (who acted as scriptwriter as well as director) might think that this distinction does not matter, but I felt that it was very relevant to an understanding of Erika's character. The Piano Teacher seems to have been intended as a dark, disturbing psychological study, but I found that it did not do much to explain Erika's behaviour except in terms of that old get-out sexual repression; there are doubtless many people who are sexually repressed, but most of them do not behave in the same way as Erika, who appears to be verging on the criminally insane. The Piano Teacher may be dark and disturbing, but it disturbs us to no good purpose and hides little of substance beneath its darkness. Having been greatly impressed by Haneke's more recent The White Ribbon, I was very disappointed by this film. 4/10 "},{"Title":"Let's take a high road...","Date":"30 March 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" possibly a spoiler (an extreme view, like the movie) the 99.99% of human history belongs to the Stone Age.

The severity she applies herself to her professional life is evident in the expectations of herself and that of her students. The contextual existence impacts her as a woman. Between caring for a domineering mother and her busy schedule as a professor of music and occasional recital pianist, she is without a lover or husband. Her sense of perfectionism is shaped by her discipline needed to be at the top of her professional life. However gifted and normal Erica appears during the day, at night she is perverse and bent in her views towards sexuality. She indulges herself frequently with peep shows, mutilates herself during masturbation, with voyeuristic and s&m sexual tendencies. One day at a recital at a wealthy benefactor's home, she meets the talented young handsome pianist Walter. Walter, an engineer student, exudes confidence and talent while performing a piece of music that Erica loves and sought to perfect in her career that of Robert Schumann of the 19th century's Romantic period. Walter woos her with his natural charisma and his forwardness despite being her pupil and her icy resistance. Upon consummation, he discovers her sexual perversion. The couple hits a detour. She forces him to comply her ways without compromise. Despite Walter's disgust and hesitation, he eventually gives into her perversion because of his love for her. However, like a classic tragedy, Walter overcomes her powers and leaves her.AnalysisAs part of the special feature, Isabelle Huppert discusses the central themes of the film she tried to illustrate. She had envisioned a woman enraptured by her own ambitions and idealism of love. She wants a perfect lover. A lover that is completely under her power yet be strong and independent. Isabelle spoke of fragility of being a woman, that somehow she needs to exhibit almost masculine like facade to control and keep things orderly. The demands of her professional life and domestic life has repressed the character to the point she wasn't able to develop emotional skills needed to nurture a loving healthy relationship. When the character Erica meets Walter, Huppert explained she wanted to portray a woman who did not want to be seduced. She felt seduction gives power to the man. A woman becomes weak when she is in love. Huppert wants to portray Erica wanting to maintain her power and absolute control. Erica follows her premeditation by not satisfying Walter at their first sexual encounter. Her behaviour towards him in their relationship is hateful, sadistic, cold and false. Yet in a way she wanted a warm gentle person to love her unconditionally that of a perfect lover who should please her in her perverse s&m sexual ways. Her inability to compromise led Walter to become increasingly frustrated and eventually fall out of love. My TakeThe film is a heavy weight. As it gets to the core of the matter why relationships fail. For me this film uses Erica's extreme sexual perversion to illustrate and expedite how people are sometimes fixated on their own goals that blind sight them from more important aspects of keeping or fostering a relationship. What could have be an ideal pairing of two compassionate and like minded people, in the case of Walter and Erica, is broken by the pair's inability to reconcile their differences. The fundamental cause of failure in any relationships is when one person places one's ego, freedom, and ideals without compromise over the relationship. It's the all or nothing attitude that breaks.

It is when Erica meets the dashing Walter Klemmer that her personal demons begin to dominate every aspect of her life&#x97;the quiet, disguised shame with which she handles their relationship soon gives way to an explosive finale that forces her to cope the only way she knows how...The Piano Teacher can best be described as a story of emotional anguish rife with some very uncomfortable and intense character study. Based upon Elfriede Jelinek's novel of the same name, Michael Haneke's film is one of the finest&#x97;not to mention, one of the most faithful&#x97;adaptations of a book I have ever seen. The novel itself was an extremely controversial depiction of a woman lost and Haneke crafts a startingly effective film, one that not only captures the feel of a book both praised and reviled for its stark treatment of some very polarising subject matter, but even goes so far as to improve upon something that was fantastic on its own to begin with! What we have here is not the archetype of the European art picture, but a story that can be told in only one way possible&#x97;with the necessary detachment.Haneke has often been criticised for his cold direction, but something I have always noticed and appreciated is the way all of his projects benefit from this detached style. The family depicted in The Seventh Continent lives in a home as lonesome and barren as the harsh world they wish to escape, the title character of Benny's Video sleeps in a bedroom as sullen, forbidding and dangerous as his steeply slipping mental state, and Erica Kohut's pain is a pain only she can understand, and only she can articulate, awaiting the interference she craves while she's on her last legs emotionally and mentally speaking. Therefore, it makes sense to have Erica reside in a world as cold and as formal and as dark and mistrusting as she forces herself to be, concealing her suffering in the only way she knows how by laying down the law&#x97;viciously!&#x97;on students she constantly belittles. Erica's home conceals anguish beneath the proper, sophisticated interior decor, and the conservatory where she teaches is a mask to hide the sexual perversions she regards as casually as the way she plays her piano.While it would be simple to classify Erica as a deranged, repulsive bitch of a woman, it is the portrait of silent, budding tragedy beneath her exterior that attracts aspiring concert pianist Klemmer, whom she sees as the window to emotional transcendence and sexual liberation that is deeply lacking in her home. Erica's mother (the gravely-voiced Anne Girardot in a Caesar Award-winning performance) is a manipulative, calculating shrew whose every intention is to keep her daughter mired at home at all costs, simultaneously urging her to taste independence while tugging her back every moment Erica senses salvation at the tip of her fingers. It is the relationship Erica has with her mother as well as Klemmer's spurning of her that drives her over the brink into pure, unadulterated madness, but beneath the madness, beneath the repulsive, shocking, seemingly untouchable personality is a woman who has tasted nothing but scorn every day of her life. Erica's thirst for happiness consumes her to the point that she finds herself unable to cope with the all too real extent of her mental breakdown and finds herself with a dilemma both horrifying and heartbreaking.Isabelle Huppert has to be commended for delivering one of the most fearless, engrossing performances to come out of cinema of the last ten years. It is her work here that perhaps earned her a rank among a list of my favourite actresses and it is her work here that defines The Piano Teacher as essential Haneke, perhaps the most ambitious and startling of all of his other works. Benoit Magimel too, is flawless as the well-intentioned Walter Klemmer and Anne Girardot is fantastic as Erica's wicked gorgon of a parent. The rest of the cast turns in fantastic work, but this is Huppert's film, and she owns every single bit of it with the apparent, jaw-dropping ease with which her contemporary, Isabelle Adjani commanded the screens in Zulawski's Possession twenty years prior.I cannot say that The Piano Teacher is a film for everyone, but I can definitely advocate it as a film that should be seen, if anything for its brutal honesty and clarity of the type of person our society demonises without taking the time to study the actions that define the reactions we, the unsuspecting public, view with our naked eyes. It is for its commitment to truth that I admire The Piano Teacher&#x97;uncompromisingly dark, twisted and always divisive&#x97;as any Haneke film!&#x97;it is, nonetheless, a favourite of mine, and a classic in every respect.

Fairly serious use of classical music (although the use of the scherzo of the Schubert A major sonata as Walter's tool to impress Erika was a risible choice - a relatively light movement, and the performance of the Schubert trio was really lackluster). Lots of good things...But I have to mourn the death of the radical artist I thought (after seeing Funny Games) Haneke had the possibility of becoming. He chose instead to participate in the dissemination of one of the most exhausted tropes of world cinema stylish perversion. Funny Games seemed to be a critique of Austrian society (and, by extension, society in general) from within the manners, the politeness, the superciliousness, the culture, the unostentatious ostentatiousness. It was brutal and unsentimental. This film is the grown-up version, ready for the feuilletons and the coffee - table discussions what is masochism, really?

When I saw The Piano Teacher I felt a strange sense of passion rise inside... A burning desire, to control and to be controlled, to drown in passion... to be seduced. At the same time, I felt slightly nauseated by my reaction that seemed not to correspond with that of Erika. The actress, Isabel Hupper, said that Erika doesn't be seduced, she wants to be loved. Sure, I would want to be loved, but who could resist... such a seduction? By such a handsome, confident, and a little rough-- young man? There are three critical scenes where the power play between Erika and Walter goes back and forth. They are each very seductive and sensual in its own right. The first, when Walter goes to the bathroom and kisses Erika, is really a scene of such tension and anticipation-- the freshness of the first kiss, the urge to feel one another and the sense of -- fearful self-restraint, it's all overwhelming. It is one where Erika dominates, and succeeds. The second scene-- when Erika goes to see Walter in the ice skating link, is stunningly beautiful. I think this is the most satisfying one out of the three; despite the pitiful state in which Erika walks out... she is so vulnerable, walking while almost falling in her high heels on ice... but she is able to conquer Walter in some way. They share their expressions of love, he makes love to her and even though she vomits there is a strange tie between vomit and purity-- she feels pure inside because now he is with her... and he is part of what she always wanted, for him to tell her that she's his little love but command her as he wishes. Power is somehow shared between the two. It seems as if they are on a equal footing; Erika has conquered Walter and he has conquered her. There is a sense of misery as well as victory. The third scene, when Walter comes to Erika's house and he hits her and rapes her, is such an ironic, but very erotic in a violent way. Walter is finally unable to control himself-- he finds himself tormented by ardent desires for Erika. He hits her on the face and tells her, isn't this what she wanted? Erika says no, but somewhere in my mind I kept saying yes... she did want it, she wanted pain and feverish desire-- and in a way she gains it. The rape scene is full of tension and pitiful tag-of-war of control and passion, as Walter kissed Erika's mouth full of blood and comes inside her, who is motionless. The power has shifted to Walter. He now physically controls her, dominates her. Erika had asked for it-- but, he never really is able to conquer her emotionally, which leaves a sense of futility and dissatisfaction. From a different perspective, Erika has succeeded in controlling Walter&#151;-in figurative sense. When he says that he has been masturbating under her window, that is the clearest statement that Erika really has taken over, she has control of Walter's mind. He cannot resist thinking about her, he cannot leave her alone and he feels the urge to have her, he must possess her. During the rape scene, I couldn't help but ask myself, why is she not responding to this? Why is she acting like a corpse? Because&#133; in a way this is really what Erika wanted. After watching the interview of Isabelle Huppert it made a little more sense, but I still couldn't entirely agree. She says that Erika wanted to be loved and not seduced; and she realizes that she would never be really loved. There is a schism between her fantasy and reality. Perhaps. But all that is full of contradiction, Walter denies several times that he loves her, but at other times he swears that he does. In passion there is an element of love, and one can never entirely separate the two. In violence there is a sense of joy, there is pleasure. Reality and fantasy mix. So to me the movie is not only about a failed fantasy. It is more about a fantasy that crystallized, although in a chaotic, disorganized form. In her silence there is a defiance, in his act there is a sense of desperation. In her death there is a sense of emptiness, but also victory; in her taking control of her own life it ensures revenge to the young man who thought he had won. It isn't a true defeat, although it leaves a sense of sadness. At the end she still controls herself and his mind. Walter's obsession for Erika, undoubtedly, would continue to expand because of it.It's a movie that won't let go, just as Erika's presence would never let go of Walter. I believe that she would stay with him forever, like a fever inside his mind-- even if he might pretend otherwise.

Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself. Her outward expression projects her desire. That is why she can hurt without guilt or remorse.Along comes talented, charming, handsome young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity. He wants to become her student so as to be close to her. She rejects him out of hand, but because of his talent the Vienna conservatory votes him in. He falls in love with her. Again she pushes him away, but he will not take no for an answer, and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect.The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? The sadist or the masochist? Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist? It is hard to tell. Is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically, who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment, or is it the person who is rushing out the door, sated, giving the order that no one is to know what happened.But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. She is a sex extreme freak. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability. Actually that isn't even true. She says she doesn't care what others think. She doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love. Love, she calls it. For her sex and love are one and the same.At one point Walter tells her that love isn't everything. How ironic such a superfluity is to her. How gratuitous the comment.The movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified (as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find Erika within). He also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another. This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika, like a blood-drained corpse caught in stark white and black light, lies under her lover, rigid as stone. Here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery. We don't need to see any more.The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; indeed she excels in them. I have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul. Like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What matters to her is the performance and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No character too depraved. It's as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity, and wants us to watch her as she does. She is always fascinating and nearly flawless. She is not merely a leading light of the French cinema; she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of work.I think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker (La DentelliÃ¨re) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. There she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian apprentice hairdresser. Her character was shy about sex and modest--just an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician. Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shameless and entirely depraved.Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets. (Hollywood could never make a movie like this.) In the American cinema, only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty. Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range, but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La CÃ©rÃ©monie (1995) in which she plays a vile, spiteful murderess.Do see this for Isabelle Huppert. You won't forget her or the character she brings to life.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

Die Klavierspielerin is also a personal settlement of her life with her mother. Jelinek herself studied at a Conservatory in Vienna. Later works of her are more an indictment of the suffocation of life in Austria, a common element in Austrian post-war culture as the country has never come to grips with its troubling past.In the movie less emphasis is paid to the relationship with the mother and so the source of Erika's behavior remains largely unexplained here. Erika's father dies and mother and daughter show no emotion at all. In the beginning there is a short fight between mother and daughter about control the mother has on her life. The TV is always on, thereby explaining that mother and daughter don't live life to the fullest at all. Later on she sleeps in one bed with her mother; her mother suddenly starts to warn her for failure if not performing at her best, a theme often to be found in Jewish culture. Huppert is apt for this role and some years earlier did another movie where Jelinek did part of the writing (Malina).The glass-breaking scene has a double meaning. Not only does Erica want to punish Walter for his attention to and interest in another student, she also sees a reflection in that girl's mother of her own mother; in a way she wants to help her preventing having the same life as her with no personal choices of her own.By entering into the relationship with Walter, a classic male/female struggle starts. Although women in Western societies are nowadays more equal than ever before, Jelinek wants to say that women and men are still strictly attached to certain role models that are almost all power-driven (among which sexual role models). Her sexual desires, although extreme and communicated in the most awkward of possible ways, can not be realized in a relationship. The relationship turns into a sexual battleground, in order to be loved and not lose Walter she has to give in to him, so he eventually vindicates and her total disintegration as a woman starts. The self-inflicted wound in the end only confirming her loss and being a 'punishment' for her choices.The movie's distant and cold-hearted style reflects the book, so there is congruency there. But the movie lacks interesting camera-work as all shots are long and static shots that only move sometimes to follow the characters. I find this combination often deadly for a movie. Compare this to Tarkovsky (long but moving shots) or Koreeda (short but static), both of which can work. Cinematography is almost absent here. Haneke can create shock value from his actors and by editing The transition of the first traditional part to the sex store is rather abrupt, although not on the level of editorial transitions Kubrick makes in Eyes Wide Shut for example. There are some good moments There is no music when the end credits run, the use of Schubert (although used better in Barry Lyndon) as indication of 'decay', Erika never performing for a large audience herself, the mother has no name.On her personal website, Elfriede Jelinek has commented about the movie making process. Not only does she see the meticulous planning process associated with making a movie as restricting and compares that to the choices one has to plan his or her own life. On that website she has also written a very interesting review of Lynch's Lost Highway, one of the more important movies ever made. If ever a director like that could have taken on this intriguing book.

I won't repeat much of what has already been said by those who appreciate the film, but there is one new area I want to touch on... **SPOILERS** Why exactly did the teacher put the broken glass in the student's pocket? Most reviewers have noted that it only reflected her cruelty and reaction to an unsatisfactory performance. I must disagree. Watch the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears as she watches her student playing on stage. The student is quite an expressive girl (crying & vocalizing her fears)- just the opposite of Huppert's character. There is a scene later in the film, after the girl is injured, when Huppert discusses the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly upset, states We gave up everything so she could study piano and Huppert immediately snaps You mean SHE gave up everything, don't you.So it was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. She didn't want the girl to end up like HER, repressed & hardened, condemned to a life of recitals...gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. Maybe she saw herself on the stage years ago, before things grew bad. Maybe she wished she had escaped when she was that age. Is she ruining the student's life, or simply freeing her?For me, that realization made all the difference in what I experienced through this film. Brilliant.

Employed by a music school and after hours giving private piano lessons, the plain, china-doll faced Erika longs for anything other than what she's got.   She lives with her foul and dominant mother whose vitriol only adds  fuel to Erika's already incredible level of self hatred.   Erika finds herself gawking at hardcore pornography with a virginal mix of revulsion and titillation.   We watch Erika's confused and blank face try to make sense of the wild exhibitions on the video screens of a local porno booth.  We watch her watch couples.  We watch her observe sexual rituals- in particular a wild moment at a drive-in. We watch her fight with her mother.  We watch her eyeball the young men that are students.   FINALLY, Erika picks out a handsome young piano student, Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel) who is clearly interested in her cool repose.   Eventually the lines are crossed and Walter is passionately embracing Erika.  Her response again is one of childish titillation and revulsion.  She teases him mercilessly in what has already become a notorious sex scene in a public bathroom.   There's a longing, appropriately desperate sense to their sexual exchanges but the scene - pun intended, doesn't climax.  Walter, now clearly obsessed with the mixed signals that Erika flashes, is drawn closer to her.  When Erika supplies a sexual ultimatum involving her erotic torture and degradation, Walter finds it difficult to understand and unable to commit.   Erika starts to take a darker turn, cruelly lashing out at some of her pupils and her mother (much of the film's more controversial moments involve these aspects of the narrative) while she awaits the response of her unlikely suitor who may or may not perform the requested acts.Isabelle Huppert gives a fearless performance as Erika, the teacher in question and she manages to fill the character with a brooding combination of fawn-like innocence and whorish defiance.  It's a fine line and she walks it very well, even during the narrative's most incredible twists that don't seem especially motivated, she manages to pull it off with a dry, grim face. Director Michael Haneke probably best known for the controversial gratuity of his film Funny Games seems to have found the right tone for the story - but hasn't explored the terrain fully.  In a sense it's as if not even he understands her motivations and merely allows her to move about the narrative ready to burst with madness at any point.    Haneke seems an odd choice for this material but again, his controversial name probably assured financial backing for this film version of what is generally known as a powerful and politically infused novel by Elfriede Jelinek that has a loyal following.This maudlin sexual drama of The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste) is consistently interesting and provocative at best but it's also frustrating and incomplete.  You are left with the constant question WHY?  There's a blankness here, you can't really figure out what the film's point is other than to try and explore sexual self-loathing.   Personally, I needed more to help me understand the depths of her depravity and the necessity of telling this particular tale.If anything, The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste)'s frankness will provoke discussion and much like an entry in the new and questionable 'female-in-deep-punishing-transgression' genre developed by Lars Von Trier, it is memorable.   Be Advised that the film is genuinely of an adult nature in terms of narrative and it also has what is best described as pornographic imagery (insertion, ejaculation etc.).   Those who are easily offended by that sort of material may want to steer clear of The Piano Teacher (La Pianiste). Those of you interested in a film that attempts to offers a frank exploration of sexual obsession and madness through a truly terrific performance by Ms. Hubbert, might be interested in seeing this.

She seems to get off on making men uncomfortable. Walter, a student, who has no qualms in showing his attraction towards her, pursues her. Their first sexual encounter occurs after Erika does something horrible to one of her students. One example of this is when she walks into a porn shop (filled with only men) and brings a instant discomfort in the room.What makes Erika so fascinating is the way she carries herself. She's so uptight and defensive. It's no wonder how she got this far in life without anyone (aside from her mother) didn't know how insane she is. For the first half hour it's slightly difficult to understand her because she is so indecipherable. This aspect of her personality is the antithesis of Walter's. It's obvious what he is about from the beginning. He has a very high view of himself arguably higher than what he really is He has a care free aura about himself often associated with youth. When they first meet, Erika recoils even more but this is when her personality is most revealing. Much of the film Erika is not doing much of anything. She is mostly walking down the street, sitting in her room and other mundane things that contribute nothing to the plot. However, it never seems slow paced or boring. It's in these moments that you realize that she is like a volcano waiting to erupt. It's hard to watch because Erika Kohut is a horrible and evil woman who takes pleasure in being sexually embarrassed. She is a victim to her own self- masochism.

Little did I know when I casually rented this film that it would be as emotionally jarring as it was. To be perfectly honest, I thought the film was going to be about some passionate love affair between the two characters visible on the cover. I imagined that the plot would be predictable and romantic. Never in my life did I expect to see such violence, such unconventional, unexplainable behavior. Bravo Ms. Huppert! Her startling performance as sexually repressed piano teacher Erica Kohut is quite unnerving and memorable. I haven't seen too many films that deliver the kind of shock and devastation that I received from The Piano Teacher, not even Haneke's other horrifying experience, Funny Games (1997). My initial thought about this film was that it had virtually no soundtrack, except for the obvious piano pieces played by Huppert and Benoit Magimel. The absence of sound gives the film a kind of harsh quality, especially in the end. The ending leaves a sour feeling in my stomach every time, like when something important is left unresolved. However, Haneke's art direction is quite excellent, and gives his actors the necessary credibility to convince the audience of their seriousness. A very brutal, graphic depiction of how social boundaries are violated by sexual imparities.

Although they  are  stylistically  quite different ,  both films  are  directed with a  cool  clinician's  eye  and  photographed  and scored  with  an unsettling  dichotomy  between  image  and  sound.  In  Kubrick's 1971 adaptation of  Anthony  Burgess'  futuristic novel  of gang rampage ,  scenes of  rape  are  accompanied  on  the  soundtrack by  the exuberant  strains of  Rossini's   La  gazza  ladra  and  the happy  go  lucky  crooning of  Gene  Kelly's  Singing in the Rain . LA  PIANISTE is  brimming  with  the gorgeous  music of  Franz Schubert  ,  often  showcased in  appropriate  scenes of music recitals  but  at other times  as background  music  for  settings best  described  as  unseemly.  To  be  forced  to  listen  to Schubert  piano  sonatas  and  trios ,  to  take in the luxurious sounds of a baritone  singing  wistful  Schubert  lieder in a film this unpleasant  is  something  of a  masterstroke    and  sick   joke  on  the  part  of  the  filmmaker.Erika  Kohut , a  brilliant  piano  instructor  at  an  esteemed Austrian  Music  Conservatory ,  wields  an  exacting  hand  over her  select  young   students.  Uncompromising  in  her  criticism , she  also  proves  unyielding to  those  especially  vulnerable.  As portrayed  by  Isabelle  Huppert  ,  she  is  an  unbending  foil to both  students  and   fellow  associates.  In  one  of  the  movie's key  scenes ,  a  discussion  among  music  jurors  in  deciding who  to  pick  for  admission  to  the  School ,  Erika  throws  an unnecessary  wrench  into  the  proceedings , objecting vehemently  to  the  unanimous  approval  of  a  gifted   contestant , much  to  the  consternation of  the  committee.What  her  fellow   co-workers  and  students have  no knowledge of  is  the  bleak  and  desperate  private  life  that  consumes  Erika outside  of  the  classroom  situation.  An  attractive  woman  in  her 40's ,  she  shares  an  apartment  with  her  elderly  ,  domineering mother  Annie  Girardot.  When  Erika  arrives  home  hours  after her  last  class ,  her  mother  is  waiting , ready  to  browbeat  her defiant  daughter  at  every  turn.  Both  are  unhappy  women , and they  are  not  above  physically  slapping  each  other  during heightened   arguments.   They  even  share  the  same  bedroom , with  the  two  beds   pushed together. This  close  proximity induces an  atmosphere of   incredible  tension  between  mother and  daughter  ;  no  explanations  are given  in  Mr.  Haneke's screenplay   for  why  these  two  are  so  pathetically  dependent on  each  other ,  but  as  depicted  it  is  obviously  a  situation  that has  lasted ,  and  festered , for  years.With  the  emergence  of  a  handsome ,  charmingly  arrogant young  man  in  one  of  Erika's  Master  Classes ,  the  movie takes  a  dramatic  turn  that  brings  both  teacher  and  student  to a  realization  that  neither  one  expects .  Hostile  to  his  romantic overtures ,  Erika  is   nevertheless  attracted  to  his  schoolboy crush  on  her ;  slowly  but  inevitably   Erika's  ice  cold  demeanor begins  to  crack ,  but  instead  of  warming  up  she  presents vulgar  demands during  their  brief  courtship  that  prove  so  inept and  disastrous  that  they  backfire ,  leading  to disastrous consequences.This  is  not  an  easy  movie  to  like.  It is one  that  I  admire.  It lays  bare  the  life  of  an  immensely  gifted  artist  who , although disciplined  in  her  love  of  music  and  work ,  has  no  outer  life to  speak  of.  The  movie  does  not  explain  the  reasons  why; perhaps  that  is  better  left  to  reading  the  novel.  Haneke seems  interested  in  observing objectively .  Erika  is  such  an amalgam of  self  hate ,  spite  and  jealousy  that  it  is  a  miracle we  sit  in  the  theater  and  watch  her  at  all.  That  we  do  is  a testament  to  the  genius  of  Isabelle  Huppert ,  who  gives  one of  those  rare , monumental  performances  that  burns  up  the screen.  Somehow  she  is  able  to  project  the  despairing humanity  that  inhabits  Erika, so  that  even  when  she  indirectly perpetrates  a  vicious act  of  cruelty  on  an  unsuspecting student ,  we  continue  to  watch.This is not a film  for  everyone.  Erika's  night -time  forays  to  sex shops  and  drive - in  theaters  are  not  the  stuff of  mainstream entertainment ;  but  as  a  character  study of  one  gifted but unfulfilled  individual ,  this  movie  is  unflinching  in  its  honesty and  depiction  of  human  behavior.

(When not suffering from puke-breath--a crazy-girl malady known to all bulimics and serial antidepressant-chewers--her body, we are told, just...gives off odor.) She's every clamped-down badass Anti-Mom you ever hated. She's Nurse Ratched beating time on a tick-tock metronome. She's the voice on the other end at the phone company turning you down without a hint of sorrow in her I'm so sorry. She's every cold, unfeeling, control-crazed female boss, teacher, authority figure you've ever had--and this time, Michael Haneke is going to get payback. He's going to show you things you didn't see when she was torturing you in uniform.Well, what is there to show? Mostly, hypocrisy--not conscious two-facedness, but the sadder, furtive, ratlike scuttling of a woman whom Control-Mania has turned into the trembliest sort of closet perv. (There is a very funny moment when the Piano Teacher, busted, walks away from a teenybopper she has peeping-tommed with the head-erect, proud-mary posture she uses to stride away from the piano grand.) La Pianiste (played by Isabelle Huppert) seems to meet her match in a talented young pianist. But what's going to happen? Is he going to crumble under her sadistic, mean-mommy thumb, or, like the hero of VENUS IN FURS, will he now become the hammer, she the anvil?THE PIANO TEACHER is the shrillest, most unapologetically straight-up woman-hating film in many a year; but there is a bit more to it than that. Start with the primary instrument of Haneke's payback against the withholding women of the world--Isabelle Huppert's face. There seems to be a law, a kindly one, that says that French beauties become Great Actresses when they lose their looks. It wasn't true of Catherine Deneuve (who, at least, was a great movie star and a great object in her heyday) and it isn't true of Isabelle Huppert, about whom Kael once memorable wrote that there are many reasons not to go to movies nowadays, but the omnipresence of Huppert in them ranks among the first. Haneke double-deals he pretends that the movie is an AUTUMN SONATA- style vehicle for a Huppert tour-de-force performance (it is, in fact, at many moments a conscious parody of Bergman's film) and at the same time gets eepy-creepy mileage off the appearance of Huppert's awful decline. That freckly farm-girl face with those oddly open eyes that once seemed an invitation to raunchy fun now has curdled to a point nearing Sissy Spacek's unself-protected honesty. And the character of the Piano Teacher--psychologically enslaved by a meanie mommy who makes her sleep in the same bed--seems to be both reflected in and mocked by Huppert's ruined looks. (You had your chance when you were hot, Haneke's camera seems to sneer at her, and look at you now!)Though the whole movie seems a set-up to beat on this iron-fisted negator of maternality, a few surprising moments worthy of the wrinkles in a Strindberg play leak in. After the Piano Teacher sees her Adonis comforting a nervous female student, Huppert grinds broken glass and pours it into the female's coat pocket. When the Adonis figures out that the Teacher is the mutilator of the girl's hand, he runs into the ladies' bathroom where she is arousedly tinkling. We expect he will kick the stall door down and beat her silly--instead, he leaps up to the top of the stall door, peers over, and initiates some helplessly aroused sex-play. And later, when the Piano Teacher tries to control this impulsive making-out, the Adonis recovers his dignity by doing jumping, running-in-place, and Jake LaMottaish speed-boxing maneuvers, right in Huppert's face--a reminder of his superior youth and vigor that one-ups her brainier forms of control.THE PIANO TEACHER gets at some interesting issues about sex and control When does giving it up just mean another, reordered form of controlling everything? But Haneke's approach is closer to the brazen rape-fantasy of a slasher movie than anything more...what? Serious? Meditative? Haneke lives in a world where bitches get what they deserve, whether it's the twittering bourgeois mom (who plays an even more pathetic twittering bourgeois mom in THE PIANO TEACHER) getting dumped in the river with a sardonic Ciao bella!, or the pain-seeking Pianiste getting way more than she bargained for.At moments, THE PIANO TEACHER seems to be a parody of an art movie--or of other people's art movies. (When Haneke uses the music Kubrick used for Redmond Barry's approach to Lady Lyndon to accompany Huppert's Kleenex-worship in the porn shop, one has to think the effect is conscious.) Haneke digs assiduously, and sometimes flips a scene in directions you couldn't have expected. But mostly the movie seems to be made of unsweet revenge. For his highbrow trimmings, Haneke seems to identify with the mean young jocks who terrorize the helpless in his pictures. Haneke can rationalize and pontificate all he pleases; but the audience can feel where an artist's deepest affections lie.

The sexual themes are closer to X-rated than R-rated, and the graphic imagery in the unrated cut is definitely worthy of an X-rating. If you are comfortable with X-rated themes and imagery, an additional hurdle still remains. The first hour of the film is inefficient (shall we say) character development. The relationship between mother and daughter unfold slowly. The relationship between the main character and her love interest develop slowly. The somewhat depraved manifestations of the main character's masochistic (and passive-aggressive sadism) are revealed quite slowly. To be sure, the main character's maladjusted behavior is critical to character development, but the vignettes of her behaviors are separated by repetitive relationship scenes that add little depth to the plot. Furthermore, the main character's sexual fantasies, which are revealed in the second half of the movie, and her lover's reaction do not require extensive character development to be believable.Overall the script writer and director skillfully create scenes that elicit emotional responses from the viewer, and those responses tell the viewer something about himself/herself. In that way, The Piano Teacher is a worthwhile European romance/relationship film, which ventures into territory untouched by most US directors and production companies.

Erika is approaching middle age-she is a highly respected and equally demanding instructor at the conservatory of music in Vienna. Erika is stone cold--distant, unsmiling, she leads a secret life of self-mutilation. In the classroom she sits without emotion, but listens attentively to her students. She doesn't want to help her students however--she wants to destroy them. Erika lives with her domineering mother, who is immediately subjected to her mother's demanding questions the minute she walks through the door. We quickly realize Erika is completely manipulated and owned by her mother's invasive possessiveness. Instantly Erika resorts to behaving like a child, or a rebellious teenager at best. They both sleep in the bed together. Her mother (a chillingly unsympathetic Annie Girardot), complains and is bitter about money Erika is squandering. Pleading, shouting, and violence is followed by brief tearful apologies-- and it is obvious that this is a well-worn habitual pattern. She intrusively rings Erika when she is rehearsing, and apparently has no life of her own. Enter Walter Klemmer (BenoÃ®t Magimel), who is a handsome, self-assured student who auditions for her class and is forthright in his attraction to her. She responds coldly then demands he let her lead. Then she changes the role with a detailed letter, inviting him into her dark, twisted fantasies. The sex scenes within the movie, while not graphic, are long, uncomfortable--and psychologically brutal. The movie goes to a place of mad masochism. At a certain point we begin to feel that the director, the characters, and the actors will take this anywhere--there are no boundaries. Erika is not simply an adventuress, or a sexual experimenter--Erika is a psychological train wreck. Walter's dreams and thoughts about an experienced older woman have turned into nightmares about interactions and scenarios he doesn't even want to know about. Erika is a highly respected professor at the prestigious Vienna conservatory, who just happens to spend her free time visiting pornography dens and mutilating her genitals. The women is a ticking time bomb that's on the verge of exploding at any given point. Some audience members will dislike the ending, but with a film like this any conventional ending would be a cop-out.

In brief, this is the story of the inner world of an exceptional pianist and piano teacher who lives with her mother in a 'marriage arrangement' that appears to satisfy both with its accompanying fights, jealousies, cheatings, and clingings. This cold pianist (incomparably portrayed by the fine Isabelle Huppert) is absorbed by Schubert and Schumann and shares many of those composers' tendencies towards madness and melancholy. Her private acting out of her sexual life includes forays into pornography video booths, drive-in movies for voyeurism, and other sadomasochistic practices that leave her frustrated in her drive to be humiliated and beaten. Into this sad woman's life enters a sensuously handsome student (again, played with complete credibility and finesse by Benoit Magimel) and much of the film is a hard driving match between lust/desire and need/repulsion, the true approach/avoidance conflict. The pace of the film is so correct for a story about the extended periods of ennui between moments of exhilaration that mirror the life inside a music academy. We are treated to some wonderful Schubert, Schumann, Schonberg, and Bach that serves as the 'dialogue' during extended scenes where the piano teacher listens with her eyes and ears and distorted mind, reacting to the music in equal parts with the performing students. Yes, this is a disturbing film, but it is not a grotesque film. Director Michael Haneke manages to place this surreal sexual tragedy for us to understand just how wide the bell curve of human sexuality stretches. An astonishingly fine film - if you are open to explore the dark interstices of the human mind without prejudice. An added feature of an interview on the DVD with Isabelle Huppert about the character she portrays is exceptionally apropos and well filmed.

One thing to say is that it is extremely challenging viewing and if you are unsure of watching this make sure you know what you are in for first. Not that anything could prepare you for this film, but be aware that it is a dark and often disturbing look into some of the most troublesome aspects of human behaviour.I can't say that this is an enjoyable film - that surely isn't the right word. However, this is filmmaking at its very best, coupled with a central performance from Isabelle Huppert that genuinely deserves the high praise it has received. I was only introduced to Michael Haneke very recently, and this is only the 2nd of his films that I have seen, but he is clearly an incredibly gifted director and writer who makes films almost unlike any others I have seen.Films of sustained intensity and anxiety are quite rare, and there are very few films I have seen that are able to achieve the intense and foreboding atmosphere that Haneke, and also Isabelle Huppert, craft here. What is unique is that Haneke doesn't rely on a chilling musical score to build tension, nor is the film cast in dark and brooding light that suggests to us what the underlying nature of the story is. Haneke builds the tension with supreme subtlety and ingenious craft. The only music that is used comes from the piano playing of the characters themselves; the beautiful and artistic music is juxtaposed with the dark and secretive thoughts of Erika. We gradually delve into the troubled mind of the otherwise austere piano teacher, Erika, and get glimpses of a side of her which initially seems almost out of place. Her acts are played out to a backdrop of a sad and lonely existence, one in which she is still controlled by a domineering and rather embittered mother. The mother, played excellently by Annie Girardot, perhaps gives us a tiny insight into why Erika feels trapped and repressed.Huppert is astounding and the subtle nuances of her performance are indicative of an actress at the very top of her game. Huppert conveys so much fear, sadness, lust, anger and even love through a veneer of temperance. She constantly reminds us that these feelings are largely repressed and yet we can see them bubbling under the surface. Huppert betrays these underlying dark emotions often with as little as a slight shift in her facial expression &#x96; make no mistake this is acting of the highest calibre; subtle, understated and yet utterly powerful and compelling.The actions of Erika are often quite alarming and certainly not appealing, and yet it is the hallmark of excellence, in both Haneke's script and Huppert's performance, that we can still sympathise with this woman. Even, if it is only a fleeting glimpse of sympathy or understanding &#x96; it is still there. That is how I felt, and that is another reason why the film is so challenging. Should I feel sympathy? Should I feel anger? Should I feel disgust? Haneke doesn't insist that we feel one way or another, he lets the power of the story carry itself and the viewer is left to sift through this thickened sea of conflicting emotion.As I said at the start, I don't think I can do this film justice on paper &#x96; it has to be seen; and if you do choose to see it you will get something much more &#x96; you will feel your way through it. As I watched this film I felt an array of different emotions; I was gripped, tense, anxious, saddened, disgusted and much more. By the end I had a barrage of unanswered questions and I wasn't even sure how to feel about what I'd seen. That is the beauty, and I do mean beauty, of this incredibly thought-provoking and dark film. If after reading this you think you can stomach the content then I would encourage you to watch it for a very unique film experience. It is a breathtaking film but one that might well leave you with an uncomfortable feeling deep in the recesses of your subconscious. 9/10.

Between the three films I've seen of his- Funny Games (US), Cache and now The Piano Teacher- he's certainly not a director to make his films boring. This is to his credit as a provocateur more-so than as a genuine art-house/Euro talent; his work is a kin to giving you a swift kick in the nuts, giving a tid-bit of ice for the wound, and then having you watching in eager anticipation for the next event to come. It didn't work for Funny Games very well, and for Cache it worked at almost masterful levels. For the Piano Teacher, which may be the most disturbing of Europe's crop of psycho-sexual dramas of the decade, deals out its main character as something between a side character in Barry Lyndon and, well, your local cold-fish of a teacher at school, but it's not a cold movie, per-say.Rather, The Piano Teacher never moves its gaze from its characters movements or actions, usually going right with the action without 'flashy' turns, and the only music coming out of those luminous numbers from Schubert and, oddly enough, that one numbner from Barry Lyndon. And at the center of Haneke's torrid drama is Isabele Hupert in the title role, playing a woman who still lives with her mother (one of the most fascinating things for me in the film, something that adds a whole other level of the psychological tension, perverseness), and rarely has a good word to say about anyone's musical ability. Least of all for the young man (played very well by Benoit Magnimel), who has an affinity for Schubert and finds something in this teacher he wants to know more; he pursues the poisition of student very much despite being rejected by her. But then they meet again, in a manner that is so deranged I dare not mention it here (let's just say it's a manner of horrible, unforgivable payback that says all that needs to be said about Hupert's insecurities).Like Last Tango in Paris, the sexual congress is intense, rough, and uncompromising for what many of us consider practical, loving contact. These characters- in Haneke's universe probably more- are driven by obsessive needs and something they can't express, and ironically, when Hupert puts her thoughts and desires all out there in un-poetic writing, it becomes the Achilles heel. There's a lot that Haneke explores here that sparks interest, and I found myself thinking about the ideas and the cold look of Hupert (one that, showing how great she is in the part, you keep looking for the slightest change of the guard) and why it didn't totally knock me off my feet... Maybe it did, in a manner of speaking. By the end of the film, which concludes perhaps logically if somewhat randomly, I was shocked and appalled, but I also knew I had seen something powerful and challenging to boot. How do we contemplate these characters that are seemingly the everyday sort but are dark and depraved and wanting something from someone that they can't get? In short, The Piano Teacher works best as a tale of loss, I suppose, or of never having it in the first place.

As the protagonist, Erika, Isabelle Huppert gives a career-best, tour de force performance as the tortured Piano professor whose desire is in excess of social norms governing heterosexual couplings.Many have seen the film as an expression of Erika's sexual oppression but this is far from the case. Erika is never afraid to indulge her dark, sexual desire, whether it be in a sleazy porn shop or while voyeuristically watching young lovers kiss in an open-air cinema. Erika's sexuality is in excess of her allocated neutered role in society and this is why she never achieves harmony with Walter, whom she loves in her own prescriptive way yet he cannot reciprocate her desire which is even more masculine than his.Goverened by technicality and precision akin to her role as a respected Professor, Haneke portrays Erika as a subversive character but she is also a figure who enlists our sympathy and empathy; and herein lies the emotional power of Haneke's adaptation. Erika is all too human and in spite of her exacting and at times callous nature, she demands to be loved, even if her demands go beyond what is deemed normal in heterosexual unions where male/female equals aggressive/passive, dominant/subservient.Hanke, as always, is a master of visuals and here he demonstrates his command of the form. There are many unforgettable scenes and innovative camera angles and also a a sense of dream-like intensity in some scenes that Haneke quietly brings in to the film at unexpected moments. The film ranks as one of Haneke's best but is not for the faint of heart.

I 'googled' and read about him a bit more; a professor of directing at Vienna Film Academy, student of psychology, philosophy and theatrical science; PhD at Harvard. And I liked his quote &#150; &#133;if 300 people are in a cinema watching it (the movie) they will all see a different film&#133; It tells all about the man and his movies. I think he wants to present something to the audience that will startle them &#150; they will either love his movies or hate it. And I sincerely say that I loved his movie.The story is about a Piano teacher &#150; played brilliantly by Isabelle Huppert - who is staying alone with her mother, and has repressed sexual desires &#150; that she gratifies by indulging in self mutilations and longs for sadistic beatings during sex. (I did not know that this is classified as a psychological category &#150; masochist &#150; but I know now after seeing the movie). Isabelle is talented, strict with her students and does not tolerate any mistakes. She encounters a student &#150; played by Benoit Magimel &#150; who falls in love with her, and on knowing this Isabelle wants him to gratify her sexual fantasies. I won't tell you more about the movie and spoil your pleasure of watching it.The movie has explicit sexual content. The movie has unusual central character of Erika Kohut &#150; played by Isabelle. Some people may not accept the existence of such masochistic character, but I think at least some of them exist in our society and Michael has taken courage to show their side of the story.The piano score is top-class, the camera setting is perfect, it allows you to dwell deep into the scene, the light and shade, the breaking of cinematography balance (I think Michael does it intentionally) and close-ups to go into the psyche of the characters.The acting is marvelous and all the three characters &#150; mother, piano teacher and student have performed excellently and amazingly all three of them have won best actor, actress and supporting actress awards in different Film festivals.(Stars 8.5 out of 10) "},{"Title":"A Teacher of piano teaches just piano - oui?","Date":"29 January 2006","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The more 'disturbing' scenes are in fact very disturbing and the gut reaction is to alienate ourselves from the characters in the scene as layer after layer of human vulnerability is exposed.

Not that we all need to be as twisted as Hanakes characters, but somehow you can relate to them and that is the shocking part. Especially in La Pianiste you can feel the social isolation that Hupert created for herself. The ugliness that drips from the outer facade. You also know that she's helpless the moment she opened up to Magimel (Klemmer) and from that moment on is nothing more than a fragile puppet.Both on the story that is being told, and the contemporary social issues that are involved Just watch this one, if you dare.

I think that Erika is suffering from similar mental illness(es) as pertains to her father (whom we find out went insane, then later that he dies during the course of the film in the asylum). FURTHERMORE, I believe that her enslavement to her mother MUST come from more than just some kind of long-term build-up of stronger and stronger emotions and mental illness re sexuality and power struggles. I.e., I believe she was probably sexually abused and/or molested by the mother, and perhaps by the father, as well. Re the scene where Walter rejects her after she gives him her letter spelling out how their relationship is to work and what she desires, she lays beside her mother in bed before leaping on her mother, screaming that she loves her and attempting to engage her mom in sex. I believe that a past such as this (or something within the same kind of traumatic experiences) provides explanation and motive for her actions and state of mind/being. Re the end... I don't believe she dies. Like many great French films that leave you without a nice, clean ending =) in my opinion, what is likely is that she will wind up following the same fate as her father... she has a knife wound, but considering WHERE she stabbed herself AND the fact that the sheer force required to make that kind of wound LIFE-threatening is not something she did when she carried out the act, I concluded that she she would wander the street bleeding until someone would simply notice her condition, ask her if she needed help, etc. etc. until she was taken to a hospital or into police custody (and THEN to a hospital) after which she would be committed to a psychiatric facility where she would spend the rest of her life.

Very impressive, gripping drama about a middle-aged daughter (Erika) who cannot get rid of her mother's selfish, sick love. This relationship is not a love more like an obsession. Affectionate and loathsome attachment. Erika is a snobbish, sadistic piano teacher who enjoys humiliating her pupils. On a private concert she meets Walter, a young, talented pianist. Walter falls for Erika but she has her own rules in love which makes him abhor, confused and disappointed. She stretches the border-lines in this relationship till it is too late. Isabelle Huppert as Erika is cold, piteous, but still makes you want to slap her for her snobbish, sadistic behavior. Brilliant as always, supposedly this cold, sexually deviant, aristocratic part suits her the most. Benoit Magimel as Walter is poignantly handsome, exalted, vibrating but a bit light-minded talent. Also superb. I might not recommend this movie to everyone but those people who really like to be shocked, who like art movies flavored with deviance, and who love living in the atmosphere of a movie for hours or days.

Her life is regimented and controlled by her overbearing mother, played by Annie Girardot. It seems her life has always been this way, as Erika has never been in any kind of relationship. Her mother has pushed her to become a piano virtuoso, at the expense of a social life or any social skills. She cannot go out without explaining every minute to her mother. She teaches piano to children of parents who are probably just as overbearing as her own mother; these parents' lives centre around an endless stream of recital after recital for their kids. Erika was once a student, and now she is a teacher, so she is just prolonging this banal pastime into the next generation. She belittles her students, probably much like she was belittled by her own teachers. The piano recital community produces a lot of miserable people. Erika has a secret life to escape from her stifling existence. She visits peep shows and erotic bookstores. She has been so repressed for so long that her sexual fantasies have gone into the perverse territory of sado-masocism now. She doesn't dream of tender love, she dreams of being beaten and controlled.She eventually meets Walter, a handsome, highly-talented twenty-something engineering student. Walter is nothing like Erika or any of her repressed students. He is multi-talented and charming. He plays sports, is in engineering, and at the same time he is a great piano player. Walter can be anything he wants, including a piano virtuoso, he is not forced into it like all of these other people. Walter zeros in on her after meeting her, and wants her right away. She wants him too, but her lack of social skills seems to make it look like she detests him. In actual fact, she is hiding behind a facade of arrogance. Walter eventually decides to take piano lessons from her to get close to her. Erika just keeps acting arrogant, but this is part of her masochistic fantasy, and eventually she reveals her fantasies to him. Walter is shocked that she has such sick fantasies, when all he wanted to do was love her. Walter starts to feel repulsed by her, because of her fantasies. Erika realizes this, and makes attempts to come to his point of view. At the same time, Walter seems to start showing some interest in Erika's sado-masocism. At the end a very unsatisfying compromise is achieved by both Walter and Erika. Erika gets to fulfill her fantasy, but it's not all she expected.

Shine and the The Piano also feature characters in some way damaged by the rigors and strong emotions of mastering such an instrument.Isabelle Huppert in the piano teacher is another damaged pianist to add to the list.  She misses an absent father and is stifled by a neurotic, claustrophobic love/hate relationship with her mother with whom she lives. More than that she is saturated with the strong emotions of the music she so painstakingly perfects.  With no emotional outlets she is driven to self harm, with no sexual outlets to voyeuristic acts that you feel she almost wants to be caught in.However Haneke doesn't try to make us pity her.  Rather this is a cold objective view, mirrored in the cool colours and highly constructed frames in which this film is shot.  She is both a victim and cruel in her own turn. Cold to her students and given to sadistic acts such as the mind games she plays on the pupil she spots looking at a porn magazine in a newsagents.Into this Benoit Magimel comes a wonder boy, infatuated with Huppert. Foppish good books and the mannerisms of a stage lover are jolted when Huppert sets out her S&M agenda.  The relationship becomes violent and damaging in unintended ways leading to the shocking climax.This is a terrifyingly believable (if extreme) view of a chain of damage that emotionally distressed individuals inflict on each other.  The film is all the more painful as there are no good or bad characters, simply characters who the more they want to be loved the more they are hurt and do harm.The perfect emotional pitch of the classical music they are producing only serves to highlight their emotional turmoils.  Striving for perfection is their downfall.

Such is the case for La Pianiste (or the English title -- The Piano Teacher).I had no problem with the English subtitles.  What I found disturbing was the story and the method that the movie scenes were composed.This film came to East Central Illinois as an un-rated Art film.  I would have rated it as an Adult Film with an X tag for it's sexual content and graphic depiction of sexual acts in certain scenes.Only three actors need to be commented on Isabelle Ann Huppert, Benoit Magimel, and Annie Suzanne Girardot.Ms. Huppert looked every bit of her middle age of 46 years when this film was made in 2001.  Granted that she was supposed to look plain and mousy as a virgin and sexual deviant music Professor at a Viennese Music Conservatory, but, a little cover-up makeup would have minimized all the natural freckles this actress possesses.  Ms. Huppert with 81 films completed since she started acting at aged 16 years is obviously well-qualified.  However, the script relies mostly on her not saying words and using her facial distortions to relate the story.  It is weird to see a story whereby the female lead is so sexually frustrated as a primary plot.  Erika Kohut sexually teases Walter Klemmer by performing manual and oral sex acts upon him to set him up for her further intense desires.  Most women would not want to relate to such a storyline.  Younger Benoit Magimel, 28 years old, is also a veteran French actor having completed 25 film projects since he started acting at age 14.  Mr. Magimel was very well suited for the part as a younger male, Walter Klemmer, seeking entry into Professor Erika Kohut's selective piano music class.  He becomes enamored with his teacher, yet, it would appear most unlikely that having known her for such a brief period that he should profess to her that he loves the older woman.  Magimel eventually carries out Professor Kohut's perverted sexual instructions and plays the game by physically mistreating her and raping her on her apartment floor.Ms. Girardot is a 71 year old Parisian veteran actress with 131 film projects.  She plays Erika's live at home mother who dominates her spinster daughter in an overly protective manner.  Her performance is right on character and done well.What I find upsetting about this film is it's lack of intelligent dialogue, assuming that the English subtitles faithfully parallels the spoken French language.  Further, as with many European films, too much is attempted to be displayed visually and it bogs down the storyline.  Choppy and meaningless scenes take up some valuable film time which could be better used with more dialogue between the major players.  Some scenes were outright confusing and didn't advance the story.  No mention of Professor Kohut's father was made during the story, except when Erika comes home late one night after her usual perverted visit to an adult store where she engages in viewing adult videos with explicit sexual acts.  Her mother screams at her demanding to know where she has been, as if she were a child, and slaps her in the face and blurts out that Your father died.  The scene is cut and no further mention of Erika's father or any emotion is shown.  As there was no mention of her father before, and it is obvious that the mother and daughter live together, any reference to Erika's father is a waste of film and doesn't advance the story.Another scene of importance lacked the attention to detail of which the well-known director Michael Haneke should have been aware.  When Professor Kohut wields the knife as a weapon, there should have been at least a little theater blood on the tip of the knife, especially when a close-up is used to show this portion of the plot.  When Ms. Huppert nonchalantly walks out of the Conservatory building into the night streets of Vienna the film ends leaving the audience without a hint of what was to happen next.  It's like the director said oops, end of time, end film, movie's over! As mentioned, I find European movie-story telling much different from American movie-story telling.  I am sure that books written in other countries don't tell such choppy tales nor ends so abruptly.  It's just lazy film making, in this reviewer's viewpoint.Whereas, some newspaper movie reviewers gave this film raves and four-stars, I disagree.  Just because it's a weird film and has perverted sexual experiences for a woman doesn't warrant that high a rating.  Two stars is the maximum!

But she does have violent fantasies, and when she meets the young enthusiast of the classics Walter(Magimel, fantastic, holding his own against a woman 20 years his senior), she may be able to live them out - even if doing so poses great risks to herself.This is gripping from start to finish. It is not for everyone, and I mean no offense to those who aren't in the intended audience. There are a lot of long takes with few people in the shot, a lot of silence, few cuts or close-ups, little in the way of movement of the camera, and largely basic angles and compositions. It's driven by the acting and dialog(with many mean, even cruel, lines, to an extent equally divided between the leads - there is no room for failure in the perfectionist world of performing arts that require that much talent, nor is there a way to impress, at most, be thought to be good enough). There are no real plot twists, merely a spiral towards the inevitable awful outcome. This sets up some themes and characters, and explores them, thoroughly. Our protagonist has no make-up, and this is an example of this not holding back, not covering up imperfections, it is bare and harsh, and all the better for it. This is only the second film of Michael Haneke I've watched, the other being The White Ribbon, but I love both of them, and will be seek out more of his work.This goes into selfishness vs. sacrifice, disgust vs. understanding, complete acceptance vs. unrepentant rejection, what is proper and what is not. Add to that the way the world of yesterday's sensual (in direct contact with, not theory but talent for playing, composing) love of art being shoved aside by, and for the sake of, modern intellectualism(study of theory) and crowd-pleasers such as sports. Most of all, it is about sado-masochism. This goes into that subject without misrepresenting(unlike 50 Shades of Grey) and free of judgment. It is, however, deeply unsettling, showing the negatives that can come from it, whilst clearly showing that they aren't inherent to it. When it isn't practiced in a healthy relationship based on trust, where the partners use safe-words, consent and aftercare. Because when someone has suppressed something for the longest time, it can be an explosion when the faucet is finally turned on. We see how the greatest perversity may be borne of the strongest repressive environment, and that just because one's sexuality has not been expressed, doesn't mean it's gone.This contains a near-constant tension, mostly regarding disturbing content, a lot of sexuality, some of it graphic and/or violent. It is a movie that is sometimes arousing, other times revolting, one that dares you to look on yet is impossible to take your eyes off. I recommend this to everyone who is not put off by the subject nor the unflinching approach to it. 8/10 "}{"Title":"Love is a strange thing?","Date":"13 July 2004","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Love is a strange thing and you often fall for the wrong person!

He will never love her the way she loves him and the way she wants to be loved. He is just another flamboyant boy and one day, he will dump her for another woman. The rest of the movie just shows her self-destructive behavior to destroy the increasing desire for love.Pretty much the same common theme often shows in some French films.

And it really hurts to see that the rating here is 8.2 (19 votes), when I started to write this, and that this film won a couple of awards in Cannes. Not that Cannes can be taken seriously anymore, but still...The film is about a piano teacher (don't confuse this film with THE PIANO However!), who doesn't want any of her students to surpass her, who gets involved with a brilliant new student in a perverse sexual relationship, and who is dominated by her insane mother (who, in the end, doesn't seem so insane anymore, after all that we saw before).

They're both about sick minds, but whereas FUNNY GAMES was shocking and definitely had substance, this film is just boring and shallow. It's about sex, sexual perversion, people who aren't able to express their feelings, ... did I say that it was about sick people?

Isabelle Huppert runs with the ball. She's a distinguished professor of music in Paris. Students compete for admission to her Master Class in piano.I'm not sure why. She's evidently an inspiring teacher. She obviously loves music. But, my God, is she demanding. And stern and distant and icy. Her hair is severely swept back and she never smiles. She has no sense of humor, no role distance, and her ordinary social graces are no better than perfunctory. You get a feeling that if she stared at you too long you'd turn into an ice sculpture than only faintly resembled your original self.I had judged -- from the DVD case cover, showing her struggling in a kiss with a younger man while kneeling on a bathroom floor -- that this was going to be a sort of Lolita with the genders reversed, some kind of pathetic tragedy. Beautiful sexual interludes with softly billowing curtains and scented candles, ending with a funeral in the rain.But, no. It's pretty good. As for the performances, we have the central figure of the middle-aged spinster Huppert, locked into her frigid respectability. And then there is Annie Girardot as her disputatious and domineering mother, Girardot who was a sexy presence all over the screen in the 1960s, now become a magnificent wreck. The passing years do that to everyone except me. I seem to grow more youthfully radiant with every passing day. BenoÃ®t Magimel is tall, muscular, handsome, and a talented if flippant pianist in her class, but if at first he's an ardent admirer, maybe a little too ardent, he becomes a cipher.Well, we know ahead of time that Huppert is going to bust loose. She has to, otherwise we have a pretty dreary film experience ahead of us. And she does bust loose, but not in ways anyone might expect. She's utterly sexless until she boldly walks into some sort of porno shop, rents a booth, and watches skin flicks without any expression. Then she picks up a discarded tissue from the floor and holds it against her nose. A little twisted, if you ask me. And not just that, but she perches on the rim of her bath tub, spreads her legs, reaches up into her crotch, fiddles around and winces. Okay. We're all adults so we think we know what's up. But then she withdraws her hand and we see that it's holding a razor blade, and we notice a trickle of blood running into the tub. This is many leagues away from soft core porn.The first half ends with her responding to Magimel's protestations of love but again not in the way we might expect. She deliberately arouses Magimel physically on that bathroom floor but leaves him hanging, exiting with an expression of disdain. Later, despite her mother's strenuous objections she takes Magimel into her bedroom. She takes him; she doesn't invite him. And she makes him read aloud the terms of her agreement with him before they engage in any hanky panky. She wants to be blindfolded, slapped, tied up really tight, and made to rim him. That's -- how you say? -- degoutant.That's about the half-way point. After that the movie more or less collapses and throws logic and character to the winds. Magimel, after reading her list of demands, calls her pathetic and sick. He tells her she needs treatment. Then he stalks out of the bedroom, offended, revolted. Any normal kid his age would try to talk her down, negotiate with her. How about if we eliminate Demand Number Five?, or something. But his change in attitude is instantaneous and resolute.It gets worse. He barges into her apartment in the middle of the night, locks the howling mother in her room, and begins slapping and kicking Huppert around on the floor before more or less raping her almost lifeless body in its blood-splashed nightgown. She lies there numb while he makes some stupid remarks about this being what she wanted. Then he leaves her flat. I won't give away the climactic scene.That first half is very good, though, partly because there are some satisfying snatches of classical music -- Bach and some others but most Schubert. Some of today's younger audiences might expect to be intimidated, bored, or both -- but would they be right? That same demographic swallowed painlessly through a number of Stanley Kubrick's movies that featured both Strausses plus Beethoven. Not to mention Amadeus. And, throughout, both Huppert and Girardot are unimpeachable.

It could only appeal to someone who is mentally ill, afflicted with various sexual fetishes or perversions and wants to compare notes, or those desperately seeking some weird off-putting pseudo-artsy film upon which to pontificate how excellent such a misunderstood film truly is, so they can try impress their friends, should they have any remaining.No normal person could find anything to justify spending two solid hours watching this shallow drivel, when it could have been spent watching something enriching, rewarding, and which took talent to create.  For yes, we know there are sick people out there.  We know there is S&M.  We know there are masochistic people out there who enjoy getting slapped around. But does anyone want to spend two hours watching a film that really goes no deeper than to remind us of that?There's really no character development to this award winning movie. The central character is revealed as little more than a cold, nasty, arrogant, belittling woman who is saved from being a total social reject, because no decent person would have any desire to be around her or put up with her, only because she plays the piano well.  This is her public face.  Her private one is that of a simple standard everyday garden variety masochist who likes to get slapped around.  Ho, hum.

The strength of Elfriede Jelinek's terrific novel consisted in his completely negative attitude towards sexuality, almost identifying its point of view with that of Erika - but as the latter was unbearable, too, and obviously sick, the reader had no choice except finding a solution in a complete negation of the space of the piece. Haneke, on the other hand, tries to tell the story didactically We have to listen to shallow and stupid phrases like You are not able to love, Erika, I won't feel anything and so on, phrases that EXPLAIN something that was sufficiently SHOWN by Huppert's stunning performance and by the whole plot; while Benoits Klemmer is supposed to be the charming, 'sincere' boy who would do it all right if the piano teacher only let him. So, the whole thing becomes a boring tale about sickness and health, with health as the less convincing part. Possibly, this intelligent director did a mistake in conceiving the topic as a DRAMA instead of a baudelairean POEM; perhaps the problem is deeply generic and it was impossible to make a good movie from DIE KLAVIERSPIELERIN.

Then I was thinking about an article I read this week in The Chronicle of Higher Education about how more and more colleges are establishing codes of conduct for teacher/student relationships and boy this school could use one.Then I was just relieved that at least the hunky student (Benoit Magimel) breathed some sanity, fresh air and old-fashioned, enthusiastic lust into the movie for awhile and I, wow, sided with him against beautiful, twisted martinet professor Isabelle Hupert, and with him too against her extremely controlling mother (Annie Girardot), as he in effect became the mature teacher in the relationship. As the whole audience got more and more disgusted (literally), one guy tried to claim this was really a metaphor for hypocritical politicians, but we all pretty much snorted at him.There could be a socially redeeming feminist theme here somewhere (as when the macho hockey players chase the delicate figure skaters off the ice rink over which Huppert later escapes a disastrous sexual encounter), a la Catherine Breillat's sexually brutal films, but director Michael Haneke adapted it with the novelist Elfriede Jelinek.(originally written 4/6/2002) "},{"Title":"Good acting, poor execution","Date":"16 November 2002","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  No director's films I have ever watched will make you squirm in your seat, or get your mind racing like Haneke.  He still lives up to his old style in this film, about a repressed older piano teacher who can only express her control and emotions in the most authoritative and disturbing ways.  Hupert plays a teacher who berates her students to the point of tears.  She is stuffy, cold, repressed and heartless.  But one day a young man who is infatuated with her tries to join her class and start a love affair.  Now if this were a typical Hollywood film we'd have the same predictable script you can all see, their love is forbidden, but he saves her, the agony!, the tears!.. but far from it.It turns out that what the piano teacher wants out of the relationship is control.  But her desires are so repressed that it ends up transforming in cruel ways, and perhaps not for the better of the 2 parties involved.  While this film is wonderfully acted (Isabelle received best actress for this role at Cannes), it still ends up a little too forced and uninteresting.  Some scenes just drag, and at times you care for those involved, but at other times you couldn't care what happens next.  Also I felt the ending didn't provide me with a conclusion (which is ok sometimes) but it didn't provide me with an insight into what might happen later between the 2.  It's not that it was finished, or that it left you to make up your own ending, but it just ended without explanation it just died and went to a black hole.  To some degree that was the major flaw that went throughout the film.  It is a good insight into the mind of repression, but then what else can it say??

Huppert plays a spinster professor whose rage-fueled desire for control is equaled by her desire to be wholly dominated, at first by her mother (Girardot) and then her mother's surrogate, a young, cocksure student (Magimel). It's very intense stuff and, for a film with such distinguished performers as Huppert and Girardot, pretty explicit (there are pornographic images in a sex shop and the sexual encounters between Huppert and Magimel, though not graphic, appear in real time) which is definitely to the filmmaker's credit Haneke presents his material with a matter-of-fact approach that strips away all manner of pretension. He also carefully creates, late in the drama, some disturbingly ambiguous shifts in tone so that you're unsure how to interpret crucial, violent moments. (Words Huppert's character uses earlier are returned to her but her response to them is subtle and shaded.)  Yet when all is said and done there is less revealed about our penchant for domination and subjugation than about some cruel, ugly individuals that don't seem to be breathing the same air we do. It's based on a novel (by Elfriede Jelinek, unread by this reviewer) and the emphasis on abnormal thought processes suggests it might have been more insightful as a book.

I think it let me down more because it was supposed to be good and tasty, but it was not.Although the plotlines are different, this movie falls apart midway as Holy Smoke does. Both of them are apparently ambitious but halfway all ideas (At least those that make sense!) simply fade away, and the viewer is left to witness an hour or so full of absurd situations. Looks like the writers got tired at that point and started adding every stupid idea to the script (Or maybe they took some acid or something!). WARNING! - SPOILERS.La Pianiste's premise seems appealing, but once Erika (Isabelle Huppert's character) breaks loose the film goes nowhere and the action becomes strained. It's not the actress' fault (In fact, she does a great job) but the writers'. This film could have used a bit more of sensibility to approach the end with more believable situations, but instead the writers turn Erika into an impredictable and pathetic woman that lets all hell break loose after a self-restraint life. During the first hour or so, the movie is watchable. The main character is a harsh piano teacher that happens to live with her conservative and pain-in-the-ass mum. Unfortunately, after her first come-but-go sexual encounter with that man things go downhill pretty fast. Erika's character goes literally nuts, wanting him to recreate on her every degrading sexual fantasy she has seen or read about. Needless to say I am NOT a prude nor I am outraged by those fantasies, but all goes wrong since. Some of the scenes in her house the last time that bloke comes see her in the night are downright stupid and disgusting, if nothing else because they are unnecessary and don't fit. I guess you could say she finally gets what she deserves, but if I were that guy I could not slap her, no matter how wild she was driving me. This part of the movie I could do without, definitely. I was just not ready to see any physical abuse. And what the hell is the end supposed to mean? Her standing everyone up in the concert hall does make sense but, before that, what can we deduce from her stabbing herself under her left shoulder? Any ideas?It's real hard to rate this mess as it deserves. I'm gonna give it four out of ten because of the acting and the first hour. Otherwise it's a pointless movie you can only enjoy if you are stoned or drunk. "},{"Title":"Three talented actors wasted in a single film.

My expectations were not met as I was heavily disappointed with this film as primarily all the three French actors were not properly used. To begin with Isabelle Huppert is a big miscast as the cold,lonely music teacher.This role could have been nicely done by Hanna Schygulla. Why ? As a German actress she would have surely had better affinity with Michael Haneke who is an Austrian author.Even the role given to the veteran actress of the past Annie Girardot looks unconvincing as she never fits in such kind of troubled mother mold.The biggest error is related to Benoit Magimel's character. This is because he is more at home in demonstrating his acting talents related to psychological aspects of French films. As I have not read the books by Elfriede Jelinek,I don't think that it would be fair on my part to comment on the book's cinematographic adaptation.

Is Kohut a metaphor for nazi Austria? The remainder of the movie appears to be the product of a troubled mind with rather naive views on human feelings and emotions. The hapless viewer is asked to believe that two seemingly diverse, incompatible people will fall so deeply 'in love' (expressed with 'je t'aime') that they need to impetuously lower/raise some of their garments in public toilets and gymnasium store rooms to indulge in amateurish, not obviously enjoyable sex practices which one would have thought were confined to the under-15's.

With the piano teacher's sexual proclivities, the details are on parade, but without any illumination. The same seems to hold true for the reactions of her student. Nothing links his initial, quotidian responses to her weirdness with the escalating strangeness and violence in the latter parts of the film. As a whole, the film seems simply pornographic one is presented with a mass of strange personality traits laid out in explicit detail, but that's it.

I can see how you might be sucked in to thinking the latter was a good film if you hadn't encountered one in a while. But if you HAD seen anything good immediately beforehand you'd wonder how this obsessive bludgeoning of the viewer with acts of twisted nastiness could even be mistaken for good art. Isabelle Huppert's performance? Admittedly she does keep us watching, keep us following her to see where she'll go...Spoilers follow.We start by watching a piano teacher who's at once very good and very bad mercilessly cruel (in creative ways, so that nobody is ever really prepared) to her students, she holds a respected post because she is, after all, talented, and her insults are painful precisely because they're backed by knowledge and even, musically speaking, wisdom. Her cruelty is enough to make her a genuine monster, just as her mother's cruelty to to her is enough to make HER a genuine monster. Then, suddenly, we see her walk into a porno parlour, take in a hardcore flick, and sniff a tissue that had been soaked in some former male customer's semen; see her sneak up on and watch a couple having sex at a drive-in; see her masturbate a male student in the women's toilets at the conservatory, but refuse to let him finish... and it's all downhill from there. I'm thinking WHY are we seeing this? Almost every famous figure in history and, we must assume, in fiction as well, has his or her sexual secrets. Most are allowed to remain secret. Biographers and authors, if they are wise, will pass over these things in silence unless they have specific reason not to let these people have their privacy, for goodness sake.It's only towards the very end that we find that Haneke has decided to make the fetishes Erika Kohut pursues in her off hours when nobody's looking, part of the main show, because they afford him yet another opportunity to show us the virus of cruelty from Erika's mother, to Erika, spreading outwards further (well, to Water, who must have been especially susceptible to begin with; I trust most people would not behave so badly with so little provocation), every single interaction of any kind ending up as no more than another opportunity for one of the two parties to assault the other and Haneke to assault the audience. Yes, I get the point, whether because I worked it out myself or because I read it in other people's comments I'm not sure the music Erika plays so well speaks of a joy which she no longer knows how to navigate towards in her own life, and just as she's been blighted this way, she will in turn blight others. Well acted, Huppert; well said, Haneke, in a one-note kind of way (although please do note there's no particular reason, certainly no good reason, that your film as a whole should be as joyless or as merciless as its central character); but does this make for a decent film, one worth even the time spent watching it? Just recently I've seen the real thing, and I'm not fooled.The following is something of a cheap shot, since the flaw I'm picking up on is just the result of an almost ubiquitous convention, but I feel I'm justified under the circumstances in a film so determined to be unflinching, uncompromising and free of artifice, why is it that all conversations in Vienna are conducted in French? "},{"Title":"a few notches below the usual Michael Haneke production","Date":"26 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Michael Haneke is one of the most innovative filmmakers of these last years and he must be given credit to take contemporary cinema in new territories. In a handful of films all disturbing which shatter our consciences and with a recognizable trademark, he created his own universe, a formidable one in which it is dangerous to venture. Like the greatest auteur, Haneke has his set of themes. Most of his films revolve around the alienation of the individual in the current western world in which comfort and modernity can lead him to the loss of his identity, even his physical or psychological destruction (der Siebente Kontinente 1989 Benny's Video 1992). The way violence has become a common feature in everyday life in an insensible society (Funny Games 1997), absence of love and communication in a God-forsaken world are also recurrent witnesses which run throughout Haneke's work. It seems that his latest opus, CachÃ© (2005) is his most accomplished movie. It was a triumph on all levels and I have only read virtually unanimously glowing critics. It also garnered a bucketful of prizes and awards in Europe. Four years earlier, awards also rained on la Pianiste which like CachÃ© received paeans of praise... maybe wrongly from my own standpoint. Derived from a novel, I do not think that it is on a par with Haneke's previous works. It's a let-down after a so far immaculate career.Coming after the fragmented Code Inconnu RÃ©cits Incomplets De Divers Voyages (2000) which encompassed nearly all Haneke's quoted obsessions, la Pianiste is a return to a more accessible, linear form like Funny Games but once again not for all tastes given the murky even grisly contents of the film. But it's not necessarily a better one. A reading of the synopsis lets see why the director was highly interested with his topic a 45 year-old maid who is a piano teacher and who lives under under her possessive mother's thumb. She only finds as a way out to flee from her sultry household the outings in peep-shows and porn cinemas. The Austrian director studied psychology in Wien in the sixties so it seemed that the story of this neurotic upper-class person was tailor-made for him. It was apparently a perilous task to render this novel on the screen because from Haneke's own words, several passages came within pornography. But fortunately, these passages are very subdued when they are transfered on the screen.Haneke remains faithful to his hallmarks. Although his devotees will have perhaps noticed that his obsessions, here take a back seat except maybe in the sequences when Annie Girardot intervenes. Indeed, she spends most of her time glued in front of the telly, the telly, a cursed object in Herr Haneke's universe. Here, one could argue that the telly only contributes to cement Girardot's domination on her daughter. Haneke also uses his static, clinical style again to describe and assess in a hard-hitting way, the mournful, loveless life of Erika Kohut with sometimes evocative colors. The blood which flows in the bathroom after a scene of self-mutilation on her genital parts underscores Erika's psychological wounds.In a way, what makes the strength of the film also constitutes its main drawback. I'm far from being an expert at psychology but it seems incompatible to me that Erika can be a brilliant piano teacher while being systematically over-protected by her mother in spite of her key-sentence you must be the best piano teacher in the world my girl. Maybe would it have been more cohesive to introduce a character with a not so prestigious professional situation. But on the other hand, Erika's voyeuristic side and her secret attendances of porn cinemas seem logical with her persona and it's a neat idea from Haneke to have included classical music in the screening sessions. But the irregularity I mentioned handicaps a major part of the film and what doesn't help matters is that the second half which is more centered on the sadistic love affair between Erika and Walter (BenoÃ®t Magimel) is rather undermined by overlong sequences with some filler. Hence, this feeling that the film never seems to end.Part of the disappointment also comes from the cast. Maybe it was a mistake to have hired celebrities. In Haneke's previous pieces of works, actors were unknown of the mainstream (except maybe for the German and Austrian public) and contributed to the filmmaker's unique universe, even if Code Inconnu had Juliette Binoche. Hats off to Isabelle Huppert who agreed to play such a demeaning part. Anyway, she would act the same type of character with startling results in the highly superior 8 Femmes (2002) by FranÃ§ois Ozon. But Annie Girardot's part is underwritten. She didn't deserve her CÃ©sar in 2002. Haneke had thought of Jeanne Moreau for this part, I wonder what she would have done with it. Her possessive, pervasive presence isn't potent, destructive enough to give her the image of a monstrous mother. Worse, she's sometimes wasted in the way she's badly used. In one of the most famous images of the film, she's held by Huppert and Magimel as she's screaming. In the grievous scene, she's locked on a room and her cries make the moment unintentionally funny! As for BenoÃ®t Magimel, his persona doesn't articulate itself very well with the posh, cold universe in which the film bathes. His prize for best actor in Cannes in 2001 is very disputable.I don't want to slate Haneke's film. It's not a winner, neither is it a despicable work. I can't find in it the something which elevated the bulk of his work to undebatable heights.

Huppert's performance holds the film together, although Girardot is also very good as Erika's battle-axe mother. But for me, this film was way too slow. Very little happens for a long time and once the crunch scene appears, the film finally begins to tell its story. By the end, though, I was too confused - the ending felt too sudden, as the director got bored.

Maybe I was tired and only gave the film half my attention. But I'm not so sure. There is no denying that some scenes remain in the mind for a short while after the credits have rolled but the film dragged on for too long, stretching it's tale (and characters) beyond breaking point.

But then Michael Haneke decided to make La Pianiste, one of the dullest movies I've ever seen bad dialogue, lack of characterisation, characters acting out of character, a bad structure, and your typical ambiguous ending that can mean a million things but ultimately means nothing! I should have enjoyed La Pianiste on the surface, the main story is amazing; the exploration of a woman's repressed sexual life and the dark perversions that are born from it; the psychological exhaustion of leading such a life of loneliness without a soul-mate to share her fantasies; and the effects of her perverted fantasies on an innocent young man. I can just see David Lynch making a modern masterpiece out of this material. But in the hands of Haneke, with his poor execution of ideas, it's all dull and meandering and not as captivating as it seems.The protagonist, Erika, a repressed piano teacher, and her domineering mother are badly established at the start of the movie. For one thing, Haneke seems to know little about subtlety in his eagerness to show the conflicted relationship between Erika and her mother, he starts the movie with such an extreme situation it's almost ludicrous Erika comes home late, her mother enquires her whereabouts, the two argue and quickly engage in physical violence and name-calling. This could be a nice scene towards the end, but not in the beginning as Haneke forgets these two women who almost killed each right now are going to live together for another 120 minutes of the movie, and obviously it doesn't look realistic to have two people who hate themselves so much living so peacefully afterwards. Haneke should have started with a small incident and slowly raise the bar until culminating in a scene of physical violence. Because, in fiction, once you reach this point the logical step is to top it with murder. You don't just apologise your mother after hitting her in fiction&#133; that causes another problem Erika acts out of character; first she hits her mother, which is fine, but immediately apologises, thus taking two steps backwards from her initial characterisation. And how can it be that a grown up woman who hates her mother so takes her around everywhere? Their relationship does not convince me - I don't believe a grown up woman would act like this towards someone she hates; if Haneke had had the grace of showing it's impossible for her not to live without her mother, that'd have been fine, but it seems Erika could leave her mother's house at any moment but never does for no apparent reason.The whole movie is this melodramatic - the characters' actions just fluctuating as it pleases the film-maker, not because they'd actually act like this. The initial scene would have been better tied with the later one where Erika tries to have sex with her mother. This way Haneke could make another connection between love/sex/violence, which is a running theme throughout the movie. Even so, the scene where she tries to have sex with her mother stands out as a good one in itself - one really understands how Erika finally feels alone as her last hope, Walter, abandons her and she retreats to her source of hatred for consolation. Walter, one of her students, is a so-so character he's interesting at times, but unfortunately he's also poorly developed; the movie never convinces me enough that Erika's fantasies could have messed up his mind so much to the point of turning him into a rapist and woman-beater; the &#145;seduction of the innocent' theme is always an interesting one, but Haneke just didn't push it far enough, which is strange considering he was pretty uncompromising throughout the rest of the movie.Indeed, that's one of the things I appreciate in this movie - Haneke's uncompromising stab at Mankind's darkest side and the creation of very gruesome characters. Even so, this movie isn't as disturbing as hype would have one believe what passes for disturbing are really just great little touches Erika visiting porn booths to watch sex, later indulging in voyeurism and watching a real couple having sex in a car; her smelling tissue papers with semen; her writing long letters with her sick fantasies; her cutting her vagina with a blade&#133; those are all fine touches, which in the hands of a better film-maker would have turned La Pianiste into a masterful exploration of the human nature. The ambiguous ending shows Haneke didn't really know what he was doing with the movie, as a lack of resolution ends the movie in an unnecessary cliff-hanger. I suppose it's an end because nothing else comes after it, but it's not a resolution of the story in the sense Michael Corleone killing the five families of New York is a resolution to The Godfather, or the Photographer throwing the imaginary ball back to the mimes is a suitable resolution to Blowup. La Pianiste only has an end because it has nothing else afterwards, and it's a ridiculous one. This isn't a really bad movie, as it has great material, but quality is always in the execution of the ideas, and Haneke just didn't have the talent to pull it off.

It is really sad, because Isabelle Huppert's performance are excellent as a mature woman, still living with her mother, who can't get along with other people and secretly carries masochistic and submissive tendencies. She is convincing but it is painful how the plot goes nowhere. She never really change her way, barely when a young charming man, for obscure reasons fall for her character! I couldn't even care about her. She is cold and unlikeable and treat everyone she meets bad! And she isn't alone, almost everyone else are terrible people. I can't spot any good point to this un-moving story. Her masochism that could be interesting isn't even explored very well, but rather just appears to force it even more down the throat of the viewer that she is a sick woman. Unpleasant and terrible boring. But I bet it sells.

The first few minutes of the film reveal a deep emotional abyss between mother and daughter.  Nothing unusual there. Film follows life.  But wait!  Soon to follow is a smorgasbord of psychopathology to make the intergenerational conflict a love fest by comparison.Is there some connection between the beauty of the music played in short measures early in the film and the harrowing and degenerate behavior (yes, some behavior deserves that appellation) that follows?  As a lifelong music lover and concertgoer I couldn't find any.The best way to see The Piano Teacher is to bring a small flashlight and a copy of DSM-IV to the theater and then try to identify the various but many pathologies paraded on the screen.  This could be a fun game for a group of friends seeing the film together.The most amusing part of the evening was listening to folks leaving the theater.  Some tried - valiantly to be sure but not necessarily to their credit - to find depth and meaning in the cinematic depiction of characters needing commitment - not the relationship kind but that which follows a court proceeding.The New French Cinema?  Please.  "},{"Title":"sick","Date":"13 October 2001","Score":"8 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  This film is nothing else than disgusting pornography. This film will make you vomit. On one hand, Isabelle Huppert might be a great actress. But on the other hand, Hanneke is probabely the worst and incapable director of the past, present and futur of cinematographic art. This film is the combined result of two sick minds Hanneke's and Jelinek's. It's awful, it's dilletantic, it's bad, bad, bad. It's disgusting. It's sick. "}]
