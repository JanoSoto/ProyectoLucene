Travis back in her swinging youth was involved with all these guys and all stepped up to the plate. They've created a most unusual household.But Travis hasn't heard marriage from any of them and indeed why would she in this situation. So she's accepting the proposal of director Christopher Cazenove and is ready to move across the pond and do her acting career in the United Kingdom. That doesn't sit well with any of the guys, particularly the one that Travis was really waiting for a proposal from. Time to bust this situation up since Cazenove hasn't been truthful about a few things especially where the little lady is concerned.This film more than any other gives credence to Hillary Clinton's quoted African maxim that it takes a village to raise a child. Any more in that household you'd have a small village. If you liked the first film and the characters created you'll like this one.The man hungry Fiona Shaw, headmistress of a most strict boarding school in England has the best supporting performance. What she does to Tom Selleck almost makes it to rape.Three Men And A Little Lady should be pleasant viewing fare for fans of the three stars and Nancy Travis.

For the next four years, Mary learns to walk and talk and soon becomes a lovely 5-year-old girl; Peter is still an architect, Michael is still an artist, he's painted pictures on the walls and Jack is still an actor. Sylvia is still an actress and her director and fianceé, Edward, was asked to direct A Midsummer Night's Dream in England and he asked Sylvia to come along. But Sylvia was reluctant on leaving her friends; Peter, Michael, Jack and Sylvia try enrolling Mary in school. The board likes her but tell them that she's at an age where she'll begin to ask questions and may find having three dads odd. Over the next couple of days, Peter, Michael and Jack struggle with Mary  and Edward pops the question. Sylvia decrees she would be packing up her things along with Mary and be moving to London. Jack tried to stop her by asking her to marry him instead, after all, he was Mary's biological father. She declines. Secretly, Peter was in love with Sylvia but just didn't have the guts to tell her. Sylvia brings Edward over to meet the family and Peter doesn't like him.         The next day Sylvia and Mary leave for England, leaving Peter, Michael and Jack distraught. They throw a party to try and meet new people but it doesn't work out. Michael decrees that he wants to go to Sylvia's wedding so the next day while Jack heads to Brazil to film a movie, Peter and Michael go to England and drive to Sylvia's parents home in the countryside in a rented Mini. It turns out Edward isn't the kind, child-loving man he seemed to be. He shouted at Mary quite often. At a party, Edward introduced Peter to Elspeth Lomax, the headmistress of a boarding school for girls. Edward told Elspeth that he was in love with her so she tried to move in on her, but Peter really wasn't. Peter and Michael tour the boarding school and find it to be cold and unfeeling and the worst part was that Edward had enrolled Mary there next term! The school was really meant for children 8 and up and Mary was only 5! Peter and Michael race back and tell Sylvia what's up and she doesn't believe them. Jack arrives then and together, they make a plan.        That night, Peter heads to the school to find proof of Mary's enrollment. He runs into Elspeth, unfortunately. En route back, Peter's rental car breaks down. In the morning, the wedding was on! Michael delayed the preacher by accidentally driving him to a funeral! Peter got a lift from Elspeth but she didn't see that creek coming! So they borrow a motorcycle from a farmer. Jack dresses up as a preacher and performs a long ceremony. He finally declares Sylvia and Edward man and wife. Just then, Peter and Elspeth burst in and tell Sylvia what's up and she believes them! Jack reveals himself so they weren't really married. Sylvia declares the wedding off. Peter then tells Sylvia how he really feels for her and they fall in love and get married because Michael brought the real preacher in at that moment and they all live happily ever after.       I think this one was better than the original. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed Three Men and A Baby, but this one seems to have more to it. Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg and Ted Danson reprise their roles as Mary's honorary and biological fathers. Nancy Travis is back as Sylvia, who's really stuck up and annoying in this one!

We get to see where everyone from the first film is and how their life ends up and it was well written and worthy. It didn't feel just like a cash in which it probably was. The first film was more of a comedy than this sequel. Certainly there are still some funny moments but this one has much more drama and romance than the first and that's okay. It works very well and we needed more character development from the three Dad's and from Sylvia who gets a full character in this one. I felt like with the first movie it was just full of 80's clichés and popular culture and I couldn't help but notice that this movie didn't have that vibe. Granted the movie was made in 1990 which is outside of the 80's window but somehow I didn't feel like it had quite the style the first one had. I suppose, they made the movie under the pretense that everyone already knew the characters and they didn't need to rehash who they were and what they did for a living and that is probably a wise choice on their part.Tom Selleck, Steve Guttenberg, and Ted Danson are back and in full swing in their old roles. The three of them still have great chemistry and are a little older, a little wiser and a little more mature this time around. Their personalities aren't quite as vibrant as the first film but they are who they were the first time around and that is a compliment. They don't outdo each other and they are great together. Nancy Travis returns as Sylvia but as a main character. I can't figure out why they chose to make her English. Travis' accent is okay at best and its distracting. There is really no reason to make her British other than her return to England which they could have done easily in another way. Still she is good and has good chemistry with everyone. Robin Weisman, who never did much of anything else, is downright terrific as Mary. She's appropriately adorable and does a great job. Christopher Cazenove is our pseudo-villain looking to break up the beloved foursome. Cazenove is the perfect 80's comedy villain and he carries out his role very well.Taking over from Leonard Nimoy at the directing duties is the amazing Emile Ardolino. I say amazing in particular because of his duties directing the classic (one of my favourites) Dirty Dancing but also classic comedy Sister Act. He tells a great story and you can tell he wanted this to be much more than just a run of the mill sequel. It is fun and worthy and lives up the popularity of the first one. The two movies together make up a classic little series that must be seen. I for one would be thrilled to see them do a third part even more than twenty years later as long as they put as much work into it as they did the first two films. 7.5/10 "},{"Title":"A rather dull sequel to a rather dull movie","Date":"22 July 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" This movie is the sequel to 3 Men and a Baby which is based on a French Film. Unfortunately I have not seen the French film so I cannot comment on it, though I would like to. This movie is the sequel to the American version so I doubt that I can compare it with the original anyway. The baby girl has now grown up and they are looking to take her to a school. At this time she is having fun with three dads but when she gets to school she learns that this is not normal. It seems that this is going to be the plot, with her trying to adapt to the social norm when she does not fall into it, but this is not the case. Rather her mother decides that she needs to marry and they guy, Tom Sellick, whom she wants to marry seems to be more interested in the girl than her so she goes after a wealthy director who lives in England. At first the director seems to be a nice guy but we learn that he is really a creep and this comes to revelation when he secretly sends the girl to a harsh boarding school. Thus the three men but prove to the woman that he really is a creep. This movie is not really a thematic movie but it is still enjoyable. There are two quite funny characters, the butler and the substitute vicar that makes a joke out of senility. Yet a theme does exist in the movie and that is that a child needs a mother and a father. Sending children to a private school is not really appropriate if it is simply to get them out of the way. Sometimes it is not possible to have the children attend school, especially if the child lives in the country and finds it difficult to attend school every day, so a boarding school is appropriate. Unfortunately people use such schools as a way to get their children out of their hair, which is what I feel is quite inappropriate. Marriage implies that the partners take upon each other's burdens. If one partner has a child then when you marry the woman you take the child as your own. It is not appropriate to marry then send the child away, especially without informing the mother. This is why Sellick was the much better father, but he focused on the girl and not the mother, which is what upset the mother. Yet it is revealed later that he did love the mother but was too shy to reveal this. Instead he hid behind the child so that he did not need to expose himself. I did not find the movie all that bad, though the critics scathed it. I disagree. Though it was clichéd in a lot of places, it was still quite a good movie.

What do those guys think we do here in the UK all day, bumble about in wooden cars around country lanes?This film is just utter tripe and a serious insult to the English. If you've never been to the UK it is NOTHING like this film shows it. OK, so film makers have a certain amount of artistic license, but this is really too bad altogether. It would be the same as showing the US populated wholly by overweight burger chomping rednecks. But it isn't, is it.Watch something else and do yourself a favour.

"},{"Title":"Disappointing Follow-Up To The First Movie","Date":"21 October 2008","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Family","Review":" After the massive worldwide success of Three Men and a Baby in 1984, a sequel was launched 7 years later with Ted Danson, Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg all reprising their roles as Jack, Peter and Michael and a slightly grown up Mary tagging along for the ride.In this sequel, Mary's biological English mother, Sylvia- played by American actress Nancy Travis decide to move to 'merry old England' and start a new life. Her London/English accent sounded a bit bizarre ; when I first saw this film, I'd thought she was English. However, I think it would have made much more sense if the casting directors had opted to hire an 'English' born actress for the role of Silvia instead.On the way, Sylvia's charm and beauty attracts the attention of fellow Englishman, Christopher Casonove (Note I use the term English as opposed to British here, in an attempt to dispel any confusion and to say that 'Britain' is made up of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Later on, Peter suddenly develops feelings for Sylvia and when he finds out she is going to marry her English boyfriend, he, alongside Jack and Michael fly to England to stop Sylvia from proposing to him.The film is set within the English countryside backdrop (according to this site, it says it was filmed in Oxfordshire), and so rather you only get a glimpse of one part of English culture and not the rest, which is unfortunate. Many American and overseas films and TV shows in their portrayal of British/English culture and the people, have a habit in depicting British people as either upper- class snobs speaking with posh accents or the Queen's English for instance, or with Dick-Van Dyke, 'Oliver' Cockney London accents.I think this is partly because people outside the UK view the nation as being nothing more than London itself- which is a problem and many of them are unaware of the different accents and regions that exist in and around the UK, such as Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham, Newcastle, Edinburgh, Cardiff etc. Also people confuse England with Britain, which coincidently, is not the same thing. The lack of Media representation of these cities and its people to the wider world in both TV and film needs to addressed, if we are to get beyond the 'geezer' and 'maa'm' stereotypes.Apart from the much stereotypical portrayal of us Brits, Three Men and a Little Lady, is in itself, a lacklustre sequel to what was, in my view, a very good movie, first time round. It is very sickly sweet in most places, some of the jokes are quite flat as well and it is a bit too 'hammy' for my liking. For a so-called light- hearted movie, there are less laughs to be found and the plot and narrative is all-too predictable that you'd be able to figure out what is going to happen in the end.The soundtrack is great though; Boy Meets Girl's worldwide smash- hit of 89','Waiting for a Star to fall' is still one of the most infectious-yet equally memorable movie songs of all-time.Overall, Three Men and a Little Lady is a disappointment; well I didn't really like it that much, but if you liked the first movie so much, then give this one a spin. Otherwise, there are better family films on the market, which whilst a lot of them aren't as similar to 'Three Men and a Little Lady'- plot-wise, they offer a lot more for your money, in contrast.

I love how the movie always centers around Mary that makes me feel that something important was shown about how precious children are in this world.  I know this very well because I worked with children for seven years and all my little cousins have told me that I'm their favorite cousin.  The movie may not be a masterpiece but it sure gives us, an important message to think about, as well as a big smile at the end of the movie and the same goes for the first movie.  I too love Ted Danson catching the bouquet at the end right when Waiting For A Star To Fall begins a perfect ending in my opinion.  The last scene with Ted Danson catching the bouqet with the slow motion effect with Boy Meets Girl's big hit beginning is a scene that has a bigger definition than what is within the context of the movie.  It is symbolic of Danson's career with Cheers and what was going on in that show at the time.  It was a hint that a storyline could develop about Sam and Rebecca possibly marrying each other on Cheers, as we all know that did not happen but the last scene of this movie was jokingly just giving us a possible storyline for Cheers (think about the facial expression Ted makes when he catches the bouquet and you'll clearly see what I am talking about).  I found this little tidbit out a long time ago from one of the writers of the film who I happen to know.  To sum up I would just like to say thank you to Emile Ardolino for directing a great film and thank you to Boy Meets Girl for creating a wonderful song for this movie!

He gave a remarkable performance in Barry Levinson's Diner - then he resorted to kiddie trash like these films.If you liked the first, you'll probably like this. It's more of the same - three klutzes taking care of a baby (now a young girl) go through tough times trying to adjust. Here, they try to keep her mother away from marrying some bad evil guy. Woefully painful (and offensive) British stereotypes are made and the jokes are intolerable.This is one of the best cases of a franchise cash-in - a surprising little gem is found (albeit a pretty poor one) by audiences, makes millions of dollars, and studio bosses who didn't want to make the original in the first place jump on the bandwagon and start investing money into a sequel - which flops and ruins the reputation of the first. (Also see Ocean's Twelve, which is currently receiving negative reviews and turning off fans of the original. Yikes!)

I actually felt rather sick and extremely nauseated by it. I can't actually decide if this film is an outrageously poor attempt at humour or weather it is simply a prolonged attack against the people of Britain. Many American films are guilty of portraying the British as upper class morons, but this film really tries hard to make us look like the most idiotic, brain dead, arrogant, stuck up, pompous creatures that infest this planet. I don't know if the makers expected the film to go down very well on this side of the Atlantic, but I for one found it more than disagreeable. Apart from the obvious stereotyping of British people, this film is truly dreadful. A very poor sequel to a very poor original. I really can't say any more about it because thinking about it is bringing my nausea back on.

It's called 'Mary Hates America'.  It goes like this  Mary moves back to New York and in year 2000 realises that she is living in a nation of gun-packing, drug addict, badly educated morons who do nothing but watch TV and shoot each other all day.  Sick of hanging around with badly dressed overweight rednecks, racists, geeks and people who think 'awesome' is a considered reply, she moves back to London,and gets a great job in the fashion industry.  Michael, Jack and Peter come back to England to rescue her again, but are beaten to death by British Immigration at Heathrow for asking where they can rent a Mini at the airport.  The film ends with the entire eastern Seabord of the United States being nuked by Royal Navy trident submarines for no particular reason, other than it being funny.I think that would just about redress the stereotype balance between the two countries as established by Three Men and a little Lady.Have a nice day.

Basically Peter 'Pete' Mitchell (Tom Selleck), Michael 'Mike' Kellam (Steve Guttenberg) and Jack Holden (Ted Danson) are still living with Sylvia Bennington (Nancy Travis, with a little more believable English accent) and the daughter she and Jack had, now grown-up Mary (Robin Weisman). This story sees Sylvia's work making her move back to England, while Pete and Mike follow Jack is filming. The boys, especially Pete who eventually realises he loves Sylvia, are trying to make sure not only Mary has a good school, not boarding, and towards the end stop Sylvia's wedding to some bozo. Also starring Christopher Cazenove as Edward Hargreave, Sheila Hancock as Vera Bennington, Harry Potter's Fiona Shaw as Miss Elspeth Lomax, John Boswall as Barrow, Edward's Butler and Jonathan Lynn as Vicar Hewitt. To be honest, only the opening montage and music, and the only funny moment of the film when Jack is disguised with great make-up as a vicar, these are the only worthwhile parts. If you liked the first film, I would insist you don't bother with this nonsense, a terrible comedy sequel. Pretty poor!
