[{"Title":"The Double Life of Demi","Date":"15 August 2001","Score":"21 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":" Surprisingly absorbing film that requires your patience (to let it unfold) and your attention (to capture all the nuances, and they are there). Demi Moore (looking angular and pale like Courteney Cox-Arquette, yet more flexible) is very fine as a woman living parallel lives, one of which is a dream-world. She's a widowed book reviewer in France with two kids and also a literary businesswoman in New York City. Complicating matters are two separate lovers (and shrinks!) who all say that the OTHER life she's having is a dream. Plot is laid out in elementary terms (with some nice surreal edges there at the finale) and I found it a pleasant, intriguing bit of fantasy, quite romantic in its melodrama. And for the poster who hated this on both plane flights he saw it on, heads up most films look bad on planes. *** from **** "},{"Title":"Misguided presentation of an interesting psychodrama","Date":"29 September 2000","Score":"20 out of 23 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  How much one enjoys this film depends greatly on how much of Demi Moore you can stand.  If you like long drawn out schmaltzy romances with Demi as the romantic heroine, you will love this film times two.  Otherwise, hide any weapons lest you begin attacking your screen.This film was toasted by the critics, but I didn't think it was that bad.  In fact, I liked it.  I guess I fall more into the first (sucker for schmaltz) category.  The story was criticized as being a contrived version of `Me, Myself and I', where a woman is torn over the choice between life as a professional and the family shtick.  That criticism really misses the point.  This is a story about a woman's psychological attempt to deal with her traumatic past and has nothing whatever to do with lifestyle choices.I found this to be an intelligent and complex character study of a woman who seems to be two people living two lives, but really isn't.  If that seems cryptic, see the film and it might become clearer.  When she goes to sleep from her life with her children in France, she wakes up to her high-powered career in New York and vice versa.  She can't determine which is real and which is a fantasy.  She has a lover in each life and both seem very real to her.  As the story unfolds, she and we try to figure out which is her real life and which is the dream.The trouble with the presentation is that its real intrigue lies with the psychodrama.  Unfortunately, neophyte director Alain Berliner pushed that element to the background and cranked up the schmaltz machine, centering the story on the romances instead.  That wouldn't have been so bad if they weren't so interminable.  Scene after scene retraced the same romantic theme, until it became frayed.  Other than the misplaced emphasis, the film was well crafted.  There were subtle hints throughout about which was the real life, but they were far from obvious tip-offs.  However, when we finally discover the truth, it takes forever to wrap up the loose ends.  To Berliner's credit, the locations were breathtaking, in both France and New York.  It is easy to find beauty in the French countryside, but these were some of the most wonderful film perspectives I have ever seen of New York's skyline and street vistas.After enjoying a few years as one of the highest paid entertainers on the planet, Demi Moore disappeared for three years.  This was probably not the best vehicle for her return.  Her performance was strongly emotional but one-dimensional, failing to differentiate the characters sufficiently.  She played the high-powered NYC girl to be just as wimpy as the insecure girl in France.  To be fair however, she created two very appealing and vulnerable romantic characters and deserved better notices than she received.William Fichtner was not the greatest choice for her NY love interest.  Fichtner is better at abrasive antagonist roles and his attempts at sensitivity came across as far too pathetic.  Stellan Skarsgard was much better and made a dashing and attractive romantic figure.This was a good story that took a sentimental detour under the guidance of an inexperienced director.  Still, it was engrossing and even touching at times.  I rated it a 7/10.  Add a point if you like sentimental pieces and subtract at least two if you aren't a Demi Moore fan.

The double life is so effectively convincing that she can't tell which of the lives is real and which is the dream. On top of this, she has romantic interests in both lives, a controlling and passionate writer in France (Stellan Skarsgard), and a giving and kind man in New York (William Fichtner, his best performance yet). Moore's fascinating screen presence keeps this movie going even when it sags terribly in the middle, and Ronald Bass' script makes such a compelling argument for both of her lives that it's very difficult to guess for yourself what the outcome will be. The film's conclusion is so well played out and rewarding that it renders any previous flaws completely void. Also features a rich performance by Sinead Cusack.

Yes the movie is sometimes difficult to follow for rational minds, but the final moments bring it all together. You may not like it from a rational standpoint, but from an emotional one, if you have found in a stituation someday where you've had to relive, accept and say goodbye to your past in order to really appreciate your present, then emotionally, you will understand and appreciate it. Demi Moore delivers a subtle and wonderful performance. I miss her.

Her dilema is this, she has two very real existences, one in New York as a high-powered professional, the other in France as a widow with two children. However, one of them is a dream and she doesn't know which. Neither do we. When she sleeps in one existence, she is awake in the other. In both she has a psychiatrist who assures her the other existence is a dream, and in each she has a new beau who is falling in love with her.  In the end we find that the French existence is really a dream, taking her back to her childhood there. She had never reconciled the premature death of her mother, and in her dream she became the mother, the two children were her at different ages. A fine, entertaining, thought-provoking film. Most of the critics, like Ebert, got this one wrong. It is better than they said it was, probably because they decided early into the film that it wasn't good.   "},{"Title":"What a great surprise ! And i didn´t even knew this movie existed !","Date":"20 March 2002","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  I never knew this film even existed untill about a week ago. I saw it on sale at a supermarket and i was intrigued by the synopsis of the story at the back cover. I love this type of stories about paralel universes but i was not sure that a story like this could work properly as a serious romantic drama. Particulary one made-in-Hollywood. Basicaly i feared that this was another comercial sugar coated Jennifer Lopez-Julia Roberts comercial movie. I was wrong. I rented this movie totaly convinced that it was going to be bad, but, after the movie ended, i went back to the supermarket and i bought a copy for myself ! PASSION OF MIND was a real surprise to me. I´ve been reading plenty of bad reviews about it after i´ve seen it, and i can´t disagree more with them. I guess most people don´t realy get it´s idea and so rather than thinking about it, they decided the movie sucks. Possibly because it doesn´t follow that usual love-story comercial crap that make Hollywood´s so called romantic movies, most people don´t like it, because this PASSION OF MIND is a movie where you have to think along and you don´t have everything totaly explained all the time. But above all it´s an original movie, and a very good diferent aproach to a romantic story without making it look plastic.What stroke me first was the incredible cinematography. I never before seen New York filmed in such a beautiful way. The exterior locations looked trully beautiful and it´s a real viewing pleasure just to see a good story set against such beautiful images in the background. As for the plot, i think it´s a brilliant concept and a very inteligent way of telling a romantic story. Ok it might not be the most original one if you read a lot of sci-fi novels, but in this case it was extremely well presented, with never a dull moment despite the slow pace the story moves along. A great for story for people who like sci-fi themes and for people who don´t. Great script, good dialogue, good ending and it keeps its mistery right up untill the end ,without giving much away through out the whole film, making us stay glued to the tv set untill the movie finaly ends. (The region 2 dvd, has an incredible image and a fantastic 5.1 sound mix wich fills the room with a perfect 3d atmosphere)If you like stories about paralel realities, and you like this sort of existencial themes and hipotesis, you´re going to love this movie. As someone said in a review back here somewhere, this is a real good quantum mechanics movie, wich depicts very well some of the concepts present in those theories without complicating things for the viewer. Above all it makes us think and wonder. It´s a great movie to initiate a discussion about the theme afterwards and a very inteligent and beautiful romantic story. Pretty impressive actualy. As i said, a real good surprise. If you like originality, watch this. If you only like guns, explosions and special effects, stay away because you won´t get it. PASSION OF MIND is trully an execelent surprise.

Jane) is torn between reality and a dream.  When we first meet her she is Marie a mother of two daughters living in the French country side and reviewing books for a stateside paper. She lives as a recluse, pretty much, except for a friend (Sinead Cusack) who helps her deal with personal problems, including the death of her husband.  We assume that Marie has some deep emotional problems but it isn't until she goes to sleep that we find out just how deep those problems are.  You see, when Marie goes to sleep she dreams she is Marty,  a New York literary agent.   Marty is single and very independent.  She has no children and is very passionate about her work.  Marty has no time for relationships and keeps everyone at a safe distance emotionally.  But,  you can see in her face that she to has a secret.  Yes, that's right when Marty goes to sleep at night she dreams she is Marie.  Both Marie and Marty are fully aware of the other but neither knows which is dream and which is reality.It is here that the story starts to get interesting.  Marie meets William (Stellan Skarsgard,) an author whose book Marie panned.  William, almost stalking, shows up one day and befriends one of Maries daughters and eventually works his way into Maries heart. Meanwhile,  Marty encounters Aaron (William Fichtner,) an accountant doing business with her firm,  who has an immediate attraction to her.  And, just like Marie, Marty begins to have feelings for Aaron.Marie and Marty begin to realize they are in love.  But, which one is real? In both lives there are therapists trying to help solve this very problem.  Both Marie and Marty can feel each other's love.  We, as the viewer, feel it too!  Neither woman allows their respective men to get too close, believing something bad may happen if either of them are awakened in the middle of the night.  Both women realize that their relationships cannot last like this.  They must figure out which is reality and which is dream.  If they make the wrong decision all could be lost.   We try to decide, as well, which is real and which is dream.  It's not until we start to unlock the past that we find out if we have made the right decision.The writers (Ron Bass and David Field,)  do a great job using the dream world to show how some people deal with traumatic events in their past by suppressing them into their subconscious.  Everyone and everything in the dream life represents something significant in the real life past.  The cinematography is also wonderful.  Eduardo Serra (What Dreams May Come, The Wings of The Dove) shoots the French scenery marvelously making it seem very tranquil, while giving Manhattan a dark, cold and very overwhelming feeling.  The director, Berliner,  then takes this material and crafts it into a tale of duality, where one woman locks her feelings deep in her own mind and takes them out only in the privacy of her dreams.

Set in both New York and Paris, Demi Moore portrays a woman who is caught between lives--or is she? Is it all a dream, or does she live in two completely different worlds, 3000 miles apart from one another? This psychological romantic thriller is not about car chases, or exploding bombs, or psycho killers...but more about the power of the mind. A little slow to start, the movie picks up towards the middle and has some moments that tug at heart-strings. Good romantic movie, maybe a tear-jerker, and a surprise ending.

I've seen many of her movies, and only one of them really stands out to me as one that's worth watching more than once, and that's A Few Good Men - but it's worth watching for Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson. Demi is basically window-dressing there.Passion of Mind is typical Demi stuff. She has a troubled life as Marie/Marty - troubled because she isn't sure which one she really is; one life is a dream, the other reality. As Marie, she's a mother of two in France, as Marty she's a high powered literary agent in New York. Then in both lives she falls in love in France with William (Stellan Skarsgård) and in New York with Aaron (William Fichtner.) The movie at times is confusing as she shifts from one life to another (which is all right, because it surely points to the confusion she has herself in trying to sort out reality from fantasy) and although there are hints from the very beginning as to which life is real (I took a guess that turned out to be right almost right away, but it was a guess) it does remain a mystery until the end. The last fifteen minutes or so of the movie add the needed emotional heart-wrencher as she says good-bye to those in her fantasy world and prepares for life in reality.All fine. The primary problem with the movie is that Demi is living out two lives, neither one of which - quite honestly - are all that interesting, and which, as a result, don't make for particularly interesting viewing. In the end, this is a pretty standard Demi Moore movie.

Mental illness remains one of the few stigmatized conditions, and multiple personality disorder (MPD) may be the most stigmatized (and misunderstood) of all mental illnesses, perhaps because we're all so afraid of the disintegration of the personality. But Demi smashes the stereotypes, portraying a character who's a successful career woman despite her trauma-induced MPD, who faces her illness at times with soul-chilling fear but at other times with good humor, and who finally (with the help of a loving and supportive friend and ally) lovingly integrates these multiples into herself.The entire cast of PASSION OF MIND is superb, but Demi is absolute perfection and I'm not sure of anyone else who could have pulled this one off. It's not just a case of having to portray two different characters (personalities) but having to switch from her character's stiff upper lip into fear and uncertainty, then into humorous self-mockery, then into tender affection. And the closing scenes, as her character finally integrates her multiple selves, are a very sweet, tender, loving, and most of all realistic portrayal of MPD integration that's in no way sensationalized.A perfect performance by Demi in a perfect movie!

If you like seeing Demi Moore in a double role, Stellan Skarsgard in a romantic role, and William Fichtner in a more substantial role opposite a leading lady, and you long for provincial and natural sceneries of France, and love New York City's Central Park, then give PASSION OF MIND a chance.If seeing double role is what you're after, the Australian offering by writer-director Philippa Karmel ME MYSELF I with Rachel Griffiths is a more fun and down to earth depiction of the struggles of a young woman who turned thirty, having an identity crisis and wishing/dreaming she were with the man she had a crush on back in college days. Hence forth the rest of the movie/story showing us the other aspect of what Rachel Griffiths character's other life could have been. Deeper meaning of life revealed and renewal of a positive approach in living began as she ends her vacillating doubting identity crisis. Rachel Griffiths shines beyond Hilary & Jackie.

The story seems very interesting and Demi IS a good actress. Let 's hope, that this is the comeback of Demi, who we loved some years ago for her braveness playing the roles no one other would have played.

What first looks like a boring two-sided love story slowly reveals itself as a shallow but poetic reflection on the particularities of an unusual life and the difficulties embodied in it for both the heroin and its siblings. Difficulties which put her on a journey of questions and facts with the ultimate goal to put and end to it all. Subtile jokes here and there, nothing wrong but nothing deep about this movie, hints too big to be missed only to leave you with little satisfaction of being right when time comes and not worth much discussing with friends after it. Something to watch (and at least not too boring) with your mother, a thing made easier with Demi Moore appearance; A good romance for those mothers to watch with their good sons. "},{"Title":"Hollow.","Date":"8 June 2004","Score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  Although the premise is far from original (like someone else already said, it had been used only two years earlier by Raoul Ruiz in a film called Shattered Image), it is certainly interesting. It's the kind of premise that makes you want to see a movie, and that keeps you watching it all the way to the end. The film itself is dull, however. The filmmakers have chosen to de-emphasize the mystery/fantasy aspects of the story, and to emphasize the romantic aspect. But for all the time that is devoted to them, both romances that Demi gets involved in are pretty hollow, and visually the film is much less inventive than Shattered Image. Eventually the truth is revealed, but even that is done in a most anti-climactic manner.

I had to force myself to sit through it. I didn't even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me.The magical realism was completely missing because Demi Moore was grim and the lovers she was two-timing were guys who usually play villains, though each was kind of sexy and appealing.There was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives, with a distasteful frisson of The Elektra Complex; maybe the magic shouldn't be explained for this genre to work.(originally written 5/28/2000) "},{"Title":"The Less of Moore","Date":"27 April 2004","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","Review":"  PASSION OF MIND (2000) *  Demi Moore, Stellan Skarsgard, William Fichtner, Sinead Cusack,Peter Riegert, Gerry Bamman, Julianne Nicholson.   Dreadful romantic fantasy with echoes of  Richard Matheson and `Sliding Doors' with Moore as a womanwho suspects she's living two simultaneous lives in a  dreamscape.  Lugubrious and plodding with a laughable scriptand overtly heartfelt `acting'.  Easily the worst film in Moore'scanon.

Marty Literary agent. Makes 6-figure salary. Lives in an upscale Manhattan penthouse. Easy for her to read several hundred manuscripts and fall asleep at her desk for some highly suggested nocturnal escapism. Or perhaps stepping through an interdiemsional portal? She has the career, the looks, a cool car, a great pad, now where are the man and kids? In steps our boy Aaron- some real escapism. What are architects? They're artists who can do math, dreamers that make real money. Aaron gives Marty the dream of security and fills a void where she, obviously has no self confidence.On the other side of the coin, there's Marie, still living out her schoolgirl fantasies while she muddles through motherhood. Her children are her career and life. But what about Marie, does she only exist through her children? In waltzes William, a Parisian stranger who helps her focus on the one thing she has lost touch with herself.A supposed journey of self-discovery and late a coming of age thrown in some with angst and some resentment to Marty/Marie's own mother. This gets a 3/10. All I could say is thank God for the BPL multimedia division, I wouldn't waste my $2.99 at Blockbuster on this, put it toward a Harlequin Blaze title.

An interesting idea badly executed. And, for that matter, badly acted. Demi Moore is very good at curling her lip and smoking cigarettes, but is that all she does? And why so many cigarettes. Did Ligitt and Myers or one of the other bad boys of nicotine have some of their illicit profits invested in this production. It's confusing, silly and moves at the frantic past of a arthritic earthworm. I gave it a 3. Should have been a 2! "}]
