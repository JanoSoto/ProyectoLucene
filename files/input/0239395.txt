Other than that, it is a very entertaining film even with a bunch of silliness.Check the cast out. How often to you see Susan Sarandon and Charleton Heston in the same movie.

The plot delivers what it has - a little silly but quite clever in places - but the comedy is seriously lacking for adults.  For children there are some fart jokes and plenty of cat and dog slapstick but there are almost no jokes for adults that other films such as Shrek and Toy Story had in spades.Given the cast this is very surprising - Jon Lovitz is a great voice but is hardly used at all, the character of Mr Tinkles could have been a great Dr Evil character, but even he is wasted.  This is a great shame as all good children's films need to have something for adults to enjoy again.  The great cast (Maguire, Baldwin, Clarke Duncan, Sarandon, Pantoliano, Charlton Heston, Lovitz) is a good draw for adults but having almost nothing to deliver for them is a big disappointment.

That's a pretty weak concept for a bid-budget, special effects action film, especially when the production features the best technology has to offer. The movie uses more than 800 visual effects, and 200 animators, designers, compositors, sculptors, and technicians. With so much going for it, Cats & Dogs should have utilized these tools to bring a great story to life. It does breathe life into a plot filled with energy and gusto, but it sure isn't great. Unbeknownst to humans, cats and dogs have always fought for world domination. A power-hungry Persian cat, Mr. Tinkles (wonderfully voiced by Sean Hayes), has broken a truce between the species. He plans to lead an attack against man's best friend. Jeff Goldblum stars as Professor Brody, a scientist allergic to dogs. He conducts experiments in the basement of his house, hoping to invent a cure for man's allergic reaction to dogs. Mr. Tinkles designates the Brody home as ground zero for his global battle plan.Initially, the folks at Warner Bros. considered doing the film as an animated feature, but they finally decided on a combination of live action, cutting-edge technology, complicated puppetry, and computer animation.The results are splendid. Each animal has their own vivid personality, complete with facial expressions and physical gestures. The special effects do not overwhelm the film. Lawrence Guterman, the film's director, doesn't exploit the amazing special effects, but focuses on creating believable animal characters. Sadly, however, the sight of a talking cat eventually wears off, and that leaves Cats & Dogs with little interest. It might entertain children with high energy action and talking animals, but a movie cannot run on those things alone. Perhaps the film could have worked as a comedy, but it lacks any form of wit or impulse. Cats & Dogs thinks its concepts are funny and entertaining enough, which is probably why it puts so little thought into the story.

I will admit it I think kids will enjoy it more than adults, but it is fun. It has a silly but clever plot, a commendable voice cast and some decent acting in the human cast. While there are some funny moments, there are some parts in the middle half that are lacking slightly in comedy, and the script is a tad weak in parts. Despite the film's short length, it goes along at a swift pace, and the characters are at least likable. I have to say Lou(voiced with earnest conviction by Tobey Maguire) is adorable for a dog, and while you certainly don't want to mess with villainous feline Mr Tinkles (Sean Hayes seems to having a whale of a time here), though he is cute to look at. I have to say I think the best lines came from Mr Tinkles, they were often hysterical. As I said, the voice cast do a commendable job with the material they are given, and Jeff Goldblum and Elizabeth Perkins turn in decent human performances as well. The technical aspects are very well done indeed, and the music is good. Laurence Guterman does well directing, better than he did in the dreadful Son of the Mask four years later. All in all, not perfect, but it is cute and has a great concept.

Until one day Lou the Beagle puppy arrives on the scene.Set around the game of espionage, with similar themes to Mission Impossible, James Bond and to a great extent Austin Powers; Cats and Dogs animates the spy game with great bravado and even greater humour. This is a stylish and extremely witty parody that has the cat world fighting for world domination and to see dogs put in their place, outside in the doghouse, where humans would, as is the cat's goal, be allergic to the canine breed and thus welcoming the feline race into their homes.This is a high octane fun and friendly family movie that is built around the life of young Scotty (Alexander Pollock) and his scientist father (Jeff Goldblum) who whilst working too hard at trying to make a breakthrough for a cure to prevent dog allergies in humans. Unaware of his neglect, young Scotty, as too his parents, is completely oblivious to the fact that the parallel world that revolves around them is in great danger of crossing the divide of talking animals and dumb humans.Cats and Dogs is more than puppets meet Muppets; it is more than that, even though just as entertaining, it has progressed to greater levels. If you want to see Mr. Tinkles, the white Persian, that strangely resembles the white cat seen in the Bond and Austin Powers movies, giving his orders, over a grand table and log fire in his mansion. If you want to see secret agent dogs fighting Devon Rex's ninja style, a knife throwing Russian Blue hair-balling big style and a gigantic army of mice reading an instruction manual, all at once, on how to concur the world then this is the movie for you.With an intelligent and comical script, good sets and capable staff, such as Tobey Maguire, Alec Baldwin, Jon Lovitz, Michael Clark Duncan, Susan Sarandon and the great cinema legend Charlton Heston in the limelight, some very good special effects and plenty of spills and action, you really cannot go wrong.This is your typical laugh a minute family day in at the movies, and whichever side you cheer for, you are always guaranteed to end up stroking that funny bone until well after your sides ache.

The espionage war between the cats and the dogs was an inspired, if not so original idea, and the fight scenes were hugely amusing - the ninja cats had me in stitches, to say the least. The way Mr. Tinkles suddenly finds a way to make his plan succeed is a little rushed - how did the fainting of his owner suddenly change everything? There are several plot holes in this film, and a little more explanation wouldn't have done harm. But this film didn't try to be intelligent or gripping - it's basically the Cold War with pets for most of the film, but with a climactic finish in which everything is suddenly resolved and all the baddies are ruined. Even if it is not a corkingly intelligent piece of cinema, it sure is an amusing one, and it isn't badly done either. In fact, the climactic finish is brilliantly done and very amusing - machine guns are replaced by spraying machines, and bombs are replaced by spraying machines too (you'll see what I mean). It stays funny throughout, and it is amusing to see how all of the espionage happens behind all the humans' backs.

But I'm glad I did so anyway.Admittedly, a spy film about talking cats and dogs is likely not going to be the best in cinematography since Casablanca, but for its intended audience it's a very funny and well-made film.The star of the film is Mr. Tinkles, a beautiful and megalomaniac white Persian cat, who wants to take over the world. Not coincidently, it's exactly the same cat that Blofeld from the Bond movies had on his lap. And there are more clever hints at Bond movies.Mr. Tinkles is hilarious as an arrogant and aristocratic feline. A comment I've read is that the film is anti-cat biased, because of the way how cats are portrayed. As a matter of fact, the only real Bad Cat is Mr. Tinkles, whereas the others are merely his henchcats. I'm a cat lover, and quite frankly I'm inclined support the opinion that, from a cat's point of view, we're merely there to serve them. In my day-to-day contact with our two cats, I've found that they can be bad-tempered, and even outright vile.The only real let-down of this film is the sub-plot of the father doesn't pay enough attention to his son kind, which we've seen too often before. Because of this and the sentimentality surrounding the puppy, it balances somewhere between a children's film and a more regular one.If you want to see a no-brainer film which is still funny and cute, and too which you can take your children, I would definitely recommend this one.

I do find it odd, as one friend points out, I hate pretty much the majority of animal-talking movies whether CGI-crammed or simple mouths moving to the lame voiceovers and yet, I throw a curveball and love this movie.Perhaps because it was so damned funny, creative and inventive. Maybe because it was a versus movie and they took the lead by telling the audience who to root for instead of alternating between the pros/cons of the different sides. Or, possibly because it was clever &#x96; for the animals, using their strengths, weaknesses and limitations to the movie maker's advantage. For example, two of my favorite scenes involve the back-flipping and in the background ninja cats and one dogs paws flying over a keyboard.The film's weakness was, as always, the human counterparts. As much as I like Jeff Goldblum and as much as he tried, he was annoying as crud. (This also applies to the kid (Pollock) and Mom (Perkins.)) I see the dad (Goldblum) as attempting to channel the good ole Doc Brown (Lloyd, from Back to the Future) but failing miserably. No, the real stars were the animals.I liked the majority of the animals, like the already mentioned ninjas but also the Dobermans, including and especially their offspring. Also, Hayes as the main baddie, lead cat, Mr. Tinkles, stole the movie for the most part, though I believe they could've gone a little further. Russian Blue (Ficarra) was a hilarious prelude to Shrek 2's Puss in Boots and had me rolling as did Mr. Tinkles Smithers-wannabe sidekick.The basic plot line is Mr. Tinkles' vision of world domination, a la Brain from the Pinky & the Brain, but he's hunkered down by morons and insufficient spy cats. Meanwhile, newcomer and mistaken spy dog, Lou (Maguire), needs some encouragement from the neighborhood dogs to protect his master (Goldblum), literally, so he can create an anti-allergic-to-dogs formula for all humans. Throw in life lessons for the boy of the family, who needs to adjust to both a new replacement dog and his mostly absent(minded) father.Forget all that. The fun relies in watching what the animals will do, what secret tunnels or high-tech spy gear they're use or the fights (and cleanup) between them. Obviously, there'll be the big showdown where Lou has to be a real hero, but again, we want to see the animals talking and acting like slapstick humans.Highly recommended for kids, families and even adults. Though the sequel's due out soon and I'm not sure after the 9 year wait, the follow-up would match even half of the original's charm, I'll still see it.

Jeff Goldblum plays a scientist who is researching for a cure for dog allergies. At the start of the film, his secret-agent dog ends up getting catnapped by the evil Mr Twinkles. Mr Twinkles' aim is to stop the cure being founded. The Dog Council has to quickly find a replacement agent to protect the research. A beagle dog, called Lou (voiced by Tobey Maguire), is selected by the Brody family as a replacement for the old dog. However, it was not intended for Lou to be selected. A mishap meant that he was chosen over several specially trained agent dogs. The rest of the film follows Lou meeting up with other neighbouring dogs (also agents) and then them fighting Mr Twinkles and his evil cat friends.This film really made me laugh in several places and the animals are very cute. There are several scenes with animals hitting their heads into lamp posts and destroying houses!The animatronics and puppetery are excellent - when the animals talk, it really does look real! Also, the movements look extremely realistic - for example, when Lou is fighting the Ninja cats!Mr Twinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes) is the best character in the film - he must be one of the best movie villains in recent years. His video taped sequence is excellent! Tobey Maguire also performs well, voicing Lou the dog.However, this film is not without faults. The cats and dogs are by far the biggest stars of the film, but the Brody family and other humans are just plain annoying (especially the kid and the mother!). Furthermore, this film is not for everyone - if you are unwilling to relax and enjoy an unrealistic piece of family entertainment, then you definitely will not enjoy this!Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who likes family films. If you do not want to risk hiring it on DVD, you should definitely watch it when it comes out on television, as you may be pleasantly surprised!My rating 7/10 "},{"Title":"Silly, not bad , but very slanted racist movie.","Date":"11 December 2001","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Family","Review":"  It's a racist movie if you think about it.

The trailer was brilliant because it was able to focus on the general conceit without worrying about plot or pacing.  Sadly, there's a certain amount of dead air here which, while not entirely derailing the experience, does slam the the brakes on it a few times.It gets off to a very slow start; there are almost no solid laughs to be had for the first half hour or so.  The main problem is that the part of the story that involves humans is dead on arrival.  The film-makers are clearly not terribly interested in people, and it shows.  The pace and inventiveness really picks up when we begin to explore the world of the canine secret agents and the supervillain cat empire.  The dog headquarters sequence in particular has a manic creativity that reminded me of early Tim Burton films like Beetlejuice, and most of the piece's real laughs are found here.I give it a 6 out of 10, on the strength of the scenes that do work.  Children will probably particularly enjoy it, even though the human story may bore them.

The cast is headed by Jeff Goldblum and Elizabeth Perkins, but their by-the-numbers dysfunctional parents play second fiddle to the furry stars, the eponymous cats and dogs.An untrained puppy is mistakenly placed with Professor Brody (Goldblum) to help protect his dog allergy serum from the feline threat - for without us humans knowing, dogs and cats are locked in an eternal struggle for supremacy in a hi-tech, no-holds barred clash.The plot is largely irrelevant (fortunately), as the series of set pieces unfolds as the cats try to steal the serum and the puppy with his secret agent team try to fend them off.Highly recommended for children, but also for adults looking for something new, if undemanding.

I was extremely impressed by the animation of the animals (which had to be very tricky indeed), although some of the more complex scenes are a little rough around the edges.  There's also the undeniable cuteness factor of this movie which could get through to even the most jaded moviegoer.  Those little critters are just adorable, even more so when they are blowing things up with plastic explosives.  It's difficult to explain.The downside here is that there's not much else.  I was expecting some fairly sophisticated jokes for the adult audience and just didn't find any.  (The closest thing was a tired reference to the slow-mo karate sequences of _The Matrix_.)  Most of the time, the film relies on kid jokes and slapstick (which for some reason just isn't funny with animals). Still, I'm sad to say that this is one of the best films of the dismal summer of 2001.  Final verdict see it if you're an animal lover or you have kids.  Otherwise, don't bother.

After all, isn't that the purpose family movies serve?Cats starts off strong with a hysterical opener involving - what else? - a dog in relentless pursuit of a cat. (This sequence hit home with me; I have three dogs who go ballistic when they see anything of the feline persuasion.) It's slapstick animal comedy at its finest, particularly when the dog tries to force the cat from what appears to be a literal rubber tree.Unfortunately, after this scene ends, so do the laughs, for the most part. We are then introduced to perhaps the film's weakest link, the Brody family (Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins and Alexander Pollock). Things tended to slow to a crawl whenever they, especially Goldblum, were on screen.Like Rick Moranis in Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Goldblum spends most of the picture confined to a basement laboratory that looks like a meat locker. Perkins turns in a decent performance as Mrs. Brody, but Pollock is mired in a cliche-laden role (sullen, angry kid who eventually sees the light, a tiresome subplot that dragged down otherwise entertaining films such as Volcano and True Lies). The bestial physical humor, such as the Dogs fighting off an army of feline ninjas, wears thin after awhile as well.The film's biggest strength lies in the Dogs. Tobey Maguire provides the voice of Lou, an absolutely adorable and spunky beagle puppy. Butch (voice of Alec Baldwin), an aged Anatolian shepherd, takes him under his wing...er, paw, as he introduces the wet-behind-the-ears pup to the ongoing war vs. the evil Cats. With all due respect, this film is Baldwin's saving grace after the disappointing Final Fantasy and Pearl Harbor.Joe Pantoliano provides some funny moments as the technical whiz Peek (though a Chinese Crested is not a breed that is easy on the eyes).However, the English sheepdog Sam (Michael Clarke Duncan) is somewhat underdeveloped and easily forgettable, as is Butch's old flame, Ivy (Susan Sarandon). The movie centers around Lou, though, and Maguire successfully injects a lot of upbeat personality into the character.This, unfortunately, does not apply to the Cats. Except for the evil Persian Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes), a cat owned by a comatose Christmas tree tycoon, and his lackey Calico (Jon Lovitz), plus a briefly-seen, humorous Russian Blue assassin (voiced by Glenn Ficarra, who co-wrote the script), the other Cats are pretty much faceless minions.The much-publicized Mr. Tinkles winds up with only about half the screen time of Lou and Butch, which left little room for character development among the Cats.But this movie is by no means chopped liver. There is a priceless montage of scenes at the main Dog headquarters, overseen by an old mastiff (Charlton Heston), and I loved that a West Highland terrier sat at his side.One hilarious bit is when Butch attempts to disarm a bomb, which is a smart gag on dogs' color-blindness. Another is Mr. Tinkles' (love that name!) reaction to a hysterical Mrs. Brody after she notices that he can talk. There is a priceless scene in the beginning when Mrs. Brody chooses Lou over a litter of militaristic Doberman puppies.Plus, it has just been discovered that Cats can indeed drive limousines (This isn't NASCAR!).This film's most interesting aspect is that the conclusion takes place in a Christmas tree flocking factory, a line of work hardly explored in the movies. Plus, who wouldn't get a laugh out of Mr. Tinkles standing behind microphones and giving a speech while flanked by a huge, red propaganda poster, complete with distributed pamphlets on world domination and a loyal army of a few thousand mice?No spoilers here regarding the ending, of course, but let's just say that you'll probably feel sympathetic toward Tinkles even after everything he's done throughout the course of the film.Despite some mildly weak characters and a hot-and-cold script, director Lawrence Guterman gets two paws up for his major film debut. It's not as heartwarming as Babe, but it scarcely matters. What does is that this is a legitimate family-friendly movie that kids will get a kick out of.But for the legions of cat and dog owners out there after watching this movie, you'll start to wonder if Cats and Dogs can really communicate and conspire with each other when you're not around.  8/10  "},{"Title":"If you've ever had a pet cat or dog...

We saw this type of thing in the old Tom and Jerry cartoons, and the writers gave the same formula a James Bond/Mission Impossible theme and gave us this great comedy.  It's not anti-cat, as someone wrote in these pages, and I say that because the cats are decidedly the funniest characters in the movie.

I mean, dogs as the smart ones? Come on. Cats taking over the world is believable, but casting most of them as the not-so-smart, criminal stooges was going a bit far. Cats are smarter and more, hmm, elegant than dogs. Face it, in a showdown between cats and dogs that wasn't purely reliant on mass or strength, cats would own the dogs.Now if they had cast the dogs as the villains of the piece...that would be better. Cats like the position they're in - pampered and very little required of them- why go to the trouble of taking over and running the world when it already serves you? Another thing- dogs are the ones who chase the cats, very rarely the other way around- bit of insecurity or jealousy perhaps? Dogs also often have to actually perform, exercise, do handy things or otherwise. If they would play it as the dogs trying to oust all the freeloading superior cats....that could have been real fun.

I like its idea of a war between cats and dogs who are secretly more technologically advanced than we are, and a lot of cleverness went into the situations, but the dialog is corny. There's a load of great acting talent, but their main instruction seems to have been to ham it up for the kids. I'm not particularly fond of the animations in this, either. When a movie like this comes out and does something that hasn't been done before (in this case, mixing live-action and animation to tell a story with talking and ninja-fighting animals), it makes a big splash. Then, a few years later, when technology's improved and many other movies can do the same thing but make it look more realistic, that first movie will be forgotten if there isn't a great movie behind all the effects. And in this case, there isn't. It's a fun movie for kids, up to a certain age. If you have kids and want to leave them alone with this and feel safe that they're watching something wholesome, OK. But if you're looking for something to watch with them, there's not much here for an adult to enjoy. Even Sesame Street will drop a line, like a movie reference, that's clearly there to make the adults laugh. Some better comedy would really have gone a long way with this movie.

The effects are fantastic, and there are some certain scenes that are quite amusing, however, overall, it is a film for small children.Dr. Brody (played by Jeff Goldblum) is a scientist, who in his basement, is working on a formula to fight allergies to dogs. This sets the scene for the battle between cats and dogs (who can all talk when there are no humans around). The dogs see the advantage that this formula would give them in the world of household pets, so it is their duty to protect the formula from the evil cats. The cats wish to get the formula, and change it to make all humans allergic to dogs. This sets the scene for the war between the species.The movie is rather dull, and overblown.

Even though the whole thing was quite expensive with fifteen bucks for a movie of one and a half hour with a couple of mediocre special effects and a rather ordinary story line, I think that the follow-up is somewhat underrated because it has many funny characters, a couple of really good jokes and is overall very dynamical. The first part is overrated compared to the sequel as it is only as good as the second movie.The beginning of the movie is way too long and quite boring. The acting is ordinary and quite predictable and copies a lot of family movies such as Beethoven or Honey, I shrunk the kids. I don't know why a brilliant actor like Jeff Goldblum starred in this ordinary movie. The story itself is predictable and the ending the usual Hollywood kitsch for the (whole?) family that might please to the youngest fans but not to the rest. The connections to many spy movies that would make some adults laugh are much better in the sequel and the laughs of this first movie are simply orientated towards the younger public.What saves this movies from bad mediocrity are the animals, the great special effects and the overall entertaining qualities. Especially Mister Tinkles as the villain cat and his strange nanny are very funny while the hero Lou can't really convince. The dog Sam and the Russian cat are two amusing sidekicks but the rest of the animal cast is rather boring.In the end, one shouldn't be too severe with this movie as it is simply done to entertain a young public and surely succeeds from that point of view. The parents will be able to watch it with their children without hating it too much and some younger people that have cats or dogs at home might also like the concept. Anyone else will be more or less entertained with this flick and should rather head for better, more profound and especially more mature animation flicks such as Toy Story, How to train your dragon or Wall-E.Anybody that happens to like this movie even though it has some major flaws shouldn't believe the negative hype and watch the second movie as well.

Additionally, the special effects are truly spectacular to watch and will leave everyone smiling in amazement asking the question; how did they do that? The combination of live actors with voices of actors with incredible special effects immediately elevated Cats & Dogs to a new level of greatness. The movie takes an incredible look inside a top-secret, high-tech espionage war between cats and dogs, which their owners are completely unaware. Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Michael Clarke Duncan and Sean Hayes combine their talents and voices to create an enjoyable atmosphere.It is Mr. Tinkles and friends against Lou and friends in an ultimate battle for world domination. Mr. Tinkles is the leader of the cats as he tries to invade the Brody household to steal research for a formula that would make human allergies to dogs extinct. Lou is sent in after the Brody's dog is lost to protect the family and formula.Five minutes was all it took to give Cats & Dogs my approval because it contains so many impressive moments. Movie patrons will be glad to learn that it took me more than two hands to count the number of reasons to watch Cats & Dogs. From the special effects to the unique concept, Cats & Dogs is going to please movie patrons across the United States. For example, the unprecedented battle scenes between the cats and dogs were creative and the humor, which came from the two species, left me laughing out loud. I knew Cats & Dogs was going to be a smash hit; however, I didn't realize how much fun I could have watching the movie.The combination of live actors with voice over actors made Cats & Dogs more interesting because it was an element that makes the film more unique. For example, other films like Atlantis The Lost Empire and See Spot Run are great in their own special way; however, when you add this added element, movie patrons are guaranteed to be entertained because of the unique and rarity of the occurrences.Instant credibility came to the movie the moment I heard the voices of Baldwin and Heston because these are among the best actors in Hollywood; however, everyone involved with this movie made it a success. I hope everyone enjoys this film as much as I did because it truly is an amazing film. Cats & Dogs has my vote for the movie that will make people have the most fun. Congratulations to Goldblum and Perkins for turning in performances that made Cats & Dogs a bigger success.Aside from the special effects, the highlight of Cats & Dogs is the performances by the live actors. For example, Goldblum is the only actor in Hollywood I could think of to play the role of the scientist because th role of the scientist brought him fame in The Fly series and again in the Jurassic Park series. Elizabeth Perkins seems to be tailor made for her role as mother; furthermore, she is extremely talented, I can't wait to see her next film.In a summer that has contained animated and live action inventive family films, 2001 has added another with Cats & Dogs. There is one piece of advice I must give to everyone, which is to watch everyone of the family films and share in the enjoyment.

Lou gets exposed to the secret dog intelligence organization, and begins to learn about the cats' plans. However, the second half I thought was a bit overdone with CGI and animatronics to have the cats and dogs engage in all sorts of battles. Still fun, but not as much. The whole story was done cleverly. The dogs might be in a group, talking to each other, when a human approaches. To cover themselves, they would initiate typical dog behavior, digging a hole, sniffing butts, etc until the person passed, then they would engage again in conversation. The computer effects to get the animals to apparently talk and smile, or form other expressions, was the best I have seen so far.

(I mean of course the 1961 original, which, sadly, was remade in 1996 using exactly the same techniques we see here.  Does ANYONE have a clue these days?)  The tacky, awkward-looking footage of talking dogs doesn't even have an economic justification.  To make Cats and Dogs look this shoddy Warner Brothers spent $US60 million.  Disney's plush animated features typically cost $US100 million, but it's possible to do well for less; The Iron Giant, for instance, cost Warner Brothers just $US48 million.The advantages of hand-drawn animation are many.  It looks better.  It makes for a more integrated design (as it stands, is Cats and Dogs a live action film, or a digital cartoon?  The film itself doesn't know any more than I do).  Good character animation is unforced and natural; using computers to make dogs' mouths appear to move in sync with English speech gives the painful impression - hard to shake off - that the animals have been possessed by sorcery and are being forced to do something against their will.  And most importantly, a script as threadbare as this one badly needs the visual wit that pen-and-ink character animators could hardly fail to provide.I love the idea of a secret government of dogs at the Earth's core devoted to furthering our interests (and by extension, theirs), that the Ancient Egyptians were in fact slaves ruled by cats and ultimately freed by dogs.

But as Buffy the Vampire Slayer once said, And that's a bad thing because...?Top-billed Jeff Goldblum and Elizabeth Perkins actually spend less time on screen than the title characters, which is only fair seeing as they're the real stars anyway - writers John Requa and Glenn Ficarra are very clearly dog-people (you do wish they could have put in a plot twist that has the dumbest of our four-footed friends turn out to be working for the other side - although the climax does have one of the species' biggest natural enemies turn out as such, which I won't reveal here), which would be more of a bother if I didn't hate both cats AND dogs in real life. On the big screen, of course, is another matter.Some of the plot points are a bit too hard to swallow even for a movie like this, and the animatronic effects of Jim Henson's Creature Shop are a lot more convincing than some of the CGI animation (especially with the cats), but the movie makes up for its flaws by zipping along, never letting the action and frequently funny comedy flag for long, and passing the finishing line under 90 minutes, with some very entertaining characterisations, particularly heroes Lou and Buddy and evil feline Mr. Tinkles (a good voice job from Sean Hayes), who atones to cat-lovers by getting the movie's best lineMr. Tinkles (to idiotic underling in a burning room) I want you to stay here.I.U.

Classic movies such as the Lassie series, the very funny Turner and Hooch and Milo and Otis, are much better than this battle between the canines and felines.Meet the evil Persian Feline Mr. Tinkles, Rookie beagle puppy Lou, Special Operative Agent Butch, Slinky long-legged stray Ivy, Big Hearted sheepdog Sam, Chinese hairless electronics expert Peek and Chief Dog Commander Mastiff. This is a tale that pits crack canine agents against their malicious four legged fiends. What is at stake is more than just a battle for the best seat on the couch. It's a fang-sinking, tail- wagging action-packed war to win domestic supremacy. Things are gunna get hairy. Doggone it!Well I might as well comment on what good points that this film has. The voiceovers are probably the best part of this film. With big names including Sean Hayes, from the TV sitcom Will and Grace. He was great with voice of the evil cat, Mr. Tinkles. Tobey Macquire is one of Hollywood's newest stars and his voicing of the puppy Lou, was terrific. I enjoyed his role in the movie Cider House Rules. Alec Baldwin was great as the tough man Butch. He has a very good movie career and his voiceovers were great. Then to top it off you have stars Susan Saradon as the voice of stray dog Ivy and Michael Clarke Duncan as the Chinese dog, Peek. There are so many celebrities that voiced characters that the list is too long to mention.The special effects that Cats and Dogs had to offer, were pretty good. When you think about the effort put in to bring the story too life they were well done. The animatronics were also of a good quality and really did astound me. They were not unlike those used in the terrific movie, Chicken Run. Then you have the real animals that were trained very well on set. This is always a difficult area, but on this occasion it was done very well.The stars of this movie were for one of a better word indifferent. The best member of the cast, was Alexander Pollack who played little Scott Broody. His role was a great, yet I can not say much more for the rest of the cast. Jeff Goldblum is a star in his own right with great movie credits including Independence day and Jurassic Park just too name a few. Yet his role in this movie was what I can only call ridiculous, as nothing about it was that great.  Then the role played by Elizabeth Perkins was even worse, if you ask me. I do not know much of her work, apart from the very funny movie, '28 Days', starring the gorgeous Sandra Bullock.  Yet this film also has another bad downfall, that of the script. For one it is childish and two it is just bad. Nothing about it made me stand up and pay great attention to it. It was a silly story that in places made no sense at all. Especially the way that Professor Brody tries to find an answer to the way humans and dogs can be completely compatible was just plain stupid. I am sure this story was only meant for young kids as they are the only ones that  could get great enjoyment from it. I wished I had left this title on the video store shelf as that is where deserves to stay. No matter how much work goes into bringing a film to life, it needs to be classy, and this film was not classy.  I mean hire a film like Chicken run if you want to see an animal film that has a little class and style. I see that there is to be a second Cats and Dogs film made. However publicized it is, this is one patron that wont be attending it in the cinema, or hiring it off the video store shelf. Very disappointing is all I can say Cats and Dogs was.

Perhaps I was spoiled by 'Shrek', which seemed so perfect for grownups and kids, but it just didn't seem like it was a true family flick - more like a 12-and-younger movie.The movie revolves around a supposed war between cats and dogs that stretches back millenia. The main humans in the movie are the family of one wannabe secret agent puppy who is accidentaly drafted to protect the family from the cats, who want to get the father's secret serum.The movie is cute from the start, and features a lot of enginuity, but I have to say I agree with most of the critics it wears thin after a while, and the family really starts to grate on you. If they hadn't been such major players, and maybe just stayed in the background with the focus on the cats and dogs, I wouldn't have minded, but it just got so annoying after a while.There are many, many cute moments that may make you grin, and some that will make you roll your eyes if you're an adult. The kids, however, are likely to love this movie because it features what kids like best action, cuteness, humor, and a world that maybe, just maybe, could be actually happening. If you've got a cat or dog, though, be prepared for your kids' jokes when you get home. I know that my little bro and I were wary of our cats and dogs for a while after seeing the movie, wondering if they were really secret agents in disguise.

Cats & Dogs is the latest to join an elite list including Atlantis The Lost Empire, Dr. Dolittle 2, Spy Kids, See Spot Run and Shrek; proves family oriented films such as these will entertain all ages.Cats & Dogs is one of the most unique adventure films I have seen because it combines humor, intelligence and the technical savvy to call itself a box-office hit. Additionally, the special effects are truly spectacular to watch and will leave everyone smiling in amazement asking the question; how did they do that? The combination of live actors with voices of actors with incredible special effects immediately elevated Cats & Dogs to a new level of greatness. The movie takes an incredible look inside a top-secret, high-tech espionage war between cats and dogs, which their owners are completely unaware. Jeff Goldblum, Elizabeth Perkins, Alec Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, Michael Clarke Duncan and Sean Hayes combine their talents and voices to create an enjoyable atmosphere.It is Mr. Tinkles and friends against Lou and friends in an ultimate battle for world domination. Mr. Tinkles is the leader of the cats as he tries to invade the Brody household to steal research for a formula that would make human allergies to dogs extinct. Lou is sent in after the Brody's dog is lost to protect the family and formula.Five minutes was all it took to give Cats & Dogs my approval because it contains so many impressive moments. Movie patrons will be glad to learn that it took me more than two hands to count the number of reasons to watch Cats & Dogs. From the special effects to the unique concept, Cats & Dogs is going to please movie patrons across the United States. For example, the unprecedented battle scenes between the cats and dogs were creative and the humor, which came from the two species, left me laughing out loud. I knew Cats & Dogs was going to be a smash hit; however, I didn't realize how much fun I could have watching the movie.The combination of live actors with voice over actors made Cats & Dogs more interesting because it was an element that makes the film more unique. For example, other films like Atlantis The Lost Empire and See Spot Run are great in their own special way; however, when you add this added element, movie patrons are guaranteed to be entertained because of the unique and rarity of the occurrences.Instant credibility came to the movie the moment I heard the voices of Baldwin and Heston because these are among the best actors in Hollywood; however, everyone involved with this movie made it a success. I hope everyone enjoys this film as much as I did because it truly is an amazing film. Cats & Dogs has my vote for the movie that will make people have the most fun. Congratulations to Goldblum and Perkins for turning in performances that made Cats & Dogs a bigger success.Aside from the special effects, the highlight of Cats & Dogs is the performances by the live actors. For example, Goldblum is the only actor in Hollywood I could think of to play the role of the scientist because th role of the scientist brought him fame in The Fly series and again in the Jurassic Park series. Elizabeth Perkins seems to be tailor made for her role as mother; furthermore, she is extremely talented, I can't wait to see her next film.In a summer that has contained animated and live action inventive family films, 2001 has added another to its top ten list with Cats & Dogs. There is one piece of advice I must give to everyone, which is to watch everyone of the family films and share in the enjoyment.

As what usually happens in this situation, neither effect was successfully achieved.  The plot was stupid, the movie at times was painful to watch.  For a movie that looked like it might be original it was awfully cliche.  The characters of the dogs were pretty much all stereotypes.

I don't want to sound too mean, I do enjoy most good kid's movies, but it was a shame to see what they did to this given the great potential it had. To it's credit there were a couple of funny scenes.  The ninja cats and the Russian spy were both funny.

Instead, dogs are exulted as the righteous protectors of humans while cats are portrayed as sneaky, back-stabbing animals with no redeeming qualities and only want to rule the world. Also, the violent animation goes a bit far at times. This could show kids that one, its okay to hurt animals, and 2, cats are mean creatures and don't make good pets. I really think the latter will be likely.I would have preferred to see both the cats and dogs in a conflict that had them both on the same moral footing and in the end make a truce and live in peaceful co-existance with humans.

In the climax at the flocking manufacturing plant, I was worried about Mr. Tinkles and assuming he had died.  His ultimate fate at the hands of the disgusting middle aged ladies who dressed him up was, admittedly better than having him die, but still was unfunny.

I mean the trailers really worked. They were funny. But, sadly the end result is just plain ol' silly. This movie is definitely geared toward people under the age of ten. Don't get me wrong, though, the movie is entertaining enough to give it an okay rating, but, it's just too silly to be taken as a good movie (which is a 7/10 in my book). The silliest moment of the film comes when a dog bends an entire tree that a cat is up, and lets go making the cat fling off like it was a sling shot. Silly, I know.I will say that the special effects in this film are pretty damn good. I mean the 'cats & dogs' really look like they are talking, smiling, and frowning. The fight scenes were very well done, and I enjoyed the umpteenth parody of The Matrix in this film.The movie is a bit biased, though, making you wanna root for the dogs, but I on the other hand didn't really care who won. All I knew was that the cats were funnier and more entertaining then the dogs. One of my two favorite scenes came from when the ninja cats broke into the dogs home and kick all kinds of Matrix-style ass. My second favorite scene was with the deep-voiced Russian Kitty and his cool accent and many funny one-liners. My favorite lines came from Mr. Tinkles (voiced by Sean Hayes) and Calico (voiced by Jon Lovitz) at the end in the burning room when Mr. Tinkles says 'I want you to stay here' and Calico asks 'Why?' and Mr. Tinkles replies 'Because I hate you.'

I couldn't resist chuckling very loud at the cinema. The jokes were all extremely original like the rest of the movie and all of them succeeded excellently. While the movie does work resoundingly well as a comedy, the drama area is not the one for Cats & Dogs. There are many cheesy father-and-son moments and boy-and-his-dog and they aren't played out or written properly, losing points for the flick. However, I still loved the comedy and action, it was hilarious and I really got into the spirit of this movie. And I just loved that dog kennel! Press your hand (or paw) on the back and computers and gadgets whiz out at you. That red button dog train service just takes the cake. The voices for the movie were all good, particularly Sean Hayes' take on the evil Mr. Tinkles. The live-action acting was alright, with Elizabeth Perkins putting on the best show, but the voice-overs were just fabulous, over-ruling the live-action acting like the dogs over-rule cats at the start.

The film makes the oldest mistake of children's movies; it assumes that kids don't understand anything, and so dumbs the humor down to their level.   Unfortunately, this always results in a dumb movie, insulting to kids and torture for adults.The one joke in the move is that  dogs and cats are technologically advanced creatures; and yet their behavior is so stupid  (especially the cats, who are supposed to be the evil menace), that you don't believe this premise for a second. The movie also makes the most obvious mistake in a movie that uses high-tech effects; it makes the technology and the effects the star of the show, not the characters. The dogs and cats have absolutely no character development, and we don't care about any of them.  The human characters are even worse.  They are presented as idiots and morons, for no reason (unless the producers believed this is how kids see adults or would like to see adults in a movie; another fallacy.  Kids like to see likable adults and likable kids they can relate to.A movie kids and adults would have liked would have put the relationships and characters first, the plot second supporting the characters, and the effects last, supporting, not taking the place of, the characters and plot.    For instance, the technology of the cats and dogs is supposed to be secret from humans; half of the humor would have been in finding ways to keep it out of sight of humans in novel ways. There was no reason why the movie could not have had an intelligent script; because it was for children, the producers decided they would be just too dumb to enjoy it.    These are the same producers that grew up with Bullwinkle in the 60s and the Muppet Show in the 70s, that snuck ironic and (gasp) intelligent humor into every joke;  yet they forget this themselves.Jim Henson, the founder of the muppets, alas is no longer with us. But Frank Oz is; if he had been given the script to rewrite and the move to direct, we would have had a truly funny film all ages could have appreciated, not the doggy-doo this movie is. (Most unforgivable moment in the film; assuming that kids can't appreciate clever humor but can appreciate dog fart jokes.  If children could unionize, they should lodge a defamation suit against the producers of this film.) Keep your kid and yourself away from this drek; you'll be glad you did.

"},{"Title":"Skitzo Plot Costs This Dog A Bone","Date":"14 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Family","Review":"  Perhaps the most frightening thing about Cats & Dogs is how good it could have been.  Nothing quite this unique has come along the pipeline of popular movie culture for some time, and unless the returns for this first outing are stellar, nothing else probably will.  As a movie-goer who has absolutely frothed at the mouth, with images of the sinister Mr. Tinkles shouting I'm king of the world and thoughts of insanely frenetic combat between the two greatest sidekicks to humanity dancing in my head, I had implored others to give the concept a chance.  The concept itself had to be worth a viewing, after all.  A mad Persian cat commanding a host of ninjas, bomb specialists, thieves, wiseguys, fishmongers, spies, warriors ... zeroing in on a group of dogs, it has to be movie gold ... right?I wish.  I really, really wish.  Upon viewing the product, I find that I feel vaguely indifferent.  And I think, when I examine the movie in review, it can  be traced directly to the indecisive nature of the plot.MASSIVE, REALLY BIG SPOILERS BELOWThe most painful aspect of Cats & Dogs is its few brief lapses into brilliance, where the film masterfully demonstrates just how funny it *could* have been.  The scenes featuring the actual takeover of the world, where the fanatic Mr. Tinkles takes on a Stalinesque demeanor but then calmly imparts the plan for world conquest to the army of mice, is fantastic- if you'll please turn now to page 3 in your world domination pamphlets ...  It's a single scene riot unmatched throughout the rest of the film, the one shining spot where the writers seem to be unafraid of taking the premise to its fullest potential.  Had the movie been filled with such surreal presentations, it might very well be the summer sleeper for 2001, if not beyond.But the movie only dares to cross the line once, (and perhaps also in the scene at the Canine headquarters), only stretches its creative might as the cats mount their final assault against the world.  (And even that scene became blurred by choppy editing and a tacky conclusion).The rest of the film is watered down by what I can only see as a useless plot involving the child and the father, and a nearly as incomprehensible plot involving the dog choosing to be a normal dog due to a chance encounter with a featured star.  I never once cared for the humans, and I never once wanted to see them on the screen; they only interrupted the real movie that was supposed to be taking place, or in the case of the dog and the child, de-rail it.  I don't want to ignore people that say this is a good family feature ... perhaps it is.  But I really think Cats & Dogs true potential was ruined by trying to make it a family movie.  That's formulaic. Nothing new.After the initial scenes, the writing fights back and forth between being spy thriller and a family matinee, never committing to either and ultimately doing neither a service.  And honestly, I don't think either of the human-related subplots were needed.  This film yearns to be a true spy classic ... no, it practically screams to be a true spy tale.  It has the characters to do so, it has the voice acting to do so, and reaches to be the animal equivalent of James Bond, only to then relapse into cliche family-friendly writing.  Since there are several scenes in the trailers (such as Mr. Tinkles on the statue?) that were not in the film, I can only conclude that the suits, or the bean counters, or whoever, forced the powers behind it to reshape it as such; there is no way that the writers who did the final scene could be so unaware of the injustice the first sixty minutes served.Instead of taking so much time to show us poorly edited hints at the strained family bonds, why not give us a glimpse of the cats' world?  Why not show the Cat Alliance's headquarters, or its operatives in meetings? Show the Black Russians in their cold Kiev bunkers, selecting an agent and negotiating with Mr. Tinkles on the fish it will cost to send a good agent? Or explain why Calico sticks by Tinkles, even though it's clear the cats in general think Tinkles a fool.  Give us reasons as to why this single Persian cat can control the legions of cats we see in later scenes, even as they laugh at him near the film's beginning.I mean, since realism is already thrown out the door, wouldn't it have been a treat to find out such things?  Imagine the humor that could have been written in if we had found out that, yes, Tinkles was indeed Blofeld's precious pet?  Or perhaps the son of that same line?  True, that's a throwback to another film, but still ... even that thought, that small scene would have been a treat and a half as compared to scenes of the boy forlornly kicking a soccer ball around.It is a shame that we are shown so very little in this film.  Only told, and expected to accept.Instead of just telling us that the cats are dangerous and powerful, why not spend time to build the cats into a credible threat?  Forget about the child and the silly premise that accompanies him, and take us on a joyride through the cats' world.There is little time at all given to explaining the cats, showing how they work and operate ... only enough time to vilify them as the plucky dog strives to gain his master's love and the others go through a tired poor choices in life song and dance.  I fully expected the puppy to break out in song at two points during the film, the way the plot was unfolding.  Maybe even a duet with the wise old Saluki.Had the film chosen to give up that dull road, and instead make this a true spy film, giving no air to humans and every minute to the animals, showing the full extent of the war between feline and canine ... believe me, I still love the characters.  I desperately want a full poster of Tinkles in front of the Forward To Victory banner.  I think the idea and its principles are a laugh riot.  And yes, there were several points at which I burst out laughing.    This ISN'T NASCAR!But I don't want to see the movie again.

Having now wasted a glorious Saturday afternoon (during Calgary Stampede week no less, when I could have been doing something REALLY enjoyable), I feel immensely cheated. The trailer reveals that the film has some good lines and that it entails an intriguing and pregnant premise. What the trailer doesn't show is the almost non-stop dreck that litters and ruins the rest of the film. I am talking about an unnecessary, distracting, obligatory and unconvincing sentimentality to the whole thing. Three cliched aspects are especially annoying1. The dad (Jeff Goldblum, absolutely sleepwalking) is a scientist who, despite the fact that he works at home, is apparently neglectful of his so. We know this because of his inattention to junior's soccer tryouts. This tension lends to some appalling resolution (sorry for the slight spoiler but if you can't see this coming you lack a pulse) that has nothing at all to do with cats or dogs and is not remotely humourous.2. Lou the beagle has not only to help save the world from the cats- he also has to earn the love of junior, who (in an unspeakably stupid and unbelievable scene) rejects the dog initially- as if ANY little kid would reject a darling beagle puppy, but the plot requires this kind of stuptidity. Why can't the movie focus on the battle at hand instead of attempting this sentimentality, complete with soaring violins? ICK!3. For no fathomable reason whatsoever, a stray voiced by poor Susan Sarandon shows up as the love interest for the grizzled head dog, Lou's mentor. Ah. So the general has a romantic past- WHAT was the POINT of that??I would add that there were some annoyances typical of a lot of family films that most viewers apparently accept uncritically but that set my teeth on edge1. The quirky scientist, with no apparent means of financial support and his realtor wife live in a house that is easily worth a million dollars, on a massive lot with impeccably maintained gardens. Doesn't this depiction of social class bother anybody but me?2. Susan Sarandon's stray is clearly a pure-bred- a saluki I think. Oh the idle rich- how dare they abandon a $3000 dog? Do Hollywood writers- who clearly themselves come overwhelmingly from the privileged classes- have any idea how real people live, especially how their purported characters might live?I have to add as a Canadian (one who recently immigrated here from the US) that I can never live down, or understand, the need for films like this one, shot in Victoria, BC has to be set in America- one of the first scenes shows a USPS letter box and one Russian cat maligns these American security systems. NOTHING in the movie hinges on American-ness in any way, so why not just set the damn thing in BC? So producers of these films believe that Americans would refuse to see a movie set where it is actually filmed?

But, this is also - generally speaking - a kids movie. However, the sequences involving The Ninjas or The Russian were just too incredibly hilarious and inventive that they far outweighed the bad parts.Part of the problem with the reviews Cats & Dogs is receiving is the fact that people just need to lighten the hell up. They think it's cool and trendy and admirable to act like jaded movie-goers with delicately refined tastes that allow them to walk all over anything they decide sucks. Cats & Dogs isn't fantastic, and it's not going to win any awards, but it does manage to be enjoyable, and at times, even smart. I think anyone could enjoy this if they just loosened up, took the over-the-top cheese with a grain of salt, and let themselves go to a light stab at a live action cartoon.

This is really just a kid flick. With nothing appealing to adults, this film is weak and shows signs of breaking during any of its 87 minutes.Cats & Dogs is about the secret war between cats and dogs... oh how original (sarcasm). It shows how cats fights dogs all over the country as they wage war in the most bizarre ways possible. It's a lazy film with poor action or jokes, then again poor voice acting and poor CGI work do all that. The wars get into the real world while they are unwatched by the humans. It's truly just an impossible concept as the story builds and it becomes more and more impossible. There's nothing really good to say about this film.Overall, this is truly a kid's movie as they won't be able to understand how bad it is. It has some interesting parts but going into them, they become weird and bizarre in which you lose more interest. The film is horrible. I don't even know why I bought the DVD.

They were more realistic looking, which is not a good thing because most of them were not cute and cuddly, and I don't even like cute and cuddly dogs.Still, there were a lot a fun moments, and this movie was quite funny. As in 'Babe', this movie had what looked like real animals digitally altered so as to appear to be talking.

Glenn Ficarra was quite intimidating as a Russian Blue who still sounded like he was to be feared by those living under communism.  Jeff Goldblum reminded me a lot of Wayne Szalinski in the TV series 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' (not necessarily a good thing), but I was surprised to see an actor of his caliber in such a role.  The technology used by the animals reminded me a lot of 'Spy Kids'.Parents who don't mind their kids watching the Bugs Bunny and Tom and Jerry cartoons would find almost nothing to object to here.  Though there was plenty of cartoonish violence, and I was a little surprised Fox TV gave it a TV-G rating.  Especially after I thought I heard the word for ... gas.  It may have been another word.

I wish I could see his reaction to the behavior of the cats and dogs in this movie! I'm sure that Cats & Dogs is a fun movie for a much younger audience, but the scope of the film is so narrow that it can only really be enjoyed by kids. The movie was obviously not made by cat people, by the way, because of the fact that the cats are obviously the evil antagonists in the film, so if you have and love a cat or two in your household, it may be a good idea not to rent this one for your kids.

The rest of the time I rolled my eyes.This movie's biggest problem is that it takes itself too seriously.  Yes, we even have a heart-tugging scene where the kid is crying and saying You're not a loser, Lou and you're supposed to think Oh no, is he dead?  Look, this is a movie about cats trying to take over the world.  They should have just left out the melodrama and just reveled in the sheer insanity of such an idea.Also, the mom in this movie is an idiot.  First off, she brings home a brand new puppy, then keeps scolding it and throwing it outside every time that it goes on the carpet (which is a method used by the cats to stop the dogs). Seeing as how housebreaking a puppy takes a good six months or so, I wonder if the people who wrote this script even know how to take care of pets? Then, later, a cat spy (which is a Russian Blue kitten, complete with a Boris Badinov stereotype voice!) gets snuck in because the mom stops the car and sees the cat.  Her reaction?  She coos and takes it home.  Yea, never MIND that it might have rabies or that it might be someone else's cat.  She instantly decides to adopt it.  Elizabeth Perkins have must be pretty desperate to play this role.  And no need to elaborate how Jeff Goldblum is in yet another really annoying role in a bad movie.This movie will insult your intelligence, even you have the IQ of a rock. If you got some REAL cats and dogs to make a movie, it would certainly be much better than this sorry excuse for a kiddy flick.  I worry about the next generation when every form of entertainment seems geared towards dumbing them down.

I challengethis movie's message. Consider that while we adults know it is notreal peril, would a child?The violence towards animals in Cats and Dogs is not natural.It's not a lost cat in a tornado, nor a dog being chased by a bear, orwhatever events animals routinely face in the world. Rather, theviolence is volitional. Knives and bombs are thrown at pets. Atleast one dog is kidnapped and killed. The fact that the violencetowards animals is committed by other animals doesn't lessen it.In fact, I could see where it would make it worse. Since theanimals all talk, and all have human personalities, the probabilitythat very young viewers may identify with the animal aggressors ishigh.Some people argue that children aren't dummies, and they can tellthe difference between a cartoon or movie and real life. Althoughmuch research disagrees, and shows clearly that kids CANNOTaccurately tell the difference, the effect doesn't have to be total for itto be deadly. That is, a kid doesn't need to be deluded or 100%under the sway of TV or movies in order to replicate some of thosebehaviors in the real world. A child may only need to hit the familydog ONCE with an axe, or drop the cat into a pot of boiling waterONCE, for terrible consequences to occur. And FYI-- there are,indeed, thousands of such acts committed by real world childrenevery day, to real world animals. Besides the horror for theanimals, this can't be good for the kids, either.Also, the well documented effect of sensitization describes thatwhile seeing exaggerated stunts and gags may be funny the firstfew times, EVENTUALLY those scenes also create an impliedacceptability for the behavior. That is, we adults laugh today at astunt dog falling off of a building, but in three years (or whatever) itwill also appear to be OK, normal and acceptable behavior. Again,research shows that very young viewers cannot discern thedifferences between fantasy, theater tricks, and reality.So, stay away from this movie, and wait for someone with a moreactive or profound social sensibility to explore a similar theme.

We're all familiar with this whole cats hate dogs and dogs hate cats routine in many cartoons(Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes for example), but I think this movie is getting carried away with that concept. The CGI effects are especially full of bull crap and this movie obviously loves seeing animals getting hurt in the process. If the Nostalgia Critic were to see this movie, he would go crazy as an ape. Like I said, this movie is like Beverly Hills Chihuahua and Marmaduke because of the bland characters, despicable special effects, a pointless plot, and a ton of other things that make this movie very bad. Who directed this piece of dog and cat crap anyway?! What?! Lawrence Guterman?! Oh no, not him! Not that moron who made Son of the Mask! Not him!! Anything but him!! Get this piece of trash of my sight and throw it in the junkyard!

The idea was good, but it could have been done better. I'm a dog person so the evil cats didn't bother me. Don't get me wrong, I like cats too. I think the reason the cats were the bad guys was because of their cattitude. Dogs are loving, loyal, intelligent, and people's best friend and cats don't give a darn. I think the CG is awesome, the animals pretty much look like they're actually doing those wacky stunts. I hated when Mr. Tinkles told the fired factory workers to kick their dogs. That's just horrible. I found it hilarious when Butch the dog said son of my mother, I think that seems like something a dog would say^^ Well, that's about it.

The trailer was HILARIOUS. The way it was so flawlessly put together made me really want to see this movie. Hollywood lied to me again.It seems all the funny parts of the movie were thrown in that trailer. The story is OK(its based off of a Saturday morning 90's cartoon by the same name) for a kids movie but other than that its kinda...stupid. The kid in the movie ruined it. I think they tried to make the movie too human when,in fact, its meant to be about ANIMALS. I mean, he was the worst choice for the star. One part has a such a blatantly obvious attempt at subliminal advertisement when,after a long pause, it shows a quick flash of the kid drinking Hi-C. What the hell? Despite the abuse of animals and the thousands of cats killed in the process, I would recommend this movie for small children and PETA animal worshippers/ PETA high priest.Good Day.

If not, stay away. Cats & Dogs is about a war between our lovable house pets, centered on Lou the Dog (voiced by Tobey Maguire) that has been recruited into the canine army. Of course the entire movie can't be that cool. it has to stray into the dog-annoying kid relationship that gets really, really boring really quickly and the secret life of Butch the Dog (Alec Baldwin). The movie has a lot of cartoon noises as buggy-eyed cats & dogs kick that crap out of each other (any of which would constitute animal cruelty). As it's disconcerting to see a ninja cat round-kick a dog's face, sending it soaring through the air and landing with a resounding BOING! Since the majority of the audience is made up of children that actually think the movie's jokes are funny, it's totally possible that small children will begin to think that beating up small animals is &#145;funny'.In fact, the only thing this movie had going for it was the cartoonish voiced cats (did I mention they're evil?), certainly the evil cat-leader Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes), who reminds the John Lovitz voiced cat Calico `At what point did you forget that we are trying to take over the world!' Other than that, the movie is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. The actual acting is bad, the script is bad, and the jokes are bad (for example, a cat runs up a scrawny tree to escape from a pursuing dog, to which the dog catapults the cat through a window, barely missing a woman with a pie, to which the dog soars in pursuit, to, not surprisingly, sink the pie onto the woman's face). Jeff Goldblum plays a scientist working on a cure for allergies to canines, and really only makes appearances when he leaves his lock & key lab strewn with always stupid, and always changing pieces of lab equipment.The movie sums up as an excuse to create ninja-cats and secret agent dogs. Animals that will soon be turned into action toys, and I can already see a cartoon series on the WB in the works. The movie lacks in entertainment (well, after the first fifteen minutes) and repeats the tired old routine that has been played over countless times in order to steal parents' money. Good money that will be wasted to repeat the same process again, again, and again.

There are loads of worthwhile children's films out there, so why would anyone waste time on this one? Having seen the trailer, I was hoping for much more. I was thoroughly disappointed. The plot is predictable, the gags are second-hand, the special effects were spotty, at best. Every sci-fi/fantasy film (what genre would this one be?) requires a certain amount of suspension of disbelief. But that should not mean that anything goes! A film must be true to the integrity of the world it creates. Hence, I was particularly chafed by the early scene in which the dog bends over a tree completely and sends a cat catapulting through the air. At least some laws of physics must hold true even in a movie as outlandish as this one. Otherwise, why would the pie fall on the woman's face. It could just as easily remain suspended in the air. I know this may seem like a minor harangue, but others have so thoroughly dissected this movie's major flaws, I just thought I'd add my two cents. Don't waste your time on this movie!

I went to the bathroom freely, got myself a soda, and didn't mind. Some parts that still stick with me (in my nightmares) areBad Matrix. Seeing terribly animated cats do the worst Matrix parodies is not high on my to do list. I also got a plot that I didn't understand. The 'bad' guy (of course a cat, all cats are evil while dogs are man's best friend) like crams it into one half of a sentence, the other half being perhaps the corniest laugh I ever heard. This movie also had little humor, if any. In fact, I don't think I was supposed to laugh at the parts I did laugh at. (like how it looked when the 'evil' guy's HQ blew up) Acting. We don't need no stinkin' acting. People make fun of how Jake Lloyd performed in Star Wars I. The kid in this...I wanted to see the opposite camera angle. I could probably read the cue cards. And finally, predictability. Okay, okay, I know that it's supposed to be sad, the little boy crying over his 'dead' dog. Had it not been for the fact that I saw it in a hotel and people might have been sleeping, I might have yelled, THROW THE STUPID BEAST IN THE SNOW, YOU NITWIT! HE'S ASLEEP! JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIES! THAT'LL WAKE HIM UP! And of course, the dog wakes up with a corny line. You're my best friend too. Thank God I hadn't eaten earlier, or I might have vomited all over the room. Eww.
