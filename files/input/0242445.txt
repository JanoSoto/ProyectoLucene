A total blast!","Date":"4 August 2001","Score":"31 out of 41 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Anybody should know when you're getting ready to see a Steven Seagal movie you're not getting ready to see a Greek tragedy.  What makes Exit Wounds special is it's all in good fun.  There's no pretentions whatsoever.  In fact, it even leaves a good share of the running time for comic relief.  You have spectacular action in one corner...you have hilarious comedy in the other...what the hell more can you ask for?  Seagal hasn't made an action flick in a while, so it was great to see him again on the silver screen.  He takes a lot of flack for gaining a little weight.  OK, so he's heavier than normal.  So maybe him and Sammo Hung been hanging out in the same buffet.  But Seagal can still kick butt like he did back in Above the Law and Hard to Kill.  His action scenes are always fun to watch.  As I tell people, I'm not easily aroused by action scenes.  I can be just as bored by an action scene as one would get bored during an episode of Masterpiece Theater.  But Seagal's action scenes have a sense of originality and flare.  Big deal.  He's not the best actor.  Does his work require great dramatic acting?  Would a dramatic monologue be appropriate during one of HIS movies?  Let's be sensible.  I think people are way too hard on the man.  He's still cool with me.In the comedy department, we have the uninhibited Tom Arnold.  Arnold plays the stereotypical cheesy talk show host, who takes anger-management classes with Seagal.  There's a hilarious scene where Seagal loses his temper and throws a fit, yelling to the teacher I'm a happy person! with anger in his eyes.  Then Arnold decides that Seagal would be a perfect guest for his show.  Also, we have Anthony Anderson of Me Myself and Irene fame.  He was one of the foul-mouthed African-American brothers in the Farrelly Brothers comedy.  He gets an even bigger opportunity to flaunt his comic chops in this flick.  In fact, him and Tom Arnold have a hysterically funny conversation at the end credits, so PLEASE don't be so quick to walk out the theater.  DMX is not a terrific actor, but he's fairly good.  He proves his discipline as an actor in a more restrained role than his starring role in Hype Williams' Belly.  In that film, he pretty much portrayed a character out of all his rap videos.  So that wasn't a big stretch.  EW gives him more to work with.  Not the role of a lifetime, but meatier than a drug-dealing gangsta.  And did I mention Jill Hennesy is in the cast?  Oh...mannnnn!  She is an absolute knockout!  Perfect eye candy!  Throw in a gratuitous strip club scene(which this film has), and we have the ultimate guy flick. With DMX in the lead, naturally we have to expect some of his songs on the soundtrack.  And he provides some good stuff.  One--which was used in the previews and thankfully was used in the movie too--is a remix of Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone.  It's quite innovative how they insert an artist's songs into a movie's soundtrack.  There's also a scene where DMX is picking out a car and blasts on the stereo his song Why Do Good Girls Love Bad Guys.  There isn't much depth to Exit Wounds.  In fact, I don't know if there's any depth.  But a film like this is meant strictly for exhibition.  And in that department, it really really delivers!  It's exciting!  It's funny!  It's rousing!  It's a thrill a minute!  You won't be bored for a second!  An hour and thirty minutes of sheer, uninhibited fun!  Exit Wounds won't have you heading to the exit.  In fact, you probably won't even want to go out for popcorn you'll be having such a great time!

This means I desired high-flying, over-the-top action that includes lots of cool martial arts, mushroom cloud explosions, high speed car chases and catastrophic crashes, and ultra-violent death scenes. Boy does this movie deliver!I've been reading some of the other user reviews here on imdb and many are saying this is Seagal's best flick. I would probably agree that it is close. His stiff under-acting makes him perfect for this Dirty Harry type part.The plot is nothing new. Seagal is a strung-out lone ranger cop who plays by his own rules...well you know the type, this character has been used in countless movies. Basically, Seagal's character finally goes too far (by throwing the Vice President off a bridge no less!) Thus, Seagal gets demoted down to the most dangerous precinct in town. Once there, he begins to discover crooked cops and internal conspiracies. With no one to trust and people trying (emphasis on trying) to kill him left and right, Seagal starts kicking ass and taking names.Yes I know, this storyline is as old as they come, but I maintain that cheesy action flicks aren't about great or novel plot lines. No, cheesy action flicks are about great action with all the things I listed above, in which, this movie delivers the goods with a bang. This movie also stars DMX, who is surprisingly competent as one of the main and most interesting characters of the movie.  Generally good performances all around. I never noticed any laughably bad acting. Flashy directing and nice production design are also bonuses. This tired plot even still manages a few interesting twists (I won't reveal anything for those who haven't seen the movie, but lets just say everyone is not how they seem, including the bad guys). FINAL RATING 7/10 - As good as a cliched action flick can be. Semi-interesting characters, a few plot twists here and there, steady, interesting action, flashy directing, decent performances, plenty of cool explosions, exciting car chases, and numerous excellent violent death scenes. This movie is truly the creme de la creme of cheesy action flicks!

But then veteran action producer Joel Silver thrust Steve back in the limelight, put him on the Slimfast diet gave him slightly better material to work with. After all, an actor can only do as good as the script.From a novel of the same name by John Westerman (but bearing minimal resemblance to it) the plot centers on Orin Boyd, a cop busted down to patrolman after a rough encounter with the Vice-President. Once on the streets Boyd's suspicious nose can't keep him out of trouble with undercover cops who are trying to bust local Drug Boss Latrell Walker&#x85;or so it seems.There are many attempts at irony throughout the movie and surprisingly enough most of them work. Boyd is forced to attend rage control classes in which he meets eccentric TV host Henry Wayne (Tom Arnold) who becomes his wannabe partner. But sadly enough the classes don't work as Boyd continues to uses violence first, ask questions later. And there is a public service announcement too; Seagal survives a car wreck by airbag. A later car crash victim doesn't have one and dies.Dozens of cop movie clich√©s staple the flimsy script together. And the bad guys are obvious from the moment they appear on screen. Bartkowiak's direction is better than in his debut Romeo Must Die, and adds a heavy dose of frenetic rush to such a fast-paced film. However the set-up and execution of the story is so dull you'll forget about it half an hour after the credits roll.Seagal has learned a little, just a little, more in the acting area but still doesn't know how to express himself much. There's too much frowning and not enough other emotions from Boyd. We do want to feel more from him but he won't allow us. I guess this is just how Seagal is. He just can't get away from himself no matter what role he plays. I wish Seagal would try harder, but he just never bothers with making an effort.

You see there was nothing I loved more as a child than watching the movie heros fight the bad guys and ultimately take them out to restore peace to the free world. However, somewhere in the mid-90's, these kind of films (which I have appropriately labelled The Big Dumb Action Movies) became a lost art and gave way to newer more complex action thrillers. In some instances this was for the better and in other instances, let's just say you were left longing for the days of old when Johnny Rambo dashed acrossed a battlefield in the jungle with his extra powerful M-60 machine gun and mowed down some Commie scum. One of the men at the frontline of the old action genre movies was Steven Seagal. His older movies were an action fan's wet dream. They had lots of shooting, lots of brutal fight scenes, and the occasional trademark Seagal staredown. Nevermind the fact that the man couldn't act well even if his children were kidnapped and one of the ransom demands from the kidnappers was for not only $5 million dollars but also for Seagal to play at least one scene in a new movie with a different tone of voice and a different facial expression.But the entertainment was there and when I saw Exit Wounds, I was automatically thrown back into the mind of a young boy all over again. Here's a movie that gives an old fan of action exactly what they could ever hope for. Lots of martial arts, lots of great shootouts, and over the top stunts (maybe with a little bit of help from those damn cables and CGI but let us ignore this for the time being). This movie is a lot of fun and I was glad to see Seagal make a return to the kind of movie that people actually will pay to see him in, even if this is just a one time deal for the pony tail sporting Aikdo artist. If it is simple minded action you crave, then you can't go wrong with Exit Wounds, which is really more of a throwback than anything. When you see the legendary action film veteran Bill Duke on the screen with those crazy eyes, you know you're officially watching a Big Dumb Action Movie.  "},{"Title":"Another rapper in a movie?  What?  You say he's good?","Date":"20 June 2002","Score":"26 out of 43 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  `There are good cops and bad cops,' says Steven Seagal when asked about why he chose to star in the film.The need for such a question, however, is unnecessary. Seagal will forever be known as one of our generation's top action stars. He's been on trains, submarines, and over speeding cars. His ability to dazzle his audience with every punch, kick, and flip earns him the title of one of our generation's most memorable action stars. Seagal is modest about his action power, however, and prefers to be thought of as a professional martial artist.Whatever the case, his latest effort in Exit Wounds is another film in Seagal's library of adrenaline-rushing, macho-type films. Produced by Hollywood honch Joel Silver, Exit Wounds is a high-kicking, edge of your seat thriller that tells the story of a cop named Orin Boyd, sent to another precinct in the rough streets of Detroit, where nothing seems the same. Corruption, deceit, and betrayal lay only three lockers away.Much like Seagal's enjoyment for his work in the martial arts field, Orin Boyd is a person who is genuinely proud of what he does for a living. All of his anger and frustration is a result of his disappointment with how little his job means. In one of the most powerful scenes of the movie, Boyd is shown hanging up his whistle after his demotion to a traffic director. A cop in Detroit is everything Boyd lives to be, and when his occupation becomes meaningless, so does his life.Boyd isn't alone in his stance, however. When $5 million dollars worth of heroin disappears, there is an underlying truth to everything, but nothing seems to make sense. All fingers seem to point at Latrell Walker (DMX), a supposed drug dealer and one of the best.DMX delivers the most engaging performance in Exit Wounds. Much like Boyd, Walker is a character that is typical in most cop films, but also one that the audience can identify with. As every actor should, DMX gives as much personality to Latrell as needed. DMX, as Latrell, shows genuine emotions for his family, his colleagues, and for what stands to be right. A perplexing character with his actions, Latrell definitely serves to grab the audience's attention.Unlike traditional cop films, DMX and Steven Seagal are able to both grab hold of the spotlight of the film, but with their own unique charismas. Seagal and DMX's chemistry does not involve holding hands and dancing into the sun-setting horizon. It is a tense relationship between Latrell and Boyd, and as the movie progresses, the truths about one another are unraveled, with each character prepared to either fight, or work together, for whatever cause each one has.Joel Silver is known for setting the bar with his films, both in the action and story sense. Some of the most incredible action sequences in Exit Wounds will forever be embedded in the Joel Silver legacy. Along with Silver's knack for blood rushing sequences, he is also known for pulling shocks and surprises in his pictures. Exit Wounds is the type of film where one must really keep his eye open, for he might miss an unexpected, but crucial, turning point in the movie.As Steven Seagal's comeback film, he should be grateful that his first picture in the new millennium will forever remind his audiences and fans that he is, indeed, one of the best on-screen heroes of this past decade. As old clashes with new, his counterpart, DMX, has displayed his fresh talent on-screen and sets a challenge for him to take on new film's, with more demanding roles. In an age where hip hop and kung fu can co-exist in entertainment, Exit Wounds proves that films nowadays still have the potential of attracting just about anybody.

The first scene was kind of the beginning joke for the rest of the story. I was laughing when he took matters into his own hands and to avoid allowing the 'Vice President to be killed in a firefight on the bridge with the impostor police officers that were there for a killing 'contract'. The 'Vice' Prez sort of looked like a cross between Al Gore and then 'future' now former Vice Presidential hopeful John Edwards all rolled into one. I laughed because the best expression that this 'Vice' Prez had on the bridge was...-clueless. And from the exotic cars and the crazy players that brought game to the screen, this was a breath of fresh air, that year. I think that Steven Seagal played himself, as he always does but just like John Wayne and other big icons, that's what people generally go to see, these stars being the stars they are. I strongly felt that the action and confrontation between Seagal and DMX was a favorable match-up. Corruption in the heart of the downtown precinct. A couple of 'hood-ole'' boys to fight against and expose it. It's an age old tale, but they pulled this one off very well. I recommend to action and martial-arts fans.

Seagal's career was heading downhill fast, but this movie resurrected his career, and it became a hit. It made 51 million overall in the U.S. Seagal tried to replicate this formula with another hip ensemble cast in Half Past Dead by having another rapper (Ja Rule) but that bombed at the box office, and Seagal has been in STD hell, ever since. I'm honestly not sure why this became a hit for Seagal. It's certainly not bad, but there is really nothing all that special about it. It has plenty of lame comedy, thanks to the unfunny Tom Arnold, and some admittedly funny lines by Steven Seagal. It doesn't embarrass itself in the action department. It has a great opening, and Seagal does do some of his trademark bone crunching, and seems to be relatively in shape, unfortunately&#x85; Seagal's laziness was starting to commence as well. There are some laughable kickboxing moves, which do not seem to be coming from Seagal. The story itself is familiar. Seagal's Orrin Boyd character is a little bit like Serpico. Orrin is a lone wolf, and wants to uncover cop corruption. Sound familiar? Seagal does seem at least somewhat invested into this project. He does have some funny lines, as I stated earlier in the review. I wouldn't call his performance great, but at least signs of his old charisma are here. There is a pivotal moment, involving a death of someone he is close too, and he seems only slightly concerned. I also didn't buy the forced attraction between Seagal & Jill Hennessy. It was always subtle, but it came across as quite awkward. DMX seems very uninterested in his role, and doesn't react to much of anything. He does have a twist which I didn't see coming, but he looked bored. Isaiah Washington does well as Seagal's partner. Anthony Anderson is terribly unfunny in his role. There is a scene between him and Tom Arnold at the end credits, which is supposed to be hilarious, because they are improvising on the fly. It came across as stupid, and unbearable. Michael Jai White has an OK fight scene with Steven Seagal in the finale. It was quite disappointing in all honesty. Tom Arnold's popularity has always befuddled me, and I felt his character was a waste of time. Bruce McGill & Bill Duke add decent support, whilst Eva Mendes is sexy, but that's about it. According to her, she was dubbed by another actress, and hated the film. I couldn't tell if she was dubbed or not. Final Thoughts I thought it was OK.

Boyd's bosses aren't happy, the secret service aren't happy & the Vice President isn't happy so as punishment Boyd is sent to work in Precinct 15, the biggest s-hole in Detroit & undergo anger therapy. Boyd is partnered up with patrol cop George Clark (Isaiah Washington) who quickly stumble across a plot by a gang of corrupt cops to steal impounded heroin from the police lock up & sell it, unsure of who they can trust Boyd & Clark have to go it alone dodging bullets as they try to clean up Precinct 15...This American Australian co-production was directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak & one has to say that Exit Wounds is a pretty ordinary & routine action thriller about some one man army super cop bringing down some drug dealers. The script by Ed Horowitz & Richard D'Ovidio was based on the novel by John Westermann & feels like a mishmash of action film clich√©s cobbled together. There's the obligatory white cop black cop partnership which never actually goes anywhere, the lone maverick cop whose wife left him because of the job & has to go it alone to catch the bad guy's, the predictable plot twists, various fight & action scenes which have little relevance to the story, some awful comedy relief & a fairly routine Hollywood thriller plot about drugs. Nothing really gels that well in Exit Wounds, most of the events seem unconnected & somewhat random. To be fair to Exit Wounds though it passes 100 odd minutes harmlessly enough, it's certainly not the worst film out there & there's one or two memorably spectacular action set-pieces & there's a funny little nod towards the brutality of Seagal's earlier films in that his character is forced to go to anger management therapy in a fairly amusing scene which also pokes a little bit of fun at his weight & that he is getting fatter & fatter with each passing film he makes. Unfortunately to balance that amusing scene out the ending is truly dire with the two main comedy relief character's talking to each other & trying to be funny, a truly embarrassing scene. While there's nothing hugely wrong with Exit Wounds there's nothing that great about it either, basically it's fairly predictable Hollywood stuff saved by some impressive action scenes.Director Bartkowiak does a decent job, the film looks nice with bright cinematography, some nice angles especially during the opening shoot-out on the bridge, there's plenty of clean lines, fast sports cars, hip music & it has a bit of style about it. The action scenes save Exit Wounds, from a huge shoot-out on a bridge to exploding cars to gunfights to martial arts fights to motorbike chases to car chases to all sorts of explosions, property damage & brutality. It actually looks like Seagal put some effort into the fight scenes in Exit Wounds, in fact Exit Wounds is probably the best film Seagal has made during the twenty first century & the last of his big budget Hollywood flicks with Warner Bros. While filming in Hamilton during the scene when the van rolls upside & skids along the street with everyone inside jumping out a stuntman died after the stunt went wrong, this scene was re-shot later which probably cost a lot since it's one of the more expensive looking action scenes in the film. Apparently filming was also delayed when actor David Vadim was arrested & charged with sexual assault by police on the set!With a supposed budget of about $33,000,000 Exit Wounds did OK at the box-office taking about $20,000,000 during it's opening weekend. The film certainly has that big budget Hollywood polish about it & the production values are high & glossy. Set in Detroit but largely filmed in Canada. The acting is alright, Seagal is OK I suppose. When I first saw the credits & saw someone called DMX I thought isn't that a make of bike? But then I realised that's a BMX... Fine character actors such as Tom Arnold, Isaiah Washington, Bill Duke, Jill Henessey & Bruce McGill are all wasted in small roles but the films still definitely better for having them there.Exit Wounds is a pretty routine action thriller that takes most of the Hollywood stereotype's & clich√©s & churns out a reasonable flick with which to pass 100 odd minutes. Exit Wounds is nothing amazing but it's not too bad & the action scenes provide plenty of bang for your money, neither the best action film out there or the worst.

The very diverse cast includesIsaiah Washington, Anthony Anderson, Bruce McGill, Tom Arnold, the gorgeous Jill Hennessy and an outstanding performance from rapper DMX. The story line and very good F/X take back seat to the dervish martial arts combat.DMX not only plays a double roll in this tale of corruption in the toughest precinct of Detroit; but also is featured on the loud and hard hitting soundtrack. The highlight of which is a DMX remake of the Bill Wither's classic Ain't No Sunshine.. When You're Gone.

Seagal is sent to anger management seminars and suspects foul play regulated by members of the police force. He teams with Isaiah Washington to find answers as well as support the whole idea of this being the umpteenth bad buddy cop film. This all arrives at the ever familiar violent solution. Sloppy directing by Andrzei Bartkowiak who throws in the justified violence theme for good measure. Seagal isn't any different here than in any other film where he beats up countless people. The only difference is that here he seems to have an unlimited amount of handcuffs. In really awful supporting roles are Washington as well as DMX and Anthony Anderson. Michael Jai White appears in what is as bad as another film he did called Universal Soldier The Return. What is even worse about this junk is how the audience reacted to it.

I don't look at superficial details like DMX playing himself again, not so believable characters, the overall mediocre acting, lack of logic or the canned story. It's not a Darabont, Nolan or Spielberg. It is simply supposed to be fun and entertaining not to be deep or intelligent. The hard action is very cool and there is a lot of tempo in it. The sense of humor rounds it off. Seagall delivers a good performance and carries the movie well together with his co stars.

For Orin, trying to crack a drug case and getting along with his fellow officers is close to impossible, but when he is signed to work with a reserved partner George Clark (Isaiah Washington), who also realizes that something deep is taking place, their teamwork is what counts. As Orin gets a lead on a Latrell Walker (DMX), and his quirky, comical criminal friend T.K. Johnson (Anthony Anderson).. a game of cat and mouse occurs within the streets of L.A. and a war is taking place. With more evidence coming up from the lead drug dealer Latrell, it becomes apparent that much of the operation is taking place by the cops in Orin's own precinct, and now it's up to Orin to stop the inside dirty work of his own department and restore peace in the city of L.A..Supported cast stars Michael Jai White, Bruce McGill, Bill Duke, and Tom Arnold.This movie was really good.. I recommend this to anyone who is a Seagal fan. Awesome cast, awesome story and really just very awesome action scenes, I mean Seagal plays in a form I have never seen and it convinces me strongly, so concluding this review, I say.. go buy or rent it, which ever you prefer.. it's a darn good action flick, its not a intelligent action flick, but it's one that Seagal really shows his redemption as a action star.By the way, the anger class scenes with Seagal are funny! "},{"Title":"A Hackneyed but High-Octane Urban Crime Thriller","Date":"8 February 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Steven Seagal manages a successful big-screen comeback in director Andrzej Bartkowiak's Exit Wounds, a hackneyed but high octane, urban crime thriller co-starring rapper DMX and Spawn star Michael Jai White, with comedians Anthony Anderson and Tom Arnold. Seagal's popularity as an atypical action hero who wore a prissy little ponytail as well as prayer beads peaked with director Andrew Davis' 1992 blockbuster Under Siege. Afterward, Seagal let his waistline bloat to Buddha-like proportions, and he started dressing like Sitting Bull. Worse, he used his movies as a soapbox to preach about environmental issues. Seagal's last outing in the 1998 militia melodrama The Patriot, where he played a single parent doctor raising a young daughter, never attracted a major studio to distribute it and premiered on cable television. Essentially, Seagal's career appeared washed-up, and then Lethal Weapon/The Matrix producer Joel Silver offered him a deal he couldn't refuse. If Seagal cut the ponytail, dressed inconspicuously, and shed weight, Silver promised to produce his comeback film. Happily, not only as Seagal lost the ponytail and slimmed down considerably, but he also ridicules his weight and ego problems throughout Exit Wounds. John Westermann's novel about police corruption serves as the basis for the entertaining but formulaic Ed (On Deadly Ground) Horowitz and Rich (Thirteen Ghosts) D'Ovidio screenplay. Horowitz & D'Ovidio recycle plot elements from Don Siegel's Dirty Harry, Sidney Lumet's Serpico, John Sturges' McQ, John Glen's License to Kill, Richard Donner's Lethal Weapon 3, and Brett Ratner's Money Talks. Although Seagal has modified his image cosmetically, he portrays the same soft-spoke, anti-authoritarian, Neanderthal Dirty Harry type who willingly breaks the law to uphold it. Exit Wounds recalls Andrew Davis' Above the Law (1988), John Flynn's Out for Justice (1991), and John Gray's The Glimmer Man (1996) with Seagal cast as an insubordinate cop.The action opens with a bang. The Vice President (Christopher Lawford of Thirteen Days) delivers an anti-gun control speech, and maverick Detroit cop Orin Boyd (Steven Seagal) save his life when a right-wing militia group ambushes the Vice President's motorcade on a bridge with enough firepower to ignite World War III. Predictably, the grossly incompetent Secret Service complains about Orin's unsolicited intervention, and his bureaucratic superiors punish him for his heroism. They transfer him to the most dangerous, crime-riddle precinct in the Motor City where his boss is a woman. Precinct Captain Annette Mulcahy (Jill Hennessy of Most Wanted) orders Orin to attend a Fight Club style anger management class where he encounters a loquacious Jerry Springer-type TV talk show host, Henry Wayne (Tom Arnold of True Lies). Seagal prostrates himself throughout Exit Wounds. When he tries to stand up in the anger-management class, he finds it difficult to get out of the desk because his stomach is too big. Later, in an outright reference to Lethal Weapon 3, Orin walks a beat and has to direct traffic.Eventually, Orin uncovers a ring of crooked cops and a mystery man, Latrell Walker (rapper DMX of Belly) on the right side of the law for a change), who behaves like a drug dealer. Latrell and his sidekick, well-heeled nightclub owner T.K. (Anthony Anderson of Me, Myself & Irene), saunter into a new car dealership with a duffel bag filled with $300-thousands dollars to buy a Lamborghini Diablo off the showroom floor just for fun. Interestingly, an African-American car salesman displays nothing but contempt for Latrell while a shrewd white salesman helps Latrell out and wins the commission. Exit Wounds stands racial profiling on its head and tweaks it for comedy by having another African-American use it against one of his own. Everything that Latrell does categorizes him unmistakably as a gangsta. Ironically, Latrell is only trying to spring his wrongly accused brother from jail and expose the dirty cops that who put him there to take the heat off one of their own protected drug dealers. In fact, both Latrell and his brother Shaun are millionaires several times over, so Exit Wounds shuns the stereotypical depiction of blacks as despicable drug dealers and presents its young black males as members of the nouveau riche who acquired their wealth legally. We learn Latrell made his fortune as a dot.com creator who knew when to bail before the bubble bursts, while Shaun awaits his 25th birthday to inherit a mega-trust fund fortune.Producer Joel Silver and sophomore helmer Andrzej Bartkowiak replicate the formula that succeeded so well for them in the profitable Romeo Must Die, but doesn't work as well for Seagal. They give the first half of the movie to Seagal, introduce DMX about 40 minutes later, flesh out the relationships between the heroes and the villains, let Seagal collide with DMX so they can team up and battle the baddies. Unfortunately, the second half of Exit Wounds doesn't measure up to the first.Seagal fans will appreciate the testosterone-laced violence and ample frontal female nudity. Silver & Bartkowiak indulge their squinty-eyed star and give him one of his signature scenes where, although outnumbered, he decimates the opposition with disarming ease. Seagal catches a gang of delinquents in the act of trying to break into his new Dodge Ram truck. The aim of grand theft auto, he tells them, is breaking into a vehicle quickly, and then he unlocks his truck with his remote control to their surprise. While Seagal acts like an indestructible action hero when he guns down dozens of villains and kicks another dozen butts, Exit Wounds varies by thrusting him into hair-raising scenes where his life appears in jeopardy. Things really shift into overdrive when the bad guys heist 50 kilos of heroin from the precinct's property vaults. Just as predictably, Latrell joins forces with Orin to bring these dastards down! Although Exit Wounds doesn't top Under Siege, it shows a freshly resilient Steven Seagal in better form than his last two films F√©lix Enr√≠quez Alcal√° Fire Down Below and The Patriot.

No more Seagal taking on thirty guys who have guns with his bare hands, here he's just a regular cop who happens to know aikido. Like, really well. Also, putting his character in anger management class is a pretty good fetch, I'm sure the writers patted themselves on the back for hours when they came up with that. The Tom Arnold cameo was really not necessary and annoyed the crap out of me, that should be said, but it was funny stuff nonetheless. Another novelty not every scene centers around Seagal, he shares his position with equally great actors like DMX and some fat guy. It's not as bad as it sounds I guess. Also, for a Steven Seagal movie this is actually pretty unpredictable, it takes more than three seconds to figure out how it will end.

Although when FDB was reaching its end, I still cared. The same thing cannot be said about the the Patriot. By the time it ended, I was glad it was over. Something had happened with Seagal's movies--there was less action, more Seagal looking at someone with a mean look on his face.

They actually don't partner up until the end of the movie, but the scenes where they fight each other are quite enthralling. When they finally do hook up, it's cool. The second problem is in one scene when Seagal boosts a motorcycle to outrun someone. Except for the closeup shots of Seagal on the bike, in every shot you could see the stunt double.

Exit Wounds is a curious mixture of Seagal vehicle, urban thriller, and Hong Kong style martial arts film. Though it is wildly uneven, there are some great stunts and good fights. Also be sure to watch the hilarious conversation during the end credits between Anthony Anderson and Tom Arnold.The plot kind of chases it's tail around until finally resolving itself more or less in a violent shootout in a warehouse. Basically it involves Steven Seagal as an aging Detroit policeman who has a tough time following orders. (don't they all in these movies?) After saving the vice president's life in an early shootout, Seagal is punished(!) by being transferred to a tougher precinct. Seagal is not there long before he finds numerous corrupt cops up to no good. The plot eventually stumbles into heroin smuggling and something to do with rapper DMX trying to get his brother out of jail or something. Anyway, just watch the butt-kicking and don't worry so much about the plot. Trust me on this one. Most of the action is very well staged. A paunchy and at times old-looking Seagal whoops his share of butt. He also shoots many, many people. Isaiah Washington, Michael Jai White, and DMX also flex their respective muscles. Most of the fight scenes are shot using the Hong Kong style of putting everyone on wires and having them swoop through the air between punches and kicks. It actually looks pretty neat.Filming was plagued by numerous problems. Seagal badly injured a knee but kept on filming. The early shootout on the bridge had to be shot during two different seasons due to technical problems! Yes! In some shots it is summertime and in others there is snow on the ground plainly visible! Supporting actor David Vadim was arrested and charged with a sexual assault right on the set. Worst of all, a stuntman was killed during a scene involving a van flipping over! Sheesh!!! At least the film still made a little money and kept Seagal relevant for a little longer anyway.

While it is good to see him back in form (even if he has put on a little bit of weight) after a sharp decline in his popularity, the rest of Exit Wounds suffers from a lot of cop movie clich√©s and a plot that really just moves through the motions of the typical cop movie.Other than that, Seagal's acting and fighting style haven't changed. He still snaps and breaks limbs with his black-belt Aikido mastery, kills lots of bad guys and saves the day, all without so much as even raising his voice. In Detroit, Michigan, Seagal is hard-boiled street cop Orin Boyd, who is busted down to patrolman after saving the vice president from a gang of would-be assassins on a bridge. It turns into a fiasco for the Secret Service when Boyd tosses the V.P. over the bridge and into the river, and as a result Boyd is sent to the 15th Precinct, the worst in Detroit.It is here that Boyd knocks heads with many of the other officers and becomes waist-deep in police corruption, and stumbles upon their connection to a shady street hustler, Latrell Walker (DMX). The bad cops want Boyd out of the way, so he's busted down even further to crossing guard (this scene alone will get a lot of laughs just to see Seagal doing a few comedic hi-jinks that really seem out of character). (There is also another comic scene where Boyd is sent to an anger management class and busts up a desk when trying to get up out of it after being asked to introduce himself.) But he does find some allies in fellow cops George Clark (Isaiah Washington), Strutt (Michael Jai White), and tough-as-nails Commander Mulcahy (Jill Hennessy).Exit Wounds, adapted from the novel by John Westermann, comes to us from blood-letting Lethal Weapon and Matrix producer Joel Silver, and director Andrzej Bartkowiak (who was at the helm of Jet Li's 2000 American starring debut Romeo Must Die). While Exit Wounds does not do much to change the formulaic cops & robbers theme, it gets by plenty on the strength of Seagal. But this isn't classic Seagal, unfortunately. Exit Wounds was released on the heels of the popularity of The Matrix (1999) and as such, was one of the many action flicks to try to use wire-fu (a technique borrowed from Chinese wuxia films where actors are attached to wires that are eliminated in post-production using CGI to make them seem like they can defy gravity).While it might make sense to see Seagal get with the times, it doesn't fit his Aikido skills. It's very troubling to see a martial artist as skilled as him have to rely on such technology. It's just not like him to go that far. I want to see Seagal snap limbs the old-fashioned way since that's what I'm used to seeing him do and want to see him continue doing. DMX wasn't really all that convincing either as the thug-with-a-heart-of-gold, who eventually comes to be Boyd's closest ally on the street (he was really much better as a supporting figure in Romeo Must Die). And Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson also appear as comic relief sidekicks television personality Henry Wayne and T.K., respectively, and the two do have one hilarious dialogue during the credits.Exit Wounds isn't a total failure just because Steven Seagal is here and is given something to do. But his popularity for a new generation of fans was short-lived following the failure of Half Past Dead the year after, in which Seagal again relied on fancy technology to get with the times. It's just that we want to see the old Seagal; rolling with the new isn't always a good thing, you know.5/10 "},{"Title":"DMX in a breakthrough performance","Date":"3 April 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" OK, this is a Steven Segal film, but it is one of his better ones.

I readily accept that an action movie does not have to be an artistic masterpiece, but this one went really low into the gutter, especially considering the cast involved.The screenplay is un-involving, in some instances doesn't even make much sense, it is totally unbelievable. The casting is ridiculous (just have a look at the precinct commander, and if you find her believable in her role...). To make things worse for an action movie, even the fighting scenes are not very good either. Most of them are way over the top, and Steven Seagal is by no means up to most of the stuff he is supposed to be doing in them. He looks overweight, slow and totally out of shape (so considering his acting talent, there's nothing left). It would have been much better if he had stayed in 'retirement'. Avoid if possible.

Seagal is also a lot more plump and his fight sequences rely more on camera trickery to disguise the fact that he's really getting to old for this crap. That being said Exit Wounds is probably Seagal's best movie since Under Siege. However that says very little, especially given his quality.

From the opening scenes, the viewer is gripped by the amount of action, and I was drawn in by the idea of men dressed as police officers attacking the vice president. There was a wonderful sense of panic as a voice over the radio demanded that no police be allowed on the bridge.The story was actually very good, and gave a bit more depth than Segal just running round shooting and beating stuff up. The crosses and double crosses worked very well, and the plot moved with energy and pace.The acting was of a fairly high quality, and all of the major characters really did work as more than caricatures. David Vadim was particularly good, switching sides continuously with ease. Steven Segal carried off the scenes with a touch of humour, but also class, and his fight scenes still worked well. DMX was a little flat early on, but soon settled into his character, and considering the fairly complex plot points, did well. Anthony Anderson was faultless (as the end-credit sequence with Tom Arnold proves), and it was brilliant to see the super cool Bill Duke kicking some ass again.The music was a little heavy-handed, with a little too much rap and hip/hop music, but considering a rapper was in it, that wasn't too much of a surprise. However, scenes with Segal framed by that kind of music did seem a little out of place.The dialogue also suffered slightly from a forced hand, especially in scenes with urban characters. It was almost as if the writers didn't know how characters like that would talk, and so they just inserted swear words into every sentence. However, as the plot began to develop, the dialogue became more important, and the stereotypes did drop.The stunts and fight sequences were really the best part of this film. They were filmed with such clarity, that nothing is missed. Shoot-outs had brutal hits and loud, unedited gun shots. Fight scenes had an air of realism, and vehicle stunts were fantastic to watch.A good film to watch, that served its purpose and more. One of the better Segal films.

It's actually a pretty good movie, with a decent cast and acceptable plot. There are some impressive martial arts moves from the old man, and some welcome light relief from the excellent Anthony Anderson, who alone is worth the entrance fee.Quite a high body count, and at least one surprising (to me anyway) death mean this is not one for the squeamish, but the violence isn't really excessive. There are some good comic moments, but overall the mood is far too dark to even remotely suggest it is intended to be funny - apart from at the end credits.

Busted down to traffic cop he gets a chance at real police work again by working the beat with a partner, but things quickly heat up as signs of extensive corruption begin to show and the good guys might not be that good at all.The title is mysteriously irrelevant to this film's story, but it pretty cool for a thriller nonetheless. The film also stars DMX, which puts it in the now world famous franchise known as Seagal and the Rappers. OK, just kidding about that.The film is pretty much what you'd expect from Under Siege era Seagal and that might be refreshing breeze for fans who have had to suffer through garbage like Fire Down Below and The Patriot. The story is interesting, though the trailer gives it all away, but it is not like it wasn't predictable to begin with. Seagal was never about the story department anyway and the movie's real entertainment is the action. Fight scenes, shootouts, chases, car crashes, explosions and general mayhem are all here to please the target audience and with undoubtedly do so. The cast is also pretty good, from the intimidating looking Bill Duke to the boyish looking David Vadim the film makes a seemingly unintentional statement about looks not being everything about a person.

"},{"Title":"Seagal's movies are getting bad and it's not even his fault!","Date":"7 February 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Steven Seagal is one of those action heroes that has a certain brand of action films that are not for all tastes but certainly not without entertainment value. I personally love watching his films, just because his enormously unrealistic brand of fighting is both so characteristic of him and also because it's just fun to watch, even if a lot of it is so clearly contrived and totally fake. He's fun to watch in the same goofy way that people like Jackie Chan and Van Damme are fun to watch. It's not real likely that this kind of thing can happen in real life, but it is certainly entertaining nonetheless. However, even this larger than life fighting style can be taken too far. Exit Wounds starts off with a politician reciting enormously disturbing (and TRUE) facts about gun violence in America to a crowd while on his campaign for office. So from the very beginning you know what to expect. If you keep in mind that this is a movie that immediately gets you thinking about how terrible the gun situation in this country is and then turns around and literally kills dozens of people with machine guns within the first three minutes of the film, you know how far the intellectual content is meant to go. This is not only a movie that is not intended to get you thinking, it is specifically a movie that is intended NOT to get you thinking. If you're still thinking about the epidemic of gun violence in America four minutes into the film, you've already missed the point. But the movie makes its first unforgiving mistake here, because this is a point that should NEVER be forgotten.Even Seagal's morbidly entertaining brand of fighting is overdone here and made fake and uninteresting by the efforts to make it look all high tech and fancy, vainly trying to copy Matrix-like slow motion and anti-gravity moves, neither of which do anything but make you sigh and slap your forehead. I can't say that I wasn't at all entertained by the fighting scenes in the film, but there are just some inexcusable things like the scene where Boyd (Seagal) walks out of a court-ordered anger management class (after tearing his desk apart because he got stuck in it) to find a bunch of hoodlums trying to break into his brand new Dodge pickup truck, which still has the factory sticker on the window (this is the only commercial that Dodge apparently could afford to put in the film. Mercedes commercials, on the other hand, filled the rest of the movie). Boyd gets out to his truck and finds, as always, one of those groups of car thieves that are somehow under the impression that it takes the whole gang to break into a single car, and if the owner shows up, it's probably best to stay there and talk to him until he beats the hell out of everyone than to scatter and move on to a different car. Boyd puts his smack down and his whole anger management class runs outside and cheers. The event is a success, because Boyd has made his fellow rage-aholics happy, but as always, he grunts and gets into his truck and speeds away.In fact, probably the only person who looks less happy than Boyd in the film is Latrell Walker, a curious character played surprisingly well by DMX, at least as far as the character that he's given, who is angry and mysterious in a criminal way as long as the screenplay needs him to be, before immediately lightening up and turning into a completely different person so that the movie can have a twist. This is weak screenwriting in its most spectacular form. DMX mumbles his way through the first half of the movie, looking about as happy as your average rapper on the cover of your average rap CD/magazine/poster/movie/music video/etc. (spoilers) It turns out that Walker is working undercover to expose a group of corrupt cops and to free his brother from wrongful imprisonment, and neither has a clue in the moon how to do this until the screenplay needs them to. We see a couple scenes of Walker's (or, in this case, Leon Rollins, his un-undercover name) brother talking to Boyd and doing everything he possibly can to convince Boyd and us that he really is a criminal and has a lot to hide. Evidently the weak screenwriting doesn't stop with the character of his brother. Walker/Rollins is independently wealthy, and the fact that he buys $285,000 cars by tossing a duffel bag full of cash at a salesman and saying, `There's $300,000&#133;Keep the change,' leads you to believe that he is, in fact, involved with the massive amount of drugs that infiltrate the entire film. The later revelation that he runs a freaking WEBSITE called `999.com' (Everything you could want for under a dollar) is probably the weakest bit of screenwriting in the entire movie.Exit Wounds does, in fact, have a good amount of twists in it, and twists are a good way to make a boring movie interesting. But it doesn't throw these twists in at an unexpected moment and therefore get a good reaction from the audience as much as it deliberately misleads us to believe one thing and then completely turns around and throws in all this other stuff to completely cancel out everything that it's said so far. It leads us very carefully by the hand in one direction, and then out of the blue shoves us in the opposite direction. In this case, backwards. This structure is embodied perfectly in a scene late in the film where Boyd and Walker confront each other and start fighting. They fight viciously for a minute or two, and then at the drop of a hat, Walker gets knocked to the ground and says, `You want to see what's really going on? Follow me.' At which point Boyd forgets everything he's ever known about any kind of enemy and casually follows Walker into his own territory, which could be filled with all of his buddies and all of their guns if he hadn't immediately decided that hey, we're friends now. He would never do anything to hurt me.Quality or quantity is a choice that you have to make, and in this case, there is a large quantity of plot twists, none of which have any quality at all. About half way through the film the plot jerks you around so much that by the end you want to just turn off the movie and lay down for a while. Action films are supposed to thrill you, not wear you out by taunting you to try to keep up with the twists. The movie tries to be interesting by piling on all these twists (maybe in an effort to make up for the botched martial arts), but if they really wanted to be interesting they might have thought to try to throw in there somewhere a reason that the movie was called Exit Wounds in the first place, other than to have a hugely unappealing title. The justification for such a repellent title may have been more interesting than anything else in the movie.

The action movie has been away from the screen for far too long. At one time Chuck Norris, Jean Claude Van Damme, and Steven Seagal ruled the cinema.  Chuck got out of the big screen and into television at the right time, Van Damme disappeared into direct to video, and Seagal seemed to have bloated himself out of existence.  His last movie was a direct to video joke. Thankfully the studios took a chance on this one and let the action fans get what they wanted. 	Seagal plays Orin Boyd, the longer cop with an attitude.  After spectacularly saving the Vice-President from a terrorist attack he is bumped down to the most unholy of precincts.  This is the place nobody wants to go.  Crime is running rampant through the streets and the cops seem unable to do a thing about it. 	After a disastrous meeting with his new commander Boyd finds himself in an anger management meeting where he meets celebrity wanna-be Henry Wayne, played by Tom Arnold.  The two interrupt an attempted theft of Boyd's truck in true Seagal fashion.  Later that night Boyd sees a drug transaction taking place.  He is able to capture one man but Latrell Walker, rap star DMX, and his associate T.K., played by Anthony Anderson, escape.  Much to Boyd's disgust he finds the guy he busted is an undercover cop. 	Even more to Boyd's disgust he is busted first down to traffic cop and after that fails he is partnered on the beat with the idealistic young George Clark, Isaiah Washington.  Boyd is able to convince George to help him track down Latrell and T.K. They find to their horror that Latrell and T.K. may not be the bad guys that they thought they were and the cops may actually be behind most of the drug running on the street. 	Okay, that's the basic plot and I admit it&#133;it sounds silly. But guess what? You don't go to a Seagal movie for the plot or the character development.  You go for the action scenes and maybe if you are lucky some funny dialogue. Does the movie succeed in that aspect? Oh Yeah! 	Andrzej Bartkowiak shows much the same skill directing this feature as he did with his previous movie, Romeo Must Die.  In fact many of the faces from Romeo also appear in this film.  Bartkowiak keeps the story moving at a quick pace and lets the action speak for the rest of the film.  The fight scenes are all choreographed well. 	Seagal seems to have lost weight and got back into more of a fighting trim with this one.  His action scenes are more in depth than anything he has done in awhile and he even takes a bow to his age with letting the younger bad guy in essence win.  The key to his performance though is the fact that he looks back to his previous success in Under Siege and plays this role for laughs.  He still delivers his lines with the strangely serious gaze but there is a glint of a smirk in everything he says. 	Rap star DMX does a fine job too. He handles all the lines well and doesn't force anything off the screen.  The comedy is provided in this movie on two fronts.  One being from Anthony Anderson's character T.K., acting strangely similar to his character in Romeo&#133; and the other front being from Tom Arnold.  Both are adept at reeling off lines in a rapid pace and one of the funniest scenes in the movie occurs during the credits when the two are just firing things back and forth. 	Is this movie ever going to win an Oscar? No way, but judging on some of the movies that one this year, that doesn't say as much as it used to.  Does it succeed in delivering escapist fun? Oh Yeah!

The guy seemed to be sentenced of into b-movielimbo after Glimmer man but this is his comeback, and one for the better in my opinion. Almost everything that was annoying about Seagal to a lot of people has been removed; the ponytail, the zenwisdoms, the seriousness... however, he's still a cop and he's still breaking' bones like pretzels. Apart from a couple of small plotholes (Driving in a yellow Hummer borrowed from Latrell who's undercover immediately gives away Latrell as soon as Seagal is spotted in the Hummer) the story is pretty decent, at least for a Seagal movie.Most of his past movies were simple revenge flicks, this tries to do something different for the man. The styling is very smooth and can be compared to Romeo must die. The hiphopbeats, cool cars, snappy action and nice cast work good. This movie can be seen in some extent as the sequel to RMD due to the styling and cast (a couple of cast members also have roles in RMD). Of course, no selfrespecting actionflick can miss humour and there's plent of it in Exit Wounds, mostly provided by Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson but Seagal himself also provides a laugh or two throughout the movie, hell the man even laughs himself! All in all a good actionmovie which is sure to please you for 1,5 hour if you don't have prejudice grudge against Seagal.7/10 "},{"Title":"A return to form for Seagal.","Date":"28 May 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I thought the cast for One Night Stand was intriguing; Exit Wounds has the unlikely combo of Steven Seagal, Earl DMX Simmons, Jill Hennessy, and Tom Arnold. Amazingly, this one works great. BTW, the Video Movie Guide gave this one **. Yeah, these losers are already planning to pin ***** on Star WarsAttack Of The Clones.Steven Seagal was one of the top action stars of the early 90's. Starting with the underated Hard To Kill and all the way to his smash hit Under Siege, he was the best in his genre. Yeah, most of his films had him as nothing more than a one man gang, killing and maiming everything in his path, but they were well written, directed, and his brand of martial arts was second-to-none.However, his career went south with his directorial debut On Deadly Ground with its heavy-handed environmental messages. After some success with Under Siege 2, his career was all but buried with the flops The Glimmer Man, Fire Down Below (another environmental story), and Patriot. Seagal decided to take some time off to regroup, and three years later, he returns with a flourish with Exit Wounds, and it was a hit, and hopefully, the now-wisened Seagal can continue to have success despite being 50+.Seagal plays Detroit Det. Orin Boyd, who is demoted to serve in Detroit's tough 15th district after he went overboard in killing all the members of a terrorist group who were trying to kidnap/kill the U.S. Vice-President (a good opener, reminiscent of a video game). He then gets involved in a case involving the mysterious whereabouts of Latrell Walker, played by DMX. He learns that Walker has multiple identities, but he doesn't know whether he's a good cop, a bad cop, or a civilian. Also, he learns of corrupt cops in his district who are in cahoots with drug dealers and gets the help of Detroit AM Talk show host Henry Wayne (Tom Arnold) to help him solve the case, as well as his partner, played by Isaiah Washington.This isn't a no-brainer; I was interested in seeing what would become of Walker. Also, there is some inventive violence in the fight scenes, with swordplay and a neat scene where DMX uses a powerful shotgun in a manner where he throws it straight in the air, but he has a strap tied to the trigger that allows him to shoot it by pulling on the strap. The acting is decent (although Seagal will never be more than a fair actor) and it goes quickly. I have to say that Anthony Anderson has some potential in Hollywood, his supporting role as DMX's friend is superb and he adds comic relief along with Arnold. This movie was surprisingly good. The DVD version contains two documentaries, one of which features Anthony Anderson on a day of shooting; he shows you how hard the acting biz is, and that there should be a case made for the $25 million a movie types (as well as lower talents in the food chain), that they have to work 70-80 hours a week to make a film. I think he made a good point.BTW, although the film is set in Detroit, it was actually shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. You'll see the CN Tower in the skyline as well as other notable buildings, as well as Tim Horton's Donuts, The Bay. and Pizza Pizza. Of course, you'll need the DVD to see these places clearly.

Anyway, along with being a horrible rapper, DMX is also a horrible actor. Wouldn't it have been wise to pair this horrible actor up with a good actor to at least justify his film time? What does Joel My kung fu films are better than REAL kung fu films Silver do? He pairs him up with Steven Segal, a guy who only acts stiff in all his films. This ci-fi comedy has Segal who all of a sudden has Matrix-inspired kung fu and can punch fat dudes yards away, fly in the air, and break glass like if it was toast. DMX can now walk on walls, fire guns with his belt, and sommersualt like he was actually given the talent to do so by an ancient Egyptian god. The fight scenes are aweful, the film itself is pretty gay (alot of Michael Jai White topless and barely no women in the film, with the lone female lead who dies later with no emotion from any of the characters involved.) DMX is very hateable in this film (he should have stayed the bad guy but it would have offended black folks so the bad guys are a white and black man instead--Segal takes on the bad black and DMX takes on the bad white. It balances out, see? If you want Kung fu, there are better films. If you want Segal, believe it or not he's done better films. If you want a rap star in a film, there are better films.

Not so much because he can do the kickboxing, knife-throwing, somersaulting thing, but because of his soft-spoken charm.  He's not a subtle actor but for this kind of role he's a more than capable one.  So compelling is his quiet sincerity (even while delivering weak one-liners) that you don't stop to question why he, almost alone out of everyone in the world, is utterly incorruptible.  Neither Seagal's performance nor the script tells us; but then, neither needs to.That, among other reasons, is why it simply won't wash to defend inexpressibly bad rubbish like this on the grounds that it's a Steven Seagal film.  So what?  Bad is bad, and this is so bad that it makes Bartkowiak's previous feature, Romeo Must Die (which, I might as well admit for the record, wasn't bad) look like a rare cinematic jewel.  It had a story.  What betrayal there was wasn't senselessly complicated to the point of not mattering any more.  The music wasn't great but it wasn't so dopey as to be vile.  I can't recall how often, if at all, it tried to be funny, but at least it didn't try and fail.  Some elements were fresh.  The fight scenes were coherently staged.  (Get a load of the final fight scene in Exit Wounds EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER is involved, in some way or other, yet it's so unmotivated and unimaginative and confusingly shot that we'd have a hard time keeping track of what everyone was doing if there were just three or for people.)  How stale is Exit Wounds?  Hard to say.  It smells as if it's been growing mould for about twenty-five years, but at no point in the past twenty-five years (at no point in history) would a film like this have been fresh.It even manages to get worse still in the opening credits.  One of the supporting actors is Tom Arnold, who does the same venal schtick that was for the most part endearing in True Lies (here, of course, it isn't), as a schlocky talk show host.  Well, over the end credits, for no obvious reason, we get to see his schlocky talk show.  My god!  The sound of a tooth being drilled has nothing on this.  If you've been living in a cave and honestly have no idea how bad American talk shows are you might want to see the footage out of anthropological curiosity, but I suspect it was included to drive people out of cinemas so that the projectionist could stop rolling a minute or two early.

I have been eagarly awaiting Steven's return to making films again after a rather extended period of inactivity.  I was disappointed by this film.Several factors contributed to my opinion.  First, the use of wire-work has no place in a film like this, and the fact that Steven Seagal didn't look anything like Nico Toscani, despite the man being 50 years old now, came from this effect.  Where are the fast, tight leg sweeps... the devastating ridge-hand strikes, etc from the early days?  Where is the CHOREOGRAPHY that Seagal used to write himself?Modern action fans want to be stunned by fighters turning incredible flips and jumping higher than is humanly possible, I suppose because all the other stuff has been done before.  Well, to me, this detracts from the overall presentation because there is no one 'hero' to look up to.  I am saddened that Seagal jumped on the 'pop' band wagon, even if he is trying to break back onto the scene.  I hope his next film will feature the type of action his true fans know and love.Another factor was DMX.  Casting this guy in a motion picture with a role as involved as this character is ridiculous.  This guy is the same whether he's counting money, or dodging bullets.  After about 10 minutes of watching his portrayal, I was reminded of Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone.  The mannerisms, the stale read-the-lines-aloud performance, these were identical to Macaulay Culkin's in Home Alone - the difference - Culkin was 9 years old!DMX's acting coach could have spent a bit more time with him, and judging from the overall rating this movie received, I don't think I'm alone in my opinions of it.  The only thing this picture has going for it is a few big names, none of which amount to much.  I understand the marketing concept Use Seagal to bring in his old fans, use DMX to add 'flavor' and bring in the newer generation, some of whom maybe have not even heard of Seagal.  Those people will think, man, what was all the fuss about Steven Seagal, he couldn't even beat DMX...Do you think Richie ever got a shot in on Gino, let alone a dozen of them... I don't think so.

I rented this tape because I was a fan of Jill Hennessy's from Law and Order. believe me, if that is your motivation, it is the wrong one. Jill is in four scenes a cute meet in which Seagal doesn't realize that she's his boss; A scene where she sticks her head into the locker room while some of the men are changing clothes; a scene in a restaurant in which Seagal tells her date to get lost and she has to pretend to be attracted to old stone face and an extended car chase scene where she becomes the 47th person in this flick to go through a window.That's what the movie is really about people going through windows. The plot make little sense. Seagal graduated from the Easter Island school of acting. The humor is unfunny to anyone not smoking anything. It's all really about people flying through glass. If that's your thing, fine. It wasn't mine. But it did get me to thinking.It seems to me that action films are the modern equivalent of the old Hollywood musical. Both feature silly plots that only serve as a conduit for the real reason people came to see the film. they also feature performers who are better at what they were really hired to do than they are at acting. The old musicals were about singing and dancing. They look great is a That's Entertainment format in which all we see is the singing and dancing, (and only the best of that). They seem less great when you sit through the whole film and look at your watch, waiting for the people to begin doing what they are really good at. The modern action film is similarly constructed, (as is the modern porno film, come to think of it), except that the big scenes are not about singing and dancing but about kicking people through windows, mowing them down with machine guns or smashing up cars and making things explode.Personally, I'd rather see Fred Astaire dance than Steven Seagal kick people though windows. Dances and songs celebrate life and humanity and are full of variety. Action films , (and the pornos), don't seem to have anything to celebrate. And they all look the same.

After viewing some of the crappy movies that Segal had been putting out over the last few years, this one seemed like a return to his earlier films. Though it is...it is still a disappointment.Segal plays Boyd, a police officer, who after a rather unfavorable way of rescuing the vice-president (?) of the United States in Detroit, is demoted to the worst precindt in the city. The 15th Precindt. Here, Boyd learns of a group of corrupt cops, and tries to bring them down.The story is a little jumbled, and hard to follow. However, some of the fight scenes are the best that we have seen in years from cool guy Steve. Also, DMX holds up pretty well for a newbie in the motion picture industry.Bonus points do go to the makers of the movie, for using the city of Toronto as the city of Detroit. However, this fact still cannot save this predictable action flick.If you are a fan of Seagal's, then this one is definately for you.

Above the Law had a good story and was brutal. Out For Justice and especially Marked for Death were very brutal and Under Siege was both brutal and exciting. (Seagal also has a small role in one of the most exciting movies ever Executive Decision.)But unfortunately his movies has become worse and worse, the violence has been toned down over the years, he started to have environmental messages in a couple of movies and here we are now with Exit Wounds.I have heard that it was a box office success but that only tells you something about todays movie audience, consisting of 15 year old kids.  Exit Wounds is Seagals worst movie. The violence is not brutal enough and the movie is ruined by childish boring humor that takes away all realism. The story is very standard, we have seen it all before, there is no excitement and it is of course predictable.  DMX also contributes in ruining the movie. He is some popular (c)rap artist among the kids so why not use him in a movie ? He must be just as tough as Seagal so his fans won¬¥t be disappointed. Everything in the movie is not worthless though. The first action scene, the shooting on the bridge, is good and there are OK fighting scenes, even though nothing comes close to the scenes in for instance Marked for Death.Everyone is complaining that Seagal is a bad actor, but I have never seen a movie ruined by his acting. On the contrary, no one of his movies would be worth seeing if Seagal had been replaced with another actor. And, since he has the same role in all his movies, I think nobody can tell how good or bad he is as an actor, because there is never anything wrong with his performances in this role as a standup toughguy. Seagal has charisma, he has pondus, you can clearly see that you better not mess with this guy.You will not fall asleep during Exit Wounds, but if you are over fifteen you will be disappointed. Please, Steven Seagal, if you are reading this, bring us back the old ultraviolent Seagal, you used to be so brutal that I was laughing.

From the producer of the Matrix! Same Hong Kong fight choreographer from Romeo must die... DMX as the co-star...Comic relief by Tom Arnold...Political intrigue...Unfortunately, bad writing and HORRIBLE editing made this movie impossible to stomach.What's wrong with this movie? Only enough room to give you the SHORT list 1.)Many movies have an unrelated scene at the beginning just to introduce us to the main character, by showing how he reacts in a given situation(see The Score). This usually works well. In Exit Wounds, however, this intro scene takes almost 20 minutes. It leaves us wondering just what the HECK the vice president has to do with the plot of this movie. 2.)DMX is a HORRIBLE actor. I simply assumed he would be good because ALL rappers are good actors, right? (e.g. Will Smith, Ice Cube, Ice T, Queen Latifa, Ton Loc, etc.) But DMX just SUCKS!! And Steven is not a good actor anyway, so to see the rapper and the martial artist both trying to act in the same scene, with no one to carry them is PAINFUL. 3.) The editing was SO choppy. There is NO pacing, NO discernible climax. It sucks.The only reason to watch this movie is for the fight scenes, which are cool, as usual for Steven Segal. Especially the scene where he jumps over the car.I give it a 3/10 on my Steven Segal scale (Hard to Kill being a 10 and Dangerous Ground being a 5).

Starring Steven Seagal, DMX, Isaiah Washington, Tom Arnold. Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak Viewed DVD Tuesday, August 28, 2001. (235)     There seems to be a significant problem in a film when its' plot is unrolled comprehensively in the final half-hour. Such is the case for Steven Seagal's latest action foray &#145;Exit Wounds'. Judging from Hollywood's latest fixation with hip-hop, old school action flicks featuring bass pounding soundtracks by various rap artists that have seemingly turned a profit; producer Joel Silver sticks with the same formula and reteams with &#145;Romeo Must Die' Director Andrzej Bartkowiak to deliver this questionable action flick.       Upon close observation, this film could have been a lot worse. The film bases itself in a great Detroit city yet seemingly it looks a lot like Toronto. From great Canadian retail chain The Bay to giant donut chain Tim Hortons, these are just a few examples of the many slip-ups that occur in this film. The only element keeping us watching this film is to see whom Seagal will impose physical punishment upon next. In every one of his films; this one is no exception, he happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. Therefore, giving him a chance to display his martial arts abilities.      There cannot be much said for this film except that it is a violent and surprisingly empty action flick. The first hour of this film introduces us to Seagal's character; Orin Boyd, a &#145;balls out' cop whom after saving the Vice President in a brash manner gets reassigned to a precinct rampant with corrupt cops. Seagal's character is no different from his other characters in which Boyd uses his actions rather than words to convey his opinions and engage in countless gunfights. And when he does use words, he uses his trademark &#145;I just woke up' coarse, raspy voice that makes one wonder if he can articulate at all. Rapper DMX plays Latrell Walker; a heroin smuggling crook who has greater plans on his mind. Seemingly enough, all this takes 60 minutes to develop meanwhile leaving the audience clueless as to who is the antagonist and protagonist.        Into the film's first three minutes we are exposed to an opening action sequence that displays Seagal's abilities and describes the tone of the film that director Andej Bartkowiak wants us to think. He makes it seems as if it is a simply empty, violent and formulaic action film. Yet, in watching the film a longer period of time one can see that this film does not take itself all that seriously.      The film at times, albeit through many misfired attempts, is quite &#145;tongue and cheek'. The director earns my respect in terms of his ability at making us know that the violence in this film is all too surreal. The action sequences are absurd and unrealistic, and Seagal is made out to be a modern day superhero. So much so that one of his rivals even goes so far as saying that he should wear a cape when making an entrance. If one were so inclined to ask where the proof is, witness Seagal's attendance in an anger management class alongside Tom Arnold. Arnold plays a Detroit Morning Show host who aids Seagal on his quest to save the city from this band of corrupt cops. Furthermore, the &#145;tongue in cheek' evidence can clearly be seem within the film's end credits as Arnold and Anthony Anderson engage it what had to be an improvised debate set against the backdrop of Arnold's fictional morning show on topics ranging from masturbation, sex and obese women.     The film tries to be something that it is not yet does neither fail nor succeed in accomplishing exactly what it wants to set out - which is still unknown. As aforementioned, the arduous plot development is unforgivable while the exciting final half-hour barely saves this film from being a complete waste of time.Giancarlo's Rating **    "},{"Title":"Seagal has gone past his prime","Date":"4 August 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Another &#145;original' storyline for Seagal.

These will be addressed in ascending order of importance. First, did anyone notice that there are only really three women featured prominently? The police commissioner, played by an underused Jill Hennessey, Trish, and one of the strippers at the night club. Of these three, Jill is the only woman who exhibits any strength of character, and is summarily killed off. Secondly, the ridiculous action sequence at the beginning. If he and the vice president were the only ones to survive, despite being thrown in the river, Segal should have gotten some kind of accommodation. The fact that the entire sequence is dismissed as some militia group, and never mentioned again, shows it to be a hollow action exercise, rather than any meaningful plot device. Lastly, the ridiculousness of the abduction sequence makes this a hard movie to watch. Segal's truck is forced into a stationary construction vehicle; men in black masks with automatic weapons jump out of the back of a black van and kidnap him. Then, they handcuff him, take off their masks (giving away their identities as corrupt cops), and proceed to tell him how they'll kill him exotically. Why not just shoot him in his car? For these three reasons, I found the movie difficult to watch, and even harder to enjoy, since these incongruities keep bothering me.

Now let's get this straight. It has been suggested that Mr. Seagal is lampooning his other performances. He is not. This is really the extent of his ability. This is the man whose stint hosting Saturday Night Live has been unfavorably compared to Nancy Kerrigan. Who else do we have in the movie? Michael Jai White, of Spawn fame (infamy), Tom Arnold, DMX, and that fat guy from Romeo Must Die (Anthony Anderson). Not exactly an acting Tour De Force here. The casting has more red flags than the Kremlin on May Day. We also get Andrzej Bartkowiak, the director from Romeo. Not only did he import the shaky camera work, bad angles, and excessive closeups to this movie, but he apparently also feels the need to put gratuitous closeups of naked strippers in every movie he directs.Before I go too far I'd like to say how much I respect Steven Seagal as a martial artist. He was the first foreigner to open a school in Japan (as an aside, he obviously must speak Japanese. Why not use that in one of his movies?) and he's very, very good. In the same way Jet Li is very, very good. And much like Jet Li's talent was obscured in Romeo, director Bartkowiak ruined the talent Seagal actually has by insisting on 1.) Overly cinematic Matrix-y martial arts, 2.) Too many closeups, 3.) And giving the cameraman two vodka martinis between takes. Back to music videos with you, Andrzej Bartkowiak! (The car chases were really nice though)I won't comment on the plot other than to say this. It seemed confusing and poorly edited, but we later realized that the theater was showing the reels out of order. After the movie was over, we told the manager, and he said that the movie must have been showing like that for three days, and we were the first to comment on it. Gives you an idea of what they were aiming for here. Okay, one more thing. A rifled bullet will go through a car door, but a shotgun blast will not penetrate a bulletproof vest.

Director Bartkowiak tries to liven things up a little by playing old tricks on the audience. For instance, the effectiveness of the plot-twists is based on making us like certain characters, who turn out to be on the bad-guys, and vice-versa. After a while that gets really tiresome. If you still find yourself surprised after a few of these 'twists', you might want to consider having your head examined. But as i indicated, the plot is not the most important part of a Seagal movie; it's the action. On that department Exit Wounds is pretty solid, albeit routine and unremarkable. Cracking limbs, whizzing bullets and lengthy car-chases; nothing you haven't seen yet. The really disappointing element here however is rapper DMX's acting-capabilities (or lack thereof). The man has a very limited range of expressions there's 'menacing', and then there's 'REALLY menacing'. Keep practicing, X. Also a little disconcerting were various scenes that were just completely ineffective; for instance there's DMX buying a car, the attempt to tie-in jokes with a black car-salesman-trying to-be-down falls flat. It's a shame Exit Wounds doesn't work on a comedy-level; that's the department this kind of movie can use to make up for lack of story, by writing tongue-in-cheek for instance.

Arnold and Anderson worked great together and separately as comic relief, and for those of you who think DMX's performance was wooden,or void of emotion, think about how depressed you would be if one of your family members was wrongly incarcerated. You would probably be seen as wooden or void of emotion as well. Everyone did a good job in the film, and when this comes out on video, I will rent it, much to my wife's chagrin. Finally, for the guy who used deus ex machina and denouement in his review of this film, the arthouse films are in the second theater on the left....

It's as good as the Glimmer Man, but not in the same league as Out for Justice, and far, far better than his recent lame offerings Fire Down Below and The Patriot.  It is incredibly violent.  As far as I know it was uncut in the UK, and looks it, there are a couple of extremely OTT deaths that would never have got passed James Ferman and one scene where Seagal starts punching people with a chain wrapped round his fist, and the most arm breaking since Out For Justice. Stylistically, it looks a lot like Romeo Must Die, (surprise, surprise) and Seagal looks completely out of place in some of the slow motion and Matrix type shots.  The plot makes very little sense and I felt there was a sense of deus ex machina in the d√©nouement.  The main set pieces, especially the opening action scene, are pretty exciting and well done, but unfortunately, Andrzej Bartkowiak seems to have learnt nothing from the criticisms made by the fight fans about Romeo Must Die; the fights are shot in extreme close up with far too much fast cutting, so you can't see clearly what is going on.  On the whole I came away satisfied; the pace is fast, the comic relief characters Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson weren't too irritating (I even laughed a couple of times), pretty good supporting cast including Isaiah Washington, DMX, and action stalwart Bill Duke and for anyone who wants to know what Michael Jai White has been up to recently, he seems to have spent most of his time in the gym.  Seagal fans will enjoy this, action fans will get something out of it, but martial arts fans will probably be as disappointed as they were after Romeo Must Die.

I have always enjoyed Seagal's earlier violent movies over his recent environment-loving preachy stuff (leave that to the National Geographic documentaries Steve). Mostly I loved it when he was either sending some colorfully dressed pimp through a windshield or completely breaking the whole elbow of a Jamaican drug dealer. It was the kind of disdain for procedure or unnecessary heroics/etiquette performed by most other generic action heroes that first interested me in his films. I was however a little dubious about his martial art noticing that his long frame and arms always seemed to assist him in twisting arms and slapping around only the standard bad guys but had never once seen it used against a larger opponent. Usually I find the action movies to be like arcade games where the lead badass is fought at the end (after defeating the minions and spending all my change), and more often than not is gigantic or has combat skills of his own the hero has to adapt to and best. So obviously my mouth was watering during Under Siege while anticipating the fight scene between Seagal and the massive leiutenant of Tommy Lee Jones character who ate his meat semi-raw, so imagine my disappointment when Seagal instead shoots him and uses his physical skills on only the usual thugs and bandsaw fodder. I have often remarked on this fact to a friend of mine who is a more devout Seagal fan than I, and I feel his worship is now validated by this recent movie Exit Wounds. The nightclub scene with the 2 giant bouncers who first resist his usual akido arm twist (due to enormous size and strength) and force Seagal adopt a different variety of actions (while still using their weight and strength against them) to defeat them was a much needed masterstroke (but a long time in coming). So I apologize for suggesting that Steven Seagal would never fight some massive weightlifter type guy in any of his movies to avoid my perceived shortcomings of akido with that kind of opponent. I can only hope Exit Wounds will mark a phoenix like return of Seagal to violent action movies, but hopefully with less ridiculous comedy relief, product placement and that retarded unrealistic music-video fashion clothing sense more at home in Jennifer Lopez video clips than real life street wear that is constantly insinuating itself into more and more movies. While Romeo Must Die had too much of that style over substance and tried too hard to cover all the bases with humour, love story, organised crime and action but coming short in all of them (not to mention mocking Jet Li's martial arts abilities with that foul CGI stuff), Exit Wounds sticks more to the action and is honest about what the film is meant to be.

"},{"Title":"Good action, bad writing.","Date":"14 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  The latest film from action has-been Steven Segal is a mixed bag of both cool stunts and a truly tired story.  As usual, the title of this movie has nothing to do with anything actually in the movie.  Segal plays the typical action movie hero who's rough around the edges, hated by his superiors, but always gets the job done.  Segal's character lacks the coolness of Bullitt, or the eye for justice of Dirty Harry.  Segal just wants to do his job the best he knows how.  After saving the life of the Vice President of the U.S. against orders (falling back on the old cliche of how dumb police superiors can be), he's shipped off to the worst post in town.  The writers of the film must have thought they were being innovative when they cast the station commander as a 30 year-old, attractive woman, rather than the typical police captain stereotype (this stereotype is reserved for another character).  This is the most innovative the movie ever gets.  With his new partner, Segal stumbles across a plot orchestrated by none other than DMX.  DMX's casting is obviously intended to draw in a younger audience to this movie.  The rap stars acting never rises above a few scornful looks and some tough guy talk, but DMX adequately fills the role.  Unfortunately, DMX's character (who might actually be the most interesting character in the film) is never really explored.  However, lots of screen time is given to professional sidekicks Anthony Anderson and Tom Arnold. Exit Wounds is littered with both lame jokes and unrealistic action.  There are some truly awesome looking car crashes in this movie, and some stunt work.  As if to punctuate the unrealism of the movie, Segal is at one point forced to fight a street gang trying to steal his new truck.  The street gang is made up of guys who know martial arts (or else how could Segal fight them without it just looking silly?) and this is the only street gang in the world that has each major ethnic group represented equally in its ranks.  The plot manages to be both predictable and unbelievable at the same time.  Nothing is this movie happens for any reason except to lead to a cool stunt sequence.  The surprises and plot twists are piled on for the sake of intentional shock value, rather than to serve the story. The stunts go from breath-taking (the car chases are really good) to unbelievable (Segal's feats of superhuman agility belong more in movies like Crouching Tiger or The Matrix where people are SUPPOSED to have special abilities).  Not to be undone, DMX does something towards the end of the movie with a shotgun that is simply impossible.There's really nothing wrong with Exit Wounds once you realize that this movie is just an excuse for lots of action.  It's nothing more than a macho fantasy of guns, martial arts, and car chases.  If that's what you want to see, then the dumb story won't bother you.  If you see it, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.

We are to believe that he is a professional drug dealer and has a company on the internet that earns him lots of money. Latrell Walker as we know him as for the most part of the movie is a dynamic character. Although we are led to believe that he is a criminal he is really working on a project to uncover the bad cops in LA. His motives are clear and we understand why he is doing what he is doing as the movie comes close to an end. His character is a round character, one with complex and is many-sided. This is shown to be true by his two names, and the different lives that he leads. It is somewhat difficult to understand all the motives of Latrell Walker, but in the end it all makes sense.

This time, however, thanks to some dynamite, truly exciting actions sequences and a much more playful, less serious and stoic performance, Segal has come up with an action film that makes up for the bevy of stinkers he's made.Exit Wounds brings back the whispering Segal as a cop who's demoted from big city police work to urban peacemaker after a botched-up attempt on the Vice Preisdent's life.  There, he discovers a ring of corrupt cops involved in a bevy of shady dealings with a reputed drug lord, played by DMX.The cast has fun with the material, and it's actually very entertaining to see Segal actually make light of his own tough guy persona, as when his character is required to take anger management classes - self-mocking humor is always a plus in any movie in showing it is not supposed to be taken seriously.  DMX's performance really showcases no acting prowess for the rap star, as his role is underwritten and he does nothing more than look rough and cute (this was probably a smart move on the screenwriter's part, since his line delivery at times borders near B-movie grade.)Action  is by far the most frequent genre in which story takes a backseat to action sequences, and sometimes, it works, as it does here.  The action sequences are also well-orchestrated and sometimes over-the-top, but the opening scene is so well executed with a storm of bullets flying and tearing through cars that  it matches Michael Mann's bank shootout in Heat in ferocity.  The screenplay may sometimes step in a quagmire of cliche, but at other times actually breaks them, especially the standard love-interest cliche.  Here, that device is curtailed quite violently and effectively.  The ending also is a nice twist that the audience probably won't see coming.Exit Wounds is not only Segal's best action film to date, it's also a grand collection of exciting shootouts, breathtaking stunts, and very entertaining if somewhat lacking in character development and originality. Still, it's a much more vibrant work of chaotic action than some of the lifeless junk produced by so called action mavens like John Explosions and Doves Woo.7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Not as bad as the last few","Date":"2 April 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  Dumb, unbelievable action film, but jeeze, it's Seagal.

Steven Seagal is still the king of bad action movies and will have to do more than cut his ponytail off in order to change that. He still has this image of a stiff and boorish bully who always talks as if he were trying to repress an uncontrollable rage.He is no fun as an action hero, and as a person, there is very little to like about many of his characters. He stars here as a renegade Detroit police detective named Orin Boyd. After he pulls a stunt that saves the Mayor's life from would-be attackers, Boyd receives more negative feed back than good. He is considered to be reckless by his department, and so without telling us why the Mayor was attacked in the first place, the story switches over to Boyd's new headquarters.He is demoted down to the 15th precinct, a hole in the ground that he doesn't want to be in. He is assigned a new partner (Isaiah Washington) and is told to seek group therapy for his violent and reckless behavior. The rest of the plot centers on a drug scam run by Latrell Walker (DMX), a crime boss who soon becomes Boyd's prime target. But what Boyd doesn't know is that it runs deeper than drugs.Exit Wounds is a messy all over the place. It contains brutal martial arts sequences, gruesome death, formulaic story, and it's biggest problem, just bad acting. It is directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak, the guy who made even Jet Li look bad last year in Romeo Must Die. Here, he is working with the same tools he did last time. The fight scenes are all poorly edited and over stylized with slow motion kicks and punches. He subjects his characters to gruesome deaths (one in particular goes through a windshield while in another scene one is crushed between two cars.), which just come off as mindless violence rather than anything impressive to watch.The plot is the regular renegade cop routine, including several old cliches that you would find in your regular silly cop thriller. But this thing really loses its way when it gets trigger happy with its plot twists. Characters switch sides throughout this entire movie until it gets to the point where the twists are the movie. You begin to lose track of who is good and bad, and overall, you just don't care. Nothing that writers Ed Horowitz and Richard O'Ovidio come up with is ever shocking and it is easy to just slump back in your chair and roll your eyes everytime another twist is introduced.Acting, by Bartkowiak's definition, must be to have his actors model for the camera while rap music plays in the background. The script is already spitting out senseless dialogue as it is, but the actors bring no emotion to their roles besides tough demeanors and blank expressions. Seagal is terrible at doing comedy, in fact, he actually looks more threatening when doing so. DMX has that same ability, just with drama. There is an early scene where he visits his jailed brother, a serious scene that is written and acted terribly enough to be laughable.One highlight of Exit Wounds though is Anthony Anderson. This guy is like a fatter Chris Tucker. He always makes even the worst line funny because of his great timing with physical mannerisms. He and Tom Arnold apparently knew this movie was terrible and so they come through with a very funny improv conversation (Arnold plays a talk show host in the movie) that is worth the wait. They take a crack at everything from viagra to masturbation to fat women. It's more entertaining than anything else in this movie, trust me.

No, you are not going to develop the theory behind the meaning of life from watching this movie, nor is it a traditional Seagal movie where he gets mad and takes everyone out. This movie is a good combination of humor (Tom Arnold), action (Seagal) and drama (DMX).This is a great improvement over Seagal's last string of films however the plot is a little weak and I am a true believer that movies can have both action and a plausible plot.

It won't be best movie of the year, but it works as an action flick (though a little too much action and gore for my taste). It's best to break the movie down to its components.Story Hey, it's an action flick. Don't expect too much and you'll get more than you expect. Most foreshadowing is telegraphed so bad it's like flashing a neon sign, but some things were surprising.Action Too much isn't always a good thing and after a while, I just started getting bored with it. Perhaps a person more geared to action movies will enjoy it, I didn't.Segal Probably in his best role since Executive Decision(?). He actually gets hit a few times here, not like in his other movies where's he's not touched at all. I'm impressed, he actually learns that it's okay to laugh at himself. The scene where he's a traffic cop is hilarious. Best of all, no running scenes (far as I can remember). We all know how Steven Segal runs.DMX nothing good, nothing bad. Lots of posing and strut walking. DMX needs to deflate the ego a bit. Strangely, his overinflated opinion of himself was worse than Segal's in this movie.Supporting actors Tom Arnold (a sorta revival of his role in True Lies) and the fat, black guy (forgot his name, but sorta revived his role in Romeo Must Die) are *very* funny and *extremely* funny together at the end. These two should do more movies as sidekicks; they both have a talent. Ever since True Lies, I've wondered why they haven't used Tom Arnold in more roles like that. (By the way, the allusions to Tom's wife are wicked funny).Fight scenes Pretty good, though a bit over the top. Why this 360-flip move is popular, I'll never understand. It was stupid in Mission Impossible 2 (which was a stupid, stupid movie), and it was stupid here.All in all Don't go expecting to see a movie like The Seventh Seal or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. This movie is formula-action, but with enough to raise it a level above the other formula-action movies. 7/10, and perhaps 8/10 w.r.t. other action flicks.Note Don't leave when the credits start to roll. You'll miss, IMO, the best part of the movie.

This will definitely bring Steven Seagal back from his string of poor movies.The directing in this movie was much better, with the way the scenes were played out.

In one of the comments, I read, someone said that they could not see Steven Seagal as much of a gun person.

I found the plot somewhat questionable, but who cares?  It's action, baby! The supporting characters were good, with a big nod given to Anthony Anderson for his comedic backup.  He was good in Romeo Must Die, but significantly better here.One of the best points about the film was Seagal's willingness to get kicked around for a change.  Usually, he's the opposite of Jackie Chan, escaping battles with multiple opponents totally unscathed.  This time, his character faced adversaries who landed repeatedly on him, and lasted more than one exchange before succumbing to this throw or that joint lock.  Actually having DMX's character hold his own a little against Boyd was, I thought, a very interesting choice, and one I don't disapprove of.I have only two gripes about this film.  First, Jill Hennessy was grossly misused here.  She could have made an excellent contribution to the movie had her part been more substantial.  Also, Mulcahy's death was a little too similar to that of Hennessy's character in Law and Order, but I suppose that's part of the role rather than anything specific to the actress.  The suddenness of her end was actually a refreshing change from the norm.My other complaint was, as another person mentioned, the shortness of the fight scene involving Michael Jai White.  White did very good scenes with Jean Claude Van Damme in Universal Soldier 2, and could have performed spectacularly with Seagal if given the chance.  Unfortunately, this was the only opportunity we had to see Michael in action, which is a pity.Other than some typical action film implausibilities in the shoot outs, etc., and the use of the wires in some of the scenes, which I find greatly overdone since the Matrix brought it to the mainstream, Exit Wounds was well done.  If you like action, this one shouldn't disappoint you. "},{"Title":"You're right.

We are asked to believe that DMX (notsure; think he's a rapper) is not, as he seems in the first fewminutes to be, a thug, but instead is an Internet millionaire andanti-police-brutality activist. (In a recent, other Steven Seagalmovie, we are meant to believe that the great man is a NativeAmerican-simpatico ecologist.) Bartkowiak is smart he doesn't tryto be John Woo, like most other contemporary action directors--hetries to be Ringo Lam. And succeeds.Too bad the script--a sort of hiphop-flavored riff on MAGNUMFORCE--is so sucky. The movie has a groovy  rap-and-house-music soundtrack that amplifies the adrenaline ofevery scene it's in, and Bartkowiak stages some neat, kinetic,grunt-inducing action set pieces. And the thing moves along at adecent clip. (The producer, Joel Silver, seems to be still followinghis eighties whammy chart.)

I have no problems having action substituted for plot, and therefore enjoy a lot of movies that most people think are absolute crap, but this movie doesn't fall in that category.(Some plot spoilers below, do not read if you haven't seen it)The short of it is that Seagal is a cop (detective of some sort, although we never really find out his rank, it seems he's a cop that works the streets but can do whatever the hell he wants, yeah right).  In the opening scene he saves the vice president by noticing that something with the police escort was out of place.  The scene kind of reminded me of the post-bank-robbery scene in Heat, although less realistic in this movie.  The fact that his handgun turned into a machine pistol did kind of bother me, but that's nothing unusual for this type of movie.  Anyway, after saving the VP, he's demoted because he didn't follow orders.He stumbles into a batch of bad cops at his new assignment and has a chance to redeem himself by busting up a crime ring inside the police department. The plot was actually more developed than I expected, and they pretty much didn't take any hard rights through the whole movie, which at least made it a little more believable than some other movies which omit an important detail just to leave the audience guessing.Then there's the action.  What can I say?  This entire movie is an action sequence.  I don't think I've seen as much non-stop action as this film has in a long time.

I'm glad to see that Seagal realized (or at least his agent did) that his name is no longer sufficient to carry a movie alone.  Adding DMX was really a smart move.  For a rap singer, he certainly did a credible job.  He looks the part as well, and I really enjoyed the fight scenes between he and Seagal.  This movie is really a throw back to Seagal's earlier movies; the simple,entertaining action films without the nonsensical political undertones thrown in.  Seagal's political stance, while admirable, nearly cost him his career from what I've seen.  I'm really glad to see him get back to the basics that made him a star in the early 1990's.  As Seagal films go, this is certainly one of the better ones, and if you like action movies, you can't go wrong by seeing it.  It has some hilariously funny parts as well, something most Seagal movies have always lacked.  Anthony Anderson's TK character is an absolute riot.

Seagal is leaner and has fun with his movie persona-- particularly with the story line having his character Orin Boyd attending an anger management class. There is a lot of action in the movie which keeps it going. The martial art/ Aikido is particularly well done in the carjacking sequence. Seagal really demonstrates his Aikido Shihan mastery in that one. The other more Matrix-like fight scenes are good, though it's becoming common place in today's action movies. It's also interesting that Seagal was not fight choreographer for this outing. DMX as a martial artist is a stretch. However, as an actor in the role of Latrell Walker, he is very charismatic. If he can stay out of jail, he'll have a career in the movies. It's unfortunate that Michael Jai White was not able to display his martial arts mastery-- Jai White is a world class martial artist.

In fact both of them have a straight-forward delivery that done any other way with that script would have been disastrous.The situation Orin Boyd (Segal) finds himself in is straight out of cop-action-flick textbooks, complete with a couple of flustered and loud higher-ups.  Orin of course is brash and uncontrollable...But I won't ramble. Suffice to say, we've seen it before. But they don't dwell on it (thank god).The action itself is fine. There is plenty we've seen and a few kind of new nifty things.  Michael Jai White flexes a bit, and Tom Arnold is funny. Don't go seeing this movie for anything other than what it is; and what it is is a solid action movie.

More likely, he needed the cash and the sheep audience will go to this in droves (desiring flailing limbs over substance). Surely the name DMX, sweeping households across the nation, isn't the attraction. There's nothing new here but if the past, vast library of Seagal epics is your cup of tea- then drink this up. (Hey!

The former boasted an in-depth story line, strong characters (females no less), stunning cinematography, and amazing fight sequences, while the other was intentionally comedic and turned out to be a blockbuster. Could this trend lead to respectability with the studios and the film going public?  Well, let's not get carried away.Orin Boyd (Seagal) is part Dirty Harry, part Serpico - a rogue cop with a bad attitude, he takes his oath to serve and protect, seriously, thinks nothing of bending the rules and particularly despises dirty cops.  After one too many gut reactions Orin gets reassigned to the worst precinct in the city and soon discovers that a major drug dealer is working with several of the city's finest.  The question becomes who is the real crook?Steven Seagal is an acknowledged Aikido expert, who also happens to be arrogant, temperamental, a bad actor and known for taking himself far too seriously.  While his earlier films were not what anyone would consider cinematic watersheds, they did have excellent action sequences.  His most recent works have been, to be charitable, forgettable at best.  Maybe that explains the new Seagal.Exit Wounds has a bonafide plot, several of the characters think before they strike, the fight sequences are stylishly choreographed, the pulse quickening action sequences are tightly edited and there is an overall unique sense of humor.  Seagal has even learned to poke fun at himself, and his character's bad attitude is the focus of a running gag.  DMX, meanwhile, is more than adequate, as an actor, but I wouldn't suggest he abandon his music career anytime soon.   Both actors however are overshadowed by the duo of Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson who provide constant comic relief throughout the film, especially during the credits.While there are several particularly ridiculous moments, Seagal's pistol transforming into a machine gun comes to mind, and enough beefcake to supply Black Angus for a month, action movie fans will be able to overlook them.

Unlike Kurt Russell or Sylvester Stallone, however, Seagal is utterly unable to act without some kind of weapon in hand or combat situation to go through. In such cases, there are several things a good director will do in order to even out the actor's inability to act. When Schwarzenegger tried to act in Twins, they fixed the problem by having a competent comic actor feed him material to play off in his own limited way.In Exit Wounds, the idea is to have Seagal share the spotlight with one actor who makes him look good through sheer incompetence, namely DMX (gee, and they wonder why Afro-Americans are seen as idiots with no linguistic skills). The other actor, presumably the comic foil in the deal, is none other than Tom Arnold. Tom never quite makes us sure whether he's trying to reflect comic material off of Seagal, a thankless task in itself, or trying to make Seagal look like an actor through sheer incompetence. Given the screen writing and theme of the film, either one seems likely.The plot, such as it is, involves corrupt policemen laundering money through the internet, or something to that effect. Between all the idiotic sequences involving stupid actions to show what sort of beat Seagal's character is working, Seagal tries to act out dialogue with a police captain portrayed by Jill Hennessy. If the idea was to make Seagal look good through the incompetence of his co-stars, then one has to wonder whose brilliant idea it was to cast the best secondary star that Law & Order has had to date.To give Exit Wounds its due credit, it has genuinely funny moments in spite of the constant attacks of ebonics. When we finally get to see the mock Tom Arnold Show, it makes the other ninety-odd minutes of wasted opportunities genuinely worthwhile. There is one incredibly stupid moment when policemen are tazering each other for sport, but you have to expect that kind of idiocy from a Seagal film. This is indeed a stupid action flick in a market that has not recovered from being saturated with them.In the end, I gave Exit Wounds a one out of ten. Like Dark Angel or Boyz N The Hood (great English, by the way), Exit Wounds proves the old the cooler you claim you are, the cooler you ain't rule. Let it be known henceforth - Exit Wounds is the film that made Tom Arnold look like a good actor.

Aside from that film, everything he's churned has been generic crap, and they're terrible movies almost always because of him.Hmm, let's see the pattern in Seagal movies.  Kill all opponents without one laying a hand on him (usually by grabbing their arms and flipping them to the floor), have said opponents approach him when they could just as easily shoot him from a distance, and once in a while deliver a message about humanity's lack of care to the environment.  To be fair, Exit Wounds attempts to fix all these problems.  Seagal does fight a few difficult opponents and there is no preaching here.  But now there's a new problem, Seagal is hilariously unconvincing because he's a chubby, 50-year old action star.Seagal is Orin Boyd, an edgy cop who's been assigned to the worst precinct in the city (what city it is, I don't remember) after saving the life of the vice president.  Apparently, the top cops think that act of heroism was actually more along the lines the mark of a loose cannon.  Anyway, he eventually teams up with a criminal (DMX) to stop a gang of crooked cops (led by Michael Jai White).  Much gunplay and martial arts action ensue.Exit Wounds is directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak, who also directed Romeo Must Die, Jet Li's debut lead in an American film.  He crafts Exit Wounds in the same style and manner, which means it's basically the same movie (plot is negligible in these films) with Jet Li replaced by Steven Seagal. Automatically, that's a colossal step backward, going from the ultimate badass wushu champion to washed-up, overweight, and expressionless Seagal.True, the fight scenes here aren't as digitally manipulated to the same extents as Romeo, but watching Seagal leap over a moving car, dodge a bullet and kick his opponent with one hand on the ground and prop himself back up without a hitch is probably even more laughable, entirely because of how out-of-shape this guy is starting to look.  To be fair to the man, his lack of acting ability makes his one-liners more effective, if only because of how utterly deadpan his delivery is.Exit Wounds is partially a buddy flick, so the other half of the duo is DMX, who's been in all of Bartkowiak's films to date, and has yet to show the slightest bit of convincing acting.  I just harped on Seagal for that, but DMX is twice as bad.  Every time he enunciates dialogue, it's almost cringe-inducing.  For comic relief, there's Tom Arnold and Anthony Anderson, who are actually pretty funny together, though not nearly as much when each is solo.  As the needed babe of the piece, because hey, you attract guys with guns, fights, explosions, and chicks, there's Jill Hennessy, who really gets nothing to do except drive during a car chase.Bartkowiak handles some of the action scenes with a deft hand, particularly the opening shootout, but once again, when Seagal's called on to move gracefully, all signs of thrills and excitement are tossed out the window and replaced by unitentional hilarity.  So far, I haven't done much to criticize the plot so I haven't picked on the cliches and contrivances. No matter, though, the plot didn't bug me so much as the fact that I was bored for 90% of Exit Wounds' running time.  That's why this is a bad movie.

Occasionally some of the wire work is badly done and the actors don't really look like they are moving gracefully &#150; more that they are being pulled around by an unseen force!  The film managed to not give Seagal too much to do and thus it never really had him looking silly.  The actual fight of the film (Jai White and Seagal) is not dazzling but is impressive as White shows a great deal more agility than Seagal.  DMX's skills are a little lacking and (as in C2TG) he doesn't fit the martial arts style of fighting &#150; the scene where he faces up to Seagal exposes just how short and skinny a man he is!Another reviewer said he would like to see comedy in this film because he thought it would have been better.  I think he missed the point &#150; there was lots of comedy in this film &#150; just none of it was actually funny.  Anderson does his usual comedy sidekick routine but is woeful as always.

Overall, I still enjoyed the film as the action was actually pretty good for a Seagal flick.  A word of caution would be that I was in a very forgiving mood when I watched this film and even then I still accept that it is average at best.

While there he sees that he's landed himself a reputation. While going about his job he starts noticing things that do not add up. A few of the cops there are dirty, they steal and sell heroin recovered from the police dept. This movie is a Steven Segal Movie.... Along with DMX, Anthony Anderson, Tom Arnold and Eva Mendes. This movie is action packed as well as some comedy thrown in the mix. Other reviews state the plot makes no sense? Whats not to get? The movie wasn't designed to win an Oscar or a Golden Globe. This movie promises everything a Steven Segal movie would. Steven Segal kicks butt and saves the day. I am a guy who is a Segal fan and I've seen this movie a hand full of times. The movie is entertaining, regardless of how Unbelievable it is. Steven Segal is a Martial Arts Expert and just because a guy is twice his size means nothing.

It all went wrong with this movie...he injected (some might say, not me!) a preachy overtone concerning the enviroment.

EXIT WOUNDS made a lot of money, worldwide, and was #1 in the US box office for a while. The movie itself, is typical SEAGAL/cop fodder with flashier fight scenes (i don't like to see SEAGAL using wires, though!) and a realiance on an urban hip hop edge (via, co-star DMX) SEAGAL looks older, but still up to the challenge, and his wit is getting drier with each movie (it is rumoured he was FORCED to lose weight for this role!)

But I did get them. Seagal's no nonsense Aikido fighting was refreshing compared to the stylized phony baloney of the likes of Jean Claude Van Damme, or the jokes and one-liners of Arnold.Seagal's last several films were disappointments, including Fire Down Below; one of them, The Patriot, was released directly to video and never made it to theaters. The energy and fun were gone, and Seagal was looking a tad heavy to be taking on a swarm of vicious hoodlums as he did on the battleship or against a Jamaican drug possee. At least he took a decent stand for the environment, however ridiculous he came across as looking.But now Seagal has hit a new low. In a sleazy and cheap attempt to pander to an urban audience (read black), he has allied himself with a Rap music performer, DMX, and started ragging on the police. That should go over big in the Inner City where vitriolic cop-hating is so common. Yes blame the police - not missing black fathers or black drug-dealers. Maybe Al Sharpton consulted on the script, or some other demagogue and race-baiter. Oh yes, DMX can act no better than Seagal, and that's pretty bad.So we have after all is said and done a mundane and instantly forgettable action film which we've all seen before in the past - and seen done much better. Even the martial arts segments were nothing much. But it is better than Seagal's last few offerings which he walked through.Seagal teamed up with a black partner before, and not just in Marked for Death. It was in Glimmer Man, and as mediocre as that was I liked it better than this.By the way, look for skinny Jill Hennessy as a cop.

Exit wounds  is a lame action movie that has nothing to offer.Story ? Predictable and was done before with much better results . Anthony Anderson ? Just as unfunny as always. Seagal and DMX ? Both can't act and have a charisma of death cat. Action scenes ? From fight scenes that look incredibly silly to shootouts and car chases that you can barely see what's going on. Interesting characters ? Oh , please. Humor ? A visit to dentist is much funnier.There is one good idea here involving belt and shotgun . A rare example of something truly intelligent and good in this movie. Everything else screams made for MTV generation . Maybe that was the point . They wanted to sell Seagal to younger generation of viewers . Maybe. It's not the worst movie of Seagal , but still not really worth watching . Bartkowiak's (the director) style is no style at all . He has proved it with his other movies (Doom , Romeo must die). I don't see any effort here at all. It's as unambitious run by the numbers action movie as you can imagine. I give it 1/10. Watch out for Bill Duke (Predator) as Chief Hinges and Eva Mendes(Training day) as Trish.

I personally have every movie ( DVD ) mentioned as well as the ones with the Rappers and Kick ***ers play in, as mentioned above... It's kind of cool when Big Stars and Producers bring the Gang together for a Movie ! Two Thumbs up for both Movie's and Crew's !

One of my fav action films of modern time. DMX out plays and out acts Seagul in my opinion. Which is rare to see from rappers who turn their hand to acting.Don't get me wrong though, Seagul does deliver. Seeing as though the other reviews have pretty much got everything covered about this hit film, i won't go on too much! Some excellent music (if your into the rap/hiphop scene) inc the main soundtrack by DMX himself (An interesting cover with a rap angle on it of Bill Withers/Al ????'s 'Ain't no sunshine') Which i think is a really good version (and i do love the original as well) The rest of the cast have been cast carefully and all actors are perfect for their respective rolls. The acting is above-average (Seagul mainly concentrates on his fighting technique as usual, however DMX is fantastic. Really good story line of corruption within the police force. Good Cops,bad cops sort of thing. Highly entertaining from the word go-right to the final scene. With a fantastic music score,flashy cars,fantastic fight scenes(both from kung fu master 'Seagul' and rapper 'DMX')to its pretty good storyline.I'd give this film 8 and a half out of 10.If you haven't seen this film yet-I'd highly recommend you watching it on DVD as the extras (Deleted scenes,making of,behind the scenes and music video) are also all highly entertaining. Best viewed and heard through a 5.1 surround sound set up, as it enhances the film and its action further through its quality sound! I'm sure one of the other reviewers have told you about the story line so this is just about my personal thoughts on this highly entertaining film! Definitely Recommended. (Also- Training Day and SWAT as part of the cop/action collection) ******** "}]
