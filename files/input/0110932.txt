Robert Redford does a fantastic job of recreating the atmosphere in perfect detail, as well as the fascinating story of the '50s version of reality TV, the quiz shows, going awry.Paul Scofield is absolutely mind-boggling as Van Doren Sr., and Ralph Fiennes is wonderful, handsome, and charismatic as Charles Van Doren. The rest of the cast is marvelous - John Turturro, David Paymer, Hank Azaria, and Rob Morrow.Van Doren was a dream contestant - good-looking, educated, with a beautiful speaking voice - and captivated the country with his intelligence. Unfortunately, it wasn't reality at all, just fantasy. But, as Van Doren says while verbally sparring with his dad, It was mine own. It sure was, and he went into oblivion because of it.

If you were a contestant on a TV game show and the producers offered you a load of money to do a fixed show where you're given the answers in advance, would you do it? Or would you turn your back on the producers and walk away? In this film, Charles Van Doren does not walk away, but he does hesitate. As played by Ralph Fiennes, he's a bright, likable fellow who seems like a good man despite his willing participation in a fraud.The film is smartly written, tightly plotted, and populated by interesting characters. It is also entertaining. It unfolds like a great detective story, except that no murder has taken place. There isn't even any crime. As shocking as it may seem, there were no laws against rigging a quiz show back in the 1950s, because no lawmaker had considered that such a thing would ever happen. When the scandal came to light, those working behind the scenes who engineered the fraud managed to survive with their careers intact, and the people who suffered the harshest consequences were the contestants, who were simply pawns. That says something about the distortions of television culture, but this theme, among others, is nicely understated in the film.Director Robert Redford has a gift for finding the drama in seemingly mundane topics, but not in a contrived or manipulative fashion. The '50s quiz show scandal is the sort of topic that could easily have made for a preachy and artificial TV movie. It's a great credit to Redford's film that it doesn't contain any long moralizing speeches. Though the movie has many great quotes, the characters talk like real people, and the situations grow out of their personalities. We end up rooting for several characters at once. We want Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the lawyer sent to investigate the show, to succeed in uncovering the scandal. But we also feel for Van Doren, who almost comes off as a tragic hero. We even feel a little for the pathetic and unlikable Herb Stemple (John Turturro), the whistle-blower who's been bamboozled and humiliated by the producers.The movie works on the most basic level as simple drama, the high points being those scenes where Goodwin uncovers each new layer to the case. The first time I saw the film, I was put in mind of a detective story like Colombo. There's no mystery, of course, since we know from the start who the perpetrators are, what they did and how they did it. But the labyrinth of corruption that Goodwin must probe is fascinating to behold.Goodwin naively assumes he's practically taking down the network (the movie hints that the scandal goes to the very top) even though no laws were broken. The situation has the feel of a conspiracy, the people talking in euphemisms like they were mob bosses or something (For seventy grand you can afford to be humiliated). The contestants themselves are no dummies they are smart, knowledgeable people who could very well have been used honestly on a trivia show. The producers simply wanted to control the responses to make the show more dramatic. What made this unethical was the amount of deception it required. It's one thing to have entertainment that everyone knows is fake (e.g., pro-wrestling), it's quite another to pass off something phony as something real. Of course now I'm getting preachy, something I praised the movie for not doing. But that's exactly my point. In a lesser movie, there would have been characters explaining the distinction. Here, it's left to us to assess the situation. That's the best kind of movie, the kind that invites further discussion.Above all, the movie is about integrity and what defines it. Goodwin (in a classic reversal of our culture's typical view of lawyers) is the boy scout in the story, who says at one point that he would never have participated in the fraud if he were in Van Doren's shoes, and we believe him. But a large part of the film involves his relationship with Van Doren, a man he likes and doesn't want to hurt. His desire to protect Van Doren (but not Stemple) from ruin while bringing down the true perpetrators of the scandal leads to one of the movie's most memorable lines, when Goodwin's wife calls Goodwin the Uncle Tom of the Jews, because he's sticking up for a corrupt Gentile. We respect Goodwin and admire his reluctance to hurt Van Doren, but we, too, wonder whether he's handling the case with the proper objectivity.The movie has some interesting subtexts dealing with the anti-Semitism coming from Jewish producers themselves. In one scene, producers Dan Enright and Albert Freedman basically explain to Van Doren, in so many words, that Stemple is too Jewish for the show. This is a phenomenon I've rarely seen dealt with in the movies, possibly because there aren't too many films depicting the history of television.The film is often criticized for departing significantly from the facts of the case. For example, the real Goodwin actually played a minimal role in exposing the scandal. I can understand why those involved in the case may have resented these inaccuracies. But filmmakers do have dramatic license. Probably this film should have changed the names of the characters from their real-life counterparts, to reinforce the fact that it's not an exact account of what happened. The purpose of movies isn't to duplicate real life, but to reflect on real life, to gain fresh insight, and Quiz Show achieves that purpose with dignity and style.

He was handsome, articulate, witty, and all the girls thought him incredibly attractive (although their pre-teen minds did not yet understand sexuality).  Growing up in a Jewish neighborhood as I did, Herb Stempel did not come off so nerdy as he looks now in retrospect.  When it came out that everyone had cheated, us kids felt not only betrayed, but sleazily cheated personally.  The girls felt somehow violated!Here Redford turns in an understated masterpiece.  He sets the stage and the standard, and gets fantastic performances from his actorsJohn Turturro as Stempel is excellent, but a fine job by Johann Carlo as his principled wife, which may be overlooked in such company, is the rock upon which his family can really rely.Ralph Fiennes, as the hapless Charles Van Doren, manages to get across his character's dilemma a mere achiever in a family of ultra-achievers.  In any other family he'd have been prime, as a Van Doren he would always be an also-ran.  Many have pointed out the great job of Paul Scofield as Mark Van Doren, Charles' father.  He is the epitome of the WASP-intellectual padrone.  And he has our sympathy when his son so sorely disappoints him and disgraces the family.David Paymer is excellent and believable as Enright, the unsavory producer.  He makes it almost seem disloyal not to cheat!Bit parts are all little plums Martin Scorsese as Martin Rittenhouse, the Geritol exec, smugly contemptuous of the public and the government.  George Martin as the network president, clearly Jewish, and just as clearly a Teflon Don in his own world.The scenes at the Van Doren estate are designed to convey investigator Goodwin's (Rob Morrow) culture shock and outsider status, and they represent the academic WASP world of the time accurately and wonderfully.All in all, a great movie.

It can get away with not preaching because the consequences of their actions didn't harm anyone. It doesn't say, 'if you do something wrong you will be punished'. It says 'If you do something wrong, can you live with yourself'. It's the getting away with it I couldn't stand Charlie says at one point.A classical tragedy of a man with the world at his fingertips who throws it all away at his own volition. As a classical Shakespearean actor Fiennes is perfect for the role.A wonderful intelligent and literate script, the pieces between Charlie and his father in the Athanaeum and at the picnic are wonderful.Subtle music and stylish presentation are the icing on the cake.

There are no moral dilemmas whatever.  And a good thing too - thorny ethical issues would only turn it into an episode of `Star Trek'.  If you think a film needs to be confused about right and wrong in order to be interesting, watch `Quiz Show' and realise your error.Here's most of the ethics in a nutshell the star contestants of a popular quiz show are cheating, with the connivance of the producers, the sponsor, and the network.  That they shouldn't be cheating is never in dispute.  The interesting questions are  Why are they cheating?  and, What is it like for them, and how do they maintain dignity, when they're found out?  Of course, in an intelligent character study like this there are plenty of other questions.  I won't ruin your pleasure by giving away any of the answers.  The best scenes, probably, are the ones in which a character must admit to someone or some group of people that he has cheated.  All these scenes are very good and each is handled in a different way.  But they're just cherries in a rich fruitcake.  `Quiz Show' is one of my personal favourites.  It was nominated for Best Picture of 1994 - an unusually fertile year - although the award went instead to some big dumb propaganda piece.

The principal actors give phenomenal performances  Fiennes' Van Doren is usually unflappable and cold, but manages to allow vulnerability to surface at times, and Turturro's Stempel is a study in almost sociopathic and manic behavior.  What allows both actors to transcend mere greatness is their ability to make the viewer both admire and detest their characters with something as subtle as a glance or body language.  Morrow's character of the `whistle-blower' is there as the moral fiber; the outsider who looks upon the situation both with objectivity and as the devil's advocate. Redford's direction is rich and well-paced.  There were not any slow moments in the film, and he did not have to adhere to rapid-fire editing to achieve the momentum of the film.  Perhaps the subject matter is a factor, but I have found that with the exception of `Ordinary People', the films I have seen under Redford's direction have been good in a technical respect but lean toward the maudlin.  With Quiz Show, he does what should be done when telling a true story &#150; he does not resort to preaching, rather he directs with an objectivity that allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions.  Quiz Show is an excellent film that I highly recommend, especially to see the razor-sharp performances of Fiennes and Turturro. --Shelly  "},{"Title":"What can I say?

When I saw the rating I was very impressed, not to mention how this was nominated for best picture of '94, considering it was up against Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and Shawshank Redemption, it didn't really stand a chance. But I rented this movie and I'm convinced that 1994 had to be one of the best years for films. Quiz Show is an incredibly impressive film by Robert Redford, which I didn't even realize that this guy could direct! The story is just a perfect one for any type of a debate conversation on what is right and what is wrong.21 is a popular TV quiz show in the 50's where they ask very hard questions and the guests win lots of money, Herb Stempel has been the reigning champion for weeks. But he's not exactly what you would call the TV hunk, he's got the radio face. Charles Van Doren is a huge fan of quiz shows, so he auditions, and when the executives see him, they go crazy over him, he's handsome, he's smart, he's charismatic, and his family is famous. They tell Herb to dive down and get a wrong answer so that Charles can take over as the champion. Everything seems to go smoothly, that is until Harvard grad government agent Dick Goodwin is convinced that there's something wrong. He is determined to prove that the show is rigged and that 21 is ripping of America's intellects.Quiz Show is a great film, the acting, the picture, the editing, everything about this film is pretty much flawless. I couldn't believe that this film is not anywhere near the top 250, I don't see any problems with the film. But I know every film has a hater or two. But for me the film, acting wise, the film went to Ralph Fiennes, he did an incredible performance and was so touching during his statement to the jury.

The sponsors and network owners put pressure o the producers to replace him.  When WASP Charles Van Doren comes to audition for another show they offer to ask him the questions that he already answered at the practice.  Herbie is told to take a dive and Van Doren becomes an audience draw.  However when Herbie starts making noise about a fix, a congress employee, Dick Goodwin, decides to go after the network.This is a glossy, professional piece of work that sadly was never as huge as hit as it deserved to be (probably not enough explosions for the US audience).  The story is based on a true story that happened in the 50's and it's used here partly as a bit of history but also as a look at television in terms of it's most basic desire to sell and entertain at any costs &#150; if that means fixing shows or getting the `right' ethnic groups on screen then s be it.  It is effective on that level because it's hard to imagine anything has changed since 1950.  The actual human drama comes between Van Doren and Stempel &#150; the film makes them both real people, neither good nor bad but having a bit of both.Turturro is the best thing in this film.  His Herbie has so many levels which he must touch throughout and he does them all well &#150; whether it's humour, pride, anger or realisation.  Fiennes is good but at times I did find it hard to be sympathetic with a WASP born into a lofty family who gets more given to him.  That said Fiennes did him well.  Morrow was a strange choice &#150; famous at the time for Northern Exposure, he does a weird performance here &#150; almost doing an impression of what he thinks a tough Noo Yark investigator would be like.  The supporting cast is filled out with quality so deep that even the extras are famous now! (Calista Flockhart turns up briefly).  David Palmer and Hank Azaria are good as 21's producers, Christopher Mcdonald is good as the host &#150; people like Griffin Dunne, Mira Sorvino, Timothy Busefield and Barry Levinson come and go, and Martin Scorsese has a wicked role as the money behind the scandal.It works on many levels &#150; at it's most basic it is a true story of great interest, at best it lets you see how television works and how men with money can rarely be reached for any wrong doing.  Working on so many levels this is a polished professional drama that involves from start to finish.

Unfortunately, the end of TV innocence in the '50s brought us other game shows in recent years and real life survivor series that are guilty of shortcomings just as egregious in other ways but not to be discussed here. Manners and morals began a fast decline in the late '50s and only got worse with each decade, in my opinion.The real-life story of Professor Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), son of a famous scholar, Mark Van Doren (Paul Scofield) is told in a lively and detailed way with many sights and sounds of the '50s making the atmosphere look very authentic. When the less than charming winner of a TV show, Herb Stempel (John Turturro) is dumped in favor of the more charismatic Charles Van Doren, the story goes swiftly through a series of expertly written scenes in which all of the behind-the-scenes goings on are revealed and characterizations are sharply defined. In truth, the ratings game between Van Doren and Herb Stempel went on for many weeks before a showdown was reached.An especially touching scene shows Charles wanting to reveal to his father the truth about his upcoming appearance before an investigative committee--relaxing as the two have an informal midnight snack in the kitchen, but unable to tell his father (played to perfection by Paul Scofield) who is a symbol of unwavering integrity. In fact, Scofield is so good in his supporting role that it's a pity the script didn't expand his role to give him more screen time.John Turturro as Herb Stempel has the unfortunate task of appearing to be an obnoxious nerd, whose only redeeming moment comes at the end of the film when he realizes how destroyed Charles Van Doren is by the revelations. He never tries to make the character anything less than the boorish, self-absorbed fool he is and does an excellent job. Rob Morrow is sometimes less than convincing as the tenacious investigator.Despite its lengthy running time, it all moves along at a brisk pace under Robert Redford's outstanding direction. Well worth your time, although I can't say television has raised the bar very much since its fall from grace, especially with regard to daytime talk or game shows. Are audiences any wiser today?

Hank Azaria had a relatively small part, but is always a good fit regardless of the subject matter, a phenomenal character actor who has finally made quite a name for himself; quite overdue, I feel. Paul Scofield handles his role as Charles' father without so much as the slightest effort, it comes so easily.

The feeding of the right answers to both Stempel and Van Doren on the game show 21 did not bring the downfall to its paternal network, but made those who learned of this examine the prejudices concerning who should be on top and who should not and sadly did not exonerate those who were behind the scandal. That Stempel, one of 21's first victims, Jewish, should not be of what would be considered a man of privileged upbringing but Van Doren, handsome, WASP-ish, successful -- a university professor -- should just hits harder even today to the kind of people network television prefers. When we see that Ken Jennings, a milquetoast white man, is allowed to make so much money on Jeapoardy, we question the credibility of his win, and it extends even beyond game shows ethnic groups are still looking for their audience on a television mainly white in nature, and only a smattering of shows have included all racial groups in ensemble shows that have managed, through some shrewd writing and marketing, to survive.

Only a couple of years ago there was a game show over here where some people weren't allowed because they weren't 'fit for the screen', a nice euphemism for saying that they were just too ugly. So that I saw this in this movie didn't surprise me. But giving the questions and answers to the contestants, that was really something new. But apparently it really happened, because this movie was based on actual events.In the late 1950's, an idealistic young lawyer who works for a Congressional subcommittee discovers that game shows aren't always played honestly. He focuses on two contestants on the show 21 and finds evidence for the fact that NBC and the sponsor have been screwing with the system. He interrogates Herbert Stempel, an ordinary working-class Jew from Queens and Charles Van Doren, a member of one of America's leading literary families, although he doesn't want to blame them for what has happened. He wants to nail the TV-station, but when the official hearings are held, the big guns escape and the true victims are the two contestants...If you only want one reason why you shouldn't miss this movie than I would definitely say that you should watch it for the acting. John Turturro is excellent as the Jewish, seemingly media crazy Stempel. But Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren, Rob Morrow as the lawyer,... all did a fine job as well. In fact, I find it very hard to say which actor did the best job, because I liked them all. Of course they would never have been able to give away such a performance if there hadn't been a well-written and very interesting script thanks to Paul Attanasio.Normally I don't say too much about the writer but this time I will make an exception to my own rule. The reason for that is because Paul Attanasio isn't just an ordinary screenwriter. He is also a movie critic and many of the critics always say that they know so much better what a script should look like, but this man actually proves it by writing a very good one himself. But a good script isn't of course all the work. Without the good direction of Robert Redford this wouldn't have worked either.All in all this is a very good movie that deserves to be seen for many different reasons. Some very good acting, a nice script, good direction... this movie has it all. The only problem that I had with it was that it was a bit of a slow starter. But don't let that be a reason not to watch it. It's a very fine movie and that's why I give it a score of at least 7.5/10.

Quiz Show is the story of the scandal, and of the potential danger of the power of television. The movie focuses around two contestants in particular Herbert Stempel (John Turturro), the reigning champ at the start of the movie who the network decides it wants to dump in favour of someone more glamorous who can pull in higher ratings Charles Van Doran (Ralph Fiennes), a college literature professor. Stempel feels cheated of the glory that he feels was his due, while Van Doran is tormented by his desire to tell the truth, but also to cover up his involvement in the scandal.This is an interesting film that gives a fascinating look at the inside workings of the TV game show of that era. And it does paint a fascinating moral dilemma. As Dan Enright (David Paymer) - Twenty-One's producer - says to the Congressional committee that investigates the scandal, this was after all just a TV show; by definition a piece of entertainment. The sponsor sold its product, the network got ratings, the contestants made money and the public got entertained. Where was the victim? And yet it WAS dishonest. It's a fascinating issue, this whole concept of a victimless crime. And the ultimate irony was summed up by Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the head Congressional investigator the Committee got Van Doran, but what he wanted was to get television. In the end, as he says, television will probably end up getting them.All in all this was an interesting movie, although - strangely for a true story - I felt it lacked any sustained dramatic intensity. Remembering Jack Barry from the 1970's as host of the game show The Joker's Wild (he was also the host of Twenty-One), I was very impressed by Christopher McDonald's portrayal of him. Although the role wasn't really that central to the movie, McDonald had Barry down pat, and I felt as if it really were Jack Barry I was watching.All in all, this is a very good movie.

Just one cursory glance up and down his list of Directorial Credits, we find ORDINARY PEOPLE (Directorial Debut, 1980), A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992), THE LEGEND OF BEGGAR VANCE (2000) and today's victim, QUIZ SHOW (1994).The story here, in this film with the most generic sounding of titles, is that of the Television's Quiz Shows' rigging scandal of the 1950's. Accusations of TV producers' providing contestants with answers to questions that would later be asked as a part of a tensely fought on-air contest. Though there had been some early rumblings about fix by disgruntled Ex-Champion on TWENTY ONE, Herb Stempl, no one seemed to give any credence to such talk until there was an angry contestant on the Daytime Quiz Show, DOTTO, got angered about being double crossed. This started small, but soon now-balled into an avalanche; engulfing not only DOTTO'S and its fellow daytime 'Minor League' programs, but it also reached its tentacles up to Primetime and to THE $64,000.00 QUESTION (CBS)*, THE $64,000.00 CHALLENGE (also CBS ), but also the Jack Barry-Dan Enright production of TWENTY ONE (NBC).Having been an eyewitness of 10 years of age, I can remember well how this series made its debut, doubling the number of Isolation Booths over THE $64,000.00 QUESTION'S one (1); they added the element of competition between two (2) contestants to the suspense of one contestant's sweating it out, racking his own brain in pursuit the answers. Its first few weeks on TWENTY ONE, we saw a parade of moustaches, scholarly looking spectacles and goatees; all decked out double-breasted and tweed suits. Locked in intellectual jousting, fighting to the ultimate gray matter finish, no one seemed to catch-on with the public, personality-wise . With none of these Albert Einstein and Dr. Zarkov look-alikes getting any sort of substantial advantage toward holding that coveted 21 Championship Belt, Emcee Jack Barry abruptly stopped and removed the 2 competitors; promising to bring them back at a future date. (A surefire Kiss of Death, if you've ever heard one!) Enter the self-taught, super nerd, Herb Stempel (John Turturro).Herb racked up an impressive string of victories over the period of several weeks, managing to eek out wins over whoever came his way. The show was gaining a following, but the seemingly colorless Mr. Stemple was just not getting over with the public. His knowledge was admirable, of course; but lacking the charisma needed in the TV Business. TWENTY ONE needed a little tweaking to get it up to the level of a Star of the First Magnitude.Bring on Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes).Hailing from NYC, as was reigning Champion Stempel, he and Professor Charles were nothing alike otherwise. Herb was a Jew, educated in NYC's Schools and at the City College of New York, employed as some sort of clerical job. On the other hand, the WASP, Van Doren, was the son of a long tenured Literary Professor at the Ivy League, Columbia University. Charles qualified as an aristocrat, a blue blooded upper crust socialite. The Van Dorens no doubt, did not cross the Atlantic on board the Mayflower, but they surely were there when the trinkets were traded for Manhattan Island.Furthermore, the youthful, handsome and very eligible Charles proved to have a wide appeal to men and even wider sex appeal to the lovely, young ladies. Either way, Van Doren's entry into the fray created a super charged interest in all things academic. His face appeared everywhere, even on the cover of Time Magazine. ** So the nation was now witness a series of long, and drawn-out matches, all of which led them to ties, no decisions and great serialized TV fun and excitement. The Nervous Nerd Stempel vs. Prof Van Doren was truly a 15 Round Bout, winner take all.And finally the day, or rather, the evening came along when, at last the Van Doren-Stempel feud would be decided with Herb's answering ON THE WATERFRONT, instead of the correct MARTY. *** Mr. Van Doren began a long run in the King's Chair; one in which he lost a lot of weight and began looking frail and worn; until he also lost to whoever.

So they can include more commercials and make money. Why do contestants cheat on TV quiz shows? Well, yes, to make money too -- but more than that. They want adulation as well as new Caddies. At least Herb Stempel and Charles van Doren do -- brothers under two highly unsimilar-looking skins. This movie, at any rate, was chopped up by WGN, and a shame too. I thought networks had gotten pretty much out of the habit. What was lopped off consisted of small but highly revealing character touches, as is usually the case. What's missing from the print here, at least what came to my notice, are two relatively short scenes, whose importance as revealers of character I leave to you to judge. (1) Van Doren has been on the show and become a celebrity and has gotten used to being surrounded by envious and gushing young idolators. He arrives a bit early, before one of the campus buildings discharges its horde of students. And instead of alighting immediately from the cab, he pauses, leans down, and begins fiddling with his shoelace -- until the building opens and disgorges its young people, and then he gets out and is quickly engulfed as a bit of nutrient might be engulfed by a brainless amoeba. (2) Dick Goodwin visits the van Dorens and their guests (Bunny Wilson, etc.)at their Connecticut home, where everyone sits around the picnic table playing a kind of Shakespeare trivia contest. Dad starts a quote and challenges Charles to finish it and identify its source, that sort of thing. The erudite byplay of all concerned is enough to convince Goodwin that nobody from a community like this could be guilty of cheating on a stupid quiz show. The film rolls along with a lot of dash. Redford has a real facility in the use and placement of the camera. After several important exchanges he tends to linger on the face of one of the speakers, usually the one who has just learned something and whose mouth is left slightly open. The score is mostly of contemporary songs and intrudes a bit, seems loud. Charles van Doren may have envied and perhaps resented his father's fame (the movie hints that it was his desire to become as well-known as Mark that prompted him to cheat) but he's lucky to have had the father he did. Otherwise, master's in astrophysics and doctorate in literature or no, it's unlikely he would have been teaching at Columbia, even as an Instructor. (Talk about unfair advantage!) What is the movie's point of view? It's not completely spelled out, but it seems to be that it was okay for a nobody like Herb Stempel to cheat but not for someone with Charles van Doren's status. There's a certain reasonableness about this judgment. It's one thing for schmucks like you and me to steal towels from a fancy motel like the Tiki Waterbed Palace in Kansas City, but it means something entirely different if a celebrity does it. It's not part of our job descriptions to be models of rectitude, whereas we feel that famous professors and politicians ought to be. It seems an especially apt observation since in the case of quiz shows nobody gets hurt or deprived of anything. It's not a zero sum game. Under different circumstances, though, that's exactly what it is, and that's when cheating becomes not simply unethical but criminal. An armed robber is depriving another of something of value. Yet, our attitudes towards cheating must be very mixed indeed, to judge from the users' comments under The Cheaters. If you cheat in an academic decathlon, you're depriving someone else of something of value, although it isn't a material good, but rather a reward whose value is symbolic. At the end of this story, no one has profited. Stempel, the loudmouth who has been gunning for the blond Aryan, finally brings him down, only to discover that he feels not satisfaction but pity for the poor guy. Goodwin, who was after television, has torpedoed a comrade instead. The public loses its innocence. One or two network small fry are barbecued. And van Doren of course is ruined. The only winner is television itself, which will go on to bigger and better things like World's Wildest Police Videos. Why bother watching someone on TV exercise their brains when you can watch people smash up their cars on a freeway? It's difficult to believe that there was actually a time in our history when people would crowd around their TV sets and watch a contestant struggle to answer a question about the King of Belgium. Maybe Ray Bradbury put it best The television, that insidious beast, that Medusa which freezes a billion people to stone every night, staring fixedly, that Siren which called and sang and promised so much and gave, after all, so little. Gimme Survivor any day, and pass the sugar frosted flakes.

It is instead a commentary of how TV tends to make the worst out of people. TV is not the problem itself-but those who run the networks, producers and sponsors. They bought into the philosophy that The ends justifies the means Just get the ratings-it doesn't matter how you do it-just do it. So, Enright and company decide to Just Do it and they did. And the result was the scandal that that this film documents.I always liked Robert Redford as an actor and director-even if I disagree with his politics-but here he made a masterful film about the unfortunate true story of game show scandals of the late 50's. It documents Richard Goodwin's(Rob Morrow in a somewhat odd casting)investigation into allegations that shows were rigged. When he dug deeper and deeper he found that it was true.Once Goodwin appears on the scene, Enright and NBC executives go in I got to protect myself mode. By attempting to blame everyone else and pointing fingers at others. Truth is, the blame for this scandal can not be pinned on one person or another. The blame is extended to lots of people.Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren are not exactly guys in white hats. They both agreed to accept answers to questions in advance-and when Stempel was asked to take a dive-he did what he was told. I agree they were victims-but only because they agreed to be a part of the scandal and they were later dumped when the fraud was discovered. Van Doren could have been firm and refused to get on the show by dishonest means. Herb Stempel should have done the same thing. He also should have screwed the producers and give the correct answer to the question What picture won the academy award for best picture in 1955? MARTY That is what his wife wanted him to do but in the end he chickened out.The question towards the end of the film Who gets hurt Redford does not answer the question-but leaves it up to viewers to decide. I think it hurts every one involved in the scandal. Though no one went to jail, they were punished by society itself. I think Van Doren had a lot more to lose because of his family's reputation. He lost his job at Columbia Unisverity and never taught again-he was disgraced for life. He went to work for the encyclopedia Britannica-but he remains in seclusion to this very day. Stempel was hurt too-but he didn't have a reputation to protect. He went to work for the New york city transit department. I come to the conclusion that whatever damage that was done was brought on by themselves.Has TV learned it's lesson? Not really. I do think the TV audience has learned. I think People now know that not everything in TV Land is what it appears to be. People also know just how corrupt TV can make people-even those with the best of intentions can become corrupt.Maybe it was a scandal that had to happen to wake people up to the realities of TV-and without proper discipline and checks and balances-just how corrupt TV can become.Great Film by a great actor and Director-Rent or buy it today!

It answers why an Ivy League professor from a respected family threw it all away and obliterated both himself and his family's name. Redford does a great job especially with the Scofield and Fiennes scenes. This is the existential core of the movie; this dynamic, father and son, that will reveal to you why Van Doren made the tragic mistake. Watch at the birthday party how peripheral Charles is to the family, how dismissive his father is of him, indeed, all through the movie most of Charlie's attempts to even capture his father's attention, which is the fatal flaw, are ignored by Scofield. He treats Charlie with a courteous lack of interest which really unnerves Charlie. This is the answer to the attacks of Charlie and Goodwin's relationship being phony; to the contrary, the man is starved for affection from his larger than life poet father. When he discovers that Goodwin has a Harvard education, he becomes a surrogate for his father. Redford's answer to the conundrum is that Charlie destroys himself and his family trying, desperately, to impress his father. If this were all there was, it would be your typical family conflict film, it isn't.From the opening, with the radio announcer ominously intoning that Sputnik was flying above their heads, Redford wishes us to see that the ridiculously complex questions were tacitly known as phony by the audience but due to the panic, within this Zeitgiest, people desperately needed a Herb Stempel or a Charles Van Doren. When you hear the painfully esoteric questions, honestly, Redford is implying that the charade worked for so long because there was this wonderful cultural symbiosis between the corrupt network, its stooge contestants and the frantic audience who needed to believe that, despite Sputnik, our nation was full of rustic and urban geniuses just waiting to be discovered. For me, the movie works because besides the tragedy of Van Doren, Redford makes all the people of the audience accomplices. This is the point of the constant references to how we are losing space to the Russians. The core is this poor man's need to be noticed, existentially, by his father, who may be there physically but treats Charlie like a none too fond of pet.My favorite scene is the final mutual bitter look between Charlie and Goodwin. As the note at the end points out, everyone came out of it wonderfully; all Goodwin accomplished was to obliterate Van Doren and his family. When their eyes meet, you can see the bitterness in Charlie's and guilt in Goodwin's. My other is where the producer is asked by Charlie what Kant would think of him cheating and the idiot says I'm sure he'd be fine with it. Charlie never realizes the canyon, ethically and intellectually, between himself and these ratings lusting cretins. You should watch the movie because it teaches you a great lesson taught by Freud's apprentice Alfred Adler. If you do not get love as a child, sadly, often the rest of your life is a quest to obtain that which you existentially were deprived of this is the tragedy of Charles Van Doren. A wonderfully complex interwoven narrative with great acting full of pathos. We all can learn from his fall; This was worthy of all the awards. A Great, Sad Film.

That doesn't happen often, but the movie was that good, even with a one-note plot, and no action or romance. Yes, it did bring back 60-year old memories, sometimes fond, sometimes not. First a few words on historical context.In the summer of 1955, Revlon cosmetics experimented with a big money quiz show, not sure how it would work in prime network time. It was called the $64,000 Question. Up to that point, quiz shows, whether radio or new-fangled TV, offered only small amounts of prize money. So this was an unimaginable amount to offer. Not surprisingly, the show was an immediate hit, earning a permanent place on the CBS network. Viewers were clearly enthralled, especially when a delicate little Dr. Joyce Brothers showed off her expert knowledge of Boxing, of all things. Thus, it was possible for contestants to win not only big money, but become minor celebrities in the process, that is, if they caught the public's fancy.Of course, network programming being a commercial enterprise, imitators soon followed, the most successful (I think) being Twenty-One. Unlike $64,000, it had the distinction of two contestants competing against one another from inside the famous isolation booths. There viewers could watch them sweat as they pondered their answers. The format was also a come-on since most everyone had played the simple card game of being the first to reach 21 in point count. I think this format had the most built-in drama of any other TV quiz show, which by 1956, were at least several.The movie, of course, exposes the biggest scandal in quiz show history, which occurred in 1956-57 on Twenty-One. I was in high school at the time and never missed these shows. I think it's fair to say that practically all viewers believed the shows were honest&#x97;I know my family did. And that's even when quiz-whiz Herb Stemple missed probably the easiest question asked him, namely, who won Best Picture Oscar from just 2-years earlier. We all shouted Marty at the screen while he appeared terminally stumped, and we felt suddenly superior to this know-it-all. Likely, more discerning viewers suspected something fishy from that point on. But remember, this was the 1950's when, coming off a triumphal big war, most everyone still believed unquestioningly in authority. My friends and family certainly did. So when the rigged nature of Twenty-One was exposed in 1959, the public was generally shocked, especially as fair-haired boy Charles Van Doren was implicated. In fact, the big money quiz format was so discredited, it didn't revive for many decades.The movie itself amounts to a narrative triumph. Skillfully scripted, acted, and produced. The contrast between the nerdy-looking Stemple and the aristocratic Van Doren is striking. So, in retrospect, it's not surprising that producers Barry and Enright would see real ratings potential in a good-looking guy with a well-known family name. Fiennes's smirking Van Doren comes across as a rather slimy character once he's been compromised. Still, that scene of him amid the outdoor intellectual gathering is one a commoner like me can only imagine. As a result, I can understand how he could be seduced into establishing a reputation separate from his illustrious father (Scofield). Then there's the blue-collar Stemple harrumphing around his cold-water flat, having trusted the producers to come through for him after he took the humiliating dive. At times he's almost a comedic figure in his thrashing about.I guess my only reservation is with Morrow's casting as the bulldog investigator Jim Goodwin. To me, he doesn't project the kind of force necessary for untangling the shenanigans or tangling with stone walling network bigshots. But then, maybe he's intended to be a Peter Falk type Columbo with his disheveled appearance and mild manner. Be that as it may, the network honcho's are well cast and appropriately slippery as they seduce Stemple and Van Doren with prize money and promises of network jobs. Viewers can almost see their numbers-crunching brains in action. Tellingly, no woman is featured in the two hour runtime; and as an odd moment of curiosity, there's no indication whether Van Doren's successor Vivian Nearing was fed her answers or not.Anyway, the movie's fascinating in what it shows about the corruptive potency of TV ratings and commercial sponsors, a risky marriage that nevertheless endures. Thanks Robert Redford for reviving this sorry episode for generations later than mine.

It's one of the smartest and most sophisticated films I've ever seen about the meaning of truth in a socially practical sense.Redford tells the (true) story about a fixed quiz show very thoughtfully. He passionately sympathizes with the side of truth, but he's also smart enough to not get out of his role as an observer either. He trusts the viewers to meditate about the subject themselves and to each individually draw conclusions about how meaningful and valuable truth really is in our current system.I've always been interested and fascinated about the illusion of truth and the practical side of lying. Everyone knows that being truthful and honest is the right thing to do as a human being, but paradoxically it also seems that, in our practical society, making your own truths can make you much more successful. It goes even further. When you're able to keep up a specific strong illusion of truth, you can even fabricate a situation where everyone involved seems to get an advantage out of it! It's only when the bubble actually bursts that most people start to realize that they prefer the truth over fabrications, even though it's sometimes hard to rationally explain why.I guess people are so angry when they are confronted with other people's lies, because lies can also produce very terrible consequences. It's impossible to truly draw a fine line between when it is acceptable and when it is not. A society would implode if there wasn't any certainty of truth anymore, because there would be no trust. A whole society can lose its credibility just as much as one individual can.You, yourself, can choose what kind of person you want to be. 1) You can be one of the many people who tries to make a profit from that inevitable, immoral loophole in our society. The immorality of lying can be compensated by the generally good (personal) consequences those lies might carry with them.2) You can be a person who believes in the values of honesty and trust and who believes that those values are an inherent part of the moral foundations of a free society. Bending the truth to gain profits can have horrible, sometimes unforeseeable side effects, even if it's only in the long term.The most valuable thing this film may actually show, is that it is especially important to be aware of what both sides of the argument imply and ultimately may have in store. It's a very interesting film overall. It's well acted (the cast is fantastic), it's very solidly directed (I wonder if Redford got any tips from Scorsese, who played a small role in the film) and it has a very strong script about themes that will always be endlessly fascinating to me.

Quiz Show examines the public's right to the truth and perfectly captures an America bobbing in the wake of McCarthyism.Robert Redford brings his filmmaking pedigree to this adaptation of the Richard N. Goodwin book documenting Goodwin's (played by Robert Morrow) investigation that ignited the quiz show scandal of the late '50s. Paul Attanasio's screenplay weaves a story of TV bigwigs and little everyday men blinded by tastes of fame and money, along with the public deception they engaged in for their various reasons.The film begins predominantly with Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a contestant on the popular NBC primetime game show Twenty One. Herbie's long run on the show is about to come to a halt as the producers have seen their ratings plateau and want to bring in a new face to liven things up. Producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) tells Herbie he must throw the next show (in Herb's words, take a dive) by flubbing an answer to a question as simple as who won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture.Herbie is replaced with Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the unremarkable son of a wealthy Pulitzer winner with a mind for trivia. Enright and co-producer Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) propose an agreement in which they'll feed Charles answers to questions he already knows. He's rich, the public is enthralled and the ratings go up &#x97; everyone wins.The film builds this story for awhile until Richard Goodwin comes into the picture as a member of the legislative oversight committee for the House of Representatives. Goodwin senses something is awry with these quiz shows and slowly uncovers the truth.Quiz Show isn't suspenseful from start to finish given it's clear the fraudulent quiz show operation will be exposed at some point, but what's fascinating to watch is how these otherwise small men in Stempel and Van Doren deal with the situation as it unfolds. How warped their egos have become after they agree to commit the slight transgression becomes a factor in the film. Are they good guys or bad guys, or more appropriately, how black and white is this situation, really?Equally intriguing is how Goodwin goes about interrogating all the parties involved as if private eye solving a murder. He demands the truth and it becomes apparent as hearings begin to be held that the public does too. Quiz Show paints an honest portrait of the business back in the '50s, the way that the TV people in that age were so dedicated to the dollar and justified everything as it's what the people want. Things haven't changed so much, however. We now willfully indulge in contrived situations, believing that what the TV shows us is in fact the reality. Quiz Show, even today, reveals to us that while we demand truth and honesty as consumers, we also long to believe and prefer it to skepticism because it's so much easier.

Before every household had their furniture pointed at the TV, news reels in cinemas were a medium in which governments filled people's heads with propaganda, quite easily manipulating viewers into believing that what they were seeing was fact - after all, back then, it was the only way to see what was happening outside of your own country, without actually leaving it yourself. As soon as studio heads realised how gullible audiences were, they seized the opportunity to rake in the cash. With the explosion of the Internet making the world relatively tiny, you would think people would be more aware of the dangers of believing what they see. Yet reality TV, a sickening creation that quite obviously plays out scripted scenes in natural environments, still has people duped. It seemed a fitting time to re-visit Robert Redford's thoroughly underrated Quiz Show, a meditation on the unrivalled power of television, and the hold it can have over a nation.In 1950's America, Twenty One contestant Herb Stempel (John Turturro) wows audiences every week with his encyclopaedic general knowledge. With his approval ratings wavering, the big studio heads decide America is tired of cheering for the underdog, and order Herb to be removed from the show. Producers Dan Enright (David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) seek out a poster-boy, a figurehead that would give American someone to look up to, and ultimately aspire to be. Freedman spots Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) auditioning for another show, and immediately snaps him up, offering the chance to win big money with relative ease - he will be given the answers. Van Doren is handsome, well-spoken, highly intellectual - the complete opposite to the mentally unstable Herb, who is paid off to lose to Van Doren. With Van Doren becoming a national treasure, Herb is appalled and takes his claims to the Grand Jury, catching the eye of young Congressional lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), who takes a special interest in the case.Artistic license was obviously taken with Quiz Show, but Redford uses his directorial skill to create a crime story with no crime and no criminals, and no mystery given that the audience are in on the rigging from the start. So, the film is left as a damning portrayal of naivety, and a disturbing insight into the machinations of the most powerful corporation in the world - television itself. Goodwin, the Uncle Tom of the Jews is an outcast Harvard graduate, a small man in stature and societal hierarchy, believing that exposing this manipulation with cripple television and ultimately cause it to re-evaluate itself. Of course, it is Stempel and Van Doren - the pawns (albeit guilty pawns) - that suffer the most, being humiliated and having their reputations rocked, while studio head Robert Knitner (Allan Rich) and the executive of show sponsor Geritol, Mark Rittenhome (Martin Scorsese), emerging unscathed. Hanging Enright and Freedman out to dry, Rittenhome explains to an appalled Goodwin that audiences forget, corporations don't. The footnotes at the end of the film explain that Enright and Freedman returned from their exile a few years later, becoming millionaires in the process.Quiz Show is also a fine character piece, and while Rob Morrow grabs the majority of the screen time, it is Ralph Fiennes who truly impresses. Van Doren could be viewed as a rather despicable character; a man who sells his soul for money he doesn't really need, and for fame it brings him. Yet in Fiennes' hands, Van Doren becomes undeniably human, causing you to truly evaluate your own ethics, and what you would do if placed in a similar situation. This feeling is shared by Goodwin, who befriends Van Doren despite investigating him. He sees Van Doren as a victim who has been swept up in a tide of money and fame, manipulated in the same way as the people watching him, and it is the friendship between the two that is the beating heart of the film.What makes Quiz Show so enjoyable and enthralling is the fact that it never lets its weighty issues get in the way of the emotional drama, and is a quite fascinating story to boot. Redford depicts Goodwin's struggle through legal bureaucracy, juxtaposing it with his refreshingly stable home life with wife Sandra (Mira Sorvino), a factor that can often be intrusive in movies about real events. We also witness Van Doren's guilt-ridden relationship with his famous father Mark (an excellent Paul Scofield), and Herb's strained marriage to Toby (Johann Carlo). But it is Goodwin's reaction to the events that ultimately linger in the mind, with his resigned realisation that television is simply to powerful to fight proving a rather depressing sentiment. Perhaps more people need to see this film before they completely succumb to escapism, and we become a nation of red-eyed zombies.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com "},{"Title":"Quiz Show","Date":"30 October 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" QUIZ SHOW is a BEST PICTURE nominee of Oscar Race of 1994, the fourth film with Robert Redford at the helm, and earned him a second Oscar nomination for BEST DIRECTOR, but overtly its popularity has waned compared with its more esteemed fellow nominees (FORREST GUMP 9/10; THE SHAWNSHANK REDEMPTION 8/10; PULP FICTION 9/10 and even FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL 7/10).The authentic case of a young lawyer takes on a lawsuit case against the television chicanery has its general appeal together with its well-crafted characterization of the disparaging facets of the people who are implicated, the film runs smoothly to warrant a step-by-step incitement of moral inclination (either towards the contestants or the industry upper-echelon's entertainment-is-the-golden-rule motto and cheekiness). But eventually the sense-and-sensibility tug-of-war leans towards one sole individual, Charles Van Doren, a posh, demure young professor from a prestigious family, which certainly is not a false-move but Redford has it overkilled by his fatal deadening of the court procedures and simplifies the case to a degree of somewhat insultingly paying no heed to audience's I.Q., even though one would prefigure the superior stratum could get away with the charge, the story behind a producer swallowing all the liabilities and knowingly accepting to be the scapegoat should never be as concise as the film suggests, pitifully (but smartly) to the core of entertainment, Redford opts to a more crowd-pleasing route and Ralph Fiennes' personal charisma is the kill. Performance-wise, Fiennes, Turturro, Scofield are the three pillars, Morrow is the weakest link and bombed in displaying his top-student wisdom to tackle with the issue (particularly in a practical way).Due to the media difference, motion pictures somehow are allowed utilizing the poetic license when putting the real-life complex cases onto the big screen, so Redford shouldn't bear all the blame and anyhow the film is an above-average product out of Hollywood assembly line, what's more important its sarcastic and caustic depiction of the reality show business and the social standard of how media could manipulate its faithful audience has still been relevant hitherto.

Based on real events, Quiz Show is the tale of what happens when a beloved American past time turns out to be rigged. Young lawyer Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) stumbles upon a conspiracy behind the scenes of the popular game show Twenty-One, that is used in order to keep the winners that get the best ratings to remain the ones on the stage.The film, directed by Robert Redford and written by Paul Attanasio off of Richard N. Goodwin's book, is elaborately staged, focusing on several different characters from Goodwin to ousted and unstable former Twenty-One champion Herbie Stempel (John Turturro) to the new reigning champ, the prim and well-educated Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes). It's set up like a Shakespearean work of true drama, and Redford constructs it in such a detailed and extensive way that it all feels so resounding. There's not a lot to stick with you after it's over, but the way he plays it is so grand and alive, with Attanasio's script so seamlessly weaving together the rises and falls of these men.The whole thing boils down to the male ego in a fascinating way, with each character letting their pride get the best of them at various stages of their careers. There's a lot of talk about their wounded spirits, about what it means to be a man, about showing the world their worth and the drama that ensues as a result is wonderfully entertaining. The performances are marvelous all around, with the standouts being Fiennes and especially the manic Turturro. They breathe such life into these intriguing characters. Redford orchestrates it all with a swift pace that never gets dull for a moment and always left me entertained and wondering what was going to happen next. A very fine picture.

I generally have to be in the mood for a particular film, but I will always sit down and watch this one. It seems strange today in this post-Watergate era to believe it could have been considered scandalous at one time for quiz shows to be rigged. For that matter, today, I doubt many people would be surprised if you told them the Congressional hearings on the quiz shows were rigged. That is the level to which our cynicism has progressed. At any rate, this film excels on many levels. To begin with, the cast and performances are just excellent. Turturro excels as the completely unlikeable walking encyclopedia, Herb Stempel. He so badly wants to be admired and successful, but he is just SO unlikeable he doesn't realize that he IS unlikeable. His long-suffering wife played by Johann Carlo sees Herb's every flaw yet loves him anyway. In this he is truly lucky, but he just doesn't see it. Besides his Jewish heritage, Stempel seems to have cluelessness in common with Robert Morrow's Richard Goodwin. Goodwin's character is center stage throughout this movie, and he is played as an exceedingly complex character. First in his class at Harvard, he has brains but lacks the worldliness to see from the beginning that corporate America's Goliath will never be taken down by his version of David and his sling shot of a subpoena. Long before Big Pharma got so big, the fix was already in.In this sense, Goodwin is the personification of the wide-eyed idealist. He still believes if you just present the truth to the public the correct outcome is inevitable. Finally you have Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Dorn, possibly the most tragic figure in all of this. He goes in to try out for one of NBC's quiz shows with the best of intentions, and ultimately trades his integrity for fame and fortune, although reluctantly at first. Van Dorn at first enjoys the attention and the money, but when Goodwin shows up at his door with a host of questions about the honesty of the quiz shows he seems to reawaken Van Dorn's conscience, and he slowly disintegrates into a pile of nerves who even goes out of his way to avoid the host of admirers he once welcomed. He seems relieved to indict himself before Congress and the nation, but pays a heavy price for his confession. Rounding out the cast is the excellent Paul Scofield as Mark Van Dorn, Charles' father. He is another wide-eyed idealist, and a tall shadow in which Charles has had to dwell until 21 comes along. The master stroke in this film is the cameo by Martin Scorsese as Martin Rittenhome, an executive with Geritol, the sponsor of 21. His short conversation with Richard Goodwin pretty much lays out the ugly truth of the situation - People do tune in to watch the money, and the same end could be accomplished by merely making the questions easier. He also mentions that the public has a short memory but corporations do not, and is thus confident that the NBC employees who rigged the show will never implicate anyone higher than themselves at any hearing. This fictional composite character is right at every turn, and the dishonored NBC employees even return to TV in the 60's with an even bigger hit - The Joker's Wild - something that would have never happened if they hadn't been willing to be the fall guys.

In this way, they are cheating people, breaking their trust and spoiling the meaning of QUIZ SHOW. We need to give respect of one idea and encourage people to participate. It is a saying that beauty is greater than brains. We have to give importance to both these things and have to respect for every human being on the earth.In this movie, I felt that how they were trying to play with people's feelings. When they were in trouble they did not even bothered about that person from whom they made so much of money and fame. They were so mean. Rather than helping, they ditched them, which is very bad and hypocritical. The thing I learned from this movie is never ever try people to take advantage of your weakness.

Intrigue to win, losers, winners, pursuit of justice... These are all common things in life. They also happened as a scandal years ago.We will talk about such a thing. The movie, Quiz Show, would be an example of great productions, indeed it is a must-see. Being based on a true story, Quiz Show may be more interesting than similar examples. It shows us '50s popular culture, how TV affects people and their lifestyles. It also shows us how things work on TV society. You may be able to notice every single detail, which this movie touches on, at a time. Or the more you watch it you can find out more about it. It is a very enjoyable movie I think. I do not know why, maybe it is because of the familiar actors who did great jobs on their performances. Ralph Fiennes, you may recall from Schindler's List and Red Dragon, and John Turturro, who you may know from the new Transformers series, did great jobs playing their characters. Giving the feeling of a person in these characters' situations is done perfectly by all actors. As you watch, you will see about it; but we are not going to talk about scenes and things which happened in the film.Rather than starting to talk about my ideas, we should analyze '50s American culture, daily life and other common things about people's life first. After the end of World War II, people in the USA started to return to their normal, stress free life. There was no war anymore. According to historical resources, consumerism had gained speed. People started to buy themselves new dwellings, designed for single families. Again according to resources, The U.S. Dept. of Commerce and The Bureau of the Census, about 3,288,000 out of 151,684,000 people were unemployed and average salary was $2,992. Then, entertainment gained importance. Television was the greatest entertainment in that era, as it is now. TV networks of that era - ABC (American Broadcasting Company), CBS (Columbia Broadcasting System), and NBC (National Broadcasting Company) - were in a race to lead the competition. Every single thing could be done under those circumstances. This movie shows us that people were watching TV and taking it too seriously. TV was the main relaxation of people, it was really a great thing to them. In the film, you can hear Herbert Stempel saying, That box is the biggest thing since Gutenberg invented the printing press, and I'm the biggest thing on it. After that point, owning a network company, being producer of a well known TV show would make these persons important or make them feel important, act like untouchable so they would proceed as however they want. A quote, said by Albert Freedman, who is one of the shows producers, and you can hear almost at the end of film, shows us that fact It's not like we're hardened criminals here. We're in show business. From that opinion, I would also had said that you do whatever you want in a TV show. Then you can say,  What the ? It's show business! What an audience wants, an audience gets. It was what they wanted!  Well, that might work... People trust justice, but sometimes it would not work as it was seen from outside. The thing is money. It was the main deal, it is and it will be. With great amounts of money, justice can be manipulated. If you have watched the show, you must have seen that the judge, who leads the hearing of fraud assertions about Twenty-One, cooperates with Dan Enright, the producer which is planing and applying the frauds. Good thing is, there are always honest people that show up on the right time, like Dick Goodwin.Great jobs always bring people great money. With more money, you can extend your business and make more money. This chain contiunes if you take advantages wisely. Great money would give you the power to open every single door. In movie, you can hear Dan Enright(E) and Herbert Stempel(S) speak SDon't do this to me, it's humiliating. E For seventy grand, Herb, you can afford to be humiliated That shows us the situation and manipulation power of money. At least, even an intelligent person, like a university lecturer, can be dragged into traps like this. As a result, unless big corporates are loyal to ethical values, happenings of things like these are more than possible.

Gullible would be the better description. As television came into more middle class homes of suburban tract house dwellers, the family hour centered around game shows and trivia buffs who wanted to guess my line, play 21, and name that tune. What viewers didn't know was the extensive corporate monies that manipulated who accessed the growing nation's airwaves. Geritol, Encyclopedia Britannica, and cigarette advertisers virtually controlled television and awareness of the public. Advertisers poured millions into television programs like 21, a quiz show that pitted contestants, many with extensive educational backgrounds, against the Joe Schmo underdog, Herbert Stemple. John Turturro plays the irritating, celebrity-obsessed Stemple to a T. When investigated by D.C. congressional snoop, Dick Godwin (Rob Morrow) for questionable practices, the corporate door is slammed. However, when the golden boy Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), from a family of academic elites, is outed by the envious Stemple, the quiz show hoax becomes a televised national event of disgrace.Redford's expose is a morality play within a film about television that is a superior story of ethics and capitalism run amok. How the American public was snowed by the medium and corporate manipulation of geek Stemple, a man with a face for radio versus the upper-class Van Doren, and Godwin, an ambitious Harvard man who believed in the American justice system is the triangle and grand story.Redford does not over look the numerous details of an era when Ike and Mamie were chic, the GI-Bill was a means to making a better life for the millions of returned veterans, and Geritol guaranteed freedom from tired blood. It is a tale of the past as corrupt as today, but without the internet, cell phone camera shot, and bloggers to give us an instant condemnation of celebrities with feet of clay.

However, the questions were so hard that games often ended in 0-0 ties. NBC higher-ups were desperate to try to get the show the needed ratings boost. Show producers Al Freedman and Dan Enright came up with the idea of screening for Good looking, often stereotyped, WASP contestants. To insure the show's success, popular contestants were given questions and answers that were to be used on the show in advance to keep them on the show longer.The movie analyzes in depth how many played along with the charade. Contestants were scripted not only with the questions and answers they would be asked on the show, but were also coached on how to answer.

How to show just the right amount of emotion when responding.)Herb Stempel was a geeky Jewish kid from Queens New York who was sharp and smart, but rapidly losing popularity with the Twenty-One audience because he had a dull personality. In contrast, Charles Van Doren was an aspiring English professor out of Columbia University. He was brash, charismatic, good looking, and was talked by Freedman and Enright to appear on Twenty-One as Stempel's most famous challenger.Van Doren had wanted to play legitimately, but Freedman and Enright were convinced that Herb was unbeatable and demanded that Stempel take a dive on a Movie Category question. What Motion Picture Won The Academy Award for Best Picture in 1955. Herb Stempel had seen Marty, the correct answer, many times. However, he was forced to pause, pretend that he didn't know the answer, and demanded to answer On The Waterfront.The movie traces Herb's outrage at being manipulated and exploited by the producers in being forced to throw his tenure at Twenty-One on such an easy question. Herbie decides to bring about Richard Goodman, who heads a Senate Subcommittee, to expose Van Doren, Freedman, and Enright for their fraudulent, unethical, practices. It is later discovered that Stempel himself was also given questions/answers in advance. Therefore, he was himself a player in a rigged game.Many of you will experience outrage over how Freedman and Enright manipulated and deceived the public in this historic film. The actors do a brilliant job in recreating their famous roles. Even supporting actors play their small roles to perfection.A few differences between the movie Quiz Show, and the actual Twenty-One Show1.) Charles Van Doren and Herb Stempel played a series of scripted tie breaker games before the famous Marty movie question.2.) The question about Marty was worth 5 points, not 3.3.) Questions in the movie that recreate the famous Van Doren-Stempel final match were not the same as in the actual show. They were a composite of similar questions asked throughout the run of the show.4.) Van Doren won and became new champion when he elected to stop the game in the second round .5.) According to Game Show historians, only the first showing of Twenty-One was not rigged (but the questions were too hard, resulting in several 0-0 tie games.) The last show was also not rigged because Freedman and Enright had been exposed and tried to make the game legit at the last minute, but it was too late because the scandal had long been established.Quiz Show is a brilliant portrait of director genius! It's so good, it feels more like a documentary than a movie!

Along the way, it looks at who we route for, and why. And the answers are most surprising.Quiz Show is set in the 1950's, and revolves around the popular game show 21, where contestants who answered questions correctly won big jackpots. At the start of the movie the big champion of 21 is Herbie Stempel (John Turturro), a very intelligent man, who also happens to be brash, abrasive, and Jewish. Unfortunately, this is not a combination that resonates well with the public. Consequently, when Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), the son of respected college professor, Mark Van Doren (Paul Scofield), and himself a very intelligent college professor, auditions for the show. He seems like a godsend. He's young, handsome, charming, and Christian. While it's very likely that he would beat Stempel in head to head competition, the producers decide to make sure that the more likable contestant wins by asking Herbie to take a dive. Herbie does, but when his popularity disappears once he is no longer on the show, he seeks revenge by cooperating with Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow), the agent investigating the quiz show. Meanwhile, the producers of the show have decided to keep Van Doren winning no matter what, so over his protests, they give him the answers ahead of time. Goodwin investigates Van Doren, and is charmed by him, not wanting to believe that Van Doren is involved in fixing the outcome of the show. However, the more Goodwin delves, the more things point to an answer that he wishes weren't true. The resulting scandal shocked the nation.It's an interesting premise, in that, you can rig the outcome of a show, but still give the audience a suspenseful and entertaining program. And also, the most capable or knowledgeable is not always the one the public wants to see win. This dilemma is presented very well. The characterizations are wonderful, in that all characters have both their good and bad points, and no one really emerges as totally hero or villain. All of which makes us take a hard look at ourselves.The acting was superb. Morrow portrays Goodwin's tenacious well, and contrasts it with a surprisingly down to earth person. Turturro does an excellent job of playing a man who is book smart, but people stupid. Fiennes is charming as Van Doren, so much so that you don't want to see him fall, but his weakness is too well defined to allow him not to. Scofield's portrayal of the loving and yet disappointed father is touching and heartbreaking.The movie really has the feel of the fifties, which is a good touch.All in all, a thoughtful and though provoking film, well worth viewing.

I remember watching this week that Jeopardy! ace Ken Jennings who won $2 Million last year from seventy-four games, lost to another opponent in which throughout the final games, Ken wasn't the same as he would answer quickly in previous games, but would make goofy faces as he loses. In Robert Redford's film, we discover how the producers of NBC's Twenty-One rigged every contestant on the show where eventually somebody would find out.The name of the game is Twenty-One and like Jeopardy! itself, the game show has various categories from history, science, math, movies, etc., and the champion is Herb Stempel (gifted actor John Turturro) a Jew living in Brooklyn who has won over various tournaments with a winning streak of over $100,000 where he knows all of the commercials by heart, and is being bribed by producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) so that way the show can get a new contestant who is better looking and not that hideous to TV viewers.During interviews for contestants, a pretty boy WASP teacher name Charles Van Doran (Ralph Finnees) tries out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough were Enright tries to get Van Doran into the show Twenty-One to beat Stempel, and decides to go through with it, just because Enright B.S'd the cause of education to him.Now after Van Doran has beaten Stempel, Redford shows the audiences the ups and down of a successful individual having fame, getting the answers from the producers, and losing the persona he once had.Attorney Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow, another gifted actor) reads Stempel's article about Twenty-One being rigged, so now Goodwin is investigating whether the incident is true or not and if Van Doran is being fed the answers from Enright instead of looking the answers by himself.Quiz Show is not just a movie, but a document on what goes on the inside of a game show where the next time you watch a game show, you ask yourself Are these people actually smart, or are they just being fed answers like everybody else? Are game shows discriminative towards people of genders and races? Or for the matter, is Ken Jennings really smart, or did Alex and the gang from Jeopardy! feed him the answers and later played him a fool?

The news, the weather, the traffic, it was all a show, for our entertainment, to make money for the TV stations. Perhaps his cynicism was rooted in the game show scandals of the late 1950s, most notably the ones involving the NBC show 21, Presented by Geritol, and is the subject of the Robert Redford directed movie, Quiz Show. It's too bad this movie came out in 1994 and not 1999 when TV game shows were hot (Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ring a bell?), but still a good movie on its own, well worth a look. It is especially interesting if you have any fancy for the world of television, as the behind the scenes play that occurs is fascinating. John Turturro immerses himself in the role of Herb Stempel, a book-smart Queens native who is first supplied the answers to stay on the show 21, but is then asked to leave the show by incorrectly answering an easy question. After losing to Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a well-to-do intellectual in a family of intellectuals, Stempel begins to talk to the government about his life on the show, and that peeks the interest of a low level congressional subcommittee investigator, Dick Goodwood, played by Northern Exposure's Rob Morrow with a great Boston accent. The internal strife of a Columbia teacher, first appearing on TV, which is still looked down upon by some smart people, and this was before Fear Factor, then having to face the fact that cheating was involved. This movie looks good, has some great music from the time period, maybe it goes on a little too long in one scene where the Van Dorens are trying to prove how smart they are, and the ending was just there, I'm not really sure if we got anywhere by the end, but I still think it's a worthwhile movie, and you can see how decisions are made in show business, both in TV and the movies, and how we, the public, do not really know what is real, and what isn't. The reality TV explosion of the past few years comes under greater focus after watching Quiz Show. Are we still being duped? And what did Geritol really do?

Rob Morrow plays Dick Godwin, an investigator for a congressional subcommittee, that reads an article in the paper that grabs his attention about a closed-door judicial hearing about a show he enjoys watching. Looking for a good challenge, Godwin decides to investigate the case and see if he can take the famous quiz show 21 down.Morrow is aided by a show's former contestant Herbie Stemple, played by John Turturo, a blue-collar Jew trying to make ends meet and is enraged, both by the fact that his 15 minutes of fame are up, and also by the fact that the producers of the show made him take a dive when his ratings were up. Godwin is eager to go along with Stemple until the ex-contestant claims that the show's current reigning champion, Ivy League college professor Charles Van Doren is cheating. Morrow, a Harvard graduate himself, has befriended Van Doren in his investigation and starts to ask himself what's really going on? The beauty of the movie is that we're asking ourselves that question as well too, as the script cleverly keeps some of the secrets from us until a little later in the movie.The movie's moral frame interestingly rests on Morrow's character Godwin, who clearly has a better sense of right and wrong than anyone else in the movie, yet isn't quite sure what to do with them. When someone asks him, `If someone offered you thousands of dollars to appear on TV and cheat on some questions, and no one would ever know, would you do it?' Godwin unflinchingly says he wouldn't without a second of hesitation. The movie's suspense comes from Godwin's search for clues, but there's an anticlimax here because he solves the puzzle but when it's all over, he finds himself looking back and wondering if his efforts really changed anything within the system. Herbie Stemple has a similar anticlimactic moment as well.This film is one of my favorites just because of the overall attention to detail. A lot of the suspense and drama is cleverly drawn out and the sets have an authentic 50s feel. More than anything else, I think the characters are really just engaging and that just helps keep us gripped on the drama. For example, Charles Van Doren seemed to me a creation that goes against so many Hollywood stereotypes. Most good looking guys in movies have girls with them, but Charles Van Doren never really had a love interest in this movie, except for a couple fractions of scenes where he's taking out a girl, most of the time he talks about how too many girls crowd around him. He also seems to like and admire his dad more than most adult sons do, at least as seen on screen. Those characteristics of Charles Van Doren struck out at me, especially because of his eagerness to befriend Godwin more than he really need to if he was doing it entirely for ulterior motives.

Unscrupulous Enright and Freedman forces Stempel to lose on an easy question. Van Doren's TV success soon brings him out of the shadows of his renowned intellectual father. Stempel is frozen out and he goes to a grand jury. Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) is a congressional investigator who starts to investigate the game show.This movie is anchored by two amazing performances. John Turturro is at his jittery sweaty best. He provides the nervous energy while Ralph Fiennes gives the human fragility. It's a great character study of two fascinating personalities.

A work from a mainstream milieu and for a mainstream public, featuring renowned stars in the cast along with a celebrity as its director and producer, obeying to the most part of hollywoodian formal stereotypes, Quiz Show manages to be elegant in its aesthetics and narration, while taking the hardest of duties to suggest truth. The truth this film suggests is that very little, if anything, of what TV shows (and, implicitly, the entire mass media system) present is as it appears; the only rule being the maximization of audience shares and money gains, while manipulating credulous masses by giving them «what they like to believe»; the only reality being market, the sole truth being untruth.While watching, I was touched by the suspicion that Redford is better a director than a performer. The course of the film is strewn with thought- inducing fine particulars.

Turturro plays an intelligent man, a striver, but also a failure. He is very cynical. He is dishonest, but not really such a bad guy. He will never be fully integrated into American society. He will always wear a sign around his neck reading Jew. Jew because he makes no effort to hide his Jewishness and because he fits antisemitic stereotypes clever, dishonest, hook-nosed and ugly.(2) Rob Morrow is Turturro's opposite -- well-educated, good-looking, and highly successful as a hotshot young government lawyer. Morrow thinks highly of himself. He is super-ethical and is offended by other people's dishonesty. He greatly admires the Van Doren family -- the ultimate academic WASPs with a WASP house and WASP speech and WASP attitudes -- in principle above the dirty game of making money, their minds set on higher things. Morrow can integrate if he wishes -- but at the price of giving up much of his Jewishness. His wife sees this clearly and objects.(3) The producers of the rigged quiz show are Jews, as is the owner of the TV network. These characters are dishonest, indifferent to morality, and highly successful -- especially the owner, played with spine-tingling accuracy by Alan Rich.In contrast to these Jews is Charles Van Doren, played by Ralph Fiennes. He is tall, handsome, and American (i.e., a Gentile). He is like Morrow in being well-educated. He is like Turturro in being dishonest. He is even more dishonest than Turturro, since he is also a hypocrite.I have known all these characters. They are highly familiar to me. I can attest to how close to reality they are. The movie nails them. It gets them exactly right. A triumph.

This drama is mostly riveting and it has an interesting story to tell. It's well-directed film by Redford who turned out to be a good director. The acting is great by everybody. My only problem is this film runs a little too long and it seems stale at some points.Redford's film is based off a true story. In 1958, NBC started a game show craze especially with their hit show 21. When champion Herb Stampel is kicked out and replaced by the popular Charles Van Doren, NBC comes under fire as it's revealed that the champions may have been given the answers to the questions.As mentioned before, the acting is phenomenal. John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are great in their respective roles as the champions. David Paymer certainly makes a slimy guy. I was very surprised to see Martin Scorcese in an acting role, but I was very pleased.Overall, this is a decent film that goes on about corruption. Despite some staleness, I rather liked this film. It's not the best film of 1994, but it's easily entertaining. As for the subject matter, it's very hard to make a good mainstream film with it. But, somehow Robert Redford did it. I rate this film 8/10.

It can get away with not preaching because the consequences of their actions didn't harm anyone. It doesn't say, 'if you do something wrong you will be punished'. It says 'If you do something wrong, can you live with yourself'. It's the getting away with it I couldn't stand Charlie says at one point.A classical tragedy of a man with the world at his fingertips who throws it all away at his own volition.

The film tells the true story of a Congressional investigator (Rob Morrow) who is soon wrapped up in a web of conspiracy surrounding a popular game show called Twenty One. Now, the plot of the movie has always been something of interest to me because I always love a good quiz show now and then. The thought of a quiz show being rigged has entered my mind on occasion, and this film properly explores that subject in depth. One of the greatest aspects of this film is its performances from Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro. Turturro's character is the man who is told to take a dive because he is not as aesthetically pleasing as Fiennes' character, and their performances really help draw a line of contrast between the two of them. Rob Morrow also did a very good job in the film's leading role. The Academy-Award Nominated script is also something I found to be very well executed as well. There's some fairly memorable, compelling, and even at times amusing dialogue all throughout this screenplay and I truly enjoyed watching this story unfold on screen. Robert Redford's Directorial work really shines in his fourth film - he's proved himself to be a jack-of-all-trades. The movie also does an astounding job of exploring just how pivotal TV was to the American population during the 1950s. Overall, I felt that Quiz Show was a riveting period drama that presented a very fascinating look into the Game Show Scandal of the 1950s.

It is part morality tale and part character study, but most importantly, it is a showcase of outstanding performances by a top-notch cast.It is based on a true story, as told in a book written by Richard Goodwin, a congressional committee investigator who looked into allegations that a television quiz show, 21, was rigged. Rob Morrow plays Goodwin and delivers his best performance ever. He is not a leading man. But he is thoroughly believable as a gadfly with subpoena power.John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes are equally good as Herb Stempel and Charles Van Doren, respectively. Stempel is a long-running 21 champ who is booted off the show because viewer ratings are sagging. Van Doren, the heir apparent of one of America's preeminent intellectual families, is picked as his replacement. Herb is bitter and goes public with his allegations that the show is fixed. Enter Goodwin and his subpoenas.The supporting cast is excellent as well. David Paymer and Hank Azaria are the show's producers, Dan Enright and Albert Freedman, who first lie and try to cover up the scam. But they are finally forced to tell the truth. Which leads to an interesting question. Why does anyone care if a TV game show is fixed? It's just entertainment, and there is apparently no law forbidding television from making fools out of the American public.Really.We're not exactly hardened criminals here, Freedman says. We're in show business.All I can say is Quiz Show makes me care, and that I want the lie to be exposed. But I suspect a viewer's position on that question says more about the viewer than the movie. Also very good in much smaller roles are Johann Carlo and Mira Sorvino as the wives of Stempel and Goodwin, and represent just as much a contrast. Tobey Stempel is a grating nag who seldom has a kind word to say to her husband. In contrast, Sandra Goodwin is clearly a full partner with her husband who provides intellectual and moral support. It may be a little-sharp-edged at times. But it is support nonetheless.Robert Redford as an actor has always been something of an enigma to me. There always seems to be a distance between him and the audience. But somehow it works, and I am a fan of many of his movies - some of which I think are truly great, like Three Days of the Condor and Jeremiah Johnson.But as a director, Redford is much easier to understand. There is no distance between viewers and the movie. Viewers are right there with the characters on the screen. And he consistently finds top performances from his actors.Who knows? Maybe Redford is a genius.Either way, Quiz Show is a great movie. "},{"Title":"Rotten apple-pie","Date":"7 September 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" It is not just that we have been lied to, the film suggests; that the average schmuck plucked off the street, or even the photogenic all-American pillar of ethos that followed him, did not grasp the Dream with hard work or quick wits, but were rather the corporate stooges fashioned to con viewers. This is fine, Hollywood actors were groomed after all in the stardom that was meant, in one of many ways, to represent the plausibility of that Dream.But these people, so the story goes, conned viewers out of the reality of the frame; this is where it begins to really hurt. It is not that people expected television to be reality, a show was understood to be a product of fancy. But more, that people implicitly trusted their eyes to tell them what's what. Remember, all this was back in '57, and for the most part there wasn't even a New Wave to challenge erudite film-goers at Cannes or Venice about the artifice of the filmed image, much less the broad American audience sitting down at nights to watch a quiz show.So, it was all thought to be true as far as the eye considered. Into this staged reality about ephemeral glories and vain fixations comes the Redford film; by recasting the staged image inside another staged image - the TV show inside a detective film murking for truth against artificial realities propped up by an immaculate surface -, it re-appropriates what is essentially scathing about the actual events.Oh, the final vision is a user-friendly cynicism, such as has infused everyday life since the days when we discovered just how powerless, pointless we could be in the face of the grand schemes. It is very fittingly staged as a court-room trial; where, once again, there seems to be a script, audience participation, and actors performing, seducing with treacly soliloquy or stentorian morals. The important battles being fought are swept aside into the spectacle, the purely superficial, as in TV.So, eventually the unimportant fall-guy assumes all the blame, and the powerful higher-ups at the network and sponsor get away scott-free. And this is why it's all so scathing in both directions, up and down; they get away, but we know - and can, with hindsight, make the films about it. The cost has been our disillusionment with the media landscape. They're all meddling with the truth, of course, or are in cahoots with who serves their interest. This has been our revenge; even the slightest hint of rumor can damage public opinion, the network owner explains. So, the apple-pie has been rotten to the core.It is a fine film, story-heavy, the era minutely recreated, with some little imagination that moves. When the quiz show whiz scheduled to lose looks out from his box, about to answer wrong, we see the promise of TV lights reflected on his glasses.And there is some marvelous stuff about a son who has lived life with borrowed images from the father and now has to re-assert his own - by investing himself into a TV fantasy where every image is a fake. His deliberately wrong answer that would extricate him from the self-indulgent fantasy is about Belgian kings; he answers King Leopold who is the father, when the true answer - which he knows - is the son.

We never know as a viewer if we're accomplices or victims, it's up to us to take positions and to decide if the big TV star is one to root for or not. More than a plot device, this helps to engage us into the diabolical mechanisms that sometimes govern the modern Pandora box we -for the majority of us- grew up with.Antoine de Saint-Exupery said that Love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward together in the same direction. This sentence almost defines the very essence of TV. There's just something so fascinating in this little box, that converges the sights of millions of people from all the country, there's an odd equation between being on TV and being loved, as if the magnetic waves emitted by the screen filled the people's heart with a curious desire to be inside, this envy is translated into love, from the pride to know or to be close to the TV star. The producers got it right, audience wanted ordinary people to become stars, and when you have no talent in sports, or arts, the only weapon left for the schmuck is the intellect.Revenge of the Nerds can be a fitting subtitle for TV Quiz Shows, and the movie opens with the unlikeliest TV star, John Turturro as a man with a face for radio, the champion of the Twenty One, Herbert Stempel, a Jewish New Yorker at the pinnacle of his winning streak. But the lowering ratings aren't enough to compensate the awkwardness of Stempel and the feeling that the audience wants something new gets more and more palpable. So basically the idea consists on changing the nerdie as to change a light-bulb. And in the case of Charles Van Doren, the crooked producers, Freedman and Enright, Hank Azaria and David Paymer found the mother lode. The casting of Ralph Fiennes is perfect, his juvenile smile, rosy cheeks; exude a perfume of innocence while his voice maintain a serious dignity. Fiennes as Van Doren is so appealing that it makes his decision to sell his soul even more tragic for him, and difficult for us to accept.What would you do for TV, for fame, for money, for love? The film asks many questions in which silence can be the only non hypocritical answer. I won't extend the analysis to actual TV programs when any means justified to keep up the ratings, where at least the 50's had the decency to promote some intellectuality while today, muscles and tits replaced the brains. It could fill a whole thesis, and we already know that the majors and the sponsors always win. To make it short, let's say that the majors's cynical purpose is to sell some available brain time for the sponsors, and so-called entertainment is the hypnotic eye to let the viewer know that Geritol, is the best tonic in the world, to believe whatever they want, and the worst stuff doesn't necessarily concern the advertising department. TV got away with the scandal and this is precisely why I prefer to analyze the human aspect of the film.Quiz Show is a powerful drama about the consequences of adults behaving like children, it's about dilemmas and responsibilities. Behaving like children is having everything you dreamed of, without earning it, and living in the illusion that it will last, as in the denial of the existence of justice. But justice is here, and it's incarnated by the young Congressman lawyer from Harvard, Dick Goodwyn, played by Rob Morrow, the one who smelled something fishy at the first place. I thought in the beginning that the fact that he was Jewish was irrelevant, but actually, it helped him to have more affinity with Stempel who kind of convinced him that the WASP pretty boy winning over the geeky Jewish boy is not a legend, and with Van Doren on which he developed a real fondness and a profound admiration, falling himself in the trap of a childish attitude, in the sense of unprofessional.The characterization in Quiz Show is tactfully handled by Robert Redford's masterful direction. Stempel is more than a comic relief, he plays the victim with the tender flamboyance of the schmuck who still got his pride. Goodwyn is also weakened by his own affection to Van Doren, a corrupted soul whose only redeeming quality is to have inspired this friendship and more than anything, the love of his father, Mark Van Doren, the poet and the intellectual. Paul Scofield steals the movie with a nuanced but remarkable performance, as a man so convinced of the inner integrity of his son, we can't help but feel angry toward the son who broke such a noble heart. The Van Doren's tragedy is incarnated by two consecutive moments, the avalanche of applauds addressing the Committee member who wasn't fooled by Van Doren's eloquent speech, and the part that almost brought a tear to my eye, the devastation of the parents who learned that their son won't be a professor and that the name of the Van Dorens was tarnished or in the best case, would be forever associated to a sordid affair.Truth triumphed, Stempel convinced that he knew the answers he pretended to ignore, the scheme was revealed, but TV got away with it, that's the show business &#x85; even Stempel felt some empathy to Van Doren, as both ultimate victims of the media, a cruel arena condemning you to be eaten by the lions, the journalists and the movie ends with smiling faces representing the audiences as the Romans who cheered for the gladiators before condemning them &#x85; "},{"Title":"a compelling and excellent movie. loved it.","Date":"4 July 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" It's 1958, and the producers of the quiz show 21 have a problem.

Based on true events happened in 1958 we see two contestants of a quiz show and their contribution to one the greatest scandals of the 1950's. The first contestant of the show is Herb Stempel (John Turturro), a poor working-class Jew with a fantastic memory on several subjects. He's winning a lot of money on NBC's show 21 and people love him because he's a success on the show, answering correctly all the answers. But the show sponsors doesn't like him, thinking that he's ugly and boring and they ask to the show producer Dan Enright (David Paymer)to find someone different to beat Stempel and get more high ratings to the show. The answer to his problems is Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) a College teacher, born on a very influent and rich family. Now he's gonna compete with Herb on 21 but things are not what they appear to be.Enright asks Stempel to dive for a good sum of money and lose the game. He offers to Stempel the question and the answer that's gonna make him lose everything and worse he knows the correct answer and don't wanna be a part of it. Enright says that Stempel might have an future on TV, but he must lose. Stempel follows what Enright says and loses but nothing of what was promised to him happens and he gets mad. He starts to denounce the show and the producers saying that the show is a fraud, that everything is set up, and most shocking than this the contestants got the questions and answers before the show be on the air.Richard Goodwin is the responsible for investigating any quiz show problems. On his search he discovers that something is wrong with the show but he wants more. He approaches Charles Van Doren, the very popular contestant that's making the ratings of the network fly high. Van Doren's is starting to get upset with the investigation, after all he's a man of principles, he doesn't believe in fake acknowledge, he doesn't want to receive the answers before the show starts, and last but not least he's the son of the acclaimed writer Mark Van Doren (Paul Scofield) a man who taught everything from Literature until moral values. Here comes our questions, the viewers questions Why Stempel gave in? Why Van Doren wanted to be part of this show? Why an educated man, with a good life needs to change his values to participate in a game show? Why Goodwin thinks that people would be interested in knowing that what happens behind quiz shows is a scam? And most important Why the producers of the show couldn't make something real and opted for making an fraud?It's all about money. Stempel wanted money, he obtained the money in the show, lost and wanted more, something that Enright promised. Van Doren's rich, teaches at Columbia and gets a great paycheck but he knows that he can get more. The 21 producers and the sponsor proved that with an interesting and charming contestant on the show they get more ratings and they get more money. In a particular scene after Van Doren's lose (in a question showed to him but that wasn't part of the scheme) the producers send Dave Garroway (Barry Levinson) to make an offer to Van Doren, NBC's offering a millionaire contract to him so that he could stay on TV. It's all about vanity. Stempel and Van Doren's look was a decisive factor on why NBC and the sponsor preferred the richer guy over the Jewish guy. When a NBC's accountant (Griffin Dunne) tells the sponsor (Martin Scorsese) that Stempel's a very popular guy in Queens, the representing replies Queens is not New York (meaning that he wanted Stempel out of the show. Van Doren is an more charismatic figure, Stempel's has a problem with his teeth and talks too much.But this is also a movie about ethic, moral values, dignity or the lack of all these items. Probably many people will condemn Stempel's attitude after his loss on the program, claiming that he had a choice, and in the end his denounce was thrown back at him, making him a desperate person seeking revenge. In the case of Van Doren his name speaks loudly than everything. When a Commission is formed to investigate the 21 scandal, and Van Doren testifies in front of all Americans, all the judges of the Commission replies that what he did by telling the truth was courageous. There's differences between the same issue. The most absurd of the reasons of why the show has to be made of that unethical way is that the producers and the sponsors were working for the cause of education.And with all of that, Robert Redford created a thrilling film, with a fast rhythm in the first hour and a slower and full of thoughts in the second hour. Paul Attanasio delivered one the best screenplays of all time, here you can find humor, drama, curiosity and really learn many things. Quiz Show has a great ensemble cast, with all actors giving their best. It's really difficult to say who's best. Certainly one of the Top movies of 1994. 10/10 "}{"Title":"Inside the booth","Date":"24 February 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" This is real event from the 1950's.Audiences at home are glued to their seats as Twenty One, their favorite quiz show on NBC starts.What they don't know that the show is fixed.The producers arrange the outcome of the competition.Herbert Stempel, a long time contestant, has to step aside since they want a new contestant, the non-Jewish Charles Van Doren.Later Stempel speaks out what happened behind the scenes.Richard Dick Goodwin, a congressional lawyer starts investigating the case.Quiz Show (1994) is a very wise movie directed by Robert Redford.It's based on Richard Goodwin's novel Remembering America A Voice from the Sixties (1988) and it was adapted by Paul Attanasio.Its producers include Redford, Goodwin, Michael D.

An exquisite and beautiful film.The time is the fifties, the place America  the Soviets have just launched their Sputnik, the first man-made object to enter space, heralding the US-Soviet space race and heightening Cold War tensions ; Dwight Eisenhower is in his second term as US President ; and two in every three households has a TV set. To ensure greater viewership, the producers of certain TV quiz shows secretly provided the quiz contestants with questions and answers beforehand. This virtually guaranteed the shows' popularity, because the viewers just wanted to see the money, as one character says.Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren plays another of his idealistic yet morally ambiguous characters, who is sucked into the morass against his will by the producers' guile, and also by his own need for fame and attention. And so Van Doren comes to make his own little Faustian pact with the Devil. Fiennes is one of those rare actors, like Al Pacino or Michael Douglas, who simply exude charisma, and whom it is always a delight to watch no matter what they're doing. And yet it is John Turturro who steals the thunder right from under Fiennes' nose. If you really want to understand the phrase disappear into a character, just watch Turturro in this film. In his voice, his walk, his physiognomy and right down to the movement of his eyes, he becomes Herb Stempel, the geeky and disgruntled contestant whose antics lead to the whole controversy. Every scene he's in, no matter how serious, threatens to become uproariously funny.Robert Redford as director proves to be a consummate storyteller, fully self-possessed and in control of the medium. The story is told as part drama, part history lesson and part comedy. The script is so interesting that even though one knows the outcome, its a lot of fun watching it happen. Every line of dialog is perfect, every scene is necessary no more no less. The whole film is peppered with literary and scholastic references, from Shakespeare and Keats to more obscure figures like Proudhon. The Shakespearean motifs are especially pronounced, from the verse game played by Charles' family, to the comparison of Charles Van Doren to Hamlet.This is yet another film that enough people haven't seen, or have simply forgotten. One of the very best films I've seen in some time.

But Redford digs into something deeper, namely the power television (or any medium, for that matter) has over its audience and the responsibility of that audience to play an active role in processing the information that medium is feeding to it.With stellar performances from Ralph Fiennes, Rob Morrow, Paul Scofield and, yes, even John Turturro, an actor I generally resist.Grade A "},{"Title":"Engrossing and very well acted drama","Date":"3 February 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" This is an engrossing and very well acted drama chronicling corruption in a popular quiz show in the fifties.

Robert Redford's motive is to suggest the loss of innocence in America with the end of the fifties and the impending arrival of the culture wars and civil strife.

Very...in the right hands.","Date":"21 August 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" Robert Redford is a great actor and he has had a lot of success with direction too and it wasn't until I actually started watching Quiz Show which I had wanted to see for a long time that I realized Redford wasn't in the movie but rather directed it so that kind of disappointed me. Although I wanted to see the movie because I liked Redford I truly had no idea what it was about, and I also didn't realize how based in truth it actually was until the movie prompted me to look into the fact behind it which was a lot and very interesting. It's even interesting and pertinent now seeing as how Game Shows have once again become so popular and makes you think a lot about that sort of thing. This is the key to Quiz Show, there are some really terrific, powerful performances and the direction and writing is simple and yet brilliant. The film is intellectually well done and still very entertaining to watch mostly because of the terrific cast and characters. It doesn't necessarily point fingers or tell you who was wrong and who was right but really takes this scandal and draws it out for you piece by piece and shows you everyones side and how it effects them. Anyone who enjoys a good strong movie could sit down and watch Quiz Show and be entertained by it, or thought provoked by it, and can get a variety of reactions out of it which is one of the things that makes it so intelligent. It's not action packed but character driven and the cast is so well picked that they make the characters come to life and seem completely intriguing to carry this story.John Turturro, who is a first rate terrific actor plays Herbert Stempel, an every day blue collar guy who finds great success on the famous game show 21. Unfortunately his revenge antics gets the better of him when he is set up to take a dive and replaced by an intellectual ratings grabber. Turturro is brilliant in the role, case closed. You hate him and yet feel sorry for him all at once. Ralph Fiennes is absolutely amazing as new intellectual champ Charles Van Doren who literally as Eye of The Tiger says trades his passion for glory. His character is very conflicted, and a true anti hero in every sense of the word. He is amazing in this role and I've never seen him in anything much that impressed me like this. Rob Morrow is just amazing as the investigator in the Oversights committee Dick Goodwin who becomes attached to Fienne's character as a friend and tries to protect him while still doing his job to the very end. These three actors make this film everything that it is. While there are some impressive and strong supporting characters including the terrific and multi talented Hank Azaria and the subtle but well played performance by David Paymer, Morrow, Fiennes, and Turturro steal the show...no pun intended. Clearly they found a niche in each other because they have great chemistry together and tell a story that leaves you enthralled in such a simple scandal.So far I have only seen two of Redford's direction projects...the other being last years panned Lions for Lambs which on the contrary I thought was downright brilliant (see my review.) Redford seems to want to tell a story regardless of what anyone else thinks because he is passionate about the content. Sounds silly in reference to a story about a rigged game show but somehow the passion for the content comes through loud and clear and while I wasn't quite blown away by the whole film, the performances, and the delicate re-creation of the time period and the entire world behind the scenes of the game show was brilliant. As I said earlier anyone can watch this and take something away from it even if it's as simple as saying...well that a good movie. But there is some very intellectual properties underlying and the three main cast members make the film really terrific. A great watch and I encourage anyone to check it out!! 8/10 "},{"Title":"A Great Dramatic Telling of a Classic American Scandal","Date":"15 July 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" Herb Stempel (John Turturro) is America's everyman, with the exception that he knows everything. The star of Twenty One, he is asked to take a dive in exchange for a new contestant -- a more handsome Gentile with a notable family. He does take the dive, but soon regrets it and calls the local district attorney to investigate. Next, Congress gets involved and things snowball from there.Based on a true story, this was well before my time (1957-1959). But the idea is timeless... a heroic Congressional staffer who stands up to power to keep things honest for the American people. America needs more idealists like Dick Goodwin. And the story, which sells itself, is made even better with this stellar cast John Turturro, a grossly under-rated actor playing Herb. Ralph Fiennes as Charles VanDoren. Dick Goodwin played by Rob Morrow (Joel Fleischman on Northern Exposure), whose name is unfortunately not well known in film -- he really grabs the reins of this picture. Hank Azaria also appears, and Robert Redford directs. Martin Scorsese, Calista Flockhart and Ethan Hawke cameo.I've seen some complaints that the historical accuracy is a bit off on this one, but as near and I can tell it's about 95% right. And, folks, it's a movie. Entertainment. As Redford observes, if it was to be 100% accurate, he'd make a documentary and not a drama. Certainly there's some irony to all this -- a film accused of distorting the truth for entertainment being about a game show distorting the truth for entertainment. But, you know, I never felt deceived -- anyone who enters a movie based on a true story who expects perfection is grossly naive.I could go on and say how well-done the sets and costumes were for making this appear appropriate to the time, or how much I enjoyed the portrayal of VanDoren's father. But the important part is this the film was nominated for multiple Oscars, and this is one case where it deserved to win the ones it was nominated for. A powerful film -- engaging, dramatic and suspenseful. Like The Insider or Thank You For Smoking for the entertainment industry, a far less obvious sinister force than Big Tobacco.

Acting all across the board is great--especially by Turturro, Fiennes and David Paymer as an evil TV executive. Morrow is also good--but he tries to imitate a Boston accent and fails miserably (I should know--I have it!). It's a big distraction in the movie.

"},{"Title":"Solid character based drama focuses on ethical problems","Date":"26 December 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" I found this film very interesting -- it concerns the collapse of the game show bubble in the 1950s, when a famous professor's son became a quiz show champion only to be disgraced when it was made public that he had been given answers in advance.None of the characters did anything really all that wrong in terms of morality.... they lied, they cheated, but nobody was killed, and arguably other than fooling some people no one was really hurt. So this film really is an examination of ethics, of the ultimate importance (or lack thereof) of truth and integrity in the academic and governmental worlds.The 3 actors playing the principle roles are impeccable. John Turturro, always a convincing and riveting character actor, puts in one of his better and more substantial performances as the original quiz show champ, Herbie Stemple, who is deposed by the academic hot-shot Van Doren. Van Doren is essayed by Ralph Fiennes, who really steals the film in a lot of ways with his performance. He's tragic, you want to like him, but at the same time you know that his honesty and his integriy only go so far. He too has been corrupted by the money, and by the urge to distinguish himself from his father's fame and stand on his own. So ultimately you do feel sorry for him. Rob Morrow does a fine job as the government's man, Goodwin, who exposes the scam. He brings to the fore the real ethical problem that the film wants to expose -- the fact that the machinations of Congress and the anger of the American people were focused on Van Doren and the other quiz show cheaters, and not on the studio network heads and the corporate sponsors (a memorably low-key performance by director Martin Scorsese) who are just as responsible for the deception.One weakness -- I thought the character of Sandra Goodwin, played by Mira Sorvino, was either under-written or edited out of the film too heavily. At one point she and her husband have a really grisly argument about why he is not going to call Van Doren to the stand, and it really feels like her criticism (the intensity of it especially) is coming out of nowhere. I suspect a scene may have been deleted, or I would have to blame poor writing, but it really felt disjointed to me and my girlfriend commented to me about the same thing.All around a solid effort, one of Redford's best films.

This scandal occurred before my time, and at first when my friend told me the plot of the movie, I thought... so what?; that was in the early 90's before we were inundated with the reality trash we now see today; and this film is worth watching more than a few times to catch the innuendo and commentary, which is brilliant.For example, Marty Scorcese, when grilled by the senate ethics committee (well portrayed by Rob Morrow), as the slick CEO of Geritol. Young man, I tripled those profits, that's the kind of salesman I am, making people want Geritol!. He smiles smugly.Rob Morrow is the ethical lawyer, attempting to unveil the conspiracy of commercialism and public spin; a crime now permeated on the American public daily, and not only with game shows, but also politics, news commentary and talking heads.There are a few obstacles. Rob Morrow's Boston accent still sounds more like Brooklyn; Ralph Fiennes as the too-perfect Charles Van Doren, a young man duped into promoting the scandal, and representing the public demand for class differences and competition.John Turturro is excellent. After this film I have followed his performances more closely; he BECOMES Herbie Stempel, the man exploited by TV executives for his common looks and appeal to the mass audiences. Johann Carlo as his wife Toby is also noteworthy; proud of her husband she did not believe he was bribed to win the game show 21.David Paymer and Hank Azaria are right on the mark as sleazy TV executives. We can imagine the likes of these two producing The Apprentice, even today.Paul Scofield is also excellent, as Van Doren's father, a noted author and professor, who was disappointed in his son's sell out to the TV game show; representing the old school, when values meant more than money.

From Herbert Stempel to Charles Van Doren we have a range. These men were both geniuses, but Van Doren was the son of one of or great poets and critics and Stempel was just, well, Stempel. We idolize our pretty people (nothing new). Van Doren, of course, had to eventually face the music or face jail time. There were two golden ages of television. The first was when Milton Berle and his ilk caused people to put away everything early and watch each week. Jackie Gleason was also a part of this. The second began when TV began to exert its power. These big buck quiz shows were all over the place and the advertising revenue became phenomenal. How could one not begin to see the orchestration going on behind the scenes when such money began to speak loudly? Like the internet today, the media had moved beyond the legal system. One had to almost ask Did anyone do anything illegal beyond the basic limits of fraud. And if they did, who was harmed by it?The performances are wonderful here. Rob Morrow, who should be doing a lot more, is excellent as the bulldog investigator. Ralph Fiennes comes across so well as Van Doren. He has that little snobby accent down cold. We want to hate him, but he is part of a great family and so automatically demands respect. John Turturro as Stempel is a juggernaut. He knows what they have done to him and he is really offended. He is crash and boorish and smart. Not what TV really wanted. The scandal plays itself out in a believable, realistic way that is so nice to see.

They payed Stempel to take a dive so that a younger, better looking college professor could be the new champion on the show, in order to get more viewers and receive higher ratings. There is a good message about your own morals and choices in this movie, as the college professor has the choice of cheating and becoming an undefeated champion on the show, or do what's right and not receive that honor.

On the larger scale, acceptance of such dishonesty damages our whole society.Before the scandal broke, parents held-up the contestants as examples to their children of what they ought to aspire to intellectually. Afterwards, no one wanted their kids to pattern themselves after people so corrupted in moral ambiguity.Interestingly, there was nothing illegal about giving the quiz contestants the answers, so long as the shows' sponsors knew about it beforehand (otherwise this would have constituted fraud.) But when the shows' staffs and contestants lied under oath about the quiz rigging, they became guilty of perjury, a Federal offense given the circumstances. The deception was bad enough. Lying about it afterwards only made the situation that much worse.The story of the quiz scandals should serve as a wake-up call to people who nostalgically yearn for the era and tend to think of the 1950s as the time of shark-finned cars, suburban tracts and Happy Days icons and music.

It pointed out that we must be careful not to glorify trivia, and that in fact those who dwell on it too much are losers.  I consider myself a trivia expert in many categories, and I and many people enjoy trivia a lot, but we are reminded to look elsewhere (like writing movie reviews, I guess).  The high water marks of Quiz Show project an apotheosis of trivia, trivia for trivia's sake, needing nothing else.  Obviously, this raises questions of values, and substance.  Remember that other accomplishments in life, life's basics, are more important.

Well we had to do an essay on the movie and i thought wouldn't it be cool to put it on IMDB.com, so here i go    In the 1950's television was new and the shows where good but you never saw it really effect people in anyway.  That was true untill games shows from radio came like Twenty-One and 64,000 Question.  In these shows you can see real people winning money and it's effecting their lives.  When watching the show you see people like yourself answer questions that they might not know, and you never knew who was gonna win.  That is why quiz shows where popular in the 1950's.    Then in the 1950's the people found-out of a scandal.  When a show like Twenty-One was giving the answer to contestants on their shows so they could have reoccurring contestants.  The people's vision of real people of the street was ask questions to see what THEY know, and not just to see reoccurring contestants.  They were lied to, and they did not want that.  In the outcome, game shows weren't watched.    One big argument of the show is that some people think that NBC who showed Twenty-One and Gertiol who sponsor the show should've got punished.  Since the manager of the show said that he never told either NBC and Gertiol of the answer giving, they weren't.  Personally i don't know what to think, Gertiol i don't care about, but NBC i do.  They bring us great shows like Saturday Night Live, Friends, Just Shoot Me, etc.. and they might not be if it wasn't for NBC.  But then on the other hand NBC was running this show and should know of everything that was going on, so in which I can't decide!    Now, after awhile that game shows where still going on, but not a real popular hours, they made a come back to primetime.  Shows like Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?, Survior, and Greed became hits, because now shows know not to lie to the public, or at less we hope they do.  Even the show Twenty-One made a come back, but i never left the ground.    It depends on your viewing public for trust.  Now there are shows that we know aren't real, but they are still hits.  Shows like The Jerry Springer Show (talk show) and WWF (wrestling) we know are fake and staged because they told us, and people still watch it because it's what they like.  The there are shows like Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and The Rickie Lake Show are shows that the viewing public wants and believes are real.

It is preachy, to be sure -- but pedantry isn't necessarily  a bad thing, provided the filmmaker has something worthwhile to preach about, and  carries it off with commitment and insight.Robert Redford did have something to bring to our attention in this film, and it was  not as many have suggested, the corruption of TV executives. It was also not fundamentally about dishonesty or fraud. The film's real purpose was to mark that  place in time in American culture when TV became more important then reality, when  it began to stand in for many of our higher values.Watch the film with this idea in mind, and it will take on a great deal more depth.  Observe the relationship between Charlie Van Doren and his father -- the two standing ultimately on different sides of the cultural divide that was opening in  American at that time. The side onto which Charlie Van Doren stepped, seduced by  money and easy fame, is the one on which we live on today. Our culture was not  always thus, is Redford's subtle message -- and here is when it changed. Bravo.Redford is also to be commended for the performances he drew from his cast. The  stand-outs are obvious, but what's important overall is Redford's attention to  character development and realism. This is something the current crop of hot-shot  directors (Soderburg, Cameron, Spielberg, Scott, to name but a few) cannot seem to  manage, so instead they give us visual spectacle, shallow characters and few ideas.  Perhaps it takes a senior member of the acting community rescue us from these  vapid directors.Quiz Show is one of the few movies of recent years to be a film about something  important, and it was executed with an unusual degree of wit, style and attention to  detail. This film will always reside near the top of my personal favorites list. I rate it  nine out of ten.

Based on a true story and firmly directed by Robert Redford.The backbone is entertainment in a historic perspective. Luckily, Redford and the superb cast allow for realistic tinges of despair and downright meanness to surface among some of the unfortunate Hollywood parading that somewhat bogs the movie.David Paymer and Hank Azaria - as media piranhas Dan Enright and Albert Freedman - are particularly annoying in their hysteric characters. Redford goes for a touch of the Coen brothers here - Paymer and Azaria do a truly smashing job - it just doesn't work in this context.There are exceptional and formidable performances all the way round. Most of them work. Lead by two major performances Ralph Fiennes and John Turturro.Fiennes seems to find the same venom deep in himself that made his performance the year before - as the sadistic German commandant in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) - a tentative stand out. He was both compelling, original and darkly seductive. This time he seems to turn that very same venom upon himself as he carefully embodies college professor Charles Van Doren. An educated man who is tempted and ultimately lured by the promise of money and fame on the game shows made for the revolutionary television.Fiennes' Van Doren is intelligent and wise, but nervous and disillusioned when among his peers - those are namely his father and other intellectuals - and he has even adapted a slight stutter that plays ingeniously well with his facial expressions and quirkiness. His performance is scintillating brilliant.Opposite him is John Turturro in what may be his finest performance to date. Turturro is Herb Stempel - the former game show winner who is found to be too geeky and greedy (and Jewish) for the network and therefore scheduled to take a fall - and he has never been better.He gives the term sore loser a whole new meaning.Turturro is always intriguing but has also become somewhat predictable. He is mainly used in eccentric and frenzied roles simply because of his onscreen magnetism (as in The Big Lebowski). Only Barton Fink (1991) hinted at the more shaded and jaded side of Turturro; one that showed us glimpses of emotional understanding from underneath that charismatic and provocative shield. That is visible here although Stempel basically whimpers and whines throughout the movie Why must he take a step aside for Van Doren? Why? Why? It is hilarious all the same.Yet it is with his wife and child at home that we glimpse the sensitive side of Herb Stempel as portrayed by John Turturro. A man who is to be respected for his intelligence, sure, but also for his commitment to family and honesty. After all.Furthermore both Paul Scofield as the elder Van Doren (Your name is my name!, he protests after learning that his son was aware of the scam the father-and-son scene is simply mesmerizing) and Rob Morrow as investigator Dick Goodwin deliver high caliber performances.Where do all these powerful performances leave the movie itself? On solid ground actually. The movie is taut and tight in form - interesting not only because of the morals at stake here - but because Redford treats the material like a murder mystery with Van Doren at center, caught in an emotional tight rope (to tell or not to tell?).Redford peels layer after layer off of Van Doren and his slow psychological disintegration has you pinned to your seat.The moral seems to be that amidst lost idealism we must rise again. Simple awareness of the gradual and ever-changing assessment of moral justification that resides in society today can help us make the many temptations - in what was already then considered a consumer-land - go away. Or can it?Along the way we are treated to some unfortunate candy-coated moments though. When Van Doren caves in and issues an amendment at a hearing he is at first applauded. Only to be sucker-punched by sheer Hollywoodism. A senator adds An adult should simply not be commended for telling the truth.As if the senator was expecting the audience - not at the hearing, but you dear viewer - to applaud him. These self-conscious John Wayne values do not fit the movie. Not when so bombastically dropped.All in all Redford delivers no answers - this is entertainment based on reality - but he is knowledgeable about human nature. When he brings that out in the open - by way of Paul Attanasio`s razor sharp screenplay and the amazing cast with Fiennes and Turturro in front  - Quiz Show is intelligent and alluring cinema.

There are a few clear instances of right and wrong, but only in the details, never in the big picture. After all, this was just television. Is it wrong for a game show to be produced in the same way as professional wrestling? Who were the victims? Can you describe them in a way which makes it clear the the quiz show was the perpetrator and not just an innocent bystander?What these questions show us is that the true subject of this movie is not just the tainted quiz shows, but all of the changes happening in society at that time. This involves the very structures of society, and goes beyond obvious allegories like television vs. the movies or the loss of innocence in the media. To make matters more interesting, the ways in which class, culture, and ethnicity all play a factor in how one reacts to these changes are an important part of the story. What the movie is depicting is the inevitable and permanent passing of the lifestyle which we associate with the 1950s and, like the morality of the characters in the movie, it is left to the viewer to decide whether or not this is a good or bad thing, or maybe a little of both.

The movie begins in 1958; the show '21' is on the top of its ratings. Their current champ, Herbert Stempel (John Turturro) seems to have great memory and a broad range of knowledge on many topics. John Turturro has always been an underrated actor, and his role as Stempbel is one of his best roles. He's able to make the audience sweat it out and think that he is really playing the game straight. He's also a pudgy loudmouth with a grating aspergery weirdness personality. We, the audience will never know who he is. The show's producers created the image of a nebbishy, awkward square in order to first make home audiences sympathize with him, and then root against him. So John Turturro is able to make him look like a quiet nerd, while also a loudmouth. The producers got tired of him, and wanted somebody more cleared cut, handsome, and somebody the audience can appeal to. What the audience doesn't know is that the show is rigged and the winners are fed the answers. Herbert is encouraged to take a dive and allow Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes), a handsome and charming college professor, to become the show's new champion. Ralph gives the character, the American aristocrat feel to him. Like Stempel, we don't know truly how Charles Van Doren acted. Ralph is able to show Charles Van Doren bad acting with furrowed brow agonizing, while also showing what could have been Van Doren real self. Congressional investigator Richard Goodwin (Rob Morrow) can see through the lies and began to snoop to takes him to Stempel, who claims the show's producers ordered him to lose to Doren. Morrow is emotionally drawn to Van Doren, as he invites Morrow to many of his social circle of Ivy League WASPs. He still wants to bring the TV industry and its corporate sponsors to its knees, but Doren is in danger of getting expose. He's torn between his newfound friendship with Doran and his quest for the truth. Director Robert Redford and writer Paul Attanasio paint a telling portrait of how the network heads and advertising men who manipulated the quiz shows were also able to manipulate the responsibility for the scandal away from themselves. It has a 'All the President's Men' to it with Morrow as the intrepid investigator, is a detective story full of familiar Watergate patterns the late-night poring over lists of potential sources, the confrontations with tight-lipped witnesses at their front doors, the publicly inaccessible authority that needs toppling. However, the movie doesn't end with a clear answer. There is a sympathetic Hollywood spin on the real counterpart. In a film that takes exception to deception (or dramatic manipulation) in the name of entertainment, it's more than a little ironic that Quiz Show&#x97;as enjoyable as it is&#x97;pulls the same kind of wool over your eyes. The irony is that the producers were trying to create as much drama as possible for the audience. It mirrors the real life show. You never know what truly happen.

When one contestant (John Turturro) is ousted by another (Ralph Fiennes), the first whistle-blows on what really goes on behind the scenes.  It is not pleasant.  It turns out that there is corruption through and through the show from its producers all the way down to the host himself.

His attempt to change the system hardly affects the quiz show business at all as they are still rampant today.  What is the point of Redford's film?  It is complicated in one sense but very simple in another.  In one area it shows that the most innocent looking things in life can be altered to create profits for those in charge.  However, it also shows that the dirtiest of things can still survive due to their popularity (regardless of their poor elements).

In the annals of great events of the twentieth century, the quiz show scandals of the late fifties would rank pretty low even then, and less so today. Why? I'm not sure. Perhaps because so many entertainments today are blatantly phony, it's hard to get very worked up about a rigged TV program from fifty years ago. Pro wrestling is the obvious example, but there is the whole phenomenon of 'reality' television that, while perhaps not technically 'rigged,' is so overblown in its self-importance as to feel unnervingly fake to most discerning people. But then, that shouldn't really matter, should it? Movies don't have to be about big subjects. Certainly some of the very best have been about small or intimate themes. And 'Quiz Show' does a good job of telling its story, large, small or in-between. It has a nice feel of time and place, though it doesn't portray the fifties as convincingly as some other films have. I think this has more to do with the dialogue than set decorations or any other visual element. It seems a bit too knowing, too obviously written from a current perspective, especially from the show-in-question's two producers, which seem right out of present day. Maybe Redford is making a point some things never change. Part of the fun of 'Quiz Show' is identifying the various actors. None are megastars but a lot of them are familiar and I found myself saying, there's Griffin Dunne, there's the guy from 'Ed Wood' and there's the chief of staff from 'Air Force One', etc. I suppose that is not unusual except that there are so many of them in 'Quiz Show;' it seems a mini who's who of working actors. Oh, and Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren. He's certainly photogenic and is meant to project the shy, somewhat self-deprecating intelligence of the real Van Doren as well as his tortured conscience. The self-deprecation though is largely a pose as the character is really quite full of himself. Fiennes' performance is adequate, but he smiles too much. You begin to wonder if he has any other expression than smiling winsomely at whomever he's speaking to. The story, as well as the truth behind it, is simple enough. A Jeopardy-type program in the late 50's, 'Twenty-One,' supplies Van Doren with answers for some of the questions (as it had for the preceding champion, whose popularity had 'plateaued'), thus ensuring Van Doren wins every time and remains on the air. A federal investigator learns the truth and eventually Van Doren confesses in a hearing. It was a big deal at the time, giving impetus to the quiz shows being 'cleaned up.' (How 1950's is that? First horror comic books, then quiz shows.) Looking at it today though, it's strictly gossip column fodder, right up there with did the Monkees play their own instruments? Charles Van Doren's father, who was a rather famous professor and intellectual in his own right, considers the programs hardly worthy of contempt, and that cheating on them was roughly equivalent to plagiarizing comic books. Then at the end, Twenty-One's producers further make the argument that the hearings are a big to-do over nothing. According to one, the sponsor makes money, the network makes money, the contestants make money, and the public is entertained. So, he asks, who is hurt? I find it hard to argue his point. There is a charm in the naiveté' of past decades, yet at times one is inclined to shake one's head and think, those people had WAY too much time on their hands. For all its well-informed nostalgia, 'Quiz Show' seems a perfect example of that.

When the ratings for the quiz show 21 begin to stagnate during reigning champion Herbert Stempel's tenure, the sponsors decide they want a new contestant. But Stempel appears to be unbeatable. Then the producers meet little known literary professor Charles Van Doren. Doren appears to exude an uncommon combination of intelligence, knowledge, and amiability. And he's of gentile extraction, probably Dutch-New England, unlike the Jewish Stempel who probably grew up in Brooklyn. However, it's not enough they want to match Van Doren against Stempel. They want to make sure Stempel loses, so they compel him to flub an easy question, the Best Picture of 1955, Marty. Only problem is, Marty is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture. The producer, Daniel Enright, replies that that's the beauty of it. It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic.In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee. He is wondering if the television quiz shows are legitimate, or fudging their own supposed rules. He begins asking questions. He is led to Herbert Stempel and eventually to Charles Van Doren, the recent 21 champion. Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged.An incredible film with a first-rate cast. Quiz Show presents not just the scandal itself, but a slice of American culture in the late 1950's. Although World War II was now over 10 years behind, new challenges were facing America. And the legitimacy of television as the new entertainment medium was becoming the choice for many Americans. The public believed everything they saw, but not everything they saw was real.

He was told to answer the first two parts the paper was the Emporia (Kansas) Gazette, the editor was William Allen White; then he would blank on the name of the editorial What's The Matter With Kansas? Ironically, his history class at CCNY had talked about the editorial just a few days earlier.Rob Morrow is actually, as far as I'm concerned, the worst actor in the movie. He can't make up his mind if he should adopt a Kennedyesque accent or sound like Peter Falk as Columbo.Finally, although Charles Van Doren wrote an article about Twenty-One in 2008, the first he'd said publicly about it since the hearings in 1959, he added nothing new. On the other hand, this movie brought Herb Stempel back into the spotlight and, despite what he did, I think the public now looks on him as the good guy in his encounters with Van Doren. And by the way, he doesn't look nearly as nerdy as he looked when he appeared on the show or as John Turturro played him; Dan Enright was trying to create the image of a nerd and Robert Redford obviously followed suit for authenticity's sake.

After that, director Robert Redford's innate taste as a filmmaker tends to slow the pacing down, so that nothing which takes place seems very exciting. Redford (whose apparent love for this era is rather surprising) makes excellent casting choices and his conception of the story, a flashback-in-time, is stylish and serious-minded (no overt nostalgia). However, the picture's second-half gets bogged down in legalities which are far less intriguing than the behind-the-scenes drama.

Quiz Show movie was shown to the public in 1994. It dramatizes about the scandals in the show Twenty One because there was discrimination with Herbert Stemple who was a humble and smart person (nerd). In the Twenty One game, Herbert was playing with an opponent. In that game the host was Jack Barry who asked the questions to the contestants. They played for points, so the person who scored highest won the game. In that game Herbert won $64,000 dollars and after that he was still winning various games.The producers, who were Dan Enright and Albert Freedman, were seeing that the program didn't show the ratings that they wanted, so they expected that was for the nerdy guy who had a poor appearance. So Dan Enright and Albert Freedman contacted Van Doren, who was handsome with a good appearance, and was a college professor in the Columbia University. The producers met with him before the show to tell him that they were going to give him the answers because they wanted him to be the protagonist for all the shows. At the same time they talked to Herbert to tell him that if he lost the game they are going to put him in another show. So they played. When Barry asked him the last question and Herbert knew it, but he missed the answer and obviously Van Doren won.Van Doren was winning a lot of shows and making a lot of money in the easy way called FRAUD. Then appeared Dick Goodwin, who was an idealistic Congressional lawyer, and he got access to Van Doren. He was visiting him for several times and Goodwin started to suspect about why Van Doren was wining all the quiz shows. After that Barry was investigated in anywhere to try the proof that the Twenty One show was a fraud. Then Van Doren was tired about that he was doing and in the next show he told the producers that he didn't want to win with their help because it was to be a scandal for him and his family. So he lost the next game. Van Doren went to talk with his father and he was disappointment because his son was embarrassed his family with that fraud. So, Van Doren was embarrassed and he decided to say the truth in the committee meeting in Washington because he thought that is better for the people felt that he had deceived them. Yet he felt peace inside himself, and the producers were fired for the fraud. The Twenty One show was canceled.In my opinion, I didn't like the end of the movie because the law didn't work well because nobody went to the jail. If the people do a fraud they have to go to jail because they were wrong. In the movie Van Doren just said, I made a mistake and that's all. And he walked way like he didn't do anything.In conclusion, sometimes the people don't make the money, the money makes the people "},{"Title":"Good But Overrated","Date":"30 March 2008","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" I remember seeing this many moons ago.

In one fell swoop nearly all the television quiz shows went off the air. For a long time the only ones you saw on television were Concentration, Password, and The Price is Right and none of them were for the big money that 21 and others were giving out.Poor Charles Van Doren he was just ahead of his time without knowing it. Today a guy like Herbert Stempel would never make it through the screening process. But he did back in the day and therein lies the tale.I remember it well from my childhood. Herbert Stempel, nerdy ex-GI who probably was a Democrat who voted for Ike just ain't cutting it on the Nielsen ratings. They need someone with glamor and when Charles Van Doren, scion of one of America's most glittering family of intellectuals and folks who were definitely madly for Adlai tries out for one of the Barry-Enright Quiz Shows, they think they've found their star. Stempel gets promised all kinds of stuff to throw the show, but his promises are welshed on. That does not sit too well with Stempel who starts protesting loud and long to the Grand Jury in New York County and finally to the Halls of Congress. Van Doren and his family are disgraced.I remember the attention given to the real Charles Van Doren. A matinée idol professor, he looked to have a golden future. I could have easily seen him running for public office at some point had the scandal never occurred.John Turturro as Stempel and Ralph Fiennes as Van Doren ring true to their characters, especially Fiennes as I remember Van Doren.

The idea is that powerful people can use technology selfishly to manipulate mass human behavior. And so, Redford's Quiz Show gives us a real life example of McLuhan's insight by showing how, in the 1950s, corporate TV sponsors sought to increase the number of viewers by rigging game shows. The boob tube was the medium used to transmit bogus entertainment that camouflaged the real message, namely that TV sponsors used deception to attract a larger audience, thereby increasing product sales potential. McLuhan's insight was, and still is ... potent.In no uncertain terms, Redford's film renders a scathing indictment of television entertainment in the 1950s. What shocked me was the extent of viewer gullibility in those days. But the film's story is relevant now because it shows that today's unethical TV programming has a historic precedent. Current game shows may not be rigged. But, the lack of ethics has invaded shows that are more important, like news and current events, with gullible viewers assuming that what they see and hear represents the absolute truth with no hidden agenda.While the film's theme is potent, its cinematic package is less so. For one thing, the film is too long. Some scenes could have been edited out, especially home life of the main characters, and the film's first three minutes.Casting and performances are generally good. I especially liked Paul Scofield as the erudite professor. And Allan Rich was perfect as executive Robert Kintner. But Rob Morrow's Boston accent seemed unnatural and forced. And some of the main characters were annoying, like Herb Stempel, Dan Enright, and Al Freedman. The film's production design was impressively lavish, almost to the point of looking too slick. Cinematography was acceptable, but for such a big budget film I could have wished for more photographic pizazz.Quiz Show is best considered as a cinematic study of a culturally significant set of historic events. One should remember, however, that film is a medium, too. If the viewer keeps in mind that this film is an interpretation of history, not history itself, then he or she will be more discerning, and be less prone to gullibility.

The movie has a lot to say about image perception and prejudice; poor John Turturro, who plays a homely Jewish character, is bumped off the quiz program and replaced by handsome Protestant boy Ralph Fiennes.  The nature of intellectualism and entertainment is another area of focus - do we watch quiz programs because we like smart people, or because we like suspense and high money stakes?Despite these great concepts, and wonderful performances from all concerned (especially Paul Scofield), Quiz Show is missing a little something - dare I call it pep?  The film is oh-so-slightly slow.  And it tends to raise more questions than it answers, which is of course perfectly legitimate, but it can leave viewers frustrated.  Quiz Show makes American society look pretty damn shallow and obnoxious - advertisers and showmen are in complete control here.  And that's rather depressing.  The movie doesn't go very far beyond pointing out such harsh realities, but then again, maybe there's nowhere left for it to go.

That's the way I feel watching Quiz Show.As a depiction of the famous 1950s scandal that revealed contestants of the NBC quiz show 21 were being fed answers, Quiz Show brims with pretentious portentousness, from the opening scene where a car radio is switched on just as a report about the new Sputnik satellite is broadcast (an excuse for someone to actually say All is not well with America) to the end credits where we hear a way overwrought performance of Mack The Knife.Many of the acting performances are very good, especially Ralph Fiennes as Charles Van Doren, the golden boy of 21 whose erudition is enhanced by pre-show prepping; Paul Scofield as his proud father Mark, who travels the lofty circles of intellectual society with admirable rectitude and the privilege of not having to worry about how to earn a living; and David Paymer as Dan Enright, the producer of 21 who justifies his shell game by talking about how his program advances the cause of education.There are some terrific scenes in Quiz Show, most involving two of the three actors mentioned above, like when Enright first broaches the idea of feeding a shocked Charles the answers to the questions, and a gorgeously shot picnic at the Van Doren home in Cornwall, Connecticut, where the extended Van Doren clan throws obscure Shakespeare quotations at one another, basking in the beauty of their Updike lifestyle. Director Robert Redford displays an engaging subtlety in these and some other moments that reminds you why people were so impressed when he made Ordinary People.But there's a reason why Redford made that instead of The Chosen, which becomes clear with his depiction of the film's Jewish characters. They are actually caricatures, and central to the story as the script puts a lot of weight on their distance from the aristocratic Van Dorens. One caricature, the jealous low-class Herbie Stempel played by John Turturro, rails about his intellectual prowess and the fact he was forced to take a dive as 21's top contestant for Van Moron. More obnoxious still is the assimilated caricature of Richard Goodwin, a congressional investigator of quiz-show corruption as played by Rob Morrow, so pushy he feels the need to tell even the guy selling him a car that he was first in his class in Harvard.When Goodwin hesitates to put Charles on the stand, his wife, an obnoxious caricature herself played by Mira Sorvino, accuses him of being an Uncle Tom of the Jews. Actually, it seems an odd moment of understandable mercy from Goodwin, who otherwise ruins lives to improve his own in such a way its no surprise he wound up working for Bobby Kennedy.The Jewish issue keeps coming up, in the most heavy-handed contexts. When Goodwin tells Van Doren about being first in his class, Van Doren says he's surprised Goodwin doesn't wear it as a tattoo. Shuttered in a glass booth, Stempel wonders when they will drop the cyanide in. I almost wonder what kept 21 host Jack Berry (Christopher McDonald does a nice job with the role) from pressing Stempel with Is that your final solution?It's just a quiz show, folks. Like Enright's assistant (Hank Azaria) tells the committee in the last lines of the film We're not exactly hardened criminals here. We're in show business. That Van Doren and others played fast and loose with the public trust is a matter for their own consciences, and hardly merited government interference. Because they were the only victims of their own crimes, the movie seems to implicate NBC and sponsor Geritol of the ultimate crime; frankly I see Goodwin as more blameworthy.Maybe Redford did, too, which is why Morrow comes off so obnoxiously in his film. But such divided loyalties do not help bring off a complicated story that is already overlong, nor explain why it is we are supposed to feel so sorry at the end for Van Doren and not Stempel. Is it simply because Stempel has bad teeth and a sidewall haircut? Or because Van Doren's ancestors came off the Mayflower rather than Ellis Island?Even when Quiz Show questions such elitism, it doesn't really puncture it, nor does the film explain why I should be so up in arms about what went on here. I just see a group of people on different power trips colliding into each other, and while it makes for some nice fireworks, it doesn't leave much to chew on.

Watching this ten years ago, I thought the characterization was pat but not subversive, but based on this viewing I've changed my mind. What I find loathsome is how far the filmmakers would go to contrast the Jewish Stempel with the WASPy van Doren, to the point of completely dehumanizing the former. It may be true that the real Stempel possessed all those physical and verbal tics that the director burdens him with, but Torturro does not (or is not allowed to) imbue the character with an ounce of quiet dignity in the way Fiennes so obviously does, and that upset me. In the eyes of Goodwin, the protagonist, and therefore in our eyes, Stempel's sole character trait is his jewishness. As stereotypes go, this may be the worst kind, a well-meaning one that seeks to illustrate a big truth at the expense of small truth. Overall the acting was just OK, and Ray Fiennes' crucial performance leaves one cold, although Hank Azaria and Paul Scofield were very good in smaller roles. What this film exposes, yet again, is the toxicity of a certain kind of liberalism, dutifully espoused by Redford. In his heart, he wants nothing more than to be a van Doren, nothing less than to be a Stempel. In his wide-eyed buildup to the scene at the van Doren estate in Connecticut, where all those liberal lions gather, Redford is like a southern belle pining for the good old days; he likes things the way they were, and sees past (or rather embraces) the aloof ruthlessness with which they dismiss everything but their little games. Love for fellow man has been bred out of them along with all but the blue pigment out of their irises.

Now, in the light of day, far removed from the white noise of vacant critical praise, it isn't really all that great. In fact, on a writing level I think it's kind of silly.I was distracted by the contrivance that Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow) and Van Doren (Feinnes) would bond so rapidly, particularly while Goodwin is investigating possible corruption behind the scenes of 21 (you would think that would put a damper on their relationship). One minute Goodwin is introducing himself to Van Doren as an investigator, the next minute Goodwin is playing Name-That-Shakespeare-Line at a Van Doren family birthday party, and sharing a late night game of poker with Van Doren and his pals. That poker scene, by the way, was another writer's contrivance a forced opportunity for Goodwin to literally call Van Doren's bluff, while he's also figuratively calling his bluff in the story at large. It's way on the nose.In any event, did Goodwin and Van Doren really have to become fast friends in order to tell this story? I don't think so. The script is also so desperate to prove how literate it is. I already mentioned the Shakespeare game played at the birthday party -- a good two minutes of the film consumed by preppy New Englanders quoting the Bard randomly, if you get off on that sort of thing. Also, for some reason, at the conclusion of his first meeting with Van Doren, Goodwin (Morrow) stands up, smiles, and exits the office while quoting Ode to a Grecian Urn. For a second I thought I dreamed that part, but it was really there. I'm still trying to figure out what Ode to a Grecian Urn had to do with the scene that preceded it, or the movie in general.Finally, Rob Morrow's accent just awful.Most of the acting in this one is actually pretty good, and the movie LOOKED great.

"},{"Title":"Quiz Show","Date":"15 September 2005","Score":"0 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" I saw this film once before when I was in college, but for some reason I didn't finish it, so I watched it a second time all the way through, not remembering anything, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Robert Redford (The Horse Whisperer, The Legend of Bagger Vance). Based on the true story, set in 1958, television game shows were a big draw for audiences in America, and popular prime time show Twenty One was one of them, it involved contestants answering adjudicated questions concealed in a sealed envelope for host Jack Barry (Christopher McDonald) to read, and the first to correctly answer gaining twenty one points wins the game. The reigning champion, undefeated and a large cash prize remaining, is Herbert 'Herbie' Stempel (Transformers' Golden Globe nominated John Turturro), but the creators of the show see audience numbers slightly dwindling, so they think a new talent should be found. Producers Dan Enright (Mighty Joe Young's David Paymer) and Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) find their new contestant at Columbia University, instructor Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) who has a very good knowledge of many things, and is the son of respected intellectual and renowned poet Mark Van Doren (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Paul Scofield). Stempel is told by the Twenty One creators that he will answer the question what film won the 1955 Oscar for Best Picture (correct answer Marty, chosen incorrect answer On the Waterfront) incorrectly on purpose, he agrees as long as he is allowed to stay on television. So when it comes to the broadcast, where Stempel faces Van Doren, he hesitates on giving the correct answer, but he goes with the wrong answer, allowing his opponent to become the new champion. Of course his success continues week after week on the show, and with his charming good nature, great knowledge and everyman qualities he grows into a national celebrity, going on the covers of Time and Life magazines. Stempel meanwhile has lost all his prize winnings to a dodgy bookie and needs help, and he threatens to reveal the truth that both he and Van Doren, and many contestants in the past, have been given the correct answers deliberately by the NBC network, this is of course true, they did rig the show to increase ratings. Young Dick Goodwin (The Bucket List's Rob Morrow), Congressional lawyer from Harvard Law, has come to New York to investigate the rumours and accusations of the quiz shows, visiting many of the contestants who appeared on Twenty One, including of course Van Doren, who denies anything and is liked by Goodwin, and Stempel, who opens up and confirms everything, and indeed fixing comes to light. With evidence mounting and the show trying to continue unaffected, Van Doren decides to get a question wrong on purpose, but he is given an NBC contract to appear on the Today show, while Goodwin starts the ball rolling for a court case. After Van Doren gives his statement that the show he appeared is honest, Stempel testifies and confesses to his part in the conspiracy, and so eventually does Van Doren, and in the end the scandal is confirmed, the sponsors are removed, and the networks do get some form of punishment. Also starring Johann Carlo as Toby Stempel, Elizabeth Wilson as Dorothy Van Doren, Allan Rich as Robert Kintner, Romy and Michele's High School Reunion's Mira Sorvino as Sandra Goodwin, GoodFellas director Martin Scorsese as sponsor Martin Rittenhome, Rain Man director Barry Levinson as Dave Garroway, Ally McBeal's Calista Flockhart as Barnard Girls, William Fichtner as Stage Manager and Ethan Hawke as Don Quixote Student. I always thought that this was a satirical film not based on fact, but it is good to know that a scam like this was real, I also thought Fiennes was the star, and indeed he makes a good impression, but he is equally matched by the slightly nerdy but likable Turturro character, and director Redford makes this story very intriguing, a likable true story drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Ralph Fiennes was number 83 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 28 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!

An excellent production in general with the feel of a theatrical docudrama, the film does a good job of showing the nebulous nature of corruption; the blurring of good and evil, the compromising of moral precepts, the whistle blowing, the covering up, the rationalizations, and the rest of the dialectic which all such scandals seem to follow. (eg Watergate, The Insider, Erin Brocovich, etc.) Quiz Show has no clear winners with the exception of the audience. Its slightly obvious presentation makes it an enjoyable watch for all.

Is he trying to ruin the lives of people or sully their memories at the expense of their surviving family memories families. Like JFK before it, I can only hope that those who watch this movie will seek the truth. It is not in this movie. Charles Van Doren was not getting back at his father. His father was a wonderful, not boring, professor at Columbia. The Geritol marketing director played by Scorsesee (sp?) was not aware of the fraud. And neither Van Doren nor Stemple lived the lives stated at the end of the movie--apparently to give it a dour ending. Redford commits the atrocities of money and capitalism that he said he was targeting. Redford, the fake mountain man, grew up in Santa Monica and is just another Hollywood virtue monger who should examine his own virtues before speaking about (er, fabricating) the lives and virtues of others.I will admit that when I first saw this movie, I thought it very good, but after seeking the truth, I cannot in good faith give it more than one star. I will not recommend movies that criminalize innocent men and besmirch admired professionals without evidence.If you are interested, there is a Hollywood history of such Constitutionally protected atrocities. You should also search out the truth about the wife of William Randolph Hearst portrayed as a worthless woman in Citizen Kane. She was a worthless woman and she was living and crushed by the movie. Hollywood blames Hearst for killing this great movie, but if he did it to protect this woman, he is to be admired. Just because it is protected by the constitution doesn't make it right.

The plot could have been a little more intriguing, meaning the core of the plot was divulged to the viewer earlier on in the film. I would have liked to have had some suspense, or surprises interwoven into the plot.Redford in my opinion has proved himself as an accomplished director in his own right over the years. I have no problem with his ability to direct, though I thought the screenplay could have been better, something Redford could have worked with to make it memorable. The actors were all capable and some were very impressive with their characterisations, though this doesn't save the film (for me anyway).The underlying aspects were dealt with extremely well. I was trying to imagine myself as a contestant and wonder how I would cope with the situation placed upon me like it was with the character; Charles Van Doren. I suppose there comes a time in everyone's life where the struggle between right and wrong is a constant battle to a certain degree, given the situation. The final overview I have is it is so difficult to question one's own judgment and integrity while being tempted by either money, fame or acceptance.Truly, I have to be honest.....I watched it (or should I say, I came back to it 3 times) I literally forced myself to finish watching it. I give it a 6/10.

I kept waiting for tension to build, but the movie was more concerned with talking about actions than showing them.  The movie was predictable, had flat characters, and was not involving to the viewer.On the plus side, we see Hank Azaria in a different kind of role than his regular selections.5/10 "}]
