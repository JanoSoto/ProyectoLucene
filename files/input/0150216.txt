[{"Title":"fascinating slice of history","Date":"10 July 2000","Score":"49 out of 56 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  Although ultraconservatives will undoubtedly dismiss `The Cradle Will Rock' as blatant leftwing propaganda, the rest of us will see it as a fascinating rumination on the intricate relationship that has always existed between politics and art.  Writer/director Tim Robbins, whose left-leaning sympathies are common knowledge in the film industry, has managed to create a screenplay of amazing complexity and depth, functioning on an enormous number of levels - political, historical, aesthetic, personal - without ever losing clarity and focus.  He has set up a dizzying array of characters, yet each one is fleshed out with enough depth and particularity to make him or her a vital part of the overall tapestry.Set in the turbulent 1930's, Robbins' tale focuses on the National Theatre Company, an organization set up by Roosevelt during the Depression to provide out-of-work artists a vehicle through which to ply their trade and culture-starved audiences a chance to revel in the glories of live theatrical performances.  Unfortunately, it was also a time of great civil and political upheaval, with Communism and Fascism battling for supremacy abroad and many Americans divided along similar lines in their loyalties. With passions running deep, it was only a matter of time before many in the United States Congress began suspecting the NTC of Communist sympathizing - and it was a short road from there to the eventual dismemberment of the organization.  The film centers on the production of a controversial musical play called `The Cradle Will Rock' that portrays the glorious coming of unionism to a steel factory, a scenario that parallels the events in the lives of several of the characters in the film.Given this fascinating historical background, Robbins has filled his film with a rich assortment of characters, from Orson Welles, as a fledgling young actor who sees unions as the ruination of artistic purity, to Nelson Rockefeller, as a well-meaning art patron who balks at the mural Diego Rivera has painted for him only after Rivera refuses to remove the image of Lenin from Rockefeller's monument-to-capitalism lobby.  In fact, the cast of characters is so enormous, with each one taking a crucial part in the narrative proceedings, that it is quite impossible to mention them all here. Suffice it to say that Robbins covers the social spectrum from industrialists and capitalists to union workers and the unemployed, from sympathetic patrons and patronesses to the little people eager to root out the seeds of Communism even at the expense of their own ostracism.  And not a one is uninteresting.Robbins has assembled an all-star cast that reads like a who's who of contemporary movie acting (albeit of a non-blockbuster variety). Although at the beginning of the film, the casting of such familiar faces seems a bit disconcerting - leading to what critic Judith Crist refers to as the `hey there' syndrome, i.e. destroying the verisimilitude of a work by parading too many recognizable people before the camera - this technique actually helps the audience to differentiate the many characters who might otherwise pass by in a confusing and disorienting blur.  Hank Azaria, Ruben Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Cary Elwes, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, Susan Sarandon, John Turturro and Emily Watson comprise this truly fine cast.Liberal as his leanings might be, Robbins is able to focus on the bitter ironies that abound on both sides of the political spectrum.  For instance, while Susan Sarandon portrays a Jewish ally of Mussolini, abandoning her pro-worker principles to act as his capitalist representative in the States, Ruben Blades plays a Diego Rivera who has subordinated - if only temporarily - his own revolutionary ethos to the power of the almighty buck.  Also, there is a certain paradox to the fact that, when the government has decreed the theater closed and thereby forbidden the premiere performance of the play, it is the actors' UNION that threatens the performers with firing if they carry out their plan to stage it furtively.  Robbins is even somewhat evenhanded in his treatment of the `enemy' - the rich capitalists and the anti-communist members of the theatre organization - portraying them with good-natured humor and pathos.  Joan Cusack, as a clerk at the employment office and Bill Murray, as a vaudeville ventriloquist, seem like decent people, only hopelessly misguided and lonely.  (Unfortunately, Murray's sudden change of heart at the end seems inexplicable and unmotivated).  As for the elite in the story, Robbins does a lovely job of spoofery at the end of the film; as the play is finally being performed at a nearby theatre - representing the triumph both on stage and in the world at large of the common man over the oppressive tyrants of industry - the tycoons, dressed in masquerade ball costumes of the 18th Century aristocracy and Catholic hierarchy, mull over their plans to retain control of the art world by bankrolling only those paintings depicting the scenes of utmost blandness and banality.  Thus, these men of corporate power are portrayed more as amusingly quaint pests than malevolent or malicious despots.There is certainly no denying that `The Cradle Will Rock' is, at heart, a bit of a leftwing diatribe.  However, it is not a cruel or unreasonable one. And Tim Robbins' extraordinary skills as both a storyteller and filmmaker make this clearly one of the most interesting and impressive films of 1999.

Not great, but it is clear in his acting that he has a passion for the theater. Now he has written and directed something that elevates him to world class.The simple first Tim has learned from Altman how to make a camera move in such a way that the viewer becomes part of the action. Some of his long, multithreaded action shots are breathtaking. More, this is used to tie together dual threads and multiple stories. Altman again, but even Altman is inconsistent in this.But Tim can do something Altman cannot. He tunes this ensemble so tightly it seems that they are siblings. Many individual performances deeply charm, reach high.That alone makes this a must see. But there's more. This is yet another play about a play, a common enough genre that has a very specific set of pitfalls. Robbins the writer cleverly avoids this with a facile trick. Uncareful viewers will see this as a simple, left-leaning story about artistic McCarthyism (Jesse Helms anyone?). But that is a ruse. The story is just the excuse.Watch it again and look for why the play couldn't be put on. It was the unions, as much coopted by the system as Rockefeller that was the real threat and who the players defy at the end. This ahistorical fact was inserted for a reason. Also watch for how the whole thing is nested in Faust, with a deeper recursive level with the players as the puppets in Faust. The puppet thing is worked a few other ways with Murray of course, but also so many others until we feel that the only non-puppets are the actors.I think this is one of those cases where Robbins exceeded his own intellect, but it still works as a deeply recursive self examination, even of itself, because he trusted his instincts as dramatist (and presumably the actors' instincts as well).I rate this high for intelligence. It achieves what Altman has not. Some seem to object that some of the characters are silly Wells and Houseman and the Countess. But this is deliberate. They are playing players IN A PLAY. That's the point. Perhaps it would have been better to not use historical names since it confuses people who might look for accuracy.Some misgivings though. Sarandon's performance was the weakest. Cinematically, the crushing of the mural during the performance was blunt editing. The pacing was off -- it should have been better integrated with the pacing of the play's action. The transposition of the dummy to modern Broadway was radically less subtle than the dummy theme's life in the rest of the play. If you didn't tease it out early, you'd be confused.

Truly an exemplary take on the battle of radicals and corporates, art and politics when they could be united in a common bond. Thus, it is only suiting that such a film be directed by uber-liberalist Tim Robbins. This picture simply wouldn't have worked without him.From an overhead point of view, this is the cinematic equivalent of a protest- a real bite on shady politics. But in actuality it is something far deeper, focusing on numerous interesting sub-plots and taking in everyone's point of view. The backdrop is the closing down of a theatrical play when it is accused of being communist. Throughout the 135 minutes, we take in all of the different `isms'- fascism, capitalism, communism, Nazism, Catholicism and Judaism. Not only does this require a passing knowledge on these people and events; one must have an interest in the proceedings to get the most out of it.One reason why there have been some negative reviews is because people are confused as to why Diego Riviera, Margherreta Sarfatti etc. are in the story. I can explain. Rather like `Magnolia (which followed on totally dissimilar outlines), you have to read the sub-text. This is a movie about passion for art and music. Marc Blitzein, Hazel Huffman and Diego Riviera (and all connected) had a deep passion for their work that the authorities would soon destroy because of rules and regulations.Interesting is the fact that all the characters are based on true life people, and Robbins has assembled a fine cast who give noteworthy performances all across the board. One of the hardest to portray has to be Orson Welles. It's a true fact that 21-year-olds from the 1930's look much older than those from the 90's. No one wanted to see James Van Der Beek/ Casper Van Dien in the role. Thus, Angus MacFadyen was a superb choice, portraying Welles as an egotistical, self-centred man. Equally impressive is Susan Sarandon (with an impeccable exotic accent) as a Jewish Fascist art dealer.  She knows exactly what she's doing and highlights some of the best scenes. Other standouts include John Cusack's aristocratic Nelson Rockafeller and Cary Elwes' interpretation of flamboyant producer/ soon-to-be Oscar winner (`The Paper Chase'- 1973) John Houseman.If there were a flaw, it would have to be the last 15-20 minutes. What, for the most part, is an illustrious, brilliant character study later dissipates into a shiny-smiley low glitz `Singin In the Rain' effort. Such a shame, because the film was doing so tremendously up until that point. Then of course, it is 135 minutes long so much of that final sequence could and should have been excised.Nevertheless, if you can forgive that, you have a remarkable, audacious film on hand. `The Cradle Will Rock' truly is an overseen landmark in ensembles, biopics and interweaving. By far Robbins best movie yet, the sub-plots are equally impressive from Blitzstein's paranoid delusions to Constance La Grange's over-the-top characteristics. If you are in any way interested in fascism, communism etc. then don't miss this polished, spirited picture. My IMDb rating 7.6/10.

A film that stands up in the face of adversity and squashed freedom.Robbin's telling of the legendary events surrounding the Orson Welles production of Marc Blitztien's Labor Opers, THE CRADLE WILL ROCK, not only puts forth the events but he masterfully presents his film in the style of a Brecht theatre piece. The emotional level in the theatre when I saw this film was high,Applause rang out during the films climax. But this film is not only about artistic freedom, it is about freedom as a whole,about standing up for your freedom of belief and expression,could you imagine that there was actually a time in this free nation of ours when armed guards actually locked the doors of a theatre ,trying to prevent a show from being mounted.This film is an important one,and what Robbins accomplishes is  to present it as entertainment as well,this is not a history lesson but a well executed work of art. As perfomances go everyone was splendid. Hank Azaria wins best honors as Blitztien,Cary Elwes and Angus McFadden as Houseman and Welles are also brilliant in their stellar portrayals.Vanessa Redgrave,Susan Sarandon and Bill Murray also lend their imense talents. John Turrturo deserves special mention for his touching portrait of actor Howard DaSilva.  Some critics have pointed out what they felt was a lack of character development in the film. These critics have greatly missed the point. the film is presented as a Brecht (or Blitztein ) style play. Blitztein's CRADLE included characters named for their role in society,or personality, Jimmy Forman,Mister Mister,Reverend Salvation etc. it is this type of acting Robbins successfully evokes from his actors.  This film is more than a movie,it is an emotional experience that will change the way you look at society.It is an inspiration,telling us to fight for what you believe in.

They are Hollywood players, and as such, I do not always stand and cheer when I see one of their films. It's taken some time for me to recognize their excellent aspirations. Not to say I haven't embraced their intentions in a general way. With this film, Cradle Will Rock, however, I embrace them unconditionally.I have deep theatrical roots, and was simply enchanted by the frame of this story inside Roosevelt's WPA theatre project of the early '30s. As deeply embedded in the theatre as I am, I had no idea, I blush to admit, that I owed so much to the extraordinary legacy of the artists and managers from that era. So, for this alone, I am grateful to the filmmakers.Within my personal history in the theatre, I have long struggled with the zeal in needing to produce theatre in defense of civil and human liberties, and reconciling that with the ongoing pressures of making a buck. Not that I insist all artistic need be liberty oriented. But I am uneasy in choosing a work to produce or to witness, if I cannot find a pillar of social justice within it. The earth is far too fragile, and the threats to her and her inhabitants are far too imminent, to waste time otherwise.Back to the film Not only was I unaware of the WPA theatre project, I was unaware there was a McCarthy-Era-like-witch hunt to dismember the artists and producers and administrators. I kept thinking as I watched the Senate interrogations, Is that Senator McCarthy? That can't be--that doesn't happen for 30 years! The parallel is unmistakable (uncanny), and one can't help but ponder its legacy The McCarthy Era; Senator Jesse Helms' vicious, relentless attacks on public funded arts, media and humanities; the Bush Doctrine, and so on. And as I watched, there was this small voice telling me what we all know Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. I was shocked to learn that this hideous bureaucracy has been using every weapon at hand to demolish the arts in the US for at least 80 years. For this revelation alone, I honor these filmmakers.The history and political science are presented excellently here, and might be subjects for good documentaries. Believe it or not, I do like entertainment, and it's likely I would've missed the lessons had they been presented as documentaries. Instead, Tim has written one of the most compelling screenplays with very diverse human stories interwoven in what must've been a pitch to studio execs that was unwieldy and impossible to track. Not so in the execution. I write screenplays, and I am many times undone by the weight of my convictions. Not so with Cradle. The writing here is superb.To climax with a performance of the musical Cradle Will Rock booked in a vaudeville house in a last ditch effort after the Feds close down the original venue is divinely inspired. The show-must-go-on mentality produced with a pianist and piano on an empty stage, before a standing room only crowd of recently fired performers and technicians, their families, friends, and supporters is just bloody brilliant. When the performers stand up in the house to join the performance--Equity Union rules they cannot step on stage--when these performers step into their roles, rising up from the audience itself, and in spite of very real threats of being black balled--the effect is sublime. It's as though the observers become the observed--that alchemical magic every sincere performer strives to achieve. To accomplish this on film is rare. Sure, you often identify with a character in a film, but you often do it in a kind of hypnotic escapist state. This film achieves something more particular, more active in the way of audience/performer union.Cradle Will Rock is one of the best film arts arguments for democracy. It is a gift to all of us. Let us honor and treasure the filmmakers.

But we plus my parents felt the film was too agit-prop and the 20% of it that's over-the-top (aw come on, Hearst -- Citizen Kane foreshadowing, Rockefeller and a steel magnate at a Versailles costume party at the climax?) weakens the historical telling of a confluence of happenings -- the strangulation of the Federal Theater Project as a precursor victim to McCarthyism through the Dies Committee (including actual testimony wherein Christopher Marlowe was accused of being a Commie, as were the classic Greek dramatists) and Nelson Rockefeller's benighted sponsorship and then destruction of the Diego Rivera murals at Rockefeller Center. Effectively written and directed by Tim Robbins is how passionately political the artists were, not as card carrying Communists per se, but as committed anti-Fascists and unionists in every aspect of their personal lives--as equally committed as they were to the magic of the theater as a communication device. It does go over the top (including Susan Sarandon as an elegant Jewish courier to Mussolini selling stolen Old Masters), it is effective to show how TPTB were sympathetic to and profited from alliances with the fascists and how much they hated That Cripple in the White House.Amidst the politics, the art for art's sake oversize egos of John Houseman and Orson Welles are also well portrayed, if a shade as buffoons compared to the grimness of everyone else around them, most of whom needed these WPA jobs to keep from starving (there's a toss away line that barely explains that FDR had to throw the Theater Project to the wolves in order to save his whole alphabet soup of programs for the vast majority). It's also a bit over the top in painting those who testified at the Committee as probably crazy, but who knows. The Vanessa Redgrave character is silly but I guess it's making a point that Radical Chic is not new.The climax of the factual occurrence, the one and only original performance of Marc Blitzstein's ThreePenny Opera-inspired political musical Cradle Will Rock is a delightful recreation, and from what I've read, true to the real story. This is definitely a very un-1990's story.

Robbins effectively reduces Welles to an alcoholic homophobic buffoon with zero tolerance for an actor's personal needs.I never heard of this film until reading about it on an Orson Welles web site. The audience apparently stayed away in droves. It is not surprising to learn that the film recaptured less than ten percent of its budget at the box office. The film's commercial failure it seems has ended Robbins career as a writer/director.The film contains dozen of characters and numerous plot lines none of which generate any degree of sympathy for the audience to create an engaging story. Robbins' homage (or plagiarism) of Robert Altman's ensemble format fails badly as he tries to push his spin on historical fact. At least he posts a disclaimer, during the opening credits, that the film is mostly true. His message seems to be that those on the left are oppressed holders of the truth while those on the right are corrupt censors of artistic freedom.Another weak spot of the film is that the musical play itself is of dubious quality in both words and music. Robbins, to his credit, shows very little of the play's weak content.The cinematography in the film is very good as is the production design. But if Robbins ever gets the chance to write another film he should study up on screenplay structure and read Lajos Egri on character development.

My attention was immediately captured, and even more so during the very impressive one-take opening shot, which also boasts a lengthy line-up of casting credits that features everybody from Hank Azaria to Emily Watson, with no less than two Cusacks to seal the deal &#150; if there's one thing to be said about actors-turned-directors, it's that they can certainly bring in the big names. 'Cradle Will Rock (1999)' was Tim Robbins' third directorial effort, and he courageously tackles a wide assortment of political and social issues from 1930s America, as well as providing a commentary on the importance of art and culture as a means of expressing one's personal beliefs. It is only fitting that a film about the role of art be directed by a man who is obviously very passionate about his craft, and Robbins has produced a mature and intelligent comedy/drama.The film, based on the true story of Marc Blitzstein's 1937 musical The Cradle Will Rock, was originally planned as Orson Welles' final project, and pre-production commenced in 1983. However, not unusually for the great director, financial support was withdrawn shortly afterwards, and Welles passed away in 1985. Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria), a delusional playwright, pens a leftist labour musical based on his experiences with poverty-stricken households and the emerging union powers. Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones) of the Federal Theatre Project recognises the dramatic brilliance of the play and agrees to finance it, much to the consternation of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which is attempting to wheedle out anything that might possibly be construed as Communism. The dramatic prodigy Orson Welles (Angus Macfadyen) is hired to direct the play, and he impulsively decides to cast a homeless stagehand (Emily Watson) in the lead role, even though she can't sing. Meanwhile, Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) commissions artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) to paint a mural in his lobby, but is dismayed at the final result.Though Orson Welles merely plays a supporting role in the proceedings, he is played with delicious verve by relative unknown Angus Macfadyen. His portrayal is completely overplayed, presenting the director and performer as a flamboyant caricature, probably the only approach if one is to capture a personality as outrageous as that of Orson Welles. Though the film itself lacks some narrative focus in that it attempts to cover too many themes and characters, all the loose-ends satisfactorily come together for the climax, the incredibly-energetic opening performance of The Cradle Will Rock. I was once again reminded of the considerable talents of John Turturro, who brilliantly and convincingly evolves from the shy, humble Italian family man off-stage to his character of the strong, assertive union leader. Robbins also intercuts the play performance with the heartless desecration of Diego Rivera's politically-charged artwork mural, ironically contrasting the presentation of great art with its inevitable destruction by those who could never appreciate its importance to human culture.

It seems everyone in Hollywood wanted to get in on this one. The biggest problem I had with the film was that if you weren't one of the warmly-portrayed socialists, then you were either a simple minded right wing alarmist, or a big businessman in bed with the fascists.One thing is clear - Robbins and Sarandon yearn for the days when being part of the far, far left was fashionable.

Tim Robbins' ode to theater, the passion for arts (acting, in particular), freedom of speech and the price you have to pay for believing and living for it (art vs. politics), is an underrated mosaic of some very exquisite personalities (Orson Welles, Nelson Rockefeller, Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, John Houseman, Hazel Huffman, among others) that are, one way or another, involved with a musical play that's about to be closed down for being communist, in 1936's New York. Nicholls (who has a cameo as George Zorn) said that most of the actors worked almost for free, out of friendship for Robbins and love for theater, and that Cradle Will Rock's poor reception at the box-office/critics, is the main reason why Robbins hasn't directed another movie since then. That's a shame, since this is even better than his previous directorial efforts (Bob Roberts and Dead Man Walking), which were much easier films. It's true you have to know at least a little bit about the people portrayed here in order to fully appreciate/understand the film, and movies like this don't usually become blockbusters, but the fact that Cradle Will Rock was ignored altogether and seems quite forgotten is really sad. The ensemble cast is one of the best I've ever seen - Emily Watson, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, Joan Cusack, Cherry Jones, John Turturro, Susan Sarandon, John Cusack, Cary Elwes, Angus Macfadyen, Paul Giamatti, Bob Balaban, Hank Azaria, Jack Black, Philip Baker Hall, among others - and the screenplay is Altmanesque tapestry at its best. Hopefully, this film will be discovered in a not so distant future, and get the acclaim it deserves. 10/10.

This film also hints at the future of film, as Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst are characters in the film, moving in similar circles, seemingly on a collision course that happens later when Welles depicts Hearst in Citizen Kane. Robbins wrote and directed the film, and he should be applauded for meticulously weaving in so many interesting characters and powerful themes into a film.

The play in question fell under suspicion of having hidden Communist, or at least left-wing, messages.  Perhaps the only  characters which are fleshed out beyond a single dimension are those played by Cherry Jones (a feisty and eloquent woman managing the federal theatre program) and John Turturro, an Italian-American actor with a large family to support.  Surprisingly, this movie extends mercilessly beyond two hours without any real indication of tension or conflict.  Unfortunately, both the advocates of censorship and the play's valiant supporters are depicted as silly and innocent- as if Robbins was too distracted by the quaintness of the period- which robs the story of any real impact.  Rockefeller, the personification of censorship based upon ignorance, is written as being at worst a mere fool who flirts with artists without understanding art.

I'm not sure where the audience for this movie might be.  Those who are familiar with the people and events of the 30s depicted here will probably be offended by the offensively cartoonish portrayals.  (Angus MacFadyen's tipsy, lightweight performance as Orson Welles vies for the worst and whoever told Emily Watson she could sing should be forced to listen to her tone-deaf vocalizing in a locked room for 24 hours straight.)  The hectic intercutting from one storyline to another and the careening, show-offy camera work leave the viewer more exhausted than exhilarated from trying to keep up with what's going on.  The final 20 minutes culminate in a ramshackle audience-participation performance of excerpts from Marc Blitzstein's dated musical play (nobody was allowed on the stage) that seems almost unendurable due to a lack of vocal talent and Robbin's aggressive insistence on eliciting viewer cheers by going to frequent closeups of people onscreen cheering.

Mussolini obediently submitted to his requests and promulgated the race manifesto, despite counting many Jews among his friends and acquaintances himself, like his ex lover the writer Margherita Sarfatti2. Margherita Sarfatti was a strong supporter of Mussolini, but that changed when the racial laws were passed. She soon left the fascist party and went to Argentina. So if she ever went to the USA to promote Mussolini, this was surely before the regime turned anti-semitic.3. Italy and Germany did not attack Spain. They aided and military and politically supported the nationalist rebels leaded by Franco, who tried a coup during the civil war to restore a conservative regime which had been subverted by the late socialist government and numerous anarchist riots.

Many Italian Marxists, communists and socialists also went and fought in Spain alongside the republican forces - which were aided by the URSS - against the falangistas and the fascist regular troops. 4.

In my understanding there was wide sympathy and support for Italian fascism in the American parlors, which isn't as apparent watching the movie.

I am really sorry that I missed watching Mildred Pierce on TCM for the 80th time to go see this, though.I am a liberal and, as such, always enjoy a good story about the plight of the oppressed.  What I hate with a passion is when a film resorts to Eisenstein-era stereotypes like the good homeless person and the bad cop and the free-thinking artist and the bad tycoon and... you get the picture, to make its point.You can tell this movie has the potential to be a complete bomb in the first 10 minutes, when the camera self-importantly tracks one character uninterruptedly a la Orson Welles and the rest throw away unintelligible expositional dialogue to let us know whether they are good (i.e., poor) or bad (i.e., rich).  Welles, like Hitchcock and many others in this age of Steadicams, did the uncut tracking shot masterfully, suspensefully, infusing almost every frame with some kind of significance and moving the story forward at the same time.  Tim Robbins' shot is empty.  Oh, sure, you could make something out of it if you wanted but, ultimately, the shot is just there to say, Neat, hah?  It doesn't mean a thing.Neither does much of what follows, and I'm glad I didn't stay to find out if anything would.  It's like, going into it, the makers figured they were going to make the kind of film that people made in the sixties where it was accepted who the good and the bad guys were, so you just needed to get to the payoff scene where a) the workers are massacred or b) the workers rise together and triumph.  So Robbins plunges forth without taking any time to connect us with his characters or with the complexities beneath their surface, to make us participate in what makes them tick.  They are just assigned a function, and off they go into the plot.Susan Sarandon and Vanessa Redgrave as a fascist and a decadent aristocrat respectively are ridiculous pieces of obvious casting against type.  But since the whole film is so firmly planted in stereotypes, when it tries to go against them, as with the casting of these two characters, it is transparent and self-evident.If you miss movies like Sacco e Vanzetti or They Don't Wear Black Tie, you'll probably eat this up.

Stories about Diego Rivera's controversial mural at New York's Rockefeller Center (home of Saturday Night Live/The Today Show) and a ventriloquist played by Bill Murray are juxtaposed alongside the main storyline though they don't exactly intersect. It's kind of curious.The film's main accomplishments are it's frenetic pace and it's juggling of multiple story lines. There's a lot of energy from scene to scene even as the focus jumps. As (what I presume is) a homage to Orson Welles himself, Robbins introduces characters with long and graceful tracking shots and never lets the camera get bored. His film covers a wide tapestry of struggling artists in the Great Depression (even moving history a little to allow Rivera and Welles/Houseman to collide) and shines a light on the forces that drive them. Some are hungry to make a statement, some are hungry to be creative, some are hungry for social standing and many are literally hungry.The film boasts a great number of top-name actors including the Tenacious (Kyle Gass and Jack Black) before they were famous, both Cusack siblings, great character actors Philip Baker Hall and Paul Giamatti, Susan Sarandon, Bill Murray, Hank Azaria, Cary Elwes and Emily Watson.Emily Watson, in particular, is a diamond in the rough here.

It's frustrating for me to watch because I saw all this potential that didn't so much go to waste as it did go to the wrong task.Case in point the movie starts out with an impressive shot of Olive Stanton (Emily Watson) waking up behind the screen of a blaring newsreel which gives us all the Depression-era history needed to understand the plot.  Without pulling any tricks, the shot holds on her as she ties her shoes and walks slowly out of the building onto the street.  The whole thing takes maybe three minutes or so, and at no point are there any cuts or changes in angle, so at this point I was already thinking Great, this is going to be a really focused film!It wasn't.  After those first three minutes I don't recall there being a scene (let alone a shot) that lasted for more than a minute and a half. Very quickly we're introduced to approximately four interwoven story lines (some of the weaving is mighty loose) and for the next two hours we're treated to nonstop bouncing from plot to plot to plot - all of them intriguing, but none of them invested enough to give any real sense of payoff by the end.  Even during the final sequences when I felt what may have been goosebumps festering along my arms there was such an excess of change-ups I grew impatient.  I wanted to shout Make up your mind!The cinematography is excellent nevertheless, and the performances are all perfectly on-key (Angus Macfadyen's depiction of Orson Welles alone is enough to redeem any faults, and any opportunity to watch Bill Murray further prove his genius is not to be missed).  Robbins played many scenes off comically in homage to the over-the-top vaudevillian style of the 30s, yet balances this effect of gracefully with touches of humanity and pristinely-crafted drama.  Still, I often found myself wondering how much more would have been brought to a historical (though admittedly tampered) movie such as this by making it more grainy and real as opposed to polished and pampered.Even so, to its credit Cradle Will Rock is still a quality piece of entertainment and I do in fact recommend it.  The major underlying problem that ultimately pushed the movie down from its promising golden pedestal was that the viewer comes away feeling that Tim Robbins wasn't quite sure what he wanted to come of his efforts - or, rather, he knew what he wanted us to reap emotionally in the end, but he couldn't decide what needed to be sown in order to get there.  Extending the metaphor to painful extremes he planted every seed he could get his hands on and ended up with acre upon acre of stunted crops.I'm going to just shut up now and give it seven stars (but it could have been nine...) "},{"Title":"Interesting historically-based realism","Date":"11 March 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Tim Robbins' Cradle Will Rock is an interesting movie about real-life social issues, politics, the arts, and events during the Great Depression era. This movie chronicles an important time in 20th century United States history when the collapse of the Stock Market lead to a high unemployment rate that affected the lives of many families. People faced desperation through starvation, homelessness, and intense competition during the shortage of jobs. In addition to economic and employment woes, this was a climate that increasingly bred uncertainty about the future, suspicions about outside threats to capitalism and democracy (specifically, the movie addresses communism and fascism), and concerns regarding censorship of artistic expression and freedom of speech. This movie cleverly examines all of these matters while primarily following the creation of the actual Cradle Will Rock musical production during the era. Sponsored by the Federal Theatre Project (FTA) under the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the United States, the film focuses on a rich ensemble of characters (involved in the arts, theatre, and otherwise). According to this web site (http//memory.loc.gov/ammem/fedtp/ftwpa.html), the FTP was responsible for bringing theatre to millions of citizens throughout the United States, financially supported the growth of theatres, and provided opportunities for theatre professionals. In the real Cradle Will Rock, the playwright Marc Blitzstein wrote about the social and political issues of the era, especially surrounding labor and unions. The political nature of this lead to the controversy touched upon by the film. During the political climate that fostered growing suspicions about perceived threats to the American way of life, Robbins' brings to the screen a historically-based account about how the arts were specifically challenged and alleged as a medium to spread what were considered dangerous messages against American ideals. In particular, the motives and agendas of artists were questioned and suppressed under intense scrutiny. Robbins' Cradle Will Rock presents the realities of this era blended with just the right balance of exposition, drama, and comedic elements. The humor lightens the mood but does not distract from the seriousness of the situations faced by people during this era. The characters are presented with realism that transports you into the struggles and triumphs of their lives. Although the ensemble of characters was interesting, there could have been more depth in some instances. For instance, there were many great sub-plots that were only briefly touched upon. However, to be fair, the goal of this film was probably not to cram an in-depth examination of their lives, so much as it was to utilize the spectrum of characters to showcase diversity in their experiences. In this, we are exposed to a variety of ideals and values, individual and family experiences, and contrasts between the struggling working class and the elite. Center stage is the question surrounding the definitions of American values, ideals, as well as the boundaries of artistic expression. This is definitely one of those movies where some may gain a greater appreciation if they can view it a second time. There is a lot going on with the variety of characters and issues this film examines. This is not a dry, dull historical account, but rather a surface inspection of the Depression era and a country with challenging social and political issues. Viewers may want to enhance their understanding of the events touched upon by the film by learning more about the real, historical events. For instance, we only receive a few, although effective, examples of what people experienced during the climate of the Red Scare. Finally, Robbins' Cradle Will Rock will probably challenge many to think about the potential pros and cons of government response during social and political issues. For instance, the WPA and FTP improved the lives of millions of United States citizens; however, the paranoia surrounding the suspected infiltration of anti-American principles shadowed these accomplishments.

Not big in terms of blockbuster big, but big in terms of the stories and history portrayed in the film. Robbins has the undertaking of telling several stories tying them all together with the accusation of the chief characters' participation in anti-American activities. Organizing unions and communism are at the center of the conflict portrayed in this film, set in depression-era New York. Chief among the stories are pro-Union play Cradle Will Rock, the Diego Rivera painting Lenin in Rockefeller Center, and accusations of communism being represented in plays funded by the Federal Government.Robbins brings to life the attitudes of the day through the eyes of several fictional and non fictional participants in these events. Toturro and Watson portray actors in the eponymous play, who risk not being able to work in theater again if they act in the play, shut down by the federal government. Bill Murray (in a great, but ignored performance) and Joan Cusack work for the federal theater, and are vocal about there thoughts about communism. Stealing the show, however, are Cherry Jones, as Hallie Flannagan, brilliantly testifying her case before the government denying being a communist, and Hank Azaria, who subtly plays out the role of Cradle Will Rock's writer Marc Blitzstein with great passion.There are some liberties with the history. These events occurred at different times, but Robbins has them occur at the same time, to illustrate their historical significance and similarities. And while the event regarding the much fabled first performance of Cradle Will Rock is heavily dramatized, it's beautifully played out.Of course, Robbins has his hands in politics and this film is an example of that, but, politics aside, this is a brilliantly acted piece illustrating events in history long forgotten. One of the highlights of this film is the music from Cradle Will Rock, which before viewing this film, I wasn't familiar with. As one watches the film, they will realize that the play has some Brecht/Weil (Threepenny Opera) influences. This film is so passionate about its material, that encourages one to dig deeper, and read more about the play and its creator and the history presented here.

Welle's Mercury theater was part of the FTA. This movie was extremely well researched. Angus McFayden does a great job as Welles. Countering him is Cary Elwes as John Houseman. We recently had this theatre treasure come to us as Professor Kingsfield in The Paper Chase film and TV series. Will Geer, part of Welles's group was the grandfather in The Waltons. Viewers will get a wonderful rendering of a largely forgotten Musical by Marc Blitztein and Bertholt Brecht. The cradle will rock is a pro-worker anti-big business piece that rocked the theatre going world in an era where Big Business was largely responsible for the working man's woes. Interwoven within the basic plot of the composition and production of this play are subplots dealing with Mexican painter Diego Rivera (some of whose murals are visible even today) and art dealings by Musolini's mistress.This is a very compelling film well directed and acted. A must see for musical theater students, and just about everyone else.

The scope of this film is immense and yet it manages to be personal and moving.Each performance in Cradle hits right on the mark, despite much being made about Susan Sarandon's lack of performance or Emily Watson's lack of singing ability. Forgive my tangent, but her lack of singing ability is the point. Need we recall Orson Welles ranting, She's terrible, why did we cast her? Particularly notable are Bill Murray and Hank Azaria.As a director, Tim Robbins has done some marvelous work here, adding a certain theatricality which adds to the theme of the film. It feels like a live performance, particularly in a scene backstage where the camera meanders around the theatre picking up bits of conversation as it goes in a remarkably staged scene that must have taken hours to rehearse just to get the timing. The juxtapositions of high society's artistic discussions with rehearsals of Cradle Will Rock, and the performance of Cradle with the demolition of the Rivera piece are stunning.And then of course there is the social commentary. Tim Robbins is clearly left-leaning (but so am I), but the movie is relatively fairly balanced. Ironically, it is the unions, not the government, which keep cradle from being performed in its original venue.The reason I rate this a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the film's accessibility. To a person unfamiliar with art or the depression or the red scare, this movie would not have much meaning. But if you meet the viewing criteria, this is one of the best.

Also, as one who has studied that period in American theater history, I appreciated the story as wonderfully redemptive and satisfying. It's essential to dramatize artfully the crucial issues that confront us, especially in hard times when citizens are so caught up in basic survival, and vulnerable to official scare tactics that we neglect to maintain our fight for civil liberties and artistic freedom. The present is one of those times, and so was the Depression. Tim Robbins did his best here, within his craft, to make the important interesting. I was very pleased with this effort.

The production design was grand, the cast couldn't be better known, and the story had potential.  Sadly I had the same trouble with it that I do with Robert Altman's movies there's an enormous amount of energy on display but it's unfocused.  Plot lines come and go.  Individual scenes can be fascinating and some of the one liners are amusing.  Here is a drunken Nelson Rockefeller with his shirt tails hanging out doing an impromptu dance with Diego Rivera's girl friend, a well-known artist in her own right.  A hypomanic Welles stuffing himself at 21, guzzling wine, and dealing contemptuously with John Houseman's homosexual snits.  Rivera insisting that Lenin STAYS! in his mural at Rockefeller Center.  (He doesn't.)  The movie itself has no center to speak of.  Characters wander around as in Ragtime but they bump into one another glancingly, if at all, and if anything Cradle Will Rock is more fragmented than Ragtime.  A good deal of attention is paid to a spontaneous march up the street from a theater that has been locked up in order to keep out the Communists in the WPA's theater project, to another one, at least as large, which turns out to be packed for a performance of The Cradle Will Rock.  The last 20 minutes or so shows us Marc Blitzstein's musical play, which must have been innovative in its time.  The characters in the play are not well established -- things must have been left out -- and the music is not Gershwin or Kern.  It's a chronicle of the times, true, although a confusing one.  I couldn't always tell when Blitzstein's fantasies began and reality left off, if the mixed narrative threads weren't enough.  It's not a bad movie.  And it certainly doesn't insult the viewer as so many movies currently do.  The smiles that this one elicits come from an appreciation of the ironies involved.

At first, I only knew of it because I'm an ardent Bill Murray fan, but after seeing it and seeing it again (again, again, again...), there is so much more to praise.  The depression era of American history is rarely viewed from the perspective that Cradle Will Rock offers, so on one hand, it is important to watch it just for that.  Many people may be acquainted with McCarthy and his efforts to stamp out communism but that battle pre-dated him by decades and was waged with more fervor by our government in general during a period when the working poor suffered everytime they tried to unite.  Similar themes of corruption, monopoly and oppression exist now, but it rarely noticed. Jumping into the Cradle Will Rock could bring revival of that old fight.Another revival is of the centerpiece musical itself.  I was blessed to recently see the Cradle Will Rock performed by the excellent Jean Cocteau Repertory in New York City.  At a synposium afterward, the director (who also crafted this year's lineup) admitted that he was pleased at the timing of the Tim Robbins' film, but that he planned to do the Marc Blitzstein piece regardless.  Others aren't as tied to the musical as is this director, but perhaps the film will bring a revival for this wonderful and still timely social commentary.

An anachronism born 50 years too late, he endures as a passionate liberal crusader in an age of capitalistic dominance.  &#145;The Cradle Will Rock',  written and directed by Robbins, is a pining for the glory days of the socialist and labor movements in the United States.  It is a nostalgic piece with leftist sensitivities, written by one who wishes he had been there.This is a well assembled but bloated ensemble piece, based on fact, that centers on the federal theater program of the mid 1930's.  This program was an outgrowth of the WPA from the depression years that gave federal funding to the arts to give employment to out of work actors, with the thinking that good theater would be good to boost the moral of the masses.  Unfortunately, Robbins was overly ambitious in this collage, attempting to weave together no less than four virtually unrelated stories.  The result is a whirlwind of disjointed jump cuts that distracts the viewer from the only engaging storyline, namely the production of Marc Blitzstein's play.  The disparate barrage of stories, assembled carefully to wax nostalgic about the leftist movement, had little appeal to anyone but those with a predilection to such waxing.  For everyone else, it just diluted the effectiveness of the main storyline, which is a pity because it was a good human interest story.That story shows a young Orson Welles directing a new play sympathetic to the labor movement.  The play and the federal theater program come under scrutiny of the U.S. Government.  The play is closed down on opening night and federal troops sent to barricade the doors of the theater, because the play is believed to have a communist message.  In a defiant act, Welles finds another theater and herds the audience from the front door of the garrisoned theater to the new one where the play is to be performed as a one man show by the author, the only man not in the union.  All the other actors are under orders not to perform lest they lose their jobs, a daunting thought in depression times.  The play goes on with a dramatic and uplifting twist at the end. The whole ensemble did a terrific job.  All the actors gave wonderful performances, though they needed to find someone with a voice better than Emily Watson's for the singing role.  Though I have been critical of John Turturro in the past (&#145;Illuminata' for instance) his was a standout performance in a very talented ensemble.  Ruben Blades was also terrific as the eccentric Diego Rivera.Overall, it was a decent effort at tackling a subject that simply no longer has an audience.  Robbins did a good job on the period props and sets, and the scenes brought forth frankly many of the real issues of the day (with a decidedly leftward slant).  But the film dissipates itself on irrelevant scenes designed to serve as a catharsis for every injustice Robbins saw in the times.  That jihad annuls some good performances by rendering the film a mediocre hodgepodge.I rated the film a 6/10.  It had greater potential but flubbed it.  If you are a staunch conservative capitalist type, don't waste your time with this film.  It will just aggravate you.  If you long for the days of passionate liberal activism, you will love it, but if you are just looking for entertainment, you will probably be disappointed.

That said, I absolutely hated the film's treatment of John Houseman and, especially, Orson Welles.  If you're a fan of Welles, you won't like Angus Macfadyn's portrayel.  It is utterly impossible to catch even a glimpse, in this film, of the genius that would give the world Citizen kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, and Touch of Evil.

With 1999's Cradle Will Rock, Robbins returns to the territory that sees people in the entertainment business struggling to lead the lives they would desperately like to. Only this time, he is directing a film about a group of people that do not so much need a reality check and to go through a blender of facing the repercussions one brings upon one's self, as much as he directs a bunch of characters trying to survive as the Great Depression consumes everything around it and desperation threatens creeps in.Like The Player, Cradle Will Rock opens up with a wonderful long take in a theatre, detailing the necessary surroundings; the sorts of people the film will be spending time with and gets across a general feel for the era in which it's set by having a news reel play in the background. It's a slow and deliberate opening, hovering and focusing on one individual as they lie there, back stage; capturing what will follow a hovering and a focusing on people within an industry the stereotypical image of which might be glitz, glamour and riches. These people are just trying to get by.Cradle Will Rock is set amongst those in the theatrical business in 1930s America, as opposed to the film industry in the 1990s. While systematically looking at art-forms and the want for some to censor art within this world, director Robbins paints a wonderful canvas of the class system within this time and how different struggles affect each and every one of the different layers of life. The film is often quite funny, even surrealistic in its gags, but it never trivialises the bigger picture of the situation and nor does it exploit those struggling for means of entertainment even though they are working within the boundaries of an entertainment medium.Amongst the all star cast is Marc Blitzstein (Azaria), a deep thinking and spiritual piano player desperately looking for inspiration and a tune to nail to his upcoming musical entitled Cradle Will Rock, the very piece everyone will come together and find solace with. We also get a steady turn from Bill Murray, as he plays Tommy Crickshaw, an ageing puppeteer who is tied to two young protégés. Then there is Angus Macfadyen's wonderfully eccentric portrayal of Orson Welles, as a young and energetic director so desperately trying to succeed in completing a play with his producer John Houseman (Elwes). On another equilibrium, John Cusak's Nelson Rockefeller gets into all sorts of bother with a Mexican artist that paints a wonderful mosaic on the wall of Rockefeller's theatre only to refuse removing Lenin's face he has included. Robbins effortlessly taps into the growing fears of Communism at the time but additionally finds time to present an argument on censorship without taking sides.Cradle Will Rock is essentially a feel-good piece. Its title suggests potential disaster, an ominous event about to occur, particularly if we think back to what follows 'cradle will rock' in the popular rhyme. To give away whether things come crashing down or not is a spoiler of sorts if you're not familiar with how the real 1937 events eventually transpired. Each character is given enough time for us to be able to resonate with them. The film is concerned with different aspects of certain artists and their fields. Blitzstein's face and hands as he plays the piano are given more attention than anything else as he goes through all the emotions in trying to write his musical. This is accompanied by the very sporadic and energetic Welles, whose body language and hand all-over-the-place-hand-gestures gets across most of the urgency in regards to his respective situation. Further still, the Mexican artist that paints Rockefeller's wall, as well as Tommy Crickshaw, use their tired and experienced hands to carve a living out of what are, essentially, art forms in themselves; those being painting and ventriloquy.The Mexican artist's painting forces the film to raise some interesting issues. Rockefeller wishes to censor the inclusion of Lenin so as not to confuse onlookers; so as not to force contextual analysis of why the head might be there. It is a tampering of art, something that echoes what drives the final third which is a cancellation of the show and the stopping of an art-form from playing out in its true form. This oppositional reading idea is hit upon a second time in the film when a newspaper reads what seems to be a harmless children's play about beavers, in an entirely different fashion. Thankfully, common sense prevails and something transpires; an event that the old phrase 'the show must go on' could well have derived from.Cradle Will Rock is a brilliantly acted and wonderfully directed film, with a distinct energy and applied assurance on Tim Robbins' behalf &#x96; it is a shame he has only very few directing credits following this project. The film is an homage, of sorts, to theatre; set at a time when it was becoming second-fiddle to cinema barely years after the introduction of sound on screen. The rousing and affirming finale rounds off what is, essentially, a rousing and affirming film about a play depicting harsh realities of life, but never underplaying them.

Everyone talked like Katharine Hepburn and people wore beautiful clothes. In the 1930s, the working man began to have a voice with the works of William Sarayoan, Clifford Odets, and Maxwell Anderson, among others. During the Depression, FDR started the WPA, and the Federal Theatre Project was one of its programs. The Cradle Will Rock is a leftist labor musical by Marc Blitzstein that is chosen by Hallie Flanagan, head of the FTP, to premiere at the Maxine Elliott Theater in New York. The politics of the FTP come under question, the theater is locked, and the actors are forbidden to appear on stage.Orson Welles finds another theater for the production, and the story of the opening night performance, spontaneously performed by the cast from the audience as Blitzstein sat up on stage and played, was thought to be one of the most exciting moments in theater history by those who were there.Robbins focuses on the controversy surrounding the musical but also on several other important events. Maybe, in the end, it is too much content, but fascinating nonetheless. Diego Rivera, an avowed Communist, played by Ruben Blades, is hired by Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusak) to paint a mural at Rockefeller Center. Rockefeller, however, doesn't like the revolutionary tone of the mural. One of the actors, played by John Turturro, has to deal with a family that supports Mussolini's Black Shirts.Marc Blitzstein, in focusing on a prostitute in The Cradle Will Rock, asks us who the real prostitutes are, and Robbins shows us in his depictions of Rockefeller, Hearst, and the Senate committee before which Hallie Flanagan testifies, the thin and sometimes nonexistent line between art and politics.The performances are terrific. Just about everyone is a standout, with John Turturro in an especially showy role as a man who wants to demonstrate principles and ethics to his children. Ruben Blades and Corina Katt Ayala could have been Rivera and Frida Kahlo, the resemblance is so strong. Vanessa Redgrave is excellent as Countess LaGrange, a wealthy woman who gets caught up in the proceedings. The gifted Broadway star Cherry Jones gives another strong performance as Hallie Flanagan, and Emily Watson is marvelous as Olive Stanton. The minute I heard the vocal rhythm of Angus Macfadyen, I knew he was playing Orson Welles. He does a beautiful job, as does Susan Sarandon as Margherita Sarfatti, Mussolini's ex-mistress who came to the U.S. to sell Mussolini to the American people via William Randolph Hearst's newspapers.Well worth seeing, and the period is well worth reading about.

In Dead Man Walking he had the ability to present a very poignant view both for and against capital punishment.  Here, there is no such attempt.  What is even more baffling, is this shallow view of the situation.  It was not just about art and politics as this story would suggest.  Economic factors came into play also.  By the end of this film, it has disintegrated into a goofy exercise in politics and poor story-telling despite outstanding performances from the cast.

After Congress cuts funding for the embattled Federal Theater over the perceived leftist slant of their presentations, the project is canceled on the day of its premier. Welles and his cast respond by marching 21 blocks from the theater where the show was to open to another venue where, in deference to Actors Equity regulations, they perform the entire show from the audience. A member of Welles' cast, Aldo Silvano, is a dedicated actor from Italy who is trying to resolve his attitudes about his family, who loyally support Mussolini, to Silvano's disgust. Meanwhile, El Duce's former mistress, Margherita Sarfatti, is consorting with industrial tycoon Gray Mathers,whose wife, Contesse LaGrange is a friend and supporter of Welles' project. Elsewhere, Nelson Rockefeller has hired ex-patriot Mexican artist Diego Rivera to create a mural for his projected Rockefeller Center, but the two are soon locking horns over their different views on art, politics and the work at hand. And a ventriloquist fallen on hard times, Tommy Crickshaw, finds himself trying to teach both comedy and speaking without lip movements to a pair of would-be performers at a WPA-backed vaudeville house. Art and politics collide in Tim Robbins' ambitious but not entirely successful effort to recreate a unique moment in American culture circa 1937.It presents good entertainment with superior acting performances and a stellar cast.Also,as a mixture of drama, humor and history, a mélange of seriousness and slapstick, real people and imagined characters, it definitely stands out.

Featuring characters like Orson Welles, the Rockefellers, Diego Garcia and a slew of U.S. political figures, the movie is grounded in the mostly true stories of the pre-war red scare, as the Federal funded arts came under attack from the House Un-American Activities committee. Specifically, the story revolves around a pro-labor union musical of the same name, directed by Orson Welles, that is forced to shut down.  The story is mirrored in the business relations of the Rockefellers, who make underhanded deals with Italian fascists while destroying Diego Rivera's beautiful mural in their skyscraper because of it's controversial nature.The movie is not avant-garde in its own right, but certainly celebrates the artists who championed the avant-garde theatre of the 30's.  The acting is superb, featuring yet another energetic and truthful performance by Turturro, a revisited melancholy malaise by Bill Murray, a dead-on Welles played by underrated MacFayden, and really just splendid performances by everyone in this cast.Cradle Will Rock will not appeal to everyone's taste, as it takes a rather hard line towards leftist viewpoints, but the message of the movie goes beyond the politics of left or right. The movie is a celebration of the artist as a cog in the works of American life, and how bravery and strength in the face of fear kept the spirit of freedom alive in not only the theatre, but in humanity itself as pride and dignity persevered.

Tim Robbins made an assured if unconventional film director debut with Bob Roberts, and his follow-up could barely be more different.Taking his stylistic cue from Robert Altman, with whom he worked on The Player, the story is about a play, the eponymous The Cradle Will Rock, to be directed by the up and coming Orson Welles. Set against the political and artistic upheaval of the late 30's, at a time when Commies and Red were perhaps the two most feared words in middle America, Welles stumbles upon the writing of playwright Marc Blitzstein. He has written a play about the impoverished workers rising up against corruption, screaming and singing about their right to earn an honest buck. We are witness to every step of the artistic process, from Blitzstein (the incomparable Hank Azaria) writing the words and music alone, haunted by his former lover and his nemesis, through the political difficulties of putting on such a play at the time for all involved, along with the actors - both accomplished and untested - making their mark for different reasons, as well as observing the struggle of those working for the government, the theatre and the art world in general. Thrown into the mix are a ventriloquist fighting the end of vaudeville, artist Diego Rivera holding onto his artistic scruples in light of a commission from businessman Nelson Rockefeller and a homeless, penniless singer who can't sing, but has a pure heart.With so many elements - the artistic, the narrative, the political and the historical - thrown together, it could have been a hard film to get into, yet Robbins wastes no time in showing that if you immerse yourself in the world he is illustrating, there is much entertainment and education to be taken from the finished product. His masterstroke is in making the film both heavily theatrical, as most films about theatre are, yet purely cinematic. While many of the performances are so theatrical as to be almost over-the-top - notably Angus McFadyen as Welles and Cary Elwes as his producer - those outside the theatre world are more measured - Emily Watson has never been more beautiful or effective than here as the poor outsider; Susan Sarandon is both funny and touching as a frustrated art dealer stuck in a crowd of high-society money men - and the technical elements of the film are handled perfectly. The camera glides through corridors, streets and windows from one scenario to another, tying all the strands together; the period detail is spot on without being in your face; the editing and music are by turns calm and frenetic, tightening as the film progresses and events get more desperate.And then there is the cast. Perhaps the biggest influence of Altman is evident in the casting, perhaps one of the finest ensemble casts ever assembled. While everyone acquits themselves wonderfully, special mention must go to Azaria and Watson, the film's heart, from different ends of the spectrum, each dealing with their own demons and shortcomings with tenderness and pathos, easily holding their own against a cast of screen luminaries. Sarandon is as good as she has ever been, nailing a difficult accent and drawing a truly interesting if politically ambiguous character. Vanessa Redgrave is having more fun than she ever seems to have had on film as someone with a lot of swing, who is just going along for the ride. Ruben Blades - nice to see him in such a notable role after an unfair number of years in the wilderness - is a joy as Rivera, displaying the conviction and lack of morals which marked out Rivera's personal life and the greatness of his professional life. Likewise John Cusack, having a ball as Rockefeller, and coming across as likeable at first, unforgiveable by the close. And finally, Bill Murray, showing once again that no-one can mix sharp one-line humour and tragedy as well as he. He is hilarious and pathetic at the same time, a man out of time with his finger no longer on the pulse of the common man's tastes or politics. In recent years he has gained notoriety for his tragi-comic performances in films such Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums and the forthcoming Lost in Translation, and he is as good here as in any of these.Perhaps an understanding of the period depicted would make the film more enjoyable, but it is by no means essential. I knew next to nothing of the events of the film and i found it to be hilarious, touching and educational, an intellectual gem in a sea of retarded kiss-kiss, bang-bang. Treat yourself on a rainy day and dig this one out. You won't regret it.

The title in and of itself is rather curious, so I read the plotline, which was intriguing, and the cast, which contained a lot of actors whose work I admire immensely. However, the presence of an all-star cast can be deceiving (such as in John Wayne's 1956 debacle The Conqueror). While I was debating whether to rent this movie, I looked at a lot of reviews online and feared that most of them were overwhelmingly negative, but I took a chance on it and rented it anyway. I'm definitely that I did, and in fact, I want to add it to my DVD library.The plot concerns the musical Cradle Will Rock, a left-leaning (actually downright socialist) musical by Federal Theatre Program employee Mark Blitzstein (Hank Azaria), and the subsequent attempt by the government to shut it down. Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones), head of the Federal Theatre Project, tries vehemently to assure its continuation, and is called to testify in Washington amidst accusations that the Federal Theatre Project is infested with Communists. Meanwhile, rehearsals continue despite the personal problems of many of the main characters such as Olive Stanton (Emily Watson), a penniless young woman who hopes of becoming a great actress, and Aldo Silvano (John Turturro), an idealistic Italian immigrant/family man, ashamed of both his poverty and his family's ties to Mussolini. Meanwhile, Nelson Rockefeller's (John Cusack) appreciation for art throws him in the midst of a connundrum by two opposing political points of view he is dealing with fascist art critic Margharita Sarfatti (Susan Sarandon), Mussolini's former mistress and now-ambassador, who plans to gain favor for Italy with wealthy, powerful individuals such as himself and steel magnate Gray Mathers (Philip Baker Hall). However, Rockefeller has commissioned the Communist Mexican muralist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) to create a piece of art for the lobby of Rockefeller Center (and is surprised when he does).The movie is marked by a number of strong performances. Cherry Jones's performance is usually the one that is identified as the best in the reviews that I read, and she does indeed give an intelligent, subtly powerful one. Emily Watson's portrayal can almost be called tearjerker-worthy; she does appear aptly vulnerable and innocent, as her character must, but there is something rather flat about her character until the end. I am, however, partial to four of the performances in general John Turturro's, who as of yet, has never failed me in any of the movies he is in; Ruben Blades, who serves not only as commentary, but as occasional comic relief as the very politically passionate Rivera; and Jack Black and Kyle Gass of the musical duo Tenacious D, are hilarious as Tommy Crickshaw's (Bill Murray) inept ventriloquist protégés.One criticism I have about the film is how unfavorably Joan Cusak's character (a vehemently anti-Communist employment office clerk) is portrayed. While I consider myself fairly liberal, and balked at how her conservative politics cause much trouble for the artists in the movie, I thought that her portrayal could potentially give conservatives who rail against the elitism of the liberal intelligentsia an example of such elitism without even realizing it. Another criticism I have is that some people may be thrown off by the Nelson Rockefeller/Diego Rivera subplot, which seems completely irrelevant to the movie. Robbins, in my opinion, should have had a stronger tie between the two subplots than the Countess LeGrange (Vanessa Redgrave), the wife of Gray Mathers, and a patron of both Rivera's art and Blitzstein's musical. Robbins also could have done away with the character of Bertold Brecht (Steven Skybell), who served the role of Blitzstein's conscience but actually did very little to develop the plot.Despite these criticisms, Cradle Will Rock is overall, a strong film definitely worth watching. The themes presented in this movie censorship, freedom of expression, the ability to create art without fear of oppression, and the right to disagree with one's government, are especially pertinent today. Whether you agree with Tim Robbins' politics or not, Cradle Will Rock will make you think, if you are indeed open to its message.

This is the message that Marc Blitzein was sending in his play written in 1936 and that is why it never seen the light of Broadway.

One of the parts of this movie is the inside look that is given to the Federal Theater Project and the idea behind it. To get theater out to the people, to sponsor works that are not only entertaining but have a message. To make people think! When Hallie Flanagan (Cherry Jones)was testifying before the Dies Committee, it came across that the right wingers, Congressman Dies  (Harris Yulin) and Congressman Starnes (Gil Robbins), would have censored Shakespeare, if they would have been around in his day. One of the themes of this movie is that the most terrifying thing to the powers, the Mr. Big's, the character in Blitzstein's play, of the world is the mass of folks having acess to uncensored and unfettered information. The movie takes a look at the hardtimes that were the reality, by showing how Olive Stanton, was existing or not existing at the start of the movie. The masses of people who were out in the street for no fault of their own. It also takes a poke at myths, when Marc Blitstein (Hank Azaria) is queried about his politics, if he has ever been a member of the Communist Party. He answers, I  believe in their social issues, but cannot be a member of  the party , because I am a homosexual. The party will not allow homosexuals to be members. So much for egalitarianism amongst the comrades. This is also taken a step further with Tommy Crickshaw (Bill Murray), a vaudeville ventriloquist and his students, Sid (Jack Black) and Larry (Kyle Gass); Crickshaw thinks that they are communists and when he accuses them of this, they say, We are not communists, we' re gay. Tim Robbins has carried on the tradition of Hallie Flanagan and the Federal Theatre Project in this movie, because it is truly a great film, that makes you think.

Because I viewed it today for the first time, I cannot yet give it a 10, but further attention might change my mind.  There was so much to absorb.  Previous comments have pointed out most of those wonderful attributes intellect, satire, important topics for discussion, etc.  It is clear that a lot of thought went into this film.  I guess that's what I liked the most a great deal of intellectual thought went into it--something that so many of today's movies don't seem to have.  I found the montage aspect somewhat unsettling at first, but the various strands in the web did come together well by the end.  The end is the aspect on which I wish to focus in this comment.Remember the famous ending shot from Planet of the Apes, in which Taylor (Charlton Heston) looks up from the beach and sees the Statue of Liberty sticking out of the sand?  That scene brought home the whole truth to us in the audience.  Yes, it can happen here!  (In the case of that movie, nuclear destruction.)  The movie prompted us to constant vigilance against such a threat (or acceptance that we have no control over fate, if you prefer).My emotional response was similar when I watched the parting shot of Cradle Will Rock.  Note that the final scene is TODAY, not the thirties!  (It is also loaded with symbolism.)  First we witness the applause and joy after the play, followed by the interspersing of three separate (but connected) scenes the dancing players and their audience (with three young children prophetically shouting the cradle will rock), the funeral procession of clowns carrying the casket of the dummy (bearing the sign Federal Theatre. Born 1934; Died 1937. Killed by an act of Congress.), and the scene of the destroyed Rivera mural (focusing on the one remaining piece the syphilis cell, which Rivera claimed represented the decadent rich) and its three bored, indifferent workmen, who are resting after the destruction.  The final scene is of the funeral procession moving from a dark street of the past into a busy, brightly lit city street of today.  The parting shot is of that present scene.  First we see a vending box labeled USA Today, then a crowded sidewalk and street, with a red light and walk sign in the center.  The first car in our focus is an NYPD cruiser, followed by yellow taxis.  Then the camera focuses on an array of huge, brightly lit signboards and logos Sony Theaters, Hertz, Marriott Marquis, Kodak, Maxell, Suntory Whisky, and others.  To the left side of the screen are two American flags.  Another sign, high above the flags says Prove It.  I found this scene almost as profound as the aforementioned scene from Planet of the Apes.  I thought it was such a major point in the movie.  It seemed to be trying to prompt us to constant vigilance against an imbalance of power (or to accept the blowing winds of fate).  Or perhaps I simply read a lot into it.Digging deeper, I noted that the three scenes each have significant threes three children, three apathetic workmen, three dummies (puppets).  The children might represent possibilities for the future, young instruments ready to be filled with knowledge and understanding.  They are linked symbolically with the open-minded bohemian artists.  The three dummies (one wooden puppet and two actors representing puppets) represent people, especially ignorant people who allow themselves to be manipulated.  They are symbolically linked with death.  The three workmen symbolize apathy in the shape of human drones who perform their work without thinking about what they are doing.  Interestingly, the workmen managed to destroy all of the mural except the syphilis cell representing the decadent rich.  Their apathy frees them from caring that they are allowing the decadent rich to manipulate them and others.  Also interestingly, Rockefeller (John Cusack) refers to the cell as a bubonic plague cell.I thought most of the characters were deliberately painted as gross caricatures, while Diego Rivera, the artist, was portrayed much more carefully--let's say he was a more careful, serious caricature.  Important were his arguments about his art as a political statement in the face of using his art to please someone for financial gain.  Today it seems that all art, all literature, all science, all law, everything is simply a commodity to be bought and sold.  The prostitution of art (and everything else, particularly the media) is such an important aspect of this film.In one scene Rivera is explaining his mural to Rockefeller.  Among the various items is a representation of television.  Rivera says, Television...beamed visual radio!  Imagine the potential for education!  Television, in this statement, might represent the various media, in the Aristotelian sense that the purpose of art is to educate and enlighten.  Today's media, represented in the final shot of giant signboards and logos, have woefully failed to educate, though they have made masses of people into apathetic puppets and dummies, and they certainly have made a lot of money while failing to educate.The winners in the film seem to be those who remain open-minded (such as the children and bohemian artists) and do not allow themselves to be manipulated (like the puppets) or apathetic (like the workmen).  At any rate, profound or not, Cradle Will Rock is a provocative, intellectual film, worth a second, more careful examination.

Oftentimes, the images on screen seem like part of a stream of consciousness, especially scenes when we take a look into the creative process of the playwright Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria). The style aside, I found the subject matter quite intriguing. The film reminded me of those high-school studies of the anti-Communist crusades of the 30's and 40's, and I was fascinated by the various ways in which the prevalent political sentiment of the day touched the lives of different people practising different forms of art and human expression.After warming up to the film's unconventional style, I was able to derive some enjoyment out of it. I do wish, though, that more time was given to character development (not an easy task, I realize, with the number of characters in the movie). I could envision this as a three-hour movie or even a mini-series. More solid character development would've probably given more impact to the film's ending, which seemed a little bit contrived and didn't attain the climactic feel that a moviemaker would seek.

The musical and the entire FTP come under fire when an employee testifies before Congress about the alleged Communist themes of the plays. Around the same time, Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) is all too willing to pay artist Diego Rivera (Ruben Blades) to paint a mural for Rockefeller Center's lobby until he sees the finished product.

First lesson in hanging out with the Off-Broadway crowd know your history &#150; or at least have a taste for the avant garde. This is the main subject of Cradle Will Rock an avant garde political-musical-play that apparently was ineffective in its attempt to smooth its subject matter, including some intricate socioeconomic issues, into an accessible enough Broadway libretto and tunes. Even in its own day, the original musical lacked enough talent to win audiences approval. It died in its first week, not from a witch hunt as Robbins' film suggests, but from lack of theatrical quality. This part of history was changed in order to convey how strongly all of us liberals feel about the socioeconomic events of that time and to reveal the ultimate cultural importance of the play. Funny how a relatively mediocre play with the right socioeconomic ideology became the greatest sleeper musical of the 20th century. It literally gave birth to Off-Broadway, an important sub-culture of the genre that has since provided opportunity and respect for countless talented theater play writers, songwriters, actors etc. through the years.Whether or not you will like this film really comes down to a matter of acquired taste in two main areas liberal politics & the avant garde style of Off-Broadway musical plays. In sparing those of us who are not Broadway inclined, Robbins spruced & edited Blitzstein's semi-atonal songs. Then fast paced film editing a la Fellini was applied, and this actually lent very well to a film based on an avant garde musical play, its economically subversive producers and corporate/political conspiracy to suppress them.A lot of critics hated the Orson Wells character treatment. To me, his character was one of the most entertaining. My favorite line was when Wells eludes to the weakness within the concept of cutting songs into what otherwise would be a perfectly good play. Rock is filled to the brim with satire of this sort, maligning itself like only a good intellectual liberal is capable. There are layers upon layers of intelligent social criticism interlaced within a complex labyrinth of misanthropy and hypocrisy all played upon a socioeconomic backdrop. All the brightness and quick dark wit of behind the scenes Broadway production is here presented with a twist of Fellini. It's a perfect match, and it's surprising that Robbins didn't receive Academy awards for this achievement. The reason, however, may be found again in the difficulty of swallowing Blitzstein's strange musical play, particularly in how it combines sober socioeconomic issues with peppy Broadway songs. One must acquire a taste for this kind of performing art. Its intricate, often interlacing musical & dramatic applications are fascinating on their own, without the politics. For this, Blitzstein deserves historic recognition, for he veritably founded a sub-genre, if without trying. Yet such recognition would not exist without the fact of this play's political timing. The myth of its failure as a result of capitalistic suppression supersedes the truth that it was basically a weak work. This is actually appropriate, as hypocritical as it may sound. For when it comes to alternative art, politics often is more important than the actual talent of the art. Finally, there is tragedy within this twisting hypocrisy as we witness the failure of a virtuoso ventriloquist because his politics are wrong. This deeply complex & dark character study alone lifts the film to classic status. It is very rare to see a contemporary film touch on an issue so dark & deeply, complexly  human. One is reminded of Bogart parts, or of Ernest Borgnine in Marty.The liberalism, freedom fighting etc. in Rock is moving and deliciously provoking. The casting impeccable. The history lesson is enticing at least this writer into studying more on the subject, which is probably the most important element in releasing such a film into the entertainment mainstream. But far surpassing any of these fine achievements is the appearance of one of the greatest supporting parts to ever be played in the history of films. That is Bill Murray's ventriloquist. It is one of the finest casting choices of all time. Rod Serling & others discovered long ago an unique aspect of dark horror the dramatic power that is attained by reaching into the macabre inner life of a vaudiville ventriloquist. Such a part is reserved for only the finest of character actors. Murray has revealed himself to be such an actor, and this fact is nothing short of a film revelation. As I watched Murray soak up the part with a finesse that could only be described as natural genius, I began to wish that this character was the lead. Murray's career needs such a lead part, in terms of dramatic integrity, like Jackie Gleason needed to play Gigot. I anxiously await for the day Murray's face shows up again on my local theater screen playing such a humbly sentimental, seriously dramatic & darkly ironic character, this time hopefully in a lead part. Until then, I'll have this, his Tommy Crickshaw, which literally stole the show.

The WPA theatrical project which supported Orson Welles and John Houseman in their early stages is wonderful material for dramatizing.  It is also, to my knowledge, an area which has previously received little dramatic treatment.However, the stylistic approach Writer-director Tim Robbins has chosen is a daringly personal one.  He must rise or fall on his often overblown theatricality by virtue of the individual viewer's taste. Personally, while I appreciated his patchwork collage approach, the presentation tended to emerge with a somewhat hollow and nebulous center.  Many scenes went by so fast that the actors could only convey external work.  Characters were often shouting at the top of the lungs at one another or whispering so softly as to almost be almost unintelligible.  It was as though the heart was missing from Robbin's realization of his own script.Perhaps the Super 35 image in theaters went a long way in supporting this presentation.  Unfortnately, I viewed it on home video and, in all fairness, this may have been a detriment to its inherent impact.Still, the concept was a good one, particularly using Marc Blizstein's score as the take-off point.

But that does not, in and of itself, make a good movie. Here, in fact, it makes an bad one. A shamefully bad one.First off, the movie has no heart, no center. There's lots of stories, but little actual character development. You never get to know these people as people. What you get is lots of wooden  dialogue where everyone reveals their political leanings. You get some potentially interesting stuff-John Turturro, Emily Watson, and John Cusack provide some humanity-but its lost in lots of clunky overbaked drama. For instance, poor Hank Azaria plays the guy who writes the title play, and all you see of him is a few scenes of him interacting with the ghosts of his past. You never get to know him beyond these scenes. These ghosts are a lady in a bride's dress and a European Kurt Weill-type fellow. You have to see these scenes to understand. They're staged in a goofy theatrical way, but that kind of hammy experimental theatre that makes you hate all theatre people. They made me giggle and feel shame. Deep shame. Which brings up another pointThe movie turns into a bad European film all the time. I'm not slamming European films as a whole. I have seen many a fine moving film from the Continent. Europeans in these wonderful films seem to have a deeper emotional capacity Americans are unfamiliar with, like the rules of soccer. I'm talking about the kind of cold, weird, artsy, stylized, whimsical, clown-filled European films that steer most of America towards Bruce Willis movies. This film takes on that tone over and over. I mean, you have a scene approaching some level of actual emotion, and wham! Clowns! Whimsy! Overacting! The last sequence of the movie is a procession of vaudeville performers-its dirty with clowns, I tell you!-bearing a coffin of a ventriloquist dummy through the streets! Merde! Shame!Let me talk about the performances. We have a lot of good actors in the movie. Some of them do well. Some do not. Most of the performances here are irritating. Vanessa Redgrave acts like Lovey from Gilligan's Island for most of the movie, then gets caught up in the cause at the end and gets so full of the joy of life, I wanted to bludgeon her. Paul Giamatti is actually annoying, no small feat for this wonderful actor. But, I don't blame these actors. They were directed to be over the top and cartoony. Two exceptions. Angus MacFayden as Orson Welles and Cary Elwes as John Houseman. Orson Welles was a serious, intense, charming visionary, not an overblown buffoonish chimp. Cary Elwes- how do you get work? Seriously. Deep shame!Finally-as I have worked myself into a froth-I blame Tim Robbins. He wrote and directed this sucker. Wrote the bad dialogue. Directed the horribly executed scenes. And his wife sings over the ending credits. The movie was obviously his pet project. That's always a scary prospect. Good directors can go bad really fast with pet projects. Steven Spielberg with ALWAYS and HOOK. John Boorman with WHERE THE HEART IS. Kevin Costner with THE POSTMAN(he sings over the end credits!).

During the Depression, there was a government funded theater program, created to give work to professional actors, and to make live theater affordable for the average person.  The story revolves around a pro-union musical, `The Cradle Will Rock,' written by Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria), to be produced with government funds, and directed by Orson Welles (Angus MacFadyen).  At the same time, there is concern about possible Communist infiltration of the program, and a Senate sub-committee begins hearings in an effort to root out the `Reds.'  This witch-hunt precursor to the infamous McCarthy hearings brought about the closing of the show before it ever opened.  The theater in which it was to be staged was closed down, and the actors forbidden (under union sanction) to take the stage anywhere else in order to perform this show; and it all came down on the eve of opening day.  Welles and company managed to secure a venue anyway, with the idea that Blitzstein (who was not a union member) would play piano and perform the entire show himself.  And for this one performance, the entire cast was seated in the audience to watch, and give Blitzstein some moral support.  Near the beginning, when he falters, one of the actresses, Olive Stanton (Emily Watson), rises from her seat and begins singing her part; and, one by one, the rest of the cast follows suit, until the entire show is performed by the actors from their places in the audience. This project was obviously a labor of love for Robbins, as a statement against censorship, as well as to illustrate the tyrannical embolisms that can be caused by fear.  Unfortunately, he takes this opportunity to make other statements as well, involving the politics of big business, and of wealth, and how it all tied in, and still does, with business as usual in Washington today.  And, though his stand is well-taken, to anyone not quite up to speed with their history, at least concerning this particular facet of the Depression, the story just seems to cover too much ground in too short a time.  True, the events enacted here are significant, and they do tie in with the funding of the theater program, but the story of the show, of Welles, of all the other members of the cast, and everything that went into it, was enough story for the movie on its own; but, perhaps, that movie wouldn't have made the impact Robbins had set out to make.  As it is, `Cradle Will Rock' is fairly entertaining, but to actually learn anything from it, one would have to make a number of cross-references first, before making any conclusions (There is a disclaimer at the beginning of the film, which states that the following is `partly true'). There are some notable performances here, particularly Azaria, John Turturro (Aldo), and Cherry Jones (Hallie Flanagan).  Hopelessly miscast are MacFadyen, who is made to bear a strong physical resemblance to Welles, but who lacks that distinctive voice, and Cary Elwes as John Houseman; in both instances, their performances are no more than impersonations, and the actors never really get to the soul of the men they are portraying, who ultimately become nothing more than boldly drawn caricatures.  John Cusack, it must also be noted, was less than credible as Nelson Rockefeller.  The supporting cast includes Joan Cusack (Hazel), Ruben Blades (Diego Rivera), Susan Sarandon (Margherita), Vanessa Redgrave (Countess LaGrange), Bill Murray (Crickshaw), Philip Baker Hall (Gray Mathers) and Jamey Sheridan (John).  Robbins must be given credit for making a noble effort with `Cradle Will Rock,' and it does shed some light on an important moment in the history of the theater; but in the end, it all seems just a bit too diverse for it's own good.

Robbins has chosen to present the aborted production  of Marc Blitzstein's Cradle Will Rock in a 1930's agit-prop style (with some allowances for contemporary irony)that takes a little indulgence on the viewer's part.  But the cast is marvellous, especially Bill Murray as a drunken ventriloquist, Vanessa Redgrave doing a star turn as an OTT parlour pink, and John Turturro as a working-class Italian actor.  Susan Sarandon is pretty good too, though the accent needs some work.  Whatever shortcomings the middle of the film may have (like almost all films, it is too long), the ending is smashing, beginning with the Dies committee hearings and ending with the wild-cat production of Blitzstein's Cradle.  Robbins wants to remind us what real theatre can do; the wide shot at the end, pulling away to modern Broadway, reminds us of what it doesn't.

While it espouses many liberal values, I don't agree with what many said, that only liberals would enjoy/appreciate the film and that it was a self-serving, self-important liberal tool. Cradle had a powerful message, and it is only if you missed the message that you would view it as self-important.Hank Azaria, John Turturro, Emily Watson, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, and Cherry Jones, especially, were excellent.To sum up, this film is very well done and gives good glimpses both at Blitzstein's great show and an era of social and economic turmoil.

Curses on his head, though, for producing such a sentimental postcard of what should have been a pageant.Robbins is certainly ambitious, presenting a dozen or so characters -- some lifted from history (Nelson Rockefeller, Orson Welles, John Houseman) and others created for the story -- and following them through as they commission or support or patronize or, for the most part, create socially-relevant works of art.  In a more experienced director's hands, this would have been a sweeping and crisp production.Unfortunately, CRADLE WILL ROCK slogs along with a list, with some of the character played straight (John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray, John Turturro, Emily Watson) and some of the character weirdly two-dimensional and cartoonish, such as Houseman and Welles, as well as the Vanessa Redgrave character.  The Houseman and Welles scenes are particularly disastrous, as the two actors, Angus MacFadyn and Cary Elwes, lurch and mug and cut up, but never bring a real dimension to two of the great personalities of American stage and film.Worse, the film is sluggishly paced, and Robbins' camera work is unimaginative.  The opening tracking shot is, in particular, way too long, too uniform and uninteresting.  The script, also by Robbins, never gives its characters (other than Ruben Blades, as Diego Rivera, and Cherry Jones as the Theater Project director) any real passion for their work, other than the clownish passion exhibited by Welles and Houseman.  What they want, what they're willing to fight for, never is fully presented in the story, thus draining the brash ending of any impact.Note  Susan Sarandon is absolutely awful in this film.A great subject to film, but sadly, a big swing and a miss.

It is certainly thought-provoking, and Cherry Jones is infinitely watchable, as is Vanessa Redgrave; in fact, there isn't a Bad Performance in the film. However, I have to take issue with a handful of smallish issues that I couldn't avoid noticing.First of all, I think it helps to know a bit about the art and politics of the 1930s before anyone even thinks of seeing this film, if only because of the little textures thrown in which Tim Robbins and his production crew so obviously labored over -- the relationship between Diego Rivera and Freida Kahlo, Nelson Rockefeller discussing the future of art with William Randolph Hearst while Orson Welles is throwing a play downtown -- and it is these details which help the film rise above itself. I have never seen Robbins' other directorial efforts (Bob Roberts and Dead Man Walking), but I will say that he has a bit of an obviousness to his style. Subtlety is forsaken in honor of Symbolism and Irony that are planted so as to be immutable to the audience -- possibly to balance the great historical detail that may be lost on the underinformed.My greatest beef with the film comes from the fact that Angus McFadyen plays Orson Welles. Not that I have anything against McFadyen, who is normally a fine actor, but apparently someone thought it wise to play a good majority of the historical figures in this movie, Welles included, as cartoons of themselves, quite one-dimensional. Welles comes off as A Character, not a genius, which he is alleged to be in most accounts, and McFadyen seems to let a hint of an accent slip into some of his lines, which is probably unavoidable. What was avoidable is the fact that in 1936 Welles was 21, and McFadyen certainly doesn't pass for his 20s, period. It seems odd to me that Robbins would choose to overlook a large detail like that in favor of aestheticism.Still, beyond all of its minor successes and flaws, Cradle Will Rock is an ultimately satisfying film if only because of its final twenty minutes. After all of the hardships fought to be able to put on the title play, the actors involved do a spectacular job of pulling it together, even if they will only ever get to do it once. Hank Azaria is wonderful as Marc Blitzstein, the playwright in question, and the scene as a whole is inspiring even to those who don't create art for a living. The film succeeds in its one goal to make us as the modern society aware of the importance of art and freedom of expression, and reminds us just how far we've strayed from those ideals in this modern world.

It will educate you on the constant struggle between the creative process and the people who control what artist can do.   And it will dramatize the power of stereotyping groups into order to perpetuate social conflicts and barriers.  That Tim Robbins accomplishes this while presenting an unevenly paced and, at times, tangential film is a tribute to his fine ensemble of actors (John Turturo, Emily Watson, Ruben Blades,  Susan Sarandon, Vanessa Redgrave, Angus MacFayden as a dead-ringer for Orson Welles, and a nice cameo by Barnard Hughes) and to a clear and unwavering theme.  We may not appreciate fascism, communism, Mussolini's big lie, capitalism, and unionism presented in Cradle Will Rock.  Nor the significance of men like Diego Rivera, Nelson Rockefeller,  Harry Hopkins, William Randolph Hearst, John Houseman, or Orson Welles.  Happily, historical figures and terms serve only as starting points in a film that blatantly reminds us that exhibitions of art are very much the result of political and societal dictates rather than the truer expressions they were intended.  The fight over exhibiting lewd forms of art at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the virtual abdication of the National Endowment for the Arts to Congress are just two recent examples.  Cradle Will Rock uses the fight for control of the Federal Theater Project in the 1930s to show how a well intended enterprise can be waylaid by the people who control its purse strings.  This is dramatized so well in the scene in which Rockefeller and two other moguls dress up for a French costume ball as royal nobility as they discuss how they will only be funding art  that fit their conservative tastes.   The interaction between the ventriloquist, Tommy Crickshaw (understated by Bill Murray) and the Ms. Do-Right character, Hazel Hoffman (aptly played by Joan Cusak)  is a poignant reminder of how people can be mislaid by believing in labels and the betrayal of truth that results.   Cradle Will Rock makes a powerful case for artistic freedom and , given another round of editing, would have been an even better film.

He takes on a whole lot more than just Welles, however, and Cradle Will Rock emerges as a timely and captivating story of the dangerous web woven when art, commerce and politics mix.The Cradle Will Rock was originally slated to be a production mounted by the Federal Theater Project, a government-funded arts coalition which gave unemployed theatricals jobs during the Depression.  However, like many other people's groups during this period, the FTP eventually fell under suspicion of Communist leanings, and the feds locked the theater prior to Cradle's opening show.  That didn't stop its director, Welles, and its producer, John Houseman, from marching the whole cast and crew twenty-one blocks to another theater, where the composer, Marc Blitzstein, played the score from the stage while the actors performed from the seats (thereby saving their union status and keeping their jobs).This story is intercut with the conflict between fatcat-in-training Nelson Rockefeller and left-leaning artist Diego Rivera, who is hired to paint a mural for the lobby of Rockefeller Center under the false pretenses that he will be permitted to express himself.  It was a scary time in America in many ways.  Artists were being shut down and blackballed for expressing the threatening philosophy that the working man should be entitled to his fair share.  The government found Communists in every backyard, and ruined many decent people's lives, while the rich businessmen who kept the politicos in office were free to hobnob with Hitler and Mussolini for the sake of their business interests.  It was the only time in American history when arts projects were fully supported by the government, and the results show that artists should probably never put their fate into federal hands again.   It's a lot for one story to tackle, and great credit goes to Robbins for keeping it all clear, interesting, and immensely entertaining.  He shows a style and verve here that his previous two films, for all their skill, lacked.  He's like Robert Altman crossed with Woody Allen here, and his elegant, confident work should not be ignored at Oscar time.  The film breathes with authenticity, and the cinematography of Jean Yves Escoffier glimmers.Still, the true hats are off to the superb ensemble cast, who take what could have been an intriguing but staid history lesson and truly engage us in the roiling emotions of the people involved.  All are superb, but special mention goes to Bill Murray, whose work as a Red-hating ventriloquist who falls hard for a like-minded government worker surpasses his turn in Rushmore, Angus Macfadyen, who has a ball playing Welles as a loud but exuberant perpetual showman, John Turturro, who dazzles as a proud FTP actor, and especially Vanessa Redgrave, who turns in a zesty comic performance as a countess whose marriage to a gladhanding steel tycoon hasn't dulled her revolutionary zeal.Rudolph Giuliani, Jesse Helms, and the entire federal government should be sent on a field trip to see Cradle Will Rock.  Not only will they be supremely entertained, but they might take something away with them that will help us all in the long run.

The flow is awful.  Only the last scene and a few other scenes spread throughout the film are adequately paced and left to develop and sink in.  Otherwise, Robbins was too busy trying to make as many continuous shots as possible and working with the actors, instead of making sure that every scene worked well and hooked in emotionally.  So we are left feeling detached, or abandoning a scene before we are ready to do so.  It's a shame.  I particularly felt sorry for the scene were the crowd is marching to the new theater.  It should have been a key scene, but wound up being nothing.  Ironically, the fast speed made the film feel slow and made it soporific by moments.Overall, the stories and the characters were underdevelop.  Similarly, the film's main discussion, the prostitution of the artist, is left only slightly deeper than the superficial level.Still, the film is not bad.  There are a couple of good scenes there, and a lot of good dialogue and great performances. But wait for it to pop up on video or TV.

However traditional union stubbornness is also frowned upon in the movie.The movie tries to see the events and the multitude of characters involved from a sort of detached perspective which makes it a little bit difficult to get close to any of the characters. Many of the side-stories (at least 8) could easily occupy an entire movie of its own, but I give credit for the effort in trying to tie it all together.For me the Rivera versus Rockefeller part is the most poignant - That Rockefeller could even think that hiring a well-known socialist sympathizer as Rivera without doing something subversive is just both hilariously funny and naive. One could argue that making the joke a little bit less obvious would have saved a great piece of art, but I guess thats very typical of many artists.All in all a very fascinating slice of a time-period, but a little bit too fragmented to really score a bullseye in my view.

The central theme of Cradle Will Rock is the Federal Theater Project, sponsored by the WPA, to bring low cost theater to the masses, especially the unemployed. One project is a musical, The Cradle Will Rock, written by Hank Azaria's character, and because of its controversy is having a tough time finding a theater that will allow it to be shown.  In a perfect, magnificent scene near the end, Azaria alone with his piano on stage is set to do a one-man show. However, as it progresses, one-by-one audience members, who had trained for the various parts, stood up and performed their parts amongst the ordinary theater goers.  It was done so well it did not seems like a dramatization. Human spirit again triumphs over regulation.Tim Robbins, who I remember mostly for roles like Merlin (Top Gun) and Ed (I.Q.), is one of the most talented writer/directors, as he showed previously in Dead Man Walking and Bob Roberts. His use of the moving camera in selected scenes puts the viewer right into the action. Example, early on, the camera follows Turturro and his kids out of a taxi and across the street, then seemlessly picks up Emily Watson standing in the employment line, then later picks up Ms Flannagan as she walks past and into the employment building, always picking up the right voices to go along with the shot.The film is full of top drawer actors. Emily Watson, a Brit, plays an American singer out of work, becomes a stagehand, eventually gets the role of the prostitute in Cradle even though her singing is very marginal. Ruben Blades is a painter commissioned by Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack) to paint a large mural in his new building, it is eventually torn down because the artist insisted on having Stalin displayed prominently.Orson Welles at 21, 5 years before Citizen Kane, is played ably by Scottsman Angus MacFadyen. Bill Murray is great as the ventriloquist who must try and teach two no-talents. Also Joan Cusack, Susan Sarandon, John Turturro, Vanessa Redgrave.Overall a very enjoyable film that goes by more quickly that its 2+ hours.

The final, silent, frames are the most moving and perhaps, in implication, the most radical.Tim Robbins is to be admired for creating a fresh and truly original script (the scenes in which Marc Blitzstein communes with the ghosts of Brecht and his late wife are just some of the script's high points).  Had this been a first time script by some unknown talent, it would be surprising enough.  That it comes from a name actor is somehow more surprising (who knew he had it in him?).  Robbins should be nominated for an Academy award, but of course he won't be.  Most of the cast, from the Cusak siblings, to Bill Murray, to Carrey Elwes (and his dead-on John Houseman impression) is well chosen.

But he did, and now believes what Joe Roth, Disney's studio chief, probably apparently told him that the studio loves the movie.

Tim Robbins has given us an excellent reminder of the urgency for vigilance in protecting artistic expressions that grate against the all-too-well protected status quo. Experimentalism in art inspires people to explore their personal and universal worlds - that's why it is dangerous to those making money off the norm. It is as true today as it was in 1936. It is up to artists and those who love art in all its forms to put themselves on the line - as everyone involved in the impromptu production of the original Cradle Will Rock event did.

It's a very clever script, and despite what I've read from many other user comments, I think that the multi-character storytelling is done as well as one possibly could. It's necessary for a film that talks about art vs. politics during the tumultuous 1930s to cite more than one example of the universal (and in today's Hollywood system, still relevant) truth of art, creativity, integrity, commerce and politics. One thing that I've read in both the negative and positive reviews that bothers me is everyone's complaining about the portrayals of Orson Welles and John Houseman by Angus MacFadyen and Cary Elwes, respectively. Many people have commented that Welles' genius is not given a fair shake, being overshadowed by his arrogance and drunken foolishness. Here is where we should commend Tim Robbins and Angus MacFadyen more than ever! The simple fact is that during this time, Orson Welles' theatre work was lessened by his involvement in radio, he was taking on more projects than he could handle, and once he left New York after his War of the Worlds broadcast in 1938, his theatre WAS in a great shambles. Aside from the legendary voodoo Macbeth, and his Julius Caesar set against the backdrop of the Nuremberg Festival, much of Welles' theatre work in NY was not of great success, and often worked through chaos, sometimes to disastrous results. So, rather than choosing to skew the truth by showing the genius of Welles that orchestrated War of the Worlds, and made Citizen Kane and Chimes at Midnight, Tim Robbins chose to be honest and show us the Orson Welles who drank a bottle of scotch each night with his dinner as he tried to barely keep his edgy productions from falling under. I'm an ENORMOUS admirer of Orson's; as a director, he is my hero and mentor. So, I'm just as sensitive about issues involving him as anyone.The other major complaint is regarding the politics. That this is so liberal minded it's impossible to watch. First off, if you are a right-wing conservative and/or republican minded person, you will never like this film, even if you gave it the benefit of the doubt. Secondly, this is pointing at a time in history when the House Un-American Activities Committee was notoriously responsible for propaganda fueled by paranoia, and many artists suffered. Quite simply put, this story happened, and Tim Robbins is just interpreting it onto the screen. And I feel he's done a magnificent job in doing so.  "}{"Title":"A Great 'Historical'Film.

Robbins does assume that his audience has a firm grasp of historical figures and events, this can be a problem at times but it serves as an encouragement to the viewer to maybe pick up a history book or two and there's nothing wrong with that.Viewers shouldn't expect a long and boring history lesson in this movie, it is still fantastically entertaining. . .and why can't films be political??

To counter this the Government pours money into employment programmes &#150; one of which is funding theatre projects to create jobs and supply subsidised entertainment to the masses. However it is also a time of fear and suspicion &#150; with Communist being the worst insult around. It is at this time that Marc Blitzstein writes a play about a prostitute and an Union organiser in Steel Town. Of course, while writing alone in his home with only his dead wife and the spirit of Brecht for company, he was not to know the significance that the play would come to have.Although it is perhaps too fictionalised to be of use as a historical piece, Robbins' labour of love is a jauntily entertaining ensemble piece that does a great deal well and very little badly. The plot is about the events leading up to and surrounding Orson Welles and John Houseman's staging of Marc Blitzstein's Federal Theatre Musical in the face of great unemployment, tantrums and the accusations of communism. The script makes the whole thing look effortless but it is far from being that; actually it could easily have been a mess with so many plot strands and characters, but it works very well, keeping each interesting, engaging and, surprisingly, lively, amusing and entertaining. It is hard to describe but it does work pretty well. The downside of this is that, no matter how well it does it, the actual focal point of the film is a subtext rather than part of the narrative (although it does try to put the play at the core of things by messing with the timeline) and this will be a problem to audiences that don't often see this. However, Robbins opinions of art and censorship are clear and it does make for an engaging meaning to the story.Robbins shows his skill with a fine opening five or so minutes of good camera movement and shot framing. After this he keeps up the real quality feel but is never obtrusive. He also manages to capture a real sense of time and place &#150; in the writing and directing. The cast is deep and they all work well together, easily taking to the ensemble feel in the script. Azaria works well with his character; the Cusacks are both good; Elwes is enjoyable; Murray produces a darkly comic performance; Hall is good; Sarandon is solid enough; Redgrave is colourful; Turturro is good; Macfafyen's Welles is convincing and enjoyable; Blades is convincing and so on &#150; I could talk about each actor because they were all good. The only problem with their performances is that, with so many people and characters, few have the chance to go deeper than the pacey delivery permits.Overall an enjoyable and interesting film that is surprisingly entertaining even if it is, understandably, a bit stagy. Some have commented on the length of the film but for my money there is so much happening in the story that to cut any more of it would have been very difficult. The direction is great and the cast all take to the ensemble script like ducks to water- more than making up for the fact that the film never looks too hard at any one character for too long.

Only about 30 out of 40 were still in there seats at the end. We kept hoping for a real coming together since we really didn't know how much This movie is (Mostly) a true Story. really meant.  Colorful, Chaotic, wild, provocative but a bit too much trying to figure out where the movie might take you.  Hard to take with the singing too since most of the cast really couldn't sing.Read up on the whole story before you see it.  I might help....

In fact, it was so awful that it doesn't deserve to be reviewed. There is only one positive thing that came from watching this movie; telling other prospective viewers that Cradle Will Rock is a waste of time and money.There were many things about Cradle Will Rock in this film that I found to be terrible. However, there were two that stood out as the worst parts of the film. The first was the pointless storyline the writers came up with. The second were the performances of every actor involved with the making of this movie. I can hope that viewers will stay away from Cradle Will Rock.

You really do get the impression that director Tim Robbins has during the production of the movie been receiving phone calls from his socially aware friends pleading politely that they be given a part . Being a very nice man ( Has anyone ever said anything bad about Robbins the person ? ) the director hasn't had the cruel common sense to say  Sorry but we've got everything we need for the project  instead he's replied  Okay I'll get the writers to write you a part  This is the problem with CRADLE WILL ROCK . We could have had a very memorable biopic of Orson Welles as a struggling actor in a New York theatre company in the 1930s , or we could have had a movie pointing out that it wasn't just Joe McCarthy's UnAmerican congressional hearings that ruined artistic careers , but the whole storyline becomes swamped and ultimately drowned with little character episodes that don't really lead to a bigger picture . Of course some of the subplots will appeal to a lot of people and I was thoroughly entertained by the sub story of Bill Murray's ventriloquist act being stolen by the two homosexuals but you do find yourself wishing that your favourite sub story had taken up more screen time with other subplots being eliminated totally at script stage . A very good example of less being more "},{"Title":"What?????","Date":"17 January 2000","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  What was Tim thinking? This movie was a jumbled mess. He wasted some great talent on such a terrible script. Vanessa Redgrave, Em,John Turturro, and Joan Cusack gave excellent performances as usual. But Orson Welles and John Houseman must be turning over in their graves and the ridiculous caricatures that were imposed upon the audience by Angus Whatever and Cary Elwes. I was very disappointed!

Are they bad homages or assassinations masquerading as tributes? We seem to live in an age with a massive oedipal artistic complex. Hemingway & Stein reduced to simpering pedantic fools in The Moderns & here Welles & Rivera & Rockefeller reduced to late Saturday Nite Live skits. There's some kind of ideology at work here. Ideology of trivialization. Here's rooting for the next generation to rise & overthrow the Robbins/Sarandon mindless retro-liberal nexus.

It is offensive.Cradle Will Rock was a 1930's play put on by hardcore Leftists and outright Communists and was a pro-Labor anti-business load of sanctimonious AgitProp - agitation propaganda. And it would have been most suitable in Stalin's Russia  or the China of the Red Guards in the 1960's. Being publicly financed in the FDR administration it was to be closed down, but according to the Leftist Mythology they heroically fought the good fight and put the play on at another theater.So now we have the far-Leftists of 1990's Hollywood presenting a tedious and bloated salute and paean to New York theater Leftists and Communists of the 1930's. If you are of similar extreme political bent go watch it and slap yourself on the back. Everyone else, STAY AWAY and avoid the boredom of this pretentious and self-important movie!

A fine ensemble cast mostly goes through the motions of a very obvious agenda. Somehow, a populist urban polemic about McCarthyism set against the backdrop of public theater doesn't seem very relevant in 1999. The time-warping ending, presumably attempting to address qualms of appositeness, is laughably heavy-handed.
