This is one of my favorite movies ever and may be the best (not slapstick, Chris Farley-esque comedy, but smart) comedy.  You must pay attention to this movie to get the jokes, because most of them are running (as in recurring) jokes that pick up on items that may have been just mentioned once (Go you Huskies!) and again and again and again and then are explained later as a tag-on in the dialogue.  This basic comedy technique works on an early Mel Brooks type level and makes for a movie that should be watched many times in order to pick up everything, but is still (maybe even more) enjoyable after each viewing.The writing is unquestionably the best comedy screenplay since those early Brooks films.  It's just funny, but you have to pay attention.  If you aren't listening to every line of dialogue, you will miss jokes, it is that simple.  Each line is crucial to the script either as a story/plot building device or as a joke building device or both.  There is not one wasted word in the script.The cast is classic.  Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, plays the matter-of-fact-talking girl perfectly.  She is the heart of the film and deserves praise for being able to perform that well.  The other person that deserves high praise is William H. Macy.  His performance is on par with his Fargo performance.  He emits this sense of control as everything falls apart around him and delivers some excellent lines.Baldwin gives a better than average performance, as does Durning and Hoffman and the rest of the cast is quite good.The direction is great. The movie seems to last 15 minutes because it is that interesting and fast paced.  The perceived fast pace is created by the actors saying their lines so quickly and crisply. This  can only occur with a director that knows the script but since the script was written by the director, the point becomes moot.  Everything else also flows so well and the credit for that has to be given to Mamet's directing and writing ability.I really like this film.  I like the way The Old Mill mirrors the actions of the actual film and how deep the film goes.  This is like one of those classic novels that can be dissected in every way for symbolism and thought, which is quite rare in today's cinema.  The film may be too smart for it's own good and may have overshot the general movie audience, but makes for a gem of a movie to watch.  Mamet pulls no punches making fun of Hollywood by comparing it to small town America or more importantly Hollywood values to small town American values.  Watch this movie if you want to think and be entertained, and if that doesn't sound appealing, please go find another movie to watch.

It's very witty, very original and he has certain trademarks, like quick exchanges of dialogue between actors and repeating of the same sentence of dialogue in a group of lines.  Well, his uniqueness is quite evident in watching this movie and it works quite well.First I'll mention the vast array of talented actors.  I don't think the casting could've been any better.  Character actor William H. Macy is brilliant as the almost unscrupulous director, who will do ANYTHING--and I'm not exaggerating the least bit--to get his picture done.  Fellow character actor/fellow PT Anderson regular Philip Seymour-Hoffman turns in another brilliant, yet subtle performance as the shy but appealing and wildly creative screenwriter who is the fuel of this cinematic project.  As I said, he's made a significant--and extremely impressive--transition from playing the airhead jerk in Scent of a Woman and Twister to playing deep character roles like this.  He ranks among the top in my list of Best Underrated Actors (along with Macy) and I hope one of these days he'll become a household name.  David Peymer, I think, delivers the best performance of his career as the fast-talking, sniveling producer.  I've always known he was a good actor, but he truly flaunts his knack for acting and taking risks in this role.  It figures that playwright Mamet would assemble a group of fine character actors, instead of simply casting people who look good on camera.  That's one of the advantages of having a playwright as a director.The script is wildly original and kept me laughing.  There are many interesting, memorable quotes.  And this is just a fine adult comedy (Thank God!!).  With the explosion of teen gross-out comedies, I'm sure audiences will cherish a comedy like this.  It works in all aspects.  Not only is it well-performed, but it's well-written (lots of comedies only contain one of those factors).  And it's all done in good taste.  So those of you expecting cheap sex jokes and low-brow gags involving bodily functions--sorry to disappoint you!  There are no cliches.  This movie is an explosion of Mamet's gift for creativity.  Take for example, the relationship between Hoffman and the beautiful Rebecca Pidgeon.  They don't have a sex scene.  Most of their screen time is spent talking and getting to know each other, sharing their thoughts on writing, researching the town's history, finding out how much they have in common.  Do we still see that in the movies?  Character development in romance?  In the scene where Hoffman is in the hotel room with Sarah Jessica Parker lying on the bed naked, and Pidgeon knocks on his door to greet him with a bouquet of flowers, there's no predictability.  You would assume she would take one look at Parker's naked body and punch him in face.  I'm not going to give away what happens, but that moment stuck in my mind, because it is the first film I've seen to go a different route with the whole girlfriend catches you in bed with another girl premise.  State and Main is pleasant, light-hearted, funny, original comedy and it's one I'd definitely recommend.  If you want to see great performances and laugh at good, tasteful humor--you can't go wrong!My score  7 (out of 10)   "},{"Title":"David Mamet takes a change of pace","Date":"23 December 2000","Score":"20 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  If you know Mamet's film history, you'll realize often, he writes about lowlifes and depressing (though good) subject matter such as the Untouchables, Glengarry Glen Ross and The Winslow Boy.

There are dozens this year already by others (and about writing too) and this is an incredibly tight and multilayered edition, but the layers are different than usual.Once again, we get relatively deep ruminations on the nature of art. Here, the mirror of film and film-within is reflected in Hollywood and a `real' town. Lots of smaller reflections too -- for instance in the external film, breasts are shown to the lead but not the audience, while this same issue is manipulated in the internal film. Lots of plot turns, including some unconsummated starts who burned stuff down? why did it inspire the Huskies? what happened to 1975? Some truly great acting on the part of Hoffman and Macy. And the whole thing is funny as hell.But what's truly fascinating is how Mamet layered the meanings and how he placed his wife in the center. His past few films -- the ones he directed plus `Vanya' -- were incredibly multilayered. He creates parallel worlds which the actors jump among, sometimes chasing, or annotating, or fighting. Very rich, very jazz. But in the last two films Rebecca has been lost as an actress. She's really quite accomplished, but as a straight ahead sort of actor. Hoffman can play several roles at once -- Pidgeon only one.One can see that Mamet loves his levels -- it's the core of his achievement. But he loves his wife more. So here he has flattened his levels of abstraction so that they are not indirectly referenced but intrinsic in the story. That way, his wife can work with her role without being swamped. He even builds the entire creation of both films around her (she writes them both). And he adds a half-film of sorts where she creates her own, by mobilizing townspeople to fool Hoffman's character. More. With Hoffman as his surrogate he even makes the story about this bending of the story for her, about sacrificing artifice for love. What a valentine! How enobling a love! I'll bet his next writing/directing effort (`The Heist,' now in production) is similarly built on her.My only complaint continues to be his use of the camera, which is strictly mundane. His films are plays, all about the writing and acting, not at all about the filming in the filming. What will happen when Mamet's writing is seen through Ridley Scott's eye? We'll soon see.

The film is `State and Main,' written and directed by David Mamet, and arguably his best effort since 1987's `House Of Games.'  When a movie company invades the sleepy hamlet of Waterford, Vermont, for a location shoot, complete with big name stars Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin) and Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) in tow, it creates quite a stir; and before it's over many of the townsfolk, as well as a few of those connected with the film, have learned some things about themselves-- and others-- they never knew before.  Things about honesty, purity and the moral flexibility inherent in many of those who reside here on planet Earth. 	As a setting for the making of the film within the film-- which is about purity and second chances-- Mamet takes a page right out of Americana, complete with a Main Street, an historic firehouse, a quaint hostelry and even-- `maybe'-- an old mill on a stream.  And in making a film about making a film about purity and second chances, he's made a film about purity and, well, second chances; a terrific character study that is forthright and sincere, and which rings with truth from beginning to end.  It's as honest as it is real, and so accessible that it makes an instant connection with the audience.  There are characters and situations here with which everyone will be able to identify in one way or another, all presented refreshingly and quite unpredictably.  Just when you think you see something coming from a mile away, you're treated to one of those famous Mamet `twists' that take you exactly where you didn't think you were going.  And Mamet does it so well that it's not only highly entertaining, but invigorating as well. 	The cast he put together for this film is superlative, beginning with William H. Macy as Walt Price, the director of the movie.  A Mamet regular, Macy creates a character infused with that magic Mamet realism that helps establish the credibility of the film from the outset.  Baldwin is perfectly cast as the `star' with certain insatiable appetites and recreational needs, as is Parker, as the actress with a sudden case of `issues' regarding her contractual obligations.  And David Paymer does a solid turn as Marty Rossen, the producer of the film.  But the two actors who really make this movie tick are the charismatic Rebecca Pidgeon, and the versatile, multi-talented Philip Seymour Hoffman. 	Pidgeon is absolutely captivating as Ann Black, the local who runs the book shop and directs the town's drama group (which includes just about everybody in Waterford, it seems).  She's winsome and charming, with a directness and vigor that is stunning; and she captures the very essence of Ann-- the intelligence and the compassion-- and conveys it convincingly to the audience.  It's a memorable performance, and one of the strengths (among many) of the movie.  The real star of the show, however, is Hoffman, as Joseph Turner White, the writer of the movie.  He gives an introspective performance filled with nuance and subtlety that is so real-- so pure-- that he single-handedly takes the film to a whole new level.  Like Meryl Streep, Hoffman has that chameleon-like ability that enables him to be anyone and everyone, yet always unique; it's a quality with which few actors are endowed, and he uses his gift to full advantage here, with his memorable portrayal of White.  Simply put, it's a great performance by a great actor, and one that should earn him an Oscar nomination. 	The supporting cast includes Charles Durning (Mayor George Bailey), Clark Gregg (Doug), Patti LuPone (Sherry Bailey), Julia Stiles (Carla) and Ricky Jay (Jack).  Mamet has a style that make his films uniquely his own, and `State and Main' is one of his best.  Exceptionally well done and delivered, it's intelligent, funny and entertaining; an honest and succinct examination of human nature with an integrity at it's core that makes it a truly great film.  This is a prime example of what the magic of the movies is all about; a film that absolutely should not be missed.  I rate this one 10/10.

Meanwhile, everyone in town wants a piece of the movie's action, and they won't easily be discouraged from getting it.State and Main just might be David Mamet's funniest movie ever. Poking fun at both Tinseltown and the ideal small town, he creates a story that's as biting as it is zany.I have a question, though. Charles Durning plays Mayor George Bailey.

The storyline is thin and almost non-existent, it could be summed up as, everyone gets the chance to screw up a second time. Nevertheless, there are enough twists and turns to make what story there is interesting. This must be the sort of movie that every good actor and actress would love to have a role in as the screenplay has been written by an accomplished playwright. It is a farcical melodrama rather than a comedy but nonetheless highly enjoyable.A film-making team, hard up on critical funds, has just been thrown out of a small town in New Hampshire. Their movie's plot necessitates the choice of a small town New England locale and a water mill (one reason why they are short of funds is that they had to build an old water mill replica in the New Hampshire town). As the movie begins The Director and his crew find themselves in a small town in Vermont (actually most of the scenes are shot in Connecticut or Massachusetts). The beauty of the location is well-captured by excellent photography. The makers of State and Main did not fall into the trap of shooting the film during the Fall. New England fall colors would be a major distraction although Alfred Hitchcock's black comedy, The Trouble With Harry, succeeded despite being shot in Vermont at the peak of the fall leaf color season, but then Hitchcock was an exceptional genius.The small town has being going on in its leisurely way until the film crew arrive. The obvious star of State and Main is Philip Seymour Hoffman a previously little known Hollywood actor whose first appeared on the screen as the spoiled rich daddy-supported George Willis Jr. In that memorable Al Pacino film, Scent of a Woman. Hoffman's key role in State and Main is as the author and screen play writer for the movie within the movie. The better known Hollywood star Alec Baldwin plays the lesser role of the film-in making's male star. He is portrayed as a lustful male whose sexual preference is of under age nubile girls.The Director is played by William H. Macy, who is completely unflappable no matter what. The producer arrives after the crew has settled in. The role is played by droopy-eyed David Paymer, who is completely obsessed with money and will bribe anyone to get things moving. The male star lead is almost fatally distracted by a young teenager (Julia Stiles). The female lead and siren, Sarah Jessica Parker, demands substantial extra money for appearing naked in a scene claiming that she has found religion. Hoffman is smitten in the heart by an attractive young woman (Rebecca Pigeon) in the town who is engaged or semi-engaged to the local bad man and town councilor.I will leave it to the reader's imagination to find out if the film crew gets the second chance to screw up again. The movie is directed by David Mamet, a leading American playwright. Mamet wrote the screen plays for well-known movies such as The Postman Always Rings Twice, The Untouchables , and had a minor role as a performer in the 1986 thriller Black Widow. He has directed several movies aside from this one in the past 17 years.It is evident that Mamet , who also wrote the screen play for this charming melodrama, was at a loss for a suitable title for the film, just like the director in the play, who wanted to call his movie The Old Mill, only to find out, upon arrival in the Vermont town, that the much advertised Old Mill had burnt down in 1960. Mamet settled on the uninspiring title State and Main from the intersection where the town's brand new traffic lights still stand at the start of the movie. Interestingly enough the title for the DVD version of State and Main circulating in Greece is translated as Without Title. I am fairly confident that this little known 102 minute melodrama will become a cine buff's classic one day "},{"Title":"Goodhearted, light fun","Date":"23 June 2004","Score":"14 out of 18 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  In the pantheon of David Mamet's films, I'd say State and Main ranks somewhere in the middle, but it's a good middle. The rhythm and pace is more like a sitcom than a feature film, sharply edited and light on its feet and with a sort of whitebread jazz motif loitering in the background, but the cast is certainly above average, and Mamet's screenplay is very charming punctuated with some funny sub-plots and a few very good (maybe even great) one-liners.The story concerns a film production crew, running out of money, who blows into the quaint provincial town of Waterford, Vermont on a location shoot after getting run out of New Hampshire (for reasons that are very hush-hush). The wellspring of much of the humor is in the byplay between the corruptness of the film people and the purity of the locals, who turn out to be as rotten as some of the Hollywood crowd. There are also some hilarious insides on the world of show-biz and film-making (i.e. the associate producer's credit, the product placement for a dot.com in a movie set in the 1800's, the cinematographer who can't get the shot he wants, Sarah Jessica Parker's character who finds religion and won't show her breasts in the film - unless the producers pay her an additional 800 grand).Mamet is not quite in the Woody Allen class of gagwriting, but he proves to be assured and witty without being too self-consciously clever (as he is in Heist). Some favorite lines I remember my lines. I just don't remember which order they come in.; You don't like children, do you?

After the leading man's penchant for teenage girls gets them banished from their New Hampshire location, a film crew relocates to the small town of Waterford, Vermont, to finish shooting The Old Mill.As its title suggests, the film depends on the presence of a genuine mill, something the town is reported to possess. Unfortunately, with only days before principal photography begins, it becomes apparent that the mill in fact burned down decades ago. Unfazed, the film's director, Walt Price, places his faith in the ability of first-time screenwriter Joseph Turner White to alter the script; what he doesn't count on is White's apparently bottomless reserve of angst-fueled writer's block.The film's leading lady refuses to do her contracted nude scene unless she's paid an additional $800,000, while a foreign cinematographer offends the locals by messing with a historic firehouse. Meanwhile, the leading man, Bob Barrenger, dallies with Carla, a crafty local teen. Everything comes to a head after Barrenger and Carla are injured in a car accident, which leads White to another emotional quandary and into the arms of local bookseller Annie Black. Meanwhile a powerful movie producer comes to town to help Price with the ensuing mess.State and Main offers plenty of wit and laughs in its lampoons of the movie industry.It is the funniest and most accessible film to date by David Mamet, propelled by the rocket fuel of his showbiz experience and driven by an ensemble cast that simply couldn't be better. Naturally, the writer's dilemma is the meatiest one and he arrives at a solution that's as hilarious as it is morally justified. Along the way, the rigors of film making are explored with farcical abandon, such as how to provide a high-tech product placement in a 19th-century story. His razor-sharp dialogue is gourmet popcorn here--each kernel yields a tasty surprise--and the whole scenario plays out with the breezy assurance of vintage screwball comedy. It's pure gold from start to finish, and even the closing credits offer another reason to laugh.Obviously,the nice thing about it is that it won't disappoint the viewer.

The plot is tight, the dialogue is fast-paced, and the actors deliver with great precision and aplomb.Macy plays the director of a movie that has had to leave its earlier location for a reason that leaks out of the dialogue without ever being stated. And we watch as history repeats itself with the inevitability of history itself. Macy's character, Walt Price, is a lying, conniving, manipulative, unfeeling jerk that Macy keeps from being unlikeable by showing us that Walt _needs_ to be all those things to get the film in the can.Walt Price and his crew are trying to shoot a film in a small town in Vermont, where the residents are wowed by the attention. Mamet's script is a silent riot, as we see the rubes go from reading the local paper to Variety, all in the background, so if you're not paying attention to the background, you're missing a substantial part of the humor and foreshadowing of what's going to happen. Everything that can go wrong, does go wrong, so lawyers are brought in, cash is brought in, and love is brought in. Rebecca Pidgeon is great as the straight-faced, straight-talking love interest for Hoffman, and Hoffman delivers a great performance as Mamet -- the writer of art who gets the full Hollywood treatment and who must decide between love/art and seduction/corruption. As Hoffman's character keeps saying, it's all about purity.This is a very funny movie, and I wouldn't want to be an associate producer. (Oh, and be sure to watch through the credits and read them.

Here the con-men are not gangsters or card players, but a group of Hollywood filmmakers who wish to spend several weeks filming in the sleepy town.For a Mamet flick, State is surprisingly cute. Much of the film watches as slick big-city filmmakers try to exploit cuddly small towners, only to find that the country folk aren't as simpleminded as they first seemed. By the film's end everyone is taking advantage of everyone else, money constantly shifting hands and deals hastily being made.Like Altman's The Player, State also satirizes various Hollywood types and Tinseltown customs, poking fun at actors, lawyers, producers, cinematographers, writers, assistants, nudity clauses and amateur theatre productions. Unlike Altman's film, however, Mamet's going for charm and whimsy. It's a light-hearted comedy, though it does contain one dark subplot about clashing egos, the instability of values (see Mamet's Redbelt), artistic integrity and the corrosive power of money. It also gives Mamet a chance to indulge in his love for miscommunication and misdirection - for Mamet, all language is a con - and allows Alec Baldwin to sink his teeth in one of his best roles since Glengarry Glen Ross.Oleanna, also directed by David Mamet, is a claustrophobic film which mostly takes place in a single room. The film's first half consists of a Professor having a long discussion with one of his female students. Later we learn that she is failing his class and that she blames this on his inability to clearly communicate. She then accuses him of using his power as a Professor to engage in a sort of word rape, stating that she dislikes the way that he constantly uses pretentious words and convoluted metaphors to belittle his students. The second half of the film then shows the balance of power shifting between the Professor and the Student. She now speaks with confidence, whilst he continually stammers. She is now dressed with authority, whilst he is dishevelled. As this stage of the film progresses, she accuses him of sexual assault and threatens to have him fired and arrested. He, meanwhile, accuses her of misinterpreting his words and actions.Though overly theatrical (the film was based on one of Mamet's stage plays), Oleanna is endlessly fascinating. Primarily a backlash against the American political correctness movement of the early 1990s, the film takes political correctness to absurd lengths, the point being that if taken to its logical extreme, social sensitivity could become so invasive, so overpowering, that every interpersonal act could be construed as being sexual or punishable in nature.The film also offers a clever critique of educational systems (and their hierarchies of power), and allows Mamet to indulge in his love for word games (syntax as violence). Indeed, the film is one big semantic argument, the characters constantly battling over the meaning of words, Oleanna highlighting both the power and absurdity of language (Mamet has his characters speak in such a fashion as to highlight the very artificiality, arbitrariness and vagueness of words and/or meaning) and the way language leaves us vulnerable to misdirection.In typical Mamet fashion, the film eventually reveals itself to be a giant con game. Here it is explained that the female student was part of a Group which is plotting to remove the Professor from the school's faculty. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

Macy, David Paymer, Alec Baldwin, Sarah Jessica Parker, Julia Stiles, Clark Gregg, and Michael Higgins multiply the laughs. It looks like the cast had fun making this film; I hope they did!

I could watch it a dozen more times. It's not typical Mamet, although I wish it was. The only other Mamet comedies that come to mind are We're No Angels and Wag The Dog and maybe About Last Night. He seems to greatly prefer darker characters and darker themes (Glengarry Glen Ross, American Buffalo, The Verdict, Oleanna, Edmond, etc. etc.) and, most notably, crackling, labyrinthine mysteries (The Spanish Prisoner, Heist, House of Games, Homicide, Spartan).If you listen to the delightful cast commentary on the DVD, you will learn that Mamet is trying his hand at madcap comedy in the style of Preston Sturges (Unfaithfully Yours (1948)). There is never a dull moment. The movie is laced with running gags and brimming with razor-sharp wit. Mamet frequently delights us with complex, busy tracking shots choreographed to a fare-thee-well, moving from character to character and room to room with supporting characters moving in and out. Mamet is in top form as director and writer, which given his prodigious gifts-he won the Pulitzer Prize for Glengarry Glen Ross-means he is working at a level even Woody Allen at the height of his powers would be hard pressed to match.Read the lengthy quotes section if you need proof of this. Every exchange tickles the funnybone. Among the running gags are references to the World Court (Of course he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, The Hague?), the spate of suspicious fires that became the inspiration for the Waterford Huskies (huh?), and the burning question, Does it have to be an Old Mill? The pothole in the center of town is another subtle but brilliant comic leitmotiv. Every time you turn around, somebody's running through the darn thing. Then one night Alec Baldwin hits the pothole-and the consequences send State and Main to a whole new level of hysteria.Some of the best gags are pure through-the-looking-glass nonsense. Joe White tells director Walt Price, I can only write on manual, to which the director replies, I know the feeling. Marty Rossen asks Walt, How are you getting on with these fine people? and Walt answers cheerfully, Like dykes and dogs. Walt tells Claire Wellesey a rambling yarn about Eleanor Duse, trying to inspire Claire to stay with the movie, but when he gets to the moral of the story… And did she do the seven shows? Claire asks. No, Claire, Walt replies, but I think you should do this movie. The cast of State and Main is a dream cast, and everyone delivers winning, spot-on performances. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a standout as the first-time screenwriter sheepishly trying to hang on to his moral compass, and William H. Macy is absolutely superb as the ringmaster who has an attitude to match every situation. But the centerpiece is Rebecca Pidgeon, whose placid warmth and wise charm provide the emotional eye-of-the-storm, the moral center, and the Greek chorus for the movie, anchoring the whirlwind of personal agendas and flawed characters swirling around her. (I will say that I find Mamet's casting of non-actors as bit players more than a bit distracting. He likes to cast his poker buddies, the commentary informs us.) That Pidgeon's Annie dumps her local politician boyfriend and ends up winning the heart of the idealistic Hollywood screenwriter should confound any attempt to simplistically reduce the film to cynical Hollywood venality invades innocent small-town America. The movie is much more ambiguous and complex than that. Despite giving in to their worst impulses and coming within a hair's breadth of disaster for the second time, the film crew finally does get to make their movie. In the end, the moral of the story is, The only second chance in life is the chance to make the same mistake twice.

State and Main like Day for Night is a look on the inside of the very crazy business of putting together a film and there are some real funny gems in this flic. Mamet's characters are always after something, and the reason he is so popular with actors is his ability to write very playable lines. The DVD of State and Main a rare comedy from the writer/director has a wonderful ensemble of actors presenting a wacky and at times cock-eyed version of the film-making world. Anyone who has ever worked on an independent film crew will find a rueful pleasure in the characterizations auteur Mamet gains from his actors. The story is about a film crew on location directed by Walt Price (William H. Macy) in the back woods of Waterford, Vermont having been run out of another town in New Hampshire for murky salacious reasons, but it is hinted that lead actor Bob Barrenger (Alex Baldwin) may have had some sort of personal tryst with a young (very young... below the age of consent) citizen. Walt Price has to find a location to fit the title of the film he's directing, The Old Mill, and this town reportedly has such a landmark. After the film rents out the hotel and sets up shop, they find out that the old mill of the town that is listed in historic literature for the area was burned down in the 1970s as part of some rumored conspiracy, one that actually was responsible for the forming of the Waterford Huskies, the local fire department. The screenwriter Joseph Turner White (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is brought in for rewrites. He is eclectic- only writes with an actual typewriter, and goes to the local resale shop to find one. There he meets Ann Black the owner of the shop and through their love for theatre (she has a copy of White's fist real stage play), they form an attraction for each other and begin to fall in love. Love in this world is a brittle thing, but not beyond the grasp of two kindred souls like Ann and Joseph, and amidst all the shenanigans, their relationship is something that weathers the test of any and all conflicts. This screwball comedy escalates to a fast and furious pace as Barrenger hooks up with youngster waitress Carla (Julia Stiles), and is ultimately arrested for child abuse by Ann's fiancée and local politician Doug McKenzie (Clark Gregg) seeking a trophy for his climb up the local political mountain. Added to this lead actress Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) refuses a nude scene that she agreed to do to make the film, and producer Mary Rossen (David Paymer) has to finagle some way to appease her and get his lead actor Barrenger out of jail, while also attempting to attach post-modern product placement into a period film dated in the 1800s. It all comes to a head, but happily for the pure of heart Ann Black and Joseph Turner White, and ultimately the film goes into production with the entire town turning our for extra work and emotional support for the crew and those involved. It's all tongue-in-cheek with many a laughable moments generated from the performances, the dialogue, and this ideas that Mamet generates about the film industry and an alternate culture to be reviled as well as honored for many of the same reasons. A few of the really good lines (there are many more punctuated by sight gags!) - Walt Price It's not a lie. It's a gift for fiction. - Joseph Turner White What's an associate producer credit? Bill Smith It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise. - Bob Barrenger I know my lines. &#133; I just don't know what order they come in. - And a great line that gets tossed around by just about every character as an exclamation point to something they've just said &#150; Go you Huskies! I would recommend that any film student see this as class assignment in their first year of film school, because it brings up many of the actual issues that a film company faces when making a movie, and pokes fun at them at the same time. Mamet has the unique ability to craft very quotable lines and this film has plenty of them and very well placed, interacting with visual cues. One of the best scenes is with William Macy and Sarah Jessica Parker in the director and actrees moment in the Eleonora Duse scene in the cramped bathroom.

For reasons not disclosed, they've been run out of one small town and now are in another one in Vermont. With him are his writer, Joseph Turner White,(Hoffman), heretofore a playwright, his stars (Baldwin & Parker), and various other assistants, cameramen, etc.The name of the film is The Old Mill and the exciting thing about this town is that it actually has one. Well, it had one - they find out it burned down. This is actually the least of their problems. The female star refuses to bare her breasts, though someone comments that most of America can draw them from memory; then she holds them up for $800,000. The male lead likes underage girls and gets in a car accident with one in the car. Unfortunately, the writer is a witness, and due to the influence of a townswoman, Ann, he has fallen for (Pidgeon) he wants to maintain his integrity.The Mayor (Durning) is willing to turn over the whole town to them seemingly for free until someone finds out it would cost $6 million to build a set of the town, so all the playing up to the Mayor seems to be for nothing. And an attorney, ex-fiancé of Ann's, is ready to extract revenge on the company by legal means. Meanwhile, the wife of someone on the crew is having a baby, White can't type because he caught his finger in a fish hook, and the Price keeps asking for the scene where the horse dies. When White says, You know you can't kill a horse, the director's angry answer is f--- me. I'm sure some of this is very true to life, especially the director being hounded from all sides constantly and having to put out a million fires. Also the cover-up of the accident I'm sure has happened. The movie captures the awe that townspeople have when Hollywood types come in to make a film, as well as the self-indulgence of the actors.Most of the time, the film was pretty funny. It's not Mamet's best by any means. It's a light story with some very good performances, particularly by Macy, who plays a determined director who pretends to be nice to perfection, and Hoffman, who walks around in a dream world on his first film. Baldwin nonchalantly gives us the narcissistic essence of his character, and Parker is a riot acting as if she's being asked to commit murder instead of something she's done a million times.The end shouldn't come as any surprise. I would say this is atypical Mamet that, had it not been for the stars, could have been a TV movie.

Most film scripts rely on special effects and actors to make them memorable. It's rare that you'll find a movie where the star is the dialogue, and not a thespian or CGI explosion. But with David Mamet, that's what you get.In general, I'm not a David Mamet fan. Although his films are always well-written, and his trademark stylization of speaking dialogue in his movies is always fun to listen to (although it's restrained here), they are not my cup of tea. I didn't like Glengarry Glen Ross, and I found Spartan interesting but poorly paced. I did, however, like his hysterical play, November, and after hearing good things about State and Main from critics and word of mouth, I decided to check it out. It's consistently amusing, but not as funny as it wants to be.State and Main is an ensemble comedy. It's about a desperate film crew who finally finds a place to shoot their movie, but they are all about to have a disastrous run-in with Murphy's Law. The big-star, Bob Beringer (Alec Baldwin) can't keep himself from his hobby (young girls like Carla, played by Julia Stiles). The director, Walt Price (Mamet regular William H. Macy) suddenly realizes that his newfound shooting spot doesn't have an old mill anymore (the film they're shooting is called The Old Mill). The ditsy female star, Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) is having second thoughts about taking her shirt off on camera. And the screenwriter, Joeseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is having to constantly rewrite his script to deal with the crises, all while falling for his newfound muse, the local bookstore owner Ana (Rebecca Pigeon, aka Mrs. David Mamet).The best thing about this movie (other than the brilliant script) is the fact that Mamet never takes the easy way out. He eschews the easy targets (movie stars with huge egos and/or no brains, greedy lawyers, etc.). To be sure, they make an appearance, but they aren't a huge source of the film's comedy. This is all but to be expected; Mamet has been on the film scene for the last two decades, and is widely recognized as one of the best script doctors. He knows how making a movie REALLY works, and attacks it with a his scythe of satire.Unfortunately, while this opens up the potential for new and funny jokes, plot twists and gags (and Mamet actually exploits it), it's just not as funny as he intended it to be. It's clear that this is supposed to be 105 minutes of madcap insanity, which it is, but it's just not a laugh a minute riot (as was the intention).The acting is great, and the actors poke fun at their reputations (like Baldwin and Parker). And we actually begin to care about Joesph and Ana. And although it's not as funny as it is meant to be, there are some great one liners.It's worth a rental, especially for Mamet fans, movie lovers, and intelligent viewers.

Mamet is credited as the writer and director. The most compelling character in the film, Ann, who owns and runs the town's book store and heads the town drama club, is played excellently by Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon. Her brother, Matthew Pidgeon, has a bit part as a British TV newscaster, Mamet's brother Tony plays an electrician. While on the subject of the cast, Broadway musical great Patti LuPone does a nice job, in a very minor role, as the small town Mayor's wife who apparently has high society ambitions and apparently money enough to back up that ambition. She is not someone you want to make angry because the Mayor (Charles Durning effortlessly playing a kind of mild- mannered role I've seen him in before) is also the Town Council. As long as his wife is happy he is thrilled to have the company use his town. Major movie star and heartthrob Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), the male lead of the movie that the fictional film company is making, is an oblivious sex addict with a taste for underage girls. His activities are one of the major problems the film director (William H. Macy) and producers face. Another is that the lead actress (Sarah Jessica Parker), who was cast because of her contractual agreement to play a nude scene as she has done in several earlier films, has changed her mind. A third crisis for the producers has to do with the town's historic mill that was the main reason they chose the town, and a fourth is a splendid stained glass window that is in the way of a crucial camera shot.I would have preferred that the film had a different title than  State and Main. Perhaps something such as The Old Mill Set or Second Chance. I think I noticed two goofs in the film When a date on the white board has to be written again because it is accidentally erased, it is clearly rewritten on the same date as the original. In a critical later scene it is at a different date. The other is Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the fictional first time screenwriter and author of the fictional book the fictional film is based on, says at one point that he has perjured himself although he knows at that time that he was not really under oath when he lied. When watching State and Main, don't turn it off before the credits or you'll miss some of the wit.

Problem is, the building they want to use burned downed in 1960.Comments A movie about all the small things that complicate your life as a movie producer or director. Never mind that you're short on cash and time, but when your lead star has an improper taste for (too) young girls, your shooting location burnt down a few decades ago and a town council member really hates you, then you almost appreciate the small troubles of life.This intention to make the movie a hectic, intense and funny project that finds trouble everywhere it goes is also it biggest problem. There are so many small sub-plots that none of them are given much time to grow and evolve. The result is that there are a lot of small ha-has but you never got a joke that really is given time to build up and make you roll on the floor laughing.It is nice, not hilarious. But it does redeem itself a little at the end, where it actually connects a lot of these sub-plots in one scene. And it also got a good cast with a few actually making a little something with the scarce screen time they get with so many plots to go around.

I always tell the story about the time I went with some friends to the cinema and convinced everyone to watch this film and once inside the theater everyone wanted to go because they didn't like what they were watching but I wanted to stay because I liked it very much. And because I think there's a time for movies and that they arrive when they arrive, I have just found David Mamet's State and Main and, luckily, I've liked it very much. Of course, it's a special movie, but not in the sense that it's not for everyone. It's an easy-going movie, with a clear and simple plot line, nice sceneries and a cinematography that doesn't take any risks; but I could merely recommend, with enthusiasm, that everyone who watches assume a commitment. What do I mean by this? Well, that if you pay more attention than usual you should really enjoy it. The thing is that State and Main is a movie about a movie, and it's written by David Mamet, fact that naturally makes it not 'any' movie about a movie. I'll take a risk and say that this is based on one of Mamet's plays (I don't know that for a fact), because it looks very theatrical, but with the exceptional cast (by genius Avy Kaufman) and Theodore Shapiro's shifting score, we quickly forget about it. We don't forget, however, what may originally have come from a play; and that's Mamet's use of language. From scene one, where a doctor encounters a patient on the street and Walt (William H. Macy) argues with his team about the place they've ended up in, the writer/director establishes a style in his screenplay that we feel throughout the whole ride and contains certain characteristics sharp, witty, direct, humorous and, at surprising times, reflexive and profound. Walt is a director who comes to shoot a film to Waterford, Vermont; the place they've ended up in the middle of nowhere. The fact that Waterford is a little town where everyone has a big smile on their faces and don't seem to have problems (Julia Stiles' perfect working teenager; Rebecca Pidgeon's kind and loving Annie; Charles Durning's mayor), helps to establish a contrast with the neurotic director and his Hollywood crew the manipulative and unstoppable producer Marty (a wonderful David Paymer); the popular star with a 'thing' for minors Bob (the role Alec Baldwin knows by heart); the pretty and stupid popular actress (Sarah Jessica Parker, in the role that suits her quite well); and the character with which you should implement my recommendation of paying attention the creative, insecure writer of the film, Joe, played by the Great Philip Seymour Hoffman. Stereotypes? Why not some of them? But Manet is so gifted that, instead of assuming a character is stereotyped, he gives them lines for us to recognize, through their personality, the stereotype they represent. This sound simple, but it's not. It's the same I try to say about State and Main it looks simple, and it can be; but it doesn't have to be if you want it to. If you want, you can put yourselves in Joe the writer's position and try to figure out the truth, whatever it may be. If you want, you can enter as an outsider to the world of making a film and what it has to offer; to the political aspirations and perspectives of a little town; to the tradition and the stories and the sense of home of a little town. Mamet knows all of these things, and here sometimes he takes a stand; he sometimes mocks, other times he praises, most of the time he makes no sense at all, but all the time he's showing these things to us, in any form you may want to take them.

Mamet takes us to a small town in Vermont where Bill Macy is trying to set up locations for a film he is directing, (Some problems there with the old watermill, the centerpiece of the story, which doesn't exist anymore.)Alec Baldwin is a little careless about his attraction to young girls and this adds to the difficulties when he's put upon by the authorities. He has the best line though -- the last in the film -- when he shuffles off to the set and mutters, It beats working. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a strange face, indeed a strange presence, and brings a good deal of talent to the role of a screenwriter with principle, probably the closest thing to a protagonist the movie offers us. He quits his job at one point before having an epiphany and returning to work. And he has a romance with the attractive, perceptive, flatly matter-of-fact Rebecca Pigeon, who projects an extraordinary intelligence and sexiness despite her ski boots and overgrown running shoes, which any normal viewer would love to pluck off and turn into soup. As their romance is nudged forward by events, she asks Hoffman, How do you feel about children? He stares back open mouthed, his mind whirling, before he replies, I never could see the point. I just claimed his mind was whirling but he gives no evidence of it in his behavior. He simply stands there agog and hesitates for some seconds before speaking. But a viewer KNOWS his brain is clicking, even though it's moving in an unanticipated direction. That's acting talent, and pretty good writing too. Some clever lines are sprinkled over the script. Macy examines the wardrobe sketches and remarks, Who designed these costumes? It looks like Edith Head puked and the puke designed the costumes.

I predict that when that happens, you'll never pry me out of my recliner chair in front of the TV. I also like the Special Features that you typically get with DVD's nowadays. With State and Main, there is a lengthy commentary track where several of the actors make interesting running commentary about the film, while pertinent segments of the film itself are replayed in the background. Long, but worth watching.Going by the generally good reviews of this film, plus my aforementioned admiration of Mamet's work, I took a chance and decided to buy this DVD instead of renting it.

What advances this film from the rest of the float-muck that came out at 2000 was probably theobvious ability of Mamet to corporate with his casts and thus produced the best ensemble performance since Magnolia (1999) or so i think. Even if you're a pop corn junkie who have less understanding about complications of making a movie, this wouldnt thump your cerebrums, hell , my 14 yr old Sister laugh at the usual Mamet- dialogue -oriented Jokes and she got Clueless (1995) as one of her favourite movie.

I conclude my praise for the acting with the performance of character actor David Paymer as the roughnecked take-no-bullsh*t Producer, stealing every scene he is in, with his razor mouther utterings, he got the best lines in this flick, all in all this almost preceeds the Movie producer role of Dustin Hoffman as Stanley Motts in Wag the Dog (1997) i said almost!

The dialogue is pure Mamet crisp, delivered in stacatto fashion, and very quirky.The casting is inspired. William H. Macy and David Paymer were born to play their roles. Rebecca Pidgeon gives an inspired performance. Between her and William H. Macy, I don't know who has the better lines. Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker play their roles to the hilt.This is an A+++ film. I've seen it more than five times and haven't grown tired of it yet. Every time I watch it, I see something I missed earlier.SPOILER ALERT!!!To really enjoy this film you have to pay close attention. I'm not kidding here, many of the lines and scenes have subtle sight gags, foreshadowing, and symbolism. Some examples are given belowThere are Easter Eggs in the closing credits. Pay attention to them, they are quite amusing.In one scene where Julia Stiles' character (jailbait) is exposed for having a tryst with Alec Baldwin's character, her father can't believe his daughter lied to him by saying she was at a friends studying phonics.In another scene, they are filling up the sets bottle water by filling an Evian water bottle with tap water, screwing on the tap, then running a light around the cap an broken safety seal to make it appear that the bottles are original.and finally There is a line that goes Once again the past comes to our rescue. This is uttered when the power goes out in a storm and one character resorts to an old fashioned oil lamp for light. This is foreshadowing to a scene leading up to the climax of the film where something from the town's history is used to help one of the characters.

This changes dramatically the original shot scheduling and obliges everyone to spend much more time in town and to modify the story accordingly. Modifying the story time passes and people town lives are modified as well by the giant-state represented by Hollywood and its array. A film in a film, starting from Francois Truffaut up to know, this is a very brilliant film with characters exchanging their life and giving a breathe and a reason to live to the nothing happens town Vermont. Different stories link to each other in a perfect and funny puzzle, as some Robert Altman's films. At the end the lesson is quite simple but realistic is something has to happen will certainly happens, film will be shot and all obstacles will be overcome and at the end there is a real happy ending.Rating 7/10    "}{"Title":"A funny, razor-sharp movie about movies.","Date":"31 March 2002","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  I found this to be one of the funniest, most satisfying recent comedies I've seen in years.  Without sacrificing his own trademark style, Mamet nicely tips the hat to Preston Sturges and Howard Hawks, and his updates of their whipcrack pace and unsentimental good humor keep the movie humming from beginning to end.Praise to the whole cast, top to bottom.  It's rare to see a group of actors having this much obvious fun in a movie.  Baldwin and Parker get the Good Sportsmanship awards for their hilarious self-parodies.  As the lead actors in The Old Mill/The Fires of Home they capture the essence of what we've always secretly suspected movie stars to be like--flakes, in short.  Hoffman and Pidgeon make an unexpectedly charming couple.  While we may justifiably suspect Mamet's motives in making the screenwriter the hero, any suspicions are dispelled by Hoffman's sweet, burbling inarticulateness.  He's a likeable schmuck, with almost too much integrity to live.  (I love the jacket photograph for his play Anguish-- his expression dutifully constipated.)  And Pidgeon has a quality of continuous unexpectedness-- anything she says is both a surprise and somehow completely believable.Best of all, perhaps are Macy and Paymer-- terribly funny and wonderfully nasty.  Macy, as the director, plays good cop, shoveling tons of sweetened b.s. to work his will with the actors-- there's a terrific moment when his long, careful cajoling of an actor is suddenly undone by his assistant's stupid comment Macy's glare speaks volumes of contempt and baffled loathing, like a preying vampire suddenly defeated by a cross.  And Paymer, having a ball and dressed to the nines in black, gets to bathe in mean.  He gives the verbal equivalent of a pistol-whipping to a small-town power player and then, as the victim cowers shocked and speechless, offers him a cigar it's a perfect display of control and disarmament, conversational judo.All in all, smart, good comedy.

He's not known for his soft side. In his movies, the f word is used as all of the eight main parts of speech. Don't get me wrong, though, his scripts are among the best in the business (although sometimes you get the feeling that a movie he's written was intended for the stage, as the actors seem talky to a fault).In State and Main, a band of moviemakers descends upon a quiet town in Vermont to film a movie called The Old Mill. (The group was kicked out of a similar New Hampshire town during filming; they had to build an old mill, but when they were kicked out, the town held the mill for ransom.) Waterford, VT is the perfect little town, and the company quickly begins to work. Director Walt Price (William H. Macy) buddies up with the mayor, a corpulent man, who is understandably happy to have his town in a movie. Chaos invades the town, which alternately meets the challenge with bemusement and an eye for opportunity.Price has a lot of problems on the set. His leading lady (Sarah Jessica Parker) has recently discovered religion and refuses to bare her breasts, as stipulated in her contract. His leading man (Alec Baldwin) has a bad habit of hooking up with underage girls (Hey, everyone's gotta have a hobby, he's fond of saying). His timid but honest screenwriter (Philip Seymour Hoffman) can't write, since the company's lost his trusty old typewriter. And to top it all off, the town has no old mill. None. It had one, yes, but it burned down in the 1960s during a spate of mysterious fires. So to fix the problem, Price demands that Joe the screenwriter rewrite the movie to reflect the lack of a mill, which of course means changing the title. Mamet does a wonderful job lampooning his own industry, and from some of the performances you get the idea that these folks aren't acting as much as being themselves. Baldwin, for example, has long had the reputation of being a bit self-centered on the set, and the machinations of Price and his producer, Marty (David Paymer), are fun to watch. This is a lively film. There's plenty going on, although a lot does center on the problems and issues of Joe (who's hardly ever called that in the movie; he's usually just referred to as the screenwriter), who falls for the pretty and talented Ann (Rebecca Pidgeon), the organizer and main impetus for the town's stage troupe. Hoffman's portrayal is sincere and believeable, and his interaction with Pidgeon is a real treat. Mamet's known for using the same actors in his movies, and Pidgeon and Macy are both regulars of his stock company. Some of the best directors employ this tactic, as it build loyalty among a group of actors. If you're comfortable working with someone, then you might want to keep working with them, and if the smoothness of this movie is any indication, Mamet worked pretty well with his excellent cast.

On the way to tell the story, Mamet give us his sarcastic view about how films are made in Hollywood. How everything revolve around money and how money can basically buy everything.When you watch the movie you have the feeling that Mamet is speaking from a first hand experience and that some of the character are based on real life one. How ever all the same I was left with the feeling that Mamet wanted to eat the cake and leave it at one piece. He wanted to make a satire but he couldn't make a very sharp one because he had to think of his future in Hollywood. So he opted for a light satire, funny and sarcastic enough to be enjoyed by a lot of people but not strong enough to offend anyone in the business.

Rather than ridicule them, with his latest film (the first comedy he's directed since 1988's Things Change), Mamet skims its charm off the top and lets the audience have a taste.Philip Seymour Hoffman is Joe White, a playwright-turned-screenwriter who's been recruited along with his script to work on a film for the first time. Joe is not unlike the title character of the Coen's Barton Fink. He's a fish out of water, in a place that goes against everything he believes in. At the same time, the film world is something he needs desperately. Joe falls head over heels for the town and one of its most known and loved faces, bookstore owner Ann Black (Rebecca Pidgeon). It's like he's living in two worlds simultaneously, one pure and simple, the other corrupt and shameless. The town's residents are taken by the Hollywood glitz and glamour, but aren't corrupted by it as the film's marketing would suggest. They understand the temporal nature of the situation and want to make the most of it while it's there. Unfortunately for Ann, they'd rather walk through a shot in the film as extras than follow through with the speaking parts they have in the play she's putting on.The moral dilemma that Joe finds himself in fuels the rest of the story. It's interesting to see how little truth and integrity matter when money and deadlines are involved (which is in no way exclusive to the film industry).

The movie is directed by David Mamet, whose production won the Jury Award for best film and best supporting actor at the Ft. Lauderdale International Film Festival this year; maybe that is because when we are not laughing at the quaint and lovable humor in State and Main, we are smiling at it.The film begins like a character study, and in some ways is, but as the movie progresses, we realize it is not the characters who overrun the story, but it is the characters and the screenplay working together that create a very effective storyline; the characters follow the inventive flow of the plot smoothly. They are not kept within strict boundaries, but have leeway to explore relationships and feelings. Because of the careful measures Mamet takes, we come to care enormously about these characters and thus the story is greatly involving. State and Main takes stereotyping to a whole new level; each and every character in this film is over-the-top in their expected vision. The story details a film crew's misadventures when they travel to a sleepy location (Waterford, Vermont) as they prepare to film The Old Mill, only to learn the great impact their presence makes on the ordinary residents. There is the stereotypical director, Walt Price (William H. Macy), who is bound and determined to construct the movie, even without an old mill. He spends most of his stressful time on a cell phone or ordering his crew around. Then there is the producer, Marty (David Paymer), who is, as expected, sly, stylish, and cunning as he is plotted against by a greedy lawyer, MacKenzie (Clark Gregg). There is a whimsical romance between the movie's temperate, near/far sighted screenwriter, Joseph Turner White (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and a gentle bookstore owner, Ann (Rebecca Pidgeon). Then there is the film's actors, the handsome and arrogant superstar Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin), who is sexually overwhelmed, a tempting but teenage staff at the crew's hotel (Julia Stiles). The leading lady, a blonde bimbo and sex symbol named Claire Wellesley (appropriately portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker), who refuses to expose herself on camera at the last minute, even though she is contract obligateds her to do so.A lot of the film consists of dialogue and eccentrics of the characters, and is often left going in many different directions at once, which occasionally becomes a nuisance. However, the dialogue is so cute and smart, we do not need a lot of action or slapstick to enjoy this little piece of comedy heaven. Mamet creates thought-provoking subplots within his broad original story, giving us variety and generous opportunities to become involved; if we do not like one of the characters and his or her quintessence, then there is plenty of others to make up for that.The performances and casting are what really allow the picture to take off. The irony that makes the film so witty and funny, as I have said, comes from how the actors stereotype their characters to the point of almost spoof. William H. Macy, winner of the Jury Prize mentioned, is well cast and effectively takes the role of an exploiting, fast-talking director; his performance is unique and ecstatic. After starring in unusual roles in movies like Chill Factor and Carpool, it is fun to see David Paymer as an aggressive, cynical, distinguished producer in this production, as he plays his character straight and humorously. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always a pleasure to watch, and although his best performance is still in The Talented Mr. Ripley, he fits his character well here, with delicate persona and perfect charm. Alec Baldwin holds nothing back from his esteemed, self-centered character, and Sarah Jessica Parker reprises her Dudly Do-Right role.State and Main is the type of movie where you leave the theater smiling and happy. It is not profound or explicit, but sticks with you for a while because we so rarely find a movie with this much joy and satisfaction. This is one of the better movies released this year.

(He also half-ruined Homicide with an illogical ending.) Instead of continuing the movie with the sort of fun satiric tone established by that point, he tries to moralize in a most pathetic old-school-Hollywood way.Hoffman is having second thoughts about how he will testify, just because he cares so much about the truth and because a sudden rush of patriotism devours him! Even worse Hoffman is supposed to be a likable character, but in fact he loses all MY sympathy when he decides to betray the entire film crew for some very skewed moral Americana reasons. Mamet has his morality all wrong, to say the least he expects the viewer to identify with Hoffman's childish impulse to be honest and tell the truth even if doing so would only serve to ruin a whole bunch of people who are simply trying to get a film made, while at the same time promoting the career of a jealous, unsympathetic, ambitious politician! Of course, doing so would also ruin his own career, making him some kind of super-principled, likable martyr. Yeah, right... Pidgeon, who once again plays in a Mamet movie because no one else besides her husband would hire her (for obvious lack of talent), even encourages her boyfriend Hoffman to tell the truth; this makes HER unsympathetic, as well. So what have we got? The movie's love-couple is made up of two unlikable characters and the viewer is supposed to feel good about their happiness. Mamet also employs too many plot-devices that rely on coincidences, so much so that they eventually get annoying.The first hour is fun. The characters of the director, the producer, the main male star, and the main female star, are all well thought-out and amusing. Baldwin plays the typical male moron star who thinks with his penis, and it is a very amusing, clever premise that he has a weakness for under-aged girls. (Though, as I find out later, Mamet used it only because he wanted to create that legal nonsense in the last part of the movie.) Parker plays the typical, over-sensitive, spoiled bimbo actress who causes a ruckus about showing her breasts in a scene. In fact, the best scene in the movie is when the producer (a very likable character) roasts Parker about her contractual obligations. Then again, maybe Mamet - in his infinite lack of moral vision - expects us to dislike the producer and the director, who are, ironically, presented more sympathetically than probably 95% of all real-life producers and directors.This is no Living In Oblivion. Well, apart from the fact that Mamet seems to live in a moral oblivion. Instead of finishing the movie the way he started it, Mamet opts for trite plot-twists that offer little comedy and make little sense. The casting is also a problem to an extent. Hoffman is far too unsympathetic and uncharismatic to play a likable lead character - especially when the character ironically isn't even likable thanks to Mamet's idiotic sense of what is morally right - and his love-interest is played by a Pidgeon who, though having improved on her acting somewhat, hasn't got much charisma. (She was far worse in The Spanish Prisoner.) Parker, though a solid actress, is simply too unattractive to play a Hollywood star. (Then again, considering how many female 90s stars are ugly (Diaz, Barrymore, Roberts) maybe she isn't that ugly, after all.) The rest of the casting is good. In the end-titles the voice behind Dr.Katz can be heard (David Mamet was a guest on the show in an episode).

As a matter of fact although this story is told in a very simple way without any kind of sensational images, it has to do with such complicated things like corruption, love, honesty, sex, integrity and conscience, money and last but not least all the difficulties and problems that arise when you are making a movie. A film crew arrives at a small provincial town in Vermont, U.S.A, to make a movie there and all the troubles begin because of the clash of mentalities between locals and members of the crew and the seduction induced on the former by the latter's presence. The character of the screen-play writer is fundamental here with his belief in the second chance that must always be given to any man to correct a mistake or a wrongdoing and his anguish and hesitations in choosing the right moral way himself as a witness in court. A second chance will be indeed be given to him though it will show itself unnecessary after all which by its awkwardness represents maybe the weakest point of the movie. Purity is the main theme of the movie that is being made in that small town. But in the real world outside will it win in the end? To find the answer you must go and see this movie.

But Mamet shows how much can be wrung out of this scenario without going for the obvious.  His craft is as good as ever.He knows that, should a conflict develop between town and Hollywood, our sympathies will be with Hollywood.  The production crew come to the town with a quest they have a film to complete.  All else being equal we will want them to succeed.  If the film were to turn out to be about the townsfolk's efforts to preserve their way of life, or to repel the invaders, or some such, we would be disappointed - but it doesn't, and we aren't.Mamet does make an inexplicable slip at the end.  We see a short segment of the film that's being made, and it's absurdly cheap and corny - unworthy of at least three of our protagonists the director, the writer, and the woman who becomes the writer's inspiration (three excellent performances, by the way).  Why couldn't Mamet have revealed to us that all this effort was going into a GOOD movie?  The reasons in favour of doing so are overwhelming we'd get to watch a couple of minutes of something good rather than a couple of minutes of something bad, we wouldn't feel let down by the protagonists, and the product placement joke would be all the funnier.  And we know, from the rest of the film if from nowhere else, that Mamet is capable of constructing pleasing, tight, self-contained film scenes.It was a nice touch to include unanswered questions about the town's past.  We don't get the answers because the protagonists don't; they don't because they are, after all, just passing through.

I was hooked within five minutes into the movie by Macy's character.  The conversations via phone with the Producer enabled a hook into what will happen next.  The Old Mill being burned down was perfect in introducing us to the screenwriter, who had to re-write the script.  It brought us completely into Hoffman, who as I felt, was THE leading man in the movie.  He may not be the typical hunk of today, but Hoffman evokes a man that is sensitive, caring, and the type of man I was taught to revere as a child.  This was his character, as he was dealt with the purity of his script - which Rebecca Pidgeon helped him understand.  Hoffman and Macy were the movie - with help from Pidgeon and David Paymer (another one of my favorites).  Naturally, everyone played into it and they did a fine job - but for my money, I was lost in the aforementioned characters and their plight. This is a must see for Hoffman fans - I predict Hoffman will be elevated to new heights sooner with his fine acting talents.  He is flexible, funny and flawless in his performances herewith.

Mamet allows his actors to bring a real humanity to their roles yet this isn't always a good thing; Clark Gregg, as a local politician with statewide aspirations, brings a complex and earnest shading to his role that Mamet manages to undermine and humiliate. The director is clearly looking to combine Frank Capra's love of the common man with Billy Wilder's deeply-ingrained cynicism and the ensemble interaction of Paul Thomas Anderson (many of the players are Anderson veterans) and he doesn't embarrass himself in doing this; but it's a very shallow piece of filmmaking and his pandering to the art-house crowd tells you more about Mamet than you want to know.

You saw it in Bye Bye Birdie when the Ed Sullivan Show came to Sweet Apple Ohio, and again in Sweet Liberty, that awful film starring Alan Alda which, like this film, is about a movie production and its stars taking over a New England town. Like Alda's dismal film, the plot here also revolves around the screenwriter. Fortunately, unlike that movie, nothing here is predictable or trite.The plot careens helter skelter, building tension around small plot details that are introduced, but not immediately resolved, such as what will happen when the dinner with the mayor is missed because an aid enters the appointment for the wrong day? How will Alec Baldwin's character's penchant for young girls get him into trouble? The plot builds nicely to its climax, pays off smoothly, and then finishes. Everything works, but as with another recent film with a quirky, unpredictable plot -- Wonder Boys -- I kept hoping for the script to take a few extra steps to make this a great movie, rather than just a very good one.In particular, as the movie progresses, we see the character at the center of the movie -- the screenwriter -- struggle with his conscience, his craft, and his relationship with a local woman. He wants desperately to succeed, but his nature is slow and thoughtful, and not well-suited to the demands of the instant re-write. He is slow on the uptake. He is continually challenged, in almost every scene, to find the essence of his story -- its purity -- and he eventually does exactly that. However, the climax here could have been far greater if only the screenwriter of this movie could have somehow inhabited the soul of his alter ego for a few moments. The fictional screenwriter, Joseph Turner White, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, is put in the middle of situations that seem to be writing the material for him. All he has to do is observe and understand the situations around him, and incorporate their essence into his work. The failure of David Mamet (who wrote this screenplay) to let his main character learn from and use all the wonderful quirky situations he observers, relegates all of the nifty little setpieces in this film to nothing more than clever distractions which help carry the plot to the next step, but never fulfill its ultimate promise.Attempting greatness and failing can doom a film.

However, it seems that Mamet has her imprisoned in an acting birdcage by asking her to play the same stereotypical character in movie after movie. Pidgeon, a fine actress, should escape from the Mamet prison and work with other directors. Now, I do have to say that Mamet's screenplay was mainly sharp and practical. However, the story was the attribute that left me in a state of dissatisfaction. I would recommend `State & Main' for its righteous acting and crafty screenplay.

Like last years equally entertaining 'Bowfinger', 'State and Main' is an examination of how disconnected Hollywood is from the 'real world'. Yet, where as 'Bowfinger' was a manic parody, Mamet's love for his subject leads to this being more of a homage to these practices, a celebration of such lunacy. The setting is suitably pleasant (think 'It's a Wonderful Life and you'll be fairly close), the scripting subtle in its quirky humour, and the performances masterful. Baldwin and Parker in particular, thrive on sending up their real-life counterparts as the lead actor who has a penchant for teenage women (Rob Lowe, anyone?) and the actress who, since finding God, refuses to do a nude scene. Yet the best performance comes from Macy as hyperactive director 'Walt Price', who supplies a constant stream of quality one-liners throughout.Granted, the film isn't the greatest comedy ever (inspiring more knowing chuckles then belly laughs) and, if you're a 'shock-a-second thrill seeker', it may not be your kind of thing. But if you prefer something a little more cerebral, infinitely more subtle, and genuinely heart-warming then you could do far worse.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"My comments deal with how impressed I was with how well this film was crafted but how disappointed I am that it has no universal appeal or general interest as a film for the public.","Date":"24 June 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  David Mamet and his outstanding cast have created an accurate but humiliating portrait of everything that is negative about the film business without creating anything past this one joke film.

"},{"Title":"If it wasn't for the director...","Date":"13 March 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  Dirty Harry Callahan once said a man has to know his limitations.  David Mamet should have taken this to heart.  A witty and perceptive writer, Mamet has translated his cynical worldview into some truly fine screenplays, including Glengarry Glen Ross, Hoffa, and Wag The  Dog.  It's when he directs his own work, however, that the material loses its spark.  His book, On Directing Film, lays out his functional, bare-bones stylistic sensibility, and while I applaud him for having such a clearly defined conception of the medium, it's a vision that leaches the life from his films.  State and Main is a great example of this, a humorous, clever screenplay which, under Mamet's leaden direction, turns into a curiously mundane and uninvolving experience.State and Main is set in a town under siege.  The town  Waterford, Vermont, a picturesque Norman Rockwell New England hamlet.  The invaders  the cast and crew of The Old Mill, a big-budget Hollywood picture that was chased out of the last town it shot in because of the statutory sexual tastes of its lead actor (Alec Baldwin).  The film crew slowly insinuates its way into the fabric of small-town life, and soon, even the townies at the local coffee shop are reading Variety and discussing box-office share.  Meanwhile, the old mill the crew came to shoot has been torn down, and because the film's lead actress (Sarah Jessica Parker) has suddenly refused to bare her breasts for the camera (even though she's done it in practically every other film she's done), the only way the film can be bailed out of budgetary hell is by finding a way to work in a plug for a dotcom company.  No mean feat for a turn-of-the-century costume drama.The pivotal figure at the core of the drama is The Old Mill's screenwriter (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a once-promising playwright desperate to keep his integrity in the Hollywood rat race.  As he suffers the slings and arrows typical of the screenwriter's life, he finds himself falling in love with a local (Rebecca Pidgeon) and embroiled in an ethical crisis when he discovers Baldwin's star in a compromising position with yet another teenage girl (Julia Stiles).  When the scandal hits the local news, will the writer keep his integrity or cover his ass?  It sounds like promising material for a film, and indeed Mamet's screenplay puts it across with a fair degree of panache.  There's a number of amusing running gags, including a perplexing problem with a firehouse window and the writer's frustrating inability to resolve the issue of the actress' chest.  While the screenplay has quite a few loose ends and insufficiently developed plot threads (hints of Mamet's origins as a playwright), the main thrust is engaging, and the characters intriguing enough to keep you watching.  And of course, there's a fair helping of Mamet's curiously circular dialogue and intricately constructed gag lines.Unfortunately, this praise only applies to the screenplay, not the film that results from it.  After setting the scene for a quite exciting little satire, Mamet the screenwriter turns things over to Mamet the director, who proceeds to sap the spark and trickiness out of the material.  The film is well-acted, with Hoffman and Pidgeon providing a strong ethical and narrative anchor, and fine work being contributed by William H. Macy and David Paymer as, respectively, the film's director and the actress' agent.  Still, we get the feeling throughout the picture that any fire and passion we're seeing is being contributed by the actors.  Indeed, Mamet's presence as a director is barely felt throughout State and Main.  The style of the film is completely bland; cinematography is of the plunk-it-down-and-let-it-run school, music is unmemorable, and the picturesque design of the little town is never truly exploited for its homespun beauty.  The actors deliver their dialogue while standing around in stagy geometric patterns, Mamet ignoring the time tested law, cinema is action.  The drama eventually grows static as a result of this directorial indifference, and by the time the first hour has passed, you'll find yourself checking your watch.  Eventually, you don't really care how it turns out.  You just hope it turns out so you can go home.The mind boggles when considering what a truly gifted comic director could have done with State and Main.  With a reasonably good script and a fine cast like this, a Woody Allen or a Barry Levinson could have turned this into an edgy, exhilarating little gem.  Unfortunately, State and Main is a David Mamet film, and as such, what you see is all you get, no more, no less.  And believe me, after spending an hour and forty-five minutes in the all-too-sleepy town of Waterford, you'll find yourself wishing it was a lot less.

She truly gives an Oscar Worthy performance as Ann Black, the fiesty and spunky bookstore owner who acts as muse and romantic interest for struggling screen writer Joseph Turner White, played extremely well by Philip Seymour Hoffman. The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching their relationship blossom. They had great chemistry together.  The movie is essentially about a Hollywood movie crew that invades a Vermont town to film a movie called the Old Mill. Problems arise when they discover the Old Mill has burned down so the script has to change which creates the problem for Hoffman's character. Enter Rebecca Pidgeon to light the fire of imagination for Hoffman to help him regain his confidence. Meanwhile the lead actor, Bob Barrenger, has a thing for underaged girl Carla Taylor played by Julia Stiles, so he becomes involved with her while her father Jack Taylor. thinks she is out studying, Jack Taylor is played by Ricky Jay. The Baldwin character ends up in a traffic accident witht the young girl which destroys the Main Street traffic light. Comedy relief is provided in the form of William H. Macy as Walt, the self obsessed director and David Paymer as the cutthroat producer. Patti Lupone and Charles Durning make brief appearances as the mayor and his wife who want to bring Hollywood into their home. The movie has some funny moments, but it seems weak into comparinson with a great comedy like Best in Show.

When I first saw Homicide (not the TV show) the movie, I was impressed by the solid storyline and character involvement. There was also a smattering of wise quips and gems which continues to this day in Mamet's satire of Hollywood, State and Main.The premise, 'a movie crew must shoot in a small New England town and deal with disfunctional stars and an odd assortment of townfolks', is ripe for complications and mischief. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS!I went in expecting a moderately entertaining spoof of a location shoot. What I got was an often hilarious take on insecure movie makers and several interesting subplots driven by believable characters and highlighted by a dream cast.Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker are the problematic stars, each with unique quirks which spell trouble. Bill Macy (who impressed me as an unknown in Homicide) and David Paymer (kind of taking his cue from his role in Qui z Show) are perfect as director and producer respectively, displaying determination, fear, bullying, and damage control. And Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the beleaguered screenwriter, is a ideal as the heart and soul of the troupe. His budding relationship with town resident Rebecca Pidgeon (adorable and sassy) forms the core of this amusing film.The screenplay by director Mamet is so biting and funny throughout, it must surely get an Oscar nomination. While any of the cast could get nominated, one hopes that Hoffman finally gets at least a supporting nod which has eluded him through some deserving performances ie Magnolia, Talented Mr Ripley, and possible Almost Famous.While there have been good movies about the film industry such as The Player and Day for Night, State and Main fills that niche where comedy and romance rule the day.

Director William H. Macy is a lying, manipulating journeyman who is in it for the money. Jewish producer David Paymer has all the sensitivity of a gestapo thug. Female star Sarah Jessica Parker is half airhead, half scheemer who wants more money for baring her boobs.  And male star Alec Baldwin has a thing for bonking underage girls.The only real stereotyped character is screenwriter Phillip Seymour Hoffman, the classic, conflicted, babe-in-the-woods scribe sinking fast as he tries to swim with the barracudas. Then there are the locals, but again, Mamet has spared us most of the cliches.  There are a couple of obligatory Greek chorus types, guys in bib overalls who sit around the local diner spouting New Englandisms. But there are some fresh characters here, too, including local politico Clark Gregg, a lawyer just as opportunistic as any big city guy. Then there is Julia Stiles as the underage vixen who cops to Alec Baldwin's Lolita fetish right off and decides to bed herself a real life movie star. Lastly, there's the film's best character, Rebecca Pidgeon, owner of the local book store, producer of community theater projects and probably, a secret writer herself.  She is smart, savvy, self assured and even sexy in a low key way and that's her strength.There are lots of plot twists and turns in this ensemble film, but what viewers should be warned about is, this isn't a falling down in the aisles comedy. It's a low key movie. What it seems to really be about is the kind of struggle it takes for lower level Hollywood guys to get a film made and make no mistake, they're not making it because they have something to say.  They're making the film just to hang on.In the end, though, the film has a kind of strange sweetness to it, largely because of Pidgeon's terrific performance as the girl who proves that salvation is possible, even for movie people.  But Mamet's message seems to be, if you hope to find that salvation, your only chance is to get out of Dodge and by that he means Hollywood.I recommend this one.

Between utter bewilderment with where this tangled storyline was going, and simply not caring where the mangled storyline was going, it became hard not to just reach for the remote and end the pain of chronic-yawning that set in during my viewing.For a film boasting what one would assume could be a mesmerizing ensemble cast, including such previously great actors as William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Charles Durning, Julia Stiles, Sarah Jessica Parker and (the sometimes good) Alec Baldwin, it was incredibly disconcerting to see most of the actors either sleepwalk or ham-fist their way through their roles.  The dialogue all sounded like it was written for a grade 10 high-school play and delivered with as much believability.  I'd not be surprised to learn that either cue-cards or single takes were used in all scenes it became so unintentionally farcical.  All that was missing was the ba-dump-bump drum-beat following the blatant punch-lines.  Still, Philip Seymour Hoffman actually manages to be good while his comrades sink into the mire.  And I can only assume that Rebecca Pidgeon's part was secured solely by sleeping with the director (her hubby) because she is simply GAWD-AWFUL throughout the film!  Bottom line the result is that I didn't care about the characters, the forced plights of the characters, the fictional film production company, the town, or the film The Old Mill or STATE & MAIN itself.Mamet is a long way from the sharp, taut and biting scriptwork he delivered with GLENGARRY GLENROSS, but not far enough from the lackadaisical directing of THE SPANISH PRISONER or HEIST.

There's nothing more exhausting than an exceedingly clever movie with a dash of intelligence thrown in.  State and Main is the latter--too clever for its own good but with enough intelligence thrown in that many people won't realize it.The premise, in which a movie company arrives in a small town and infects everyone with the showbiz bug, is original enough.  Indeed, everything is original.  There isn't a cliche to be found anywhere in this picture, and on the surface that would appear to be a good thing, but cliches exist for a reason on some level they are true.  The trick is to find the truth of the cliche and wrap it in a cloak of realism for believability.  When you avoid cliches all together, you end up with surrealism, which is not a bad thing in itself, but you have to realize that's what you're doing, or else you will end up with a story that seems unaware of its nature.State and Main seems blissfully unaware of the fact that this movie is on a tangent with reality rather than a parallel course.  Every character speaks lines that draw conspicuous attention to the script.  Isn't the point of dialogue to sound realistic?  Sure, an occasional clever quip spices up the story, and certain characters may be more prone to these phrases, but every line from every character?  At one point, the temperamental star declares, I know my lines.  I just don't know what order they come in.  The director complains, Who designed these costumes?

How can this many people watch such a horrible movie and like it?   I am convinced that the only people that are actually adding comments are people who are either related to David Mamet (screenwriter/director) or diehard fans of his.For me, this movie could not end soon enough.  The cast included a long list of B-level stars, but good actors nonetheless.  I am personally a big fan of Alec Baldwin, David Paymer, and Charles Durning.  But no amount of big names could make up for a horrible script, very poor direction, and the worst cinematic score I have ever heard.Critiquing a movie like this is so hard because there is so much wrong with it.  And I had no intention of writing one until I read all of these rave reviews.I will start with what bothered me the most.  The music.  Not only was it boring and unpleasant to the ears, it was constant.  It began with opening credits and didn't end until the rolling credits.Next, I don't know much about David Mamet.  He had many talented actors to work with, but did not allow them to shine. Instead he turned them into one of his infamous Mamet-bots.  They are so busy trying to be cute that they lose any amount of interest that may have made them successful in the first place (ie. Philip Seymour Hoffman).There are so few moments in the movie that are funny.  The jokes that other people have referred to as clever because they go throughout the movie just don't work.  The big finale of BAZOOMS.COM being worked into the movie was so predictable that it lost any sense of wit.Chemistry between characters was also missing.  Another important element of movies that this one lacks.  The most obvious example is the supposed love interest between Hoffman and Pattie LuPone.  I never saw it or felt it. And who told LuPone that it if she cocked her head and smiled in every seen it would funny.  Its not.  Even the very likable LuPone manages to get under the viewer's skin.There are so many subplots that no single story gets the attention to fully form.  Which is probably a good thing since not a single story was ever interesting enough to grab my attention.From watching this movie this is what I have concluded about David Mamet. After some successful and entertaining movies he is now in a bubble.  He thinks that every idea he has deserves its own movie.  Someone should stop being Mamet's yes-man and let him know how it is.  All of his ideas aren't funny.  In fact, most of them are not.  Mamet appears to have undergone the same change that George Lucas has gone through.  They hit middle age and have lost their edge.This movie is boring, not witty, and a complete waste of time.  I rarely leave a movie with nothing good to say, but this one of them.  This is not artsy or insightful.  Its boring and dull and reflects the thoughts of man out of ideas and insight.

It is not difficult to establish which face Mamet's demons take this time. Hollywood, both a fantasy and an object of scorn, provides the author the perfect chance for a study of a number of characters, an ensemble in the `Grand Hotel' fashion where a multitude of plots and subplots are kept going in admirable pace, and also to include a series of autobiographical references to Mamet's own experience as a playwright turned filmmaker. The idea of the man of integrity selling him to the absolute power of mass entertainment troubled by creative interferences and forced to make banal concessions demanded by the cretins at the service of the industry.Mamet has a gift for dialogue and to provide a memorable line to define a character. If one thinks for a moment that such a dialogue skill would elevate his creations above the average mortals, their actions and behaviors quickly puts them on the level. They have a need for conversation, acute, cynical and witty, more as a defense mechanism to hide their ineptitude and ambition than to reach any form of enlighten. From the soulless director played by the great William H. Macy, who explains his actress `from an interpreter to a creator' why she must show her breasts in a scene, to the producer going around with a law code to uncover the male star's thirst for teenager girls, down to the little town's lawyer eager of a political career. Because Mamet doesn't portrait the Hollywood people as a bunch of corruptors of a pure innocent community; the pillars of that community are already corrupted and the possibility of being in the map is for them a very hard to refuse one.Mamet builds up his drama through opposition. The cosmopolitan film people vs. the narrow-minded provincial townsfolk, the theatre world with its solid literary funds vs. the shallowness of a Hollywood adaptation. Obviously he's more interested in the story of the film-to-be rather to `The Old Mill', and especially in the development of the bond between the playwright Joe (Phillip Seymour Hoffmann) and the sweet store keeper Ann (Rebecca Pidgeon), surnamed White and Black respectively. There are a number of analogies running between the script going to be shoot and the world behind the scenes. It seems that the situations first need to be tied together and make sense in the real world before be considered apt in the shooting script; because `State of Main' can function of a documentary of Mamet's creating process, its sources, purges and exorcisms. His mise-en-scéne of a simulation is like a reformulation of Schopenhauer's division of the world as Will and its representation. Mamet's alter ego, the prestigious author Joe, insists that his film is about `purity' while he struggles all through the process trying to keep his own integrity. He's weakened, tempted and betrayed a number of times, but at the end it's his purity, coped with Amy's intuition what saves him. Amy gives life to one of the most beautiful female characters of the recent cinema, wise and practical, a real muse, able to bind things with the transcendental (she values things if they `have a story' behind, she can restore them their mythical origin) . She's the keeper of the key of the community, its spiritual power.Mamet's storytelling flowingly amusing, invisible without being anonymous, ethical without forcing audiences to take his moral points of view, is comparable to that one of the classic cinema masters. His hero Joe White can be taken off from a Frank Capra film (the Major of the Vermont town is called George Bailey, as Jimmy Stewart in Capra's `It's a Wonderful Life'). A simple, almost naïve man performing a Quixotean task against powerful, evil forces and succeeding with will power and integrity. This type of hero was widely accepted in the 30's and 40's (Meet John Doe, Mr. Deeds goes to town, Sergeant York, etc, etc.) but cinema and audiences are nowadays different, as if a certain malice was requested from both sides. Directors film against their characters, making them failed and unredeemable, and audiences' demand of the real result in protagonists that more than often require our pity to establish a bridge of identification. Recent attempts of portraits of this classical archetype needed to add a distorted element to create verisimilitude (the slow in `Forrest Gump', the freak in `The Truman Show'). In Mamet's fascinating world, this type hero is possible (the whole thing about `showing the breasts' is a war declaration statement about this), and maybe the one and only hope to discern the truth out of the darkness of simulation.

You've seen flashes of this film in Francois Truffaut's Day for Night and Robert Altman's The Player but Mamet's latest effort is no more than an exercise in tedium.  He neither has the storyline nor the players (Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Rebecca Pidgeon wouldn't make you think of Jimmy Stewart and Katherine Hepburn) to pull off this ungracious effort.  Ostensibly about the invasion of bad-mannered Hollywood into a proper New England town, the film manages to throw so many subplots at you that even an earnest viewer would lose out.  That we are suppose to excuse the commission of sex with a minor or the past arson hijinks of one of the main characters and yet be so concerned about telling the truth seems incredulous.  If Mamet had stayed focused on the hard-boiled director (Walt Price, adequately played by William Macy) trying to keep his production on schedule and within budget, there might have been a chance.  But he veers off with the prolonged romance between Joe and Ann (Hoffman and Pidgeon), or the asinine fight over the starlet who won't go topless, or the pompous efforts of the mayor's wife to host an ill-fated dinner, or the preoccupation of star Bob Barrenger (Alec Baldwin) with an underage girl.  The appearance of producer Marty (David Paymer) seemed to bring back the original focus but even he got lost in the final quarter of the film when the desperate Mamet had to try to tie all the loose ends.  There are glimpses of praise, as when the innocent Joe White has to fest up to Ann upon seeing him with the naked Claire (played over the top by Sarah Jane Parker) and the repeated gag lines about the associate producer title, the two old codgers leafing through Variety, the pothole on Main Street that never gets fixed, and matzo mistakenly called crackers.  The performances are run of the mill although David Paymer deserves recognition.  From the high-minded David Mamet, State and Main is a major disappointment, where characterizations enamored him so much he lost sight of what he was trying to say.

When I checked out the DVD, the cover (unlike the stoplight cover shown on this site, a more appropriate design I think), it showed all of the characters in what I felt was a rather dippy-looking ensemble portrait. From that and the tagline, I had the impression this was going to be a tour-de-farce on movie-making. And perhaps it was, on some level, but it was so subtle that it was hard to appreciate when watching at 1000 at night.Granted, I did get a lot of the allegedly wonderful jokes, including the duality of the movies, but the fact is this was largely a romance/morality play, which quite frankly is not what I thought I was getting when I picked this up.Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Rebecca Pidgeon were definitely the stars of this show, despite the obvious attempts at ensemble casting.*POSSIBLE SPOILER, BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY*And here's a question was there a point to the whole mayor and his wife bit? That seemed to go absolutely nowhere. Was it just a social commentary on how people clamor around people with status and money? If so, fine, but it cluttered the film.When I finished this movie, I was frustrated. I was left wanting more; not because I loved what I'd seen and couldn't get enough, but because it felt incomplete to me. Finally, Mamet is the master of subtlety (I loved The Spanish Prisoner), and it shows in his satire. I'll concede that there are probably some gems of humor buried in the dialogue were I to go back and give it another viewing. But movies shouldn't cater to the video-owning crowd; it should work on the first run. I still find tidbits in movies that I never caught before, and it's great when I find them. But that's usually in a movie that had plenty of obvious upfront material to keep me coming back for more. If I hadn't read the comments about needing a sharp ear and intelligence to fully appreciate the movie, I never would have known that was the case. I would have written it off as a half-bake movie, which it must not be since it has such a loyal following.I think I might sit down and watch it again when I'm more awake and know what kind of movie is in store.

It can't make up its mind. It teases us, but tells us nothing. We never find out why the film crew had to suddenly leave location in New Hampshire (it's mentioned as a tease several times). There is no `extras' try-out scene for the locals, though it's pushed in our faces several times. There are no examples of the locals selling their souls to be in the movie as promised by the ads. Philip Seymour Hoffman (usually an excellent actor) is painful to watch as the hapless screenwriter who has a very awkward, unbelievable romance with the town bookkeeper, who in the course of two days decides she'll dump her attorney fiancee for Philip, even though she finds him with a naked Sarah Jessica Parker.It's a small town, but no one comes running when Alec's car overturns and hits the town's only traffic light (there are houses 30 feet away)?!

A woman accidentally rubs off half of the message, so she clearly rewrites it in the correct spot, the 12th, in green ink. Later, the message is shown to be written on the 13th in green ink and the original message is merely in faded red ink, not half-erased. How did that happen? Later on, during a major rainstorm, the fire station's Dalmatian somehow enters the bookstore, completely dry. How did he get in? How did he stay dry? Soon after, two characters lock themselves out of the bookstore, but can't figure that they should enter the same way the dog did, however that was.

In this tale, a Hollywood film crew invades the idyllic hamlet of Waterford, Vermont, determined to capture on celluloid the simple bucolic virtues of a bygone era.  The only problem is that those involved with the making of this film-within-a-film lack the requisite innocence themselves to do justice to the theme they purport to be exploring.  They are all typical products of the crass Hollywood culture &#150; boorish, self-obsessed and thoroughly amoral.  All except the writer of the piece that is, Joseph Turner White (played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman), the one character who is not only in touch with his cravings for a return to innocence, but who passes the moral test laid out for him along those lines at the end.`State and Main' is a clever film, a cute film, a likable film &#150; it just isn't a very FUNNY film.  The Mamet specialty &#150; flat, monotone, emotionless line readings &#150; becomes grating and irritating after awhile.  Both the small town rubes and the big city elitists come across as little more than tired stereotypes who really don't have anything particularly funny to say.  As a result, most of the attempts at humor simply fall flat.  We've seen these characters and situations countless times before &#150; the temperamental star making exorbitant financial demands, the lecherous leading man endangering the production with his reckless sexual dalliances, the harried producers and directors fighting a constant transcontinental phone battle with demanding studio heads `back on the coast.'  And it just isn't all that interesting.  Part of the problem, I think, is that Mamet never really exploits or explores the setting he's chosen.  Most of the townsfolk emerge as minor, background characters at best, with the possible exception of Rebecca Pidgeon as Annie, Joe's eventual love interest.  Pidgeon, who looks uncannily like Marlo Thomas in her `That Girl' days, seems sweet as all get out, but the atonal delivery of most of her lines hampers the interest we might otherwise find in her character.     Actually, none of these characters are very interesting &#150; or very funny.  In fact, most of them seem rather pathetic when you get right down to it, and Mamet fails to provide the satirical wit and bite that would mitigate some of their unpleasantness.  He doesn't generate the kind of out-and-out, hearty laughter that Christopher Guest derived from his examinations of rural America in movies like `Waiting For Guffman' and `Best of Show.'   Mamet's take is, in many ways, so cynical that he seems to have forgotten to engender the kind of affection for his people that helps keep condescension at bay.  Or, perhaps, it is really so much simpler than that &#150; maybe he merely neglected to write any truly funny material this time around.

The movie has no specific target,  poking gentle fun at both Hollywood and small town values.  Many of the jokes and situations, such as those about the vague functions of executive producers, the penchant of the Alec Baldwin character for teenage girls, Sarah Jessica Parker declining to go topless, and the disastrous dinner party organised by the Mayor's wife would be quite at home in mainstream TV comedy.  Since, with the genuinely satirical Wag the Dog as a notable exception, David Mamet's reputation as a stage and cinema director/writer rests mainly on tense, existential dramas featuring loaded, frequently harsh dialogue, the lighter tone of this movie has surprised and disappointed some. But, while it may lack the gravitas of much of his previous work, State and Main has also shed a lot of the portentious staginess of those earlier movies, which often created the impression that the action was taking place in a lifeless no-mans-land (for me, even in such apparently down to earth movies as Glengarry Glen Ross and House of Games). The movie also has genuine, but again oh-so-gentle, love interest between Joseph White,  the writer, ably portrayed by versatile Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and local, Ann Black, played by Mamet's wife, Rebecca Pidgeon. (Hadn't previously noticed that - White and Black!)  There has been comment that making the main male protagonist a writer was an act of egotism on Mamet's part; but it is more of a joke against himself,  since White may be a liberal intellectual who gets the girl, but he is also a bumbling, naive tyro. In fact, of course, the theme of writer as standard bearer for idealism and culture against the Hollywood forces of  money-grubbing and vulgarity goes back a long way.All in all, this is movie to be enjoyed for its for its surface qualities of humour, humanity and happy ending; rather than looking for deeper meanings.

Not just any writer, but a morose, verbose, Faber-published playwright involved with Rebecca Pidgeon.  Because JT White is the centre of the movie, its anti-Hollywood thrust is neutered despite all the venality, criminality and egotism, it is possible for small-town values to make even the smallest dent in Hollywood Babylon, for heart and morality to check even one person, while the industry goes on happily bludgeoning the minds of millions.  Mamet presumably intends to be 'ironic' in an Altman-like way, but 'State and Main' isn't, for two reasons, one good for us, the other less so.  'State' belongs to a 'venerable' tradition of movies about movies, movies which dare to expose the corruption and cynicism of Tinseltown.  By mocking Hollywood, these films are asserting their own integrity and intelligence.  In this view, Hollywood films are formulaic and hypocritical; Hollywood films about Hollywood, by definition, are not.   The truth is that Hollywood films about Hollywood are so familiar and common that they are a genre onto themselves, and hence formulaic.  As with any genre, the filmmaker has two choices - to rehash the old cliches, or to make them new, give them a new twist, subvert them.  When Altman made 'the Player', his plot and flat cynicism was new - it was the first film about Hollywood that was genuinely appalled by the industry, rather than covertly self-glorifying.  'State' is not immediately true to Mamet films as we know them - the dialogue is not elliptical or overly enigmatic; the plot and its workings aren't foregrounded; the mise-en-scene isn't impenetrably murky.  The film is, however, very familiar, like 'Living in Oblivion' - with all the familiar problems with logistics and ego problems.  Where Decillo in 'Oblivion', however, emphasised the nightmare and mania present in filmmaking where art meets commerce, reaching a kind of muted Fellinian grandeur, Mamet's hacks are a bunch of cynical businessmen who want to get the job done.  As the audience for this kind for film will be those people already jaundiced against Hollywood, Mamet is playing to his audience as safely as any slam-bam blockbuster.  Even White's trauma is weakened by its over-similarity to 'Barton Fink' (minus madness), and the fact that he sounds like an atrocious writer anyway.  Likewise, this talented cast are scarcely stretched by the light 'satirical' jibes.  Getting Alec Baldwin and Sarah Jessica Parker to make fun of themselves is not quite the same as Bruce Willis and Julia Roberts.The good reason 'State' doesn't reach Altman is that Mamet the human being gets in the way of Mamet the cynic.  Like Godard's films with Anna Karina, Mamet seems to be absolutely in love with his wife, and, more importantly, conveys that love to us.  He is simply riveted by her beautiful face, its quiet expressivity, its generosity, openness and mysteriousness, those huge eyes and that rapturous smile that can suggest irony, disappointment, hope and joy at the same time.  It is a winning performance. If Hoffman's character feels like a stock device, Hoffman the actor responds to Pidgeon's unique mixture of distance and warmth, and they make such an adorable couple you're willing to forgive the overall cop-out, or the elitist assumption that sees her theatre win out over the film people for White's soul (the mock trial where she practices with her drama group).  I also liked the stuff about the suspicious fires in 1960, and the mysterious failure of the football team in 75. "}]
