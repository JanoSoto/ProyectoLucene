It is not. But it's tremendously low imdb rating makes me wonder who the heck is voting here. Pret-a-Porter is a pretty good Robert Altman film that is no better or worse than Short Cuts, which, while I feel it is a good film, I also think it is overrated. This one is, however, heavily underrated, and they both got the same imdb score from me 7/10 = 3/4 stars.This is another attempt to make another Nashville. There's a humongous ensemble cast of actors, some of the best on the planet, a couple of the best who ever lived. The screenwriter doesn't connect it all very well, and lots of the characters seem superfluous or underdeveloped, unlike in Nashville where even the characters who are only in a couple of scenes are as familiar to the viewer as a close friend. I would particularly have liked the Danny Aiello/Teri Garr section to have been removed. It falls pretty flat. The Sophia Loren/Marcello Mastrioanni section, the section that most film buffs are going to be excited for, also plops by its end. And Kim Basinger, a good actress, truly deserving her L.A. Confidential Oscar, is not very good as the Southern U.S. reporter her accent is difficult to get around, and her character is often annoying, too. Sometimes, though, her pieces succeed.Many other of the vignettes succeed quite well, although there are never any fireworks about to shoot off. The Tim Robbins/Julia Roberts plot is very funny. The three publishers, Sally Kellerman, Tracy Ullman, and Linda Hunt's attempts to sign photographer Milo (Stephen Rea) to their magazine are all very humorous. The love quadrangle between the two designers, Forest Whitaker and Richard E. Grant, and their lovers is very good, also. Anouk Aimee's section is also great, maybe the best part (Rupet Everett is good, also). I loved her so much in La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2.  I was aching for her and Marcello Mastrioanni to interact.The ending is truly fantastic. It is very well directed and filmed. It's a good film.

Seldom do films delight and amuse us at this level.   But this is like a Woody Allen film either you love it or hate it.  Since the story is too complicated to explain (and the best thing about this film), I'm sticking to mostly non-plot aspects in this review.One of the challenges in your first viewing will be this film's utter lack of exposition.  You will be asked to board this train while it is moving; in fact, you will need to leap from track to track. The story is not unfolded as much as it is thrown at you in pieces.  Two minutes after you are tossed into a conversation (already in progress), you will be asked to join another.  Unless you have a mind as competitively poised as a super-model, you'll miss much of the movie the first time.Don't let the immersion in the world of fashion fool you into thinking this is a movie `about' fashion.  Fashion is merely a backdrop, a setting for Altman to play his scenes.  That he so thoroughly masters his subject is merely a tribute to his intelligence and sophistication.Like Milos Forman in `The Firemen's Ball,' Altman has created a wonderful menagerie of human foibles with which to lampoon us.  Our pettiness, our lack of shame, our corruption and our low regard for each other are portrayed so truthfully and cleverly that we don't notice who is the real subject of the satire.  We smugly assume it is the fashion world on trial.Even the opening credits were fun - what a collection of personalities (all stitched on garment labels)!.  Every casting decision was a good one; every performance was satisfying.  The only thing funnier than Danny Aiello in drag, is watching him being told he looks like Barbra Streisand.  And the only thing funnier than that is realizing it's true.While we're trying to figure out a murder, we are also being dazzled by the constellation of world stars of all kinds parading before us.  That Altman dared to attempt such a feat (the group photo at Versailles alone must have been a challenge) is not half as astonishing as that he pulled it off.  But the stars, too, are merely a backdrop to funny stories and situations.  No one but Altman could make an Elsa Klensch cameo so surprisingly hilarious. The interview about the pouf skirts was just plain funny.  But will most of the audience appreciate it?  `I doubt it.'Another delight is Altman's pervasive references to clothing, so dominant you will miss half of them.  A cab driver, identifying a murderer, tells the police `all white people look alike.'  How does he tell them apart?  `By their clothes.'  Film is confiscated from a fashion shoot, because the murder suspect was inadvertently captured in the background.  But his face was cutoff in every shot.  `We don't know what he looks like,' the detective complains.  `But we know what he was wearing.'  Every conversation, every plot, each detail is so thoroughly self-referencing to fashion; but mostly, there are dozens of funny moments.  Even the red herring of murder is based on our mistaking an innocent fashion item for an omen of death.

Both address the hypocrisy and viciousness of a big money-making industry, by interweaving a number of loosely connected stories acted by a large celebrity cast. Some of these stories work better than others, in both films; as a previous reviewer noted, in Pret-Ã -Porter, they all hinge on the central theme of betrayal, with a cumulative effect that is saddening as well as amusing.The principal difference between the two films lies in the way they end. Nashville is closed off (to my mind, unconvincingly) by an assassination at a political rally. Ready to Wear ends with a breathtakingly beautiful, even erotic acting-out of the story of the Emperor's New Clothes, where almost none of the fashion-industry types realize that the bankrupt designer has clothed all of her models in...nothing. The only one who does get the joke is the clueless and incompetent reporter (Kim Basinger, from Texas, doing a fine retake on Geraldine Chaplin's annoying role in Nashville), who stalks off in a huff.Apparently lots of critics stalked off in a huff, too. That's too bad, since the film has lots of good qualities. But you miss the point if you don't realize that it's all leading up to that big shaggy-dog-story punchline.

Altman's confidence in dispensing with the conventions of plot, character development, the classic forms of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy jumps off the Eiffel Tower, girl moves in with Godzilla, is as stunning as the final scene. The sheer pleasure of watching Altman's usual suspects perform at the top of their game is enough reason to watch the movie. I will never look at Forest Whitaker and Rupert Everett in the same way.

It's a typical Robert Altman film, with multiple story lines, fast cutting from one setup to another, and overlapping soundtracks, which all make it hard to follow at the cinema, and very suitable for rental so it can be replayed. It would take too long even to begin to summarise the subplots and characters, but in addition to a galactically stellar cast; there's a host of guest celebrities, including lots of couturiers; and of course dozens of models on and off the catwalk, in and out of designer clothes, and in the climactic scene without clothes at all. It is always healthy - both for laughers and laughees - to laugh at powerful people who take themselves too seriously; and by poking fun at the fashion industry and its surrounding media circus, Altman is performing a social service, as well as being a true artist. But I don't find his satire as cruelly biting as some people do. He treats some characters sympathetically or neutrally - eg  the designer played by Anouk AimÃ©e and Marcello Mastroianni's mystery figure.  And even the extreme characters - eg Richard E Grant's screamingly gay designer or Kim Basinger's gushing TV reporter - are only a little more exaggerated than some real-life equivalents.The final nude catwalk parade is not only a visually delightful and neat solution to the problem of a designer having lost her collection; but is also a postmodern take on the fairytale of the emperor's new clothes - nowadays, the crooks wouldn't have to pretend they were making clothes for the vain emperor, but would be able to sell him nudity, so long as it had a trendy designer label!

I nuzzle the kind, bark at the greedy and bite scoundrels! &#x96; DiogenesLike most of Robert Altman's films, Pret-a-Porter involves a large cast of characters gathering together to put on a performance, in this case a prestigious fashion show in Paris.The film was marketed as a satire, but it really isn't. This is fashion industry as scatology, a world of sh*t in which everything is grotesque and warped. As with Diane Arbus' famous photographs on freaks, Altman deliberately blurs the boundaries between the ideal and the abnormal, the beautifully formed and the deformed, the feces and the sanitary, the inside and the outside.All the characters here are thus freaks in some way, all part of the same freakish human circus. There are dwarf attendants and magazine editors, transvestites, cross-dressers, lesbians, gays, the obese, the pregnant, adulterers, illegitimate babies, mortuary attendants, and a multitude of abrasive caricatures. Mixed in with these are the ideal bodies of the celebrities, the exposed unnatural/natural bodies of the models, identical twins who exchange their sexual partners, film-star parodies, television personalities and original film-stars reliving previous roles.Altman then contrasts modern sex icons (Basinger, Roberts etc), with ageing, disintegrating sex icons of the past (Sophia Loren, Lauren Bacall etc), and goes out of his way to tarnish surface beauty by imbuing the film's sex bombs with abrasive personalities.The much derided abrasiveness of the film is therefore intentional. Altman isn't just dealing with caricatures, he's dealing with the grotesque. Of course grotesque art is, by definition, the least ideal form, always a war of attraction and repulsion. As such, the reoccurring motifs here are dogs, animals and dog feces. More than juvenile poop jokes, Altman's recalling the scatological traditions of Diogenes, the dog philosopher.Diogenes was associated with public outbursts and obscenity. His ragged, unashamedly dirty existence radiated disrespect and contempt for all who gazed upon him. But while he was an animal, putrid and filthy, he was nevertheless more civilised than his cultured audience. In a similar fashion, everyone in this film is held under the contemptible gaze of Diogenes, whose mischievous dog feces show scorn for an intrusive and aggressive kind of, not so much modern culture (typified by television, celebrity, photography, fame and fashion &#x96; the usual boring targets of satire), but the hypocrisy of all culture.In the film, both television and photography are implicitly connected by characters accidentally stepping in dog feces. These accidents occur in both private and public places, playfully linking the home, studio and streets with a media culture which both intrudes on privacy (exposing shameful human behaviours, foibles and frailties) and disguises these behaviours by glitzing and glamming them up. So Altman is less concerned about the fashion industry, than about what garments and technology alternatively hide and expose, the prevalence of his symbolic doggy poop serving to bring the high down low. Everything is grotesque whether you're on or off the catwalk.The film ends with a nude catwalk scene, one of Altman's most brilliant sequences. Here, models walk fully nude whilst the words You're so beautiful the way you are hum on the soundtrack. The sequence derides the commodification of beauty, serves as an admittance that humanity is as grotesque as its ornaments/apparels, works as a dig at the fashion industry's obsession with authenticity (the true inner subject/self, the stripped down ego or essence), and of course points toward the end result of all fashion-as-fetish-wear total, naked sex. More than this, though, the sequence suggests that there is beauty in freakishness and freakishness in beauty, which is why a strange aura of both life and death radiates from this sequence. The catwalk models are like clones, cold stick figures, one of which is pregnant. The pregnant model speaks of a mystery about birth and something new, but she is also the least sexual of the models. Conversely, the others are like zombies, dead, crawling out of a tomb, yet are beautifully sexualised.This blurring, this confusion (ugliness in beauty, beauty in ugliness) is the very point of Grotesque art. Unlike the satirist, the grotesque artist does not analyse and instruct in terms of right and wrong or true and false (satire=logical, grotesque=irrational), nor does he attempt to distinguish between these. On the contrary, he is concerned about demonstrating their inseparability. Satire generally aims at three reactions from the audience - laughter, anger or disgust - but it aims to produce these separately. The grotesque, however, produces a reaction of confusion. With satire, there is an alternation or distinction between laughter and the gross evil which arouses anger. With the grotesque, however, laughter, hatred and anger seem to meld.Beyond this there are references to Funny Face and Blow Up (guess why), and Altman re-enacts a scene from De Sica's Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow with the same actors (Loren and Mastroianni). It's like the two lovers from De Sica's film (itself a film in which Loren and Mastroianni played multiple characters) stepped out of it and resumed their tale 40 years later in older bodies. Surprisingly, the same lead actors from Fellini's La Dolce Vita also appear, adding a dark tinge to Fellini's tale of those seeking the good life.Tactics like this create a further effect. The characters lose weight, becoming flat, depth-less images. Consider when the real Elsa Klensch is interviewed by Kim Basinger who plays an Elsa Klensch character or when real celebrities like Cher and Harry Bellefonte briefly appear but yet still come across as empty, screen representations of themselves. The film paints a world obsessed with the image, but stresses that there are few authentic images. The supermodels of the 90s were clones, destratified personae, simulations of imagined and imagined bodies, part of man's ritualised games of narcissism. By the films end, even a naked repudiation of this narcissism becomes a form of narcissism.7.5/10 &#x96; Two viewings required.

It is my opinion that the worst film from Robert Altman is still the best film of the year (with rare exceptions) and so, naturally, I would recommend this film to anyone.  However, Director Altman does NOT make films for everyone.  He often makes films for the 'Advanced' film-goer.  His work is often dis-jointed and overlapping to an extent that it requires one to actually ay attention to the goings' on rather than to spoon-feed the answers to the audience.  Couple this with his tendency to allow the plot and the character to meander, evolving slowly over the course of the film and you often get a movie that is distinctly 'un-Hollywood', which can turn some film goers off.  So I would recommend that you not only sit through this film, but allow yourself to actually watch it without any preconceived ideas of how a movie is supposed to be.  Then I think you will find a witty, sexy satire that is more about our own vanity and betrayal than it is about the fashion industry.

Everyone appears to be betraying someone else in  this film, whether a spouse, partner, or close relation, and ultimately wrapped in the naked fashion parade -- the industry betraying its consumers.  There are weak aspects of the plot to be sure, but also some great performances -- Richard E Grant stands out as a camp classic, while Rupert Everett convincingly plays straight.

He was one of the few important auteurs of a profession celebrating its first centennial. Again, the wise filmmaker's satirical approach (directed on this opportunity to the fashion world) was misunderstood. This time, the maestro pointed his finger to consumerism on a global scale, by covering a convention of the haute couture circle, in which fashion was the vehicle to expose the dehumanised materialism of contemporary world.Starting with a prologue at Dior's in Moscow (which could be Rome or Paris), Altman described a multinational microcosm defined by its unrestrained marketing of material goods. Altman did not underestimate fashion as a key element in our lives as a matter of fact, he used fashion as the clue to gain access to the film. As expected, PrÃªt-Ã -porter was not a paean to designers, models, photographers or fashion magazine editors. After the convention's creator unexpectedly dies, Altman and co-writer Barbara Shulgasser aimed at the surface of the fashion world, searching for its essence, for a trace of humanity, and led us to an unexpected ending, which is a sort of purification, a baring of the bodies and souls. Altman, at 70, knew very well that mankind's main alternative was (and is) the transparent ethics that radiates from pure spirits committed to preserve life on this planet, beyond fabrics and fashions.To tell the story of this garment catharsis, Altman used as his stylistic technique the superficiality that permeates the milieu he's describing (one I know after working in a couple of such events in my youth.) Everything is bright and beautiful, but somehow it seems as if nothing is happening. The audience is denied all the myths that have led many designers and models to haughtiness, so their attitudes become more vacuous, and their incentive to rapacious consumerism is more obvious. Being unable to speak of art or the fashion essence in a contemporary setting where commerce rules, Altman used a fragmented narrative, with overlapped dialogues &#x96;often improvised- as in his other reflections on the crisis of communication, a central theme in Nashville. Altman is one of the few filmmakers who is able to reunite large casts and create characters of high sociological value (mainly in McCabe & Mrs. Miller, Nashville, A Wedding, Short Cuts and Gosford Park, and to a lesser degree in HealtH and The Player), but he is also averse to psychological realism, that old strategy inherited from the 19th century novel, and that some people still ask for in our post-post-modern world...In this film, Altman relied on famous faces to construct a game of facades with few strokes, choosing among the best of them those who are able to create a believable character with a few significant details, those who can go from the subtle &#x96;as the wine spot on a reporter's sweater- to the pompous, as the dark glasses of the Irish photographer or Sophia Loren's hats. On the other hand, he relied on the audiences' own information, making them interact with the film, adding data or making associations. For example, only those who have seen Vittorio de Sica's Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow and Sunflower, can enjoy to the full the cinematic homage to Sophia and Marcello Mastroianni. Their story echoes Sunflower, while there is a reprise of Sophia's strip-tease in Yesterday&#x85; with a different (and sad) effect on Marcello; or if you have been in an event like the one in the film, you may remember people as the characters played by Tim Robbins and Julia Roberts, two reporters who spend the whole event making love in their hotel rooms.PrÃªt-Ã -porter is a good film, which contains some of the typical Altmanian digressions that some do not enjoy. But, as Andrei Tarkovsky once said When you are in front of a really major figure, you have to accept him with all his weaknesses, which become distinctive qualities of his aesthetics.

The writing misses, not that it doesn't create interesting sequences or moments, but it seems to go no where. But no one does this type of film better than Altman and even when Altman is bad there is always a lot to look at.The film moves quickly but it always leaves you wanting more. The characters of Kellerman, Ullman and Hunt had they been developed could have been a film within a film and been an interesting comedic farce. Unfortunately that possibility is never realized. Stephen Rea's character is just plain annoying, there's no exaggeration and no depth and it appears he has one expression. Forest Whitaker is always a pleasure to watch because of the depth of his persona. Ruppert Everett does nothing more than come off as a spoiled little boy playing in an adult world. One bright note is Chiara Mastrioanni.But then you move to the pro's. Loren and Mastroianni are delicious to watch. You can't help but watch the Diva Loren walk and talk. Mastroianni's puppy dog routine is endearing because it harks back to the film history they have created together. The homage to Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow is particularly of note, not just because one is amazed at how well Loren still looks but because Altman takes the scene and puts a rather timely note to it. Lauren Bacall seems totally wasted as she wanders in and out of the goings on with no purpose. Jean Rochefort and Anouk Aimee probably get the acting laurels because they both manage to underplay while everyone else is over blown. Julia Roberts and Tim Robbins although set in an interesting situation become tiresome and their characters rather void of any color. Kim Bassinger is perfect as the announcer because she completely conveys her inability to comprehend the fashion world and still be in awe of those who inhabit that world. Danny Aiello's turn is probably the best realized character for laughs in the film while Teri Garr is totally wasted.But that's the point of the movie. The fashion world is over blown and Altman has chronicled that in this film and yet at the same time managed to pay homage to some incredible film careers, films, and legends.

The more films of Altman one sees, the more one appreciates this wonderful man and his unique ability to create witty, cinematic essays on subjects such as weddings (A Wedding), the music industry (Nashville), the movie industry (The player), soldiers/doctors during wars (MASH) to name a few, all with his stock ensemble of actors who often return to play bit parts in his works. What amazes me is that these actors return to play anti-heroes, often doing roles that are real and often portraying the follies of human beings rather than larger-than-life characters in movies that the average film-goer may mistakenly dismiss as droll.Is Pret a porter a film on the fashion industry? Look closely, and the film merely uses the fashion industry as a backdrop for painting a larger canvas of human foibles. For instance, the dog faeces in this film (just as bird droppings in Altman's Brewster McCloud) provide humor, social commentary and linkages between scenes that would seem disjointed in Altman's deliberate attempts at jumping from one scene to another and back in the midst of a conversation that other directors would have preferred to run its course. There is a method in Altman's madness. Pret a porter while taking swipes at the fashion industry, is equally poking fun at journalists who send live reports on the phone sitting in hotel rooms and translating TV news, of the hotel industry who provide identical suites with different fancy names in the same hotel, of high flying journalists/executives who fuss on details of their hotel rooms in identical ways by just throwing their weight around and appear discerning, of TV commentators (Kim Bassinger's character) who know very little of the subject they specialize in, etc. It is also a film that provides humor to the attentive viewer The murderer must have died from jumping in to the Seine. If he survived the jump, the pollution would have killed him or the lengthy conversation on the pouffe skirts, which ends in Are you pouffe? The Julia Roberts-Tim Robbins sequences provide social commentary on contemporary love that goes beyond the world of fashion, as a counterpoint to the parallel sequence of Mastroanni and Loren as lovers of a past generation.Though Altman has made better movies (McCabe and Mrs Miller,  A wedding and Nashville), this one is not an insignificant work. Linda Hunt, Tim Robbins, Julia Roberts may be playing roles of frail, pathetic personalities but they play those roles with sincerity and flourish. In my view, the film uses fashion as a metaphor.

That one star is Kim Basinger. With her spirited portrayal of FAD-TV anchor Kitty Potter, she is the ringmaster of Altman's circus of multiple twisted and interlocking rings.Is Ready-to-Wear a great movie, or what? What! No, it's not great, nor even very good.Is it entertaining? Not really, not in any coherent sense. If you try to get involved in the plot, you will only get dog-doo on your shoe.But it can be fun to watch, if nothing else to play the game called, Come on, who IS that? Robert Altman enjoys such godlike status among the Holloywood elite, that he was able to enlist some of the most sought-after A-list players of three generations to perform for him in Paris, or at least to show up for cameos. To play this game, print out the IMDb full cast list, then try to spot each one of the listed players in the movie.Finally, even if you decide to fast-forward through Ready-to-Wear, do slow down for the climactic runway scene. It is well worth the price of a rental, not that this scene has very much to do with the rest of the story (such story as there is). This scene does prove that if you are Robert Altman in 1994 (or Walerian Borowczyk in 1974) you can stage an extended scene of naked supermodels for a feature film, merely because you wish to. Rating 7/10. Somehow, the one movie that Ready-to-Wear most reminds me of is And the Ship Sails on (E la nave va), 1983, by Federico Fellini -- despite Fellini's cast of unknowns, and its low-budget operatic staging.

It'll be just like Nashville, in other words, another Altman tour de force. Oddly and sadly, it's nothing of the sort. Ready to Wear loses its way early, and drifts aimlessly along for its lengthy 133 minute runtime. The characters lack the depth of his other films; they're poorly defined and you never really feel you get to know them. The dialogue is shallow and lacks bite.

There's just nothing special here--the story isn't special, the style in which the story is told isn't special, the cinematography is straight and bland, the sense of reality and improvisation is missing, and the signature Altman overlapping dialog is nowhere to be heard. It's like Altman wrote the script and then handed it over to Chris Columbus to direct. Like I said before, I wanted to like it.

The characters... some are rather undeveloped, but I have a hunch that this is on purpose. 2 hours is not enough to form a picture of a person, and so I think Altman made them so undeveloped because these are, when all is said and done, regular people. A large amount of correspondents, a few model designers, a bit of these, a few of those... the only character which seemed foolishly vague in my opinion was the Communist Italian. Apart from that, I only saw people that I would see on the street, or on some show, or some that I wouldn't see at all, that merely write stories which others publish and get credited for.The theme of fashion design seems to be quite irrelevant here, or rather, it serves as the backdrop for an array of the aforementioned characters. Who cares about a fashion show when such drama is going on? Who cares who designed what dress when a mischievous Irishman is so irreverently teasing famous personages in such a hilarious manner? Who cares what outfit was voted best when two complete strangers are trying to sort out the mess their arrival was? All in all, I believe that this movie fits comfortably among Altman's successes. The story is gripping, logical, and possesses a vivid array of characters reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's films (yes, not exactly chronically correct Guy Ritchie came later, but I just wanted to make the image.), and funny.

They make one movie that isn't as great as their many other masterpieces and BAM! &#x97; it's thrown into the trash heap, classified as a miserable pile of dookie. Some (critics) like to designate a less successful film as an interesting mess; what they really mean, though, is that they can't decide if they liked the film or not &#x97; but one thing is for sure it wasn't as good as (insert Oscar adored movie from a multiple-award winning director here). It's unavoidable &#x97; everyone wants an Orson Welles to have a career full of Citizen Kanes, nothing experimental, nothing tricky. Sigh. People are human, you know. It's hard to make a masterpiece! As an admirer of Robert Altman's work (Nashville, Short Cuts), even the slightest of a failure remains watchable to me. Is it the overlapping dialogue? The devastatingly star-studded casts? The magnificent giganticness of the plot, the characters, the script? Not all of Altman's films are equally chatty &#x97; he is capable of going gloomy and dry (Thieves Like Us, The Long Goodbye) &#x97; but when he wants to go all out he goes all out. The Player, a Hollywood satire, featured nearly sixty celebrities making random cameos for the sake of making a cameo. Nashville had twenty-four main characters, all of them somehow as well-characterized as the last. Ready to Wear, a fashion week parody, comes directly after The Player and Short Cuts &#x97; Altman's biggest successes of the 1990s &#x97; and it continues the trend of a large cast and cheerfully rambling dialogue. But arriving in the shadow of these terror twins can only be described as a sort of curse. Three is hardly a magic number, and Ready to Wear learned that all too soon, considering the critical destruction it faced upon its release. Altman died in 2006, his legacy coming in the form of the films I mentioned earlier; Ready to Wear, in the meantime, got filed away in the reject folder.I've spoiled myself these last few years. I have only sat through Altman movies Ebert promised I would like &#x97; and I have yet to see one that I haven't admired in some way or another. Ready to Wear is my first wild card (it currently holds a 26% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, panned for not being mean enough, not being focused enough, etc). 133 minutes later, I can confidently say that I don't understand the lack of love for Ready to Wear.Fine, the humor isn't as sharp as it could be (this is supposed to be a satire, after all). Okay, Altman and his co-screenwriter, Barbara Shulgasser, aren't decisive enough to really make consistent characters out of the massive ensemble. But I like Ready to Wear, along with its hiccups. Things to like include the setting, Paris, of all places; how extensive this fictional fashion week is, loaded with brilliantly timed cameos and dynamic catwalk sequences (soundtracked with Salt-N-Peppa, BjÃ¶rk, more); and, most significantly, the cast, which is possibly too ravishing to resist, including Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni, Lauren Bacall, (a scene-stealing) Kim Basinger, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Forest Whitaker, Tracey Ullman, Sally Kellerman, Lili Taylor, Teri Garr and Lyle Lovett. Some portray insiders, some out, all compelling.Problematic and sprawling as it is, Ready to Wear keeps us busy and keeps things charming &#x97; finding ourselves entertained is accidental. There's so much going on, so much to enjoy. So stop, please stop, thinking and comparing and underrating Ready to Wear because of Nashville and Short Cuts and M*A*S*H and The Player. You'll have a better time that way. There's much to savor. Altman pays homage to 1963's Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow by recreating its striptease scene with its now senior stars, Loren and Mastroianni, and the final sequence, featuring a scad of gorgeous (and nude) models, cements the film's carefree approach to do whatever the hell it wants. Sure, you should watch one of the Altman greats first (I won't name them again), but Ready to Wear acts as a smart pastime.

It's one of his big ensemble comedies that probably largely came together in the editing room, but it doesn't cohere the way Nashville or Short Cuts does. I get the mental image of Robert Altman throwing darts at a dart board and seeing what sticks, and with this film not much does. This is Altman's attempt at a French sex farce, and he gives his film an international flavor by casting big-time stars like Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni and Anouk Aimee, but he acts like simply casting them is enough and forgets to give them any material to work with.Perhaps the biggest problem with Pret a Porter is that Altman satirizes something that itself is already largely a satire the world of high fashion. Fashion is a big industry, no doubt, but it makes a rather meager subject for satire, and Altman doesn't seem to have much of a point to make about the industry anyway. It's fun for a while to just watch goofy people walking around saying and doing goofy things, but without a stronger script to anchor the action, the fun in people watching wears thin after a while.The large cast features a ton of famous faces, some of them actors Altman had worked with before (Tim Robbins, Sally Kellerman, Lili Taylor, Richard E. Grant) and many new to Altman's world (Julia Roberts, Tracy Ullmann, Stephen Rea, Linda Hunt, Danny Aiello, Teri Garr). But really, the only one who made much impression on me was Kim Basinger, who gets the Geraldine Chaplin role from Nashville, playing a fish-out-of-water reporter who seems to be everywhere at once and sidelines unsuspecting subjects with impromptu interviews.

In one moment, Altman can make you sit back and go ah ha, feeling like a sober man once again.  Ready to Wear starts you out as a drunk, and at the end, you feel even more drunk.  Do not see this film. Please, let it disappear in film history, leaving us only with the best of the best. "},{"Title":"Here's the Poop!

Hot lips bears her breasts again, Sophia faints, Kim Basinger plays herself, one wonders why Aiello donned drag - though he is hysterical with Terri Garr, and the fashions are grrish.  Characters keep stepping in dog waste and that is annoying but its part of the film's offbeat charm.  This film grows on you...put it on for a while and feel like a model!  By the way, my favorite in the film is Linda Hunt...wish you made more films!  Seeing you on your knees Linda was very funny!

Altman, whose work I've always mistrusted, shows his true colors here. His take on the superficiality of the fashion world is as superficial as fashion itself! I guess our auteur thinks shots of feet stepping in poo will subtly express a righteous disdain for the fashion world. Mr.Altman, taking cheap shots at obvious (and incredibly easy) targets is not clever. Your lack of subtlety (and understanding) of your subject amazes. Your trademark intertwining of several plot lines does not work here. Know this--its a simple topic, really, and deserves a simple approach. Even your self righteous disgust at the superficiality of the fashion world is misplaced. This marks you as an intellectual snob (I just always knew your were).Fashion is silly, but it's also fun, and it's more important to us than we care to admit. You show no empathy for any of your many characters,you just set them up like bowling pins and proceed to knock them down as noisily and messily as possible. Some of your most unpleasant traits persist here--this is clearly a director's statement, your gig, and the actors, famous as they are, are just chess pieces to be moved about according to whim--is this sort of power amusing to you? The story line is so poorly thought out, that it just doesn't exist. You are clearly annoyed with the idea of celebrity, but guess what--you're one too--don't we get any fun out of status--are we that proud? Why the hostility towards fashion people? I suppose they're not thinking the sorts of important thoughts that you deem necessary to justify one's existence.This is a great masturbatory mess of a movie, a so called social critique/fantasy that tells us nothing and goes nowhere. Even the last scene, the now-infamous nude modeling romp, doesn't cut the boredom or blot out the odious stench of pretension. I'm with the English--subtlety is the key to effective humor, including satire (I assume this piece was intended be a satire--of something!)

I suppose after the fifth or sixth time with someone stepping on dog doo I laughed. But that doesn't help over come the fact that I sat thru the whole movie waiting for something of substance to happen.None of the characters had much to contribute, and you could really care less for any of them the way the film gives you snippets of information then jumps randomly to another.  I like Kim Basinger, but I really could do without her faked southern accent in this movie.  It was dumb, as was the rest of the film.The box art suckered me into watching this movie.  I suppose if I watched it again, I might like it more, but I don't want to take the chance on wasting another two hours of my life.

So I guess Altman got that bit right. This is exactly how I'd expect this industry to be like; full of superficial and pompous people who contribute nothing useful to the world (a bit like most studio execs), not even decent clothes by the looks of it! Summed up by the final show that's so ridiculous, it demonstrates how it has all gone too far. Also, where celebrity status is everything, hence the big deal about showing Cher, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Harry Bellafonte etc.Alas, Kim Basinger is fooling nobody with that accent, the scenes with Tim Robbins and Julia Roberts were completely useless, there was no need for them. A waste of talent in all areas as well with too many silly storylines for 2 hours worth of film. "},{"Title":"What? (Ready to Wear)","Date":"20 February 2007","Score":"2 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" It's hard to say anything about this movie. The guy played by Stephen Rea was a silly taking pictures of all of the woman who wanted him. He needs to go somewhere. They got him back. Ready to Wear was an interesting satire. It shows how crazy and ridiculous it is in the industry. The women were beautiful. Kim Basinger, Sophia Loren,Julia Roberts, Tracy Ullman were all characterized in different ways. Each had their own personalities. Ms. Roberts and Tim Robbins in the bed all day was funny. They just loved steaming up the room. That was something to see right there. There have been few films like Ready to Wear that shed so much light on one industry. The ending was crazy. The models coming out nude(naked) was some serious mess. No way would I put that on the runway. That is the down part.

Makers of this film dismiss bad reviews of the movie as coming from people who just don't get it... their opinion of the general public is evident by their dumbing down of the title for American audiences (changing Pret-A-Porter to its English equivalent, Ready-To-Wear).  Really, there is nothing to get.  The only thing I can say about the plot is that it somewhat exists, although it is boring and muddled.  When I saw this movie at the theater, half of the audience walked out.  As I left, those who stayed for the whole thing left confused (and wondering why they didn't hop to the adjacent movie, I'm sure).I'm sure the makers of this film think it is art, but much like most things in fashion, real people have no interest in this sort of art. Everything centers around the fashion world in this movie, so if that's not your cup of tea, avoid this film.  I gave it 2 out of 10.

The so-called humour was absent without leave, not even close to raising a single laugh in the audience. The same old 'joke' ran through the movie with some guy treading in dog crap in every scene, and that was as funny as it got...There was no plot. You felt no empathy, or even interest, in the shallow, stereotyped characters. It really was cringe worthy. I couldn't believe what I was watching. I recall that this was supposed to be some kind of parody of the fashion industry and perhaps there are lots of in-jokes I have no hope of spotting, or maybe my English sense of humour is too evolved for the obvious, puerile humour.

The Cast was nearly perfect. Robert Altman had an other great subject to make a film = the fashion world. He did it in 'The Player for the movie world, Nashvill for the music world... ! But It is important to see this film only as a farce and not as a classic one. It is only a kind of experiment. It is maybe niece to see the prestation of some actors in my opinion.-Marcello Mastroianni; He plays a russian man how is attracted to Sophia Loren.-Sophia Loren; Plays the wife of Jean-Pierre Cassell how died in the film.-Lauren Bacall; She is one of the reporters from fashion books like Vogue, Harper Bazaar (in which she appeared 50 years ago). Sadly her role is too small.-Jean Rochefort plays the dective when Jean-Pierre Cassell died.-Julia Roberts plays Ann Eisenhower but you don't see her a lot in the film, she lives together with Tim Robbins in room of the hotel.--But they all tried to make a good movie.*It isn't one story, but you get a ten storys in one movie.--- I like the locations in Paris, but when you see the dog mess you really see what Altman thinks about the fashion world.Rating 7,5/10 "},{"Title":"zzzzz  One of the most boring films ever!  zzzzz","Date":"4 September 2007","Score":"2 out of 9 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" This film should be prescribed by doctors as a cure for insomniacs!
