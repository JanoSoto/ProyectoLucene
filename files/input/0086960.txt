[{"Title":"Axel Foley Eddie Murphy's best role","Date":"5 June 2005","Score":"66 out of 73 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Beverly Hills Cop was a big hit in the 1980's. The film was loved by many action fans, as well as comedy fans and movie buffs at the time. It is still being admired by many people as one of the funniest cop movies ever made.The thing I love about this movie is that Eddie Murphy was perfectly cast as the Axel Foley character. Originally, Sylvester Stallone was considered for the role. Thank God he wasn't! Eddie Murphy was perfect for the role, because he can be a clever cop, and can at the same time be very funny! Another great thing about Beverly Hills Cop is its smashing soundtrack. There are some great hit songs from the 1980's featured in the soundtrack, as well as an excellent musical score which can be heard throughout the movie (to me, the musical score is the Beverly Hills Cop theme song).Perhaps the only downside of Beverly Hills Cop is that it can be pretty slow in certain scenes. Hardcore action fans would probably be disappointed by this. But let's face it Beverly Hills Cop is not an all-out mindless action movie. It is actually a clever comedy with elements of action present within.To conclude, Beverly Hills Cop is arguably Eddie Murphy's best film since he fits the Axel Foley character perfectly. There are many funny scenes featuring Eddie Murphy that will have people laughing (even the action scenes can be cleverly funny)! P.S Look out for cameos by Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot, and Damon Wayans!

The film is an unconventional detective story that has Murphy, a Detroit police officer, go to Beverly Hills after his close friend is killed. Murphy wants to find out who killed his friend and why. What he discovers is one of the largest illegal drug fronts around in an art museum. Now it is up to Murphy to bring down the bad guys and save the day. Beverly Hills Cop is a film that showed the greatness of the 1980s. A pop-culture, box office hit that was funny and full of action and sported a smashing soundtrack.

Axel assumes the suspect is a local tycoon, but no one seems to believe him &#150; including the police force, being semi-run by Ronny Cox (in one of his rare good-guy roles).Axel comes into trouble with the law his first day on the job after getting thrown through a glass window by some thugs. He is arrested, and when released finds himself hounded by a pair of inept police officers around the town for a few days. After outsmarting them (in one of cinema's most delightful moments &#150; ever) Axel gets hooked up with an old friend and manages to roam the streets looking for clues &#150; which, of course, he finds very easily.Before this film Eddie Murphy had starred in one film that had launched his name into Hollywood 48 HRS. But by all reasonable comparisons this is a much, much better film, and it's also much, much funnier, too. What's most refreshing is that it doesn't fall back upon the stereotypes of African-Americans inherent in so many mainstream motion pictures &#150; the role of Axel Foley was originally written for Sylvester Stallone (who was actually attached to star early on in pre-production before dropping out of the project) and it's quite clear that Foley was intended as a white character. Although massive rewrites were employed only two weeks before shooting, script flaws can still be spotted &#150; the heroine of the story is a white businesswoman, for example, and we expect some sort of sexual tension between them but there is none. We begin to question the very presence of the female lead because in essence it leads nowhere. We can imagine how it might have developed into a love story, but Murphy works against the flow, awkwardly treating her as nothing more than a friend.These sorts of things sometimes bring out the occasional odd touches in the film &#150; ironically they unintentionally set the film apart from other such movies of the genre because it's not typical in any sense. Sure, it has the routine shoot-outs but there is no romance subplot, no pointless racial comparisons (more of which would be seen in the two sequels), etc. The movie greatly benefits from this because it seems so fresh, and far more believable &#150; after all, rarely are romances developed in two days. The action genre always seems to end with the hero sending off the crooks to jail, and finally getting a long-awaited kiss from the leading lady. Beverly Hills Cop, to its credit, manages to avoid this and the result is a far more enjoyable film, even if most of its sequences are far from being 100% realistic.The film's director, Martin Brest, has a clear handle on the buddy genre and would go on to direct the immensely successful Robert De Niro / Charles Grodin road-buddies-comedy Midnight Run, one of the most popular (and best) of the genre. Beverly Hills Cop works just as well &#150; it's funny when it needs to be, thrilling when it wants to be, and features a stellar lead performance by Murphy in his most unusual role.Murphy is the driving force behind the film, presenting us with a truly likable character &#150; the most likable character he's ever played, as a matter of fact. Axel is unorthodox but a generally good guy &#150; Murphy is sometimes typecast into playing roles similar to that of which he played in 48 HRS. (being the loud, obnoxious racist who's got it all together), but here he plays someone we actually want to root for. At one point in the film he manages to get a couple of police officers in trouble with their superior &#150; but he takes all the blame, and actually fabricates a lie wherein they were heroes doing their job, despite the fact that they were all actually hanging out at a strip club. Axel is tough, cool, quick-witted, nice, sarcastic, and likable &#150; one of cinema's most enduring characters, and proof that African-American cinema heroes don't always have to be loudmouths in order to succeed as characters (pay attention, Chris Rock and Chris Tucker).The now-famous soundtrack (including 'Axel F' by Harold Faltermeyer) is a great blend of techno-pop and electronic rock &#150; the movie's theme is bouncy, rambunctious and fun a good parallel to Axel himself.Overall Beverly Hills Cop exceeds exceptionally well, even if a great deal of the film's success itself derives from pure accident and chance. I don't think anyone can say that those involved in the production knew exactly what they were doing at the time (DVD supplements include anecdotes about hectic filming and the project almost falling through at one point) -- but as luck would have it everything turned out fine. Beverly Hills Cop is an immensely enjoyable film, and one of the best examples of the cop-comedy genre executed properly.

It was one of those movies that my dad would let my brother and I watch on weekends, after my mom made him promise not to show us any rated R movies, and over the years it's easy to forget the level of violence and profanity in it that earned it that forbidding rating. Of course, as a kid I was just excited that I was getting to see something that I shouldn't, but in retrospect I tend to think that it was this combination of clever comedy and the ingredients from harder action thrillers that ensured Beverly Hills Cop's status as a cop comedy classic. You see, Foley has a bit of a criminal past of his own, but he is clearly much more at home on the right side of the law, and he uses his experiences in crime to his advantage in working his way into the criminal underworld, where he routinely attempts to bring down major crime ring kingpins. One day an old friend comes to visit him after having been released from prison and spending some time relaxing in the California sun. The two have a great time at the bar recounting their old criminal days together, until we learn that this guy, who once took the fall for one of Axel's crimes and served prison time for him without ever mentioning his name, now has stolen bearer bonds with him worth millions. Before long the owner of the bonds shows up and is not in a reminiscent mood. Axel is knocked out as they're staggering back to his apartment for the night, and he wakes up to find his friend murdered.The movie follows one of the biggest 1980s action movie clich√©s to the letter. Every single line is here, 'take some time off,' 'stay away from this case,' 'if you go after this guy don't bother calling in on Monday,' etc. My eyes tend to glaze over whenever I hear this situation in a movie, probably because I work so much and in such situations can only think of how great it would be if my bosses told me to take some time off, go on vacation, don't let them catch me working or they'll fire me. But Foley's trip to Beverly Hills to perform his own investigation yields results so promising that it keeps the movie moving along at a pretty fast pace. Of course we realize the real life odds of a police officer traveling to the other side of the country and immediately stumbling across the major crime organization that he's looking for, but Murphy's quick-talking wit and street-wise charm makes it pretty easy to root for him. The movie has the perfect premise to combine with Murphy's personality &#x96; he's an urban cop from Detroit named Axel Foley who is always driving his boss insane because he doesn't wait for piddly things like authorization when he wants to do major undercover work. The movie opens with one of these undercover and under the radar missions, which culminates in the police being called and then a major car chase through city and residential streets that must have caused millions of dollars in damage. Of course, when the cops have Axel at gunpoint, he gives them a grin and they shake their heads and lower their guns. Aw shucks, it's that crazy Foley again!Judge Reinhold and John Ashton play Detectives Rosewood and Taggart, two of Beverly Hillss finest who are assigned to keep an eye on Foley and make sure he doesn't start doing police work while a dozen states or so outside his jurisdiction, from which he's suspended anyway. So Foley moves around among the Ferraris and BMWs and Mercedeses of Beverly Hills in his ancient, beat up Chevy Nova, cheerfully laughing at Taggart's and Rosewood's bumbling efforts to tail him and doing his investigation right under their noses. In the standard buddy cop movie sitcom, you have two wildly different people thrown together in a police partnership situation and forced to work together. This was a staple of the 1980s and has remained popular to this day, with classic movies like Lethal Weapon, Tango & Cash, 48 hours (one of Murphy's own earlier comedies), Red Heat, Rush Hour (could two cops ever be more different than Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan?), and possibly my favorite, Hot Fuzz. And of course I shouldn't forget Bad Boys, which may very well have so much in common with Beverly Hills Cop as to warrant suspicion of plagiarism. I'll let it go though. I'm sure Eddie Murphy doesn't mind. Anyway, Beverly Hills Cop does follow all of the basic rules of your standard buddy cop movie, but somehow manages to avoid feeling like a formula film. The combination of Axel's determination to avenge his friend's murder is juxtaposed with hilarious situations involving Taggart and Rosewood trying in vain to keep an eye on him, as well as various police organizations tearing their hair out trying to keep him under control. Picture the police chief in Last Action Hero, a bad movie for which I maintain a certain affection, and make him intelligible and add a lot of profanity and you'll get some idea of what's going on here. I don't know that Beverly Hills Cop can quite be called a comedy classic, but it is definitely an action comedy classic.Also keep your eye out for the hilarious cameo from Bronson Pinchot, who you may remember as Balki from Perfect Strangers! Eleventh best TV show ever!

This film is a funny, fast paced, action filled fun ride and Murphy really made the film an enjoyable experience.  Thank God that Sylvester Stallone backed out because I feel the film would have been a very dark intense film.  At least Murphy made Axel into a smart aleck who helped to lighten the mood of the film.  Also, the one underrated performance has to have been Judge Reinhold.

They are finely crafted, energetic, and extraordinarily human.  The warmth and friendship shine through, even through the gun- and fist-play which are obligatory in a cops-and-robbers movie.  This is one of the first and best prototypes of the buddy movie. Brest's casting is superb, and he elicits performances which are often the best of even young actors' careers.  Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and Ronnie Cox are outstanding, and the ensemble clicks like a well-oiled infield. To me, this movie is still far and away Eddie Murphy's best performance.  He is remarkably talented, a comic genius.  As an actor, his expressions are sometimes outlandish, but always completely in character, and appropriate to the dramatic situation.  Villain Victor Maitland (played by Steven Berkoff, the husband of Alberta Watson, Madeline in La Femme Nikita) is chillingly underplayed; the cold-blooded evil shines through the civilized facade.BHC is one of the few movies which I can watch with my loved ones again and again and never tire.  Even as a comedy, it has a solidness and integrity which make it extremely durable. I look forward eagerly to Martin Brest's next film.  Meanwhile, I always have Beverly Hills Cop.

This was in the days when Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer were getting started in their modern appeal to the dollar.  It also proves to be the best.  Audio is skimped on, as it always is in their movies, but the highlight is the fact that Martin Brest--previously fired off of WarGames--doesn't let Bruckheimer get in the way of the story.Had a less competent director, say Tony Scott or Michael Bay, been put in charge, the movie would have fallen apart like BHC II did.  Fortunately, Brest knows how far to push things and when to back off.  He is helped by Arthur Coburn and Billy Weber, two of the best editors short of Michael Kahn.  It's too bad that Arthur lost precedence in Hollywood and Billy wound up a slave to Bruckheimer.The charge in this movie is still strong after nearly 20 years, but there are obvious signs of aging.  Thankfully, the dialogue is not Bruckheimer's typical macho-BS, but rather natural and fluid.  Eddie delivers again and again.  The remainder of the cast, obscure as they are fair, but it is John Ashton who has the least trouble with his lines.The only major fault I find with BHC is not in the film itself, but rather in how many times the formula has been duplicated, mimicked, plagarized, and copied.  Each time less inventive or original than the rest.Overall, funny and somewhat vulgar (this is not for fans of Dr. Doolittle or The Nutty Professor), but it shows when Eddie was at his pinnacle of ability...before the inferior screenwriters took over.  A gem of the 80s.  3.5 out of 5 stars.

Upon getting there he falls foul of everyone he meets with his tough Detroit approach work. Undaunted, Foley, aided by old friend, Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher) and two intrigued local detectives, starts to unravel the mystery.There was a time when Eddie Murphy ruled the world. After Trading Places had introduced us to his sharp comedic tongue, and 48 Hours had shown him to be a more than capable action character actor, Beverly Hills Cop fused the two and propelled Murphy to super-stardom. Directed by Martin Brest and produced by Messers Simpson & Bruckheimer, it's really no surprise that Hills Cop is shallow, simple (fish out of water comedy standard) and utterly commercial. Yet with its gusto, humorous script (Daniel Petrie Jr) and neat plotting, it becomes a hugely entertaining film. One led superbly by Murphy with his comedy fuelled energy and knack for timing.Hard to believe that the likes of Sly Stallone and Al Pacino were first mooted for the role, not as a comedy one imagines, but as it being a standard police action movie. But enter Murphy and it ended up a fine blend of action and comedy. There's little digs at Beverly Hills and its smugness, a way of life that Foley, with his down on the streets toughness, can't comprehend. While opposing police methods also get a wry once over; wonderfully threaded by the relationship between Foley, Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Steven Berkoff's by the numbers villain is something of a let down and Ronny Cox is sadly playing filler time with an underwritten character. But this is about Murphy, the fabulous stunt work and the successful union of action and comedy. And hey! Even Harold Faltermeyer's bobbing synth score, Axel F, has a nippiness that remains quintessentially 1980s. 8/10 "},{"Title":"The movie that launched Eddie into Superstardom.","Date":"7 March 2004","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":"  I've Seen this movie over Twenty times and i know the scenes word for word.It showed that comedians could be thrown in serious roles,instead of just playing a clown or fool.It was good from start to finish.

Now not having seen it before, I found this edited for tv version hilarious. A few years later, I finally had my chance to watch it in all its profanity strewn glory. The moment where Foley's (Murphy) boss first walks into the the locker room, and launches into a tirade of F words, is just incredibly funny, especially if like me you believe that a proper comedy should contain swearing. As far as the story stands, Murphy is Axel Foley, the motormouthed detective with attitude. When an old friend of his is killed, he goes in search of the perpetrators. The case leads him to Beverly Hills, where he eventually teams up with two local cops (John Ashton playing grumpy and Judge Reinhold his younger, more easily influenced partner), and we move from great scene to great scene (a banana in the tail pipe, and a strip bar to name two). Murphy is electric in the role that made him the biggest star of the period, his street talk is funny and very profane. Ashton and Reinhold give able support, as the often bickering detective duo, and Steven Berkoff is suitably menacing as the villain. There is also a stomach achingly funny cameo from Bronson Pinchot as a camp art gallery employee, and his scene with Murphy lives long in the memory. In fact, many of the best comic moments are the sort you suddenly think of on the bus/train, and cause you to laugh out loud in public. To this day it stands as the highest grossing R rated film in America, and it lasted 13 weeks at the number 1 spot, a record recently broken by Titanic.

His wisecracks was totally uninhibited and it shows.Since then there has been some good and very bad Murphy movies but when this first came out, his humour was enormously fresh. His sheep-like laugh was the clincher and has since been imitated, but never duplicated.The plot is not much to speak off and you could only wonder what a disaster it could have been if Sylvester Stallone had been cast, as was originally intended. The idea of a black man rubbing the very white people in Beverly Hills the wrong way is of course brilliantly thought out and I can't think of other actors who could portray the white cops better than the people chosen here.The one thing I will always remember about this was of course the theme song by Harold Faltermayer. It had some kind of inexplicably hold on you that you nearly whistled the tune out loud every time you heard it.

There he hooks up with another old friend, Jenny, and makes an uneasy alliance with local cop Judge Reinhold while the other cops (John Ashton, Ronny Cox) take to an immediate dislike to Murphy.This is a great showcase for Murphy fast talking antics and trademark laugh as he stays one step ahead of the cops and villains alike and generally spouts all kinds of nonsense that you can't help laughing at.

That it is successful proves there is a God. -Martin Brest on his own movie.It's easy to understand his feelings when you consider the endless changes made to Danilo Bach and Daniel Petrie Jr's script. They got an Academy Award nomination, but the final product is a million miles away from what they originally conceived.Axel Foley was originally written for Mickey Rourke, then it was geared around Sylvester Stallone, who significantly rewrote the script further before abandoning the project a couple of weeks before shooting was scheduled to begin. Eddie Murphy was brought on board at the last minute, and the script was re-written yet again to form the movie we know today. Bizarrely, all of the work Stallone did on the script was recycled into his reprehensible 1986 action movie Cobra, which, on top of being nothing at all like Beverly Hills Cop, called itself an adaptation of a novel called Fair Game by Paula Gosling (which it also bore little-to-no resemblance to). Nine years later, that novel was once again made into a movie of the same name starring William Baldwin and Cindy Crawford, which bore no resemblance to Cobra. When I say that Beverly Hills Cop had the biggest hodgepodge of a shooting script ever, you better believe it.The story could not get any simpler. Young renegade Detroit cop Axel Foley, forever tormenting his no-nonsense boss with his reckless antics, meets up with a childhood pal only for him to be murdered that very night. Axel follows the trail and travels to Beverly Hills in his crappy, banged-up sky-blue Chevy Nova. It's a world away from the streets of Detroit. Even the patrol cops look like soap opera actors. Axel's fast and loose work ethic, barely on the good side of the law, doesn't sit well with the Beverly Hills police department. Detectives Taggart and Rosewood (John Ashton and Judge Reinhold doing a Laurel and Hardy routine) are assigned to keep an eye on Axel as he very quickly discovers the bad guy.No twists, no surprises, and barely a couple layers deep, it's amazing that a story so superficial is able get 105 minutes of mileage. The film works thanks to Murphy's cheerful, upbeat performance and Martin Brest's ability to keep it light. Beverly Hills Cop would not have worked as a dark thriller. Harold Faltermeyer's iconic score and world-famous Axel F theme tune certainly help the happy-go-lucky nature.There are certainly shortcomings. Steven Berkoff, as Victor Maitland, is completely unconvincing as the villain. In fact, with the exception of Bennett from Commando, he's probably the least threatening/most campiest villain I've ever seen in a movie. And, as I have mentioned, the story is very straightforward. Taggart and Rosewood do virtually no police work and are just bystanders watching and reacting to Axel's hustles. Apart from one cruise along Rodeo Drive, we never really see or feel the glamor of Beverly Hills to juxtapose it next to the grime of Detroit. There are just too many interior scenes.But it never fails to entertain and is truly the highlight of Murphy's career. Once, long before he sold out to family audiences, his R-rated movies were huge business, and Beverly Hills Cop showcases his leading man ability at its very best.

The film is well cast all the way down to the smallest roles and Eddie is in top form, but not enough credit has been given to the excellent screenplay.

What they actually did was take a classic fish out of water premise (Eddie in Beverly Hills!) and spin a wonderful variaion on it with rich, lovable characters and creative use of language. The salty language in this movie is used in a way that stings more than actual violence does. Could Inspector Todd be any more menacing if he actually had a weapon in his hands? No. His mouth is the weapon. Every character in this movie, all the way down to the Bronson Pinchot character, has a unigue way with words. It's the screenplay, not just the energtic acting, that will alow this movie to stand the test of time.

The only Pearson in the film that usurps Murphy is one Bronson Pinchot, and that's only because his part is very short, but memorable for all the right reasons.It's a wonderful, bright, sunny movie that epitomises the eighties, and even the synth soundtrack and hilarious outfits, can't age this movie.Because laughter is timeless......

Mikey had recently returned from Los Angeles and had been tracked down and killed by his former employer for theft of smuggled bonds.After the murder Axel heads to Los Angeles to seek more information about Mikey's past and who could have ordered the killing. The film's theme revolved around Axel taking whatever steps necessary to solve the crime, whether those methods were legal or illegal. He begins his search for answers by first visiting another childhood friend Jenny Summers (Lisa Eilbacher) and she informs him that her employer Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff) hired Mikey as a favor to her.Thus begins Axel's fact finding about what type of business man Victor really is. During his search for answers he is in constant conflict with the Beverly Hills Police Department over his choice of tactics in the search for the truth about Victor. He is constantly reprimanded by Lt. Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox) and tailed by Detectives John Taggart and Billy Rosewood (John Ashton and Judge Reinhold).Once Axel uncovers the truth about Victor he convinces Detective Rosewood to take him to Victor's warehouse where he believes a drug shipment is located. He entered with his friend Jenny and while she is kidnapped, Axel with Billy's help is able to escape and team up with Taggart and Rosewood to rescue Jenny and avenge his friend's death by killing Victor Maitland.The film used different aspects to portray Axel in many different scenes. To establish Axel as a tough street wise cop from Detroit the mood was gray and a montage was used in the beginning of the film to show a depressed city and a struggling population. Once Axel arrived in Beverly Hills a sunny, bright montage was presented displaying economic well-being and an environment that Axel would have to adjust to in solving the crime.The use of close ups throughout the film were very effective in both a comedic sense and to display character emotions. They were used extensively by the filmmaker to establish points at the end of different scenes.Axel's do whatever it takes mentality was extremely effective throughout the film. The film flowed well and Axel's common sense crime solving, much like Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) was effective and kept viewers on the edge of their seat, always wondering what was next. It was refreshing to see Axel solve the crime from the comedic and common sense view rather than Dirty harry just bullying or eliminating everything he needed to in order to solve the crime.

Alex Foley), Judge Reinhold (Det. Billy Rosewood), and Gilbert R. Hill (Insp. Douglas Todd). This action based film follows Detroit detective Axel Foley on his mission across the country in California to find out who murdered his old friend Mikey Tandino (James Russo). After Mikey is murdered Axel is left with only a few clues but with his quick wit and cheap tricks he quickly finds himself picking up the scent of some corrupt characters that could have something to do with his investigation. With a strong theme of revenge this film does a great job of blending comedy and action together making it an instant classic.Axel is explicitly told not pursue his investigation of Mikey's murder by his chief inspector back in Detroit. With the threat of the truth about his actions in Beverly Hills getting back to his Detroit chief the local Lt. Andrew Bogomil (Ronny Cox), plagues Axel with constant surveillance by his own detectives. Just like other buddy cop movies like Lethal Weapon and 48 hours this movie takes three extremely different characters and forces them to join forces to catch the criminals. Axel's outrageous stunts and unorthodox way of scouting out information clash with the strictly by the book ways of local detectives Billy Rosewood and Det. Sgt. John Taggart (John Ashton). Of course, it's not all roses and unicorns for this dynamic trio in the beginning. Rosewood and Taggart are deceived by Axel's devious ways and comedic antics while attempting to follow their orders. Eventually they too take the streetwise ways of Axel after the trail of clues leads them the ultimate truth that Victor Maitland, a supposed upstanding business man, is actually a corrupt crime boss. With the reoccurring motif of good versus evil represented by differences between Victor's lifestyle and that of the most of the police detectives in the film. The good guys are the hardworking Americans that are struggling with their finances while the corrupt evil Victor Maitland lives luxuriously off of his illegal activities. The tension between good and evil is exaggerated by the camera angles the cinematographer chooses when the main characters are engaged in heated and most of the time ambiguous conversations. In the end the relentless detective Axel gets his revenge for the murder of his friend Mikey in the form of the apprehension of Victor Maitland and his despicable henchmen. With a soundtrack that keeps the action going and the comedy relief of Eddie Murphy's constant antics this film is and will remain to be one of the all-time best cop genre revenge movies.

Murphy is wonderful as the wisecracking Detective Axel Foley, a Detroit police officer who goes to Beverly Hills to solve the murder of his friend, Mikey Tandino (James Russo).

Unlike a lot of people, I also like director Martin Brest's later films 'Meet Joe Black' and 'Gigli'. I think they were both unnecessarily reviled. Sure, 'Joe Black' is really long, but it is also very rewarding.'Beverly Hills Cop' is just one of those films where everything slots neatly into place. It was an early hit for the incredibly successful producer team of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and the soundtrack is pure platinum, featuring such artists as Glenn Frey and The Pointer Sisters.

I know we seen this plot so many times before but not in the 80's. Most people nowadays complains about the clich√©s in this movie. I think they should just watch the movie as if it's 1984.This is about Detroit cop Axel Foley who heads to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his best friend. He finds out that an evil tycoon is behind this but no one including the police believe Axel.This movie came out in Eddie Murphy's heyday. He was a fine actor in the 80's. It's only when the 2000's came when he made bad movie after bad movie(except Shrek). Judge Reinhold really adds comedy to the cops with his portrayal.Another thing that stands out is the music. Of course, everybody knows about the song, Axel F. This is one of the best soundtracks in modern movie history.Overall this is a great comedy/action movie. I kind of wish that I was able to see these 80's movies in theaters. I rate this film 9/10. "},{"Title":"Disturbing the peace?

Basically Det. Axel Foley (Golden Globe nominated Murphy) is the young, talkative and wise-cracking Detroit cop, who while reckless in his crime solving has become talented since reforming from his hoodlum days. He delighted to see his childhood friend Mikey Tandino (James Russo), saying he is working in Beverly Hills as a security guard with Axel's mutual friend Jeannette 'Jenny' Summers (Lisa Eilbacher). Then Mikey is murdered right in front of Axel by a man named Zack (Jonathan Banks), and he is compelled to investigate the murder. Axel pretends to go on vacation in Beverly Hills to his boss Inspector Douglas Todd (Gil Hill), but there Lt. Andrew Bogomil (Total Recall's Ronny Cox) assigns Det. William 'Billy' Rosewood (Ruthless People's Judge Reinhold) and Det. Sgt. John Taggart (John Ashton) to keep an eye on him. With the help of Jenny, Axel meets her boss, and Mikey's one-time boss also, art gallery owner Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff), who doubles as a drug kingpin, using the gallery as a cover-up. After confirming all the suspicions, Axel, with the co-operation of Bogomil, and the help of Rosewood and Taggart, they all go to bring Maitland to justice. Also starring Stephen Elliott as Police Chief Hubbard, Gilbert R. Hill as Insp. Douglas Todd, Art Kimbro as Det. Foster, Joel Bailey as Det. McCabe and Bronson Pinchot as Serge. You have to remind yourself sometimes that Murphy was a huge star famed for his foul mouth before going into the family films genre, but that is one of the big hooks, my favourite lines are his Get the f*** out of here! to the foreign and camp art guy. Anyway, Murphy really throws himself into this fun role that could have gone to Sylvester Stallone, he has a great swagger attitude to the character, and the supporting cast add to the fun as well. I have to admit also that the Axel F theme tune by Harold Faltermeyer is great, but sometimes I can't help but think of the Crazy Frog (which I do like). I was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Score for Harold Faltermeyer, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Eddie Murphy was number 67 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Axel F was number 28 on 50 Greatest One Hit Wonders, and the film was number 63 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 44 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!

A big part of why I love this movie is because I grew up on it. I loved Eddie Murphy as a kid. Whether he's a brilliant actor or not, or whether or not the majority of his movies are very good, he has an energy completely apart from a movie itself. He's simply Eddie, in the face of whatever his characters' adversities are. But this isn't the reason I still love this movie as an adult. Watching now, I'm seeing a sharply written fish-out-of-water story---a clever insight into how a character behaves out of his element---masquerading as a Hollywood blockbuster star vehicle.It opens with a way-over-the-top chase between a huge semi-truck and various Keystone-like squadcars, which would be exciting if it didn't function primarily as a Pointer Sisters music video. Neutron Dance is the foreground of this set-piece, not the imagery it's scoring. We're dancing in our seats instead of gripping them. Still, the film's beginning is also drenching us in the utter grittiness of urban Detroit. While also essentially a music video for The Heat is On, the opening credits sequence is comprised of naturalistic, documentary street scenes of real people, housing developments, smokestacks, etc. At the same time the film-making is glitzy and commercial with its soundtrack and obligatory set-pieces, it's truly impressive how it absorbs us in one environment and then, by the end, has completely entrenched us in another one worlds apart.We meet Axel in action, in character undercover, wearing a smart-ass shell when he shows his face at the station after such a disaster, following in the tradition of reckless cops winning scorn from their superiors, in this case a scene-stealing performance by Gil Hill as his no-nonsense boss Inspector Todd. We then see Axel take in a surprise visit from his childhood friend Mikey, who's broken into his apartment, raided his fridge, proceeding to show him some suspicious bearer bonds. Axel doesn't care, doesn't want to know, just happy to see his old pal. We learn that Axel wasn't always into serving and protecting, and although Mikey now has a job as a security guard out in Beverly Hills, Mikey still isn't. This is the reason the night doesn't end so well for Mikey, as well as why Axel finds himself conning his way through Beverly Hills, ostensibly on vacation but really working as an effective cop with the instincts of a street-smart criminal.This is very funny, because essentially the movie's premise is composed of a foul-mouthed inner-city cop showing clean-cut, by-the-book veterans how to catch a killer. We know who had Mikey snuffed as soon as we're introduced to him, which is correct, because what the movie's all about is how the strict bureaucracy and elite judicial system protect the biggest criminals. The culprit here is Victor Maitland, a sophisticated millionaire, one of the most respected art dealers in the country. He's also involved in a complex smuggling operation and ordering hits on little people who take more than they earn just as he does, like Mikey, and gets away with it because Beverly Hills' finest, the customs house, his manufacturers, all do just what they're told, nothing more. The more time we spend with Axel in Beverly Hills, the more we realize the cultural inducements that allow Maitland the luxury of being above even ballpark suspicion. Whenever/however Axel follows his detective instincts to Maitland, he's breaking rules, charged with felonies, in positions where he must fool everybody, until finally the Beverly Hills police are so jarred from their robotic procedure, and of course inclined to think like detectives, that reason takes over Why would this exotic cop, this foul-mouthed jerk from outta town be so persistent at all this if he didn't have reason to believe something's really up?Indeed, the movie doesn't paint Axel's unlikely cohorts as mean, ignorant, snobbish. We love these guys. In their own contrasting way, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold as Taggart and Rosewood are equally funny, perhaps even more so in some scenes, as Murphy is as Foley. And they're better than he is at adopting the gravity of less comical scenes, which makes their Laurel and Hardy relationship more complex and inspired. At any rate, these three are responsible for improvising much of their dialogue, even creating whole scenes, like the supercop bit, the red-meat-in-the-bowels, bringing an inimitable chemistry to their trio. While Ronny Cox is awesome in sinister roles like in RoboCop, he plays Lieutenant Bogomil not as an uptight jerk of a superior, just firm about enforcing regulations; he's got a boss too, and hangs his head and sucks up in his presence like Taggart and Rosewood do in his.And as I said, it's great on a pure entertainment level. There are actually lots of great bit performances. There's Bronson Pinchot's memorable Serge, an effeminate European art salesman, basically the first person Axel meets in Beverly Hills. Murphy's subdued reaction to Pinchot is correct. A Martin Lawrence or Chris Tucker would've probably submerged the scene in some bombastic repulsion, but Murphy's persona in its heyday was much more graceful and well-timed than that. There's also the great veteran character actor Jonathan Banks as Maitland's thug, so matter-of-fact and stone-cold, especially when he pulls the trigger on Mikey. Oh, and Paul Reiser as the fly buzzing around Axel early on at the Detroit precinct. And the soundtrack, including obviously the immortal Faltermeyer synth melody, does give the movie an upbeat energy, though I do have my complaints. It's a real movie about the underdog in the rich man's world, and a ceaselessly entertaining one.

Anybody planning to rent it, however, may find himself feeling a little shocked on occasion if he has expected to recline on his sofa and take in an amusing story about a cocky, streetwise cop who upstages several naive ones.Beverly Hills Cop also includes a few plainly violent scenes, each one sobering because its realism. A viewer sensitive to gunfire or fisticuffs might find these moments upsetting, notwithstanding Axel Foley's gestures or comments to make light of their intensity. For those having an easier time assimilating the violence, though, Beverly Hills Cop not only entertains, with mostly clever and some crude dialog, it also informs. Featuring a plot that involves cocaine and coffee grounds, customs and contraband, responsible and reproachful police protocol, Beverly Hills Cop gives its audience a valuable introductory course in law enforcement and criminology.Beverly Hills Cop has remained popular, I believe, because of the performances -- all of them -- from those of the thugs with the small parts to the leads. To me, two actors stand out, nevertheless Ronnie Cox, the ethical Beverly Hills Police Lieutenant Andrew Bogomil, who handles his force with the controlled anger of a school principal, and Gilbert Hill, the Detroit Police Inspector Todd, not at all formal but equally intolerant of Axel Foley's nonconforming ways.

You got Eddie Murphy as the fish-out-of-water Detroit cop Axel Foley, supported by veterans Ronny Cox (Andrew Bogemill) and John Ashton (Sgt. Taggart). Throw in a fresh-out-of-Ridgemont high Judge Reinhold (Lt. Rosewood), and we have an action/comedy/buddy movie for the ages.Although most of the film centers on the chemistry between Foley, Rosewood and Taggart, the true buddies of the film are Foley and Bogemill. The Beverly Hills police chief knows something is wrong in his town when Foley shows up from Detroit investigating a murder from there, and seems to immediately sense that this street-smart inner-city cop who only recently crossed over from the wrong side of the tracks wouldn't be there without a good reason. Unfortunately, Foley does not blend in Beverly Hills, and Bogemill is hobbled by Police Chief Hubbard (Stephen Ellion). Paul Reiser had yet to emerge from the background at the time of this film, playing Jeffrey Mario Andretti Friedman (as he'd be called in the sequel), while Bronson Pinochet had his coming-out party as art-gallery flameball Serge.The film's conflict centers primarily not around Foley, but Bogemill, who literally cannot rid Beverly Hills of Foley faster than his suspicions about art gallery owner Victor Maitlin grow. Foley's presence upsets Maitlin, who grows more and more brazen in his attempt to put a lid on the genie of truth that wants to escape.The action moves excellently, and very comedically along the way, leading to a climax which unites Bogemill and Foley against a common enemy, to further underscore how similar the two are in their life's missions, despite the disparity in their approaches. Foley and Bogemill have a fundamental mutual respect for each other's methods, at times with each one wishing they could be more like the other, and knowing that both of them have their place in catching the bad guys. Bogemill is the least surprised in the department as he watches his officers repeatedly outsmarted by Foley, and the first to have faith in Foley's instincts when it becomes clear that Maitlin is not all that he seems.Ronny Cox is not the type of actor who stands out much, except perhaps with his over-the-top performance as Dick Jones in Robocop, but in this film he complements Eddie Murphy perfectly, helping to ensure that his film debut was a spectacular one. Without Murphy, the film wouldn't have been as funny (Stallone was originally set to play the lead), and without any of the other leads, it might have suffered a bit, but without Cox, it might not have worked at all. Every minute he was on screen was crucial to the plot, and any mistakes in his performance would have brought the entire film down. He delivered better here than at any other time in his career before or after.You aren't part of pop culture if you don't see this film at least once, and preferably three or four times. It's always on cable, so it's not difficult to find.

Murphy is able to sustain his gift for levity from beginning to end. This is a must-see for his many fans, if there are any of the younger generation that have not already seen it. But it is also for any lover of exceptional action flicks with humorous dialog and situations. The writers pass the fun around. Fact is Murphy doesn't have the funniest line in the show. That honor goes to John Ashton as Det. Sgt. John Taggart. Detective Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) stands up like a wooden Indian and yells at the thugs shooting at him, Police! You're all under arrest! The thugs answer with a volley of machine gun fire. Taggart looks at Rosewood and tells him deadpan, You do that again, I'll shoot you myself! Also nearly upstaging the brilliant Murphy is Bronson Pinchot as Serge who has to be heard to be believed. His verbal exchange with Murphy at the art gallery is one of the high points of the movie.The writers and director deliver the goods for the multi-talented Murphy by giving him a good story filled with wit and daring and making the film action-packed with nary a dull minute. Det. Axel Foley (Murphy) is one of Detroit's finest but he is at times a loose cannon. He attempts to make an unauthorized drug bust only to haggle with the dealers over money. Not realizing Foley is undercover, uniformed police check out the situation leading to one of the most destructive chases on celluloid. After being chewed out by Insp. Douglas Todd (Gilbert R.

Beverly Hills Cop remains Murphy's sturdiest, funniest vehicle, a rare classic of its genre that even two weak-minded sequels can't cloud over.In Detroit, police detective Axel Foley (Murphy) loses a friend to a hit he believes had something to do with business the friend had in Beverly Hills. Apparently too poor for airfare, Foley drives to California in his beat-up Chevy Nova and pokes around, earning the ire of a sinister art dealer as well as the Beverly Hills police. Shrugging off assorted butt-kickings and improvising like a madman, Foley begins learning art isn't the only thing Victor Maitland is dealing, while winning over two Beverly Hills officers who learn to trust Foley's instincts, and maybe in the process, their own.The film wasn't written initially with Murphy in mind, and there's some awkwardness with that. For example, it's clear from the DVD extras if not the film itself that the lead female character, Maitland's employee and Foley's friend Jenny (beautiful Lisa Eilbacher) was intended to play Foley's love interest when Foley was to be played by Sly Stallone. When Foley turned into a black guy, white Jenny became just a friend.Though it's hard not to think the producers got cold feet because of the interracial love angle, it's easy to forgive because the film is better off without the obligatory romance. Instead, the movie fleshes out the more interesting relationship between Foley and the two Beverly Hills cops, Taggart (John Ashton) and Rosewood (Judge Reinhold). Murphy shines throughout the film, but he's a supernova in the presence of Taggart and Rosewood, both great foils in different, complementary ways. Hardcase Taggart glowers, while the kind and naive Rosewood is won over by Foley's amiable gamesmanship. Even after Foley sticks bananas in his car's tailpipe, a move that costs the two cops a day's pay, Rosewood offers heartfelt thanks for the sandwich Foley sent him as a distraction ploy.Another film would have played Rosewood and Taggart as the uptight white guys trying and failing to crush Foley's groove, but Beverly Hills Cop brings them in and gives you another reason to like Foley beyond his Bugs Bunny antics. We warm to Taggart, for example, even before he warms to Foley because of his stubborn, eyes-open loyalty to his goofy partner Rosewood.So the script has depth, but a shiny surface, too, augmented by many quotable wisecracks, at least in adult company. Most are Foley's lines (Can you put this in a good spot? 'Cause all of this *stuff* happened the last time I parked here. I might as well just call it 'Michael Jackson Can Sit On Top of the World Just As Long As He Doesn't Sit in the Beverly Palm Hotel 'Cause There's No *African Americans* Allowed in There!') but even Maitland gets off a good one in his creepy English voice Careful, old boy, you might hit me.What else is there? Everything! Start with that terrific score, the '80s equivalent of Saturday Night Fever in its front-to-back pop quality. There's standout performances everywhere, by people like Stephen Elliot and Jonathan Banks (a heavy here, though he plays a heroic cop in Murphy's previous action comedy, 48 Hours.) Bronson Pinchot's affectedly exotic art gallery employee makes an indelible impression in just two scenes, critiquing a fellow employee's unbuttoned shirt with the line Vot ees deat? Deat ees not sexy. I even love the sunny sheen of this film, which came to represent everything California was supposed to be when I first saw it back in the day. The Armani suits and coiffed blond hair carry a sense of style every bit as integral to Beverly Hills Cop as dusters and spurs are to Sergio Leone westerns.No, the mystery isn't much of a mystery, and there are flaws. Maitland's guards obviously took their marksman lessons from Darth Vader's stormtroopers, and everything seems to happen too easily for Foley.

There are few people as funny as he is. Not every movie he is in works, but most do - and this one definitely does.The thing about Beverly Hills Cop is that it is hard to specifically call it a drama or a comedy. And, it certainly is not a dramedy. Their are plenty of bad guys that get killed, but when it is Eddie Murphy involved, you just can't take it all that seriously. Every time you look at him, you want to smile. And, of course, the movie had lots of funny moments.The other interesting element to the movie was the fish out of water idea. A black Detroit rule-breaking cop goes to lily white Beverly Hills and intermingles with by-the-book detectives. It almost makes you laugh just thinking about it. It also reminds me of the TV show McCloud where you had a western policeman sent to NY to train. Culture clash movies are usually funny - especially when the fish out of water does a better job than the land people. Of course, Murphy does a better job.You can't go wrong watching this movie.

Smashing box-office records at the end of 1984 and then trouncing all other offerings well into 1985 with the exception of BACK TO THE FUTURE and RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART II, it is as high-concept an entertainment you could wish for.Murphy plays Axel Foley, a Detroit cop quick of mouth, but slow of appreciation for police procedure. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the opening sequence when he works undercover to bust a cigarette smuggling ring in the back of an eighteen wheeler truck which the driver proceeds to use to escape by smashing into anything and everything that happens to be driving at the same time.On arrival back at his precinct, his superior (a real-life Inspector, Gilbert Todd) reprimands him and says that he doesn't know everything. When he goes home, he finds his place broken into and discovers an old friend, Michael Tandino (James Russo), who works in Beverly Hills with a friend, Jenny Summers and shows Foley some bearer bonds. They go out for a drink and a game of pool, but on arrival back at Foley's, Foley is knocked unconscious and Tandino is killed by two hoodlums....Foley is warned by his superior to stay away from the case, but decides to take some vacation time instead, using it as a way to get to Beverly Hills to track down the murderers of his friend......Thanks to Brest's assured direction and some great supporting performances, notably from Ronny Cox, Judge Reinhold & John Ashton as the cops - and Steven Berkoff as Victor Maitland, BEVERLY HILLS COP is a dynamite comedy-thriller that works better than at first glance.A film which you make you want to 'Do the Neutron Dance' for years to come...!!!

After hanging out together,Axel and Michael are ambushed and Michael is murdered. After the murder,Axel takes a vacation and heads to Beverly Hills where Michael used to work and investigate the reasons for Michael's death which lead to hilarious results.Released in 1984,Beverly Hills Cop is an amazing,hilarious and unforgettable classic that became a critical and Box Office success for Eddie Murphy. Prior to Beverly Hills Cop Eddie Murphy was already a star thanks thanks to his funny and memorable supporting work in terrific films such as 48 Hrs and Trading Places,his wonderful four year stint on Saturday Night Live and his stand up television special Delirious but it was Beverly Hills Cop that was Eddie Murphy's first leading role as an actor and was the film that made Murphy not only a mega star but also a movie icon. Right from the first time you watch the film Beverly Hills Cop is an instant classic that will make you laugh out loud and will have tears running down your face. The film is basically a fish out of water tale but is one of the smartest and funniest Comedies of all time that has many scenes and lines that have become apart of pop culture and is one of those films that whenever you see BHC on television or on Home Video you never turn it off. BHC is one of the few films that perfectly mixes Comedy and Action. The laughs and Humor in BHC are hilarious and truly masterful with most of the funny scenes involving the antics of Axel Foley and with moments and dialog that come at a rapid pace that gives BHC a great energy that never slows down until the very end. When you look the Comedic scenes in BHC some of them feel improvised and jokes don't feel forced or fake but flawless. The Action scenes in BHC are simple but thrilling and effective and are done in the style of Action movies that were popular at the time and give the movie a wonderful balance to the Comedy and laughs that happen throughout BHC. Beverly Hills Cop is one of the films that would set the standard for Action-Comedies that would follow years after it's release. The film's main character Axel Foley is one of funniest and most iconic characters in movie history and is a character you will love as soon as appears on the screen. Unlike most cops on the movie and Television screen who use their guns and fists,Axel uses his Humor,wits and smarts to get out of situations that can be dangerous and other times simple. Axel can also use his smarts and Humor and pretend to be something he's not and fool some of the people he talks to and he can do it on the spot. You will laugh your head off at the things that Axel does. Also,you would think that with Axel being a fish out of water and being from the mean streets of Detroit that he wouldn't understand or fit in with the rich and high glamor of Beverly Hills,but Axel gets used to Beverly Hills and gets a kick out of it laughing at the nature of the city and it's style. For Axel Beverly Hills is a playground and Axel is having a fun time. Axel Foley is a classic character that you will never forget and will live on forever. The ending of the film is great and funny mixing wonderful laughs and explosive Action. It's fantastic conclusion to Beverly Hills Cop that will make you laugh and smile.The whole cast is great. Eddie Murphy is excellent,hilarious and at his very best as Axel Foley,with Murphy bringing wonderful laughs and one-liners to the film. An amazing performance by Murphy. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton are brilliant and funny as Beverly Hills police officers and partners Sgt.John Taggart and Detective Billy Rosewood,with Reinhold and Ashton having funny scenes with Murphy and each other. Lisa Eilbacher is wonderful and sexy as Jenny Summers,an old friend of Axel's. James Russo is outstanding as Mikey Tandino,Axel's best friend. Steven Berkoff is terrific as Victor Maitland,the villain of the film. Jonathan Banks is fantastic as Zack,Victor's hit-man and right hand man. Ronny Cox is amazing as Lt.Bogomil,Rosewood and Taggart's Commanding Officer. Gibert R.Hill is sensational and funny as Inspector Todd,Axel's boss. Bronson Pinchot gives a fun and memorable performance as Serge,an art dealer. Paul Reiser is hilarious in his small role as Jeffrey,a Detroit cop. Stephen Elliot(Chief Hubbard),Art Kimbro(Detective Foster)and Joel Bailey(Detective McCabe)give good performances as well. Also,lookout for a early role and cameo appearance by Damon Wayans as The Banana Man.The direction by Martin Brest is great,with Brest always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace. Fine direction,Brest.The score and Axel F. theme by Harold Faltermeyer is amazing,memorable and one of the most iconic scores and themes of the 1980s and of all time and matches the film perfectly.

The film also has a great soundtrack with songs by Glenn Frey(The Heat Is On),The Pointer Sisters(Neutron Dance),Patti LaBelle(Stir It Up,New Attitude),Vanity 6(Nasty Girl),Harold Faltermeyer(Axel F.)and more.

I haven't seen it in decades until now. I can't believe how actors change their form of comedy over the years. And Eddie Murphy truly defines that. He used to be bold, raunchy and didn't give a crap about being image conscious like our society has become. Here in Beverly Hills Cop he just dominated his way through bar-none. From the opening scene where goes undercover selling cigarettes to some rather shady dudes to the engaging finale, Murphy sells his character without any real effort. Even though he's very funny, there are moments where falters on being way too serious. Yes every time I see this movie it brings a tear to my eyes. And the reason for that is I know Murphy can still provide solid comedy but all he does know is little kiddie film like Daddy Day Care, Pluto Nash, and Norbit.Axel Foley (Murphy) is a cop from Detroit who is a man of great potential, but his weakness is that he is very aggressive. He has all the right tools to be a cop, He is smart, dedicated to his job, but he is also very headstrong. Behind his superior's back he arranges undercover busts,which makes him not a model employee. One day a chum from his past pays him a visit. When they arrive at Foley's apartment, two thugs attacked him knocking Foley out and killing his best friend. The two thugs are professional hit men. Foley was demanded by his boss to stay away from the case and ventures off to Beverly Hills where he takes some time off from police duty. His friend last took a job in Beverly Hills and this is where Foley has an epiphany that his friend's boss may have been a conspirator behind his murder. Foley encounters some cops from Beverly Hills and the action and comedy gets underway.Overall, this movie is nothing more than just kicking back and enjoying the memorable ride. The slapstick factor is proved quite effective and the action is quite effective. But the highlight of the night is when Axel talks trash and boy does he ever throughout the 1 hour and forty-five minute duration. The dialogue is easily funny, but also at the same time it is sharp and the dialogue is quite intelligent. The music is quite fitting for the time period even though it is dated by today's standards. Director Martin Brest's formula was proved successful.For a 105 minute film, this movie flows at pace faster than a blink of an eye. It's just an above average action comedy cop movie.People who have followed Eddie Murphy since the early 1980's are familiar with the type of comedy that Murphy was at the time famous for. To the people who only remember Eddie Murphy for kid-friendly fluff like Haunted Mansion, and Drillbit Taylor will be shocked that the Eddie Murphy they know now used to make more edgier films and never cared about being image conscious.

However where the humour drops, so too does the film.The strong support helps the film and both Reinhold (surely not!) and Ashton give good performances.  Cox is always watchable and the stage-struck Berkoff can certainly play a cartoon bad guy when he has to (see also Rambo 2).  Resier and Pinchot round out the cast of familiar faces.Yes &#150; it's not exactly new or clever, and some of the humour is crude and dated (every comedy in the 80's had to have a scene in a strip bar &#150; I think!) but with Murphy's fresh drive and energy in the perfect vehicle for him this turned into a big hit and rightly so.

It's certainly better than the recent Showtime. And the soundtrack can't be beat. I'm forced to admit, however, that those not wanting to experience some nostalgia can find just as good cop flicks from the 90s and today.Who should see this film-- Action film buffs on a rainy day, or if you lived throughthe 80s and somehow missed it.

Both have certainly got all the makings of a great action movie. Eddie Murphy shot to stardom as Axel Foley, still his best role, bringing the right mix of everything to the part. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton add equally-good support as the Beverly Hills police detectives who become involved with Axel's hunt for the murderer of an old friend. Their old married couple-like bickering (the very direction Martin Brest gave the two actors) is great, especially considering a good deal of it was ad-libbed by the two actors. And who can forget Bronson Pinchot's small part as Serge, the art gallery worker?Producing team Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer get the most out of everything, from the chemistry between the three leads to an excellent 80s soundtrack. Not to mention Harold Faltermeyer's awesome electronic score (still unfairly unreleased by itself to this day), containing one of the most identifiable movie themes ever. Gilbert Hill is a riot in a brief role as Axel's police chief (his chewing out of Axel in the station locker room is probably one of the most-remembered scenes of the series), and Paul Reiser is funny in a small role as another Detroit detective.I also really enjoyed the sequels and was glad (and a bit surprised) to see Paramount give them some good DVD treatment, and I look forward to the long-planned fourth film, though when or if we'll ever see it (with Murphy having seemingly found a new home in kid movies like DR.

In it, he combines action with comedy, and fuses together all the elements of '48 Hours' with 'Trading Places'. What made him successful as a serious actor in '48 Hours' he uses as a cop in 'Beverly Hills Cop', and what made him successful as a comedian in 'Trading Places' he uses to appear as a non-threatening black cop who is acceptable to mainstream audiences. From this moment on, Eddie Murphy would no longer be seen as a serious actor, but as the epitome of comedy-drama films of the 80's. In addition to Eddie Murphy's contribution, one cannot forget the fantastic score that went straight to number one in our pop charts.

His name was Axel Foley.  Axel Foley is a Detroit police officer who goes to Beverly Hills, California to find the men who killed his best friend.  When he gets to Beverly Hills, he finds that the law there is a lot stricter than it is Detroit.  As Lieutenant Bogomil(Ronny Cox) says,Here in Beverly Hills, we do everything by the book.  So Axel goes about finding the crooks his own way.  His investigation leads him to Victor Maitland(Steven Berkoff), a shady art dealer with possible drug connections.  So to help out Axel with his investigation, two detectives are assigned to watch him in case he gets into trouble.  They are Sergeant Taggart(John Ashton) and Detective Rosewood(Judge Reinhold), probably one of the best comic duos in comedy history.  Beverly Hills Cop is probably Eddie Murphy's best film role to date.  I'm surprised he did not win his Golden Globe nomination for his performance.  I mean Beverly Hills Cop is filled with some of the funniest and most profanity-laden dialogue in film history.  There are so many classic action scenes and jokes as well, such as the cop-truck chase in the beginning and the banana-in-the-tailpipe gag.  My personal favorite scene is the locker room scene where Axel's boss (Gilbert R. Hill) walks in begins his barrage of f-words.  Special praise should go to director Martin Brest for keeping the action tight and jokes funny.

It spawned two sequels, but this is easily the best in the series.

Great job reviewing one of the best classic action films ever.This is my favorite film and one of the best classic action films from the 80's of all time. Yes I grew up with this film, that always fascinated me how this film is fascinated, awesome, brilliant and very funny. Eddie Murphy kick's ass!!! A freewheeling Detroit cop pursuing a murder investigation finds himself dealing with the very different culture of Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills Cop is a movie made successful entirely on the performance of its star. The film is fairly shallow when it comes right down to it -- really, it's a whole lot of talk, a fair bit of comedy, and only a little bit of action -- but Star Eddie Murphy's (48 Hrs.) charisma and complete mastery of his character is what makes Director Martin Brest's (Midnight Run) movie a fan-favorite success. Outside of Murphy, Beverly Hills Cop is as routine as routine gets; a standard cops-and-robbers plot, no mystery, and point-and-shoot and in-the-raw direction make for an otherwise dull picture, but Murphy saves the film from its own shortcomings with so much flair and genuine excitement that this might be the all-time best of any of the actor-singlehandedly-makes-the-movie movies. Beverly Hills Cop is the very definition of a star vehicle, a movie that's nothing without its lead -- this specific lead at that -- but with him? It's a movie that's always masking its mistakes behind Murphy's big smile and quick-to-the-punch comic style and timing that he's got going on no matter the time, place, or circumstances in the story, selling the character and his actions with a startling effortlessness that transforms him into Axel Foley in every scene. Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is a slick, smooth-talking Detroit detective who's disobedience and disregard for procedure has once again landed him in hot water with his Chief, and a promising career is on the brink of disintegration. Axel Foley is Eddie Murphy's best role that made him in to a star today. Beverly Hills Cop is a 1984 American action comedy film directed by Martin Brest and starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street-smart Detroit cop who heads to Beverly Hills, California to solve the murder of his best friend. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox, Lisa Eilbacher, Steven Berkoff and Jonathan Banks appear in supporting roles.This first film in the Beverly Hills Cop series shot Murphy to international stardom, won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture, was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) in 1985. It earned $234 million at the North American domestic box office, making it the highest-grossing 1984 film in the U.S.Beverly Hills Cop is always on the precipice of disaster, the picture teetering on the edge but always pulled back from the brink by Murphy's contagious enthusiasm and pure comic timing. About half the film, it seems, is constructed almost exclusively of scenes featuring Murphy's character being chewed out for his actions that take place in the other half of the film. Whether he's defending himself in front of his superiors or defending his life on the streets of Detroit and Beverly Hills, Murphy consistently and perfectly juggles the film's requirements for action (as sparse as the action may be) with what is almost always subtle but extraordinarily effective humor that always flows from the story and feels genuinely off-the-cuff, rather than force-fed into the plot just to try and squeeze out a laugh from its audience. It's the film's sense of real, genuine storytelling, then, that outside of Murphy, is its greatest asset. The film is awfully standard, yes, but it's never mechanical, instead playing as completely organic. The interplay between characters seems perfectly natural, as does the humor, and it's all thanks to Murphy's uncanny ability to carry the movie with so much natural swagger and charm that Beverly Hills Cop is so much fun in spite of what would otherwise be a forgettable loser of a movie. The heat is on in this fast paced action-comedy starring Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley, a street smart Detroit cop tracking down his best friend's killer in Beverly Hills. Axel quickly learns that his wild style doesn't fit in with the Beverly Hills Police Department, which assigns two officers (Judge Reinhold and John Ashton) to make sure things don't get out of hand. Dragging the stuffy detectives along for the ride, Axel smashes through a huge culture clash in his hilarious, high-speed pursuit of justice. Featuring cameos by Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot and Damon Wayans, Beverly Hills Cop is an exhilarating sidesplitting adventure!I love this film, it is one of the funniest movies that I've ever seen.

Here we find the villain and the architect of his friend's demise Victor Maitland, learn his nefarious ways of avoiding customs, smuggling drugs all under the noses of Beverly Hills Police Department.

The only bit that felt out of place/awkward was a cameo by Damon Wayans playing a stereotypically gay man. The plot is mostly straightforward Eddie Murphy's best friend gets shot and he goes to Beverly Hills to investigate, but what makes this movie great is the interactions between Eddie Murphy and all of the people he meets, which serve as straight men/comic foils to his laid-back, joking persona. If I had one major quibble with the movie though, it's the lack of a charismatic villain, but the banter between the main characters easily overcomes it. There's even some spectacular action scenes.

That's when I found the Beverly Hills Cop trilogy.Eddie plays fast-talking Detective Axel Foley who meets up with an old buddy of his who apparently was let out of prison five months earlier. Their reunion is cut short when they're ambushed by a pair of hit men and Axel's buddy is killed as a result, luring Axel to Beverly Hills to investigate his friend's murder (against his Chief's orders, of course). I'm not going to reveal much more than that, other than the fact that he finds himself in over his head stumbling upon a drug smuggling operation.One thing I'd noticed about this movie is that it's the first one where Ronny Cox plays a character (Andrew Bogomil) I didn't want to push out a window myself (having only ever seen him in Verhoeven's Robocop and Total Recall). Also along for the ride are Judge Reinhold (Billy Rosewood) and John Ashton (John Taggert), both of whom are ACTUAL Beverly Hills cops that befriend and help Axel. Even Bogomil turns out to be one of the coolest police lieutenant in all of film. These four leads are all very likable and fun to watch.The villain, Victor Maitland, is convincingly nasty and somewhat refined at the same time. What I like about the villains of this franchise so far is that all of the villains manage to be... well... villainous without acting like total psychopathic, trigger-happy nutcases.It's a fun movie that takes a lot of the fun parts of Bad Boys and Lethal Weapon without being gratuitously violent and dark. Eddie Murphy's speedy monologues are always funny and the situations he gets himself into should have had his badge taken away from him in the first five minutes of the movie, but that's all part of the fun of following him around while he does his best to prove his case to everyone else and bring justice to his friend's killer.Just watch for a fun ride and keep on the lookout for bananas in your tailpipe.

After his childhood friend is murdered, Axel assigns himself to investigate the murder, despite harsh opposition from others on the force. He travels to Beverly Hills to work for the Beverly Hills Police Department and turns the force upside down with his aforementioned character traits. Murphy is ideal for the role of Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop. Murphy's mile-a-minute conversational humor and rapid-fire wit keeps things moving at a breakneck pace, and the man has enough charisma to keep a story like this moving. Furthermore, writer Daniel Petrie, Jr. makes sure to give Murphy an ample amount of screen time so his Axel Foley character rise is given moments to be fiercely likable and someone we grow to like.And even after giving us an energetic central character, Petrie, Jr. is sure to give us terrific action sequences. For example, the film opens with a fantastic chase scene between numerous police cruisers and a large, eighteen-wheeler carrying dozens of cartons of Lucky Strike cigarettes with Axel being thrown every which way in the back of the truck. The scene goes on for about three minutes and possesses the same kind of excitement and practicalness of The Blues Brothers's famous action scenes in the regard that digital effects don't seem to be interfering with the film every chance they get.Instead, the chase scene feels much more natural and real because of the fact that it's as if we're watching a real-life car chase on TV. Another scene similar to this one is the shootout scene between Axel and two other detectives and several other goons using high-powered machine guns. The scene operates like a realistic shootout and is simply a lot of fun to sit back and watch.Another thing levying the entire film is the soundtrack, which blends the likes of electric pop and techno music that allows for an exciting mix of things. For 1984, this was an uncommon thing, and the film's frequent use of one specific techno song allow for a nice consistency and an inane catchiness to the film all around.The Beverly Hills Cop franchise is an interesting footnote in film mainly because all three films are directed by three different directors, who've had strong and prolific experience in the action genre. The first sequel was directed by Top Gun director Tony Scott, while the second sequel by John Landis, who directed The Blues Brothers. As for this film, Martin Brest mans this ship, a man whose entire career has pretty much been devoted to action comedies that pack a wallop. His camera-work and filmmaking techniques are continuously impressive, and with the help of Daniel Petrie, Jr., the story at hand never becomes shackled by the confines of dreary storytelling or even a romance. In a world where it seems buddy cop films can barely establish actor/ character-chemistry and a credible plot, it's almost shocking to see what Beverly Hills Cop does and does so well.Starring Eddie Murphy.

Although the film cost about $14,000,000 to make, it earned back almost $250,000,000...in the US alone! And, the soundtrack from the film was almost as big--with many of the songs getting enormous airtime. In fact, the soundtrack was a HUGE hit as well. And, not surprisingly, Eddie Murphy soon decided to call it quits on Saturday Night Live. On top of that, everyone seemed to be talking about the film...I can clearly remember that. Oddly, however, I didn't get around to seeing the film until now! And, now that I've seen it, I enjoyed it but also feel that the film sure would have played better back in the day than it does today.In this dramatic-comedy, Murphy plays Axel Foley--a freewheeling cop who seems to be the only one in the film who has a brain. He's smart and capable--and naturally the Detroit Police don't understand or appreciate him. One night, an old friend of Foley's shows up and after an evening partying, some assassins are waiting for them--killing the friend and sparing Foley. Clearly, Foley was not their target. Now, with the BAREST OF EVIDENCE, Foley is going on vacation to Beverly Hills to finish the investigation unofficially. However, once there, he finds the Beverly Hills Cops equally unappreciative of his talents and hassle him throughout most of the film. When the trail leads to a scum-bag named Maitland, the cops must decide whether to keep hassling Foley or jump into the fray with this out of control cop.The plot itself wasn't all that interesting to me and seemed a bit more like a plot from a TV cop show. However, this is not why folks liked the film. What folks liked, and I appreciated, was Murphy's humor--which was very much appreciated in order to liven up the mediocre plot. Is all this nonsense great? Nah...but it is quite good and Murphy's charisma was a MAJOR plus. Too bad this incredibly talented guy who made this and Dreamgirls (for which he received an Oscar nomination) also ended up making Norbit and The Adventures of Pluto Nash. Worth seeing, though you should be aware of the very crude language, violence and brief nudity.By the way, and it's not a complaint, but HOW DID AXEL GET THAT GUN IN THE BACK OF HIS PANTS AT THE END OF THE FILM?! He was shot in his right shoulder (his shooting arm) and yet the gun is stuffed in the back of his pants---in a way that could only happen if he did it with his damaged arm. And, who sticks their gun back there anyway? They'll end up blowing their butt off!!

I saw him in Shrek 1,2,3 and 4,Beverly Hills 2,Norbit,Nutty Professor 1 and 2,Dreamgirls,Coming To America,Boomerang,Imagine This,Mulan,and a few more. This film however was downright brilliant. The kick ass soundtrack,the story heck even the acting was great. So lets start with the review.The movie is about a Detroit cop named Axel Foley played by Eddie Murphy who's best mate got murdered outside his apartment room and he sets off to find out who killed his friend by taking a vacation to the lovely Beverly Hills where he meets another cop played by Judge Reynolds and another friend of Axel's who works in an art gallery. So he gets arrested for doing something he didn't do as the cops over in Beverly Hills won't believe him over who killed his best mate and that he knows who the REAL killer is.Bottom line I really liked this movie. Im not a fan of Crime movies that much,or too much profanity but this one was definitely one to stay up and watch as it was on TV last night where im from. I mean come on you gotta love the Axel Foley theme tune im sure its stuck in A lot of peoples heads now. And even though im a 22 yr old woman who loves animation,Romance,a bit of Fantasy,Drama and Comedy, Beverly Hill Cop remains one of the best films of the 1980s.WHY can't movies not be like this anymore NOW there a bunch of rip offs.

This movie was very spectacular in its own way. It was funny, action-packed, and spooky at the same time. Here is my view of the movie overall. This movie was very funny. I don't suggest it to young children because it might be too inappropriate for the young ones. There is a lot of cussing and there is some stripper scenes. But, the parents should always look at the rating before letting there child see it. Eddie Murphy has always been in movies with more cuss words than usual. The movie was also very action-packed. Whenever Eddie Murphy pulled out his gun, you were sure to lean forward in your seat. Although none of the revolver guns that the police carried was loaded, they still made it seem like there was. I love this movie and I believe a lot of other people will too if they see my view of it. Although this movie was only 1 hour and 45 minutes long, it still covered everything it should have covered. This movie is a true masterpiece to my family and I. It was phenomenal and an intriguing movie. There isn't many things this movie did wrong. This movie was spooky and frightening in its own way. It had some scenes where I wanted to cover my face with the blankets because the final scene between Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) and Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff) was like a face-off. It was very fun to watch but frightening at the same time. The movie was based on Axel Foley's friend from California coming to visit him in Detroit. Later that day, he was killed by a man named Zach. Axel follows Zach to Beverly Hills in California. Axel was looking to find who was behind his friends death, and in a way, he wants to avenge his friends death. His police department lieutenant doesn't want him involved in this case. But, he goes anyway, Axel thinks that his friend Lisa's boss Victor was behind it. Axel begins to follow Victor and his workers around. At the same time, lieutenant Bogomil from the Beverly Hills department has assigned two cops to look after Foley to make sure he doesn't do anything stupid. In a way he manipulates the two cops to help him solve his case. Foley does solve the case; although, I am not going to tell you the person who was behind it.Overall, this movie was very exciting. I really recommend it to others. It is surely a must see when your old enough, of course. I love Eddie Murphy and I am an Eddie Murphy lover.

BEVERLY HILLS COP is one of the better cop movies to come from the 80s, which was a time where many cop films were being released. Plenty of credit needs to be passed around when it comes to the film being a success but the majority of the pie has to go to Murphy who delivers a fast, very funny and very much original performance. You can't help but watch a film like this today and really wish that the actor was still doing the same type of stuff because his comic timing is pure genius here and there are just so many examples where his charm just overwhelms the viewer. Murphy is pitch perfect playing the smart aleck cop who is constantly playing by his own rules no matter what's at stake. The early scenes in Detroit where we see the operation going wrong are flawless as is the sequence where he tells his boss off. Things certainly don't slow down when we hit Beverly Hills because Murphy's given a terrific cast to work with including Lisa Eilbacher, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold among many others. The entire cast works terrifically well together and the chemistry they share constantly jumps off the screen. Again, a lot of cop movies featured fighting with one another but the perfection here is what makes this one of the most memorable. The action scenes are all incredibly good as they contain a nice mix of drama and fun. Another major plus is the now classic music score and songs, which were a staple of 80s cinema and they remain fun today. Martin Brest did a very good job at mixing everything up and making sure that the film never slowed down or got off track. BEVERLY HILLS COP has a lot going for it but Murphy remains the main reason to watch it. "},{"Title":"Ideal vehicle for Murphy.

In one of his early roles, Eddie Murphy plays Alex Foley, a cop who wants to take action on the crooks who killed his buddy and goes to Beverly Hills to track them down. What results along the way is a great number of laughs here and there. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton make hilarious co-stars, as usual. One of my favorite scenes involves Foley having room service sent to the cops watching him across the street while he shoves a banana up their tail pipe. That's just a sample of how funny this film can be. The film is similar to other great action comedies such as Rush Hour or Midnight Run. Beverly Hills Cop, however, is generally considered to me more monumental than those, most likely because it was the first of its kind. That is not to say, however, that it is the best of its kind. I find the latter two films to be funnier, though I don't have a lot to complain about with this one. My only problem with this film is the substantial amount of strong language. If this bothers you as it bothers me, I suggest you find an edited-for-TV version or a special version edited for content to remove the profanity. Without that, the film will be much more enjoyable and less of a distraction.

Roughly five months of large screen first release and a colossal box office take later,and Murphy was now roundly a bona fide film star.Twenty-three years of box office,rentals and re-plays on everywhere from TNT to Comedy Central make this film's plot a given. Suffice it to say,to watch Murphy's Axel Foley(and to realize what kind of bizarre alternate universe of casting this film could've been party to,one need only consider the ethnicity of the name Axel Foley to know that Murphy was NOT who the filmmakers originally had in mind for this role)use his wit,street smarts and physical agility to cut through facades in facades-a-plenty L.A. to find the very bad dudes who offed his childhood buddy is STILL like watching a work of art. Director Martin Brest must've felt like he'd been given a gift from Heaven in Murphy,whose improvisational skills and ability to keep the kinetic-ism of the action probably made it easy to roll the cameras. Ditto for actors Judge Reinhold,John Ashton,Rony Cox,Lisa Eilbacher,Gilbert Hill and JOnathan Banks(As the heavy),who get to play straight guy to Murphy's riffing detective. Other than a near-hammy swishy art curator played by a pre-Perfect Strangers Bronson Pinchot,there is little competition as to who controls the show's tempo or flavor.

Let me tell you...it doesn't disappoint. It is not particularly original - I have seen this sort of cop-buddy movie done about a thousand times before, along with the 'renegade cop' thing. But Beverly Hills Cop stands out as one of the better ones of its genre. One reason for this is Eddie Murphy. Lately, his presence has been a waste of screen time - look at him in The Haunted Mansion! But here, he seems in his element - he's fresh, he's likable and he's pretty funny at times. He always seems to inject his humour at the right times, like when he rants on about Michael Jackson and defuses a potentially awkward situation. Beverly Hills Cop is a slick movie, it must be said. It may just be Beverly Hills, but there is a slickness about the movie which is noticeable. For example, the expensive hotels, the luxury cars - yes indeed, Eddie Murphy's character, Axel Foley, is really out of his element here. A real...fish out of water. Foley, you see, is used to living in the 'ghetto' that is Detroit - crappy car, derelict buildings - no, Foley doesn't have it easy. Another thing which apparently doesn't exist in Beverly Hills is the unorthodox nature of Foley. I am just thinking about how unoriginal all of this really is - the stupid chief, the renegade cop who is always right, etc, etc. But it still works better than a movie like Die Hard 2. Mind you, Die Hard 2 is not a bad movie (see that review for more), but Beverly Hills Cop has something that Die Hard 2 doesn't...maybe some humour. Or maybe the fact that there is no strip bar scene in Die Hard 2! ) The theme music here is memorable, as well.The acting was OK I guess. The only one who really does well, like I said, is Murphy. Steven Berkoff is somewhat cold (although not really menacing) as the villain of the piece, while the rest are adequate.As well as being a good comedy, Beverly Hills Cop also delivers on action. There is a good shootout near the end of the film, at what I believe to be the same mansion which was used in Commando. The chase scene at the start is also eyecatching and I couldn't help laughing when Foley threw one of Berkoff's thugs into a buffet. And what about the banana trick? Overall, this is a good action movie which provides some good comedy as well. It does not score any points for originality, but it does deserve it's reputation as one of the better cop-buddy movies. Although I would never call Beverly Hills Cop great as such, it is still definitely worth a watch or two. I could definitely watch it again.4/5 stars "},{"Title":"Instant Classic!!","Date":"29 January 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" The Beverly Hills Cop trilogy is my favorite movie/series.

He gets on the wrong sides of the Beverly Hills police force and is watched and followed as he intimidates and annoys Berkoff.Axel is a cop who is as cool as they come, anything goes as he jokes his way convincingly into situations.

One day his best friend Mikey Tandino visited him and got shot dead at his apartment. Therefore Axel went to Beverly Hills to investigate Mikey's murder, where Mikey used to work for a famous art dealer Victor Maitland.This was a typical guy movie in which Lisa Eilbacher's character Jenny Summers was only a small role. Axel, Jenny and Mikey grew up together in the same neighborhood and they were great friends. And now Axel came to L. A. to find the people who killed Mikey, and Jenny owned an art gallery, which belonged to Maitland.In one scene when Axel took Jenny to his hotel room, Jenny sat on the bed and asked How long are you gonna stay?, with a big smile and full of anticipation. Til I find the man who killed Mikey, Axel replied. Obviously this answer was a huge disappointment to Jenny, who I personally think, intended to have sex with Axel.I also think that this film portrayed gays and less macho men in a stereotypical and satirical way. Indeed, there were various scenes contained such matter that did make me feel funny and laugh, but ultimately, this is not fair to homosexuals.Nevertheless, Beverly Hills Cop was still a marvelous movie with the actors' outstanding performances which made me laugh out loud and dazzling car chasing and action. Eddie Murphy was particularly lovable in this film, in comparison with some of  his other work.

He is a man who believes in justice and truth, he isn't afraid to get the job done even if it means getting a little dirty along the way. Axel Foley isn't your typical play by the rules type of police officer. Axel Foley is no basic police officer. The film Beverly Hills Cop begins with Axel Foley in the back of a semi truck along with two tough gang members in Detroit, Michigan. He is negotiating on a price for the untraceable drugs which he had supposedly packed into cigarettes. They are interrupted when a police unit rushes in with there sirens blaring; the police are oblivious to Axel's undercover operation. All of a sudden shots are fired, one man falls to the ground and the other jumps into the drivers seat and takes off, with Axel still in the trucks trailer. A wild police chase erupts with collisions and explosions throughout the city of Detroit and when the truck finally runs out of steam the police realize it is Axel working on an unauthorized case. This is not Axels first time to work undercover without authorization; and as a matter of fact the city of Detroit and the police chief are not happy with Axel's stunts. The city seems as if it was steamrolled and shredded to pieces. Axel is given a final warning from his police chief and threatens to take his job away if he pulls another stunt like that. Shortly after being sent home from work due to his crazed actions Axel witnesses the death of an old friend named Mikey and is driven to crack a case across the country in Beverly Hills. Here is where the movie truly begins to take off, Axels chief told him to stay away from the case, but Axel being the rebel police officer he is knows he can not stay away from the murder case of his best friend. He decides to take a vacation to Beverly Hills where Mikey had worked for a man named Victor Maidland. After some investigation on Victor Axel is arrested and taken down town and becomes very familiar with a few of the Beverly Hills police officers. Axel is picked up from the police department by an old friend named Jenny. She works for Victor and was also a good friend of Mikey's. This works out perfectly for Axel because she is able to get him access to buildings in Victors business and give him inside intel that eventually solves the case. The remainder of the movie is all about Axel investigating Victors company searching for clues and evidence to solve the murder case of his friend. He eventually becomes close with police officers who were originally sent to follow him and get him under tight watch. These officers eventually help Axel solve the case and are with him throughout the end of the film. Throughout the film Axel does many things that shouldn't be acceptable for a police officer to do. He goes under cover when he is not authorized to do so, he carries a gun outside of his jurisdiction, he goes to strip clubs and does many other asinine things that a cop is not expected to do. He bends many of the rules and even the laws that police officers are expected to abide by. Even though Axel makes many risky decisions he solves the case and does a really good job. He takes many bad people off the street and cleans up the city of Beverly Hills. If Axel would have done anything differently in the film, the outcome would have been much different. If Axel would have played by the rules and listened to his police chief, he would never have solved the case of his good friend. If he wouldn't have taken police officers that were on duty to a strip club, he never would have gotten a lead that would lead them straight to the source of the murder. Breaking the rules in Axels case was well worth it. Although he had to face a lot of opposition from his senior officers and take a lot of heat from his colleagues. A major case was solved because he wasn't afraid to finish a job regardless of the consequences. Axels bending and breaking the rules type of behavior was a necessary procedure in order for him to be a successful police officer. In the case of Axel Foley and Beverly Hills Cop risking your job, life, and reputation are worth doing something that you believe in. Overall the movie is pretty average, this is your typical police action movie with a bit of Eddie Murphy's comedic twist. So if you have the time go ahead and check out the film Beverly Hills Cop "},{"Title":"couldn't finish it","Date":"13 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" I was too young to watch this movie when it came out in the 80s and so recently I tried to watch it for the first time on Netflix.

When he plays a tough Detroit cop who is sent to Beverley Hills to investigate the murder of his friend, I thought there would be some opportunities for Murphy to get absolutely hysterical. Wrong! Due to a ridiculous script and horrendous directing from Martin Brest, Beverly Hills Cop' was doomed from the first sentence of dialogue. The opening sequence with the credits made it look like a sentimental crime story with shots of the people of Detroit as if society was weighing down on them. Next we have Eddie Murphy as an undercover cop dealing with some crooks before getting in a destructive, audacious car chase. There's more ridiculous action where that came from. There is a shootout that of course has sharp shooting good guys with handguns and bad guys with machine guns who couldn't hit a tree from three feet away if their lives depended on it. Most tragically, this doesn't even feel like a comedy! Martin Brest isn't sure if he wants this to be action- packed, funny and silly, or dramatic. If I has to define this film by it's mood, I would call it a ridiculous action film instead of a comedy. Many say that this spoofs cop films, which is far from the truth. It feeds off of cop films instead of trashes them. With guns, action, bosses, crooks, and every imaginable thing to happen, this is a film that is impossible to find something good about. Murphy doesn't have room to shine due to his quiet character who only gets cocky when in danger. The real tragedy is how it doesn't blend comedy and drama well to make it a dark comedy, which would have been stellar. With zero subplots, were stuck with a boring story that fails at almost everything.

Now it's all routine, cynicism, and calculation. As long as the film makes money, nothing else matters. That's not an attitude that can sustain the film industry in the long run.

It's sort of its own classic genre and it's epitomized by Beverly Hills Cop. The movie is nothing near sensational, especially considering how the genre has transformed simply by virtue of technology, but it has a niche near and dear to the hearts of many.Eddie Murphy stars as Axel Foley, a detective for the Detroit PD with a knack for doing things the theatrical and brash way. After getting an earful from his boss, a friend is killed and Foley decides to investigate his friends' case (despite warnings from his boss), which will take him to Beverly Hills where he gets caught up in some drug pushing. He also has a couple of LAPD guys on his tail making sure he stays out of trouble, which of course he doesn't. In fact, he ropes the two of them into it.Murphy is far and away the best part the movie. His lines are well written as he plays this foul-mouthed troublemaker that always keeps the moment awkward with a tone of voice and jokes that completely don't fit the situation. The rest of the cast is pretty much garbage. A few good roles here and there, but the acting is mostly forgettable.The story isn't too important. It just sets up situations for Foley to be the rule-breaking, crazy cop who never learns but always comes out on top. It also sets up some neat chase/action sequences, which consists of the film crew driving trucks like wrecking balls down a street full of cars and bashing everything in sight.The film also makes itself a very clear tribute to the grooves of the 80s, many times when those songs are completely out of place. The film's iconic synthesized theme works, but the rest of the song choices add too much of a playful, not-serious tone for a film that does try to be a crime drama in ways.Beverly Hills Cop is certainly the antidote for a case of haven't seen enough 80s action movies lately, but other than that it's just a plain cop drama with an interesting main character.

Murphy is cast as Axel Foley, a Detriot policeman with authority issues who travels to Beverly Hills to learn what happened to one of his close friends. He discovers the ultimate adversary in villainous Victor Maitland (Steven Berkoff of Octopussy), while he cannot get his head around how the Beverly Hills Police Department operates. Eventually, he makes friends with two blue-collar cops, callow Detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold of Fast Times at Ridgemont High) and Rosewood's gruff, no-nonsense partner Sergeant Taggart (John Ashton of Midnight Run) who have been dispatched to conduct surveillance on him by their immediate superior, Lieutenant Bogomil (Ronny Cox of Deliverance) who wants Axel out of town. Axel isn't the kind of guy who gives up easily as everybody comes to realize with dire chagrin, especially Maitland. Axel's Detroit Police Department Captain, Inspector Todd (Gilbert R. Hill) is the only person that Axel seems to respect. Anyway, Beverly Hills Cop is fast-paced fun with all the dull spots edited out for maximum velocity from the early scenes in the Motor City when he busts cigarette smugglers to his repeated clashes with Maitland and his minions, most memorably Zack (Jonathan Banks), the evil villain who killed Axel's friend and loves to brag about the feat. Martin Brest made his reputation with this top-flight action thriller. Before Beverly Hills Cop he made an amusing oldsters actioneer with George Burns, Art Carney, and Lee Strasberg entitled Going in Style. He went on to helm the top-notch Robert De Niro bounty hunter thriller Midnight Run. The bouncy orchestral theme by Harold Faltermeyer became a popular hit.

Director Martin Brest has a pretty unique body of work afterward. He scored 2 Oscar nominations for Scent of a Woman (the film that won Pacino finally his Oscar), but seemingly killed his career in 2003 with Gigli and has not directed a movie ever since. Beverly Hills Cop was the highest grossing film from 1984, ahead of classics like Indiana Jones, Gremlins, Karate Kid and Ghostbusters. Quite a good year for cinema with a winner that you would not necessarily expect. Probably thanks to the commercial success, the script received an Academy Award nomination, and Harold Faltermeyer's excellent soundtrack scored some recognition at award shows as well. He had to wait for the sequel to get his Oscar nomination though. Fittingly for its audience numbers, the film also won People's Choice Award for Best Movie of the Year.Eddie Murphy was a rising star back then. He got a Golden Globe nomination, his second already after Trading Places and an earlier Best Newcomer nod for 48 Hours and all this in his early 20s. There have been two sequels already for Beverly Hills Cop in the 10 years after the original, but judging from what the critics say, the quality got steadily worse. Maybe the possible 4th film, which could come out in 2016, will be received better again.I personally found this film work much better as a crime thriller than as a comedy. Murphy's usual stick has never been really my cup of tea, but it's not so bad that it destroys the whole movie. His character is as loud, obnoxious and smart as you know it from Murphy's other works. The film has all the ingredients one rich evil antagonist, violent scary henchmen and a good-looking female, who has even less to do than Bond girls usually do. It is all a bit predictable, but I liked the ending with the reference back to the made-up story Murphy told earlier in the film. That connection was nicely written. You could summarize this film as a story about a cop who goes from New York to Beverly Hills to solve the murder of his friend (oh back in the days when males could still tell males I love you without the audience smelling any homoerotic tendencies). Decide for yourself if you want to give it a go. If you do and if you have seen Breaking Bad, you will find the young Jonathan Banks (Mike Ehrmanntraut) in the cast as well in one of the bigger parts including a shootout scene with Murphy.

Most of the enjoyment you'll get out of this derives from his sense of humor (not to mention that laugh). It's pitch-perfect casting, and that trivia about Stallone originally being considered . . . man, that would've been a completely different movie.But there's a real camaraderie that forms between Murphy, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold once they're all working together, and it's thanks in no small part to the actors' chemistry.

I've seen him in a couple of okayish movies (THE GOLDEN CHILD, METRO) but most of his filmography I wouldn't go near.

There are a bunch of familiar faces (Ronny Cox, Steven Berkoff, Paul Reiser) but the really interesting roles go to Judge Reinhold and John Ashton. Watching the effect Murphy's character has on them is a lot of fun.That's good, because the action is fairly routine and there are no twists that you won't work out well in advance.

It is about a Detroit cop who goes on 'vacation' to Beverley Hills to attempt to investigate the murder of a childhood friend, despite the fact that he is not allowed to. Beside watching it again because I had not seen it in a long time, I also noted that I have reviewed the third movie, but not the first and thus decided to rectify the situation. The one thing I do like about movies is that to rewatch them does not take anywhere near as much time as it does to re-read a book.This film is hardly original the cop that acts on instinct and is pretty much a loose cannon that gets results, and the setting of a cop going outside of his jurisdiction, and against orders, to investigate something that is personal to him. What makes this movie great is Eddie Murphy and the role he plays as a fast talking cop that is able to get what he needs simply through verbosity.One thing that stands out is how that contrast Beverley Hills with Detroit. Detroit is a dirty city with run down buildings and a busy and dilapidated police station. Beverley Hills is completely the opposite. While in Detroit you are after real criminals, the most that a Beverley Hills Cop does is to keep the peace. I note that on a number of occasions the cops are quick to arrest Foley (Eddie Murphy) and it is clear that he does not fit into this world. It is also interesting that because of the wealth and the reputation of Beverley Hills, it is almost inconceivable that its residents are criminals, at least to the police force. However, where there is money there is also corruption.The one thing that makes me raise my eyes is how Foley was intending on paying for his room at the hotel. It is clear through the movie that he cannot afford the $300US a night that they charge, and that is on top of all the added extras (such as sending food out to the cops who are watching Foley), though at the end the Beverley Hills Police end up picking up the tab (mighty generous of them, though I suspect that a lot of questions will be asked nonetheless).This is a heaps cool movie, and for those who have not seen it I would recommend watching it at least once. To me, Eddie Murphy created the fast-talking, quick witted, smiling cop (though he doesn't always play cops), and this movie is one of my favourites.

"},{"Title":"Largely unexceptional farce, made watchable for the odd moment that is far removed from its meagre plot and derivative nature.","Date":"31 August 2013","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" It is a relief that Eddie Murphy is as good as he is in Beverly Hills Cop, otherwise the film wouldn't be as tolerable as it is. Away from the jokes; the wisecracks and the sheer arrogance of the man, we sense his Axel Foley is someone tough enough to dish out a beating but equally hard enough to take one. The film isn't particularly good on its own, but had it been so unbelievable that Foley was in it for the gags before having to go through a fight because the screenplay demanded it, it would have fallen at the first hurdle. As for the rest of it, there isn't necessarily anything interesting here; it cracks along, tries too hard to impress with its second unit material and maintains an uneasy line between comedy and black drama. There can be little doubt that the film is made up of bits from others you've already seen the revenge story that sees a tough individual traverse a distance to investigate; the eventual plot that has much to do with narcotics and the uneasy combination of black and white, of carefree and regimented in the central character pairing. The trouble is, each of these things were better when you first saw them.At the core of the picture is how a ragtag, unorthodox cop from somewhere as rough and ready as Detroit can bring a little carefree energy to the stiff procedure driven folks in Beverley Hills. A point is made early on as to how the Californian police officers cannot break their stiff routine when the chance of getting themselves out of trouble is offered for sake of a lie to a superior officer. They pass it up, preferring to take the heat for their actions if it means remaining truthful &#x96; when the time comes to establish what everybody's learnt from the exercise that is Beverley Hills Cop, it is to tell us that the stiff cops have come to embrace bluffing to the suits in charge if it means cracking the case and getting away with avoiding ramifications. How Martin Brest tells this tale is essentially in the mould of what you might get if you merged Get Carter with The Cannonball Run, a revenge story about a man far from home told under a colourful umbrella of different parties out for a similar thing &#x96; each getting in each other's way and tripping over one another in the process.Beginning in Detroit, the aforementioned Foley has shown the brash initiative we will later learn is synonymous with his character in that he's decided to infiltrate a smuggling ring without authorisation. When things go wrong, he bears the brunt of his police chief but we sense Foley is suffocated by narrow-mindedness out of the fact the chief cannot see all the good work Foley was responsible for. Plus it was ultimately the untimely appearance of a squad car which blew the operation. From here, we get a brief taste of what life in Detroit is like for those occupying it; the film in no hurry and refusing to play its hand. People live rough, they swear; they occupy sleazy pool halls and make stupid bets on one's ability to pull off trick shots &#x96; one person is even gunned down in cold blood. In spite of this, Brest doesn't want to gross the audience out too much; there remains, throughout, a distinctly fruity atmosphere of fun and frolics. This is not a film directed particularly well, but often its dialogue and willingness to crack on with things it knows are not particularly smart in that B-movie way.About that instance of someone being gunned down in cold blood it ends up being the film's catalyst out of the fact it was a friend of Foley's who had come over from Beverley Hills to visit him. Unfortunately, he had brought too much of something else with him and incurred the wrath of a hit-man. Distraught, Foley takes time off work but is warned by his chief of treading too close to his usual ways of playing the lone-wolf and hunting for the perpetrators of the killing. Thus, the titular Beverley Hills Cop is born when he heads over there in his raggedy car to investigate a name his former friend mentioned. What unfolds is not so much a detective story per se, but a series of scenes based upon the fact Foley already knows who's guilty &#x96; he just needs to work backwards from the right answer and land something on the antagonist guilty of some seriously amoral stuff in a world where affluence can buy you into rarefied circles free of accusation. Steven Berkoff fills this void and does so with a slimy relish, amply supported by a doughy eyed second-in-command thug assassin.Away from the case, the film must flesh itself out with a series of scenes depicting the police force of the area questioning Foley, while the scenes that play out wherein Foley just doesn't seem to belong in Beverly Hills are done so with a sort of confident relish that just feels heavy. The fact of the matter is, Foley is not a fish out of water beyond the racial and class distinctions; he is a police officer mixing with other police officers striking us as someone following up on leads the locals cannot bring themselves to fathom for the fact the suspect is who it is. The stubbornness of the locals in this regard is so hard to break down, that the film must resort to the villain engaging in a straight-up case of kidnapping so as to prolong a police presence for the final shootout. Where by no means a disaster, the film didn't do an awful lot for me beyond individual bits and pieces that were often as good as they were out of Murphy's delivery. In the long run, this is fairly poor a middling-to-bad effort.

Here are the few parts I found pretty funny in this flick.Spoilers!!! 1) The exchange in the back of the truck with the ciggeretes2) Axel meets Serge for the first time. (I think Bronson Pinchot is hillarious as the prissy worker at the art gallery. Needed more of him in the flick)#3) the scene at the strip club is funny4) The many different characters eddie plays, such as the Ramone, the customs security officer etc...But the problem is that these scenes are too short and far between.  Plus the actual plot looks like it could have been lifted off of an episode of Knight Rider. I hope that the sequels are better3)  "},{"Title":"Being Poor Makes You Tough.","Date":"6 November 2010","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" I never know quite what to make out of this movie. Yes, the Beverly Hills police get skewered -- along with Beverly Hills culture in general -- and if Beverly Hills represents the realization of the American dream it certainly deserves skewering. The materialism blossoms like a fungus in a vast spiritual void. You ought to see Rodeo Drive. One millionaire's shop after another and a constant parade of customers groomed and dressed identically in thousand-dollar jeans. It's like a Theme Park. I wouldn't want my kid to grow up there.But to ridicule the locus while exalting the obnoxious figure doing the ridiculing raises entirely different questions of taste.Eddie Murphy is Detective Axel Foley from Detroit, at the time the murder capitol of the nation. He's poor. He's savvy. He's black. He's everything they're not. Murphy giggles as he drives his beat-up clunker through the city (if it's a city) and eyes the ritzy hotels and jewelry stores. He's on a quest for the murderers of his good friend back in Detroit and has reason to believe the trail starts in Beverly Hills. It does, and it ends there too.Meanwhile Murphy teaches the uptight local cops how the cow ate the cabbage. The local cops are stupid beyond belief. They follow the rules. They call people sir and they say please when they tell a suspect to do something. The Beverly Hills cops act like Boy Scouts, squealing on each other and on themselves. They're clean. They're well spoken. They're white. His opposite number is Judge Reinhold, than whom no one can possibly look and sound wimpier.Well, that's just about the whole story. Murphy acquires a white girl friend without quite acquiring a white girl friend (this movie will be shown in Jackson, Mississippi), he brazens his way out of complicated situations and exploits his environment. He insults people of his own color for not behaving as if they were black enough for him. He violates the law at every turn. When he walks in public he looks back over his shoulder and chuckles at the two gay guys who just passed him, although they've done nothing comic.The musical score, though, is full of an appropriate zest. Reinhold acts as if his IQ were about as high as his body is in inches. Eddie Murphy often uses his big grin, wide mouthed persona, familiar from television, and sometimes it works for him, but when he tries to sound sincere, he does his best but there isn't a moment when he doesn't sound like Eddie Murphy trying to act. He was more effective when he was more subtle, doing the same number on the excessively rich in Trading Places. It's mildly amusing but I couldn't really get with it because I don't find insults in themselves funny. You want to see a very good movie involving the police of Beverly Hills? See Straight Time, if you can find it. "}{"Title":"A total '80s movie.  And how did Martin Brest degenerate into Gigli?","Date":"8 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Comedy, Crime","Review":" Beverly Hills Cop is the sort of movie that I would usually give 10/10, but there unfortunately is a major problem with it. The movie presents no challenge to the status quo, portraying the police as the good guys.But other than that, the movie is pretty funny. With Eddie Murphy in as Axel Foley, one gets the feeling that they must have had fun making it. Which of course brings up a few questions How did director Martin Brest go from this to a piece of dreckola like Gigli? Why is Eddie Murphy currently doing movies like Daddy Day Care? What ever became of Judge Reinhold? Oh well. The point is that you're sure to enjoy this movie, even if it is a total '80s movie. Neat.

But that doesn't help make it an entertaining movie again to modern audiences. All the clich√©s are there the rookie cop with unconventional methods, the tough lieutenant, the woman in peril, the evil drug-dealer, fish out of water, etc. Been there, done that. I had high hopes for this movie based on the good reviews, but in fact I was just bored most of the time and only got a few chuckles out of it. Yep, Eddie's shtick didn't make me laugh this time. (Check out his comedy albums if you want the real thing.) I can only give it 4/10, and that's being generous. "}]
