[{"Title":"Fun and occasionally sad live-action cartoon","Date":"3 February 2003","Score":"20 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":"  Dean Jones plays a race car driver who meets a pretty young woman (Michelle Lee) he sees working in the window at a fancy car dealership. He pretends to be interested in a car, but the dealer has nothing he can afford.  Well, actually, that's not true.  There is one little Volkswagen Beetle that was purchased by a woman who also bought a Bentley. She bought it for her maid but brought it back because the car misbehaved.  Jones isn't interested in the car, but it follows him home.  Cops show up at his place accusing him of stealing the car, which of course he didn't.  Jones blames the sleazy car dealer for this, and for the strange behavior the car exhibits when he tries to drive it.  The car has a mind of its own, and its special qualities make it good for racing.  A romance develops between Jones and Lee when Lee tries to convince Jones the car is normal but soon finds out the truth.  Lee can't stand Jones at first, of course.Eventually Jones decides to keep the car and race it, but the car dealer wants in on the action, offering to buy this special car.  Jones won't sell to him, but he eventually sells to a Mr. Wu (some people may be offended by stereotypical portrayals of Chinese people, and Wu starts out as a stereotype but later seems quite sophisticated).  The car dealer tries his best to keep Herbie from being a success.Jones and Lee did well in their parts but they seemed like they were acting.  Buddy Hackett was quite good as an artist who creates works out of car parts and later served as Jones' crew.  Hackett named the car Herbie because it reminded him of his uncle.  And the actor playing the car dealer was delightfully evil.  The special effects were amazing for the era in which the movie was made.  It really looked like the car could do some amazing things. And of course the car seemed to have a personality, one that made us like it.  The racing scenes were quite well done, and it's hard to believe there were not more wrecks.  Maybe the cars were filmed at slower speeds than what we saw.  While quite funny, the movie also had its tender moments and could even be sad  Herbie tried to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge, for example.  I didn't really see anything to concern parents, though maybe it was a little violent for the littlest ones.

In the film, we learn rather quickly that race car driver Jim Douglas(Dean Jones) has hit rock bottom after being a prominent race car driver(what caused his demise? it's not explained but it appears that he got into quite a few bang ups). He lives with a Buddhist named Tennessee Steinmetz(Buddy Hackett)who finds a soul in everything.Jim soon looks for a new car and comes across a fancy dealership, only to be embarrassed by the owner Peter Thorndyke(David Tomlinson) who refuses Jim's $80 offer for a gorgeous race car. While in the showroom, a VW rolls in that was supposed to be scrapped. As Thorndyke berates the little car, Jim sticks up for it and soon the car thinks it has a friend and follows Jim home. To avoid being blamed for stealing the car, Jim agrees to buy it from Thorndyke but the car acts up. Jim is about to return it when he's caught in a drag race because someone makes fun of the VW. Herbie blows the competition away and Jim falls in love with the car's speed, but Tennessee knows it has heart and names it Herbie.Soon Jim, Herbie and Tennessee are winning races and Jim's ego inflates while Thorndyke's temper grows since he too races and loses every time to Herbie. Thorndyke decides to sabotage the little car and when he succeeds, Jim turns his back on Herbie. Once Jim realizes HE hasn't being winning the races he tries to find Herbie who has since run off. Herbie gets impounded after an accident and Jim must sell him to a Chinese man who agrees to let Jim drive Herbie in a big race. If Jim wins, he gets to buy Herbie back for a buck. Needless to say, Thorndyke once again sabotages Herbie,but hey, this is Disney. Who do YOU think wins out at the end? I had to give this movie a 10 because it has so much going for it. Comedy, some drama, romance. We know very little about Jim Douglas except when Tennessee describes him as down on his luck, angry, and one who was prone to getting into trouble. Jones did an excellent job as the cocky, angry, egotistical driver who is knocked down a few pegs by his friends and a little car. The character mirrored Jones back then, who admits in his biography that he was a dirt bike racing nut prone to losing his temper quite a bit and having an affinity for women other than his wife. Michelle Lee is grand but we don't see much of her and Hackett plays the sincere bit amazingly well especially when he tells Jim that he was nothing without Herbie. For comedic relief David Tomlinson was terrific as was his assistant Havershaw(Joe Flynn of McHale's Navy fame).Yes there are some over the top, goofy and somewhat embarrassing sight gags and a few interesting moments(i.e. Carol thinking Jim has ulterior motives when Herbie brings them to a make-out point, i.e. when Herbie tries to kill itself, and when Jim finally admits to Carol that he's just a bum), but the film has heart, like Herbie. The film had three more sequels, a five part TV miniseries, a re-make in 1998(or so) and there's a new film coming out. Jones only did Love Bug, Monte Carlo(film 3), the miniseries and made a pathetic appearance in the 1998 film. In each one, Jones was still down on his luck but nothing like the sad figure he portrayed in Love Bug. Great classic film, filled with 60's nostalgia.

What if the machines we take for granted as being under our control have an essence, a life force, a soul that needs only to be cultivated to be brought out into the open?Mystic-minded hippie-type Tennessee Steinmetz (Buddy Hackett) argues that this is the case when his roommate, down-on-his-luck race driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) acquires a Volkswagen Beetle that frequently refuses to comply with its driver's demands.  Tennessee claims that the car is alive, and names it Herbie.  Jim doesn't believe this for a second, but that doesn't stop him from using the car's unusual speed to bring success to his previously undistinguished racing career.  Meanwhile, Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson), the snobbish and hot-tempered owner of the dealership where Douglas bought the car, is having fits over Douglas' inexplicable winning streak.  A race driver himself, Thorndyke becomes Jim's (and Herbie's) primary rival, resorting to increasingly sneaky tactics to prevail on the racetrack.  Jim believes his own driving skill deserves the credit for his newfound success, but finally comes to believe the truth about Herbie in time for the final climactic race.By far the funniest and best of Disney's Herbie series, The Love Bug is silly fun that's still smartly written enough to be fun for all ages.  The special effects are somewhat dated and primitive, but they suffice.  It's not easy to make a car show emotion, but here it's done with surprising effectiveness.  It also doesn't hurt that as a car, the VW Bug has a lot of personality to start with.  The human actors do well too; Dean Jones makes for a likeable hero, and Michele Lee the love interest.  However, the real comic gold comes from Buddy Hackett as the offbeat Tennessee, who in Jim's words is `just in off a flying saucer,' and David Tomlinson as British rival Thorndyke, whose angry outbursts are deliciously over-the-top without crossing the fine line into obnoxious overacting.

He always get's into accidents. He goes to stay with his spiritual friend, Tennessee. Next day he goes to a local car store that sells European Imports, but what caught Jim's attention were two beautiful legs, belonging to Miss Bennett, who was hanging signs on the window. Jim meets the owner, Peter Thorndyke, a greedy and a not-nice man (played by David Tomlinson, who's a vetera Disney actor). As Jim leaves, he notices a Volkswagen Beetle (after it bumps his leg).      He also notices that same car in his front yard the next day. Everyone claims he stole it but he knows he didn't, so he purchases it and finds there's something different about it. Like, he wants to go one way and it wants to go the other. It also has cheeky ideas, like when Miss Bennet and Jim go for a ride in it to prove it's normal, it stops them at Seabreeze Point.        Tennesse believes the car is special. He names it Herbie, after his Uncle Herb. Jim enters the little car in races and boy does Herbie race a mean race! Jim's back on his feet, and Thorndyke, despite his efforts to cheat, is always left in the dust. He's very angry, so one night, while Jim and Miss Bennet (Carol) were on a date, and they took The Special, Thorndyke pays Tennesse a visit. They suck back some Irish Coffee and get so drunk that when Tennessee is asked what part of Ireland he's from, he responds Coney Ireland. Get it? Thorndyke also gives Herbie some of the stuff, and Herbie can't handle liquid, so his system is all messed up. He get's fixed and sees Jim bought a new car, so he runs away and Jim tries to find him.         He finds him and also finds out that Herbie caused somevandalism. To Mr. Woo's Fish Market, but Mr. Woo offers to sponser Jim and the car in the El Dorado race because he learns the car can become his. So Jim, with the aid of Carol and Tennessee, enters the race. So does Thorndyke, and cheats! But the next day, it's Thorndyke who's left in the dust and Herbie wins first--and third place! Because he literally went to pieces!         A happy ending! It's followed by three sequels. Dean Jones reprises his role as Jim Douglas in the third one Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo. There was also a TV series and a TV movie.

The Love Bug is a wonderful film for the family. Filled with adventure, comedy, and sweetness it is perfect for kids of all ages. When Jim Douglas, played by Dean Jones, starts to have a fluke in his racing career he almost gives up hope. He is stunned by a car dealership that is owned by Thorndyke, played by David Tomlinson, where he first runs into the famous Herbie. After standing up for the little car, Jim has found that the little car is his for keeps.After winning numerous races, Jim believes it is his luck and not the little car. Tennessee, played by Buddy Hackett, knows that it is the little car and not Jim. Tennessee also influences Carole, played by Michele Lee, who took a little more convincing. Thorndyke tries many evil and cruel stunts to win Herbie back. After a mere loss, Jim has to prove himself to the little car and to the rest of his friends.A big race is where Jim believes he will do it. The race is two days long and in those two days the little car will be tested to the limits. Herbie rides on water, rides with only two wheels, and even comes apart. Thorndyke is a true bad loser and is actually intimidated by the little car. This will determine who the better person in the end is.The actors in this movie are truly acting and the content of the movie isgood as well. Robert Stevenson did a wonderful job directing this movie. Having the actors know how to act and having the little car doing all of the stunts played a really made a difference in this movie. As for the little car, I would like to know how they made him come to life so well that kept my interest for fifteen years. This is a wonderful movie and families every where will fall in love with Herbie and the rest of the cast.

The performances are excellent, especially David Tomlinson makes a gorgeous comedy villain. However, Dean Jones' play is equally recommendable, as the heroic lead is a much less rewarding role in pictures like this - while Tomlinson can just go for full throttle lovable nastiness, Jones needs to provide just the right dosages of heroism, arrogant charm, etc. to keep his character believable and flawed and likeable.

At the beginning of the movie, he is totally dependent upon himself, not thinking the little car he is driving is actually doing it all for him. At the end, it is totally different. Michele Lee (Carole) helps to tame Jones really well and works very well at supporting Jones. Buddy Hackett (Tennessee) is a very interesting and funny character to watch - his belief that Herbie has an inner person in him, talking to Herbie as if Herbie actually had a real soul, and so on. David Tomlison (Thornkyke) as the movie villain is so cool. His lines are funny and his actions are engaging to the very end. Herbie himself is great providing all the laughs as well as only a Volkswagon can. Herbie was what really inspired me to want to get a VW bug.

This little Volkswagen offends his dignity somewhat and Tomlinson abuses it. Jones defends it however.But what neither of them know, but Jones soon finds out is that this unprepossessing beetle has a mind all its own.

He's been given a name now, by Buddy Hackett who plays Jones's mechanic. He's the first to really realize how special Herbie is.I'm willing to bet that those who succeeded Uncle Walt at the Magic Kingdom never realized just what a franchise The Love Bug would prove to be. This and all the succeeding films made lots of money for the studio and Herbie still has plenty of life left in him as his most recent outing a year or so ago with Lindsay Lohan ought to prove.Herbie's quite the romantic too. He even helps win the heart of Michele Lee for Jones. But this is a Disney film so that's kind of a given. This first Love Bug movie had a good cast of supporting players who were finding the Disney Studio their employer of last resort. Where else can you see someone like Iris Adrian in a brief, but very funny role as a carhop or Joe E. Ross as a policeman?

Simply because it takes place on it, the wacky suicide attempt scene on the Golden Gate bridge is one of my personal favorites in the picture.Storywise, Dean Jones stars as Jim Douglas, a depressed and washed-up racing driver. In a posh automobile shop owned by Peter Thorndyke (David Tomlinson is wickedly funny!!!) Douglas meets Herbie, a white Volkswagen that was returned that day by a lady who was having problems with it. Thorndyke kicks the little car viciously, and when Douglas stands up for the VW, the little car decides that it wants Douglas for its owner.It's true, you don't get a concrete explanation why Herbie is alive with a mind of his own. The closest thing you get is Eastern philosophy from Douglas's friend and racing assistant, Tennessee Steinmetz (the lovable Buddy Hackett) a Jewish man who learned, while on a trip to Tibet that life is everywhere, even in mechanical objects like traffic lights and cars.When Douglas discovers that Herbie not only has a few problems that a little adjusting can fix, but that the car is capable of amazing speeds, he re-enters auto racing and is soon collecting trophies and prizes.Douglas has yet to learn, from Tennessee, his new friend Carole (Michelle Lee) and from Herbie himself, that in the quest for validation in life, some people are capable of selfishness and stepping on others' feelings. The somewhat arrogant Douglas refuses to believe that Herbie is a living thing, that it is only a car, and that it can be replaced...especially if it fails to perform to standard. Walter Pidgeon's character in BIG RED was similar. Once Red didn't win a dog show, the guy sold him.When Herbie destroys a gorgeous candy-apple red Lamborghini within minutes of Douglas bringing it home, the human finally understands what is going on, and goes through a huge transformation with Herbie.Yes, yes, it's a comedy. I know. It's loads of fun and Tomlinson has the best lines of all. Even hearing him scream, HAVERSHAW!!! is a joy, as well as seeing Herbie poop and pee on him in retaliation for his dirty tricks!

Dean Jones delivers correct bewilderment but doesn't exactly seek answers as to why his car acts more like a pet. It is obvious that he will win the race because of Herbie, and we are treated to a lame tree climbing joke that should have been scrapped the moment it was thought of. Michele Lee plays a potential love interest and that is about the height of her involvement. Buddy Hackett is the sidekick mechanic with all the personality of a can of motor oil. David Tomlinson and Joe Flynn are hilarious as over the top villains. It showcases one's love for automobiles in a whole new way. It also showcases one's desire for foolishness.

Now to start with I'm thinking that Cinderella's fairy godmother or the three good fairy's made Herbie come to life. lol. I also like the paint job on him especially the patriotic look. This movie is also from 1969 the year Woodstock was around and the Beatles released their album Abby Road which is my favorite album from them. Now Herbie is a funny and an amazing little Volkswagen vehicle that anyone can drive. I also remember seeing Herbie in the Planet Hollywood restaurant in Disney World last year. He's also at the Disney All Star Movies Hotel. So when Jim Douglas first saw the car he thought it was a fine looking car, but didn't know about it coming alive until it came to his house. Herbie also brought Jim and Carole together. Also Peter Thorndyke the main villain play by David Tomlinson who also played Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins is obsessed with having the car for his own and turning it whatever he wants it to be. So during the El Dorado race he try's to get Herbie for his own by cheating but thanks to a few tricks up Jim's, Tennessee's, Carole's and Herbies sleeves and hubcaps they managed to beat Thorndyke and win the race. Tang Wu who owned part of the car after Herbie crashing into his meat stand in Chinatown gave Jim back Herbie and Jim and Carole got married and went in Herbie on their honeymoon. As for Thorndyke and his henchman Havershaw got reduced from car salesmen to lowly mechanics. This is a good movie for all families to watch for many generations and who are really into racecar driving. The Love Bug is definitely a Disney classic.

He goes on to have a lucrative but somewhat stereotyped role in motion pictures. All the movies which follow this one have him playing the same role. It's sad when non-living things get typecast. I know this bothered R2D2 quite a bit as profiled in the documentary 'Behind the Dome' (if I got the title right). Herbie goes on to star in 4 sequels, a re-made for TV movie and a short lived TV series.The title of the film seems to indicate that the main crux of the plot involves Herbie playing cupid to Dean Jones and Michelle Lee. Although the little bug does try to play matchmaker it's much more about Herbie being a race car, kinda like the Mach 5 in 'Speed Racer', accept that this car is alive. But actually the film is more than just a race car movie with silly Disney Moments; it's about the complex relationship between the driver and his car.The main comic hijinks steam from the story line that this VW bug is alive with a mind of its own. The car is alive in the same way the cars in 'Cars', are alive accept that Herbie doesn't have big eyes in his windshield and a mouth in its front bumper. An amazing little bonus feature, presents a old Disney cartoon with a 'Cars' looking car entitled by 'Susie, the Little Blue Coupe' narrated by Winnie the Pooh. Herbie looks more alive in the way the Knight 2000 looks alive accept that it is not due to artificial intelligence. Maybe it's possessed like 'Christine', or has the spirit of some person like in 'My Mother the Car'. Who knows? The movie never delves too deeply into why the car is alive, but it doesn't need to. The characters in the film and the audience are caught up in the reality of the situation and the reality takes root into their hearts and minds and questions about a car being alive is naturally accepted. The film also never gives questions it doesn't answer. It's a comedy and not an in-depth science fiction film and it treats the story as such.Unlike other Disney films it takes awhile for the characters to slowly believe that the car is actually alive. Certain incredible things are sometimes processed slowly. Christian faith can be like that to someone who comes to believe in it after believing in some other philosophy (such as atheism) for some time. Thus the story line proceeds at a natural pace. The comedy springs up from the characters and the situations that they are in as opposed to having wacky things happen just to get a cheap laugh.The whole cast, Dean Jones (lots of Disney films), Michelle Lee, Buddy Hacket, David Tomlinson (Mary Poppins), Joe Flynn (Macale's Navy) and Herbie (Herbie Fully Loaded) himself are delightful folks to hang out with for a couple hours. This is a film that defiantly deserves a place in the family library, right next to 'Cars'.

A definite must see !!","Date":"24 September 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" What originally started out as an idea suggested to Walt Disney by 'stock' actor Dean Jones about the first European sports car to come to America, ended up being swept into one of Disney's most lovable and most memorable characters, Herbie. The 1963 VW who has a mind and heart of HIS own. Although Walt Disney had started a basis about a car-type movie, screenwriter Gordon Bufford came in a wrote a screenplay called 'Thunderbug' which later changes to many numerous other titles such as 'Car-Boy-Girl' and the idiotic 'Magic Volksy'. What resulted was 'The Love Bug'.Jim Douglas is a well known track car racer who is real big on doing demolition derby-type races. He lives in an old firehouse with a mechanic friend of his named Tennessee (Buddy Hackett). The two of them have a strong feeling for cars and have literally turned their home into a garage over piled with car parts and tools. One day, everything changes when Jim stumbles upon a white 1963 VW who has a mind of its own. Jim and Tennessee end up getting involved with this strange little car and notice its not LIKE ANY OTHERS. Jim realizes that this car would dominate racing tracks across the country (Tennessee names the car Herbie). Jim Douglas and his car become quite famous on the race track and build up competition with an auto dealer who drives the most fast cars equipped for racing.I can't really explain the plot too well, so I suggest you just see it for yourself. The bottom line is that Herbie has a heart and mind of his own and can control himself when he wants too. This movie and its sequels are really good (although I can't really say the same for HerbieFully Loaded though). These movies will make you laugh and you'll have a fun time watching them, as usual with most older Disney movies. This movie is a perfect model as to what older Disney films were about. Most starred adults and were really cool and fun to watch. Now Disney seems to be designing garbage for sex predators. Every movie is with girls in tight clothes and young dating and each kid has one parent, and they play soccer, plus fart jokes and some sort of talking animal. Pixar's films are good, but anything released outside of that is CRAP 99.5% of the time. That's because Disney is no longer a person, its a name, a product used up to get some CEO his 9.6 million dollar mansion in the Hamptons or wherever. The original essence of Disney has been lost. Now I know Disney was meant for kids, but don't take it literally by having kids as the actual stars ! "},{"Title":"The secret of the little car? It has heart...","Date":"24 January 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Box-office hit for the Disney Company gets mileage of out its slapstick, but is hampered by a screenplay running on empty. Dean Jones is a faded race car driver now working the stock car circuit who purchases a VW Bug with a mind of its own (when it initially prods Jones' leg at the dealership, one senses it may be flirting with him). Christened Herbie, Jones and welder-pal Buddy Hackett race their discovery at all the major tracks, infuriating the Bug's original owner, a snippy antique car dealer who also races (and isn't above dirty tricks when he loses). Writers Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, working from a treatment by Gordon Buford, give us a formula villain (David Tomlinson, acting the nefarious windbag) before turning hero Jones into a heel as well (and, along with Joe Flynn as Tomlinson's flunky, it's too many heels for one picture). When does Jones realize Herbie has the emotions of a human? There's no awe in the magical circumstance, only frustration. Hackett appears to be simpatico with the Bug--but there's no moment there, either, when Hackett realizes what the car is capable of (his character is designed to be 'nutty' for a laugh). Walsh and DaGradi push ahead with their formula without building a strong story; the team also (perhaps shrewdly) exploits the notion that Herbie has personality in order to tug at our heartstrings. Some of the special effects are amusing, but the back-projection and stock footage are sloppy, the sound quality is uneven (typical for Disney movies of this era) and the performances are variable. Followed by a handful of sequels, beginning with Herbie Rides Again in 1974. ** from **** "}{"Title":"The Little Engine That Could","Date":"16 January 2012","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","Review":" Disney gives no death or injury count for the opening credits, but San Francisco race-car driver Dean Jones (as Jim Douglas) emerges with only a scratch.

Basically down on his luck racing car driver Jim Douglas (Dean Jones) and his friend, occasionally drunk mechanic Tennessee Steinmetz (The Little Mermaid's Buddy Hackett), live together in an old run down fire house. One day Jim goes to a luxury car dealership and wants something in a rather low price range, but mean dealer Peter Thorndyke (Mary Poppins' David Tomlinson) has no interest in helping him. Then Jim spots a strange car, an old Vauxwagen Beetle, and after managing to take it away with him, it proves to be an unusual car, it has a mind of its own driving where it wants to. He believes Thorndyke planted the car on purpose, but dealer assistant Carole Bennett (Michele Lee) proves the car is a good purchase, only to discover the car is living as well, and Jim has found a love interest. After being fixed up Jim, and given the name Herbie by Tennessee, the car is more controlled by its driver, and with a high speed they start racing to be champions, against Thorndyke, who wants the car back. After Thorndyke sabotages one race to win, the big race called the El Dorado is on the way, and there is a point when you wonder if Herbie will go to it, but after the apologies, he does. So the two lap gets started, with Thorndyke seeming to cheat his way to the lead, but Jim, Carole and Tennessee in Herbie manage to catch up and eventually win the race. Also starring Joe Flynn as Havershaw, Benson Fong as Mr. Wu, Andy Granatelli as Association President and Joe E. Ross as Detective. The car doesn't have as much personality as perhaps the remake version does, Tomlinson makes a reasonably mean villain, like a live version Dick Dastardly, and the jokes are alright, it is something the family will enjoy, an alright comedy.

What makes The Love Bug work is its package of journeymen performances, off-the-wall special effects, and a thorough feeling of niceness oozing from the good guys, even when they fall off their respective nice wagons. TLB is sweet without being campy, childlike without childishness.It's a hard act to follow--the sequels have run the gamut from dull to downright stupid (unless you tuned into Lindsay Lohan's version to enjoy seeing her squeezed into coveralls), but the strength of The Love Bug is in watching your spouse and kid laughing without embarrassment.The Love Bug is delightful.

They cause pollution, they're smelly, they make people crazy, and all they do is take you places. It's the same way that I hate sports, because I have driven a car before and there's only one thing I like about that - speeding. But I understand what a car represents to people, freedom. And when you hear a person criticize female drivers, it's not hard to see that some of what they mean for you to understand is women aren't as deserving of freedom as men drivers. If they didn't mean this, they would criticize men drivers as well. And we live in a society that is obsessed with material possessions, especially cars. So it's not too far-fetched that this is the same society that accepts glorified car-speeding as a sport. I grew up with it as something that interested the family. It never interested me. All these things come together for Disney's wonderful comedy- cars, racing, women, and glory. None of those things, if think about them, really spell out comedy. But this movie is all about surprises.The thing that elevates this movie above it's rather mundane subject is that feel-good nature Disney is signature for. And so there is a likability to everything that happens. It's sort of a safety system. You can tell it will be a movie where the balance will shift back and forth between the good and not-so-good (usually it's evil, but in a comedy the villains have to have comedic value as well, think of Thorndyke as you'd think of Captain Hook, basically), and even though this makes the movie a little predictable, it's okay because you know Disney always puts things right. The key is that they do it in a very inventive and fun way. By for instance, giving the car it's own distinct personality, and a real fiery disposition. So while all the villains have on their side is their wicked devices, the good guys have a supernaturally gifted car with a heart of gold. Thankfully, the film also gives them Tennessee, the hero's sidekick who isn't very skilled as a mechanic, but he does have a talent for welding, and a wisdom that comes from places we have to imagine he's actually been.The characters in the film are a sheer delight. Although as a hero, Jim Douglas is all too common, it's very difficult not to feel sympathy for him. He has to be a little hard-headed for plot's sake but the film doesn't treat him like an imbecile or a jerk, he's just a simple guy who makes a few mistakes in judgment - as most guys do, in life as well as the movies. The movie doesn't assume he's automatically more interesting than his friends just because he's male, which makes it all the more refreshing that his love interest Carole is smart, skilled as a mechanic, beautiful, and at the same time a great assistant in helping Jim build up his confidence as well as help him win the race by tending just as much to the car's upkeep as both her fellow riders. The dialog of the film is impeccable, especially the Tennessee character's. Since the film wisely decides not to have the car talk, we need a character to be assigned to speak on behalf of the car and who better than the slightly-off welder who at times takes 'strong drink'?The hero, Jim's strongest hook as a character is that he was a winner when he was a racer and after a few losses, he needed someone new to take a chance on him. Instead of one, he got two. And in a way, everyone deserves to feel like a winner, but Jim earns his inevitable victory in the end of the movie. Hey- it's Disney, you know how it ends. The entire movie is charming. And after myself seeing dozens of Disney live-action films, I can't say they've all been even half as entertaining as this one. At times it feels a little long, but you know, so does driving. And the point of going on a drive if you're not the driver is to have the trip itself worth riding on. This one surely is.

I watched them when they came out and was mildly amused at that time, but these Herbie flicks did not age well. I can understand why they did a remake recently.I know it's a fantasy, but it just looks now so stupid it's almost beyond description. In a nutshell, we have a 40-horsepower VW bug that wins auto races because it's alive, complete with a personality and - get this - a soul! Meanwhile, the driver of the race car (Dean Jones as the annoying Jim Douglas) thinks he's responsible for the race victories. Well, at least that made sense. The film turns out to be a propaganda piece for Buddhism!! I kid you not!In fairness, Disney and other studios who have done animation have always made inanimate objects human-like and many times we laugh at that, myself included. So, I'm not really making fun of the premise but it just looks and sounds so dated 40 years later, especially the San Francisco hippie scenes.Herbie, by the way, was a likable guy. It was good to see Benson Fong (Charlie Chan films) again, and Joe E. Ross (Bilko, Car 54, Where Are You?) and even goofy Buddy Hackett as Tennessee Steinmetz. I always found it a shame, though, that humorous stand-up comics like Hackett and Don Rickles played so many stupid roles in these '60s films. "}]
