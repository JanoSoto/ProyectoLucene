Dracula 2000. Ick. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film. To begin with, an interesting cast. Christopher Plummer has, previously, suffered from what I call Michael Caine syndrome; making any film that will write him a cheque, Johnny Lee Miller was amusing in Trainspotting and, let's not kid each other, there is no mystery as to why Jennifer Esposito and Jeri Ryan were cast. Round it out with some second and third tier young Actors du jour and you probably haven't spent too much money. Now...the most irritating aspect of the film is the almost surreal amount of flagrant Virgin Records placement. Seriously....Mary works in one of the stores which means we get prominent t-shirt coverage....not to mention the gawdy neon sign, the truck in the garage etc.....however, Dracula needs virgins, right?By far the most interesting part of this film was the story behind the creation of Dracula. Taking the myth back to the time of the crucifixion, with Judas Iscariot suffering some fairly serious guilt issues leading to his suicide and eventual re-birth....good angle it helped to explain the vampires aversion to all things holy and dislike of silver (as in 30 pieces of...). Still don't get the mirror-phobia but hey....Someone on the creative team of this film has a sweet little visual gag in store. Check out the scene in the Laffayette Cemetery...there is a crypt bearing the name Spencer Hepburn. Nice one.The ending is a little rushed and it seems that Miller might have left the set early that day, since he apparently vanishes. It also leaves blatant amounts of room for a sequel, but I wouldn't hold my breath.That I even considered seeing this film was primarily due to Wes Craven's participation. However, I found it to be an imaginative and fairly tasteful modernisation of one of the all-time cinematic horror legends.

C'mon give the movie a break, it wasn't that bad. This is not Shakespeare; it's a Vampire movie, for Pete's sake. It's not after the Oscar, its entertainment. Sometimes a lot of the User commentators lose sight of what some movies are about.An example of this is a review of Santa Clause 2, where one guy wrote `The North Pole was a very distracting, annoying place to be. It seemed so far from reality'. Well I don't want to spoil his Xmas but Santa isn't reality. It was a MOVIE!Dracula 2000 was a lot better than the old Hammer movies or in fact a lot better than a lot of other Vampire moves. If you could ever do an original story on Vampires, this was close. I mean, what is in a Vampire script. Spooky guy/girl gets out of coffin, kills people (usually girls with great bodies) another guy/girl tries to kill them before they kill again. Oh and I forgot the part about the heroine is a reincarnation of the Vamps long lost love. (See Blacula, Fright Night, Dracula 1992 etc etc)Dracula 2000 was more original. At least he had a real reason for wanting the Heroine (his blood, her blood) and his origin was an interesting concept, better than Coppola's, which I still find confusing. This was never going to be An Interview with a Vampire, but it was a hell of a lot better than Queen of the Damned. If you like Vampire movies this should be on your viewing list.

British terrestrial television rarely throws up such a dilemma, so I had to consider carefully which one to select. In the corner marked 'safe option' we had Mel Gibson's Ransom (seen it; dull; can't really remember what happened but am assuming they eventually get the kid back), second was Man on the Moon (seen it; vaguely remember being a bit disappointed), and third was Wes Craven's Dracula 2000 (never seen it; presumably a straight-to-video job). Almost without hesitation I plumped for that.A maverick choice, you might say - but there was method to my madness. On more than one occasion, drunken and deluded girls have approached me in bars and accused me of looking like Jonny Lee Miller. They are wrong of course - those close to me have taken sadistic pleasure in assuring me I look more like a cross between Woody Harrelson and Kelsey Grammar - not particularly good for my sex-symbol status, but useful if I ever wanted work as a stunt double on the set of Cheers.Anyway, it turns out I chose wisely - Dracula 2000 is a hoot. More Schlock than horror (as you might expect from the creator of the Scream franchise) it has the kind of kitschy charm of Buffy the Vampire Slayer only with worse dialogue and a sillier plot. Those purists who prefer a more classic Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee tussle between good and evil are unlikely to stay beyond the first reel, but there are rewards for those who stick it out.Miller plays Simon Shepherd the protégé of the mysterious Matthew Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer). A gang of thieves infiltrate Van Helsing's secret stash of old relics and unwittingly release Dracula from his silver coffin. Big mistake. The dark lord makes a bee-line for New Orleans in search Van Helsing's daughter Mary. On his way, he creates merry hell crafting a few undead henchwomen (mostly blonde) and enjoying unspeakable depravity in the middle of the Mardi Gras carnival. Unsurprisingly, Miller and Plummer pack their crucifixes and silver bullets and hurry over to save the day.This being a sexed-up modern-day version of Bram Stoker's classic, Dracula himself is far from the urbane older gentleman with the black cloak and the widow's peak - this one is young and spunky and has the kind of barnet you might find in a L'oreal commercial. Try to imagine a bastard hybrid of David Copperfield and Alan Partridge and you won't be far off. Dracula's hair is not the only highlight though There are some brilliantly awful modern cultural references - Sweet and innocent Mary works in Virgin Megastore (geddit?) - and an audacious religious sub-plot which goes some way towards explaining Dracula's hatred of silver.All in all it is great fun. It was inevitably mauled by the critics, but I guess they don't have a sense of humour. Poor old Jonny's been in some turkeys since he made Trainspotting, but I'm backing him to hilt on this one - it certainly beats watching Mel Gibson and Rene Russo blubbing for two and a half hours.7/10 "},{"Title":"Fast, fun decent vampire flick","Date":"26 December 2000","Score":"60 out of 89 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" The story is very convoluted but it comes down to Dracula (Gerard Butler) is search of Van Helsing's (Christopher Plummer) daughter Mary (Justine Waddell) in modern day New Orleans. Let's get the negatives out of the way Jonny Lee Miller is TERRIBLE; Plummer's accent is pretty obviously fake; there's far too much product placement for Virgin Records and the vampires crack terrible jokes. All that aside the movie is quick, it's fun, beautifully and atmospherically shot. The script is interesting--it gives Dracula a new origin which fits but is pretty silly too. Dracula is a reanimated corpse...trying to give him a different origin is pretty dumb. Also, crosses don't affect vampires anymore...it just annoys them. Also there's plenty of blood and violence on hand and erotic sexual seduction by Dracula.With the sole exception of Miller the acting is good. Plummer works (despite the accent); Omar Epps is having a whale of a time; Justine Wadell is good and Esposito, Ryan and Fitzpatrick make a good team of scary (and sexy) vampires. Gerard Butler is fantastic as Dracula. He's young, VERY handsome, has curly black hair and a buff body. Also he portrays Dracula's sexuality and violence very well. So a slick, fast-moving and fun vampire movie. Worth catching.

First, watch the DVD deleted scenes, extended scenes and audition featuring Gerard Butler. That will get you in the right mood! Then start the film. The first 30 minutes are a mess. After the opening scenes with Christopher Plummer as Van Helsing, that lays the groundwork for the story, they could have skipped all the scenes about the stealing of the coffin and just had Plummer tell Simon (Johnny Lee Miller) we been robbed!. But the young people and the robbery and taking the coffin by plane and it crashing - all could be handled by voice-over. This is just a mess and not one of the actors are interesting or have any charisma. Especially Solina (Jennifer Esposito) going into the vault, dark and creepy and skulls and gad! you get the picture. We are in for a fright! Bah!!! So lame.Our first great shot of Dracula (Butler), is on the plane when he walks into the section of the plane and reaches out for Solina - and like any sane woman, she goes right to him. The love bite is next. Um Hmmmm! In the meantime, Mary Van Helsing (Justine Waddell - child like and innocent) is having dreams/nightmares seeing Dracula in her mirror. She is speechless, and we are too. OMG! She keeps saying wake up - you're dreaming but then he comes close and sniffs her and says you're real and I have to pause the film and fan myself.Troubled Mary goes to the church in New Orleans where the priest is a childhood friend, to get some answers about her Mother and as he is putting the candles out and turns to Mary - it is him, the big D. A gaze to die for. The next is Dracula perched like a gargoyle on the church parapet above the Mardi Gras revelers and he says Farewell, Princess. Perfect! Down at street level, he walks among the drunken revelers with a bemused look. There is a giant TV screen showing dancers silhouettes, there are beads and coins tossed at him as he looks on with a knowing smile. He watches the giant screen flash images of atom bombs, rock stars, lingerie ads and women mud wrestling and says Brilliant. Great satire!His walk through the Virgin record store is iconic, with all the young gals turning to look as he passes by. He gets Lucy, Mary's friend to take him to their home. His comment to Lucy, when she can't come up with a word to describe Mary's mothers decor of the house catholic? is priceless. And to her query would you like some coffee? he says  I don't drink----------coffee. Timed perfectly with just the right look. And of course, he has her on the bed and on the ceiling! Faint!!!It is like there are two films here - one a brilliant satire with great lines. And the other an incoherent teen/slasher/blood-fest. But it is almost possible to just start anywhere after the first 30 minutes and the story is interesting and makes sense of the Jesus Christ/Judas theme.The cinematography has some beautiful scenes. The Red Hall - the curtains blowing and the eastern theme music for the desert and cross scenes. The few lines Dracula(Butler) utters are great and with timing and marvelous expression. The Bible is propaganda. You think you can defend her with the Bible. To Mary Everything I have is yours; and all you are is mine. (Shades of The Phantom.)Dracula to the Jesus Cross I give them (revelers below) what they crave most. All the pleasures you denied them. And his gesture to Mary - arm and hand out as the camera pans away and he says come let us feast and the kisses. Wow!! Nellie bar the door. I want some of that!

Sloppy scripting , and there also seems to be a problem with the structure where there`s numerous scenes of characters being at the New Orleans mardi gras then the characters being at a different location such as police station in the following scene then they`re back at the mardi gras the scene after that which means the lack of credibilty in the plot is enhanced There`s something else that yanked my chain - Product placement .

With director Patrick Lussier at the helm&#x97;who certainly knows how to handle his special effects and action, and who has no qualms about dishing up plenty of gnarly violence&#x97;this had the potential to be a hugely enjoyable updating of the Dracula mythos, but the film rarely lives up to its promise.It all starts well enough, with a bunch of ruthless criminals breaking into Van Helsing's vault and stealing the silver coffin within, convinced that it contains something of immense value. Instead, they discover that they have unwittingly freed the legendary Dracula, who proceeds to search for Van Helsing's daughter Mary (Justine Waddell), with whom he shares a supernatural connection. Unfortunately, once the wheels are set in motion, matters quickly go downhill.Most of the blame can be placed on the lousy casting/weak performances Butler makes for a dreadful Dracula, his goofy grin and rugged looks more suited to Jennifer Aniston rom-coms than horror films; Johnny Lee Miller is about as emotive as a fish; and Waddell is too ineffectual to believe that she could be related to Van Helsing and infected by the DNA of Dracula. Matters aren't helped by some REALLY cheesy dialogue (Sorry sport. I'm an atheist&#x97;groan), a script that meanders aimlessly for much of the running time, and some of the most blatant 'product placement' I've ever had the misfortune to witness (even if it is slightly amusing that the company being advertised is Virgin).The inclusion of three really hot vampire brides (played by Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan) compensates slightly for the film's crappier elements, as do a few choice moments of gore and a satisfyingly spectacular demise for Dracula, but on the whole Dracula 2000 proves to be a frustratingly mediocre movie.

It gives a slight bit of originality and ingeniousness to the franchise, but it's also illogical, extremely far-fetched and it might even be considered as being a little offensive. My biggest fear regarding this film, however, was that it would be a boisterous and computerized update of the legendary myth. I'm glad to say that the visuals in Dracula 2000 are well used and not too exaggerated. Some good old-fashioned gore as well with a couple of nice decapitations and slaughtering. The script is rather weak and contains silly humorist-lines such as ` Never ever mess with an antique dealer'&#133;and a lot of variants on the `vampires suck'-joke!

We receive some quality acting by Christopher Plummer as Prof. Van Helsing and even Omar Epps is remarkable in his role. Lots of eye-candy is provided by Jennifer Esposito (I never saw her this pretty), Jeri Ryan (cleavage-queen) and Colleen Fitzpatrick (she's the modern version of Lucy).

With Dracula being drawn to his daughter Mary, Van Helsing flies to New Orleans with his protégé Simon in tow. However he arrives to find that Dracula has already regained strength and has turned several people already.I tuned into this years after it had vanished from the cinema having barely made more than a ripple at the UK box office. Seeing it on TV now I can totally understand why it didn't do much business. The plot doesn't really go anywhere and squanders any potential it may have had in a very simple little film that is all over very quickly. Taking huge jumps in plot logic (both real logic and vampire movie logic), the film throws up a few average action scenes and not much else. I wouldn't even really call it scary even if some of it made me flinch a little bit with the early gore. Neither the direction nor the script do anything to justify the update of this story and in the end it doesn't even really stand out as a good teen horror.The cast flatters the film and most of them are badly used with the bigger names playing second fiddle to the lesser names (in my opinion). Butler's Dracula is far too obvious and easy &#150; he has no real charisma but yet we are supposed to buy that he is seductive and ruthless. Miller is OK but he is not very well used and is suddenly expected to carry the film with it dumped on him halfway in. Plummer does OK but Waddell is pretty annoying. The big names of Epps, Thomas, Esposito and a few others all look sexy and appealing but the film uses them badly considering their star status (consider Epps' face being prominent on the poster to see what I mean &#150; that's practically false advertising!).Overall this is a fairly standard modern horror &#150; a bit of gore, no real scares, no real thrills, poor plotting, poor characters and only a handful of amusing kiss-off lines.

He spoke with a lisp, and seemed kinda dorky. Not too convincing. And, the subplot of the beginning. It took a long time for the story to get around to what the movie was really about.That storyline, girl born with Dracula's blood running through her veins...that's a good storyline. However, how they got to New Orleans (and why, did they HAVE to have it New Orleans, it would have been a little better taking placein London) was a bit ridiculous. The product placement of Virgin Mega Record Store was horrible. How much did they pay for that?In any event, I do not recommend this movie...unless you're a Jonny Lee Miller fan.

Thinking that there must be something valuable in the highly protected vault, a group of thieves break in, only to find a metallic coffin. As they are on their way back to America, Dracula wakes up. Being hungry, he decides to make an in-flight meal of the crew. Determined to stop Dracula, Van Helsing (Who we soon find out is THE legendary Van Helsing) and his assistant Simon (Jonny Lee Miller) track him to New Orleans. Dracula isn't there for the Mardi Gras, though It seems that Van Helsing has a daughter name Mary (Justine Waddell), who is linked to Dracula (Courtesy of Van Helsing, whose been using Dracula's blood to stay alive to find a way to destroy him).This is an interesting interpretation of the myth of Dracula. As any fan knows, it seems impossible to kill Dracula (Seeing how many movies there is about the infamous count, you can understand why). But what's interesting is to WHY Dracula exists. Exactly who he is makes this an interesting entry in the many films based on Bram Stoker's immortal character. Butler's turn as Dracula can be described as irresistible (Check out the scene when he walks through the Virgin Megastore,when all of the women just drool over him). But then, that's what makes this character hard to kill you can't help but love him.Good film to have in your collection.

In that, he had me wondering if Christine made the right choice at the end of the movie, and in this, he makes me wonder if being a vampire would be all bad! Christopher Plummer does well in the roll of Van Helsing and the rest of the cast is good. The special effects were well done, and spooky. There wasn't an excess of blood and gore (I know, not a plus to all vampire movie lovers!) This movie is only a 7 to me because it clings tightly to the vampire myths at times, and disregards them totally in other places. The best example of this is the fact that Dracula hates all things Christian, and shuns them. With out giving away why that makes sense, it's understandable considering how he became a vampire. Why, then, aren't the people he makes into vampires just as repelled by crosses and such?In spite of that, all in all, it wasn't a bad way to spend a Friday night!

But what I really love about this film is the way it uses and re-purposes vampire lore. It uses all the usual clichés skillfully, but the best part is the new backstory they give Dracula. It's unlike anything I've seen, yet fits perfectly, neatly explaining most of the idiosyncrasies he has. Beautiful, absolutely beautiful, and I do hope it catches on.And that's Dracula 2000.

In my opinion, Wes Craven here presents the most novel and compelling re-envisioning of the Dracula story since Lugosi. As far as originality and a fresh direction, this makes Coppola's production seem like a bloated but tired, over-produced rehash. Yes, Gary Oldman is a consummate actor and a great Count. But in Francis' version, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are totally flaccid and uninteresting. And Anthony Hopkins embarrasses himself with such an over-the-top portrayal of Van Helsing that I wouldn't be surprised if Oldman hasn't talked to him since. Tony almost seems to be purposely lampooning the story.Don't expect $100 million special effects. Craven had to make do on a shoestring budget. But that seems to have forced him to focus on the story rather than the flash. Butler could certainly have upped the intensity rather than relying so heavily on his drop-dead good looks to establish Dracula's charisma. No question, Gerard underplays the role, though that only seems to add moodiness and atmosphere--and is consistent with the character as he is presented in the story. Dracula is so bitter and internally conflicted that he hasn't got a lot to say to his victims--or even his pursuers. Also conflicted is the wonderful Christopher Plummer, who is so present in the role of Van Helsing that he really sells the premise of the whole re-invention in the film's first few minutes.For levity, Dracula's new brood of followers have a lot of trendy, new-age comments to make on the pluses and minuses of their new, undead status. They come off as Katzenjammer kids with fangs--but as amusing as they are, they still bite. They seem to be the only ones really having fun here vampirism as a form of delightful liberation right up until the moment the stake sinks in.As Drac movies go, this is a winner. By the way, Plummer has been criticized by some reviewers for his curious pronunciation of the Count's honorific. But it is actually proper. If you were addressing him as Count or Vlad, yes, Dracula would be the correct form. But if it's the only identifier, then the single term Draculea, just as Plummer pronounces it, is correct.Three cheers for the Count. Although Butler isn't quite as pretty here as Langella, he's got more to work with as far as engaging and original backstory. And he is spared Olivier's Van Helsing as kvetching crybaby. What it is about Van Helsing? No one did it better than Edward Van Sloan until Plummer came along in the 21st century.

Face it Bela Lugosi in flashy evening attire just isn't going to scare anyone these days. Nor is the ketchup-spattered Christopher Lee. Today, what scares us is that there's a battle going on all around us, and it's no fantasy. There are no clear heroes, and too often our closest allies look a lot like the villains. Both sides use the best technology they can get their hands on.Dracula 2000 features a strong, virile new vampire; a frightened-but-spunky 21st-Century heroine, over-the-top action (for its budget) and a moderately clever new beginning for the vampire myth.

Whether it was needed or not, the film attempts to update an old tale with a hip and trendy cast, a heavy metal soundtrack, and a visual flare that resembles the so-called music video/MTV aesthetic of the time. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.From the cast to the script and the overall tone of the film everything in this adaptation reeks of Scream-era horror, which should come as no surprise given Craven's involvement and the fact that the film's first-time director, Patrick Lussier, spent the better part of his career working under Craven's shadow as an editor on the Scream franchise and many similar films. Thankfully, Lussier (who went on to direct two direct-to-video sequels to the film, as well as the recent My Bloody Valentine remake) learned the ropes rather well during his time under Craven. The film has undeniable style and even at times when it tries to be dark and serious (a goal that this film doesn't quite reach), is enjoyable and harmless. Its action scenes are somewhat derivative of The Matrix and other films of the time, but are a blast, never-the-less, and help amp up the enjoyable camp factor of the film. While the film isn't necessarily bad (or subsequently, good), its biggest flaw is that its script is rather contrived and convoluted. Again, the question is raised of whether or not the film is needed, and unfortunately, the dim storyline at hand doesn't do much to justify its existence.On the acting end, Gerard Butler is a solid casting choice as Dracula himself, and goes a long way to make the film what it is. Then there's Christopher Plummer, adding a touch of class to his role as a descendant of Van Helsing. The likes of Jennifer Esposito, Omar Epps, Sean Patrick Thomas, Danny Masterson, Jeri Ryan and Vitamin C (remember her?) show up and do okay, but like many horror flicks of the time that sport a hot cast, are in turn, disposable and forgettable for the most part. Thankfully, Johnny Lee Miller and Justine Waddell are likable enough as the main protagonists and help keep you from cheering for Butler's Dracula too much.To be blunt, this film is purely and simply dumb fun. If you are willing to let your guard down and can appreciate a film that takes many liberties with its source material, you'll find that Dracula 2000 has a lot of entertainment value. It's certainly not the best take on the material or even an effective horror movie in its own right, but aside from its problems and the fact that it almost immediately dated itself upon inception, it's at least an admirable and ambitious effort that recalls a time when horror &#x96; for better or for worse &#x96; wasn't as hardcore and unflinching as it is now.

In Dracula 2000 Gerard Butler gave the most intoxicating, believable (for fiction) portrayal of Dracula I have seen to date. Interview w/ a vampire, Queen of the Damned, and so on only cracked the surface. Letting us see only the hype behind the legend that has lasted thousands of years. Whereas Dracula 2000 may not have been as well received as the others, it touched a part of the legend that others haven't dared--the tormented soul. And for those Anne Rice fans(and yes, I am one too) Louis wasn't Dracula, so he doesn't count. Anyway, Gerard Butler pulled off beauty, touched slightly by cruelty, and shadowed by torment that I truly believe anyone would be hard pressed to outdo. My best to you all, Vanessa.

These are very important to have to make a film successful. The most enjoyable thing about this film was Dracula because he was portrayed as having emotions rather than rage as previously portrayed; furthermore, with this added quality, I almost felt sorry for Dracula because of the story he told.I need to give the cast credit because they made it much more enjoyable because they brought attitude and humor. Rising stars were discovered in Justine Waddell, Gerard Butler, Jennifer Esposito and Sean Patrick Thomas; furthermore, veteran Christopher Plummer added credibility to an already stable film that could have survived on its own.It was a pleasure to sit through this film because I didn't know what to expect next; furthermore, it kept me on the edge of my seat.

I have always enjoyed vampire films and the mythos of the undead, in general, but I never particularly cared for the concept of Dracula, the super-vampire. Yet, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Now, let me tell you why. This was a complete over-haul of the Dracula story. It had all of the bloodsucking gore and ultra violence typical of modern horror movies, but, without delving into the plot too much for fear of spoiling the great concept which is revealed, I will say it is the most clever concept I have seen or read dealing with the origins of the nosferatu, putting Dracula at the start of it all, explaining where HE came from, as well. The writer of this script has completely thrown out the ramblings of that drunken irish madman (Bram Stoker) in favor of a story which utilizes even older vampire mythology.  Specifically, I speak of The Vampire and His Kith and Kin which is a much older work and actually considered to be non-fiction in that it doesn't tell a fluid story but instead collects old folk tales about the nature of vampires dating back to their origins in the middle ages. Ideas from this are clearly used, and used well, I might add. Beheading and the use of silver as means to dispatch a bloodsucker are two themes you rarely see in recent vampire films and are taken directly from the old myths. And what is clever about the film is how they don't stop with the inclusion of these concepts but take it even a step further by explaining, not only why these things work, but in the process, where Dracula comes from, and more specifically, WHO he actually is. Yes, folks, that's right, there's a mystery afoot! The casting and acting of the film was well done also, although from the appearance of the actor playing the title character, one almost expects that this was originally meant to be an Antonio Banderas vehicle. And I, for one, would like to have seen that since he did such an excellent job the last time he played a vampire (Interview's Armand). Anyway, I would definitely recommend this movie to any fan of redefined horror, or vampire enthusiasts in general.

Christopher Plummer adds an air of authenticity to the film, as any actor as seasoned as he would.There are many 'classic' story elements that are used in the film, and I loved seeing Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick, & Jeri Ryan in their roles as Dracula's brides/servants.

He is described as an archetypal vampire. Wes Craven takes this premise and updates the novel idea to the year 2000 where we find Abraham Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer), who has tangled with Count Dracula (Gerard Butler) in the past, working as an English antiques dealer in New Orleans. Simon (Jonny Lee Miller) is a vampire hunter in training under his apprenticeship. Van Helsing and Simon travel from London to New Orleans to rescue Van Helsing's daughter Mary (Justine Waddell) from the family's life long nemesis - Dracula. And in the process we meet all manner of 'turned' victims and originals played by Colleen Fitzpatrick, Jennifer Esposito, Omar Epps, Sean Patrick Thomas, Danny Masterson, Jeri Ryan, Shane West and even Nathan Fillion as a Priest.It must be the campy outing of this film that convinced fine actors like Christopher Plummer, Gerard Butler, and Jonny Lee Miller to jump on board for this movie.

It just has a bubbly feel, and while not a dead teenager movie, has the same sort of thing going on -- with a few effects from The Matrix thrown in.And while some of the plot seemed wrong (I do not know why we needed Dracula's three brides, a girl named Lucy and other throwbacks when we already established that the Bram Stoker book exists in this world), I generally liked certain aspects -- the way to keep Dracula imprisoned, and the concept of using leeches to filter vampire blood. Not sure why that would work, but it is a good concept.Many big names here, especially Christopher Plummer and Gerard Butler before he broke into the A-list. Certainly not the worst Dracula movie out there, even if they were more focused on selling a soundtrack than making a movie.

The world's most popular vampire has had numerous appearances in film. Only Sherlock Holmes has appeared more times as a major character in the history of film. In Dracula 2000, the familiar Victorian England and Transylvanian settings are replaced by modern day London and New Orleans. I suppose this is an attempt to keep things fresh. Unfortunately, the transition fails.Some major characters from the novel make an appearance. Obviously, Dracula is the main villain. Gerard Butler plays the role. His appearance is more romantic than frightening. I can't say that he acted bad, but he failed to carry the weight that we expect from the character. Van Helsing, the hero, reflects most of the features that we expect, but fails to be memorable in any way. In fact, he doesn't even play too pivotal of a role. The other characters, including Helsing's assistant Simon and Helsing's daughter Mary, are uninspired. In general, acting was mediocre.The plot is structured after the novel, with a few major changes made to fit the new time period. This transition is flawed. The new story spawns several plot holes and odd ideas. If you ignore dissecting the plot, then you might enjoy some of it just for the horror elements. But as soon as you start to think about it, it breaks down.The one thing that I did find interesting was the conclusion. It has sloppy editing and questionable stylistic choices in an attempt to give the illusion of fast paced action. I found it entertaining, but this is probably because it is so bad that it becomes good.The concept of Dracula 2000 has some serious setbacks. Although I admit that I would like to see a good modern adaptation of Dracula, this is not the way to go. The execution suffers even more. Most people will go into Dracula 2000 expecting nothing more than it is. At the bare level, it can be enjoyed. But I like having more meat in my movies.

I really liked the notion of Dracula not being killed and instead imprisoned for life by Van Helsing.The rest of the film seemed a bit rushed to me. Not the effects or the acting but the plot line. Johnny Lee Miller's character seemed to just accept that vampires were indeed real; he basically goes from a shocked outsider to a capable vampire hunter in the course of one night. It really seemed like the transition from the old vampire hunter (Plummer) to the new (Miller) was too rushed. In my opinion, they could have made this better by having Van Helsing confide in Simon from the start. That would have made more sense and allowed for a smoother transition.The idea that Dracula was much older than his traditional 15th century roots was neat and so was the idea that he was in fact Judas. That did well to explain his hatred for Christianity and for silver.Overall, it wasn't a bad movie; it could have been better but I don't think this was intended to be anything more than what it is. Some fine acting by Gerard Butler and the rest of the cast saved this film from being a B movie. "}{"Title":"Better than you think","Date":"30 April 2007","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Now I'm not a huge fan of most Vampire films and TV series. The subject has had the life sucked out of it (no pun intended!) so many times, by so many people, who feel they have a unique take on the idea, and often change only one or two variables ever so slightly. It is a fascinating sub-genre of supernatural fiction, but since the original Bram Stoker tale, there have been few stories to stand out, with rare exceptions like Matheson's 'I Am Legend'.Dracula 2000 (Or 2001 in the UK) stands out by genuinely doing something unique and different, in the midst of all the Buffys and Blades. There are some very neat twists, not all original, but combined to create an enjoyably satisfying film, though the final revelation stands out as one of the most interesting concepts in recent years, from an otherwise tired genre. For once, the religious undertones of the Dracula myth are used to good effect, truly integrated with the story, while the characters, even the most minor, are often at least amusing and engaging.Also to its credit, perhaps surprisingly for such a film, are the performances. Gerard Butler makes for an excellent Dracula, while Justine Waddell shines as a convincing and nuanced lead. Christopher Plummer plays an interesting and world-weary Van Helsing, with Johnny Lee Millar as his protégé, plunged too early into the thick of things. Even the supporting cast is strong, with the likes of Jennifer Esposito, Omar Epps, and Jeri Ryan, obviously relishing their roles.The film is obviously aimed at a young audience, yet while modern, is surprisingly restrained, never trying too hard to woo the all-action 'Blade' or 'Matrix' audience at the expense of its story or credibility. The script is sharp, witty, and intelligent, while Marco Beltrami's score sets the mood perfectly, and Carol Spier's production design gives everything a suitably detailed and textured atmosphere.It's not a perfect film. At roughly around the 90 minute mark, it sorely screams out for more character based scenes, yet these are small concerns for a movie that can honestly hold its head high, in the overly polluted sea of vampire fiction.

For me, that's what makes it so enjoyable. New Orleans seems to be the favourite setting for films that encompass decadence, seduction and sinister indulgence within its themes. While the dialogue may not be of Shakespearean proportions and the acting at times, can dip its toe into the pool of pantomime, the film itself is very enjoyable. But most of all, it offers a new take on the ideas of Dracula's origins.All in all, this movie fares a lot better than I thought it would. For one, the casting is tremendous. Gerard Butler's Dracula has to be one of the most menacing, sexy and downright cool portrayals of the fanged one ever brought to screen. Johnny Lee Miller is savvy and slick as the noble, yet slightly unlikely crusader-against-all-evil/antique-dealer. Jeri Ryan, Jennifer Esposita and Colleen Anne Fitzpatrick all ham it up with relish as a trinity of Dracula's sinister and seductive 'Brides'. Christopher Plummer's eccentric and slightly insane Van Helsing is pure class, proving he can be as unhinged as you like, and still look good in a three-piece suit. The only one I think lets the movie down is Justine Waddell as Mary Heller. Tough as it may be to constantly be in terror, she doesn't do such a grand job. She's cold, prissy and damned annoying. Now, if you knew Dracula was after your immortal soul, you'd put up a bit more of a fight really, wouldn't you? The soundtracks are also top-notch, and it brings the Dracula story bang up to date. You have to laugh, as Dracula stands transfixed under a huge video-wall blaring out a choice heavy rock tune along to images of gyrating strippers, nuclear explosions and body piercing. Brilliant! he says. Although after being locked in a coffin for a hundred years, a Westlife music video would probably seem like a work of genius to this poor guy.As anyone who watches a vampire film will agree, one of the things that makes a film like this good, is the gore factor. The film doesn't disappoint, although it's a little more subtle than some would like. There's some amusing beheadings, vampire attacks, and even one or two short fight scenes thrown in for good measure (although I'll never understand why all vampires seem to have a certain amount of martial arts expertise). All of this, and it still manages a few good one-liners, like Simon's victorious Never, ever f**k with an antiques dealer! As long as you try not to engage brain too much and let the pretty colours, pretty actors and pretty soundtracks entertain, you won't be disappointed.

It's a normal night just like any other until a gang of thieves force they're way in, tie the security guards up & break into Van Helsing's vault. Inside they they discover little apart from a coffin & a few deadly booby traps, in a panic they decide to take the coffin as it's better than nothing. Van Helsing is worried as he alone knows the significance of the coffin & the evil that it contains. While on a plane in the air the gang accidentally release Dracula (Gerard Butler) who either kills everyone or turns them into Vampires as the plane crashes in a New Orleans swamp, the location is far from a coincidence though as Van Helsing's daughter Mary (Justine Waddell) lives there. Van Helsing has been injecting Dracula's blood into himself for years so he has the same immortality as Dracula & he has inadvertently passed Dracula's bloodline onto Mary, as the only other person like himself Dracula wants her as his bride for all eternity...Directed by Patrick Lussier I thought Dracula 2000 was far better than I had expected, I took one look at the title & I feared the worst but I think Dracula 2000 is a fun, decent & throughly entertaining teen horror. The script by co-producer Joel Soisson moves along like a rocket, you'll barely have time to catch a breath & at times it's perhaps a bit too fast as the character's never really come to the fore at any time. Dracula 2000 is basically a modern day telling of the Dracula story with it's own unique twists & turns. The film is also very daft & silly at times, from underground crypts, the immortal Van Helsing, The Matrix (1999) style slow motion martial arts fighting & more besides. The script seems to try & cater for a teen audience with it's constant one-liners amongst the more serious dialogue for the connoisseur. There are some neat little references in Dracula 2000, I liked the fact that Dracula's bride to be Mary worked at a Virgin megastore, Mary, Virgin & religion get it? Very clever. The name of Van Helsing's business Carfax Abbey is also the name of the house Dracula moves into in Bram Stokers original novel. As already mention the back-story behind Dracula & why he is afraid of the Church makes a lot of sense & between the fights, special effects & one-liners there's some neat ideas & a good story here. I was very surprised at just how much fun Dracula 2000 was & how much I liked it.Director Lussier does a decent job here, all the slick MTV type camera & editing tricks are here & they aren't too intrusive for a change. The fights are pretty cool mixing your standard actor on actor punch up with those Matrix style CGI effects, people twist & turn through the air in slow motion & we follow silver stakes fired from a gun as they shoot through the air towards their target along with other bits of computer trickery. There's some gore here buts it's not that excessive, a few bites, some splashes of blood, a few decapitations including one with a pair of garden shears a scene that looked like it belonged in The Burning (1981), some stabbings & a bit when someone has a leech attach itself to their eye, ouch.With a supposed budget of about $28,000,000 Dracula 2000 has the latest special effects, is extremely well made & has that Hollywood polish about it. The acting was OK considering the silly premise & dialogue, Gerard Butler as Dracula is pretty good.Dracula 2000 sounded really dumb to me & I suppose it was to an extent but it's fun, entertaining & there were ideas & bits'n'pieces here that made watching it worthwhile. Against all expectations I liked it & I definitely thinks it's well worth a watch.

Despite not having Craven at the helm, the film still has that style he is famous for. I was a little taken aback when I saw on IMDb that people hated this film?? I was completely blown away by this seemingly campy film. It wasn't campy at all, in fact just the opposite it appeared to be a big budget retelling of Dracula that worked on every angle.Dracula 2000 begins with Matthew Van Helsing, who is secretly protecting Dracula in an enormous vault, is robbed. The thieves think they are going to find riches beyond their dreams but instead they find a coffin so determined to leave with something they take the coffin. On a place over Lousiana they try to open the coffin and they unleash the infamous Dracula. When Van Helsing discovers Dracula is gone he immediately knows what Dracula is after and leaves for America. His protégé Simon secretly follows him wanting to know what he's doing. Dracula is hunting for Van Helsing's daughter. Van Helsing has been using Dracula's blood for the last century to keep himself alive in order to protect the world from Dracula, so his daughter was born with Dracula's blood inside her. Dracula tracks her down and leaves a wake of vampire conversions in his path, each one determined to serve him and stop anyone trying to stop him. Van Helsing meets his end finally and now Simon is the only one who can stop Dracula from taking Mary Van Helsing. In the final battle Mary will discover once and for all the true identity of Dracula and everything he stands for.Gerard Butler who as of recent has impressed me with performances in Dear Frankie and Phantom of The Opera is stunning as Dracula. Perhaps one of the best performances of the infamous vampire I have ever seen. Despite being a story that's been done to death in numerous different ways and styles, Dracula 2000 finds a fresh new twist in Dracula's origin and Gerard Butler plays it amazingly. He's sultry, dark, evil, emotionless and yet torn up, tormented and someone you can't help feel sorry for. One of the grandest moves by the film makers of Dracula 2000 is to swamp the cast with hot new or up and comers in Hollywood. Colleen Fitzpatrick (aka Vitamin C), Jennifer Esposito, Omar Epps, Sean Patrick Thomas, Danny Masterson, Jeri Ryan, Shane West, Nathan Fillion...just a myriad of low level but hot young actors that all play vampires eventually and do a great job. Then they bring on two much more diversified and perhaps you might say seasoned actors to play the two adversaries Gerard Butler (Dracula) and the amazing Christopher Plummer (Van Helsing) who as of recent tends to play cameo roles and brief appearances but I was pleased to see him in over an hour of the film. With equal amount of horror and action the film was intense and non-stop and not toned down so it was full of blood and gore which is necessary for a film about vampires. The absolutely original and very unique origin story of Dracula makes a whole new spin on the character and I am thrilled about how that played out. The film takes us from a more familiar Dracula locale (Europe...England to be exact) to New Orleans during Mardis Gras, and the locations are brilliantly filmed and work the story perfectly. The film is no brilliant academy award winner but we're not looking for that when you watch Dracula 2000...instead we are looking to be entertained and the film does that completely!!

They acknowledged Bram Stoker's Dracula novel as just a story.  In this movie, they gave Dracula a different origin, unlike Bram Stoker's version.  Although I will not describe it, it better explains why Dracula has an aversion towards Christian holy symbols and artifacts.  I've also heard of (or read) similar stories pertaining to Dracula's origin.Don't get me wrong, the movie is not about his origin.  It's more or less about how a group of thieves unknowingly resurrected Dracula, and once restored, went after a particular woman, Van Helsing's daughter, Mary, to combat his solitude.  Only Van Helsing and his employee (who was actually an antiquities dealer for Van Helsing, despite what the plot summary says) can stop Dracula from reaping his evil/vengeance upon the world and corrupting Mary.Overall, I just loved this movie.  I cannot wait to purchase it.  I gave it a 10 out of 10.If you want to see another great vampire movie of a different sort, try Shadow of the Vampire (2000).  Although different, I found the movie quite intriguing.

Christopher Plummer's role of Van Helsing is the highlight of the film for me, as is the short sequence in which he originally defeats the Count.While the film wasn't quite as good as the original Nosferatu by Murnau, or Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula, it is a fine film and a worthy addition to the vampire canon.

But, even with all that baggage, I was thoroughly impressed with _Dracula 2000_, and I think Stoker himself would have approved.  It may not be the letter of his novel--no film, least of all the overpraised Coppola version, has yet provided that--but it comes closer to capturing its spirit than any of the other versions I've seen.First of all, it has few artistic pretensions  it's a good old-fashioned horror/adventure, with good guys (and gals) trying to save the world.  That alone makes it refreshing, and closer to the modest aims of Stoker's novel.  And it's glorious to finally see Stoker's villain come to the screen as just that--a villain--instead of the lovesick romantic underdog that's been palmed off on us for years.But, more importantly, it delves into the deeper themes and ideas that have made Stoker's novel so timeless  the blood exchange in both book and film acts as a metaphor for heredity, for the inherited taint of evil that each human (but especially, here, Van Helsing and his daughter Mary) must fight against.  The dangers of familial influence and blood inheritance, so significant to Stoker's portrayal of the battle of good vs. evil on an internal level, finally come to the screen.  The intricacies of the family ties (which I won't spoil for those of you who haven't yet seen the film) create a powerful level of the story about the complex forces that make up human personality.  The movie also delves into the provocative question of how people's choices can alter their character--and potentially that of their children.  These themes elevates the movie, like the novel itself, above the level of sheer disposable entertainment.Certainly the decision to set the film in the present day will jar some fans of the novel, who are looking for the Victorian setting we all associate with Dracula, but again, this decision works for the story, reminding us that for all our sophistication, we can't be sure that the old evil creatures of folklore won't sneak up on us out of a dark alley.  This was exactly the sensation Stoker himself worked so hard to create.  In order for his vampire to scare us, we have to believe that he can exist in our world--that he is something relevant to us.  I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but thank heaven for Wes Craven!

I don't think that vampire films should be judged alongside other types of movies; it's just too hard to do a seriously good movie with vampires at its core, especially when recycling the Dracula character. Despite popular opinion, I think Coppola's Dracula is not the definitive Dracula film, but that's neither here nor there.I liked the allusions to other vampire stories. I especially liked the derisive comment that everyone seems to believe is ripped off of Anne Rice. I believe the idea was to contradict Rice's character's assertion that Dracula never existed. It worked in the story's context the characters were well aware of other vampire stories, including Rice's.Gerard Butler is wonderful. The trick with Dracula is to make him alluring without losing the tormented, frightening edge. I believe he accomplished that. The rest of the cast were solid. I didn't like the quotables in the script, those one liners tossed around that smack of cheesy B movies. They only bogged down the actors' performances, so that solid acting became painfully forced and out of place at times.The twist on Dracula's identity was very nice to see in celluloid. It has been played with before in literature (Rice's Memnoch, yes, but even that wasn't very original - there are several older books that give Christ himself vampiric properties), but it is nice to see mythologies merging on film.Altogether, I would recommend this flick to any vampire or horror enthusiast. I think it's definitely worth the ticket price.

For the vampire fan, there is plenty of fun to be had with this movie. References to Bram Stoker's book abound, and the twisting of the Dracula legend offers, if nothing satisfactory, a new look at this old tale. Anne Rice fans will likely enjoy the movie as well. This is a sensitive, loving vampire with hurt feelings who, (like any vampire should) somehow ends up in the French Quarter of New Orleans.

I'd say Craven is improving with age, along with his pick in quality films. 2000 is definitely a re-make horror film, or re-vamp if you wish. Unlike many of its predecessors, this one was more carefully constructed. You can how the screen-team worked their material carefully, taking references from Stoker's original novel and translating them to the new age of Y2K where most horror/thriller films need a Sixth Sense status to simply place. Anyone who's a fan of the original films should be interested. Direct vampiric gothics were definitely somewhat disappointed. I truly couldn't see why? I thought the film was marvelous, definitely a contender for better of the recent horror films. For those who didn't like Blair Witch and didn't enjoy this either are being way too picky. Horror movies have out-done themselves in the last twenty years, it's reached an absolute degree to which no reprieve can be taken - unless the film shows you something already there. Most of them don't. The reason why Dracula 2000 didn't work for most was because of this. It was simply the creative streak, Lossiter's no-exception rule for Scream-like stupidity or Dawson's Creek/Party of Five casting that made this movie entertaining.An intelligent story, well updated without Hollywood-ism nonsense.Horror films are very hard to critique, because most of them are no longer horror films at all.If we all remember that the mid 70's, 80's and 90's films scared the horror industry to death. It collapsed on itself, this movie and others are not collapsing down on it. The sting comes from the constant kicks we get in the head from moronic horror entries like I Know What You-whatever, Disturbing Behavior, Bride of Chucky, and endless straight-to-video releases.With this in mind.

Okay, so he was paid in silver when he betrayed Jesus so he hates silver, he hates the sun because he tried to kill himself at dust...

Finding his target in Van Helsing's daughter Mary Heller, (Justine Waddell) and her friend Lucy Westernman, (Colleen Fitzpatrick) and reveals his intention to her. Racing to stop him, Simon follows the trail of corpses to Dracula and battles to save them both.The Good News This wasn't nearly as bad as it could've been. What is best about the movie is how they decided to break the chains binding the tradition of previous vampire films. Rather than bore us with another retelling of how he was once Prince Vlad, it decides to tie his origin into the biblical account of Jesus Christ's crucifixion. This change really works and adds depth him without challenging the Dracula legend. Deciding to tie Dracula to Judas Iscariot also makes a lot of sense. It helps to explain his hatred of crucifixes and holy water and it helps to explain a vampire's aversion to silver. The new origin really does come to us as a breath of fresh air and originality; a hard thing to accomplish when dealing with the most over-used vampire story of all time. The film's great pace is another big plus, always moving along from one scene to another without much filler in between. The action scenes are pretty good, and do drive the film forward. The slaughter in the town hall is quite nice, and the several scenes in the apartment are also full of suspense. There's a really good ending that features tons of great action scenes and some really drawn-out fighting between the two sides and has a great tide between them. The gore is much better than expected, and there's a lot of blood spilled in the film. There's plenty of neck-biting, tons of silver spikes shot into bodies, scratches all over the bodies, decapitations and plenty of blood spilling out of less-serious wounds. This isn't a bloodbath, but it's enough to satisfy. There's also individually neat scenes, such as an attack on a reporter through a video camera by an unseen attacker or a walk down a hallway flowing with diaphanous curtains, or the scenes of Dracula walking through New Orleans experiencing the new world that ring of individual greatness. And the brides here are about as sexy as they've ever been, and really do give a sensuous presence. This one was a lot better than it could've been.The Bad News There wasn't a whole lot wrong with this. The biggest thing wrong with this is that Dracula doesn't inspire any fear or threat at all. The debonair attitude is completely missing, and the air of respectability and nobility is gone at all. He completely issues none of the past trademarks or style that has made him a great figure, and it's not in the least bit threatening when he's on-screen. There's also some really bad fighting going on, especially in the finale. The wire-fu used in the sequences are incredibly bad and come so unconvincingly that they're downright laughable. The fact that just about every single person in the film towards the end is suddenly able to do it is another big problem, as it's all coming out of nowhere. It's very distracting, and is a detriment to the film. Not everyone will accept the changes made to the legend, but it's still a possible flaw, but there's really not a lot more to this than can affect it.The Final Verdict There are some problems with the film but there's still a lot of things about it that do work for it. It's by no means a perfect vampire film, but there's a lot to like about it as well, so if you're interested in the genre or the teen drama films from around the same time, give it a shot.Rated R Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and a brief sex scene "},{"Title":"Wish it was better","Date":"22 December 2005","Score":"4 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Dracula 2000 is a modern day vampire story.

Mind you, Highlander Endgame scenarist Joel Soisson and Lussier have done a good job of adapting the novel to a contemporary setting with the characters while retaining most of the flavor of Stoker's vintage novel. This modern-day update of the classic novel provides Dracula with a provocative back story like none you've ever heard of before in the hundred years plus history of the infamous fangster. The complicated task of reviewing Dracula 2000 is not to divulge important plot points in a story synopsis. Most of the traditional characters return, though some are slighted in the process. Aside from Dracula, Van Helsing is back and so is Dr. Seward, but Seward gets the short shrift. Indeed, he appears in only one scene before the vampires sort him out of the action. As it turns out, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer of The Sound of Music) is a man with a deep, dark secret, and he now operates the Carfax Abbey as a museum. When Dracula immigrated to England, he chose Carfax Abbey as his destination where he would reside. A hundred years later after he vanquished Dracula, Van Helsing has transformed Dracula's creepy, old living quarters into the centerpiece of his museum. He has imprisoned Dracula's body in a silver coffin, concealed him from the public exhibition, and locked him up in a vault, with guards and a sophisticated security system. Assisting Van Helsing is Simon Sheppard (Jonny Lee Miller of Trainspotting) who acquires antiques, like a heavy wooden crossbow. Simon has no clue about Van Helsing's secret. He believes that Van Helsing is a descendant of the latter's vampire slaying father. We the audience learn before Simon does that everything is not as it appears. Future superstar actor Gerard Butler stars as Dracula. Slim and trim without all those muscles that he bulked himself up with, the handsome Butler looks nothing like Bela Lugosi. One of the in-jokes occurs when he arrives in New Orleans in search of Van Helsing's daughter, and she offers him coffee. Butler alters Lugosi's famous line I don't drink . . . coffee. Draped in black with shoulder-length hair, Butler is more seductive than sinister.Meantime, Van Helsing's secretary, known only as Solina (Jennifer Esposito of Crash), violates his trust. Primarily, she believes that Van Helsing's state-of-the-art security system must be shielding gold, jewelry, paintings, and other valuables that merit such a security system. She arranges for a gang of thieves to break into the Carfax Museum and loot the place. The apparent leader of the gang, Marcus (Omar Epps of Higher Learning) is considerably distressed when all that he finds are ancient skulls and a silver casket. Solina is equally incredulous until they find that coffin. Suddenly, two members of their seven member gang die horribly when they trigger booby traps. Eddie (Lochlyn Munro of Dead Man on Campus) is impaled on spears that plunge from the ceiling as he pushes the coffin away, while Dax (Tig Fong of Silent Hill) is skewered by a swinging trellis of spears. Naturally, this action sets off an alarm that prompts Van Helsing to load up his single-shot pistol with the longest silver bullets that you've ever. By the time that Van Helsing enters the vault and reaching the place where he had imprisoned Dracula, he finds nobody. Marcus, Solina, Nightshade (Danny Masterson of Face/Off), Trick (Sean Patrick Thomas of Save the Last Dance) and Charlie (Tony Munch of Cube Zero) blast their way of underground part of Carfax and take the coffin with them as they escape by means of a tunnel. Marcus and company load the coffin onto a plane and fly to New Orleans where the plane crashes because Dracula escapes from captivity. The aircraft falls out of the sky into Bayou Celeste, and local TV news reporter Valerie Sharp (Jeri Ryan of Down with Love) covers the aerial tragedy that leaves five people dead. Of course, nobody is dead because Dracula (Gerard Butler of 300) has turned them into vampires. He hits the streets of New Orleans in search of Van Helsing's estranged daughter, Mary Heller-Van Helsing (Justine Waddell of Mansfield Park), who he hasn't seen in twelve years. Mary has been having hallucinations about a stranger in her life. Little does she know that that stranger is none other than Dracula himself. Not only does Van Helsing arrive in the Crescent City, but his partner, Simon Sheppard (Jonny Lee Miller of The Beach), shows up to help him locate Mary. Unfortunately, Van Helsing doesn't survive long after he encounters Dracula. Meantime, three of his vampire women go after Mary, but she eludes death at their hands and confronts Dracula in a high-octane finale.Eventually, we learn Dracula is Judas Iscariot of Biblical fame. The villain of all vampires abhors silver because he sold Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. He attempts to commit suicide, but the rope snapped. Now, he roams the earth because the thieves that broke into the Carfax Museum thought they were going to find wealth that they didn't find. Furthermore, Van Helsing has been using leeches to filter Dracula's blood so that he won't die. He administers regular injections to himself so he will stay alive. Imagine the complications that ensue when his wife discovers what Van Helsing has done and leaves him, taking their daughter with her to escape his insanity? Not surprisingly, when Dracula gets loose, he confront his mortal enemy and searches for his daughter. Director Patrick Lussier ladles out blood and gore galore, and New Orleans looks appropriately Gothic as the setting. Dracula doesn't exactly meet his maker in the end, but his demise is incandescent. Nevertheless, Lussier brought back this monster for two sequels. Butler sat out Dracula II Ascension and Dracula III Legacy where Rutger Hauer took over the role.

I can say that it made me watch it because of the cast. This is 2000, before Butler was King Leonidas in 300, before Nate Fillion was doing Serenity, before Christopher Plummer was...wait a second, what the hell is Chris Plummer doing in this film? What the heck? It's something to behold, this one. It inspired me to write this review for golly sake. Gerard butler spends most of the movie casting his dreamy eyes despairingly over the unfortunate people who find themselves in his lustful way. His hair blows and frills in the breeze and I swear I can see the product glistening throughout his beautiful locks. Oh yeah, he's Judas in this one. Dracula is Judas.t This is just a terrible movie. But I watched it in its entirety so what does that say? It's actually amazing to know that they somehow made this film. It's so 2000. In every hilarious, campy, cliché ridden way. It's fun to watch, I have to say....some of the stuff you will see will have your jaw agape in amazement...utter amazement for the fact this movie exists. And these actors were in it. Johnny Lee Miller what the hell are you doing in this? Working on your bag of terrible accents? I guess when Dracula is being hung he suddenly can't fly anymore? Huh? He loses his powers or something? And then the sun comes out and burns him alive. Really though, these ideas in this are actually pretty cool. It's a neat idea to have a twist like having Draco be Judas Iscariot. Then the credits rolled and Linkin Park came on and then Disturbed and I was like, man, music really sucked that year. But this movie is that crappy music, it's a horrible movie. It's everything I hate about that music. Come to think of it, it's really the visual equivalent of that total pile of dog poo music genre. But because it's this bad it has a place in my heart. Put this in the 2000 time capsule.

Well, watched this film tonight (13th August 2008). I have always been a horror fan, but the last 20 years or so have left me feeling horror has nothing more to offer. The same premise is given a modern interpretation with, usually an attempt at a new twist. Often the twists are tenuous at best and transporting horror from a dark and dismal past to a light and modern setting (and then trying to darken it a bit) doesn't do it for me. Since the 'Freddy' Nightmare series, there has been little new that has re-fuelled my love of horror. And even that got stale with the repeated sequels losing all originality. I have avoided this film with the disdain of a jaded ex-horror fan determined I knew it would be the same old story, moved forward to make it contemporary and appealing to a modern audience. But tonight, nothing else on, no work tomorrow, and refusing to have an early night if Idon't have to get up I took the plunge and was somewhat surprised. The beginning of the film lead me to believe it was going to be the usual rubbish, retelling what is actually a very good story in its original form but removing all its Gothic suspense and attraction in a modern retelling. However, the idea that the original Dracula was Judas Iscariot was innovative. Such a pity they mixed up, as many horror films do, the idea that silver kills vampires. We all know it only works against werewolves. Still, I enjoyed the way it was interwoven into the vampire legend. I have to say; though I found the film entertaining it still didn't hit the mark. I still dislike Gothic horrors transported to the modern era. They just don't work for me. (I must take a look at 'Dracula 3000 &#x96; Infinite Darkness'. But I don't think it will make me sit up and take notice.) Now, take Bram Stokers original work, weave the silver and Judas idea into it and do it well and you might find a blockbuster on your hands. Though the idea will now be second hand and will lose some of its effect by not being original. If you like horror and you don't mind modern I think you'll enjoy it. If you're an old fart, like me and live in the past (!) you'll miss the dingy, gas lit atmosphere that gives horror its mystical 'reality'. But then, it couldn't be called 'Dracula 2000' &#x96; or could it?

I loved the idea that Dracula was Judas, it was kinda new.I was particularly impressed by Gerard Butler, he created a new Dracula. He was not handsome, he was seductively beautiful. When my friends were discussing this movie, with Gerard Butler as Dracula, I never even thought of considering watching the movie. I would've simply change to Interview with the Vampire or Van Helsing. Of course, Dracula 2000 cannot compare to Van Helsing, but it's good anyway.I recommend this movie to most vampire movie and literature lovers.

It's more likely, however, that they just pulled it out of their asses.In conclusion, it's not all that bad... but at the same time I wouldn't spend any money on it.

It would need to be done very well though as unfortunately, I just don't think today's setting works anywhere near as well as the less technological times of the original tale. But Patrick Lussier decided he was going to give it a real good go and bring The Count into the year 2000, along with all the sex, drugs and rock and roll that permeate this age.The story has Dracula locked away in his coffin by Van Helsing, whom has kept himself alive for 100s of years by injecting himself with the immortal vampire's blood. He has dedicated his borrowed eternity to try to destroy the seemingly un-killable Dracula. But obviously (otherwise the movie would be rather bland), Dracula is about to escape captivity and enter the world as it exists in the new millennium. Is it worth your time? Well that depends on what you're looking for really.If you're hunting for a really good movie then well, this isn't a very sensible place to be looking. The acting is average at best. The dialogue is corny and filled with unrealistic reactions. The script tries to be really clever with the whole Judas thing but it's not terribly convincing. The action is a strange mix of Matrix style wire-works and almost laughable Gothic visuals. All in all, the Academy wasn't staying up late considering whether Dracula 2000 deserved any nominations.If you're looking for a dark horror movie, then you'll most likely be disappointed also. Apart from an occasional smattering of blood, there really isn't anything particularly scary or gory about this film. The very few scares that occur are terribly telegraphed and the vampires are trying really hard to be either sexy or funny. Neither of which gets the hair up on the back of your neck.But, if you're really into the whole Scream thing and prefer your horror movies to be filled with teenagers, sex, comedy and heavy metal, then this could be a fun night in with a couple of friends. If you even remotely enjoyed Queen of the Damned or Cursed, then this will be right up your alley. From what I have read in the reviews here, women seem to find Gerard Butler as Dracula to be insanely sexy. Although I can't vouch for that due to my inherent maleness, I did find him to be acceptable, if not very comfortable, in the role.Personally, I prefer my horror movies to be filled with actual horror rather than the above teenage excesses that have seemingly become the norm for the darker side of theater these days. But I can't deny that this was at least entertaining and so I'll give it 5 out of 10 for that.

I'd heard all sorts of terrible reviews--and indeed, I only watched it because of Gerard Butler. I suppose I was expecting either some suspense, or something of mythic lameness (coined a new phrase there...you just watch!). Instead, I found something very strange.First off, I have to say that Dracula 2000 is not in any way frightening, not even for a moment. I'm a terrible chicken when it comes to horror films that I can hardly stand watching many of them, but this movie never even made me think about flinching. In the commentary they go on about things being scares, but they're really just...not. I don't know what the deal is with that. You'd think they could at least surprise you into being startled, but no.For all that, though, Dracula 2000 is oddly alluring, not least because of Dracula himself. Yes, he is gorgeous. No, I will not gush. I would say that Mr. Butler plays Dracula as very mysterious and scary, but he really mostly looks bemused in many scenes. Who can blame him, though? The character has missed a century, and here he is in the middle of Mardi Gras.The actors did a good job with what they had, and the dialog isn't bad. The action was as well-done as could be expected given time and budget restraints, though as with all effects using cables to make people fly around there were moments when it didn't really work. The bit where Spunkula (sorry...Dracula...) turns into a wolf is rendered just plain silly by the way it's done. With the rest of the film filled with all sorts of effects shots, to have that one transformation done by cutting back and forth between Gerard Butler and a wolf really fast is distractingly campy. It really doesn't help that the wolf they got looks old and confused, either.Dracula's new back story was creative, to say the least. It did add a dimension to the film without which it would have been just too inane. I'm not going to go into terribly much detail there, since I'm sure it's already been discussed to death.My suggestion to you is to stop viewing this as a horror film and re-watch it, thinking of it this time as a comedy. While it's true that if this had been their aim they ought to have upped the camp just a bit more and left in a lot of the scenes you'll find in the extras on the DVD, it's still enjoyable in this fashion. When that blood splatters across the inside of the plane, go ahead and laugh. It's cheesy. It's silly. It's great fun.Ah, and keep your ears open in the scene in which Van Helsing is mucking about with the leeches. The music he puts on the record player is the fourth movement of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, March to the Scaffold, though the first few seconds are skipped. Wonderfully morbid choice, and I'd highly recommend going out and listening to the whole thing.

Unfortunately, the writers really don't use this twist to its full advantage. On one hand, it adds new depth to Dracula, but the other hand, it doesn't really do much for the character at hand. The movie just uses this as a simple, clear-cut motivation - This is why I'm evil. They don't really explore this principal, which has the potiential to be fascinating, if done right.The cast is actually well-done, boasting both solid actors like Christopher Plummer and Gerald Butler, but at the same time throwing in recognizable sci-fi faces like Jonny Lee Miller (Hackers) and Jeri Ryan (Star Trek Voyager). Another problem is this movie is bascially a typical horror movies with characters moving too quickly for us to care either about their personality or their safety, striking all the wrong notes along the way. They flee the monsters by running AWAY from the crowded Flordia streets, seeking shelter deep within the isolated woods, and even, at one point, within a cemetary crypt! Wes Craven, producer of the movie, shook up the horror genre with Scream, but this movie falls into the paper-thin plot holes that latter brilliantly criticized.Potiential SpoilerThere is one final note I'd like to about the Biblical identity of Dracula. This isn't the first work to tie vampires into Judeo- Christian lore. I've seen fallen angels are vampires, the Mark of Cain as vampires as well as the kin of Lilith as vampires. Standing alone, as this plot twist does, it achieves little for the story other than a good reaccounting of the original Biblical story. I think shouldn't have been a plot twist. It should have been presented to us in the beginning, or in media res, and spent the subsequent ninety-nine minutes upon the development of this idea, rather than merely declaring this notion to be brilliant.

It also has a cast of hotties to make it easy on the eyes -- Jennifer Esposito and Jeri Ryan slinking around in evening gowns is always a plus, and the ladies can dig Gerard Butler as the dark-and-sexy Prince of the Undead.It suffers from a number of the cliches that plague most vampire movies (including the necessary half-wits who don't know enough not to open a spooky coffin and thus start the movie) but it gives just enough interesting new ideas to the Dracula mythology to keep you wondering what's going to happen next. The origin of Dracula, revealed at the end -- and how it ties in with traditional vampiric weaknesses -- is particularly clever.All in all, if you dig dopey vampire flicks with a hot, hip young cast, this should be an enjoyable couple hours.

It all hangs together pretty well, I thought. The main characters are generally pretty likeable, too.Still, why do they always cast the ugliest woman as the heroine?

Some movies that has made it work is Bram Stokers Dracula and the first Blade movie, each in a very different way. It seems the most important thing is to find good and charismatic actors for the main cast. That is where this movie fails first and foremost. The plot is thin, but ok (and not new). The SFX are good enough, and the idea of a modern vampire hunting Van Helsing is cool and could possibly deserve some exploration in its own right. However Gerard Butler just doesn't do it for me as Dracula and his acting, although not terrible is nowhere near good either. Justine Waddell is not very good either and I get no feel for her character. It's good to see an old gent like Christopher Plummer again, although he doesn't get much to work with here. Now, I'll admit that the characters doesn't have to be deep and emotional for me to enjoy the movie. I loved Woods character in Carpenters Vampires, although the movie is not a good one. But in this movie they play up on moody scenes with emotionally tormented characters that just doesn't work. And it's not a happy-go-killing movie like Carpenters either.

Wes Craven understudy Patrick Lussier sits in the director's chair for this flick and delivers enough eye candy (Vitamin C topless -- SCORE!) to keep our eyes open. However, the plot is full of holes, the action scenes are contrived ('Matrix' anyone?) and the gore gets downright tasteless (and this coming from a horror fan!). The story goes something like this A group of thieves steal Dracula's tomb mistaking it for treasure. When a member accidentally opens it, Dracula awakes from a thousand year (I think) slumber. Dracula makes his way to the states to infect some people, kill his niece (again, not so clear on this one) and stops off for a bit to celebrate Mardi Gras and listen to heavy metal music. Oh, did I mention Dracula's favorite music store is Virgin records? If you pay too much attention to the movie, you will literally be bored and/or confused to death.

I mean it's irritating when a film has constant lingering shot of the Virgin Megastores logo and has numerous scenes take place in a branch when the fact that Mary works there does nothing to advance the plot.Another irritation was that the Dracula in this film isn't the slightest bit appealing, he's not particularly good looking and the actor isn't generally very seductive. This makes the fact that all the women in the film are drawn to him kinda hard to accept. I also didn't know why it was only women who are drawn to him unless this was just to make women out to be stupid and less rational compared to the men which would be bad not to mention sexist.The acting was also intermittently just awful! Justine Waddell was paticularly atrocious the most grating scene being the church one which isn't good considering she's the main character. I mean the accent was just unbelievably posh and surely put on, at least I hope so cause I wouldn't think it possible for someone to be so rigid naturally!That said some actors I found myself liking because they seemed to have the right idea, Omar Epps for instance is having the time of his life and so subsequently is bearable but a lot of the actors like Jonny Lee Miller, are too serious and not aware that they aren't acting out a good screenplay which is irritating to watch.

The story is largely devoid of any anticipation of horror.  There is too much focus on technology. The director relies almost completely on music and sound effects to compensate for creative visualizations and imagination. Dracula is too superhuman, and he is developed indistinctly at best. He never becomes a truly focused entity. The director, probably to compensate for everything else he missed, stocked this turkey with some very beautiful women.

It's hard to imagine why Dr. Van Helsing is in the story at all.  He has absolutely ZERO effect on the plot, none whatsoever.  And the interesting idea of linking Dracula with leeches is completely dropped.                                                                               DRACULA 2000 isn't so much better than I was expecting as having virtues in areas I didn't expect, and being bad in radically different ways than I expected.  It's far from a good movie, but there are some interesting elements, some real intelligence at work.  Too bad so many compromises were made in order to turn the film into something that 15-year-old boys -- and hardly anyone older -- really got off on.  Nothing wrong with 15-year-old boys, but I wish someone would make a vampire movie for people over 20, a vampire movie written by someone who's never HEARD of Anne Rice.

Dracula 2000 has a cheesy title, a boring, stupid and fairly unsuccessful teen-pop star(Vitamin C) in a role which seems to have been designed for her to be seen topless, no suspense and stupid actions scenes. The fact that, to make Dracula seem like a tougher foe, the legendary vampire seems to react to none of the traditional anti-vampire products makes it even less fun. What makes this movie almost worth thinking for a few seconds before saying oh it's boring anyway is a surprisingly clever twist on Dracula's origin. But since the rest of the movie is pure garbage, you should avoid it anyway, except if you simply need to see every vampire movie ever made. If you want a good vampire movie, see 1992's Dracula or Interview with the Vampire. And, one last thing... Why is this movie such a shameless add for Virgin Records?

Most horror movies are B-Movies, and are happily so. The problem with 'Dracula 2000' is that it's a B-Movie trying to pretend it's an A-Movie and it fails miserably.Almost everything about this movie could stand improvement the acting, the special effects, even the sound editing! Gerald Butler (Dracula) relies too much on slow speech with heavy breathing, in effect screaming HEY! I'm EVIL!, without allowing for any facets of the character to show. Jeri Ryan is basically in the picture to say Look! Boobs! Hot Women! and serves zero purpose, only helping to drag along this already boring picture. The whole troupe of vampires seems to forget that in a movie, you 'act', and rely too much on the fangs and the heavy breathing to get through scenes. And the cliched red eyes? Not scary. Looked more disgusting; like pinkeye.Even for a horror film, where the characters are not meant to be the most important part, 'Dracula 2000' falls short of the mark. Far short. Characters are introduced and when the movie is over, we still don't understand why they were really there. Frankly, in a movie where there are three, maybe four necessary characters, you need to look and say Hey! Maybe this script is crap!.There are not any scary moments in the film either. It's as if you can almost hear the director sitting next to you, saying, be scared...now when some red eyes show up, or a vampiress is behaving sexually, or when Dracula first escapes. Frankly, there is one scary moment in the film, and it lasts for about three seconds and involves *none* of the above.To top it off, we get Richard Branson (is that his name?) shoved in our faces shamelessly. Try and count how many times a 'Virgin' logo is shown prominently on the screen.Summing up, 'Dracula 2000' basically fails in every department it sets out in. It's not scary, the women are not titillating (unfortunately I don't know many guys, including myself, who find women who have strange oozing red eyes to be attractive), and the characters aren't even involving enough to make you hate them. You just shrug and say, Who cares?.As a side note, don't even bother renting it. The sound editing is so bad it's almost impossible to understand anything. The dialogue is so quiet that you are forced to crank up any television, new or old, to understand what they are saying and then, suddenly, something will explode loudly on screen, also causing your speakers and eardrums to explode. Pitifully, those moments of 'loudness' were probably the scariest in the movie.Negative Five Stars STAY AWAY!!!

The movie kind of distances itself from the work by Bram Stoker, the only elements retained were the Death Ship, Carfax Abby, the Character of Van Helsing, and, of course, Dracula.Now as you may have already guessed, my main reason in watching this movie was because Christopher Plummer was in it. And the fact that he was cast as Dr. Van Helsing was not only very enjoyable, but inspired casting. Most of the reviews have given kudos to Gerald Butler, So I figured I would send some kudos to Plummer.MAJOR SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I do have one major gripe. Why was Van Helsing killed off? In the movie, when Dracula threw him into the mirror, I sat on the edge of my seat for the next five minutes(Something that doesn't happen to often, and for those of you who have seen some of the more recent horror movies, you know what I mean) and when they showed him impaled under the bed, I was VERY disappointed! I know Van Helsing was about a hundred and fifty years old, and he's been guarding Dracula all that time and yes, that has to wear a guy out. But COME ON! The makers of this film have the the talents of one of the greatest actors of our time, and they don't give him enough time on screen. Besides that, killing off Van Helsing was like killing off Captain Kirk In the Star Trek Series. To the makers of this movie If there is a sequel in the works, BRING BACK VAN HELSING!!! I don't care how. Black Magic, a time machine, hell, get some of his blood (Hey, there was some left on his neck) and clone him!

High tech crooks break into an art museum, and steal the wrong piece of art....the coffin of Dracula. The Undead One escapes and converts the crooks into vampires. It's up to Matthew Van Helsing, an antiques dealer and long a foe of Dracula to stop him...with the aid of a protege of his. He travels to New Orleans to save his estranged daughter, having visions of Dracula, who is steadfast coming toward her...with the aid of people he is turning in to the undead.This film had promise. A strong cast, a good story, and sleek visuals. So what went wrong? Everything. It's like the straight to tape film that accidentally got a theatrical release. The editing is off putting due to constant quick cuts of conversation. The direction and dialogue is off at times, which downgrades what wasn't a bad atmospheric style. Omar Epps essentially reprises his role from the worthless Breakfast of Champions, to play a spastic thief-turned-vampire. He ends up darting around like a cartoon character hopped up on LSD and acid, which is the last role you'd expect him to play. The film's class is provided by Christopher Plummer, a great actor tragically brought down by bad scriptwriting, and an unreasonably short end. Also, how much more product placement can you have when you constantly see a Virgin Megastore. The characters are essentially one punch, one dimensional people that are just there, but don't provide any real weight. They don't have much of a tie to the film. Oddly enough, a billed Lochlyn Munro (well cast as the dumb as nails jock in Scary Movie and the psychotic fratboy from Dead Man On Campus) is in the film for about five minutes before suffering an unruly fate. The potential this film could've reached would be monumental, too bad it's brought down to being B-movie status, it's a real disappointment with a fairly good cast.

However, the spell was broken when he began to speak at length (earlier one-liners, like We are all so much more complicated than our names, are fine).  Butler, unfortunately, has a weak chin and a bit of baby-fat in his cheeks, and the lisp from the fangs doesn't help when he's trying to deliver speeches and explanations while still maintaining the Mr. Sexy Man image.  This one thing interfered so insanely while I was watching the movie that it became all I could think about, to the point that the final fifteen minutes that Butler was onscreen were lost to me.  I was too busy wishing the lower half of his face would stop moving!This kind of thing is no one's fault, to be sure, although I wish I wasn't the only one to notice it.

The movie is a roller coaster, not of spiraling and ever deepening horror, but of good and bad movie making.  At one moment it hops along, raising the viewers expectations--even impressing him from time to time, and then takes abrupt plummets into the ridiculous, ludicrous and other wise dumb.  This, with no transition time in the process makes for a very weird movie-watching experience. There are moments, particularly when the movie parallels the older legend of Dracula (the wicked vampire ladies are well done) and when it creates its own vampire mythology and when Dracula is reacting to the new world that the movie shines at its brightest. Some of the vampire hunting scenes wiggle back and forth between inconsistent, bad and overblown. The exceptions to this I can think of are the well thought out encasement of Dracula at the beginning, and the clever trap Van Helsing sprung to capture him in the first place. The new origin provided for Dracula is intriguing and reasonable, but somehow lacked in presentation.  I do think the Virgin Record Store shirt on all the ladies was a trifle over-clever.  More eye-rolling than chuckling kind of humor. The acting all around was consistent, as were the special effects, so no complaints in those departments.  I think the biggest problem with the movie is they did not know whether the were taking themselves seriously or  humorously and the transitions between the two are abrupt and lacking in timing.

Jump scares work for serial killer movies, like Friday the 13th, or Scream.  Jump scares rely heavily on loud glaring sounds when you do not expect them, and objects suddenly popping onto the screen.  When these happen, most people jump, hence the name. These however do not leave you with any feeling of dread, no spine-tingling fear, nothing like that, because as soon as the jump scare is over........thats pretty much all there is.Lately directors seem to be overusing jump scares.  What Lies Beneath comes to mind.  This movie was creepy without all of the jump scares, and yet it was filled with these scares, filled to the point where a second watching of the film is not nearly as scary as the first.Keep that information aside for a bit, and let me tell ya'll about vampire movies.  Vampire movies should NOT rely on jump scares, they should not pretend to be truly scary.  Vampirism is romanticised by novels and films (not to mention all those goth kids) today.  When Lugosi did Dracula, it was considered scary, and still is today (well maybe only to three year olds). Today we have movies like Blade and John Carpenters Vampires which try to monopolize on the fact that vampires are no more scary than any other bad guy in an action film.  Then there are films like Bram Stokers Dracula, which wholeheartedly admit that the vampire subgenre of horror films are little more than eye candy, interesting folklore, and lots of homoerotic (and other erotic) imagery.So my point here  This film took the tired out jump scare routine, and integrated it with an other wise wonderful vampire movie that truly puts a new spin on the dracula legend (although it comes off as sounding too much like all the horrible Y2K movies of recent years like end of days, or Lost souls).  And the result  a cheap schlock fest.There were so many scenes here that were fantastically done though, and I cannot ignore them.  Most notably, Mary's Red Hallway scene and the most beautiful vampire chicks this genre has seen in years.The good scenes do out weigh the bad jump scares, but when you look back on it, there seem to be way too many of these jump scares here, and this is a problem, and will be a problem for anyone who thinks they're going to see a great vampire movie....forget it, this one is closer to Scream than anything else.one final note, it came as a complete shock to me to see Colleen Fitzpatrick, who I knew as Amber from Hairspray, and then to find out she's actually Vitamin C.....but she mastered the role of vampire bride, not that its very difficult to look sexy with fangs and a tight dress.

Unfortunately, it was out of disbelief at how shallow and lifeless this movie was.  The sometimes-pretty retelling is an insult rather than an homage, with a lack-luster cast caught knee-deep in purple blood, incessant lame humor, and a shockingly antithetical plot `twist' that is far more embarrassing than it is revolutionary.The only redeeming aspect of the film is a luscious Gerald Butler as The Vamp himself.  Sadly, he has nothing to do but stand around and look pretty (something he excels at, by the way) while teen idols prance around self-righteously baring illbegotten fangs and hammering stakes into one another.  In `Dracula 2000' Dracula has fewer lines than the leeches that suck on him (lucky devils).The plot, if there was one, was promising at first.  Revived and raring to go, Count Lascivious--I mean Dracula--is pursued by the aging Van Helsing and a poster-boy sidekick as he seeks out his psychic soulmate Mary in turn-of-the-millenium New Orleans.  Along the way he picks up a few dates and apparently buys them matching outfits.  But halfway through you begin to realize that you already saw this movie-when it was called `End of Days'-and you still can't understand why she's running away from the succulent, supernatural, raven-haired Casanova into the arms of a tepid underwear model with a big gun.At best, this is eye candy, and it manages to squander its best chances at being even that.  Butler, an irresistibly smoldering Dracula-as-rock-star, is reduced to a sappy, underdeveloped, non-threatening supporting player and Jeri Ryan as his most interesting concubine takes a backseat to the lukewarm Colleen Fitzpatrick.  The writing and acting have nothing to recommend them either (one starts to believe that Christopher Plummer situated himself under that bed to cease the humiliation), and the soundtrack ignores the gothic, century-straddling romance in favor of slasher-film death metal. Your time would be better spent writing your own Stoker rip-off as it will inevitably be better than this one--as long as it has at least one scene with a black-clad Gerry Butler half-obscured in dry ice fog purring `I will be with you forever.'

You have heroine 'Mary' who works for 'Virgin' records whose life is saved by someone named Simon 'Shepard'.  Figuring out Dracula's secret identity was about as subtle as finding out that Clark Kent is Superman.  (I won't spoil it by revealing his name, but lets just say the 'writing is on the wall'.)  Since this film was obviously lacking the quintessential elements to construct a successful film (i.e. good-actors, good script, good dialogue...) I thought it would at least titilate you with some of the more guilty pleasures of shlock horror.  Nope.  It fails in this too.  The gore is almost non-existent...and for you T&A hounds...well, look elsewhere.  (Did Jeri Ryan even have a purpose in this film?) The means used to defeat Dracula was lifted directly from Friday the 13th VI.  (He has to be killed in the manner in which he originally died.) So I can't really give it points for originality.

Dracula is supposed to be a very sexy and seductive creature.  While the movie did try to use this aspect with the inclusion of three attractive female vampires, it still didn't have the seductive punch that it should have.  And all of the other vampires besides Dracula uttered some pretty ridiculous one liners that are all too common in todays Horror Movies.  The special effects were decent, but nothing spectacular.  I think that they should have also shown Dracula interacting with the modern world more, since that was a more interesting part of the movie.  This was a half hearted attempt at a vampire movie that people will still go and see and think it is good because they don't know any better.  Hollywood needs to stop producing this kind of crap.

Right out of gate the movie opened with an intro that (to my knowledge) had little to do with the rest of the movie.  Dracula 2000 takes a rather interesting approach on the legendary story on how Dracula came to be.  Yet, we never really see how this is tied in.  Subtle references are thrown at the audience so briefly that its hard to understand even if you've seen the movie more than once. All in all the plot could have been a lot better and it's really amazing that Wes Craven would go along with something like this.Movies based off a classic story and then placed in a futuristic setting normally just don't work.  This is no exception.  While trying to appeal to a less educated audience, Dracula 2000 throws heavy amounts of music and Matrix style fight scenes at us like there's no tomorrow.  While some of the action scenes are fairly interesting, they are just not enough to drown out the mess that is the plot.On a high note the soundtrack is awesome; featuring tracks from Linkin Park, Hed PE, and Godsmack it really livens up some of the action.  I just have one question... how was Virgin able to come up with the money to pay for the absurd amount of advertising in this movie.  There is literally not one scene in which their logo is not there.In conclusion, if you are a guy looking to take your date to a movie that will get them jumping in your arms so you can play hero... then this is the one.

Every single frame of Dracula 2000 is wrong in some way, and the movie is too busy trying to be clever and self-reflexive that it forgets about being entertaining.Over the course of the film the on-screen action makes it very clear that these people really could have made a better movie but decided their target audience was too stupid for that.  We know the filmmakers are familiar with the classic vampire movies because of all the blatant references to Nosferatu, to the 1931 Lugosi movie, even to Coppola's more recent Bram Stoker's Dracula.  But Dracula 2000 never even reaches for the elegant sensuality of those films--it just hits us over the head with loud music and gore and ludicrous cleavage.  At times, it seems like the film is trying to make us more stupid as we watch it.The twist that the screenplay presents (you'll know it when you see it) is also highly questionable.  Dracula 2000 is just too stupid a movie to make something like that work.  A smarter vampire movie with the same basic idea could have actually said something about faith or loyalty or some other relevant topic, but again this movie is too busy giving us jarring sounds and illogical special effects to pull it off.

But that's really about it.The fight scenes were stolen from Blade.  Butler's portrayal of Dracula ranged from the Dracula of Gary Oldman, Bela Lugosi, and Christopher Lee but smacked mostly of Thomas Ian Griffith's Valek from John Carpenter's Vampires.  Much of the cinematography involving the vampiric forms of Ryan, Fitzpatrick, and the suspiciously Jennifer-Lopez-like Jennifer Esposito relied heavily on tricks used in Francis Ford Coppola's edition of Bram Stoker's Dracula.  And of course, much of the story of D2K takes place in New Orleans -- a nod to Anne Rice's acclaimed series of vampire novels.Even attempts at subtlety become glaringly obvious amid the flood of corporate sponsorship.  The female lead, played by the paranoid Justine Waddell, is named Mary.  She works at the Virgin record store.  PLEASE tell me that wasn't the best that writer/producer Joel Soisson could think of! I expect something like that out of a middle-school theater prospect, not a professional.Whether D2K was trying to pay tribute to previous vampire movies or stand on its own as a legitimate film, I don't know.  If paying tribute, it did so in a halting, haphazard way as if Soisson came up with more ideas in the middle of the night and decided to simply throw them together.  If attempting to stand on its own as a legitimate contender among vampire movies, it fails.The only piece of originality in D2K is its own hypothesis of the origins of vampirism -- which bucks any and all quasi-historical accounts of vampirism.  Pretty daring for the lame member of the herd.As far as vampire movies go, I am thoroughly convinced that I should avoid films whose titles contain the word Dracula and a year (witness the other lame-duck pop-culture wannabe Dracula A.D. 1972 unfortunately starring the acclaimed Christopher Lee).

The acting was generally well-done, the dialogue was good, and the special effects fit the movie, neither poorly done nor overblown.  The only problem I had was with them throwing Jeri Ryan (of Star Trek  Voyager fame) into the movie as one of the 3 vampires in Dracula's new harem.  The other 2 such vampires were related (plot-wise, not blood-wise) to the main characters in some way while her character just seemed to be thrown in for her cleavage (funnily enough her character pretty much acknowledges as the extent of her talent as a news reporter).  That is not to say that the other two didn't serve that purpose as well but at least they were somehow related to plot--Jeri Ryan's character could have been completely removed with no problem whatsoever.

I have always enjoyed vampire films and the mythos of the undead, in general, but I never particularly cared for the concept of Dracula, the super-vampire. Yet, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Now, let me tell you why. This was a complete over-haul of the Dracula story. It had all of the bloodsucking gore and ultra violence typical of modern horror movies, but, without delving into the plot too much for fear of spoiling the great concept which is revealed, I will say it is the most clever concept I have seen or read dealing with the origins of the nosferatu, putting Dracula at the start of it all, explaining where HE came from, as well. The writer of this script has completely thrown out the ramblings of that drunken irish madman (Bram Stoker) in favor of a story which utilizes even older vampire mythology.  Specifically, I speak of The Vampire and His Kith and Kin which is a much older work and actually considered to be non-fiction in that it doesn't tell a fluid story but instead collects old folk tales about the nature of vampires dating back to their origins in the middle ages. Ideas from this are clearly used, and used well, I might add. Beheading and the use of silver as means to dispatch a bloodsucker are two themes you rarely see in recent vampire films and are taken directly from the old myths. And what is clever about the film is how they don't stop with the inclusion of these concepts but take it even a step further by explaining, not only why these things work, but in the process, where Dracula comes from, and more specifically, WHO he actually is. Yes, folks, that's right, there's a mystery afoot! The casting and acting of the film was well done also, although from the appearance of the actor playing the title character, one almost expects that this was originally meant to be an Antonio Banderas vehicle.

I don't like films of this type generally, with all these fantasy monsters and whatnot, but I actually thought this one wasn't extremely horrible. It was far from a great movie, but for the type of movie that it is, it was watchable and had some good stuff to offer.Dracula 2000 is about Dracula himself, who is awaken from the dead when some thieves steal his casket at an underground security safe in London. The coffin (which they think contains treasures and gold and such) is put on a plane where the thieves try to pry it open, and when they do, Dracula is unleashed. As one would imagine, he kills off everyone on the plane, turning them into the living dead. Meanwhile, Mary, a young woman living in New Orleans, is experiencing dreams and visions of Dracula as he continues on his bloody journey to find her. A professor, played by Christopher Plummer, then heads straight to New Orleans, to save Mary (whom is his daughter), in fear that Dracula will come to fulfill an ancient prophecy. It becomes a race against time as Dracula begins turning more and more victims into the living dead.The title to this movie is a little cheesy, but don't let that judge whether or not you want to see the movie. It has some decent acting, especially from legendary actor Christopher Plummer (who I was actually surprised to see in a movie of this type), good gore scenes, and some genuinely neat visuals throughout. The vampires here aren't too over the top, the makeup and fangs are just enough without over doing it. Their orchestrated movements (especially the three female vampires who attack Simon) was really neatly done and looked really cool. Granted, it isn't perfect, but if you want to see an okay little vampire movie, Dracula 2000 is the movie for you. 6/10.

He does a good job of being extremely alluring and sexy, all that Dracula is supposed to be. His eyes are the most amazing color when they are green and when they are red, which adds to his character. You almost feel like he's looking at you, which is appropriately creepy and lovely at the same time. Anyway, enough about how much I'm in love with Dracula. Johnny Lee Miller also did a good job, and has some good lines. As for Justine Waddell, she does not do a good job. She's too much of the helpless girl, and I think that even I could do it better than she did. Christopher Plummer is good, although his accent makes him sort of hard to understand at times.

He reminds me of a young Richard Burton with his dramatic reading of the role. A pity they cut short some of his scenes for the movie in the belief that it made the character of Count Dracula more remote and mysterious.Butler, with penetrating eyes and intent gaze, is a sinister (although attractive) figure indeed--but in all honesty, I have to confess that CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER, as Van Helsing, who uses leeches to keep the blood flowing, comes across as even creepier. Plummer plays the role in all earnestness, as though he thinks he's doing Shakespeare, but all in all is very effectively cast as Van Elsing. As I say, the only trouble is he's even darker than Dracula with his interpretation. Brilliant job, though.Too tiresome to go into all the plot machinations, but, needless to say, some of them are actually quite clever, especially the twist involving Dracula's origins which leads to a rather spectacular climax which has him caught up in a fiery death.Gerard Butler contributes to the impression I gained from PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, that he's an interesting actor to watch. I won't be surprised if he eventually gets a role that will have the critics appreciating his true worth. With his piercing gaze and thick dark hair, he reminds me so much of a young Richard Greene but without the dimples.Justine Waddell does well as the terrified Mary and Jonny Lee Miller makes an agreeable enough hero as the man who stands by her fight against Dracula's evil. His scenes with Christopher Plummer in the early part of the film are the best part of his performance, but he's interesting to watch throughout.Some scenes are not for the squeamish--although I'm sure horror fans can take any amount of gore that's dished out these days.Not bad, as far as these sort of things go. Gerard Butler fans will probably wish he was given even more footage, but it's Christopher Plummer who manages to be even more impressive as Van Elsing. A bit of trivia Joel Schumacher was inspired to cast Butler as The Phantom in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA after seeing him in this film.

He just isn't leading man material, at least in the conventional sense. Just look at the Tomb Raider film, where he played opposite Angelina Jolie - he's a well built, good looking guy, but you don't believe for a moment that he's any kind of match for Jolie/Croft. Nothing against Butler - I hope he thrives and has a long and rewarding career. I just don't feel he was able to pull off a role as the King Of Vampires - the weight, gravitas, and charisma isn't there yet, although it might be in another 10 years.Still, he has his fans, and he doesn't suck (heh-heh) - it's pretty obvious that he was let down by the direction and script as much as anything.There ARE several pretty good gimmicks here that raise the interest bar - the 'heist' scene that opens the movie as a group of high tech thieves use clever gimmicks to disable the guards and security devices that hold Van Helsing's (Plummer) greatest 'treasure'; Van Helsing's use of small portions of Drac's blood to live beyond his normal span of years so he can guard Drac's coffin; the 'haunted plane ride' patterned in tribute to the famous passage in the novel where an freighter arrives in an American port with no crew left except for a man lashed to the wheel; some pretty cool 'stake guns' and repeating crossbows, etc.; and a fairly novel explanation of Dracula's origin that stems from Judas Iscariot instead of Vlad the Impaler.On the down side; as I mentioned, Butler's a good looking guy, and he can act, but the camera and direction grant him almost no charisma, and he isn't all that interesting to watch. In fact everyone else seems to be adopting a 'TV movie of the week' level of acting, writing, and direction here; you might be impressed if you saw this as a USA or TNT 'original miniseries', but it doesn't really match up to 'feature film' levels.And once Drac show up in New Orleans, things pretty much lose steam. The possibilities are there - just ask Anne Rice - but after the movie gets out of the swamp where the plane crashes, 'Dracula 2000' just turns into another vampire potboiler, without the cheesy energy and zest of the old Hammer films that it was obviously meant to emulate.Still, not bad. I went to see this hoping for nothing more than an entertaining way to kill an empty evening, and while I wasn't especially impressed, I also wasn't angry or upset about wasting my admission fee. For what it's worth, I still thought this was more fun than Interview With The Vampire or that other Rice movie about the Queen Of the Damned or whatever it was.

They find a crypt with an ominous-looking coffin, not to mention some death traps that make quick work of a couple day players.  Most of the team wants to abandon the whole enterprise, but their leader is insistent.  After all, anything this well-guarded has to be worth a lot of money, right?At this point I'm thinking, where are the kids from Scream when you need them?  With their encyclopediac knowledge of horror films, they could have told these guys that anything this well-guarded a) contains some great, ancient evil and b) is probably not worth the effort of stealing when there are so many banks and convenience stores ripe for the picking.  But no, they make off with the coffin, and thus begins Dracula 2000, a silly and unimaginative modernization of Bram Stoker's novel.The coffin, of course, contains the grandaddy of all vampires himself, who wakes up during the flight from London to New Orleans and dines on the rest of the thieves.  Dracula is played by Gerard Butler in a manner that manages to avoid all of the menace, sensuality, power, and charm that various actors have brought to the role over the past century.  He spends his time stalking around and staring in a way that the women in the film apparently found irresistable, although I personally resisted it very easily.So Drac winds up walking the streets of New Orleans during Mardis Gras, because it is a sacred and ancient rule that any film which spends any amount of time in New Orleans must take place during Mardis Gras.  His ultimate prey is one Mary (Justine Waddell), a woman who dreams about him at night at works at Virgin Megastore during the day.  I would like to believe there was some sort of symbolism intended in having the heroine wear a t-shirt saying Virgin on it, but the product placement is so consistant and obtrusive that the effect is ruined.  Pursuing him is the owner of the antiques store, Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer), who initially claims to be the decendant of the guy who inspired the Bram Stoker character (or something like that) but is in fact the vampire hunter himself.  (How he's survived this long is a process I'd rather not get into right now.)  He's also Mary's father, which explains her dreams of blood but not much else. Van Helsing has a handsome assistant who is utterly useless apart from being someone to explain backstory to, and to make a rather flat romantic connection with Mary.Things proceed more or less the way you expect them to until the end, where Dracula 2000 reveals its one shred of originality.  Turns out Dracula is none other than Judas Iscariot, doomed to an undead existence after that whole business with the thirty pieces of silver and the kiss.  Frankly, I think worse things could have happened to him (the fate Dante envisioned for the most infamous of betrayers is particularly nasty), but never mind. This bit of information, presented in flashbacks that resemble those inspirational videos the Church of Latter-Day Saints advertises on cable, adds nothing to either Dracula's character or the story, and mainly just serves as a reason why vampires get so turned off by crosses when, say, a statue of Shiva doesn't faze them.  Anyway, Dracula tells off a gaudy neon crucifix before Mary hangs him off a building, where he bursts into flames as the sun rises.This being a modern horror film, the final scene is an obvious set-up for a sequel.

Whatever their motives in making movies, be it purely for financial gain as in the case of Jerry Bruckheimer or for artistic value as always in the case of directors of less popular films but far superior films like Christopher Nolan of Memento, these people have money and training enough to produce films with at least a vague idea of how they will turn out and how the viewing audience will react to them. Given that, I begin to wonder more and more with every modern horror film that's made. The horror genre has been reduced in recent years to idiot excursions by idiot characters into places that they should obviously not go into, and not because they're not allowed (that would make for an interesting story), but because going there would be an exercise in pure stupidity.Dracula 2000 takes the old Dracula story and puts it in the modern day and throws in a few dumbass teenagers as in the case of The House on Haunted Hill and The Haunting of Hill House (to a lesser extent), and we get to witness the ensuing routine madness. This time they even threw in the little addition that the movie takes place at Mardi Gras and is obviously funded by Virgin Records. At this point, the yawns that this formula induces are more satisfying than the movie itself. There's a scene around the middle of the movie (when Dracula has made several of his first attacks and made vampires out of the people who stole his coffin in the opening of the film) in which Simon (Johnny Lee Miller) and Matthew Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer) have just left an attack of these new vampires, and Simon asks Van Helsing (the keeper of Dracula's coffin) what the hell just happened back there. As soon as Van Helsing explains that it's Dracula, Simon moves to get out of the car right then and there, as we would like to do at this point, but he is pulled back into the car and forced to listen. It's good that we're able to relate to Simon's character in our own wish to escape, but not that great that we are just as uncomfortable as he is about staying with this thing to the end.(spoilers)We soon learn in direct dialogue that Van Helsing is a vampire himself who uses leeches to take blood from Dracula's corpse to satisfy his own bloodlust, which disgusts him and reminds us of the exact same thing that we saw in Blade. Now, the first thing that pops into my head after realizing that the movie is stealing directly from the premise of Blade is why the hell would anyone want to steal from that movie? We have also just learned that Van Helsing has been searching for most of his life for a way to kill Dracula for good, but so far has had no success. Kind of like Michael Meyers. Or Jason Voorhees. We're getting, in other words, a very watered-down version of the old evil-can't-be-killed excuse for making another horror movie out of a successful classic. We just saw the exact same thing happen with the Friday the 13th series in the pathetic Jason X, we've seen it happen in the Halloween series with Halloween H20 (and are about to see it again, by the way, in Halloween Resurrection), and now we're seeing it with Dracula. The evil that can't be killed, it seems, has moved from the movie screen and into the offices of Hollywood producers. The evil is their greed, and evidently it really can't be killed!I love how the movie completely halts in its tracks long enough to show a Linkin Park video with the Virgin Records logo in the lower corner of the screen, and then we see Dracula 2000 himself walk into a Virgin Records store while all the women in the store start drooling and rubbing themselves. During the course of the movie, we are treated to a lot of color-filtered, talky nonsense punctuated with the occasional cheap scare, basically exactly the same thing you get in every other crappy horror movie that's released every few months these days.Every character in the film is instantly forgettable, you can almost forget about a character in between scenes, so obviously there's no way you could ever care what happens to any of them. Christopher Plummer presents the only character of at least remote interest, but the rest of the cast are on auto-pilot, delivering routine performances of characters that even they don't seem to connect with. One girl in the film comments just after being turned into a vampire that it's `better than chocolate,' illustrating the modern depths to which the Dracula story has been forced to sink.There are entirely too many scantily clad female vampires in this movie, reminding me of the awful Tales From the Crypt film, Bordello of Blood, and the closing scenes of the movie don't do much for it, either. There are extensive ties to religion in the story of Dracula at the end of the film, which do nothing but make us sit and endure it for a little longer, and we get the usual two heroes holding each other and breathing heavily, covered in blood and looking on at the destruction of their enemy. This is just a basic, basic horror movie that doesn't get scary or even tense at any time, but rather tries to cash in on an age-old tale by retelling it with modern characters and themes. Nothing new here, and really nothing much to see. I would suggest that you feel free to skip this one.

Many other actors have played this part, and Gerard Butler was the latest in Dracula 2000.  He plays his part adequately, and looks very modern.  The entire movie attempts to bring the vampire creation of Bram Stoker into the new millennium with a loud rock soundtrack and a modern story.  Abraham Van Helsing is still alive, and still chasing the Count.  The story showcases some eye-catching visual effects, and a bit of interesting writing.  But it's still hard to forget Tod Browning and Bela Lugosi's interpretation of the classic monster.  Bela's image is even featured at Mardi Gras, and serves only to remind us of the original. "},{"Title":"Wooden acting and hackneyed storytelling are the high-lights for this generic vampyric tale.","Date":"1 August 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  You'd think that being the first Dracula movie of the millennium, this tale would have had new twists and fresher appeal to its loyal audience. Unfortunately, this tale spins gimmicks that have been featured in just about every other vampire film that have been produced to date and you will find yourself blowing more cobwebs off them than there are featured in the film itself.Unlike Gus Van Sant's 1998 re-telling of Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, where that film was remade scene by scene to appeal to a new generation, DRACULA 2000 attempts to inject something fresh into its storytelling, but comes off as something that seems to have been rehashed many times before.Many kudos goes out to film veteran Christopher Plummer for taking on the role of Matthew Van Helsing. Here, his character has been given a new directive - to exist as Dracula's keeper for eternity. The question you may be asking yourselves is, Why? The answers that are given in the film are quite insufficient. Particularly pertaining to Dracula's demise in this film, the viewer is left to wonder just why Van Helsing could not destroy him in the same manner to begin with. Which leaves us with the general premise of this movieDracula's coffin remains locked in a maximum-security safe, maintained by Van Helsing himself. A group of thieves attempt robbery of the coffin, 'MISSION IMPOSSIBLE'-style, using hi-tech gadgets and state-of-the-art machinery to achieve their mission. But it doesn't take a fool to predict the outcome of their task. Dracula is unleashed upon a new generation and it is up to Van Helsing and his assistant, played by Jonny Lee Miller, to stop him.As with every other DRACULA film, the same rules apply here. A stake through the heart, removal of the vampire's head and direct sunlight are the only ways a vampire can be killed. Gone are the cloves of garlic, crucifixes and the ring of fire... BUT we are introduced to a new technique - silver bullets. This is usually identified with the slaying of werewolves and in this film's case, can be used to destroy vampires, but again, only if fired through the heart.The key to this film is Van Helsing's daughter. Long removed by her mother around various cities of the world to escape Dracula's watchful eye, she now resides in New Orleans. Her mother is now deceased and she has begun to have nightmares about Dracula's impending resurrection. This is one of the film's main weaknesses. Unlike heroines portrayed in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL, this character is yet another one of those whimpering females who become rather annoying after awhile. Unable to defend herself and quite oblivious to common sense, we have to rely on Jonny Lee Miller to step in and take charge so her character may be preserved.One of the other film's weaknesses is the over-useage of smoke machines. From the opening scenes when Dracula's coffin is examined to a climatic scene that occurs in a deserted cemetery, we see way too much smoke and not enough action. Furthermore, bit parts are played by Jennifer Esposito, Jerri Ryan, Colleen Vitamin C Fitzpatrick and Omar Epps as fellow vampires and each one of these actors give off quite a dull performance.But the main weakness of this movie is Dracula himself. Had the casting director not chosen such a handsome actor, we as the audience wouldn't be rooting for his character half the time when he's about to committ some sort of evil doing. It was wise in such films as SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE and Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA to hire actors such as Willem Dafoe and Gary Oldman to portray Dracula, where the audience revelled on their acting skills and not so much as their looks. THIS particular Dracula should have been appearing on a Calvin Klein billboard and not skulking around some dank basement sporting a pair of goofy fangs.Which brings me to the conclusion of my review. A lot like LOST SOULS and END OF DAYS, this is another generic 'horror' film where the audience didn't really care either way if good or evil prevailed. The acting was sub-par, the special effects were rather tame, and the whole assumption that this movie would inject some sort of new blood into the genre did not come through. Overall, I was disappointed. I applaud DIMENSION films for being brave enough to attempt the impossible, but no film will ever outdo the almighty NOSFERATU.MY GRADE 4/10 "},{"Title":"The famous Dracula has return in present day to create some anarchy in the city.","Date":"10 July 2001","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  I remember hearing mixed reviews for this film when it hit the theaters and after actually viewing the movie for myself, I can see why. It had some good points and some bad. In the end, I figured the film was okay. Starts off with a bunch of thieves breaking into a huge vault in hopes of finding money or some type or riches. What they end up finding is Dracula in his coffin. The rest is predictable. Drac gets out, sucks some necks, and creates some vamps, blah, blah.Anyway, there were a lot of familiar faces in the movie, like Johnny Lee Miller from Hackers, but it's too bad they couldn't save it. The effects were somewhat good in parts and really cheesy in others. The movie had some nice action scenes, but in the end it just turns out to be flat out silly. Especially when you can easily see the computer effects of flying heads and such. What a waste.The directing was pretty good and so was some of the acting. Gerard Butler was excellent as Dracula, and pulled it off quite well. What I didn't really like was how they created these new origins of how Dracula came about. I thought trying to change it to give the film a twist was a bit dumb. They could have done a better job.What I did like was seeing Dracula walk about the city streets with all these people around him. It's not every movie that you see Dracula walking into a Virgin Records store. There weren't any creepy or scary moments in the film that I know of. It was fun to watch sometimes, but then would get a little dumb. Like I said before, the plot needs a lot of work.I would have given the movie a lower rating, but I thought some of it was fun to watch. Does this film match up with other previous vamp flicks? Not really. Bram Stoker's Dracula kicks is obviously the best. There's no comparison.An okay vampire film with some cool scenes here and there. Needs a lot of work on the plot. Could have been a lot better. Not really recommended, unless you got nothing else to rent.

The movie tells a tale of how Dracula who cannot be killed but is entombed in a silver coffin by Abraham Van Helsing for over 100 years in a high tech prison in a large antique shop in London (looks more like a bank).

Dracula 2000 is not the awful train-wreck it could have been. Mostly this is because of decent effects and wire-work and some passable acting.In fact, a number of actors show up heere that either were well-known at the time or went on to become known later - Danny Masterson from 70's Show , Jeri Ryan from Voyager and Nathan Fillion from Firefly all have bit-parts.Of course the primary acting talent is provided by Christopher Plummer as Van Helsing. I'd say he's rather restrained here, but my view is probably coloured by the fact that I recently watched Star Trek Undiscovered Country where he played a Klingon, so draw your own conclusions. Suffice to say that he acts without apparent effort, which cannot be said for all of the cast, especially the relative unknowns.But on the whole, D2K is reasonably entertaining. On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being something along the lines of Dusk til Dawn and 1 being something dreary and tedious like Captain Kronos, Vampire Hunter, Dracula 2000 scores a solid 6 in my estimation. It's popcorn fodder mostly and, mostly, it delivers on that basis.However, where any horror film falls down (unless like Dusk til Dawn it's actually played for laughs) is when it makes the audience chuckle at supposedly inappropriate moments. D2K has a number of these moments, such as the leech attack moment with Danny Masterson (I'll let you find out the details for yourself...) and the unintentionally funny vampire flying moments. Luckily (or perhaps not, depending on your point of view and what you like to get out of movies like this) the scenes do not detract greatly from the rest of the package.What you get is a standard vampire flick with plenty of action and gore and the odd special vampire slaying weapon thrown in for good measure. Worth a watch when there's nothing much else on. Just don't expect tension and horror, really.

They have a sexy American chick working for them, and her partners in crime are planning to steal whatever it is Van Helsing has so heavily guarded.They plan an elaborate heist and all they find is a coffin&#133;and booby traps that kill two henchmen. Still the now four henchmen steal the coffin and take it to a cargo plane.Van Helsing, alerted, tells Simon to watch the business and mysteriously flies to America in search of his daughter.Cut to America where a pretty Brit Mary and her roommate Lucy, both working for Virgin records in New Orleans, are talking. Mary has visions of being trapped in a coffin with a man.Meanwhile on the cargo plane Dracula is awakened and chomps his way through the crew of the plane, which crashes&#133;near New Orleans.Simon follows Van Helsing and they discuss vampirism, Van Helsing tells Simon he has Dracula's blood inside him, keeping him alive. They travel to where the crash happened to see the bodies, and sure enough they are all vampires. The pair kill them except for the hot American, then they escape to New Orleans just in time for Mardi Gras.Mary now has visions of the very hot Dracula (Butler) eating people and looking at her with a very forlorn expression, and we realize this is Van Helsing's daughter, blood of Drac''s blood, the woman Dracula most desires.Dracula then eats a female reporter and Mary's roommate Lucy, forming the triumvirate of sexy female vamps who tease and torture Simon at every turn.Mary is slowly seduced by Dracula (and trust me, seeing him, what woman wouldn't? Gerard Butler could chomp me any time) and discovers his secret.He is not Vlad the Impaler, he is much older.The brightest point is that Wes craven has finally found a much more plausible explanation for whey Dracula is repelled by Christian object like crosses, though the way it is played out seems a little hokey.Of course the ending is very weak. We know Good will triumph, and Dracula, who supposedly can't be killed, is way too easily done in by one of Bram Stoker's cure-alls (sunlight, stakes, crosses).But at the very end he shows compassion for a victim, and I have to wonder, was he really so bad? Craven never lets me know, no matter how many times I've watched this.Drac seems lonely, something of a romantic, and at the same time his is an antisocial serial killer.I'd say this is for Gerard Butler fans, Johnny Lee Miller fans, or people who love vampire movies and books. Here I saw the inspiration for the jumping scene in the opening of Underworld, and probably 80% of Sherrilyn Kenyon's Night books(Night Embrace being the first), sold as romance novels for women.

The flying scenes are particularly well done.  There are one or two startle points in the film that may get your adrenaline going, but that's way too few for this sort of film.  There were some attempts at humor, but they were awfully weak.  Even the inside jokes are poorly done.  (For example, the name on the headstone in one of the action scenes is rubbed in your face so strongly that it's tiresome rather than enjoyable.)I also found it irritating that the story went well outside the tradition of vampire lore for its key plot point.  One of the things that draws many of us to vampire stories is the familiarity we have with the rules of the undead.  Bending these rules -- as, for example, Anne Rice has done -- can enrich the genre, but inventing new ones in search of a plot device is lazy and regrettable.I love a good vampire movie.

When his film came out, he wasn't even a name in movies. It is kind of interesting then to go back to see the guy's starting point.The first year of a new millennium is a time for all kinds of celebration and liberties, including film marketing. Titles like Godzilla 2000, or Pokemon the movie 2000, and this are super pretentious and the films probably wouldn't have been any worse or better were they made the previous year, or the next one. That said, there is something about Dracula 2000 that could distinguish it from Bela Lugosi, Frank Langella, Gary Oldman, and the two or three others. What could that something be? Most critics would say it is pure silliness. Dracula 2000 is a pretty stupid movie no doubt. It has a clumsy narrative, a cheesy script, and a major religious idiocy, but it also takes some artistic liberties worthy of noting. There are times when Dracula 2000 works well as a kind of neo-surrealist feature. About half the movie (maybe a little less) plays out like a dream sequence, or rather a nightmare. (no points for guessing what year this is set in) Dr. Van Helsing once managed to trap Dracula, and has since kept him locked away to protect humanity. Using some of Dracula's blood, the old man has been able to keep himself alive. One night, a series of contrived circumstances sets Dracula loose, and he goes after Van Helsing's daughter who is in New Orleans. the good doctor and his young intern go after him.Dracula 2000 has a bit going for it. It is not quite as thrilling as it should've been, and definitely not as scary. If you are a horror fan, watch it and decide for yourself.

The movie gets really messy and the story is hard to keep track on, not because it's being so complicated but because it gets told so poorly and confusing. You'll hardly feel involved with anything that is happening in this movie and with its main characters.I'm also not sure who was supposed to be he main character and 'hero' of this movie. At times it's like its the Van Helsing character, while at others its Simon Sheppard or Mary Heller. It's also really part of the reason why the movie feels so messy and definitely distant at times.It never seems like a really great idea to update a classic horror story to this present time. You have the feeling though that this movie still could had worked out, had it been more like it's first 20 minutes or so. Now it instead feels like a completely redundant and forgettable movie that tries to update the Dracula story.Because it is modern it's also using lots of more modern effects. The special effects are not horrible but at parts they are however far from convincing, which also works distracting from the movie.The movie also has some weird casting, with Gerard Butler as the Count Dracula. Unlike now days, early in his career Butler was and looked like quite a softy.

There are your typical hot young actors who, in theory, should be rising stars, but I rarely ever hear much about these performers after I see them in movies like these. But do teen-based horror films have to suck? No, but filmmakers generally seem to think that people of this age group (that includes me, I'm 18) have short attention spans and require flashy, MTV-style camera-work to hold our interest. Plot-wise...ah, what does this movie care about plot. Apparently, a 21st century Abraham Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer) is keeping Dracula in a high-tech vault, complete with booby traps and such. Some (very) young thieves manage to break into this highly guarded vault, taking the coffin with them, thinking there's something valuable inside. Yep, it's Dracula and from there on he goes to New Orleans in search of his soulmate.Dracula 2000 actually begins quite well, with a suspenseful opening in which most of the cast we've been introduced to up to that point is killed off. Can't say I've seen that in any recent film lately. But the film just falls apart from there, with so many mistakes I don't even know where to begin.First, there's Patrick Lussier's direction. In what should have been an action-filled gorefest a la From Dusk Till Dawn, we instead get sporadic fight scenes that are haphazardly directed. Quick cuts, flashy editing, jerky slow-motion, and even tilted camera angles are employed to make us think, wow, this is so cool! Scene transitions are awful, going from simple scenes with sudden hallucinations and flashbacks that grow immediately tiresome. Vampires appear, say some sultry dialogue, then just vanish into thin air. Dracula turns into a wolf, then back to himself, then wolf, then back to himself and so on and so forth in another one of those badly edited scenes that's there for the cool factor. The story, interesting at first, just gets lame, with the typical Dracula quest for his female companion. For once, I'd like a Dracula film where the titular vampire is more ambitious than that. Then there's the movie's big plot twist, revealing the true identity of Dracula. I'm sure some will be shocked, amazed, thrilled. Me, I was shaking my head in disbelief at such a hilarious notion, and the way this twist is presented makes it even harder to swallow. The film sets up the dilemma that Dracula can't be killed, yet (major spoiler) the movie's finale clearly shows he can die by means of sunlight (though you have to ask yourself why doesn't just use his ability to float when he has that wire around his neck), which makes us wonder why Van Helsing didn't just expose the drained body of Dracula to the rising sun when he was still in possession of the ancient bloodsucker?The special effects are pretty cheesy, with some of the cleanest-looking decapitations I've ever seen. The CGI bats are unconvincing, and the mist that accompanies Dracula's entrance almost had me thinking I was watching a stage production. Word to filmmakers mist generally isn't scary. Don't use it unless it's vital to the plot.Acting's a messy mix, with Jonny Lee Miller faring the best if only because he doesn't have to act like a sultry vampire or pout a lot of ranting dialogue. The cast is really quite large, so perhaps the most important are Justine Waddell as the heroine and Gerard Butler as Dracula. Waddell's okay, and while Butler gets in a couple of decent moments, this guy just doesn't look creepy enough for the part. Jennifer Esposito and Jeri Ryan are on hand to show some cleavage, and Vitamin C flashes her breasts. Last and actually least, Christopher Plummer delivers an amusing accent.Dracula 2000's a mess, the script is all over the map, the direction is wildly out of sync, and even the score is obtrusive and hard to listen to.

It seems that Dr. Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer)discovered that Dracula could not be destroyed, so instead he froze him and sealed him in a fancy casket and made a vow not to die himself so that he could protect the world from this menace (quite convenient.) But Dracula is, of course, freed from his prison and reeks havoc. And it seems Van Helsing has a daughter (Mary, played by Justine Waddell) who has some unexplained connection to Dracula (at least if there was an explanation I missed it, as my attention kept wandering to more interesting things like watching the plants in our living room grow.)

Produced by Wes Carven (and yeah they throw that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help. The messy script does get considerably silly. Lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy, inserting a lot of blood (the make-up is suitably achieved) and a lot of Virgin advertising. No I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and Helsing's daughter works there too. Oh that wasn't obvious planting. The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. Now the performances are all over the shop, but there are few familiar faces to spot (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just didn't come off, as not much of a presence was formed. He was simply out-shined by the succulent ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides.

Sounds like an original 21st century update of Bram Stroker's classic vampire tale. Take the mythology of Dracula and give it new life by pulling it into the year 2000 - the possibilities are potentially endless. Well, suffice to say that's not what we have here. Although, the title is still pretty applicable. &#145;Dracula 2000' shamelessly hinges on and shows off the commercial gimmicks and techniques that happened to be popular at exactly that moment in time wire-hung kung-fu fights, end-of-the-century religious iconography not to mention hot young actors, or teens from TV on their summer hiatus. Likable people such as Omar Epps, Justine Waddell, Danny Masterson and Colleen Fitzpatrick barely register while hotties Jeri Ryan and Jennifer Esposito walk away with the movie just by showing up in brief and criminally underused appearances. I can often be fair to vampire (as well as werewolf, zombie, ect.) movies as genera flicks where other real critics just instantly dismiss them, but &#145;Dracula 2000' is beyond bad - one of the worst vampire movies in recent memory.  It melds so many unrelated elements that it's barely a Dracula movie to begin with though. The increasingly convoluted story involves `Dracula' being awakened by a gang of thieves (with some high tech devices) and heading back to his aristocratic lifestyle in the underbelly of New Orleans. '2000'  throws so much on so little that I threw up may hands early on, abandoning any serious attempt to follow the thing. It starts off with a narrow, base-level premise and smoothly slides into an incoherent mess of pounding rock and flashing images. The movie is directed by Patrick Lussier, a long-time editor of Wes Craven films. As one of the most talented horror directors in the business, Craven often lends his name to the producer credit of these type of B-grade horror flicks to give horror fans the feeling that a `Wes Craven presents' before the title will give the movie some clout. I have immense respect for Craven the director and conversely just as much disregard for Craven the producer (further proof to my theory that producers &#150; despite `Hollywood insider' comedies arrogantly showing them as a movie's true controlling creative force &#150; don't do anything but hamper a production). Lussier may be replicating the technical gimmicks in a decent manner. The movie looks halfway decent and movies at a pace that makes it almost tolerable in parts. He may have proven he can roll cable and not blow out bulbs long enough to work up to the director's chair, but unfortunately he doesn't bring anything beyond a technical eye to the story construction. No sense of dramatic tension, attention to character, cohesiveness or even the slightest bit of simple, free-spirited fun to the proceedings. There isn't an idea or plot point in the movie that doesn't feel like it was worked over to death by the script being passed through the hands of a committee making sure everybody got to have their say. There is nothing about &#145;Dracula 2000' that inspires an active disdain for it as many real turkeys do&#150; it's just nothing. The very definition of `disposable' cinema. It will spend much of its life on the video rack (or late night Sci-Fi Channel) where it should have gone directly in the first place.

It sort of looks as though soft-focus has been employed, but it doesn't look quite like that, either.  Maybe the footage was chewed over by a computer in order to incorporate special digital effects - but what effects?  Often we're just looking at Mary standing next to a rack of CDs, talking.  It also sort of looks, in some indefinable way, like reality TV, and this must be due to the LOOK, rather than the acting or the script or the direction (all of which are standard, classical teen horror).  Maybe it was something to do with the lighting.  Whatever the explanation, it's a visual disaster; it doesn't look right, it doesn't look good - it is, in fact, impossible to take seriously any of what's happening, when it looks the way it does.

Regardless, I don't really consider it a twist or anything but I can't say I was expecting it either, but then again would anyone? It's not like an awesome twist in a mystery or anything for the story only commented on the fact that crosses don't work etc. Like a said, that was the only good aspect of the story. The rest of it was completely a joke, and the set-ups for minor characters deaths seemed too much like plot-devices to the point of ridiculousness. I felt like I was watching a movie instead of being drawn into one. Scenes did not add up or make cohesive scene. They were just stupid!For instance (Major Spoilers)- If you are a Detective, possibly related (or a least aware of) to the case where five dead plane-crash victims are in a church under suspicious circumstances! And the bodies are found out of their body bags! One is missing, three have silver stakes in them! Do you still smugly interview one of those dead bodies or woman (Esposito) who had a stake in her shoulder about her mental state for she thinks she is a vampire? In this film, the Detective does even though his men would have found quite a site that Van Hesling and Sam caused in a previous scene, and he took the interview after his men would have removed a stake from her shoulder- and no doubt found several bodies and a dead cop with teeth marks- hint hint. Surely the Detective may not be this SMUG when interviewing someone who was recently found on a plane DEAD- even if he didn't know she was one of the dead bodies, she was in the scene (i.e. The Church) under suspicious vampire-like circumstances with dead bodies that were originally found under suspicious vampire-like circumstances on a plane- who are now all out of their body-bags with stakes in their heart. Surely, the Detective might be a little less skeptical and little less smug? I found the whole scene with Solina and the Detective laughable as a ploy for insert next victim here scene, without much thought.Not only that, why the **** would Solina (Esposito) be dressed in a hospital gown getting her mental state questioned by some Detective in the first place???? SHE'S A VAMPIRE! Cops rock up, find her nailed to a wall, and the next scene she's being interviewed???? Seriously! Couldn't she have just killed some cops and gotten away in the first place, or even while they were changing her from her previous clothes to the oh I'm nuts gown. No, there she is alone in interview room talking to a Detective who disbelieves her (Stupidly)- so that's when shows off her powers. Powers...that's right, powers. So why didn't she use them earlier?...oh yeah, because we want that obvious set-up for new scene. Not only that, Solina can see through a reflected mirror to see the Detective, but in an later scene, the all powerful Dracula got captured from NOT being able to see through a mirror! Plot-holes everywhere so far, and there is more and I won't bother getting into all of them. Well, here's another!Before Solina gets captured by the Police, Sam (Johnny Lee Miller) nails her shoulder to the wall, but doesn't kill her when she says what will the Police think?. I mean really!?!? Even though Sam already staked a vampire earlier, he's worried about Police- shouldn't he be MORE worried about Solina coming alive again in the first place? What's the Police going to do, arrest him for killing a dead body? And doesn't Solina realise that the Police would be wondering why five dead bodies are out of their bags, and one of them is now alive- nailed to the wall. The plot is THAT BAD. Even if the cops didn't know she was the dead body in the body-bag, why would a writer seriously put that question to the protagonist in the first place as an excuse for Sam not to kill Solina? Would Sam really be worried about the Police...would Solina (a vampire) use it as an excuse to get the upper hand in a situation where she is the one that's undead. Don't you think she'd have a hard time explaining to the Police why she's got a stake in her shoulder, and why there is a dead cop with bite marks on his neck. Don't you think Sam went past the point of worrying about Police when he killed the first vampire. I mean hello! There was more plot-holes and annoying cliches in this film, that got seriously on my nerves. 'Dracula 2000' is a really bad adaption of the Dracula story. Hey, nice concept at the end- but unforgivable and unexplained narrative moments where a characters are placed in ludicrous set-ups for scenes (i.e. The Detective interviewing a gowned Solina). Another example is Sam finding out the where Dracula took Mary. One minute, Dracula captures Mary at a Graveyard to Sam's dismay...and then straight-away Sam is at a Street-party and just happens to see Solina and the other chick vampires. How did you go from a graveyard to a Street-party??? Also, how did Van Hesling end up in New Orleans so quick? Why didn't the robbers open the coffin before they got on the plane? Also, another major gripe is that you presume others were turned into vampires as well, 'Dracula 2000' doesn't make all the minor characters fates clear!But the worst aspect of this film in my opinion is the BLATANT product placement of Virgin Records. Ok, a reviewer out-lined that cause Mary worked Virgin Record Store (i.e. Virgin Mary), it might have been a hint to the ending. What a stupid hint, huh? Even if it was, could we be anymore blatant than flaunting the Virgin Records symbol everywhere? Give clues in the story, not in over-glossed product placement. It stuck out offensively like a sore-thumb in several scenes!The performances were all fairly tame. Gerard Butler was decent as Dracula, but his character was stupid. Ditto for the excellent Christopher Plummer, who has had better performances and better roles. I have to say that I think Johnny Lee Miller knew he was in a stinker, and I won't even bother commenting on the rest of the cast. The 3 Vampire chicks were all over the place!I watched the DVD version, and I must not that Patrick Lussier should have kept some the original extended instead of changing them. That's how bad this film, that you scratch your head looking at the extended scenes, and wonder why they were changed. Regardless, I don't think it would have improved the film that much- it's really that bad. 'Dracula 2000' could have been so much better if it didn't seem so phony and contrived especially with plot set-ups and product-placement, and if Patrick Lussier and his writers got rid the bad plot-devices and put more thought into the narrative structure and tying all the scenes together in a realistic manner so the film was opposed to stupidity. 'Dracula 2000' is badly directed but notably a badly-scripted film which had a nice concept for the end, but the events leading up to it were beyond stupidity and past the point of ridiculousness. 'Dracula 2000' is neither scary or compelling, and has a cliche silly narrative-structure with uninteresting characters and one of the worst cases of product-placement ever put in a horror film!    * out of *****!

Wes Craven may be helping to produce, but it is not scary, it is not that thrilling, the clichés are too many, and it is just a little lame, I think only the special effects and the vampire concept are going to keep you very, very mildly interested. Okay! "}]
