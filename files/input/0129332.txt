[{"Title":"So Much More Than Cannibalism","Date":"12 July 2000","Score":"119 out of 136 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  If someone were to ask what Ravenous is all about, the easiest thing to say would be `It's about cannibalism in a remote Army outpost in the 1800s.' That's exactly right, and that's probably what kept audience members away from Ravenous when it briefly ran in theaters back in 1999.  Cannibalism? Who needs to watch that?  Indeed.Yes, there is cannibalism in Ravenous.  Quite a lot of it, in fact.  The film is steeped in murder, the eating of human flesh, and is flavored with madness.  At times the film can be downright difficult to watch, though the compelling nature of the narrative keeps the viewer's eyes locked on the screen for the full ninety-eight minutes.Ravenous is so much more than a meditation on people eating other people, though it's obvious there was a great deal of confusion about how exactly to present this dish to the public.  Its plot is fairly simple for the first half Mexican War hero (and hidden coward) Lt. Boyd, played by LA Confidential's Guy Pearce, is assigned to an end-of-the-Earth fortress in the western Sierra Nevadas.  This fort, populated over the winter by a tiny handful of misfit officers and enlisted men, receives a visitor in the person of a starving man with an awful story of a failed mountain crossing that eclipses the Donner Party's.  What happens then is so twisted, but skillfully crafted, that it would be criminal to spoil what transpires.But Ravenous is not just a horror story.  What lies at its heart is an allegory about man's relationship to other men and how society structures itself around the powerful and the powerless.  Issues such as the morality of Manifest Destiny and even the ethics of simple meat eating are touched upon.  Guy Pearce gives an underplayed performance so low-key that he almost vanishes into the film stock, while co-star Robert Carlyle (most recently in The World is Not Enough) plays opposite him with delightful nuance.  The material even brings deeply textured work out of Tim Burton stalwart Jeffrey Jones as the commander of the fort, and scattered around these three are solid supporting actors like Jeremy Davies, who's much better here than he was in Saving Private Ryan, and David Arquette.If anything works against Ravenous at all, it's the curious inclusion of humor at the outset of the picture.  Director Antonia Bird, who also made Priest and Safe, is not known for her lighter side, which makes the appearance of a goofy epigram at the very start of the picture, and the use of some bizarrely inappropriate music during a later sequence, seem more like some producer's half-hearted attempt to blunt the sharp edge of the film's commentary with silliness.Luckily for the viewer and the film, however, Ravenous is far too powerful a motion picture to be undercut in this fashion.  By the time the final reel has passed, any memory of earlier missteps is forgotten as the pace grows more deliberate and the action becomes bloodier and bloodier up until the final moments.Unjustly neglected on the screen, Ravenous is a film with a great deal to say.  It's only too bad that cannibalism was the best way to say it.

This is only a horror film in the sense that Macbeth is or The Godfather.  It's about the horror of monstrosity, particularly the monstrosity inside ourselves.  It's not about cannibalism, nor is it a black comedy.  It has those things in it, but they are not it's raison d'etre.  It's about the horror of war, conquest, taking things which don't belong to you with the sole justification that that's how you get ahead in life.  You have what the other man has literally by consuming it. The hero of this film is branded a coward when really all he's done is preserved himself from the madness going on around him, a fight in which he has no part, just like this one.  And yet, I see reviewers here referring to his 'cowardice' as a given.  They haven't even got to first base about questioning whether he might not actually be a coward in the first place.  It looks like everybody's checked their brains in at the door with this one.  I'm glad I  never directed this movie, it would be soul-destroying to be this misunderstood.  It's a great movie.  Savage, brutal,poetic. You watch the whole thing with your mouth hanging open in sheer disbelief.  It's a feast for the eyes and ears and has one of the most fey, eerie qualities I've ever seen in a film.  It's a masterpiece and I would urge anyone out there who can leave their preconceptions and genre expectations at home to see it.  Give yourself a treat - be amazed.

I think part of the reason I love `Ravenous' so much is that it often seems that no one else does; either due to not having seen it, or just not appreciating it.  I admit, it's the kind of movie you're going to love or hate, either you get it or you don't.  But I can remember seeing it in the theater the first time, and just not being able to believe that I was laughing at what I was laughing at.   That's really the best way I can sum up my reaction to this film; there's a certain absurdity underlying all of its themes. It seems like the biggest confusion with people/critics and `Ravenous' is over whether or not it's intent is to be comic.  Indeed the comic tone is established from the very beginning, from the opening quotes and first scene.  To be sure, it is certainly dark, very very dark comedy, with an interesting mix of `cannibal/vampirism' (see Roger Ebert's review, the only one I've read that does Ravenous justice). However, director Antonia Bird does carry some more serious themes throughout Ravenous, but with a biting satirical edge-- she particularly seems to be commenting on American excessive consumption of all kinds, from meat-eating (and human-flesh eating in this case), to manifest destiny.  Most powerful is the truthful notion that we all must kill to live in some way or another, and in our willingness or unwillingness to do so, we must differentiate between cowardice and morality.  I'm just pounding the dark comedy thing into the ground though because I think that watching Ravenous, it is very important to keep in mind that principally it is supposed to be humorous, and yes, you are supposed to laugh at cannibalism believe it or not, because if you don't, you'll probably just find the film gory and disgusting.Ravenous is carried by its bold, wacky, charismatic characters.  Well, okay, the one exception here is Guy Pearce as central character Captain John Boyd, who is rather subdued in contrast to everyone else, quite intentionally so. Pearce does a very fine job making Boyd very quiet, introspective, and uncomfortable as he is sent to the wonderfully creepy and dysfunctional Fort Spencer, due to his discovered cowardice in war. Robert Carlysle is also excellent as the crazy Colqhoun/Ives. I liked the rest of the people at Fort Spencer, all eccentric in their own ways, although all may not last too long. It's nice to see Jeremy Davies as the adorable, religious Toffler, but Neal McDonough is the real stand out as the tough, super-hero like character of Reicht, `the soldier'; with his icy blue eyes and shocking white-blond hair he is the epitome of bravery and masculinity, and certainly forms a direct contrast to the sensitive, cautious, and all-too-human Boyd. Basically, the plot comes to revolve around an old Native American legend--the Wendigo myth&#150;-which states when a man eats another man he takes on his strength and spirit.  There are quite a few twists and turns and surprises in Ravenous that should be enough to hold any viewer's attention.The soundtrack to this film is also quite striking and omnipresent; with original eerily beautiful orchestral tracks that add much of the atmosphere in every situation. Particularly beautiful is the simple, little &#145;Boyd's theme', which is used throughout the film as Boyd journeys.  The music adds not only to the eerieness of the film, but yes, even the humor.  If there is any point at which I still had any kind of doubt about Ravenous being comical it was shattered in a scene where Boyd and Reicht go after the evil Ives, and I hear classic banjo `chase music' complete with yodelling; you just can't help but laugh and shake your head. And even though everyone else already has, I'll give another nod to the cinematography of the gorgeous yet bleak and dangerous icy mountain range.Ravenous is classic for scenes of such absurd, dark humor in any situation, as when (in the same chase scene) Boyd leaps off a cliff to go tumbling down a hill and crashes into Reicht.  Just when a moment is getting serious, it boldly will hit you with such a cartoonish image. Like i said, either you'll love it, or you just won't. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about Ravenous that grabs me so much, but it is just a combination of everything. It's like no movie I've ever seen. It's smart, satirical, observant and insightful (watch for a nice use of Ben Franklin quotes), and yes, funny. While not for everyone, it surely has cult film potential written all over it.

Apparently it had troubled beginnings with the original director being fired and Antonia Bird coming in as a last minute replacement at the behest of co-star Robert Carlyle ('Trainspotting') who had previously worked with her on 'Priest', a more different movie than this you couldn't imagine! Anyway, Bird triumphed and ended up with an excellent movie. David Arquette and Jeremy Davies are two actors I have little time for but they didn't have much on screen time and didn't detract from the great performances by Carlyle and 'Memento's Guy Pearce, who really sold the movie to me. I also really liked the role played by Tim Burton regular Jeffrey Jones. I enjoyed the work of all three actors, the unpredictable script, the inventive direction, and the unusual score by Peter Greenaway regular Michael Nyman and Blur's Damon Albarn, which reminded me at times of cult favourites Penguin Cafe Orchestra. 'Ravenous' isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen but I have enjoyed it all three times I've watched it and that's a lot more than I can say about most movies around these days. It's wicked fun with very clever touches of black comedy, and I highly recommend it.

The fort is manned by a drunk, a pothead, a Native American woman and her brother, a goofy young chaplain, a nonchalant Colonel and a half-crazed soldier named Reich. Shortly after Boyd's arrival, a frostbitten man appears one night out of the snowstorm and is taken in. After a quick and miraculous recovery, the man, a Scotsman name of Colqhoun, tells a harrowing tale. He and a party of five others had been stranded in a snow storm and took refuge in a cave. When their food ran out, they turned to cannibalism. Colquhoun claims to have escaped before he too could be eaten. The men of Fort Spencer quickly mobilize and, guided by Colqhoun, they head off to search for survivors. But, too late, they discover that there are no survivors. Colqhoun is a ravenous cannibal, and may possibly be a mythical beast called Wendigo. Only the cowardly Boyd survives the bloody ambush...but will he conquer the cannibal, or join him?This is a bitterly black comedy, a weird combination of the Donner Party tragedy, the legend of Scottish cannibal Sawney Bean and the 1978 version of Dawn of the Dead with its comments on consumerism. This film did poorly at the box office due to bad advertising, which is a shame because it's a very well made, well acted and well scripted movie with a cleverly insane soundtrack to boot. Everyone delivers quirky, standout performances, especially Robert Carlyle as the cannibal, playing him as an unhinged Charles Manson type one moment and a cultured, elegant gentleman the next. His performance is totally riveting and shockingly funny at times. He's also incredibly good looking, which doesn't hurt either. Any movie that can fit in a shot of Carlyle's naked butt is a film worth watching. The humor in this movie will not be to everyone's taste (no pun intended). It is still a movie about cannibalism and features some bloody, gross-out gore, so be warned. But, if you have a strong stomach and a sick sense of humor, you won't want to miss this film. 10 stars.

Perhaps it should not have been marketed as a mainstream film. This quirky little film is essentially serious, but has a tone that wobbles into comedy as effortlessly as real life.  The comedy does not make the film any less powerful or disturbing.  I would not be surprised if Antonia Bird is a vegetarian, because the film begins with an absolutely sickening dinner of something like prime rib that the wild editing style makes appear absolutely disgusting.  I went to Old Country Buffet that night and found myself still repulsed by red meat, particularly ribs, after seeing this film, even though the comment about them is spoken by Ives.This film is nowhere near as graphic as I expected it to be, and it moves as swiftly across its running time as _Singin' In the Rain_, ably abetted by a very different form of music, a powerful score by two very different composers (Michael Nyman, one of my favorites, a contemporary classical (minimalist) composer, and Damon Albarn of the rock group Blur, who had previously collaborated on a track for a Noël Coward compilation) which really gets at angles different from what could be presented without it, particularly when Boyd has to choose whether or not to eat to survive.However, the film suffers because of its obligatory death count. Many of the characters, particularly Chaplain Toffler, are quite interesting, but as they start to develop, they are killed.  It almost seems like a statement on how horror films cheat their audiences out of characters that ought to be interesting, but usually aren't.  The fact that so many are killed so early on does not help either.While Pearce manages to be almost an everyman as Boyd, Carlyle delivers a performance that makes Francis Begbie look halfway sane.  Particularly good is how different Colquhoun appears to be from Ives, despite being the same person.  Jeffrey Jones as Hart is even stranger.This film also heralds the return to significance of the title design, although it's a far cry from what Saul Bass was doing.  The visuals of 1870s California (actually shot in Slovakia) are quite beautiful and mark a sharp contrast to the scenes shot in Mexico.  The cinematography and editing are quite brilliant.It deals with ironies of war and survival, but never seems to make a heavyhanded display at any particular point it tries to make.  Instead, it lays things out for the viewer to chew on (pun intended), and does not try to draw attention to the scene that leaves it open for a sequel through its matter-of-fact presentation and no return to the scene at the very end once its shown and instead focuses on its rather poignant final shots.  There is an effort, although not entirely successful, to not play the Indians stereotypically, but it is much better handled with Martha than with her brother, George.This may not have the most profound script, but it is worth a look, particularly during the February-March doldrums of bad theatrical releases. It probably won't win any awards, but its score certainly deserves to, if only there were more effort to promote the album.  It often reminded my of Kubrick's _The Shining_ and Dante's _The Howling_, and is destined to become a classic of the genre.

I mean, I truly LOVE cinema but sometimes you have the face the fact that it can be a pretty hypocrite business from time to time. Especially since the last ten years, everybody complains that there aren't any good horror movies being made. Only uninspired Scream clones and rip-off's. But that is a lie !! There are good and original thriller being made but they just don't get many attention because they are politically incorrect. Ravenous is a perfect example of this. Made in 1999 and it stars a few familiar faces but it went straight to video in my country and I never saw it advertised. That's a real shame because movies like this prove that there are still young directors active who're creative and talented. It's up to the fans to discover movies like this and ignore the overload of mainstream slashers. Ravenous has a very solid plot. simple but effective and supported by terrific acting performances. It shows a few of the darkest aspects of the human mind and, personally, I'm really intrigued by that. Subjects like Cannibalism and ancient Indian mythes are fascinating and when they're placed in a historical setting ( Mexican-American was of 1850 ) it even becomes better. This results in Ravenous being a very atmospheric and tense movie experience that you won't forget easily. The tension is built up slowly ( a bit too slow at first ) and the atmosphere of the cold and lonely Sierra Nevada is being portrayed very well. Guy Pierce is a great choice to play Captain John Boyd. His character is a cowardly figure with a complete lack of authority. He has to go through a battle himself and he's very messed up. The shows is obviously stolen by Robert Carlyle who is used to working with director Antonia Bird. His character is demonic and - duh - ravenous. A terrific performance and Carlyle manages to play his character with a lot of black humor and satanic charisma. David Arquette's role is pretty useless but it was great to see Jeffrey Jones again. Jones is a very decent actor and - even though he's frequently cast by Tim Burton - he's often overlooked and ignored. Ravenous is beautifully shot and some of the effects and make-up is pretty gruesome and explicit. But it isn't just mindless gore and violence so no complaints there. In fact, no complaints at all....Ravenous is a breath-taking movie from beginning till end and a must for anyone who believes that the genre of horror is dead.

He is rewarded with a medal, a promotion to Captain, and a transfer to a lonely outpost in the western Sierra Nevada range in California by a commanding officer who sees the cowardice behind the supposed heroism.  There, a disheveled stranger (Robert Carlyle, doing his best Rasputin impersonation) stumbles into the post, telling a horrible tale of snowbound travellers in a wagon train feeding on each other when their food runs out.  The affable C.O.

Jeremy Davies, who played the nerdy corporal in Saving Private Ryan also appears, playing pretty much the same character.All the parts in this movie were excellent - all the performances were outstanding, the photography and editing were great, and the score was amazing.  However, although I really enjoyed this movie, it didn't add up as be the great film it should have been.

We have a monster in the form of a man who wants most of all to LIVE. As Carlyle's character Colhone/Ives tells it I was dying--tuberculosis, coughing blood up, splitting headaches. I ate, and now!(I'm para phrasing)He isn't EVIL, he's SELFISH in the extreme. Pierce's character, Boyd, ate the flesh once before, and though he survived, and won a sort of heroism in the eyes of his peers, is mortally sinning by wanting to live. HE doesn't wish to live like Ives/Colhone, he wishes to be punished for the act.He's SELF SACRIFICING.The dynamic between the two is epic, deep. Boyd is fascinated and revulsed by Colhone, but hates to admit to himself he's just LIKE Colhone. Colhone, wants Boyd--oh yes, SPOILER HERE- He's got a bit of homosexual feeling for Boyd. The dance they go through is masterfully played out. Neil McDonough(Reiche) is fine as the Soldier of the fort-- his strength and gung ho attitude makes Boyd cowed down before him, and when Reiche yells at him, he actually sighs a deep breath of relief to be taken out of authority! All in all, this film is so much more than a murder/ chiller thriller about cannibals. It is a film about the soul, morality, courage, and how deeply beyond societal rules and moral laws a man will go in the interests of, HIMSELF.

She has crafted a grippingly intense and bizarrely original film, that defies any attempt at pigeonholing or labeling! It is, at times, amusing, often deftly ironic, chillingly irreverent, with moments of intentional political INcorrectness, and ever so subtly feminist at its core.Juxtapositioning, with flawless style and sobering effectiveness, diverse elements of Horror, Period Western, Action-Adventure, Psychodrama, Suspense and the Supernatural, against a backdrop of some of the most breathtakingly dazzling outdoor scenery imaginable(Shot near Durango, Mexico), and set to a perversely inspired musical score that highlights the full potential of music to shape the ambiance of a film and provide the psychological equivalent of running your fingernails across a blackboard!Ms. Bird has managed to coax truly riveting performances from each member of a superb cast! Guy Pearce(L.A.Confidential), starring as Captain Boyd, provides us with an uncannily haunting portrait of a tormented pacifist soldier, in the throws of a fierce struggle for his own soul! Robert Carlyle(Trainspotting) was icily convincing as a fanatically focused, but utterly deranged cannibal in uniform. Jeffrey Jones, in an oddly empathetic change of pace role, played mild-mannered Colonel Hart, plagued by an interminable list of human frailties. Thusly, he is easily subverted by the sinister Ives(Carlyle). Despite all of the aforementioned accolades, I feel I must offer a word of caution Ravenous is undoubtedly NOT suited to everyone's taste! Though it has scarcely a few moments of starkly violent or macabre footage, these moments seem so devastatingly repulsive, that they don't go away easily. Consequently, I'd hesitate to throw out the Welcome Mat on this One!

Here, with only a slight shift &#x97; a very slight shift &#x97; we experience the visceral push in the revulsion of eating flesh.The ability to posit that men inherit the strength and some supernatural powers from those they eat allows the filmmaker to stage brutal fights that make sense. The characters are intensely drawn but using theatrical devices rather than comic book ones, as we have post- Quenten.The thing that makes this for me is the appearance of Pearce and what we know of him from other projects. We allow this more in this film than in others because the physical setup is folks coming from one camp to another remote one. This was right before his Leonard of Memento, which for any cinephile is a touchstone, like the ceiling in Marienbad.And it was after his Felicia in Priscilla, something that reminds us that Australian actors know the internal truth of the ruggedness of the land.Oh, and there is a connection to Marienbad in a way. The score here (in the last half) is what drives this movie. It has to rank as one of the most apt and powerful I know. The composer is Nyman, a sort of Glass but centered in the human rather than the abstract. There is a techno-Gregorian balance here that grabs the part of the soul that moves us forward, but grabs in a way that suggests ghostly presence. The Nyman-Greenaway connection is unavoidable, despite their more recent falling out.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

It is actually a rather interesting hybrid of several different genres.  It's more of a cross between being a dark comedy, a horror movie, a fast-paced thriller, and an old-fashioned westerner.  Set during the 1840s, it stars Pearce as John Boyd, a soldier who has recently been promoted to the rank of Captain after managing to capture an enemy fort.  It is not until a dinner ceremony, that it is discovered that Boyd had cowered at the last minute during battle and watched his fellow soldiers perish before him.  So instead of stripping him of his rank and shooting him for his cowardice, he is sent off to Fort Spencer, which is a small outpost located somewhere in the Sierra-Nevada region.  There he is welcomed by Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), who shows him around and introduces him to everyone.  Boyd is informed that Fort Spencer doesn't receive many visitors during the winter, so during this season, it's run by a loose if not slightly off-beat skeleton crew.  There is Private Toffler (Jeremy Davies) who is sort of a religious fanatic; Major Knox (Stephen Spinella) who's always drunk and is hardly in charge of things; Private Reich (Neal McDonough), the heroic soldier; a pair of local Indians named Martha (Sheila Tousey) and her brother George (Joseph Runningfox); and finally Private Cleaves (David Arquette), who is the cook and provides much of the films humor.  One night, a stranger comes to the fort looking for shelter.  His name is Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle).  He quickly passes out from exhaustion.  He wakes up the next morning and tells the soldiers a rather chilling tale of cannibalism.  This is a great horror film. If it is not a horror film, then it is a savagely amusing comedy.  The performances are excellent.  Guy Pearce doesn't play Boyd as a troubled hero in this movie, as the plot calls for.  He is instead vulnerable and kind of a wimp.  He does have one great scene where he jumps off a cliff. Robert Carlyle plays Colqhoun as a vicious madman who doesn't in my opinion, like killing people, but enjoys the power that comes with it.  Then there is David Arquette's Cleaves.  Despite his small period of time on screen, he does manage to come off as quite an amusing character.  The rest of the cast is great too, especially Neal McDonough's character, Reich.  He plays his character as a lone soldier who does kind of keep to himself, but when he sees fellow soldiers fall, he acts heroically.  Jeffrey Jones' character, Colonel Hart, is one of the people that is easily influenced by Colqhoun.  When we first meet him, he can barely crack open a walnut.  We see that he is weak, old and tired.  After coming under Colqhoun's influences, he finds that he is no longer the feeble man he once was.  He no longer needs to wear glasses and can crush walnuts with his bare hands.This film has a really creepy musical score, which perfectly suits the whole horror-comedy edge of the movie.  The score is just one of the many good things about this movie.  It mostly plays just when something horrific or hilarious is about to happen.  The thumping bass that plays when they go to investigate Colqhoun's story is probably the most eerie.***SPOILERS BELOW***One thing that I have found that this movie tries to tell, is how people influence others.  For example, in the scenes after Colqhoun has killed Hart, Toffler, George, and Reich, Boyd finds himself trapped in a small pit with a broken leg and with Reich's body lying beside him.  Colqhoun ever patiently waits outside to see if Boyd comes out.  What Colqhoun is trying to do is force Boyd into giving into his hunger by eating Reich's body.  Boyd is now faced with two things eat or be eaten.  It eventually comes to the point when Boyd can't take it any longer and is forced to eat the long-dead Reich so he can have the strength to make the long journey back to Fort Spencer.         Then of course, there is the whole issue of the Wendigo myth.  It says that when a man consumes the flesh of another, that he gains their strength and power.  Watch during the end scene where Colqhoun paints a red cross on his forehead and he is chasing after Boyd.  This is meant to symbolize that Colqhoun thinks that he is God, or at least a higher force above any normal man.  He thinks that because he has killed so many men and gained their strengths, that he is all powerful.  To me, this fact is disturbingly true.  Colqhoun during this scene, is virtually unstoppable.  He has already had part of a building collapse on him, he's been shot and now he's stuck in a bear trap with Boyd.  Colqhoun tells Boyd, that in order for him (Boyd) to survive, he will have to eat him (Colqhoun) when he dies.  Then he says that he (Colqhoun) will eat Boyd if he dies first.  This whole God-like persona that I was talking about earlier ties into the Wendigo myth - Colqhoun is a monster.***END OF SPOILERS***This film never ceases to amaze me.  This movie is going to become a cult classic in a few years, so don't be surprised.

This picture, about a 19th-century U.S. cavalry officer who runs afoul of super-powered cannibals in a remote outpost in California, aspires to be many things  a gruesome horror flick, a period picture, a black satire, a commentary on the truly depraved ends to which man will sometimes go in order to achieve his often rapacious ends.  That's a lot for any one film to put on its plate (pardon the pun), and Ravenous admittedly succeeds better at achieving some of its goals than others.It's 1847, and John Boyd (Guy Pearce) has just been decorated as a Mexican War hero.  His heroism was actually based on cowardice and happenstance; he lay down in fear on the battlefield, was taken for dead, and an accidental taste of his fallen comrades' blood roused him to a one-man counterattack. Boyd the hero is a fraud.  His commander knows it, and sends him where he thinks he'll do the least damage.  This is Fort Spencer, where a ragtag band of troops wait to guide new settlers to the Nevadas.  One night, a depraved, near-naked man arrives at the fort.  His name is Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle), and he has a grim story to tell, a story of a trapped traveling party and the extreme means they adopted to survive their three months of imprisonment in a mountain cave.  The soldiers set out to find any survivors, but Colqhoun soon reveals his true colors.  He is possessed by the spell of the wendigo, a Native American myth by which the consumption of human flesh imbues one with superhuman powers.  The monstrous Colqhoun targets the men, especially Boyd, to join him in creating an army of cannibal supermen who will realize Manifest Destiny...with a vengeance.  Those who don't comply...well, a man's gotta eat.This description may make Ravenous sound like a Saturday-matinee trashfest, but Ted Griffin's screenplay is surprisingly ambitious.  He makes Colqhoun's taste for flesh mirror his desire for power, and by setting the film at an outpost on territory acquired by the U.S. in a war against its Mexican natives (an outpost, I might add, maintained for the white soldiers by Indians), it reminds us that the American Dream has often been won by the blood of others whose own dreams were snuffed out.  Heady stuff, made all the more potent by its inspiration in the Donner Party tragedy, a real-life story of people who came to America seeking their dreams...and finding only a nightmare.Still, this is all subtext.  How does Ravenous play on the surface? Well, it blows hot and cold.  The cast does competent work, and director Antonia Byrd milks the big moments of action for all they're worth.  The film has a nice, authentic look, with cold-parched rocks and the rickety fort invading the serenity of the wilderness.  Michael Nyman collaborates with Damian Albarn on a bizarrely effective score that sounds like a mix of sea shantey and the Friday the 13th theme played on banjo and squeeze box.  Even the moments of gore are well-handled, giving us suggestive (though really very graphic) glimpses of atrocities that help to build Colqhoun's villainous status in our minds.I think the film's one real mistake is the inclusion of too many ill- conceived attempts at humor.  They work when they're kept pitch-black (like the stomach-turning banquet that opens the film), but when the fort's second in command, Knox (Stephen Spinella) is stumbling around drunk half the time and Private Cleaves (David Arquette) is stoned whenever Knox isn't drunk, it's just distracting.  I think that if played a little more straight, with the humorous asides saved for when they're most inappropriate, Byrd and Griffin might have had a morbid little masterpiece on their hands.As it stands, Ravenous is a perfectly respectable entertainment.  It's a good-looking, generally well-made film that serves up plenty of action, amusing moments, and just enough thematic depth to provide something meaty to digest on the way back to the video store.Again, pardon the pun.

It appears to be a horror and a thriller but, while it does contain some guts and suspense, the film is much more than a generic horror. Ravenous has elements of adventure and some black comedy in quirky moments, more so in the first half, and thrills that are more-so concept and emotionally based rather than cheap adrenalin. The point is that it's a bad idea going into this film because you heard it was a picking-off-the-victims gore-fest.The film begins with events following soon after the Mexican-American War where Second Lieutenant (John) Boyd (Guy Pearce) is struggling after letting his unit down while they are massacred. He stumbled into the Mexican headquarters and, in a bout of bravery, managed to capture enemy command from within. He is haunted by images and flashbacks of the mass of deaths and aggression he has witnessed. Boyd is promoted to Captain for his heroism, but his commanding officer discovers the cowardly truth of this victory. Boyd is exiled to Fort Spencer in the Sierra Nevada. Boyd settles in with 7 interesting residents of Fort Spencer. Soon they're all introduced to a man who shows up in the night weak and injured. He proceeds to explain to them a disturbing account of his group turning to cannibalism having him flee in fear of his life and the Spencer team setting off with him venturing back in obligation to the cave which he has fled to save a woman he admits he has left alone in danger.Apart from the events that take place in the film, the situation John Boyd finds himself in is a reflection of honest morality with a front focus on temptation and the will power not to give in. It is really a matter of opinion whether this is appealing, which is is for me, but it really doesn't hurt for one to open their mind.Ravenous can get you to think if you let it do so.

A short list of replacements was quickly contacted, and after several refusals, Antonia Bird (PRIEST) was hired to step in, partially at the suggestion of actor Robert Carlyle, who had worked with her on that film.Hence, the schizophrenic tone that the movie establishes from the get-go is kind of off-putting. The closest approximation I can come up with? Think of SWEENEY TODD sans Mrs. Lovett, cross-pollenated with a comedic take on the Donner party incident, directed by Dario Argento and scored by his favorite composer, Ennio Morricone. Bird's style of direction is similar with the way the gore sequences are shot, and the split of scoring chores between THE PIANO'S Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn produces something every bit as unique and affecting as any of Morricone's scores for Argento.With the film's unfortunately troubled history, the cast and director seem to have a tough time deciding whether this is more of a comedy or a horror film, the end result being that the viewer's feelings about it end up being more split than a lot of the bodies that end up sliced, diced and consumed through the course of the movie. Some commentary that links the American hunger for the consumption of the New Frontier to today's rampant materialism and consumerism is attempted, then suddenly dropped as if screenwriter Ted Hughes decided to say Oh, never mind right in the middle of the proceedings.At least an attractive (and tasty) cast makes it worth an evening. Captain Boyd (PEARCE), a disgraced war hero in the Spanish-American conflict is promoted to Fort Spencer , manned by a 'skeletal' regiment commanded by Jeffrey Jones (AMADEUS), deep in the mountains of California. He finds most of the staff bored to the brink of insanity, where a few members have actually gone over a long time ago, especially the character played by Arquette (he of SCREAM fame.)Things don't really start to get ultimately interesting or nasty until the arrival of F.W. Colquohon, (Carlyle), who stumbles into the Fort almost dead. Upon his revival, he graces them with a tale that just about rivals the Donner party's experiences, and has the men scurrying to make a foolhardy rescue attempt of a couple of alleged survivors. Throw in some Native American mythology about flesh-eating daemons, add a some of INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE'S moral ambiguities and stir well.RAVENOUS wants to be all things at once and eventually ends up failing at most of them. However there are tasty morsels floating around that indicate what a true feast this movie could've been the just-barely-restrained performances of Carlyle and Jones; the tangy, twangy score that is as unique to this film as violin screeches are to Hermann's PSYCHO, the period setting adorned with touches of post-modern culture, (the prodigious drug use of Arquette's character; the neo-Adam Durvitz 'do sported by Pearce).Not a flick I'd recommend to the even-slightly squeamish, RAVENOUS probably has a bright future as a cult film amongst gorehounds, guilty pleasure buffs and MTV addicts.

Annoying scene number two is the Pearce/Carlyle battle where each takes to headbutting the other one for about five minutes when both carry rather large, and extra sharp weapons.

It's an enjoyable and well crafted story that seems to run out of inspiration and falls back on a more conventional and contrived narrative.Captain John Boyd (Guy Pierce) is a U.S. Army hero of the Mexican-American War. There's a dark secret to his heroism, though, and that results in Boyd being exiled to the remote Fort Spencer in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains. He arrives in winter and joins the rag-tag, skeleton crew that keeps watch over the fort until the regular compliment of soldiers returns in the spring. Boyd's commanding officer, Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), is a wearied intellectual. Private Toffler (Jeremy Davies) is extremely religious and somewhat touched in the head. Pvt. Cleaves (David Arquette) is the mid-19th century's version of a dope head. Pvt. Reich (Neal McDonough) is a seething wave of violence waiting to be unleashed. Major Knox (Stephen Spinella) is the stereotypically drunken Southern gentleman. Martha and George (Shelia Tousey and Joseph Running Fox) are taciturn Indian siblings and the fort's resident trackers and guides. This motley crew then sees a stranger named Colghoun (Robert Carlyle) stumble into Fort Spencer with word of a wagon train of settlers that ran into tragedy and cannibalism. Boyd, Hart, Reich, Toffler and George set out to see if they can rescue the survivors. Colghoun comes along to show them the way, but what he leads them to turns out to be worse than any of them imagined.Ravenous is a clever and intriguing film that aspires to add a new member to the monster movie genre. In this case, it would be an ancient Indian creature called the Wendigo. In the legend, when a man eats the flesh of another man in the wilderness, he gains his victim's strength and spirit but he only exacerbates the unholy hunger inside. Writer Ted Griffin and director Antonia Bird do a very fine job bringing that myth to disturbing life on screen. But after starting with something new and different, it's like these filmmakers lose interest in what they've created and Ravenous turns into something that would be familiar to anyone who's a fan of vampire movies. From shocking and unsettling, the story devolves to predictably suspenseful and unsurprisingly creepy. It's not bad, but it is like you're suddenly watching a different story.If you're not thrown off by that, there's a lot even those who aren't fans of horror movies can like about this film. Aside from a questionably ironic choice of music for one scene, Bird has a good eye as a director and a firm grasp on her storytelling. She and Griffen clearly but unobtrusively established who the characters are and then have those characters serve to advance the story in different ways. Guy Pierce doesn't show much more than that he's really good at brooding, but both Jeffrey Jones and Neal McDonough bring a genuine depth to their roles. Robert Carlyle's performance is a bit disjointed, but that's what his role calls for. And even as the story resorts to well-known vampiric tropes, it still manages to throw some honest surprises at you.There is a point where the film starts making some blatant political commentary on American expansionism and Manifest Destiny, but it's either too dated or too timid to have any resonance. And while criticism of America's desire to consume more and more fits the cannibalistic Wendigo, it makes less sense the more the story starts to be about vampires.Ravenous is a horror movie with a brain. It promises to be smarter than it actually turns out to be but given the pitifully low IQ of most of this genre, it's hard to hold that against it.

The classic black-and-white Night of the Living Dead from 30 years ago was much creepier in the chomping human flesh department.  Robert Carlyle was suitably demonic as Ives, but Guy Pearce spent most of his screen time looking attractively forlorn.  Flattering camera work helped him pull that off rather nicely, but LA Confidential it wasn't.  Nor Priscilla, for that matter.  Several other featured actors, David Arquette and Stephen Spinella included, had roles that were essentially cameos.

It stars Guy Pearce, Robert Carlyle, Jeremy Davies, Jeffrey Jones, David Arquette and Neal McDonough. Music is by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn and cinematography by Anthony B.

Colqhoun (Carlyle) wanders into the Fort&#x85;A box office flop, a troubled production and a weirdness that permeates the narrative and technical credits, would indicate Ravenous as being a potential stinker to steer clear of? Not so though. For a good many film fans will tell you that many of the critics and paying customers of the time just didn't get it, they wasn't prepared to work out the tone and unique vibe of the whole thing.Ravenous is gloriously unique, there's an unpredictability about the film right from the off. From the very first strains of a deliciously oblique music score, to the cracker-jack finale, Ravenous is content to toy with your expectations, to tickle your funny bone, yet to also turn your stomach in an instant.Atmosphere is everything to a film like this, and Ravenous has it in spades, it's claustrophobic in its eeriness, yet visually it's also stunning, where Richmond's photography brings the beauty of the Tara Mountains to life one minute, then mutes the colours the next when the human beings take centre stage and the thematic of plotting unfolds.Characterisations are deliberately off-kilter, as are a couple of key scenes, while performances are splendidly in tune with the material to hand (Carlyle is just great and revelling in playing such a tasty role). Bird, who stepped in at the last minute, does a fine job of blending the dangling threads of three genres, she keeps it tense but knows exactly when to pause to filter in some darkly comic beats.Undeniably the last third is not up to the standard of what has gone before, tight atmospherics and edgy period promise give way to something more conventional in horror parlance terms. So yes! It's not the perfect meal at all, but it's darn near gourmet stuff and once sampled, Ravenous leaves a lasting and favourable taste on the tongue. 8/10 "},{"Title":"Well crafted horror but definitely not for the faint of heart...","Date":"21 February 2008","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Just came across this one while surfing the net and it had me hooked from the first few scenes, although I missed the start of the film. Knowing the subject matter, I thought I'd be changing the channel on my remote after a quick glimpse, but stayed with it, largely due to the presence of GUY PEARCE in one of the leading roles.It's a pretty intense experience and what incredibly demanding roles physically for Pearce and ROBERT CARLYLE, as the maniacal man addicted to human flesh. The scene where Pearce jumps off a cliff to escape the clutches of the man in hot pursuit of killing him, is incredibly filmed. The stunt men on this one certainly earned their pay, since two of the men were involved in spectacular falls in what has to be one of the most brilliant tracking shots I've ever seen, capturing every moment of the action.But the most punishment goes to the viewer able to stick with the film to the bloody finish. It's relentlessly gory and gets darker as the story progresses from one unpredictable scene to another, in what amounts to a virtual overkill (pun intended), even for a horror movie fan.If you can handle the gruesome subject, it's a well-crafted film in every other respect--never boring and moving swiftly to the final physical confrontation between Pearce and Carlyle. Good work by David ARQUETTE and NEAL McDONOUGH makes for a very compelling film that is not the sort one expects to find in the horror genre.The only real flaw is that it would be physically impossible for two men to summon enough strength to fight each other given the wounds they suffered and inflicted on each other. Carlyle and Pearce kept coming back from each deathly encounter like Jason in Friday the 13th. Perhaps this was intentional on the part of the director to give the film a touch of black humor amidst the horror.I'll say one thing for Pearce. He certainly knows how to pick offbeat roles, judging from the number of quirky independent films on his resume.

What raises it above the ordinary? Well for a start there's the nice touch of not only making the &#145;hero' (Capt. John Boyd) a coward, but in refusing to fully resolve the issue of his cowardice (or his fear of death).Then, of course, there's Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn's delightfully playful/disturbing score. Music in horror is so often used to build tension and convey dread in such a cliched and overly familiar way that any twist on the formula is most welcome indeed. Some may have found the &#145;jolly' banjo music accompanying Ives's pursuit of Toffler somewhat silly and &#145;out of place', but it is this very incongruity which makes it so enjoyable for me. It throws the audience an unexpected musical cue and lends the scene an appropriate and delicious grotesqueness. In addition, there are numerous interesting and provocative themes thrown up amidst the gore and despair. Man's never-ending search for different forms of escape; the analogy between Ives's cannibalistic fervour and the coming Western expansion that would consume and devour everything in its path; cannibalism/capitalism crossovers etc. Finally, there's the sheer pleasure of watching black, black comedy horror of the highest order being performed by a cast of fine, able, intelligent actors. Horror these days can be so formulaic and can take itself so seriously, that one longs for a bit of gruesome, gleeful, twisted, inventive fun. Hats off to the filmmakers and actors for delivering the meaty goods to a starving horror audience.

The script and dialogue is very good and there are a few very surprising twists in the story with an excellent macabre taste to them.   The sets are atmospheric and believable, the costumes look lived-in and the music (by the guy who did Clint's spaghetti westerns) is weird and slightly unsettling, but this I find strangely apt.Any fan of gothic horror and old Hammer Horror would probably enjoy this film.

Also one of the funniest black comedies of all time. It's funny the same way Fargo is. In fact, if the Coen Brothers ever returned to their thriller roots, or made a straight up horror, this is the type of movie they might end up with.This AV Club blurb does a spot on job of conveying why this movie is so good.It may be hard to believe now, but once upon a time &#x97; call it the late Nineties &#x97; a major movie studio sunk $12 million into a comedic western about 19th century soldiers who believed eating other humans endow folks with superhuman strength and the ability to recover from life- threatening injuries. When shooting on the film crashed to a halt after three weeks of interference and executive micromanaging, one of the suits at at 20th Century Fox hit upon an idea fire director Milcho Manchevski &#x97; the Macedonian art house sensation whose devastating wartime romance Before the Rain was nominated for an Oscar &#x97; and replace him with Raja Gosnell, whose only feature credit to date was Home Alone 3. Shockingly, it didn't work out.The cast, lead by Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle (fresh off his BAFTA-winning performance in The Full Monty), rejected Gosnell like a body denying a transplanted heart, and Ziskin's filmmaker of choice returned to the comforts of his wheelhouse in Los Angeles, where he would promptly get to work on Never Been Kissed. Carlyle eventually pressured Fox into filling the director's chair with his trusted collaborator, Antonia Bird, a veteran of British TV whose best known feature on these shores was Priest, about a closeted man of the cloth. It did not sound like an ideal match- up. Shockingly, it turned out great.Ravenous is a film that, by design, was forced to thread the needle between three different genres, a challenge that few directors have the finesse to overcome under normal circumstances &#x97; let alone on a project that had more cooks in the kitchen than it did carnivores on screen. Kicking off with the twang of a banjo that might not have been tuned since 1846, this Mulligan's stew of a movie walks such a fine line between bleak comedy (He was licking me!), hyper- violent survival drama, and supernatural creature-feature that the guy narrating the trailer seems to have no idea what he's actually selling. Advertising lies all the time, but seldom is it so confused One man must choose between having dinner, and being dinner&#x85; (You wait for him to follow that oddly jokey declaration up with I guess?) Audiences of the time can hardly be blamed for not being sold.But while many studio boondoggles betray the messiness of their making (Fantastic Four, anyone?), this ragged, unsung 1999 gem was one of the very few that was able to feed off the chaos. An origin story about the American spirit, the film is a lot like America itself a melting pot of disparate elements, thrown together in a fit of violence, and galvanized by the righteous illusion that this is how God intended it to be.Subtlety is not on the menu here, and it's easy to imagine how the bluntness of the script by Ted Griffin (Ocean's 11) helped it weather the constant assault of studio notes and creative upheaval. The story begins by introducing us to Second Lieutenant John Boyd (Guy Pearce), a Mexican- American War vet who's being promoted to Captain after killing an entire unit of enemy soldiers on their own turf. The problem is that, after playing dead and being stacked in a heap of corpses, our hero was only capable of such battlefield bravery because of an unsettling jolt of strength &#x97; which he got from drinking trickling-down blood. Boyd is now nauseated at the sight of raw meat; he pukes behind a tent after a celebratory banquet as the title card flashes on screen. Laughs are usually the first things that get lost when a movie is Frankensteined together, but the film's sick sense of humor remained intact.Surprisingly, a story that rubs our faces in America's ongoing history of cannibalism (cultural, commercial, or otherwise) is always going to be a tough sell in a country that still celebrates Columbus Day. Ravenous bombed at the box office, grossing $10 million less than it cost to make and anticipating a climate where a film like this would be lucky to premiere at Fantastic Fest in advance of a straight-to-VOD release. Perhaps that's for the best. A major studio trying to wrangle something so bloodthirsty and off-kilter is like a child trying to raise a feral hyena &#x97; it's too wild to tame, and it's always laughing at you for trying.But maybe this movie isn't quite as bleak as it appeared at the time; maybe this is just a case of not being able to see the forest for the trees. For all of its nihilism, this perverse take on the weird, weird West digs so deep into the darkness that it eventually shines a light out through other side. Like Colqhoun, it knows that we have to face the truth &#x97; and like Boyd, it knows that doesn't mean we have to live with it. To quote the film's opening title card, it's never too late to say Eat me.

I won't even bother giving my usual rant about it being underrated because honestly, it's a hard sell. The casual moviegoer would be hard pressed to grab it off the shelf and think they're in for a fun Friday night. But they would be. It boasts a wickedly funny, extremely gory horror comedy vibe that's just unbeatable. Guy Pearce is excellent as a soldier who survived and triumphed in the Mexican American war by playing dead and infiltrating his enemies quarters as a corpse. Labelled a coward by his bear of a superior (John Spencer) he finds himself exiled to a snowy mountain outpost, presided over by an unruly band of misfits. It's not long before a mysterious stranger (Robert Carlyle) stumbles out of the night with a horrifying tale of brutal murder and cannibalism, leaving him the sole survivor. The outpost leader organizes a search party to the alleged cave where this takes place, and from there the film takes a gloriously demented detour into a supremely weird, devilishly entertaining fight for survival. The musical score is completely opposite of what the synopsis suggests, a haunting jangly tune that suggest nothing of the outright atrocities to come, making the film all the more memorable. Carlyle is a slippery fiend, nailing a role that's tricky to pull off, with glee and malice at every turn. The always welcome Jeffrey Jones steals the show as the outpost leader, a chatterbox good ol boy who brightens every scene he's in, and old pro Jones takes the wicked funny script and dances circles with it. David Arquette randomly shows up as a peyote loving mountain man, and Jeremy Davies and Neal McDonough have a nice bits too. Whatever problems the director had with the studio is none of my business.

One of the biggest problems with this one is the main villain himself, who is presented as such a completely unimposing physical presence that he could very easily be physically overpowered that his rants and raving don't really hold that much weight to them. On top of all that, he seems so twitchy and paranoid that there's very little reason to believe anything he's saying, and the tent encounter on the trek up to the trail should've been another giveaway of his true intentions. Likewise, there's one big problem here in the film asking us to take the side of someone of such reprehensible mortality and ethics by presenting him as the good-natured hero of the piece for all his time spent doling out those speeches and painting in a good light throughout which is really distressing. On top of the problems with him, the film is just plodding and dull during the latter half here which really tends to lower this one by featuring such bland scenes of the two slaughtering through the reserves on the base only to turn it into a philosophical battle about the morality of what they're doing rather than actively doing anything interesting as they're along at the fort, the perfect opportunity to engage in some rather than getting involved with some nice action. There's enough wrong here with all these factors for it to override the few good parts here. The main one is the initial recovery of the stranger and the subsequent expedition sent out based on his story, which has a lot of intriguing elements and lots of action the story is certainly chilling and sends them out in the woods appropriately, the journey there is fine and the darker path it takes following the revelations in the cave lead to the extended, thrilling chase scenes through the woods where they get face- to-face in several rather enjoyable encounters. The only other enjoyable facet here is the extremely fun, brutal and drawn-out finale confrontation where the bloodied combatants brawl throughout the fort which is quite an enjoyable and exciting scene that's more action-packed than anything else in the film, but is not enough to help this against the flaws.Rated R Graphic Violence, Language, Brief rear Nudity, strong themes of cannibalism and mild drug use.

The central moral dilemma (self-sacrifice vs. exploitation of others) and the basic plot line (an evil infiltrates a predominantly male wilderness outpost where a flawed hero has come to atone for his sins) have been beaten to death in everything from horror movies to war films and westerns. But it's the quirky performances, the bleak scenery, the effective cutting and above all the unforgettable soundtrack by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn that infuse this movie with a particular kind of unique weirdness. I can still remember the first time I saw Ravenous, rented at a video place on a whim because the box seemed interesting. When the end titles ran out, with a reprise of the main musical theme that keeps appearing in different variations as the story progresses, I was left literally speechless, and at that point I couldn't even tell what the big deal was.Now, after a good decade and a half of repeat viewings, all I can offer is the impression that the movie pulls off what few do - it manages to be strange, grotesque and gruesome, but moving at the same time. And again, it must be the texture rather than the content that makes it so. The only other piece of storytelling with a similar approach to human wickedness and frailty (and kindness, too) that comes to mind is Deadwood, another unique viewing experience, and a western of sorts but not really.

It's an interesting film for sure, but also one that's all over the place tonally.I understand that the film's original director quit for whatever reason, so Robert Carlyle suggested Antonia Bird for the role. Bird and Carlyle had previously worked together on the excellent low budget British crime film FACE, so the choice seemed a good one, but I'm not sure that Bird was quite right for this material. Although RAVENOUS is extremely gory, it's never in the least bit horrific, while the attempts at black comedy aren't all that successful.Instead what we have is an action-focused story of survival, loaded with gore effects and general nastiness. RAVENOUS is worth watching thanks to the sterling efforts of a great little cast, headlined by Guy Pearce back when he was just starting out in Hollywood. Robert Carlyle makes for a great psychotic bad guy as always, and the casting director has done a good job for interesting character actors the creepy Jeffrey Jones, Neal McDonough, and Jeremy Davies.

It's basically a movie of survival and asks the question of how far would a person go to stay alive.Guy Pearce as Capt. John Boyd and Robert Carlyle as Colqhoun are undoubtedly the stars of the movie with Carlyle bringing a real menace and calculating nature to his character.The only real downside to the movie is the occasionally annoying music, which at times sounds like a cat being neutered without anesthetic.

Shortly after arriving and meeting the soldiers who live there, a wandering man shows up, near death, and he has a disturbing story to tell.As disgusting and unsettling as this movie is, I recognize that that is director Antonia Bird's goal, and she succeeds. This movie is just plain creepy, and while the film's content may seem like it makes that a given, history has shown us that it takes skill to make anything creepy. The atmosphere is subtle, but still unsettling. Bird makes great use of the mountain vistas, turning them from beautiful to isolating. The cinematography is top-notch, bringing to mind movies from the Technicolor age.Bird is given a talented, if eclectic, cast to work with. Guy Pearce is very good at portraying wounded and weary characters, and that makes him a solid choice as Boyd. Robert Carlyle is clearly enjoying himself as the off-the-wall Calhoun, the mysterious visitor. Jeffrey Jones makes the most of a relatively important role, something the noted character actor is rarely given. David Arquette, despite being highly credited, has a very small role with almost nothing to do. Neal McDonough is also good, bearing a striking similarity to Paul Walker.There are some problems with the film, however. The film sometimes becomes a little too offbeat for its own good (for example, there's one creepy sequence that suddenly turns into a lighthearted romp for no apparent reason). Also, the attempts at gallows humor to lighten things up (what attempts there are) just aren't that funny.As you can imagine, this is a violent and extremely gory film (an NC-17 rating would have been warranted). But if you want to get creeped out, this will do the trick, if you have the desire to see this film.My rating NC-17 for pervasive aberrant and violent content including graphic images and gore.

I might hesitate to join the man for a meal in real life, if I ever had the chance! He's just that good. There ensues murder and mayhem, of which Guy Pearce is the only survivor. But (long story short) he, too, finds himself resorting to cannibalism to save himself and return to the Fort, where he tries in vain to convince others that colquhoun (who now goes by Colonel Ives) is a cannibalistic murderer. There follow several scenes, some of them strangely sexually charged, of Ives trying to convince Pearce's character to give in to his temptation to continue eating human flesh. I suppose that, like vampirism, there is something sexual, in a forbidden way, in the idea, if not the actual practice, of cannibalism.There ensues a fight to the death . . . but no, I won't tell how it turns out. Just watch this brilliantly written and acted, darkly humorous little gem.Cheers.

It is not the type of film I usually watch but after 10 minutes, I was hooked and I stayed like that till the very end.The first part of the film is about Captain John Boyd played by Guy Pearce who has been sent to a broken down army fort in Sierra Nevada in the 1800s. The reason is his act of cowardice in the Mexican-American war of 1847. The fort is manned by a small gang of soldiers and officers who are the dregs of the army and have all been tucked away as if they are an embarrassment for the army. These are Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones), Pvt. Cleaves (David Arquette), Knox (Stephen Spinella), Pvt Reich (Neal McDonough), Pvt. Toffler (Jeremy Davies) and two Indian siblings George (Joseph Runningfox) and Martha (Sheila Tousey).They are soon confronted by the horror from the outside world when Robert Carlyle (Ives/Colqhoun) turns up, frozen and sick. The film moves from an ordinary movie about the soldiers having to deal with the harshness of life on a run down fort in the middle of winter and into something entirely different. A story about murder and cannibalism. Carlyle, when he first shows up acts like the victim and says that there might be a survivor and the soldiers have no choice but to go and look for themselves but they are too late and as a result they are killed by Ives accept Boyd who in desperation has to eat Pvt. Reich to get back to the fort.The next part of the film is Boyd trying to make Martha, Pvt. Cleaves, Knox and Gen. Slauson (John Spencer) to believe his wild story to them but to us, we are in the same situation as Boyd because we have seen what Ives has done and we know he is the madman not Boyd but Ives is clever and never is suspected of any wrong doing. The irony is everyone thinks Boyd is mad and won't listen to him and we see Boyd having to deal with everyone's suspicion that he has something to do with the murders of the soldiers and we also see his fight within himself, to resist the temptation of eating human flesh again.At the end, Boyd decides to kill Ives to stop the madness and in the end knows the only way he is going to do that is to kill himself as well which we see when he is trying to find Ives and comes across a trap device. Boyd certainly thinks the murder and cannibalism will be stopped if they are both dead and no-one else is infected with the hunger for human flesh but we see at the end, Ives has left a pot on and Gen. Slauson tries it and then keeps on trying it and the audience is left to wonder if he will turn into the type of addicted person who won't be able to stop eating human flesh and will hunger for it like Ives and Boyd.The film is brilliant. It has many twists and turns which you don't see till they are upon you. The actors make the film compelling especially Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle. Pearce gives Boyd intensity and vulnerability. Carlyle shows Ives as a man who doesn't think he is doing anything wrong and blinded by the benefits of his physical health from eating human flesh but who doesn't see himself as a madman, just someone who is trying to survive.Special mention should go to Antonia Bird who kept me permanently on the edge of my seat. Damon Alburn and Michael Nyman whose music worked well with the visual images to add to the tension. The Cinnematography by Anthony B. Richmond and Film Editing by Neil Farrell that adds to suspense of the film.

Little did he know that his post-war-life would send him down a stranger and more macabre path than he would ever dare imagine.Ravenous is like an odd Vampire story. The same elements seem to be there the unwitting, unwilling recruit, the unnatural strength that comes from the ingestion of human blood(in this case, meat and all), and the eternal struggle of good vs. evil. However, I must admit that I'm not the biggest vampire film fan, but I loved Ravenous. That's because while it's sort of LIKE a vamp flick, it's really not in a lot of ways too.Ravenous is sometimes scary, often startling, and once in awhile downright funny. The acting is well done all around, especially from Robert Carlyle and Guy Pearce. It's a good time, and it's sure to make the viewer turn from the TV in disgust more than once, and that is what makes it great. This odd and unsettling story does more for the avid movie buff with a taste for the thrilling and bizarre than wet the appetite, it makes them truly...Ravenous.

Your digested popcorn may just return to you but you will be plenty entertained.  It is a truly strange movie with everything including the kitchen sink thrown in but somehow it manages to work.  Much has been made about the music being oddly out of place and I would agree that the score works well at times and misses at others.  The cinematography effectively conveys a sense of doomed isolation. The acting by Jeffrey Jones is great.  Jeremy Davies and David Arquette are both funny in essentially one note performances.  Guy Pearce is okay - a little over the top, but I guess that's the point.  For me, it's all about Robert Carlyle.  He reminds me of Gary Oldman in that, despite being a physically scrawny and unimposing guy, he is able to convey intensity and menace far beyond his size.  Don't take it seriously, don't eat beforehand and have you'll have a blast.

The acting is of a high standard, especially Robert Carlyle as the one minute crazed, the next minute respectable, cannibal. Guy Pearce, who was excellent in LA Confidential, is also good as the moralistic straight guy in opposition to Carlyle's deranged character. The film keeps you interested from the start and maintains that interest throughout, even though the ending was a little farcical. It's never going to be considered a classic but If you like an intelligent film, and don't want to think too much, this film is for you. Very much a cult movie.  "},{"Title":"HE WAS LICKING ME!!!!!","Date":"29 May 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Spoilers aheadThis film is first and foremost a curiousity piece. It probably won't appeal to the 14 year old at the Iowa drive-in (the standard audience that all films seem to be aimed at these days).Too quirky for real horror and too low budget for a blockbuster, it combines terror, suspense and humour, and, brilliantly, manages to combine a feeling of the vast wilderness of the American West with a claustrophobic, almost stagey feel. In fact, the interaction of the characters is such that you almost could perform this on the stage in one setting. The obviously zero budget does not make it feel 'cheap' either. The setting is unusual and superb. Post-revolutionary, pre-civil war America is a period rarely shown on screen and it was a delight to see the period uniforms and even an attempt at period speech by the actors.And as for the cave scene - that is probably one of the scariest scenes I have seen for a while. While Ives borders on a pantomime villain, Colhoun is sh*t-scarey and the scene where he goes bananas outside the cave had me quivering with fear. That definitely should have been used in the theatrical trailer as well as the 'Let's get that b*stard' scene.Overall it's too quirky for my liking to be a satisfactory thriller, especially in the final scenes.

Some liked it, while some hated it. When I read the description for it, I realized that this was a movie I simply had to watch to decide myself. But I didn't really go out on a great quest to find it. I just thought about it sometimes. Had I seen it in the stores I would have rented it, or bought it. But I never did. So one day, my sister came home with a bunch of horror movies she had rented, and one of them happened to be Ravenous. I decided to watch it, but I wasn't overly excited about it.When I started it up, however, it soon struck me This is one of the few movies that had ever kept me on the edge of my seat. All the time.The story follows an officer in the American-Mexican war. In 1847, Boyd is promoted to captain due to heroics in combat. However, a colonel realizes that it wasn't actually heroices, it was cowardice that opened up the opportunity that presented itself to Boyd. After Boyd's promotion, the Colonel sends Boyd as far away as possible To Fort Spencer somewhere in Califorina. A drop-by point for travelers on their way to Sierra Nevada. It is in the middle of the winter, and the landscape is covered with snow. Add to that, the fort has only eight inhabitants, including Boyd, and is almost completely isolated from the outside world.One dark night, a stranger finds his way to the fort. He is in very bad shape and they take him in to give him food and such. Once the stranger wakes up, he tells them that his name is Colqhoun, and is a servant of god. He then tells them his tale. It's a terrifying tale about how Colqhouns caravan was lost in the mountains, and forced to seek shelter in a cave. This is where the horror starts, as it appears one in Colqhouns company has an undying thirst for human flesh.I won't tell you anything else of the story, other than that it's fantastic. In fact, it was so bizarre, twisted, original and amazing that first I thought it must have been an adapted screenplay from some horror novel. I checked it out, and no; It was an original piece by Ted Griffin. Any man who could conceive a story like this is simply marvelous. But it's not all thanks to him, as the director Antonia Bird has finetuned the story with his own direction and such. The soundtrack is chilling and eerie. It's nothing like I've ever heard before. The atmosphere is among the best I've ever experienced. I dare to say, that this is in fact the best horror film I have ever seen. If you're a fan of movies, you owe it to yourself to immediately go and get a copy of this film. Don't make my mistake. Don't wait. Go see it now.10/10  "},{"Title":"not quite cult, not quite A-list...","Date":"16 March 2004","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Here's one of those odd movies that has a decent budget and some major stars, but is so bizarre that mainstream success proved elusive.  It's neither a B nor an A movie - it sits weirdly in between those two categories.  Though no one, in the entire Universe, actually saw it at the time of release, it seems to have developed a following now...but does it deserve a resurgence of popularity, or was it rightly buried?Tough for me to judge this one objectively; I saw it after eating at a meat-only buffet and had to make a conscious effort not to vomit, as the proceedings here are quite gross indeed.  However, the film boasts some beautiful locations and a totally whacked-out and wonderful music score.  The performances are pretty solid, too; Jeffrey Jones in particular is a standout, and when he disappears for a while, the movie certainly suffers.  And the central concept, revolting though it may be, is compelling.  Whereas cannibalism is merely a gross and ultimately inexplicable element of most zombie films, here it is given a practical and mythological context.  So that's cool.I like period pieces and horror movies, but the crossing of these two genres is, for some reason, rarely successful.  Ravenous is one of the best of this strange hybrid bunch.  A few forays into twentieth century lingo and sensibilities drag the movie down a bit, but on the whole it has good atmosphere and some actual credibility.  But of course, both horror and historical movies are capable of better.

I saw it the first time when it was originally released, and had forgotten what a great movie it is!This thing sucked me in right from the get-go. It spends about 15 minutes on exposition and character introduction, and then gets right to the...if you'll excuse the expression...meat of the film. The movie takes place during the Spanish-American War, and concerns a Captain John Boyd (Guy Pearce), who is assigned to Fort Spencer, an isolated outpost in the western Sierra Nevada Mountains. He arrives in the dead of winter to find that he one in a company of only eight people inhabiting the fort (it's the off season, apparently).Soon after Boyd's arrival, another visitor arrives at Fort Spencer a Mr. F.W. Calhoun (Robert Carlyle). He is the last survivor of a party of pioneers who got lost in the mountains, and were forced to take shelter in a cave from a winter storm; a storm that left them snowed in and unable to continue on. He tells a horrific tale that sounds like it was lifted straight from the Donner party first they ate the oxen, then the horses, then their belts and shoes, and then&#133;. well&#133;one of the party died and&#133; Fearing for his life, Calhoun fled when there were only three of the party left, and made his way to Fort Spencer.The commander of the Fort, Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones) mounts a search party, Boyd among them, to try and rescue the remaining members of Calhoun's expedition. They eventually find the cave, and Boyd and Private Reich (Neal McDonough) go inside to investigate. Once inside, they find what is left of the pioneer band. And then the real horror begins.There is so much good stuff in this movie that I hardly know where to begin. The director, Antonia Bird, has a way of making the audience (well, me at least) feel the isolation of these men, and how out of touch they are with the rest of the world; of how truly alone they are. The characters are all well drawn, and one can find sympathy for even the worst of them. The performances are all good, although it seemed like David Arquette's character didn't have much to do; just giggle and act stoned most of the time (not much of a stretch). But all in all they seemed like real people to me; people who were in this fix, not just characters spouting lines in a play.The music was kind of hit and miss. Sometimes the twanging folksy sound seemed out of place with what was happening on the screen, but at other times it hit just the right note, sending shivers down my spine.This is not a movie for the squeamish. It is a story of cannibalism, of superstition and mystical power. It invokes the spirit of vampires drinking the blood of men and werewolves tearing at human flesh, and the ancient Indian legend of the wendigoRavenous is a reminder that not all monsters have fangs or masks or razor-tipped fingers. There are monsters who are handsome, cultured and well spoken, and that's what makes them all the more horrifying.

'Ravenous' is a wonderful adventure story about cannibalism in the old west. It's not meant to be taken seriously and the dark humor can either make this a very fun movie or excruciating one to watch. If you can deal with cannibalism with the old west then this is a must see!The acting is superb. Imagine a cast headed by Guy Pearce ('Memento') and Robert Carlyle ('The Full Monty', 'Trainspotting'.) Add in the talents of Jeffrey Jones ('Beetlejuice' and many cheesy 80's flicks) and this is a perfect cast for a little dark film such as this. Guy Pearce plays the main character, a war hero, who is summoned away from the Mexican-American war because he is actually a chicken. The action sets course when Robert Carlyle shows up at the Fort the Guy Pearce is now stationed at. Robert talks the commander (Jeffrey Jones) into going to the mountains to find his old party. Robert also mentions a bit of malicious cannibalism. Be set for a fun ride.While the story structure leaves some predictability, there are one or two surprises to keep the audience off full track. Even if it is predictable it's still a fun watch just because no one has dared to make something like this and managed to keep a decent realm of believability in it (there are a few 'whatever' scenes, but most action films go over the top with these.)Last but not least is the music for the movie. It is so out there, so off track, so out of the norm, that it is wonderful. If I dared played this music in my car with my friends they would probably beat some sense into me, but it fits so wonderfully with the movie and it's mood.

The film's evasion of sound marketing principles gives it a sixth sense, so that it trumps the industry that would attempt to corral it. Neither Blockbuster nor Jumbo are large enough for allegory; so one finds Ravenous at large among the shelves, as horror, comedy, drama, thriller.

Watching the movie, I still couldn't decide. I must say that this movie doesn't just allow you to comfortably categorize it checking one box or the other.

If you don't agree, see it again. When we left the theater, I was stunned. Boyd's first encounter with the mystery of cannibalism is when he's hiding under the bodies. The strength of it frightens him and he keeps his secret until he meets Ives. He's drawn into the story of the Windigo and tries to come to terms with what's happened to him. But he's also afraid. In the end (or close to it), he has to choose between dying and letting Ives win, or living and becoming what he is. The humor, suspense, and plot twists make this story watcher-friendly, only if you can handle it!I also liked the score. It snuck up on me sometimes.

Ravenous is  essentially a  vampire film, but a rather confused one.And that's a strong statement considering how varied vampire films can be. The vampire myth is whatever a film-maker wants to make of it really and then it becomes a matter of taste. And Ravenous is a vampire film where vampires aren't even mentioned!The idea is that according to American Indian lore, if you eat someone you gain their vitality. This sort of idea isn't confined to the American Indians either. The Aztecs were famous for sacrificing lesser mortals to their Gods which is handy if you want to keep the poor victim's social class under control and then there were those famous Cambodians who took to cannibalism during the American War a few years ago.These cannibalistic acts you could argue are a mile away from the ancient vampire myth. But you'd perhaps re-think that when you see Ravenous. After all The Vampire must continue to feed to live.The Vampire myths didn't originate thousands of years ago in mysterious Transylvania either. They were born only about a hundred years ago in the fecund mind of a London accountant called Bram Stoker. So film makers can make of vampirism of what they like, and they have.There have been countless variations on vampire lore. Silver bullets, wooden stakes, holy water, crucifixes, the sun, mirrors, cross bows, pikes and car winches have all been weapons which have either worked or not as the case may be against the Unholy ones. Pick which one you want. In Ravenous the weapon of choice seems to be the bear trap.Vampires are often very sexual (essentially the vampire myth has a very strong sexual element) and sometimes they are teenagers, elderly, male, female and even humourous.There is often a lot of blood too in vampire films and here we come to Ravenous. This tells the tale of an 18th century American soldier (Australia's Guy Pearce) who survives a massacre by playing dead beneath the corpses of his fellow soldiers. Blood gets into his mouth.He then is transferred to a remote snow bound weigh station where a man ( the excellent British actor Robert Carlyle) staggers in out of the weather telling a terrible story about how he was lost with a group of people in a cave in the snow and how they are forced to eat each other. A few of the soldiers return to the cave to look for survivors.Things get increasingly gory. Much blood is shed. People stew is made and you can't help think of the undead. This is all well and good except for the music which is inappropriate and also exceedingly loud. The music is penned by Michael Nyman and has such a feel of the Gothic that it often conflicts fundamentally with the mood of what is an outside adventure.Add to this the fact that the plot develops as slowly as stage blood congeals (which is not all it seems) and you have a trite, slight example of the fine and subtle art of vampirology.Two and a half Leg Stew Flies.

But she really isn't, and it really isn't.  The film was lots of gruesome violence from the very first scene, but what it lacks is an actual point. Now, about that first scene, which is backed up with the moderately entertaining setup that consists of a man named Capt. John Boyd being assigned to a remote army outpost in Nevada somewhere in the mid-1800's during the Mexican American war, has a near frozen man named Colqhuon stumble opon that very settlement and shatter the boredom of its small population. He tells a terrifying story in which his group of travelers got caught up in a hard storm, causing themselves to run out of food, leaving them no choice but to eat their animals, clothing&#133;and even each other. This man leads the soldiers to find the cave where the remaining survivors were left. This is where Bird jumps from dark comedy to out and out blood and guts, and the body count rises rapidly. It is amazing to see how extravagant the filmmakers are willing to go in showing the victims' deaths, and thematic elements hold nothing back. But even when the movie turns from suspense to mindless butchery the film still works on its own level. You see, the atmosphere is already developed, and the atmosphere is very intense. It has exceptional cinematography, and music made up of percussion pulses and awkward chimes; in my opinion this is a soundtrack worth purchasing. The music seems to set the mood for each seen, even when the characters seem stone faced, which most of the time is not present, for the actors inject sly, sneakiness into their characters making them just interesting enough to entertain, the rhythm holds attention as well. Although this movie really does lack some scary elements, music included, the film has enough material for a rude and aggressive shock factor for an audience to sink their teeth into.

It is a very visual film and the director should be commended. Very few cliches if any (none glaring), excellent costume design and character design. The preview has all the campy parts, and while I'd still categorize it as a dark comedy, it is a thriller about cannibalism, based on the Wendigo legends of the Pacific Northwest Native Americans, and it is gory. Not gratuitously, and the visual effects are colorful and unique. Gnawed skeletons coated in ice, for example. If the preview grabbed you at all, it is worth seeing; it's not quite what I expected plotwise, but the story moves well. The character vignettes are worthwhile. If you know nothing about the movie, it's about a Captain in the Army during the Mexican War sent to a godforsaken outpost in California, full of misfits, who rescue a traveller whose party ran out of food- and were forced to cannibalize.

One night a mysterious stranger (Robert Carlyle) shows up and tells a tale of how he needed to feed on human flesh to survive in a cave.  The thought of eating another person's flesh does not interest me in the slightest bit.  I even did not like seeing the various human flesh meals in the film Alive.  I however, enjoyed this film.  It was presented in a way not meant to be taken seriously.  The music in it was comic in a way to target this film as an almost black comedy.  The one thing that stood out in the film for me was the various twists.  There is more then meets the eye with the characters at various times.  The best advice would be to trust no one.  I thought the film was finely done.  I would have to disagree with the critics who thought otherwise.  Although this film is far from flawless, I would still have to say that there are certain scenes, shots and plots that appear brilliant at times. I would warn those with weak stomachs to avoid this film in the theaters and try to rent it at home. If you can see behind the gore, and see the film that it is, I would recommend it to you.  I give it about 3 stars.

When we first see him he is weak, nearly frozen and incoherent.  Through the film he grows in strength, confidence and attractiveness.The tone of the film shifts frequently between terror and laughter.  The cannibals are philosophical about their lot and given to one-liners. The original commanding officer regrets that cannibals find it hard to keep friends.  Ives comments that a recent meal was tough but that soldiers should be tough.  These tonal shifts make the film difficult to categorize but add enormously to the texture of the story.  People, especially those in difficult situations, shift moodsrapidly.  The edginess and tension of the situation is underlined by these mood shifts.Damon Albarn and Michael Nyman's music is appropriate if a bit too intrusive.  Anthony B.

He doesn't give us enough background about the characters, and there are a number of holes in the plot.

Manchevski gets no on-screen credit, leading one to wonder were the things he shot replaced or merely uncredited? Regardless, this film instantly stunned those who saw it in 1999 and it remains a strong film today (2014). Not flawless, not the greatest film of all time, but one that probably still has not achieved its full recognition (and sadly so, given that Bird passed in 2013). While the performance by David Arquette is lacking (not surprisingly), Pearce and Carlyle give it their all, and Neal McDonough shows some of his best work.The F.W. Colqhoun character in some ways anticipates The Stranger from 30 Days of Night (2007). This was likely not intentional, but their physical appearances and way of just appearing to let the audience know trouble is brewing is quite similar.The Shout! Factory release is certainly the definitive version thus far, with the added picture and sound of Blu-Ray. How much is new to this release is unclear -- there are over ten minutes of deleted scenes, an impressive three commentaries, and a few other goodies. The deleted scenes add a little to the background, and Bird's commentary on them make it clear why they were cut (primarily for pacing reasons). "},{"Title":"It's lonely being a cannibal. Tough to make friends.","Date":"26 July 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Certainly not your average tale of cannibalism, the ambitious project Ravenous is an enticing stew indeed. It craftily blends a couple of genres - (dark) comedy, horror, the period Western - with style and intelligence. While it's quite clear that it's not for all tastes, it's an enjoyable film through and through. The opening titles are the first indication that this will be somewhat offbeat, but what's pleasantly surprising are the ideas on the minds of the filmmakers, including screenwriter Ted Griffin and director Antonia Bird.Guy Pearce stars as John Boyd, a soldier fighting the Mexican-American war of 1847 who helps the Americans to win a crucial battle. However, his feat wouldn't have been possible had he not acted like a coward in the first place, so his superiors promote him to a job at a remote California outpost named Fort Spencer. Sometime after his arrival a stranger (Robert Carlyle) stumbles out of the dark winter night. Carlyle has a story of cannibalism to tell, but what he knows and his newfound acquaintances don't is that the story is ongoing.Lovers of the horror genre are more likely to appreciate this than most, as this gets quite deliciously gory (with great splatter created by the renowned KNB group) and there's plenty of atmosphere and an increasing amount of uneasiness as things progress. The music score by Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn is a little unusual but effective. Gorgeous photography of various breathtaking locations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia is another huge asset. The script ruminates on such topics on the whole aspect of meat eating and human morality. It contains some great speeches brought to life by an excellent cast.Pearce does a fine job of reacting throughout the movie, while Carlyle delivers a commanding and irresistibly amusing performance. Jeffrey Jones has one of his best film roles as the commander of the fort. David Arquette supplies some laughs as Private Cleaves. The rest of the cast consists of Jeremy Davies, John Spencer, Stephen Spinella, Neal McDonough, Joseph Runningfox, Bill Brochtrup, and Sheila Tousey. Watching as Pearce and Carlyle face off against each other as Pearce attempts to cling to some semblance of decency is a delight.All in all, this fun film is well worth a viewing for the curious and the strong of stomach.Eight out of 10.

No, audiences aren't often treated with a story that is literally that, a story, one you could imagine being told around a camp fire, and chilling you with its ability to make you believe it could happen to you. Too often we are treated to scenes of graphic violence in place of story lines, and we see all of the people on the screen as just that, figures to dispense with so the story can go on. This movie lives up to very few clichés, and makes the viewer so unnerved by what they think they are about to see, that when it actually happens and in a way contrary to what they thought, that surprise jumps them out of their seats, makes them give a squeal, and then wait for the next part of the ride. I have seen few movies that live up to my worst nightmares as a child, and this actually happens to be one of them. That the monster looks like a man, talks like one, and has no outward appearance of a monster, is what makes him a great success. Hold onto that feeling while watching this movie, that you are little and listening to a story. A story told around a fire and as the story continues to move, imagine as it does, that at any moment you might be dragged into it.

Ravenous, directed by Brit film-maker Antonia Bird that with it's darkly humorous but slightly unnerving tone. Only the contentious and delicate subject of paedophilia and child abuse really comes trumps when it comes to really bring out the most rawest and tenderest emotions in most people. And yet with Ravenous Bird still manages to exploit the morbid topic to create a chilling black/horror which manages to make your skin crawl.Garnering mixed reviews and performing less than favourably at the world box office, It's becoming something of a detriment to it as it proceeds to sink in to the mire of relative obscurity. Gaining some inspiration plot-wise to the historically infamous 19th Century Donner Party incident while adding a dark supernatural edge with it's use of Native American Folklore. The film is a sublime blend of Deliverance and The Thing utilising the vast, cold atmosphere of the Western Sierra Nevada's for it's backdrop. Set during the 1840's Mexican-American War, the film's main protagonist is Capt. William Boyd(Guy Pearce). Receiving a cynical promotion after an act of cowardice led to his whole platoon being massacred while he went on out of sheer luck to take the enemy's command single handedly. Boyd's superior out of disgust sends him to a military outpost in the Western Sierra Nevada's called Fort Spencer. A way-station run by a a motley, ramshackle Skeleton crew headed by the scholarly Col. Hart(Jeffrey Jones). No sooner has the Captain arrived when a half frozen Scotsman named Colquhoun(Robert Carlyle)wanders in to the Fort from the cold he imparts on them the sad and distressing tale of how he came to be in his predicament. He tells of how he was part of a small party of travellers making their ways across the desolate mountain range until a terrible snow storm forced them to take shelter in a cave. When the storm did not pass it resulted in the party's vile leader Ive's resorting to cannibalism. An act which led to the rest of the group being killed save one woman and Colquhoun who abandoned her to flee in to the wilderness. Duty bound to attempt to rescue the woman the crew prepare to make their way to the cave with Scotsman acting as guide. But before they depart one of the teams two Native American members George warns them of the Wendigo. A demon of ancient legend which possesses the body of any mortal man who feeds of human flesh and leaves them with an insatiable taste for it!Comprising of a cast of mainly competent and skilled actors (with the exception of David Arquette) and with It's desolate, claustrophobic setting and deft utilisation of mythological folklore interwoven in to the tapestry of the story. Ravenous is an inspired twist on the small band of people in a confined area being picked off by a inhuman monstrosity sub-genre. And yet not only is the enemy is the evil that lurks within the deceptive veneer of a seemingly innocent man. It is also the sceptical, oblivious nature of the band of misfits that leads them to the ultimate misdirection of who the real threat is! As Boyd, Guy Pearce gives a wonderfully bemused performance as the flawed but ultimately heroic solider who gives the film it's moral compass. Provided with a brilliant co-star in Robert Caryle who makes for a delightfully malignant and manipulative foil in Colquhoun/ Ives, the two have memorably tense moments where a game of wills is played out with Boyd's soul being the prize which is at stake. And with the double edged dual performance of Colquhoun/Ives Caryle manages to bridge the transition from his false personae to the the antagonists true self superbly. The rest of the cast don't disappoint either with veteran actor Jeffrey Jones bringing an amiable, easy going yet understated, frustrated melancholy in Col. Hart with Stephen Spinella, Neal McDonough, Jeremy Davies et al. offering solid support. With a sinisterly quirky score provided by Michael Nyman and former Blur front-man Damon Albarn complimenting the films jet black sensibilities as as it's slight satirical edge. Director Bird never let's it's idiosyncratic comedy get too out of control. And although the film does lapse in to the rare moment of the overtly surreal it does boast a memorably haunting nightmare sequence which while bizarre punctuates Boyd's inner struggle with the demon that his growing inside of himself. Of course, Ravenous won't be(and wasn't)for everyone. With it's bold, horrific premise and it's more bloody, graphic imagery deterring those of a more squeamish nature or be it's unconventional, left field approach to the Horror genre. It's a film that has no doubt divided those who have viewed it. Visually bleak as it should be and with a oddly lumbering but satisfactory finale leading to one of the most brilliantly deadpan deliveries of a line put to screen shortly before the curtain draws a close. Ravenous is not so much an under-appreciated classic but an overlooked and under appreciated film never the less which deserves more attention than it received.

For that it did itself no favours with the public, but it gained a certain amount of respect and admiration from a good many.Captain Boyd (Guy Pearce) is sent to a Californian Fort in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, as punishment for his cowardice. He is celebrated as a hero publicly after overtaking an enemy stronghold, but as he points out he was only able to do so by an act of cowardice. He played dead, and was stacked in with other dead men piled on top of him, their blood running into his mouth. This he says changed him, gave him strength, and he was subsequently able to fight his way out from behind enemy lines. Since it would set a bad precedent to explicitly punish him, the army sends him to the isolated post.Fort Spencer is cold, lonely, and quite unsettling. There is but a skeleton crew - Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones), Pvt Toffler, the religious one (Jeremy Davies), Pvt Cleaves (David Arquette), Knox (Stephen Spinella), and Reich, the soldier (Neal McDonough). Also at the post are two Native Americans, George and Martha, who it is said more or less came with the location.One night a mysterious man shows up, claiming to have been lost on an expedition for three months now in the mountains. They survived by eating whatever they could until the first casualty, then they ate the body. Their taste for human meat was peaked, and they began killing each other off to quench their evergrowing hunger. That man is Calhoun (Robert Carlyle). He claims that he ran away from the group, and that there is only one woman left, and a man who's hunger could not be sufficed, Col Ives. He leads the soldiers to a cave where it turns out he is actually the real Col Ives, and has tricked them into a trap.The film turns from there into a cat and mouse game between Boyd and Ives, and a tale of to eat or not to eat human flesh, which the Native George explains allows the eater to gain the power of the eaten. Director Antonia Boyd, a vegetarian, makes scenes of eating rather repulsive, and uses music as a focal point for highlighting the strangeness of the picture. She makes Ravenous not a horror-gore fest (though there are moments horror in nature and occasional buckets of gore), but a pitch black comedy-thriller-suspense-mystery.The film is ambitious, maybe a little too ambitious for its script. It gets lost at times shifting between its genres and intentions, which likely was the directors intention though. This film is not just offbeat, its a mish mash of entirely different tempos. That could have been a recipe for disaster, but Bird handles things at just the right pace, and just the right oddity to create what really is a very unique and entertaining film. I like to think of Ravenous as something of a cult favorite of mine. I admire greatly the work here. Bird makes the locations feel cold, dirty, and uncomfortable, and the actors all hit their marks with the right resonance. Carlyle is particularly menacing, and darkly amusing, as Ives/Calhoun. The actors should all be commended, not least for their courage to take on such a strange project that was clearly doomed to fail at the box office.The music is more or less a star in the film itself. Its strange, amusing, bewildering, and fascinating all at once.Yes, the story loses its way at times, and seems to be there simply to suffice the films style and texture, but Ravenous is a film that cries out for such style. I don't know if its necessarily aiming for greatness, but its reaching high into uncharted skies, and for that I am one of those who's admiration and respect Ravenous has earned.

Boyd is an interesting character, a coward disgusted by himself and by life in general; Pearce is convincing in this unusual part. The plum role belongs to Carlyle, who is up to the task. As Colqhoun he is meek, awkward, broken, his narration of the disastrous expedition chilling. As Ives, he is evil incarnated. Notice how physically threatening he manages to appear, although he is not really a big guy. Supporting actors are well cast and uniformly solid.Direction by Antonia Bird, photography and production design allow viewers to feel the cold and isolation of Fort Spencer. And I liked the unexpected bouts of black humour, like the banjo ballad during the chase scene. By all logic it's silly and should be awful, but it works.Writer Ted Griffin provides some vivid lines of dialogue and manages to insert some social commentary, making an implicit comparison between the Wendigo and our greed-driven society, in which people are ready to destroy others - metaphorically cannibalizing them - to succeed. It's not heavy-handed, but it's there.The first half is fantastic. Unfortunately, after the midpoint shift at the cave, Ravenous degenerates to an extent.

I can guarantee, though, that some one who finds cannibalism actually revolting and not worth mentioning would HATE this movie.Ravenous presents a tale revolving around an Indian myth in which eating the blood of another man can bring forth supernatural strength. Cannibalism is likened to a drug; despite it's potential healing powers, it is actually addictive!It's not just about cannibalism, but cannibalism is most of the fun. Ravenous has a cast of lower-A and upper-B-list actors, including Guy Pearce, Jeffrey Jones, Robert Carlyle, and David Arquette- and all are at the top of their games (however high that may be). It's a finely scripted and finely directed piece of work. The music especially stands out, composed by film veteran Michael Nyman and rock/pop veteran Damon Albarn; the score is unconventional and original, and perfect for this film. For some people, it may be the most memorable thing about it.To some people, it might just seem silly and sloppy. The film is split into two parts, which is uncommon and can bother a viewer without them really knowing what's bothering them. Ravenous certainly does have an unusual plot, and the fact that it features people eating one another because of an Indian myth probably doesn't help its stature. But to me, it's a splendid film.

This film would have been standard and boring had it been a linear tale of good versus evil. Instead we get confused and confusing characters you can never fully relate to, but enjoy watching.Bottom line, if you're looking for something unconventional and want to grin from ear to ear, check it out. It's brutal, comical and above all entertaining. Does it deserve the 10 out of ten rating I'm giving it? Probably not, but time after time I watch this movie and have a lot of fun and appreciate its unique nature.

When the opportunity presented itself, I snatched it up knowing that my expectations were much too high to actually enjoy any film, no matter how good. But Ravenous delivers, and in a big way. There are no weak spots in this almost all-star cast, the writing is is sensible and the dialog smart. Is it a horror movie? In some ways. Is it gory? Oh yes. In fact, regardless of how much gore was used, you get the feeling that this may be one of the most gore-filled flicks since Braindead. Part of this is because the film actually translates and emphasizes every drop of blood so that it gets maximum effect, but not to the extent that it seems forced. There is also a great story with strong messages, but it almost takes a backseat to the acting and fx. It does what movies should do, be enjoyable and make you think about them after the fact. Is cannibalism wrong? What would you do if you had to choose life or death? Definitely a movie worth buying, but send the kids to bed before popping it in. Don't be surprised to find yourself talking about the hypothetical situations this work demands you think about.It's normal.

I must or would like to relate a story about my first viewing. In 2000, I lay at home awaiting a back surgery, severe sciatic nerve compression. My surgeon had placed me on very high doses of Morphine. Well, I laid in my bed with the TV glowing, drifting in and out of consciousness for several weeks. I had at sometime (although I do not remember doing so) watched at least half of this film. I know this because a potion of the film ( I found Later) was recorded on my VCR which stopped recording during a power outage. The day came for my surgery and off I went to hospital. Several hours later I lay in my hospital bed wrapped in warming blankets, again lost in a haze of opiates.I would drift away and hear, just barely, a soft vaguely familiar piece of music playing. Then came the dream. I found myself in a winter-scape constantly pursued by characters from the film. I have to say it was very unsettling and when I related this to my surgeon he assigned it to the high level of narcotics. But still he looked at me strangely. Two days passed and back in the operating room I went and out again. Still the dream haunted me. Well after I improved I was sent home to recover. On my initial follow-up visit with my Dr, he started the conversation off with,  have you ever seen a film entitled Ravenous? I thought and replied in the negative. It was a full 3 weeks before I ventured back up the steps to my bedroom, having no desire to climb steps. There in my VCR I found the unfinished recording. Suffice it to say I was much relieved. The dream had faded but, the whole episode was very real and unnerving.

A strange little film that seems to slip under a lot of peoples radar, and it's a shame...it really is an original, extremely enjoyable film.Lt. Boyd is a war hero, depending on how you look at it. He successfully killed a whole battalion of opposing troops, but was only able to do so by playing possum while his comrades were cut down around him. His superiors realize that while his act of cowardice bordered on treason, he also did single-handedly take an enemy compound. As a punishment/reward, Lt. Boyd is sent to a remote outpost in the hills of California, basically to get him out of sight. Once at the outpost, Boyd meets up w/several other colorful characters, including drunken, dope smoking David Arquette, and his boss Col. Hart (Jeffrey Jones, the Principal from FERRIS BUELLER). One night a stranger stumbles into their camp - starving, freezing, and spinning a strange tale of adventure, cannibalism, and mayhem...Boyd, Hart, and crew (with the mysterious stranger in-tow...) decide to investigate the claims - and it all goes downhill from there...RAVENOUS perfectly combines elements of adventure, horror, occult lore, and pitch-black comedy into an extremely entertaining mixture of a film without ever becoming too self-indulgent. I think this movie was in the theaters (at least here in the States...) for all of about 15 minutes, so many people missed this one. If I remember the commercials correctly, they tried to pitch this as a straight-comedy, but no one seemed to get the punch-line. The best part about RAVENOUS is you can now typically find this wonderful film in the $5 section of most of the larger Audio/Visual store chains. That is in fact how I came about this great film a few years ago, as a blind-buy, only remembering the 1 or 2 commercials and reading the back cover. One of the best $5 I've ever spent.

The movie was a complete 10 and well worth every award it has won, if not worthy of more. My comment however, is on the perfectly awesome score! The Irish-inspired theme played in the beginning and twice throughout the film sets such a perfect feeling for the scenes in which it appears. Played over scenes that otherwise might be dark or suspenseful, the light, airy melody, (which is somewhat reminiscent of elevator music) adds an inherent sense of ironic humor, whenever it appears. It also seems to connect the scenes where it is played by a similar feeling that has you thinking back on the irony of last scene it was present in.The Hillbilly song played in the scene where Ives chases Toffler gives a humorous feel to a scene that in most horror movies would have been played up to be very suspenseful and serious. The composition gives the scene a very unique attitude, rather perfectly capturing Ives' madness and the joy of the hunt he is expressing. It lets you step toward his perspective and find the whole thing hilarious, instead of siding you with Toffler and trying to make you afraid and anxious as most horror movies try to do.This movie captured your sympathy for the characters, stepping aside of the typical horror movie attempts to capture your empathy (making you feel what the victimized characters feel.) In Ravenous, you find yourself feeling sorry /that/ the characters who are killed have died because they were such an asset to the film that you wish they could have stuck around for the rest of it! All in all, Ravenous jumped all the hurdles on the very difficult obstacle coarse to being a great movie, but frankly I feel that success was greatly aided by the perfect musical accompaniment. After all, without the humorous bent that the music added, scenes where this movie stepped so far out of the box would have been much more difficult, if not impossible to achieve. Complete 10.

It's creepy and sinister without being gory. Instead, it creates a very atmospheric setting, slowly builds tension to a breaking point, and explores dark and unpleasant aspects of the human psyche, probing issues of cowardice, fear, and evil within people in a way reminiscent of a Conrad story like Lord Jim or the Heart of Darkness. It takes those issues a little further into the realm of horror without cheap thrills, blood and guts or the like.At the same time, the film is filled with little bits of humour and general levity, as well as irony. It is symptomatic of this film's non-gory and quirky approach to the issue that the most visually disturbing and unsettling scene is a point when officers sit down to eat a meal of very bloody steak.The actors all perform wonderfully as well. Guy Pearce is great as the Conrad-themed coward who has to grapple his myriad of fears to resolve the issues of the film while Robert Carlyle is brilliant as the apparently crazy villain with a dark sense of humour. The others add great support, with Jeffrey Jones in particular giving a turn as a rather strange character who seems unsettlingly in good spirits and quite matter of fact about the disturbing events of which he becomes a part.The resulting mix of tension, intelligent horror, humour, and the atmospheric setting and feel of the film creates a wonderfully different film that is creepy, unsettling, and fun all at the same time.

H was right. 'Ravenous' is witty, very well acted, well paced, nicely photographed and has great music. It's also a little absurd. I mean, didn't that South American rugby team ('Alive') prove once and for all there is nothing supernatural about cannibalism? What about Jeffrey Dahmer?Guy Pearce plays a American officer during the Mexican/American war. His cowardice is rewarded by fate and he becomes a war hero. However, the general, realizing Pearce is a coward, exiles him to a fort in the California mountains. Pearce's colonel, Jeffrey Jones, wittily describes the platoon of derelicts who man the fort. These include a religious fanatic, a military macho man, a goofy soldier played by David Arquette, a drunken doctor, an Indian scout and his sister. One night, Calqhoun (Robert Carlyle) arrives at the fort and collapses. When he recovers, Calqhoun tells a bizarre story of cannibalism amongst a 'Donner Party' type wagon train heading west. One of the settlers had died of malnutrition and exposure and the others had eaten his remains. Calqhoun admits he ate some of the meat, but then goes on to describe mass murder initiated by a member of the party, Colonel Ives. Jeffrey Jones, Guy Pierce and several other soldiers follow Calqhoun to the site of the murders. To explain more would spoil the story. However, There are a couple of illogic points in the film, I'd like to discuss.WARNING SPOILERSWhy didn't the doctor, David Arquette and the Indian woman recognize Colonel Ives as Colqhoun when he returned to the camp? Why did the Indian woman threaten to kill Pearce when he had a chance to kill Ives/ Colqhoun? Were her beliefs stronger than her desire for revenge of the murder of her brother? Why did Ives/ Colqhoun at one point suggest the General was also a cannibal, then plot to eat him when he returned to the fort?END OF SPOILERSSpecial note must be made of Jeffrey Jones' and Robert Carlyle's funny/clever performances. They are both consistently entertaining. Jones has the movie's best line, comparing cannibalism to communion. The usually outstanding Pearce is no more than competent. Arquette is totally wasted.'Ravenous' is a repulsive concept, though well executed. However, I did think the ending could have been handled much better.

Their appetite for wealth is immense and insatiable. In fact, unlike the hunger for food, the very taste of wealth stimulates more greed and more consumption, not less. And the same is true for the taste of human flesh. Wealth makes you stronger. It helps you live longer. It makes you healthy. But it's also addictive. People eat until they get full, and then they stop. But wealth and human flesh are different. For these, if you consume a little, you only want more. The only people in the movie who realize this are the Native Americans; and they clearly want no part of Western capitalism, and are fully aware of its dangers. Cannibalism is symbolic of capitalism.

It's nearly what I would call a perfect film. It's got great acting, a fantastic score, an unique and cleverly played-off plot, and enough dark humor to keep one with a smile throughout most of the film. It starts with a soldier named Boy (played by Guy Pearce) in the Mexican-American War. In the heat of battle he chickens out and plays dead. While in among the bodies of dead friends and allies, he finds some strength to retaliate and helps win the battle. For this, he receives a medal and promotion. However, not everyone buys this, and so Boyd is placed out in the middle of nowhere with a rather kooky bunch of people including Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones) the head of the place, Toffler (Jeremy Davies) the priest and local religious guy, Knox (Stephen Spinella) the drunk, Reich (Neal McDonough) the tough guy, Cleaves (David Arquette) the druggie and friend of the two Native Americans at the fort. While Boyd is there, adjusting to the strange group of people and his own demons of his cowardice, a mysterious stranger appears. Thristy, hunger, and frostbitten, the Fort takes him in. His name is Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) and he has quite a tale to tell. It involves his party, heading west, getting caught in a storm and hiding out in a cave. Later they are stranded in the cave with little food. This leads to a dilemma of what to eat... Until one of the party members dies... Yes, the tale leads to a Donner Party experience, where the group resorts to cannibalism. Colqhoun just barely made it out with his life to find help for the one other person being held captive by one of the party who loves the taste of human meat. And so Boyd, Hart, Toffler, and Knox travel with Colqhoun to find and rescue the last the person alive. However, while traveling they discover that Colqhoun may not be all that he seems and Boyd realizes he may have gotten a taste for more then cowardice out in the war... I won't spoiler the twists in the movie because they simply too good to ruin. The movie itself has horror overtones with its dealing of cannibalism and in some ways, even vampirism. The script have some smart dialogue and the film treats audiences like they have a mind (always a good thing). The acting of Pearce as the silently tormented Boyd is good and compelling however both Jeffrey Jones and more importantly Robert Carlyle steal the show. Carlyle gives one of those performances in which it's hard to repeat and it's hard to forget. Jones is in the movie for a short period but leaves his mark as a rather bored, cynic colonel of the fort and seemingly the only friend of Boyd. The other actors do good jobs with what they have, but most of them are barely in the film long enough for one to truly get to know and appreciate them, unfortunately. The atmosphere in the film is rich and dark, which is a bit off-set with the all so white snow all around and the brightly haunting score. I could go on about the score for a while but I'm just going to say it's great and leave it at that. The director Antonia Bird knows what she's doing and filmed the one and only scene to ever make me even consider vegetarianism (PETA could learn from her).

Later, I happened to catch the last twenty minutes or so on the Sci-Fi Channel, and could see that it had style, and that it just might be a worthwhile film after all.  Since it was not rerun since then, I finally rented a video of RAVENOUS, despite my weak stomach and the realization that the worst instances would not be edited.There was little to worry about on that count, as there is nothing in the film that should bother anybody, except the most sensitive viewer, beyond an initial few seconds.  Antonia Bird, the perceptive and talented director at the helm, has shown a remarkable and most welcome degree of restraint. Directors who use excessive gore usually do so in order to cover up the fact that they have no story.  Here, there is a very compelling story to tell, and there is no need for unnecessary excess.  For those of you looking for much more blood and gore, and disappointed by the relative lack therein, that's not an issue for me to comment on.  We'll leave that matter between you and your psychiatrist.The story that remains is still a sufficiently grim and grisly tale, with dashes of well-placed dark humor, punctuated by a truly offbeat music soundtrack.  It is c.1849, and a phony war hero named Boyd is posted far away to isolated Fort Spencer.  Besides the permissive and unassuming commander, Col. Hart, there is a small detachment of assorted personalities Reich, an enthusiastic gung ho type;  Toffler, an annoyingly weak-willed holy joe; Knox, a drunken doctor;  Cleaves, a blurry cook; and two Native Americans named George and Martha.  A stranger soon intrudes upon this setting, with his terrible account of cannibalism and people being held prisoner in a remote cave.A rescue group is then formed, consisting of Hart, Boyd, Reich,  Toffler, George, and the stranger, and sets out to find the cave.  Once there, events both inside and outside the cave reach a tense, pulse-pounding conclusion, as the true identity of the cannibal becomes known.  The scene is driven by a totally unsettling score playing in the background.  Then, surprisingly, the tension is eased or at least redirected, with a catchy banjo tune playing as the cannibalistic killer pursues hapless Toffler through the woods.  As Reich and Boyd give chase, some yodeling can be heard to accompany the banjos.  Who would think of that?  A twisted sense of humor is at play here, and it all works.Guy Pearce has the protagonist role of Boyd, a war hero who was not really a hero and is anything but heroic.  This actor is not meant to play run-of-the-mill good guys, but is at his best when playing troubled characters, tormented by their inner demons.  Such is the case here, when it is slowly revealed that some of Boyd's later actions are guided not so much by any cowardice but by something far different.  No one could have given this part the same emotional depth.Robert Carlyle, who can project sinister without hardly trying, creates an inspired incarnation of evil.  His dominating performance is actually four different characterizations.  First he's Calhoun, the supposed survivor of the ill-fated party that became stranded and resorted to cannibalism. Then he apparently deteriorates into a babbling idiot, unhinged as the rescue group approaches the cave where the atrocity took place.  Then he reveals himself to be the cannibal, a crafty, playfully murderous individual, who toys with his victims and exhibits a wild energy.  And finally, he turns up yet again, this time in the guise of the outwardly cultured Col. Ives.Jeffrey Jones gives another memorable performance, convincing and sympathetic as the well-meaning fort commander.  Of the other actors, only the intense Neal McDonough makes any impression, all too briefly effective as the recklessly fearless Reich.  Maybe parts of his role were trimmed, but David Arquette's Cleaves makes little sense career-wise unless he thought his performance as an 1849 doper would be hilarious.  It isn't.  He doesn't have much to do and is unable to do anything with it.  Jeremy Davies is equally forgettable as Toffler.  Joseph Running Fox and Sheila Tousey, as Native Americans employed at the fort, aren't given much to do either, but their undeniable presence adds a note of authenticity.However, after Boyd makes his big leap, the story literally has nowhere to go but down.  This is only a slight turn because the story is still compelling, just not quite as compelling as the first half of the film. The second half is unable to maintain the same tension, humor, and surprise, but that might have been an  impossible task.  In the latter part of the story, momentum is somewhat lost, and everything is almost (I said almost) bogged down by a lot of mumbo jumbo on the benefits of cannibalism (apparently curative, in addition to its revitalizing and addictive powers).But the climax is impressively destructive, a brutal and bloody confrontation between good and evil, here represented by the flawed Boyd and the ghoulish Ives.  Right up to the very end, it remains an open question as to which is the stronger man's sense of morality or his will to survive.

"},{"Title":"A Brilliant Black Comedy.","Date":"17 March 2003","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  During the opening sequence of RAVENOUS, we see Capt. John Boyd (Guy Pearce) on the battlefield.  Afterwards, he is declared a hero and is treated to a steak dinner to celebrate.  The following scene is a carnivorous orgy blood, masticating, consumption, teeth tearing at meat.  Boyd, overwhelmed by this display, jolts into another room and vomits.  Just as he does so, the title for this film appears on the screen; this pretty much sets the darkly comedic tone for the rest of RAVENOUS.Boyd's superiors have other plans for this hero however.  He is sent to Ft. Spencer, in the remote region of Sierra Nevada.  His commanding officer there is Col. Hart (a jolly Jeffrey Jones), who instigates a montage, introducing the characters, etc.  It would seem that Boyd's fort-mates each have some kind of dark secret (or that some of them are mentally deficient and cannot serve elsewhere).  Everything is well in place for the real story to begin a drifter named Calhoun (Robert Carlyle) wanders into this remote location.  Half-dead, he tells a tale not unlike the real happenings of the Donner Party and the Jayhawkers (which occurred about the same time as the film is set).  A tale of murder and cannibalism that provokes the occupants of Ft. Spencer on a journey to find the truth...I'm not going to write much more about the plot here.  The story, by Ted Griffen who uses the Windigo myth as a starting point, is only one element of this fine film.  Antonia Bird, the director of RAVENOUS, and her cinematographer, Anthony B. Richmond, have created a visually stunning piece of work.  Bird (who arrived on the project at the last minute) deftly executes a very nuanced story and never allows the events to become overly silly.  Much credit must go to Bryce Perrin, who designed and coordinated the look of the sets.  Ft. Spencer comes to life with a distinct presence and style, traditional, yet slightly gothic.  The setting and tone are helped greatly by the score, by Damon Albarn & Michael Nyman, which is just strange enough to work in this film; from piano loops to twangy getaway music, the score matches the macabre visuals perfectly.  The cast is great, especially Carlyle, who seems to relish his scenes of over-the-top mayhem.Memorable moments abound in RAVENOUS.  One of my favorite scenes is when Boyd and Calhoun stand in the falling snow and speak of cannibalism as a kind of literal incarnation of Manifest Destiny of man consuming the earth from whenst he came, devouring it.  Boyd's cannibal fantasy stands out, as does the well-staged and brutal climax.  The final shot is as funny as it is haunting.  That is the important thing to remember here this is a black comedy. The film-makers have their tongues firmly planted in cheek as they run wild with this material.  It is gory, campy, disturbing, funny, all in turn.  Just consider the scene at the campsite when one of the characters exclaim He was licking me!; or the line He was tough, but then a good soldier should be.  The trailers made RAVENOUS look like a horror film, which it is to a certain degree, but it also plays as a wicked piece of satire.  The humor is twisted, and is not for everyone, to be sure.  But, whether the reaction is laughter or revulsion, the film has worked on some level.  RAVENOUS is a unique and smart film, well executed by the cast and crew, and is destined to become one of the true cult classics of the 90's.  10/10  "},{"Title":"Windigos and Hollywood","Date":"24 August 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  This is a great film with a fine cast and some fine storyline.  The theme is cannibalism and it is spoofed to the max.  There are several fine reviews herein that outline the plot and I don't need to add to those.  However, as an anthropologist I would like to point out one issue or misconception that crops up in the film and reviews, albeit it deals only tangentally with this very fine flick.The windigo is an Ojibwa term for a monster who is never seen.  In fact, to gaze on one, is instant death for the beholder.  It is only known by its tracks, a human footprint with a drop of blood in the middle.  The origins of the windigo myth are several but at the root of it is the pan-human taboo of eating human flesh.  Cannibalism, or anthropophagy, is seen in three forms  incorporative, ritual and survival.  Incorporative, which is extremely rare among human groups, is where other humans are hunted and eaten as food;  ritual, is very common and usually entails eating bits of human flesh to garner some of the spirit of the slain victim; survival, is where dead individuals are eaten by survivors who have no other food source, e.g., the famous Donner party of California, the Uruguayan rugby team in the Andes, etc.  Where humans eat other humans other than for survival nearly always has a ritual basis and there are many recorded accounts of cannibalism among the Aztecs of Mexico, several hill tribes of New Guinea and elsewhere.  At the other end of the scale, survival cannibalism was widely reported among many Native American tribes in areas where extreme winters occurred.  It is in this context the windigo myth occurs.  Indeed, one finds many similar invisible cannibal monsters among the Mic-Mac of Maine, the Blood of Canada, the 5 Iroquois nations and many other Algonquian tribes of Northeastern America.  There are also similar mythic monsters in Native American lore in Calfornia, although Californian Native Americans referring to this monster as a Windigo is straight out of some Hollywood writer's imagination. The theme of this film embraces the spirit of ritual cannibalism (no pun intended) and that's what makes it work so well.  As a film, I have to agree as to its potential cult status and I certainly thoroughly enjoyed it and the soundtrack.

Bird has also directed another great film of the 90's, Priest, but this is very different movie. Ravenous stars Guy Pierce, Robert Carlyle and David Arquette. Pierce plays captain Boyd, who is sent to distant military outpost somewhere in Sierra Nevada's wilderness. The weather is pretty cold all the time and snow is everywhere..*The following paragraph includes minor spoilers*Boyd arrives there and introduces himself to the people at the outpost. There are not many people, just 6 or 8 and they have nothing special to do, only guard and wait, because there is some kind of war going on. Soon, almost frozen man (Robert Carlyle in manic performance) arrives there and once Boyd and others have warmed him and let him rest, he tells the horrific story of his and how he ended like this, almost frozen to death. It turns out that the mysterious visitor's patrol was trapped because of storm, and then after weeks they had to start to think about cannibalism in order to stay alive. That's not the half of it, and once Boyd, the visitor and few others go to the cave they were trapped, the real nightmare and terror is revealed...*No more spoilers!*This film is marvellous in many ways. This must be seen 30 times and still it unfolds more. The film is satire, comedy and horror adventure at the same time and it succeeds in every department. Philosophically, the film is about man's brutality and savagery and instincts that should be kept un-active. This is perfectly symbolized as Carlyle's character tells about the pleasure of eating human flesh and how it makes the eater almost dependent on it and feel very powerful and virile. This may sound little pessimistic, but all this film says is true and these things are hiding under every human being psyche and soul. This all is clear as we see other characters turning into Carlyle during the film. By chasing a beast one must be careful not turning into one himself, and that Nietzsche citation is definitely not without a purpose on the screen before the credits..Pretty striking start for a movie!Ravenous can also be seen as a statement about military and all the wars and horror we have created for ourselves. It is WE who cannot live in peace and without killing, and films like Ravenous (and many others) only show this with the tools of art, and it is definitely not pleasant thing to see, or accept and thus these films are way too difficult for most viewers to understand. Films like Ravenous are important, but still very hard to understand and accept, due to their difficult imagery and symbolism.Technically the film is absolutely stunning. The cinematography is fantastic and the scenery almost nailed me into the chair. This should definitely be seen in Big screen or at least in widescreen format on DVD or VHS. The film will still lose its power if it's watched elsewhere than in movie theatre. One thing I found irritating about Ravenous is the editing, which is way too often too fast and restless. The fast editing works fine in the opening scene at the dinner as the military officers eat fast, greedy and without any gratitude. In that scene the fast edits were effective elements, but on other scenes they are unnecessarily fast and should have been finished with more care, I think.The music is composed by Damon Albarn (singer of Blur) and Michael Nyman (The Piano, Gattaca) and the music is fantastic with all its details and different instruments. It is like nothing I've heard in movies for some time. The soundtrack is so great it would work fine without the film, too, and I think I'll probably get the CD if I found it somewhere. The music is very important element in cinema, and Ravenous is once again a new example of powers of music as a tool of creating atmosphere in all its forms.Ravenous is pretty violent and bloody film and cannot be recommended for those who cannot stand gory and violent imagery. The violence is prehaps little too plenty and couple of scenes don't do any good to the film itself, and seem to be there without any purpose. However, the film is full of ideas and symbols, and the film is not realistic, so the violence can and must be seen symbolically, too. After all, Ravenous is not any gore fest, but still it is very gory and may disturb some viewers. And if someone becomes irritated about the film's violence, then it is easy to judge the whole film and hate it; that is usually the case with difficult cinema.Robert Carlyle gives one of his most lunatic performances here as an incarnation of pure evil. He is so crazy at times that he'll almost come through the television to your living room. He was pretty over-the-top in Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, but here he is far more dangerous and evil. Other actors do fine job, too, but Carlyle is the most memorable. Occasionally characters acts are not explained satisfyingly and there is one moment of violence that Guy Pierce commits, I found very irritating, since I didn't find any motif and reason why he did it. It seemed like they had to get rid of that one character somehow and ended up like this, killing him without any explanation. These kind of holes in films are little annoying, but since this films has so many merits and noteworthy achievements, they can be forgiven, but not forgotten.Ravenous is among the most interesting films of the 90's and I'm extremely pleased how great this film looks and how many things it has to give for me. I wish I'd seen this on big screen. The music, cinematography, many surprises in the screenplay and Bird's stylish direction have created one memorable and surrealistic piece of art that is not likely to disappoint the lovers of intelligent cinema. 9/10  "},{"Title":"I laughed my ass off","Date":"14 June 2002","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Being a fan of dark comedies, I decided to give this movie a chance disregarding the awful reviews.

The films topic is harsh, but shot against the timeframe of the Mexican-American war in the 1840's.  There are many contrasts in the film, one being the character(s) played by Carlyle.  A fearful man in one half of the film, and a man to be feared in the other half.  But the real question becomes is he really a man?  The movie of survival of the fittest, ironically takes play during a wartime setting, so in the film, the battle lines are drawn in a different sense.  The disturbing tale takes place in the mountains during the winter, which leads to some beautiful cinematography, countered by some very realistic, yet bloody and gross, scenes between the characters later in the film.

The fact that this one takes place during the Mex-Am War makes it all the better.Guy Pierce plays an Army captain who gets stationed at a remote fort in the Sierras after a rather outstanding act of cowardice and bravery.  One night, a stranger, half dead, stumbles into camp and tells a story of how he and his wagon party were turned into cannibals by a rogue Army colonel.  You see, cannibalism has the power to heal all wounds, and turns the eater into some kind of *ubermensch*.  So, you can see where the appeal might be. The soldiers decided to go find the cannibal colonel, and see if any of the party is still alive, which violates the cardinal rule of cannibal movies don't go in the woods.  Needless to say, it's slobberin' time.The gore factor is way up in this one (which is surprising for a movie in this day and age).  Carlyle is good as the surviving party member, and Jones, looking like Ben Franklin, is pretty funny as the forts commanding officer.  The movie's only real problems are that it went on for too long, and the music is slightly annoying (but pretty original).

Appetite-wise, Ravenous does sound meatier (pun intended) than voracious (more Tony Richardson 's Tom Jones 1963 style, with Albert Finney and co.)This is no ordinary tale. It happens around 1847 during the Mexican-American War. There may be uniformed soldiers you see on screen, but it's not an U.S. Army Western. It's more personal and darker as the story moves along. Guy Pearce is Captain Boyd, the central focus of the film. And so it seems. By and by, when Robert Carlyle's character appears, one kinda sense the focus shifts to him vs. Pearce. Then again, we're back into the soul of Captain Boyd and his internal struggling with the whole dilemma of the man-eating idea did he, or didn't he -- he himself, and he the Carlyle's Colquhoun character -- relish in eating the flesh of another (dead) man, on the grounds of keeping himself alive and healthy?This is really not a novel idea I remember how traditional sayings did suggest You are what you eat. Say you need more brain power, eat the head of some animal, e.g., they say people who eat fish head are known to be cleverer; liver for liver, heart for your heart, tendons for joint injury recovery, etc. I do believe it's all in one's mind. As Andrew Bergman's The Freshman 1990, with Marlon Brando and Matthew Broderick, might suggest most of the time people do not know what's being served -- iguana meat or chicken meat; here, in Ravenous, a general who spoon-tasted a pot of soup commented, Mm, tasty, without realizing the tasty result was from the stewing of a man's meat.Think however you like if you're a movie fan who's hungry and daring on whatever's served, see it. If the whole idea of eating another man's meat is not quite flavorful to you, don't see it. In any case, there is drama, action and suspense in Ravenous. (I wonder if Ives has eaten a bird or two enabling him to move light as a bird and jumps up in flight?)  This very well might become a cult classic. Seriously, no ordinary tale this is.The movie is not vampiric. If you prefer vampire action drama plus martial arts, see Stephen Norrington's Blade 1998, with Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff -- intensely well-made film and impressive set especially towards the end. Caution don't let the sprinkler shower of blood scene in the beginning deter you -- it has it's own meaning (funny it's also based on the power of blood being life-giving and continuing!) and you will appreciate the intensity after all.A lighter vampiric side, try John Landis' Innocent Blood 1992, with La Femme Nikita Anne Parillaud, Anthony LaPaglia and Robert Loggia; it's a fun, romantic comedy take on a lovely French vampyre, a cop and a crime boss. For a philosophical study of vampire life, try Abel Ferrara's The Addiction 1995 in B/W, with Lili Taylor, Christopher Walken, and Annabella Sciorra -- vampire gem of a tale it is.

On a horror meter, I would rate it a 10, and I can think of no other horror movie I would rate so high.

I see from imdb's listing that it should carry an R.  Do not take young children to this movie!  That said, let me assure you that the dark comedy epitaph fits it to a t-bone.  Guy Pearce is an incredible actor (remember him in Priscilla, Q of the D?  Well, you ain't ready for him in this kind of a movie.)  Capt Boyd (GP) is such a wimp, at first you're hoping he'll get consumed first -- but he's the hero, so everyone else ends up in the pot before the final confrontation between good and evil.

However, the music theme sounds like something taken from an old Nintendo game.  The actors play their parts well and as the test for survival begins, you start to wonder how it will end as some of the characters that you thought would have a big part in the film appear dead during the first hour of the film.  I wouldn't recommend this to that many people because it'd just sound like I'm psychotic since it deals with cannabalism very hard with many gory scenes throughout (the flashback of the American Mexican war is rather discusting).

It is such a subtle theme and could have been butchered onto the screen, but remains so muted that it has greater impact.A singularly unique film full of great performances, terse and biting dialogue, and quick, fast-paced direction, you're mouth will be watering, begging for more, by the end of the credits.8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"People really need to see this...","Date":"22 February 2000","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  As an example of how you _can_ make a different horror/thriller movie, without getting plain weird.

After you watched Scream, sure you thought about the film for a while but there was no meaning behind it and it fell flat on it´s face. And I´m not talking about being afraid of the boogieman in the dark. The movie got me thinking, could this really happen? I mean, we´ve all heard about cannibalism before. There must be some reason why it´s done, and I think this movie gives a good one. Although, I don´t think it´s a new theory, because I have read about it in the book The Vampire Lestat by Anne Rice. I wonder if the writer has read that book. If you watch closely you might notice in the beginning a hidden meaning in capt.

I don't feel justified calling that facet of the picture a flaw, but it's definitely there. Watching it, I felt all the elements came together GREAT as long as you didn't put each of them under a microscope, but rather pulled back and decided to let it BE a film that's weird, unsettling, funny as hell and thought-provoking. It's too bad so many viewers are trying to pigeon-hole this movie into a genre like Horror or something. It's bigger than that. The sound track deserves a damned OSCAR as far as I'm concerned.

He tells of how they started to eat the dead before others starting killing for more food and he fled. The men at the command decide to return to the place Colqhorn told them about and rescue/arrest the other survivors. However it quickly becomes apparent that Colqhorn has not told them the whole truth.When I taped this film I knew very little about it and expected a sort of horror movie with blood through it however I was thrown a little bit when the usual 'meaningful quote' was thrown up to set a serious mood but then a second quote popped up complete with comedy sound effect. This strange mix of tone continued through the whole film and it made it a bit difficult to work out what it wanted me to do. At one point it is close to thrilling as Colqhorn reveals himself for what he is and starts a chase through the woods, but the film uses a fast paced banjo music that makes the scene feel more like a Cajun version of Benny Hill than it does a violent chase. Despite this though it is interesting as a curio if not a great film in its own right with the gore appealing to those that like that sort of thing, the dark humour appealing to others and the silly but twisty plot appealing to others.For me I didn't feel any one element of the film really worked that well but that it was still worth seeing. Production wise the film is better than it deserves &#150; it looks great, the sets look real, the locations are good and things like costume etc all come together. Bird's direction was good but it is just a shame that somebody couldn't decide what they wanted this film to be &#150; even the IMDb listing for genre shows that it is listed as at least 6 different genres. It just about works but the comic touch rather undermines the horror of the story and by the end it is neither hilarious nor scary and has gore for gore's sake. The cast make what they can of it but even they seem unsure of whether this is a comedy or not. Pierce is a good leading man and has presence, playing it straight and to the core of the darkness of the subject. However Jeffrey Jones thinks he is in a tongue in cheek dark comedy and for most of it plays his role with a comic touch. Bird regular Carlyle is better, flitting between the horror and the comic rather well &#150; if only the material had given him more help in this matter. The support cast is mostly wasted (in more than one sense of the word) but the list of well-known faces is impressive; you may not know all their names but you will recognise Spencer, Davies, Arquette, McDonough and Spinella.The gore will appeal to teenage boys; the dark humour will appeal to sickos like me; the cast will appeal to many and the film generally is worth seeing once because it is such a curious little piece.

Though a part of me would love to see what a cannibal comedy would look like from the director of Home Alone 3, Big Mamma's House, Beverly Hills Chihuahua and a bunch of other crap he made. Bird does a good job directing and containing the fallout on such a troubled production, especially joining with no notice and no prep. Bird has gone on to say that the film was micro-managed by Fox 2000 executive Laura Ziskin, who was responsible for ridding the production of Manchevski, who was doing a fine job. Studio interference aside, the film doesn't look like it had production trouble - it's dark humor is intact and it's overflowing with gore. Bird has also said she lost any control of the film during editing and voice-over was added against her will as well as certain aspects being re-edited. The voice-over doesn't add a thing, but it doesn't impact the film negatively either. The film is played for laughs which is bold considering the subject matter and it does occasionally get a bit silly, but for the most part it's a well made warped comedy. Robert Carlyle is plenty over the top here, but he's never hammy, he looks deranged - so this film gets going when a famished Carlyle shows up at a outpost with a few military outcasts and it's not before long the cast is reduced to dinner for Carlyle.

Sadly, the movie doesn't answer some questions you want to know the answer and the background sound doesn't fit at times (for instance when Colqhoun killed them all outside the cave and runs after the guy that left, they strangely let it play a country jingle). But it is still watchable and interesting to see!

First tried for murder, Packer was eventually sentenced to 40 years in prison after being convicted of manslaughter.Original director Milco Mancevski left the production two weeks after shooting started. He was replaced by Bird at the suggestion of Carlyle, who had worked with Bird on the film Priest.Plot In an opening prologue during the Mexican-American War (1846 &#x96; 1848), a United States Army officer, Lieutenant Boyd, freezes in battle while his unit is massacred. Playing dead, he is transported along with the other dead, with his commanding officer's blood dripping into his mouth, back to the Mexican headquarters. In a moment of sudden bravery, he captures the Mexican command. He is promoted to Captain for his heroism, but his commanding officer realizes he is a coward and transfers him to the remote Fort Spencer in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.After Boyd joins the seven other inhabitants of Fort Spencer, a stranger named Colqhoun arrives and describes his wagon train becoming lost in the Sierra Nevadas and being reduced to cannibalism to avoid starvation. The party's guide, a Colonel Ives, had promised the party a shorter route to the Pacific Ocean but instead led them on a more circuitous route, and was then the one to lead their turn to cannibalism. The soldiers stationed at the fort see it as their duty to investigate and search for survivors, and so assemble a rescue party. Before they leave they are warned by their Native American scout, George, of the Wendigo myth; a story that a man consuming the flesh of his enemies takes their strength but becomes a demon cursed by a hunger for human flesh.When they reach the cave where the party had taken refuge they realize that Colqhoun is Ives and has lured them into a trap. He had killed his five companions and sets about killing the soldiers from Fort Spencer one by one, including the commanding officer, Colonel Hart.Boyd manages to escape the massacre by jumping off a cliff, breaking his leg in the process. He hides in a pit along with the body of a fellow soldier and eventually he eats some of the man's flesh to stay alive. When he finally limps back into the fort he is delirious and severely traumatized; none of the remaining soldiers (who did not meet Colqhoun) believe his wild tale, and a second expedition finds no bodies or any trace of the man. A temporary commander is assigned to the fort and to Boyd's horror it turns out to be Colqhoun, now cleaned up and calling himself Colonel Ives. The others still refuse to believe that Ives is the killer, especially after he bears no sign of the wounds inflicted on him during the massacre.Ives tells Boyd that he used to suffer from tuberculosis, but when a Native scout told him the Wendigo myth he just had to try, murdering him, eating his flesh and in the process curing his maladies. Having murdered the expedition he led he now plans to use the fort as a base to do the same to other passing travelers; he compares the location of the fort, with the guaranteed supply of isolated migrants that it entails, to the notion of Manifest Destiny that draws them there.Boyd is suspected of murder after another soldier mysteriously dies and is chained up; he watches helplessly while the last officer is murdered by an unexpected ally of Ives Colonel Hart, back from the dead after the massacre.Ives saved Hart by feeding him his own comrades, and now Hart is addicted, like Colqhoun, to human meat. Ives wounds Boyd and forces him to make a choice eat or die. Eventually Boyd gives in and eats a stew made out of the last officer killed, and his wound heals. But rather than join the two men in their conspiracy to convert General Slauson (who assigned Boyd to Fort Spencer in the first place), he convinces Hart to free him so he can kill Ives. Hart does so, but asks Boyd to kill him first as he no longer wants to live as a cannibal. A battle between Boyd and Ives takes place at the climax, with both men wounding each other badly, yet they won't die easily due to their new powers. Finally, Boyd forces Ives onto a large bear trap and springs it, pinning them both together. Ives taunts Boyd by telling him he'll eat him as soon as he dies, but Ives expires first. Boyd refuses to save himself by eating Ives' body and dies on top of his adversary.Martha, George's sister, stumbles upon the bodies of both Ives and Boyd, closes the door, and walks away. In the last scene, General Slauson arrives. While his aide looks around, the general is seen tasting the stew that was left on the fire, suggesting that he might unwittingly be carrying forward the Wendigo curse.Bottom line if you are looking for a cannibal film, look no further.

Despite a clearly limited budget, The film does a fine job I think of putting you in the period. This is a dirty mucky environment, very cold, with little for warmth or light except torches and the occasional cooking fire. Ravenous keeps the viewer going by taking several interesting turns. It's got quite a substantial plot, and in fact it might actually be too substantial for a hundred minutes. Ravenous feels a bit underwritten, it denies a sense of motivation I think. I've seen movies fall into this trap, luckily Ravenous doesn't fall nearly as hard, but it does get progressively ridiculous. Maybe that's a good think.

Cannibalism in films is often hard to find as it is in the real world these days. And although this film could have been truly terrifying if played straight, the black comedic style also serves it well in parts. Ravenous is a story dealing with cannibalism, and its effects on those who practice it. If the legends we hear in this film are indeed true, then we'd probably see a lot more of it. The setting of the story is also a nice change from the norm in most horror movies. Most of the action is played out in the wilderness near a tiny army outpost in California during the 1840s. Considering a true story of cannibalism did play out in this geographical area once, that makes this story all the more eerie.Guy Pearce plays an army officer recently decorated for valor during the Mexican-American War. We know right off the bat that he was in fact a coward who just happened to stumble into circumstances that allowed him to capture an enemy unit. It isn't clear just how, but soon his superior officers find out he's a fraud and ship him out to tiny Fort Spencer located in high up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Through flashbacks, we learn that Pearce had acted as a coward during battle and played dead. His body was stacked into a cart with other American dead and taken back to the Mexican fort. Pearce ingests blood from his dead comrades, and then becomes brave and invincible. Soon, he captures the enemy position all by himself. But this deed actually winds up getting him exiled to the tiny fort populated with some truly odd characters. And things are just getting started. Shortly after his arrival, a drifter claiming to be from a doomed wagon train shows up telling wild tales of cannibalism and hinting that some members of the party may still be in danger. Its obvious to us that this drifter is not telling us the whole truth. But yes, he is a cannibal and soon he is urging Pearce to join him at the buffet table! Much of the cast either becomes food or becomes a cannibal as the action plays out in some truly grotesque ways.The film is often too silly for its own good, but there are some very memorable moments. Robert Carlyle as the mysterious drifter walks away with this film, literally chewing the actors and scenery to bits. The soundtrack is oddly unique, just like most of the picture. The cast is full of quirky character actors like David Arquette, Jeffrey Jones, and Jeremy Davies. The mountain scenery is very beautiful as this was filmed in eastern Europe. It was a nice touch casting a vegetarian like Pearce as a man who has to eat human flesh on three occasions in order to survive in this film. This film is a decent effort and a nice gory diversion from your standard run of the mill torture based horror film which are all too common these days. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.

After receiving his new rank, his commanding officer addresses Boyd's cowardice during field operations and transfers him to a remote fort situated in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Upon arriving, Boyd listens to a tale of cannibalism by a delirious man by the name of Colqhoun,(Robert Carlyle) who stumbles into the fort in search of assistance. Colqhoun and the rest of his traveling party were lost in the wilderness and resorted to cannibalism to avoid starvation.This film was actually recommended to me by a friend and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, considering Steve hates every movie on the planet. Viewers of this film have drawn parallels to the Donner party, a grim tale of cannibalism in the 1800's that made history. I'm not well versed on that topic, but from what I do know about it, I can see the similarities. I wouldn't classify this movie as pure horror - it seems more like a thriller but we all know how fine that line is. There are several tense moments and forks in the road to keep things intriguing; leading up to a closing act that wraps things up nicely, even leaving the viewer something to think about further.So should you, or should you not watch Ravenous? Well...I can't think of too many movies that involve 1800's cannibalism while blending old Native American folklore, so I'm going to give the go-ahead on this one. There are plenty of gun fights and action sequences to entertain the most lighthearted of movie-goers while offering a dark side that will appeal to the horror fanatic.

What do you expect when you see the film's synopsis, to be honest you expect a run of the mill Hollywood flick. Yet what you get is not such a thing, whilst the film definitely is a very Typical piece of Anerican film making, it does have a few interesting and different tricks up it's sleeve. I would say that it is an enjoyable picture, but it has sone very obvious and irritating flaws, although I'm able to suspend my disbelief for the duration of the film, it is not without some difficulty, which is somewhat surprising as there are many other films with far stranger plots that I find easier to be pulled into.Robert Carlyle, for me, is the best thing about this film. His acting is great, whatever scene he is in he manages to bring real life and energy to, which is something the lead seems to lack. The lead is obviously supposed to be a coward and a wimp, I am however unsure wheter the actor manages to pull this off. In many ways he seems subdued overly quiet and looks like a fish out of water, I am however inclined to think that this has nothing to do with his portrayal of the character, but more to do with his inabillity to act. My personal favourite scene is the fight on top of the mountain, where Carlyle reveals his true, if not somewhat obvious, colours. The scene is cleverly shot, making use of a wide range of interesting angles, I noticed a 'Vertigo' shot, the famous zoom in and tack back shot. The music is also fun and adds a lot to the pace of the film. Although at moments, it seemed to remind me of the Benny Hill music, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as I don't think the film was supposed to be taken entirely seriously.The films concept, cannibalism, has been used in so many films that it often becomes boring, and unexciting. I have seen a lot of films where the fact that Humans eat other Humans is supposed to be scary, that usually when people try to do it, it becomes a snooze fest. However with Ravenous, I think that they have managed to change the basic idea of cannibalism about a bit, so that there is a at least an interesting plot playing out on screen, and not just humans eating. Whilst definitely not the greatest film I have seen, it is a long way from being the worse. Like I say it is an enjoyable film, it doesn't get too bogged down, and it moves forward at a good pace. It does have numerous flaws, like being shot in a blue tone, which I could really see little or no reason for. Overall I would say a solidly average film, it can never be more that that, but honestly I don't think it even wanted to be.7/10 "},{"Title":"Crafty mix of horror, black comedy and pure awesome","Date":"30 January 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Some people watch horror from the 70s or 80s and like to claim that they don't make them like that anymore.

It's one of the best-photographed movies I've seen in a long time, and not just because of the entrails and caked blood. The movie looks cold to the bone, even inside the snow-laden huts and buildings that make up isolated Fort Spencer. The director, Antonia Bird, gives us strong story telling. The horror and the prospects of what we'll see are matched with restrained plotting and persuasive acting. The situation is outlandish and we can't help but smile at how cleverly Bird serves it up on a plate for us. At the same time, what happens to the characters isn't funny at all. It's Grand Guignol in the snow. The movie is set in the late 1840's, high in the California Sierra Nevada mountains. Fort Spencer is a small outpost, with only eight men. Three are important to us. The rest are important for other reasons. There's Captain Boyd (Guy Pearce), who was a coward in the Mexican-American War. He wound up in a pile of corpses, their blood tricking into his mouth, but eventually did a heroic deed. He was awarded a medal and then promptly sent to the isolated Fort Spencer. There's Colonel Hart (Jeffrey Jones), the commanding officer of the detachment's seven men. And there is the ragged man (Robert Carlyle) who, one frigid night, nearly out of his mind and nearly dead of the cold, staggers to the fort. He says he is F. W. Colqhoun. He has quite a tale to tell. Part of it is true. The other part? Think of an old Indian legend that when one dines on another person, one gathers in that other person's strength. A bite of liver, a chew of thigh will set up a man for days with good humor and virility...heals wounds and cures sickness, too. Whether California will be populated by settlers and gold prospectors or by military cannibals depends on a coward who is trying to fight his inclinations. That brings us to the showdown battle between two men who, having dined recently, have great strength. It's a battle that is loaded with big-fight, gruesome clichés. The movie is so sly and original that it's a shame it is stuck with a climax that is so predictably groan-slash-slice-stab-squirt. The final scene, involving a general and a pot of stew, seemed to me to be just a cheap final laugh. It made pointless Colonel Hart's integrity and Captain Boyd's bravery. It undercut the reason for the two men's final actions. Robert Carlyle chews the snowy scenery but he's a fine actor. Guy Pearce has the tough job of being a frightened coward, yet brave and honorable when it comes down to it. Jeffrey Jones' as Colonel Hart gives the most intriguing performance, in my view. Hart looks like a disintegrating, heavy-set buffoon when we first meet him. He turns out to be a competent, thoughtful, well-educated officer who knows his men, knows himself and knows his job. And he knows the horror he's become. Jones gives a dramatic, ironic, likable performance. Ravenous is a first-class movie with a second-class ending.

The only film I can think to compare it with, both in style and substance, is the genre-defying classic The Wicker Man.Capt. Boyd (Guy Pearce) has just been honoured for his heroic part in a battle of the Mexican-American War (1846-48). But at the celebratory dinner, he cannot eat a rare beef steak. For this faux pas, his incredulous commanding officer sends him to a dilapidated, marginal outpost in California, Fort Spencer, run by a bunch of misfits unfit for service elsewhere. As he settles into the highly odd rhythms of this particular camp's life, a mysterious man (Robert Carlyle) arrives, telling a strange tale of cannibalism, which the band of misfits who make up Fort Spencer reluctantly decide to investigate.The basic idea behind Ravenous is that eating animal flesh is akin to eating human flesh. The film shows that it is basically the same, once you know it came from something which had a life, and was killed for your nourishment, be it human or animal (not surprising to know, therefore, that director Antonia Bird is a vegetarian).Ravenous, with the aid of an invented native American myth, the 'Wendigo', that a man who eats the flesh of another becomes superhuman and his appetite for cannibalism insatiable, takes this maxim to its extreme, creating a demi monde where eating 'pot roast a la Knox', is quite normal and rational, in the pragmatic sense. Capt. Boyd however, runs counter to the frontier tradition of hardy pragmatism, i.e. a blasé attitude to life and humanity (gunfights, massacre) in that he is a man with different, more modern sensibilities to your average mid-nineteenth century American man heading west. He abhors war to such an extent he suffers post traumatic stress disorder. In the times he lives in, he is easily confused (and confuses himself) as a coward, but is put to the test in extreme circumstances.Along with this clash of mid-nineteenth century and modern sensibilities, is that of westward expansionism. Here the film cleverly adds to its brilliantly imaginative commentary on carnivorism, by making in the insatiable cannibalism inspired by the native American myth of the 'Wendigo', a highly critical allegory of American attitudes towards Manifest Destiny, the irrepressible, inexorable expansion westwards of the 'white man' across the continent.All this could sound terrible arty, anachronistic and contrived, but the film is crafted so carefully and well, and with such verve, it is also highly enjoyable and thrilling. The dialogue is wonderful and subtly funny. The action is bloody and well-handled, with oddly idiosyncratic twists. The mixing of genres, western, horror and comedy, is seamless, and the film is aided with a wonderfully idiosyncratic soundtrack by the unlikely partnership of Michael Nyman and Damon Albarn. Lastly, but of course not least, the acting is roundly excellent, but the leads, Pearce and Carlyle are both brilliant. Pearce is in sync with the modern sensibilities of his character without making his character feel anachronistic, while Carlyle adds to his repertoire of extreme characters with a double performance that shows great daring and range.

Two, this movie has some of the best music written for a film like this. The music incorporates a very folky sound with a mix of bizarre repeating samples that give some of the best scenes a really creepy feel. Three, the story line is so much more than just a cannibal film. Many people have their interpretations, I think the film is about drug addiction.

That obligatory joke out of the way, I will say that this one seems to have flown under most people's radar screens.  And I find that somewhat surprising, as it's pretty much your run-of-the-mill mainstream homoerotic political satire staged as a vampire story in Gold Rush drag.  Oh, wait, that's exactly why.It seems a lot of books and movies involving cannibalism wind up being satiric (think of Romero's `Living Dead' movies, `Eating Raoul,' `Parents,' `The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover,' `Delicatessen,' etc.).  I suppose the metaphor of eating one's fellow man is just too tempting for the satirist to pass up (too appetizing?  Mouth-watering?  OK, I promise to stop.).I won't spoil anything, but the satire of the U.S.'s expansionist policies (the movie's set during the Polk administration, but its message is more relevant than ever) is very smart.  And it's wrapped up in a spooky, very old-fashioned we're-stuck-in-the-middle-of-nowhere-with-nothing-to-eat story.  When it came out, some reviewers compared it to Poe, but it reminded me much more of Ambrose Bierce, both in its horror and its political subtext.The aesthetic elements are well-realized and stylish.  Both Guy Pearce, who barely speaks, and Robert Carlyle, in the meatier acting part (there I go again, sorry), are quite convincing, and they're given terrific support by Jeffrey Jones, John Spencer, and Sheila Tousey.  The cinematography, with central European mountains standing in for the High Sierras, is gorgeous.  And the score, a collaboration between Michael Nyman and Blur's Damon Albarn, is nothing short of brilliant--idiosyncratic and ironic, but completely appropriate and effective and American-sounding at the same time.  It's easily Nyman's best work since his collaborations with Peter Greenaway.It's not a perfect movie by any standard.  Not all the acting is subtle--an unrecognizable Jeremy Davies is quite horrible, and David Arquette is wasted.  Most of the jokes are played admirably straight, but one or two of them are cringeworthy (a single line--`That was really sneaky'--nearly ruins the whole film).  And you do come away wishing the screenwriter had had a better ear for 19th-century dialogue.  But I'm inclined to forgive these faults, and in fact the movie actually improves on repeat viewing.  It's a fun, scary story, and a smart, scary political fable.  It's highly recommended, though, of course, it's not going to be . . . for all tastes, a ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Oh, forget it.  8 out of 10.

It actually seems to try to be bad. The beginning is interesting, (if you exclude the stomach-churning scene in which heros of war literally suck up their meat.) The story does not hold together at all. It is totally unbelievable and often confusing. Although the theme of man eats another man to live and becomes addicted to human flesh is interesting, the plot is full of holes and leaves the viewer in a state of confusion and disgust. As I've said before, if the script stinks, nothing will save the movie. This one was dead before filming began.*Spoilers*Boyd has just been awarded for being a coward in battle. He faked death to save his own life as his men were shot. However, he did manage to sneak into the enemy's camp and save the day. Now he's been promoted and brought to a nothing fort for God-knows what reason. While there, a stranger, Ives, appears in the camp and claims that he and the rest of his wagon train got lost and began to starve in the wilderness. In order to survive, they ate the flesh of the dead. When their guide begins to  kill the living, Ives tells how he made a run for it and wound up at the fort, however, he left two others behind. Feeling patriotic, Boyd and the other camp members decide to go take a look-see. To no one's surprise, Ives isn't what he appears to be and goes on a killing spree leaving no one but Boyd alive. So, of course, no one believes Boyd when he tells of the events. That's when Ives reappears, but in a new fashion and begins his rampage yet again, and no one has knowledge of his true identity except Boyd. And now Boyd begins to feel the urge to taste human flesh. Can he stop himself? Will he hold back? Can he save the others!?...... Who cares? None of the characters are worth caring about. (Except poor Toffler... but he did whine a little too much.)*More Spoilers*What a waste of talent! I am a fan of Guy Pearce, David Carlyle, and Jeremy Davies... but, dear God, what were they thinking!? The plot was terrible (Ives' return as an officer. Where'd that come from?), the acting left something to be desired (Thank you David Arquette. We can always count on you.), and I guess the director thought more blood means bigger audience.

While most other films that mix humour and gore (e.g. Very Bad Things) deliver the funny parts in a equally gross way as the bloody bits, Ravenous avoids such clichés. Underneath the plot is a black-humoured and mordant satire, mostly subtle, although in the end Colonel Ives makes it a bit too clear that it's manifest destiny and the violent expansion of mankind that's being criticized. Carlyle gives a fabulous cannibal. The scene at the cave where he's frantically shivering, lustfully anticipating his meal, made me bite my nails. Some of the other reviews thought Guy Pearce did a bad job as the weary Captain Boyd. Quite on the contrary his performance is as convincing as Carlyle's. Even though he's not very talkative Boyd gains depth merely by the haunted facial expression and those tortured looks Pearce produces. Boyd may not be your average hero, but when you think about the end it becomes clear he's no coward either.  Even David Arquette managed not to irritate me as he usual does, his depiction of a 19th century pothead was actually quite funny.The film was shot in Slovakia and shows us some beautiful (because authentic) landscapes. As a previous comment said the scenery isn't some sugar-coated version of reality; it makes you feel the harsh, cold and snowy weather. This backdrop makes it a easy to understand why someone would actually retreat to cannibalism when they've run out of food. The score is great (Damon Albarn proving that there's more to him than Britpop) and gives the film a kind of soul and softens it a bit up. The end title, an altered version of Boyd's Journey is simply beautiful.Ravenous is a parable, not just of social-darwinistic expansionism, but in general terms of courage and morals, too. But beware While watching some of the scenes it occured to me that Antonia Bird (the director) must be a vegetarian. The way meat and flesh (even outside of violent scenes) were shown made me think twice about having a hamburger in the near future. All in all and undeservedly overlooked and underrated movie. Maybe the general audience thought it was a splatter film/western/thriller/comedy whatever. While Ravenous consists of all these elements it would be wrong (and futile) to try and label it as any of the above. If anything it is a satirical horror drama/tragicomedy ;-) Well, maybe it shouldn't be labelled at all. Just go and watch it for yourself. You'll be surprised.

It deals with the feelings of the human mind and soul when confronted with difficult situations such as death. In this film we see flesh as something that revives a human and gives him power. Something like blood for vampires. The only thing that is needed for one to enjoy flesh, is to kill the feeling of guilt. The true villain of this film is the human mind. I really enjoyed this film because it gave me something to think about. It is well directed, beautifully acted and has some very shocking scenes.

If you're graphic, it can turn people off.  If you're not, the rest of us complain that you chickened out on the subject. `Ravenous' wants to have it both ways.  Half the time, it's a confused, but wonderfully made black comedy.  The other half is a bloody thriller about the healing effects that can occur after eating the flesh of another man.  Trouble is, the blood is shed is great amounts, but we never really see the cannibalism.  Trey Parker's dynamite sillyfest `Cannibal!  The Musical' was a lot betterat showing guys gnawing on legs and arms.  Another huge problem with `Ravenous' is that it's not funny, at all.  Not one good chuckle is to be had here. Instead the film chooses to stop the action periodically to spell out the symbolism of the movie. It grinds the picture to a halt for which it has to slowly start up again.Good actors like Robert Carlyle, Guy Pearce, and Jeffrey Jones are left with nothing to but just sit there while director Antonia Bird pours large amounts of blood on them.  I grew more tired of `Ravenous' as it went on.  I kept thinking what kind of film would it have been if they just went for it.  A full-out bloody gorefest, like the material seems like to wants to be. That would be both unexpected and rousing. Instead, the film before me just kind of sits there, falsely believing it's devilish.------------ 4  "},{"Title":"Doesn't quite work, oddly","Date":"21 December 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" The film changes its tone twice - firstly, its quite atmospheric and there's some mystery, then the story becomes more action oriented, and finally there's a rear window-type thing going on.

The stations commanding officer is Colonel Hart(Jeffrey Jones, in one of his best roles), a man quite easy to like, with manners to match an unwavering wit, who leads a motley crew of misfits which includes two Indians(..who came with the place.),George(Joseph Runningfox) & Martha(Sheila Tousey), a pot-smoking private, Cleaves(David Arquette), a very serious, intimidating & aggressive military man, Reich(Neal McDonough), a quietly mumbling priest, Toffler(Jeremy Davies, a method acting wannabee, who never ceases to annoy me), and a drunk doc, Knox(Stephen Spinella). A mysterious man(Robert Carlyle), calling himself Colqhoun, arrives at their camp nearly dead from the cold and starvation who talks about a group he'd traveled with succumbing to the harsh climate and cannibalism. When Colqhoun brings to light the possibility that two of his group might still be alive, Hart instantly rises to lead an expedition to the cave where they were last seen. What the group doesn't realize is that there's more to Colqhoun that meets the eye.Through director Antonia Bird, cannibalism is explored with grisly delight..this is indeed both a dark comedy and a full-blooded horror tale. I found a joy operating within the film's darkness. I do think the film will be divided between those who buy into the supernatural ingredient, which enables those who eat human flesh to literally become superhuman, and those who'll consider the premise rubbish, rolling their eyes at what transpires as the film continues. I think specifically the battle of the titans conclusion will definitely have certain viewers shaking their heads in disbelief. I didn't realize that the film would actually be heading in that supernatural direction, but it seemed fitting since the overall tone embellished such wickedly morbid humor through the macabre elements of the story. I found the dialogue particularly amusing, and there's a relish in the story-telling regarding cannibalism and it's powers. I found the excuse to eat human flesh through quotes from Ben Franklin(Eat to live..don't live to eat. & Waste not..want not.)..in a lip-smacking dinner sequence..quite humorous in a sick, twisted manner. The film, for me, remains a jolly good time, as poor Boyd must convince others that the group were eaten by a cannibalistic savage, while finding himself in quite a dilemma when the one that ate his fellow men becomes the fort's new colonel! What makes the overall experience quite memorable for me, besides the unusual premise itself, is the setting in such uncompromising conditions and music which certainly adds to the mood of the film. The film is also quite grisly and unpleasant as we see how the cannibalistic villain embraces his lifestyle and it's benefits. There's also a twist towards the end which adds spice to the proceedings..our hero realizes that his nemesis has a partner(It's lonely being a cannibal. Tough making friends.).

Now he's been promoted and brought to a nothing fort for God-knows what reason. While there, a stranger, Ives, appears in the camp and claims that he and the rest of his wagon train got lost and began to starve in the wilderness.

That's when Ives reappears, but in a new fashion and begins his rampage yet again, and no one has knowledge of his true identity except Boyd.

An interesting idea of kill or be killed is the basic premise of this movie, but then it goes off on a tangent, bringing in the morality of Aristotle and Native American lore, which are not made to sit very well in the plot.   A few famous quotes, like Ben Franklin's eat to live, not live to eat, uttered by Carlyle as he eats a stewed comrade, are thrown in as awkward attempts at humor-- but overall,the film cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be a serious psychological thriller, or a corny gore-fest.  Carlyle camps it up as Col. Ives, but his character, like the others, is flat and unexciting.  I was in pain watching Guy Pearce try his best to bring some believability to the role of Capt. Boyd, but as tremendously talented as he is, it would have taken a miracle to make something out of the drivel these actors were given to work with.  Although I was at times shocked and somewhat scared, one look at Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the lambs chilled me more than all the horror elements in this film, taken all together.

The movie is not solely in the black comedy column. In the last act, we have a mixture. The main cannibal-in-chief delivers line after line after line of above-it-all humor as he seeks to enlarge his entourage, poking fun at the whole enterprise of eating other people to gain strength. But as he does this, the Guy Pearce character, borderline and wavering at times throughout the movie in terms of his resolve, is dead serious in putting an end to the cannibal situation. And further comedy occurs when the general arrives and happens to taste the human stew, which does seem to be habit-forming because it imparts strength.The beginning of the film, however, is much more serious in eliciting some horror moments and suspense. Even the middle has its moments. So we have horror becoming black comedy, not an easily integrated mixture. One can read themes into this picture, but at best there is some superficial tossing around of classical philosophic quests versus the appetites of men.The picture is quite off-putting for the great majority of viewers, I would imagine, who will wonder what this is possibly about. I could only wonder why anyone would want to write such a story or film it. It's not something the average person is going to want to watch once a year.Granted there are horror fans who revel in new and grotesque sights on film, this has that novelty and shock value.As a film, I see this as overall average or below. It does what it does well enough, and certainly the acting is fine and photography fine. It creates plenty of atmosphere. But the story is a letdown. Horrid behavior cannot sustain a movie and make it good. Where's this movie's heart and soul? It seems to have disappeared into the stew.

The Fort leader Colonel Hart reluctantly tells the team to mobilise so that they may investigate, not out of heroism but because 'it's our job'.Along the way to the destination the wide eyed Calhoun tells the travellers that he reluctantly himself consumed human flesh to simply stave off starvation, but was amazed at the recuperative powers that it gave him and the team, some however found eating the others like Pringles Chips - once you pop, you can't stop...What ensues is an enjoyably over the top - yet wickedly dark - piece of horror with lashings of gleeful hammery, one that will make sure you never look at the thick chunks in stew the same way ever again.There are a couple of nifty twists and turns though nothing that is too self-important or unnecessarily complicated. Ravenous is a film that knows what it wants to be and mercifully stays within its own boundaries, actually revelling in its own oozing and poking fun at the very dark subject matter that fills the film.Robert Carlyle (remember him?) obviously has fun with his role, and there are several other supporting roles with little to do but remain interesting until the main course begins. Pearce remains a straight man in this sea of silliness, though that's not to say he doesn't get good n bloody when the situation demands.Special mention to the uniquely anti-music that rattles along during key scenes in the film, part charming and part off kilter randomness, it is nonetheless effective.Final Rating - 6 / 10.

Ravenous builds it's premise around some silly ancient Native American legend which states that if one eats human flesh, the eater gets the spirit of the eatee. Having someone in the attic calling the babysitter in the living room on the phone threatening to disembowel her is much more probable. Additionally, the film is fraught with peculiar incongruities, such as one run-for-your-life scene which is accompanied by up tempo banjo music which could have been the theme from The Beverly Hillbillies. Ravenous wears itself out with its thin plot and 100 min run time. The last half hour or so seems little more than people running around drooling blood as nauseam such that when the film ends the audience is numb and bored. A waste of time, talent, money.

His cheeky, ill-written one liners were performed with such inappropriate melodrama I wanted to laugh out loud.

The film, aside from being an excellent horror movie, is also a metaphor of Benjamin Franklin's proverb; Eat to live, don't live to eat, and it probes into the immoral side of the human mind through that. The plot follows the story of army captain, John Boyd, who wins promotion through defeating the enemy command in the Mexican-American war. However, due to his actions stemming from an act of cowardice, he is given a promotion as third in command at a rubbish base; Fort Spencer. When a stranger named Colquhoun turns up at the base, frost bitten and close to death; he tells his disturbing story; one of starvation and cannibalism.Three very good actors head the cast of Ravenous. Guy Pierce, who really is underrated, gives a great performance here as the cowardly army captain John Boyd; he creates just the right atmosphere for his character and therefore we are able to feel empathetic towards him when he finds himself in an unenviable position later on in the film. The second starring performance comes from Robert Carlyle; a man who has gotten a name for himself by playing unstable characters, and this movie features another of those performances. I don't think they could have cast the part of Colquhoun any better; Carlysle does the insane madman side of his character admirably, and he also manages to get the other side of the character; that of an immoral and emotionless human being spot on too. The third starring role is lesser than the other two, but comes from Jeffrey Jones. Jones has been in a few well-known movies, such as Sleepy Hollow; another 1999 horror movie, and yet has never really won any acclaim. I recognised him in the movie, but I didn't know his name.One of the best things about Ravenous is the music, which is played almost constantly throughout the film. This collaborates with the images on screen brilliantly; bringing a great atmosphere to the film as the music changes with the mood. The music makes the images on screen more powerful and memorable as it fuses so well. Another thing about Ravenous is it's abundant comedy angle; from the start of the film I thought I was in for an absurd black comedy, and I was half right as the film does feature several moments of comedy alongside it's buckets of gore and disgusting make-up effects. The comedy in the movie isn't misplaced either and it overall makes for a very strange feel to the film, which is most definitely to the movie's credit.Ravenous is a unique, darkly comic and very gory movie, and should please horror movie fans no end and this film therefore comes with the highest recommendation.

Apparently this movie thinks that it does not have to be good as long as it has a part-time sense of humor and gore that will shock some people.  I did not see too much gore, and the humor was not that good.  This movie bored the life out of me.This movie is not anything disgusting, so the gore hounds will be disappointed.  This movie also isn't that funny, and I thought Very Bad Things was hilarious.  The only cool guy, Pike, leaves in the first half of the movie.  By the time the first half is over, you are like, that was a simple movie.  Then things get slower, and longer, and by the end, you are ready to jump to Carrie 2, which I have not seen at time of writing.  The contrasts are blinding between the dark caves and huts, and the blinding snow, making you annoyed the more it is used.  The acting is not very convincing, although I liked Carlyle for some strange reason.The premise is overdone, having movies like Cannibal, the musical!  The plot is tedious, based on some ancient indian myth.  The gore is less than what you can get in a cheesy horror movie at home, and the laughs do not come out.I cannot recommend this except for the masochistic and curious. If you are curious by the trailer, rent the trailer and watch it many times, and you will have seen a better movie than the actual one.  This movie is also insulting to my intelligence, especially when a retarded quote from Ben Franklin, Eat to live, don't live to eat, is treated like miracle dialogue. -30 out of 10.

OK period horror.","Date":"1 May 2006","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Fantasy, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Ravenous is set during the 1847 Mexican-American civil war where Capatin John Boyd (Guy Pearce) is found out to be a coward & sent to Fort Spencer in California deep in the Western Sierra Nevadas, a station for travellers in the middle of nowhere run by a bunch of social rejects & misfits. It's John's first night there & he notices a man outside, the man is helped inside the fort & given medical treatment. The man identifies himself as Colqhoun (Robert Carlyle) & that he was a member of an ill-fated party of prospectors who were caught out by the harsh winter, they all took shelter in a cave but quickly ran out of food. Colqhoun then says that they turned to cannibalism to survive as they began to die from malnutrition... Colonel Hart (Jeffery Jones) organises an expedition to search for any other possible survivors, Colqhoun, John, Private Reich (Neal McDonough), Private Toffler (Jeremy Davis) & an Indian named George (Joseph Runningfox) head off to the cave to see what horror lie within. Once there they quickly discover that Colqhoun's story is a lie & he is the cannibal, a cannibal who can't get enough human flesh to satisfy his hunger...Directed by Antonia Bird I thought Ravenous was an OK film but didn't quite do enough for me. The script by Ted Griffin is a bit of a mess when you think about it, there are supernatural elements involved which are never fully explained, the character's are a bit thin as Boyd hardly says a word throughout the entire film which make sit almost impossible to care about him & the Colonel Ives character is sketchy to say the least, if he was indeed a Colonel what was he doing stuck in a cave in the middle of nowhere? Is Ravenous a horror film, or is it a historical drama, a thriller or maybe a black comedy? I think it tries to all of these things but doesn't quite manage to strike the right balance between any of them. There are scenes of people bing miraculously healed & a stupid bit when Boyd jumps of a cliff & survives (I don't care that those trees broke his fall, from the height he jumped he would have died). There are some decent ideas here & in the right hands it might have made for an effective horror, the twist involving Colqhoun & the subsequent confrontations between himself & Boyd could have been great but instead the best the film can do is have Boyd shut a book loudly next to Boyd so as to make him jump, great stuff. I was also seriously disappointed with the cannibal aspects of the story, it's only ever really talked about & I was hoping to see some nice gore, it never happened. Having said all that the film is pretty fun to watch, there's a fair bit to it, there's some decent plot twist's, it's something a bit different, it moves along at a fair pace & it kept me watching right through to the end if nothing else.Director Bird was the third choice to direct & a last minute replacement for Milcho Manchevski who only lasted two weeks into production, she does a fine job & captures the Czech Republic & Slovakian (where it was filmed in reality) scenery very well. There isn't much in the way of shocks or scares & while some say Ravenous is a very gory film I have to disagree, there is not one scene in Ravenous of someone engaging in cannibalism, well there is one brief bit but it turns out to be a dream sequence so it doesn't count, the stew scene doesn't count either as it looks like normal stew. There's a gory bit at the end when Major Knox (Stephen Spinella) is killed & chopped up on a chopping block but it lasts for a few seconds at most, the rest of the gore in Ravenous consists of some skeletons with bits of flesh & gristle hanging off, some dead animals, a couple of people with their stomachs cut open, a whole lot of fake blood & the best gore scene when someone has their throat slashed open with much blood spurtage as a result.With a fairly restrained budget of about $12,000,000 Ravenous still had a decent amount of cash to play with, the film is undoubtedly well made, the costumes & period settings look authentic enough & it has that Hollywood polish about it. The music in Ravenous seems to divide opinion, personally I hated it, it ruins certain scenes that with appropriate music could have been so much more effective. The acting was alright, Pearce hardly says a word & just walks around in a world of his own most of the time, Carlyle is great as the villain. David Arquette as Private Cleaves is barely in it despite almost top billing.Overall I was a bit disappointed by Ravenous, I don't buy the metaphor's, messages & moral dilemmas that the film seems to suggest as I couldn't take it that seriously. I think it's well worth a watch & is an entertaining film but ultimately it could have been so much better, good but not brilliant.

It makes the movie entertaining but also keeps the other more exciting and mysterious moments of the movie powerful and thrilling.Robert Carlyle is especially good as the main 'villain' and Guy Pearce is also highly believable in his role as cowardly captain during the Mexican-American war. The two of them really carry this movie and are supported by an highly talented supporting cast consisting out of; the always enjoyable Jeffrey Jones, Jeremy Davies in a typical role for him, David Arquette in an highly amusing role and Neal McDonough, now better known perhaps for his role in Band of Brothers and Minority Report.If you're in for something totally new and refreshing and/or you are a fan of the horror genre this is simply a must see for you!

John Boyd (Memento's Guy Pearce) gets promoted, but when Gen. Slauson (John Spencer) discovers his cowardice, he decides instead to send him to Fort Spencer, where he is third in command of a bunch of men, including Pvt. Cleaves (Scream's David Arquette), Pvt.

Boyd is the only victim left alive escaping him, but when he gets back to the civilisation of the General, he is shocked to see him again, as Col. Ives. But it is not just Carlyle that might be the cannibal, Boyd had temptations (or possibly did) to eat people, and Carlyle is trying to tempt him, but in the end they both die together, after a quite long fight, in a giant bear trap. I suppose in some ways it was inventive, but it just isn't the cannibal based horror film I was expecting. Worth watching! "}]
