[{"Title":"Not my Friends....","Date":"11 May 1999","Score":"4 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Comedy","Review":"  Friends And Lovers Trashed by every critic, and deservedly so.  This comedy features the oddest tone of a feature film in some time.  It's silly, it's deeply dramatic, it's sexually explicit, it's shockingly amateurish... It's everything!Stephen Baldwin, Allison Eastwood, Danny Nucci, George Newbern, David Rasche, and Claudia Schiffer head the cast of friends who gather at a ski chalet during the holidays.  The share life lessons, deep secrets, and raging hormones over the course of two days. It's real easy to see why actors would want to be in this.  Friends is the type of film that's very actor friendly.  Director George Haas lets his cast have free reign over their performances, often resulting in self-conscious acting.  I was drawn to this for two reasons, Schiffer being the first.  I was curious about her acting (this being her second starring role, the first in a Able Ferrara film that has yet to find American distribution - actual proof that there is a God).  Needless to say, she stinks.  She just doesn't have the chops for the big screen.  The other reason I attended this was for Robert Downey Jr's hilarious performance as a German ski instructor named Hans.  He's the lone bright spot in this bizarre film. Some dramatics between Newbern and Rasche work well too, they just seem from a different movie.  The locations are nice, and the technical credits are appropriate. Plus when isn't it a good thing to see a schlocky old fashion 1987 ski montage complete with squealing guitars?  Anyone?  This wasn't terrible to sit through, but it is a bad film. Just one of those movies that come around that makes you think just how much blow was passed around to get it made.------ 3  "},{"Title":"What a mess, what a mess, what a mighty big mess...","Date":"12 December 2001","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Romance, Comedy","Review":"  Gees, what a film. Basically, a lot of friends (and enemies?) on a skiing holiday togheter. The result of the film is pretty much that all the wrong people end up in bed together. You wouldn't think this would make a good film, but it does! At least I think so. It's a complicated movie, but still it doesn't require much thinking. (hm...) Most of the thinking cosists of trying to keep all the different characters apart.Personally, I think this is a basic case of we're-on-holiday-so-we-can-do-what-we-like and maybe it's not the best plot ever. Still, you can't help but enjoy it when Claudia's character dumps her arrogant, but good-looking, boyf. for Robert DJ's rather silly (but charming) character. Sends out a message that looks don't really matter. Any guy (or girl) who's ever wanted anyone outta their league probably feels the same way.So, in my opinion, a GREAT film... Sorry other people don't feel the same way.

It may not be iconic but it manages to make you chuckle throughout. I probably would have given this movie a miss had I not been reading Downey's biography. I just got curious to see the pre-Iron Man movies of Downey & I am not disappointed. The plot is simple. Friends decide to go skiing when one of their dads invites them over. In this journey they find their partners and mend their bonds. Finally all is well that ends well.Robert Downey Jr's role, although brief, keeps your eyes glued to him. This is probably one of his most sassiest yet cheesy performance. I guess the role required him to be that. His German accent is quiet funny. The highlight of the movie is when Downey reveals that he is from New Jersey & not Germany. That explains the fake accent I guess. I quiet fell for his funky hairdo. Worth a watch. You will enjoy it better with like minded friends.

It's a fluff piece. If you're locked up on a rainy day--or better yet, in a cabin during a winter snowstorm--with a couple of friends, some rum & a board game, it doesn't hurt to toss this on in the background, if for no other reason than to watch RDJ's fine derri√®re, easily the best part of this whole thing.Having said that, the one thing, if nothing else (and seriously, I'm not doing that much of a review here anyway...), that needs to be pointed out to the several people who have commented on RDJ's bad German accent--it's intentional. His accent is supposed to be cheesy like that because he's from New Jersey, not Germany. If that accent was supposed to be spoken by a genuine German character, bet your rear that Downey would have nailed it. It's a silly little bit of comedy that's not intended to be Shakespeare, and if you can just look at it that way, and try to enjoy the scenery, i.e. RDJ's man-tastic buns and the mountains, it's not a bad little flick, and it's mildly entertaining.

The characters don't seem to have any past but thanks to a talented product placement director, they do have very expensive cars and clothes. Tedious themes (son estranged from father, insensitive Lothario who can't find love) aren't helped any by a gay story line that suggests the writer has never met a gay person in his life. In an industry where producers have to struggle to piece together the funding for a film like The Opposite of Sex, its upsetting to see such a waste of human effort and money as Friends and Lovers.

I doubt if it was ever meant to be a block-buster movie, just a good, different perspective on the subject of Friends & Lovers.  I really think that the Jane character was played and developed very well for a controversial character.  Single, pregnant women aren't usually portrayed as normal people in movies.  Jane was completely normal, fun and had a personality that was likable.  Overall, a good, fun flick, just don't expect to find revealing life lessons within the plot. "},{"Title":"A wonderful movie!

But the film is full of ludicrous anatomy jokes and pointless nudity, and the aforementioned direction by Haas is sloppy and laughably inept.

I had a silly crush on him from OC & Stiggs, a terrible Altman film from 1985.  I ran across a full frontal nude shot of Barry on the Web and it mentioned Friends and Lovers as the source.  The image was so odd, Barry brazenly naked, except for a heavy winter coat and surrounded by snow and a Baldwin. This wasn't some sideways dark shot, grainy screen grab.  I'm talking 'Blueboy Hits the Slopes - Special Issue' quality shot. What the heck? He's not much to look at now, but I had to know how any American movie worked in such blatant full-frontal male nudity. Dear god, I have paid for my sins.  This was one of the worst pieces of thrash I've ever seen.  Long story short- There is a juvenile discussion of the characters penis that makes the girls all twitter. Then, continuing in the cheesy-teen flick vein (mind you, all these folks are in their 30's), The Baldwin tries to get the girls to strip for the Jacuzzi which leads to, 'Boys first! No Girls First!'  Then the boys concede and Barry drops his towel to show off his healthy endowment.  The girls all run away, supposedly never having seen a penis of any size before.  When The Baldwin complains, Barry gets to smirk and say, 'It was your idea, dude.' Gee, why did the screenwriter think it was necessary to ask an actor to do a full frontal shot?  Did they place an ad in Variety looking for well hung actors?  Did Barry have to 'measure up' at the screen-test? And I wonder if Barry was comfortable with such exposure as it was completely irrelevant to his character. Oh, wait!  Barry was the co-screenwriter on this crap!  So that means the writer/actor actually wrote in a scene where he gets to expose himself and show the world what a big wiener he has.  Lord knows that Hollywood is just a big tinkling contest but to actually write a scene for your own exhibitionist tendencies is too weird.
