Those funny one-liners (and there are plenty!) are much more than that they tell us volumes about the characters. This movie certainly does not spell anything out to the viewer (except, perhaps, the obvious), so you must be able to find the meaning behind the words.  If you listen to what the characters are saying, then you can understand their past relationships, their present feelings, which friends have stayed close, etc.  Remember, these are old friends the script is very realistic so the characters are not going to explain every line to one another.  I believe to truly enjoy this movie you need to pay close attention to all of the details and understand a bit about the attitudes and ideals of the two eras the movie depicts.Wonderful, intelligent movie!

Although I barely made the 60's, of which all the characters are reminiscing of and therefore perhaps I maybe missed some subtle messages or didn't get some in-jokes about the 60's, this movie still applies to everyone.  I guarantee every generation will have a time where they come back after 10 or 15 years and see friends that had been so important but are now barely on the radar.  They will have a weekend of drinking and tears and fights and laughter.  You will look at someone and remember a deep, hidden passion for them that you felt so long ago and never shared with anyone.That is of course, the plot of the movie.7 friends (who go wayyy back) one husband (who disappears pretty quickly) and a widowed girlfriend (who is barely known by anyone) come together after they learn that Alex, a friend formally part of the clique, had committed suicide (this part was infamously played by Kevin Costner).  They have a weekend of sex, drugs, and good ol' fashioned rock and roll, the whole time bringing up past ghosts that had seemed long forgotten and faded.  This is touchy subject, even in today's standards.  Yet the movie handles it beautifully.  My favourite section in the whole movie was when `You can't always get what you want' was played at his funeral.  Not for the song, although it is a classic but for how the characters react.  Each sit there in the church, some smiling quietly to themselves, while others have a sadden expression, remembering great times that were and never will be again.  Every person has a song like that, one that makes you remember your friends, one that makes you sad or laugh and  or grin to yourself as you remember the things you did. That to me clinches the movie.  It shows how true the script is, and how humanly the characters react.  There is a lot of angry hype about the movie, how there is too much talking and not enough sex or car chases or whatever people think is missing.  Yet for me, it is reality.  When something like this happens in real life, people do not over dramatise.  Life is not a soap opera, although movie-goers seemed to want this movie to be.  In a real-life situation, people would do exactly what the characters did, examine themselves and try to find a reason for the problems that have happened.  Yet the hard truth is, especially about suicide, sometimes, there is no one you can blame.  I think people didn't like this movie too much because it rang too true.  It was too realistic. People go the movies to be entertained, to fall in love with the fairy-tales lives that movies have.  This movie is honest.  It seems, for now, people just want to be na√Øve and live in a fantasy world.  If you want a true movie, see this one now.

These are the same people who once protested in the 1960s and were once against conformity and dreamed sweet ideals of they wanted in life. The Big Chill is a film that mourns the hippie era and it is also the beginnings and the rise of the yuppie era. The film tells the story of a group of college friends from the late sixties who are reunited at the funeral of a best friend named Alex (the role of the stiff was Kevin Costner until his scenes were taken out of the film) who committed suicide. The friends had all lost touch on and off in the years with the exception of Alex. They have all found their successes in life Sarah (played by Glenn Close) is a doctor and she once had an affair with Alex. Harold (Kevin Kline) is a businessman and married to Sarah and very secure with the direction his life took. Michael (Jeff Goldblum) is a journalist and investing on starting a nightclub. Sam (Tom Berenger) is a popular TV star in a Magnum PI-ish television show and has always been attracted to Karen (JoBeth Williams) who had once aspired to become a writer until she married a rich man and settled as a country club housewife. Then there is Nick (William Hurt) a former Vietnam vet who chose to become a drug dealer rather than pursue his doctorate in psychology. Meg (Mary Kay Place) is a successful lawyer who has decided that she wants to have a baby. And finally entering their circle is Alex's spaced out and naive-like girlfriend Chloe (Meg Tilly). All meet in the wake of his dead and they all spend the weekend together evaluating their lives and why their dear friend Alex died. We begin to know each of the characters through subtle scenes and dialogue without flashbacks or even any explanations. We begin to see why Alex died and it was not because he lost touch with his friends and because he was lonely, but because of the direction that his life took. It turns out that Alex was brilliant and was offered a fellowship to study as a physicists in a prestigious institution but chose to become a social worker. Each of his friends begin to questions the choices they had made and begin to wonder if they made the right choice. Excellent writing and terrific performances from the actors. Touching, funny, sad, and poignant film Lawrence Kasdan style.

No special effects, no car chases, no suspense, no anything that usaually passes for entertainment. Just excellent film making. Even tonight, I saw yet one more background detail I never noticed before. You have to watch this movie multiple times to appreciate it. Nearly everything that happens early in the movie relates to something that occurs later on. The transitions and foreshadowing, the character relationships, the very words themselves all fit together like no other film ever made. I truly believe that this is a film that should be studied as an example of pure movie making, no less than Citizen Kane. To rate this movie as a 10 is to underrate it.

When first released in 1983, I, like the characters, was in my early thirties, a former rebellious collegian from the '60s. After a decade in the work-a-day world, being a family man and raising babies, watching The Big Chill was like a fantastic time machine and took me back to places long forgotten. It really connected with me on a visceral level and I loved it. Now, almost twenty years later, I've watched The Big Chill again. Same effect? Not exactly, although a lot of this may be due to the effect of viewing any movie a second time. My views of the 60s are not so gilded as they were then either. The Big Chill is still a very good movie; you have to love it for the ensemble acting. So many of the actors in the movie went on to have respected careers in the 80s and 90s. It's one of those rare movies like American Graffiti and Diner that served as a launch pad for acting careers.  And the soundtrack is perfect, capturing the breadth of late '60s pop music. I really wish Kasdan had done with these characters, what Updike did with his Rabbit novels, that is, show the characters at ten year intervals through their lives. This is one of the better movies of this type and is highly recommended even for the gen-x'ers.

My generation's experience with this music is very different than that of my parents', having been force-fed Three Dog Night, The Band, and all the rest as a young child. It remains a part of my psyche, buried deep in the most obscure and remote of my memories. It was fantastic to hear those songs again, in spite of how much my taste in music has changed over the years. A classic is a classic, and the soundtrack is LOADED with them. Music can make or break a movie, and in The Big Chill, the music is an integral part of the film, as important as the cast, the writing and the directing. Its hard to imagine different music, just as it's hard to imagine a different cast. The songs weave in and out of the movie as easily and naturally as the subplots weave in and out of the story.22 years after being dragged to this movie by my parents (who LOVED it), I remain pleasantly surprised at what a good movie it is as a whole, and how much more I liked it as an adult. The acting is brilliant. The writing is excellent. The directing is fantastic. Everything snaps into place in ways that keep you from getting bored, irritated, or otherwise turned off. Sometimes melodramatic, sometimes hilarious, the characters are well-constructed by the writer(s) and beautifully brought to life by the cast. Two hours fly by without dragging, down time, misfires or backfires. The story unfolds in 1983 with a crew of Baby Boomers, college friends brought back together by tragedy, taking stock in their lives as they get reacquainted with each other after many years have passed. The story may be dated, but anyone, no matter their generation, can find something to relate to in this film. The interpersonal relationships, the individual journeys, and the self-reckoning that comes with the death of a friend... all of us can grasp these concepts and drink them in, get lost in them, feel the pain, and feel the joy. We can relate to it because its themes are timeless... love, loss, sadness, joy, growing up and getting older. This happens to us all.My only real criticism of this picture would be that once in a while the film was a little too poignant and too depressing for my tastes, but only for brief moments. It could be that no one else who sees this film will agree with me, or even notice. That's fine. Opinions...we all have them. For me, it went a little overboard, just a smidgen. This is the only reason I did not give this movie a 10. It is still a wonderful movie. Some might suggest that this going overboard was what made the movie effective. It was effective, very much so, but for me it was a bit too much from time to time. Once in a while, my heart strings need a rest.However, the music remains the most memorable part of the film. I had to look The Big Chill up on the internet to be reminded of the general story line, but the music has stayed with me all these years, and will remain with me, from the first notes of Joy to the World through the rest of the soundtrack and back. I would watch this movie again, and recommend it to anyone, no matter how cynical they are or what generation they belong to. Its that good.

A problem that can affect similar films is the unequal division of time that each character receives, but The Big Chill avoids this problem. It certainly is a moving cinematic experience that isn't easily forgotten. OK it doesn't really lead anywhere, but as it goes on, the nostalgic charm sets in and the core isn't hollow. Terrific performances from the ensemble cast who work well as a group. It's ironic how Kevin Costner had the most successful career yet if you blink you'll miss him. Some of the careers of the talented cast bloomed after this- Kevin Kline won an Oscar for A Fish Called Wanda, Glenn Close got 5 nominations (this film included) and got a status in Hollywood, Jeff Goldblum got success in the likes of Jurassic Park and Independence Day. Others didn't- Meg Tilly sort of disappeared, JoBeth Williams went on to flops such as Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot, Mary Kay Place had small parts in Girl Interupted and Being John Malkovich but went by un-noticed.The Big Chill is a complex and often brilliant story of the need for companionship. The soundtrack greatly adds to the nostalgic and uplifting feel to the movie. Great performances, splendid direction and an engaging script make this a deserved (if not slightly dated) classic.

Director Lawrence Kasdan hits the bullseye in this alternately hilarious and moving variation on the earlier RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN. This film follows the reunion of a group of friends who went to college together, who have gathered for the funeral of their mutual friend, Alex, who has committed suicide. The original screenplay included scenes with Alex, who was played by Kevin Costner, but, in a stroke of genius, it was decide to delete all of the Alex scenes in the film, lending a wonderful air of mystery to the character of Alex and allowing the audience more input as to why Alex decided to end his life. Alex's friends are Harold Cooper (Kevin Kline), who now owns a shoe store franchise and his doctor-wife, Sarah (Glenn Close), who also serve as our hosts ; Michael (Jeff Goldblum), a writer for PEOPLE magazine; Meg (Mary Kay Place)an attorney who wants to have a baby; Sam (Tom Berenger) an actor with his own TV show who misses the simple life; Karen (JoBeth Williams), a restless housewife who would really like to be a writer and Nick (William Hurt) a drug dealer who would like to be anything else. Also thrown into the mix is Chloe (Meg Tilly) Alex's girlfriend, who knows a completely different Alex than his friends do. This gathering of old and new friends sets the stage for some long-dormant resentments to bubble to the surface and for some long buried passions to be re-ignited. Kasdan has a sharp directorial eye and a flawless ear for dialogue with one of the most quotable screenplays ever and it is all set to a soundtrack of the greatest music from the 1960's ever compiled for a movie soundtrack. The cast is perfection...Close received a Best Supporting Actress nomination but the entire cast works at the same level and to honor one without honoring the ensemble wouldn't have been right. This is the ultimate ensemble piece and it works just about perfectly. Anyway you slice it, an instant classic.

(The actual anniversary had taken place in August 1979, not long before we went up). The joke was that those attending the reunion were all middle-class professional types, smartly dressed in lounge suits with well-trimmed short hair. This poster exemplified the way in which my generation saw the baby boomers, twentysomething hippies turned thirtysomething yuppies. Those who still retained their hippie idealism were mercilessly derided as being at least ten years behind the times. (And derided not only by Cambridge students but also by the likes of B. A. Robertson, in his satirical song Kool in the Kaftan). The Big Chill takes a rather more charitable look at the problems facing those idealists from the 1960s who tried to retain their idealism during the conservative Reagan years of the early 1980s. It features a group of old college friends from the University of Michigan who are reunited after fifteen years. The event which reunites them is the death of Alex, one of the group, who committed suicide while staying at the home of his friends Harold and Sarah. An impromptu reunion occurs as the old friends gather for Alex's funeral. The precise reasons why Alex killed himself are not spelled out- he did not leave a suicide note- but as the movie progresses we realise that he had become disillusioned with the course his life had taken. (He was a brilliant scientist, but had dropped out of the academic life to become a social worker). His friends also come to realise this, and the realisation prompts them to consider the paths their own lives have taken. Most of the group were involved in the counterculture of the 1960s and the peace movement or other forms of radical politics, but most are now living much more conservative, middle-class lifestyles. Harold is a business executive and his wife Sarah a doctor; they live in an elegant antebellum home in the South. Sam, a one-time radical, has now become a Hollywood actor closely based upon Tom Selleck, down to the moustache. (While watching the film I assumed that Selleck himself was playing the part; it was only when I saw the cast-list that I realised it was actually Tom Berenger). Karen is also now living an affluent lifestyle but is feeling dissatisfied with her husband Richard (who was not one of the college group). Michael, once a radical journalist, now works for the apolitical, celebrity-obsessed People Magazine. Nick, a Vietnam War veteran, has now become a drug dealer. Apart from their friend's suicide, the question which haunts the group is what became of their youthful idealism? Contrary to what one might have expected, the film does not take a straightforward radicalism good, conservatism bad line. A key scene comes when Nick nearly gets himself arrested by badmouthing the local policeman. Harold, a personal friend of the officer, manages to smooth things out, but then berates Nick for his rudeness and stupidity. To Nick, who still subscribes to the sixties idea that all cops are pigs , this may seem like a sellout to the enemy, but I suspect that most of the audience will side with Harold who realises that some of his contemporaries have difficulty in distinguishing between idealism and childishness. The Big Chill has something in common with another movie from the early eighties, Barry Levinson's Diner from 1981, which also deals with a reunion of a group of former classmates, although that film is a period piece set in 1959 and the characters are rather younger, being in their twenties rather than their thirties. What the two films have in common is that both are excellent examples of ensemble acting.This was the second film of its director Lawrence Kasdan (his first was the very different neo-noir thriller Body Heat) and it starred a number of actors, such as William Hurt and Kevin Kline, who were to become regulars in Kasdan's movies. , (Kevin Costner, originally cast as Alex, was edited out of the final version, but also went on to become a Kasdan regular). There are too may good performances to list them all, but special mentions must go to Kline as Harold, Glenn Close as Sarah and Meg Tilly as Alex's strange, unworldly younger girlfriend Chloe. One question much discussed on this board is whether the film is dated. Leaving aside trivial questions of fashion (even in the eighties Tom Berenger's hairstyle must have looked very seventies), I think that it is dated, but only in the narrow, limited sense that it deals with cultural phenomena such as the sixties counterculture which were very much of their own era. In a wider sense it is not dated because it deals with timeless issues such as love, friendship and the challenge of staying true to one's youthful ideals in later life. (Another eighties film on this theme, although in my view a less successful one, is Fred Schepisi's Plenty). I felt that the film was occasionally slow-moving, with too great an emphasis on talk over action. I also wondered whether it might not have been improved by keeping Costner's scenes to allow us to see what sort of a person Alex was and why his death had such a traumatic impact on his friends. Overall, however, I felt that it was a very watchable film, and often a moving one- one that could be watched for pleasure not only by those who are too young to remember the sixties but even those who are too young to remember the eighties. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Textbook Movie-making + Great Cast = Classic","Date":"18 February 2002","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  I had never thought much about how movies are made, what makes great movies, etc., until I took Intro to Cinema in college. Among the requirements of the class was writing a full-fledged movie review (read that as `term paper') on a film of our choice &#150; but one approved by the professor. I wound up reviewing The Big Chill, which was only about a year old at the time.A new student of cinema could hardly pick a better picture to study. Lawrence Kasdan puts on a film-making clinic in The Big Chill. What film better shows would-be film-makers the art of transition between scenes &#150; such as moving from the church organ's rendition of `You Can't Always Get What You Want' during the funeral, to the Stones' classic version, using it to bridge the funeral sequences with the reception at the Coopers' home &#150; and hence, with the rest of the movie. The roaring to life of the varied (mainly expensive) cars in the church parking lot also points out the affluence these former radicals possess. Kasdan mixes his incredible soundtrack masterfully with the action throughout the film. The camera's attention to the listener rather than the speaker in a conversation is also important. Kasdan's lens is always there to capture the surprise, hurt, anger or other emotions generated by another's unexpected remarks. Although this is early in his career, Kasdan clearly shows that he already has a master's grasp of his art.When I first saw it, of course, I was IN college. I viewed it a handful of times over the years, but had not seen it for half a dozen years or so, when I watched it a year or two ago. These old friends were getting together 14 or 15 years after graduation. While I had enjoyed the movie as a college-age viewer, I was amazed at the new wallop the film delivered, as I watched it 14 or 15 years after I had left college! There was an emotional impact I had never experienced in earlier viewings. Like these friends, I had assured my fraternity brothers and their girlfriends that we would always be close. Fifteen years later, I had seen ONE of my brothers a total of about three times. I sadly had to admit that it would probably take the funeral of one of US to bring our group back together.That said, the movie has some interesting twists and is somewhat unique for its LACK of action. I winced during one early post-college viewing, with a friend who had never seen it. After about 10 minutes, he moaned `Don't TELL me the whole film is going to be them sitting around a house all weekend, reminiscing!' I began whistling, looked the other way & pretended not to hear. Fortunately (unlike a recent poster), my friend was won over by the movie before it was over. The film has some wonderful moments and a few bizarre ones.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!One scene I still have mixed emotions about is the bizarre husband-sharing between Sarah Cooper (Glen Close) and Meg (Mary Kay Place). Depicting this as the ultimate act of friendship between two near-sisters and (I suppose) the ultimate act of trust between a husband and wife still seems a bit troubling to me. Still, it works, as do most of the plot twists. Perhaps the romance between the emasculated Nick (William Hurt) and Cloe (Meg Tilly) came on too fast, as some have suggested. I have always wanted to see a director's cut with Kevin Costner's cut-out role (I assume, all in flashbacks) as the dead Alex; I wonder if the cut footage might have made Nick's transition a little more readily acceptable.The film is one of dialogue and Kasdan and Barbara Benedek keep it snappy and believable. It is also quite witty. I saw Jeff Goldblum for the first time in this film and have been a big fan ever since. Some of his lines are classic, including the definition of the length of the average magazine article (which I won't give away here) and of nature being `one great big outdoor toilet.' Other lines are quite telling, like young Cloe's innocent remark (filmed by Nick), `I don't like to talk about my past as much as you people do,' and Karen's outsider husband Richard's crack `I can't believe these are the same people you've been telling me about, all these years!'I could go on and on &#150; heck, I HAVE gone on and on, but, in short, this is a masterfully done film. It doesn't have techno-crap galore; it doesn't have awesome backdrops (although the scenes in the edge of the woods are quite attractive); it has no blood, no visible sex, no explosions or dream sequences. What it has are real people, played marvelously by a talented cast, directed by a master, and featuring wonderful music. It still provides wonderful entertainment.

There is nothing waiting for us, there is nothing to look forward to, there is no hope for the days to come. This is an obituary for the generation past.The Big Chill is one of the greatest American movies ever made dealing with the concept of loss. I am you. I am all of you. A generation lost, a generation out of the tracks and into the unknown. You are what you choose in this life, not in some glorious afterlife, you are your hopes and dreams, your failures and successes, your mistakes and wrong doings, your past and your future, you are your friends.There is no doubt that the concept of modern western life runs through the looking glass of adulthood and friendship. These two ethical constructions define not only the individual, but also his surrounding environment, the juxtaposition of self and society, of creation or destruction within the normal boundaries of a capitalistic State. It is within these constructions that family is born. Nevertheless, the binding force of the entire human web is based on the only natural error that Man has never come to terms with death.The circle of friends portrayed in The Big Chill is long broken; a smell of forgotten innocence only remains to remind the group that once they were one. Not pieces of a puzzle, but the puzzle itself. Back in college they've learned to act as a fist, with strong bonds with one another; back in the American 60s, they learned that the dream of piece, love and understanding was not utopic, not unreachable, but just moments away&#x85; All of this now already faded away.In the prosperous America of the 80s lies another reality for them, the ultimate capitalistic dream, the life of the modern man encloses words such as family, money, kids, school, house, company, but not friendship. The ultimate hope of the once strongly connected group rests in the hands of the misfit, the one that never grew up, the one that probably stayed glued onto daydreams of the past and not conformities of the present, the boy that flew out of the window. And it is in this point exactly where Lawrence Kasdan begins his story, he heard a sound, probably we all did, and it was from the grapevine.The circle comes into closure, when one dies. After the funeral, a weekend is all that there is left for the eight friends to try and comprehend what went wrong. But in this very last stand of their own, they realize that what was missing was not something out there, but rather something within each and every one of them; old friends after all miss each other. With a light, romantic and earthly touch, Kasdan achieves his filmic purpose. You want to be a part of this, you want to reach out and feel the warmth, you don't want this to end&#x85;and it doesn't.

I was a child of the 60's, two years older than Kasdan, which of course places me where Kasdan remembers himself.When this film came out, it was part of the great exhale from the Reagan era, and a fond remembrance of when people were just better. It was easy to be smug when subsequent generations' touchstone movies were things like Porky's and America Pie. This film was an affirmation that we were okay, and was immensely popular. Part of the charm was recognition that these were Real Actors up there. On seeing it now with some distance, it is really shocking how unjustified that smugness was. Oh, the acting is still credible, and the music still resonates. But the writing seems more like a report by Time or even People Magazine on the era, something that itself is directly parodied in the script.In fact, the film in relationship to the real 60's has precisely the relationship to life parodied in the Sam Weber TeeVee show. We just needed some distance to see how contrived and simplified it all is, as if it were written by the Star Wars guy. But then, that's just what it was.That sweet spot that this film hit almost twenty years ago has melted and the film has faded into the wan oblivion of the rest of Kasdan's output.

It was the film which identified the 1960's baby boomer's as modern contemporary yuppies. Throughout the 1980's, yuppies were spotlighted in the media as the generational trend in post-Reagan era living. After the Big Chill people turned to Doonesbury and Thirtysomething to find out what the baby boomer's were up to. What once became a generation of free spirited hippies soon changed into a lifestyle revolved around corporate jobs, wearing suits and driving Volvo's. The Big Chill is a simple story that involves a group of old friends who reunite after hearing the news that Alex, a close friend has committed suicide. After the funeral, they spend a long weekend at the house of one of their friends, a married couple played by Kevin Kline and Glenn Close. They get together and spend time talking and trying to make sense of their lives by questioning the death of Alex and what's become of themselves. There is a sense of confusion about who they are and what they've become. I always feel like somebody wants something from me says a friend played by Tom Bergeron whose turned into a famous Hollywood actor. He feels guilty about his fame and the wealth that's earned him his paranoid suspicion's of other people. How could a group of friends like this go from tuning in an dropping out to living this corporate lifestyle? I hate to think it was all just...fashion. says a confused Glenn Close. Kevin Kline offers reassurance that they accomplished things. The 1960's did change a lot for the civil rights movement, the women's movement and protesting to help stop the war in Vietnam. What I always wanted to know, was Kevin Kline speaking on behalf his friends or his whole generation? Both of my parents who lived through the 1960's never became yuppies. I tried watching this film once with a close friend who was heavily involved in the drugs, protests and road trips of that period. After a half hour or so into the movie, he was incapable of watching anymore. He did'nt believe that these characters actually lived through the same things that he lived through. It sort of falls into this notion that if you grew up during the sixties and listened to the Beatles and had somewhat shaggy hair, you were instantly considered a hippie. It's a way for people to identify with something they had little or nothing to do with. The number of people who actually did experiment with drugs, sex and other aspects of life were really far few from the mass culture. This is why I feel suspicious of The Big Chill. How involved were these characters in the hippie movement? There is one character Nick, played by William Hurt who seems like the most believable character. He has a great performance as a bitter man who is tormented between the past and the present. He still has some of his naive and youthful instincts. He also seems like the most likable because he doesn't seem to hide any emotions like the rest of his friends. The other characters like the lawyer, the writer for People magazine and the movie star...how genuinely involved were they in the 1960's movement? We see these characters trying to relive the past by doing drugs and even sharing sexual partners. As my friend said It seems so phony. I don't know anyone who turned into this. A lot of baby boom audiences have responded bitterly about this film because it seems so personal and yet they cannot relate to the characters, and therefore they feel fooled, tricked or envious of these characters. The Big Chill does not speak for an entire generation and that is the problem. William Hurt may have been stuck in the past, but for crying out loud, he shouldn't be wearing a suit and driving a Porsche!

Alex was played by Kevin Costner but all that remains of his performance are shots of Alex in the coffin getting prepared for the funeral.I think it would have added to the film if there had been some flashbacks of Alex with them years ago.But other than that a great film that still works well after all these years.

The only form of consolation, a very significant one, actually, is the possibility to share this sense of disillusionment, and the understanding that the only way out of personal dramas is communing with others. Evidently, the actors, nowadays known as talented performers, but not so famous in 1983, are more than good.

This movie explores those ideas as seven college friends reunite for an unforgettable weekend.Seven friends who attended the University of Michigan in the sixties reunite for the funeral of their mutual friend, Alex (Kevin Costner, who was edited out of the film, and who only appears as body parts of the corpse). Alex has committed suicide while he and his girlfriend, Chloe (Meg Tilly) were staying with Harold (Kevin Kline) and Sarah (Glenn Close) Cooper. Harold is a successful businessman, and Sarah is a doctor. Coming in for the funeral are Sam Weber (Tom Berenger), a Hollywood actor; Michael Gold (Jeff Goldblum), a successful journalist; Nick Carlton (William Hurt), a drifter; Meg Jones, a Philadelphia DA; and Karen Bowen (JoBeth Williams), an unhappily married housewife. Once together for this sad event, the seven of them decide to spend the weekend together for an impromptu reunion. During the course of the weekend each of them confronts what has happened to their hopes, dreams, and idealism, where are today, and where they want to go. By the end, each has found something of their former selves to take with them as they go their separate ways.This is an interesting premise, and it's well executed here. You see where each person is proud of what he or she has accomplished, but also reminded by the presence of the others of what he or she dreamed of accomplishing. The gap between the two is what drives the film, and makes the self exploration real, as each person in turn opens up to their closest friends. In the end, they seem to realize that perhaps their best accomplishment has simply been their connection to each other.The acting is wonderful. The cast worked as an ensemble, so the level of acting among the performers is uniformly good. It is clear that the actors all respected and valued each other. As a result, the chemistry between them is real, and the relationships created are believable.I was a senior in college when I saw this, and at the time I wondered if I would worry about where I had been and where I was going as I aged. In the twenty-two years since graduation, I can only answer that yes, I have asked those questions, and explored those issues with those to whom I was close at the time. That's why I think this film has a certain timelessness, because it really does speak to everybody who has ever serious contemplated their life direction. And it's well worth taking the time to contemplate it along with those who do so in this film.

I disagree with previous comments in that I thought that was the point that Kasdan was trying to make.  In this opinion, I may be 180 degrees off, in which case the detractors are correct.I enjoyed this film in a theater and on television.  I liked the snappy patter.  I thought there was a plot, albeit a slow-moving one without much action.For me, the plot revolves around Nick William Hurt.  This cynic is another disappointed naif who has largely checked out of a world that has disappointed him.  He is the member of the ensemble most bent on demystifying the idealism of the others and the Sixties.  Nick's cushiest berth speech is priceless, for example, in unmasking the misty, watercolor memories of the poseurs.Each of the other characters may be read as a representative of different strategies for coping with the death of youthful dreams, beliefs, or illusions.  Harold Kevin Kline is every bit as skeptical about their youth as Nick but has his manufacturing to keep him warm and busy in the present. Sarah Glenn Close is a professional who is apparently happiest in her domestic role, no matter what she might have planned in Ann Arbor. Michael Jeff Golblum is, in my view, the member who has changed least from a hedonistic, sardonic observer divorced from most of what is going on around him.  Berenger, Williams, and Place confront their changes in dialogue, so I shall not belabor them here.Perhaps most interesting is Chloe Meg Tilly.  I see Chloe as a latter-day hippie.  She exhibits stereotypic features and sentiments of self-absorbed, live-for-today boomers even though she is not one.  She alarms some of the ensemble despite the way in which she mirrors the selves that they are all nattering about.  This would be a better story, I believe, and my interpretation of the movie would persuade me more if at least one of the characters acknowledged how much Meg resembles the hippies whom those of us old enough to have know hippies knew.In my view, then, the cynical Nick is verbally worn down by the delusionals and won over by the realist Chloe.  At film's end, the delusional chorus are leaving Nick in the arms of the post-boomer hippie. One dark side of the 1960s drug trafficking yields to one bright idea of the 1960s attempted realism in the form of the one person in the ensemble who doesn't like to dwell in the past.It ain't Goethe, I'll grant you, but it ain't garbage either.

Sometimes you look at a film and wish you could walk out of the audience and in to the on-screen world, but I don't really want to here.*Smallest possible spoiler*Someone is dead (a before-famous Kevin Costner actually - but you wouldn't know it from the outline shots!) but does anybody really care (on screen or off)? Suicide seems to be the reason, but don't come looking for definitive answers as to why. He left no note.I was expecting some dazzling revelation to this puzzle as the grand climax - but we don't get it as the movie only wants explore the hippy chattering classes' dream that has turned bad (although only in the punishment-of-luxury version of bad) using the dead, and soon to be buried, Alex as a throw-people-together device. Curious in the casual use of drugs and even more curious in the mention of a character having taken cocaine - something we never actually saw. While this may have been a cutting room decision we are (from 1983) at the point where drug taking is seen as the norm? There are no voices against and I wouldn't want to list the drug users (soft or hard) from the non drug users. It is a non issue says this film.The more you reverse engineer this product the more you realise why some of it is false. Bring any group together and you create families - if only for a small period of time Mum, dad, kids and uncle figures. People work together here (watch the table being cleared by team work), but they are not equals and their hippy-dippy sharing-and-caring days are clearly over.Tom Berringer even has his own TV series that seems to embarrass him. Why? Because it is a kind of cod Magnum Private Eye programme that shows him leaping in to sports cars and bedding women? Do you think he didn't beg for the role, celebrate after he was given it, use it to seduce women? And let us not forget the money. I always try and put something of value in to every episode he says at one point. So he writes the scripts as well does he? Pure nonsense. Ironically the film's greatest strengths are that it doesn't have a climax and it doesn't really have a point. Nothing is solved, not even Alex's death, and their world has been reduced to well paying jobs and pseudo-intellectual jaw-jaw over the kitchen table.They are secretly miserable people, leading secretly miserable lives from which the only respite is dope, sex and jerky dancing to soul greats.

The script still seems fresh today, almost 30-years later and this is the first time I've experienced it. It helps most of the fantastic humor comes from Jeff Goldblum, whom I've always adored and found hilarious.

Again, this is not to say the remaining cast wasn't great and they did their jobs accordingly.So, we have these old friends together again, following a very bad incident and let's watch them learn, explore, communicate, attempt to work things out and learn from this.

Thanks to Lawrence Kasdan's strong script and fine direction, the superb performances of all cast members, and the beautiful cinematography, I find that it hasn't lost its power to move an audience. Sure, Kevin Kline's less-than-convincing Palmetto State accent sounds rather silly at times, but other than that, what's not to like about this film? The film has held up well; I find suggestions that it is dated to be untrue and irrelevant, as the film quite accurately reflects the mood and state of our society at the time that it was made. As such, it is a rather beautiful portrait and/or elegant portrayal of life in America in the early 1980s.On the other hand, comparisons with The Return of the Secaucus 7 are probably inevitable for anyone who has seen both of these gems. For me, The Return of the Secaucus 7 is vastly superior in every way originality, authenticity, humor, and ability to move. As much as I admire Kasdan's entire body of work, John Sayles is the true master of American cinema. The so-called star power of The Big Chill and the slickness of the production pale in comparison with the rawness and reality that is The Return of the Secaucus 7.Notwithstanding the claims to the contrary, I find it hard to believe that The Big Chill was written without any knowledge of The Return of the Secaucus 7, its premise, and its plot. As such, The Big Chill is something less than a remake - I won't use the word plagiarism - but there are just too many similarities to allow for sheer coincidence. While this does not necessarily diminish its ability to entertain, it does affect any claim that it is a landmark. It is not.

I haven't seen it, I didn't even know it existed, so I won't go any further. All I want to do is add a comment on one of the best 80s movies.I often ask myself Which is the essential 60s, 70s, etc. movie?, and by saying essential, I mean which movie best captures the spirit of its times. I have come to the following conclusion Easy rider (1969)is the essential 60s movie, The exorcist (1973) is the one for the 70s, and this one represents in an excellent way the 80s. One could claim, that the beginning of a decade doesn't necessarily deal with the same questions that the end of it does. That is true, but I think that the only decade, that actually fits this claim, is the 60s. The 70s were much a decade of decadence, loss of faith and disappointment. The 80s were a decade of show-biz. The point was to look happy, even if you weren't. That's the point of The Big Chill.Essentially starting from this point, the movie has a lot more to say. What we are experiencing, is the true decadence of the flower-generation. They don't have a purpose in their lives, they have lost their faith and are truly scared of the present and the future. Much of it also goes through the 70s; but there's a crucial difference In the 80s you must look happy. All of them try to show that everything's cool, yet they know that they're fooling themselves. The shadow of their deceased friend -who would be 'played', as a corpse, by K. Costner- is everywhere.Many critics hold this movie as the most mature of its decade. I wouldn't go so far, but I know it's a film with a point The love-generation is dead and gone forever. Four years later, Wall Street will complete the puzzle The Yappies are here.

I was 21 and (maybe) too young to understand the problems these people were dealing with but the excellent acting (especially by Close), great direction, sharp script and wonderful soundtrack kept me entertained. However people who came of age in the late 1960s seemed to really understand this movie and it became a surprise hit. Over the years people have acted like it's some landmark of cinema. Well sorry folks but it isn't! It's VERY good and entertaining but that's all it is. The script is full of great one-liners...but nobody really talks that way. Also some of the situations are way too pat and predictable with obvious (and trite) happy endings all around. Yeah I DO love it but only because it's an excellent comedy-drama. It's worth seeing but don't expect some masterpiece.Also Kevin Costner was originally in the movie. His character is the one who commits suicide. However all of his scenes were cut out.

The Big Chill refers to the chill that director Kasden had through his bones when running into an old college friend who had different values than him, and Kasden felt a Big Chill running through his body realizing that this person whom he knew as a college kid had a far different outlook. In the scene where Richard is sharing his personal views with two of the baby boomer characters, played by William Hurt and Tom Berenger, Hurt gets a look a lot like there's a chill running through him. But then after Richard says No one ever said it would be fun. At least... no one ever said it to me, both boomers get a look like Perhaps he's right, and indeed he is. This movie is a classic, because it not only embraces the baby boomers and their side, but it lets them realize that their youth was in fact... youth, and when its time to grow up, life isn't as easy and/or simplistic as when you are young. Jeff Goldblum is my personal favorite character, providing some of the best lines since he is a true outsider of the group; as is William Hurt's character, a drug dealer who still hasn't grown up. In one scene he mentions that perhaps all of them never knew each other at all being that they were so spoiled as children. The entire cast is fabulous. The weakest link is Mary Kay Place's story about wanting to get impregnated; it sort of drifts in and out of soap opera qualities, but no matter...

Some time after seeing this, I saw Return of the Secaucus 7 which probably inspired it--the director of The Big Chill, Lawrence Kasdan used to deny ever hearing of Secaucus 7, and later just denied seeing it. Unconvincing, because it was a movie that played for months at some theaters and helped usher in the 80s/90s wave of indie film. John Sayles made it for $20K, employing actor friends and using a plot that brought together college classmates, most of whom had gone on in the way normal ways that people often did in their first 10-15 years after college and even poked fun at their old political idealism. It even had a subplot involving a penis, like Big Chill. Despite cheap production values, I saw why people had loved it--Secaucus 7 captured change and provided a natural setting of friendships gone deep and frayed. As for Big Chill, it's easy to see why many critics and members of the public never liked it. It's basically a high concept version of Secaucus 7--better production values, middling known actors and overly dramatic, cynical shifts in people's lives. The acting seems flat and the characters don't really seem to engage each other. At least we were spared Kevin Costner trying to act--I always though he should have stuck to corpses. The best parts were William Hurt who probably was playing himself--not literally, but he has the best lines and delivery and carries off the most twisted, if somewhat unbelievable back story.

At the subsequent funeral, Harold and Sarah reconnect with their friends from University of Michigan, including Sam (Tom Berenger), a successful actor, Nick (William Hurt), a Vietnam War veteran, Karen (JoBeth Williams), the dissatisfied and frustrated wife to Richard (Don Galloway), Meg (Mary Kay Place), a real estate attorney, Michael (Jeff Goldblum), a womanizing jokester, and Chloe (Meg Tilly), Alex's girlfriend.Following Alex's burial, Harold, much to Sarah's dismay, invites everyone over to their lakehouse for the weekend, where friendships rekindle and old memories are revisited, as the gaggle of formerly close friends decide to recount past experiences and elaborate on current ones in the face of tragedy. The film shows that certain calamity does indeed bring people together, and Alex's death has allowed for a bunch of old chums to address their friendship, and, inevitably, their relationship with Alex, in addition to seeing how they could've prevented Alex's suicide.The Big Chill is a film that winds up swooning people into thinking it's a fairly deep examination of grief and death, in addition to a cultural exploration, when it's really a film that suffers from its own glibness. The film has a lot of great music, which - in its organizations seems more like a 1970's era playlist - sometimes takes prominence over the film's characters. Being that there's little in the way of plot progression, the bulk of the film is left up to the characters, whom do an middling job at keeping the film going for the first half, at least.The problem with The Big Chill is the real film doesn't start until the last forty minutes. The real animosity and drama doesn't begin until all the small-talk is out of the way, and while that's maybe commonplace for these kinds of situations, it makes for a film with stifling inertness. During the first hour, the only remotely interesting character is Michael, thanks to his hilarious insights (It's unfair that they throw you a great party when they know you're not going to be there, he states during Alex's funeral) and his wit, while the remainder come off as narcissistic brats with little offer.The music in The Big Chill is uniformly strong, recreating that nostalgic vibe of the 1960's and rekindling that spark of youthful idealism and the inspiration of hope and change. It also works to help the audience remind themselves of the time period in which these characters grew up, with hits from Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Temptations, and Aretha Franklin, all of whom adding to the feel of the 1960's encapsulated in a film set years after the decade of revolutionary change in America. The problem is that, with this assortment of terrific tracks and their placement in the film, The Big Chill feels like a mixtape or a playlist, inevitably spawning keen memories but doing little in the way of being substantial or memorable in a long-term sense.The remaining forty minutes, however, challenges screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan (who also serves as director) and Barbara Benedek, in addition to the characters they have penned for this film. The final act of the film allows for true emotions to bleed through, and the soundtrack to finally take a backseat to some real emotional honesty, in a film that has ostensibly been delaying it with recognizable golden oldies and chuckle-inducing dialog. The focus on pathos becomes much darker, and the eventual sympathy and sorrow for Alex's untimely death is finally questioned in a way that forces all the characters to be interrogated in some way.While The Big Chill develops into a more watchable film during its last forty minutes than it was in the preceding sixty, it's ultimately still a film too focused on glib revelations and momentarily insightful instances. It's the kind of film that, during its time and its era, it was seen as an intelligent and fascinating social critique, whereas in the present day, it's nothing more than a potential-filled drama that is nowhere near as relevant or as impacting as it was in its heyday (along with other films like Easy Rider).Starring Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly, JoBeth Williams.

Memories are shared, old wounds are reopened, and, of course, old flames have sex. And that's it. There's no climax or resolution. It doesn't end, it just stops.Performances are varied. Kline and Close are wonderful as the adults in the room, people who are too busy living their lives to have existential crises. William Hurt is fun as a smart-assed screwup; he may not know where his life is going, but unlike the others he has a sense of humor about it. The rest of the cast struggles, however JoBeth Williams and Mary Kay Place are given paper-thin characters as Middle-aged Women With Romantic Troubles, and Jeff Goldblum (as the group brain) and Tom Berenger (as an aging actor) fall back on their stock characters of Spazzy Nerd and Wooden Tough Guy, respectively. Meg Tilly, as Alex's much younger girlfriend, seems like a little kid at the grownups' table - although, to be fair, maybe that's the point.We never really know these people.

Every generation needs a movie it can call its own, a movie that reminds them of a time when they were young and the world was no bigger than the sum of their own problems. But for such a movie to really succeed, it has to reach beyond that generation, to have the same resonance for each new generation that sees it. The Big Chill fails that test.

I would be more intrigued if they chose obscure songs from the time or even psychedelic instrumental music from the 60's.It's like if you did a movie about people who went to college in the 80's and the soundtrack was Duran Duran, Madonna, and Michael Jackson. Big Deal. I never understood why people compliment soundtracks that are just some mega-hits playing in the background to fit the era depicted in a film.Why did they all go to University of Michigan? Only one character now lives in Michigan. Some were raised in the South, and others generic. Where did William Hurt's character drive in from in an old Porsche? I've seen this film several times and I did not see Kevin Costner in any coffin. It must have been a quick shot. But I'm pretty sure he is way too young to have gone to college in the 60's.Congratulations to the writers and director for putting in some defense of conservatism. Two different characters explain the virtues of the conservative life and point out the childish self-indulgent nature underlying the 60's mentality.Why did Hurt's character go to Vietnam if they were all radicals? Did he get drafted? He had a Masters Degree. He would have been in college for the whole war. No one even mentions his army service, either to thank him or condemn him for it.Other than hearing about it in passing, there is no indication that Hurt and Williams' characters had been a couple in school. I saw little if any affection between them.I loved the scenery. I guess it was South Carolina or some such place.I don't like to see multiple adulteries depicted. But it was not necessarily condoning the acts, but rather saying that this is what those kinds of characters might do.When we watch a film, we need to remember that the film makers are not necessarily endorsing the actions of the characters they create. They are just making them do things that fit their personalities. It wouldn't be much of a movie if no one did anything wrong.I think the two conservative characters balanced the message of this film. Which is that the way to change the world is to take responsibility for yourself, your family, and your community. That doesn't entail simply protesting stuff or denouncing things. It consists of hard work, dedication,delayed gratification, and loyalty.Good dialogue overall, but they could have implemented a few deeper passages, like in the movie Network. Hence my title. It was like it wasn't sure if it wanted to be a lighthearted reunion picture, or make some deep statement about life. I think it was ultimately the first, with a little of the second.

The characters here compare their sixties ideals with the harsh reality of their lives in the eighties and think about how much simpler life was at one point when they all felt they had the world at their feet. Becoming a grown up in a radically changing world, full of rebellion and optimism only to wake up years later and find that their impact on everything doesn't amount to much.Each character in The Big Chill is representative of how they cope with that reality. They all come together when one of them has committed suicide and they spend a weekend remembering past times and discuss the present. The suicide victim, who's obviously the most extreme example, is a man who couldn't find his way in the cold hard world, where your opinions and ideals don't add up to a hill of beans and you find out that you're most likely not going to accomplish anything of what you dreamed you would. Some people in The Big Chill have adapted to these new times quite nicely while others haven't.When I watch The Big Chill I sometimes wish I had grown up in these times, when the world was a little more innocent and naive and blind idealism ruled. Growing up in the 90's I feel the best of times had already passed. But really that's just one way of thinking that the grass is always greener on the other side, perhaps in years to come another film like The Big Chill will depict the reality of the 90's and show how the world has changed since then and then I'll feel all nostalgic. The Big Chill shows me that you don't have to be a product of the sixties to fully enjoy the film and get the point the film is making. That's a rare thing in a film, it's quite universal in it's message and it becomes a trip down memory lane no matter when you grew up; you find similarities in many things here.The Big Chill has it all; great story, great actors, great music; it's just a great movie.

No matter who the victim, or how the survivors may be related to him and to each other, suicides are tragedies. Pure and simple. It seems that Alex's friends snap too easily out of their grief and into a horny, hazy nostalgia punctuated by a Motown soundtrack that provides rimshots to scenes where zippy one-liners didn't come easily.Nonetheless, well-chosen ensemble casts always have an appeal for me, and in this one I particularly enjoy Jeff Goldblum and Mary Kay Place.

They are leading very different lives from the ones they had hoped for. They speculate that this is the reason for their friend Alex's death. He was the brightest of them all, yet never seemed to achieve as much as they have because he never bought in to the system, as the film conveys.The thing I like best about The Big Chill is how each character has his or her own story to tell. They all have different careers, marital statuses, income levels (all but one are wealthy), and philosophies on life. However, they share one main commonality life has turned out much differently than they had imagined, as it ultimately did for Alex.This film is one college students and graduates should see.

It is difficult for me pinpoint the precise reason for my attraction. At fifteen, the gloomy plot undoubtedly appealed to my teenage miseries, but now ten years later, I feel something more than that. An old man once told me that a day would come when I would stop caring so much about the world. His comment left me distraught because I fear the day of becoming something that I loathe. Yet, at the same time, I know that I can not avoid certain realities. This movie recognizes that fear and gently admonishes it. The Big Chill honestly portrays the fears and guilt's of its characters, without condemning them for their faults. The movie opens up with that Rolling Stones song, You Can't Always Get What You Want, and this song sets the theme throughout the rest of the movie.

For a long time, it remained the film I would list as my all-time favorite.While I still am a big fan of the film, having recently purchased the DVD and seeing it for the first time in quite some time, I did find a hint of dated psychobabble, enough for me to drop it a notch to a 9 from a 10. But what the film did so well was inhabit a certain generational psyche and mindset and it did it with finesse.What makes The Big Chill so special is the way it captures a particular group of friends who have an evolutional moment in their lives when one of their college friends passes on. It's a film about re-discovering ones own lives and roots and moving on.Those who lived close enough to the generation in the movie to have understood what the characters represent, appreciate the insightfulness and message of the film. And the incredible soundtrack remains one of the best uses of music in movies ever.It was this film that turned me on to a whole slew of superb actors. Kline, Hurt, Close, Place and crew exude great chemistry. The entire experience was exhilirating at first viewing and remains so to this day for me. It's a personal film and tends to make one examine their own lives and relationships.Sure, there is a bit of dated material in it, but it still is vastly superior to much of the current wave of self-indulgent swill that uses similar ensemble conventions.Interestingly, I can somewhat understand someone who did not live in this time being bored with it.

I had heard, many times, that this movie was a modern classic that dealt with the existential crisis of growing older and facing the ephemerality of one's youthful dreams. Furthermore, the topic, suicide and its effect upon a close circuit of college friends, did seem intriguing. But it did not hit the mark, in fact, I feel the movie grossly missed its intended message and sunk into equivocality and ambivalence.What do I mean? For example, it becomes very apparent that everyone is touched and hurt by the suicide of their friend, however, why must they turn to marijuana, sex, infidelity and some highly questionable decision making like Mary Kay Place's search for a possible father to aid her in conceiving a child without a father? Now I am not some strict moralist and I am not saying that the world should conform to the loftiest of ideals, but I do feel as though we have a meandering script, a story without a message, merely a half-hearted continuation of an ethos that died hard at the close of the 1960's, i.e. free love and the recreational usage of drugs. We never see this successful and supposedly adult characters candidly address their pain, disillusionment, sorrow. What we see is them revert back to old college idealism and easy answers to pressing and disheartening questions. The script seems to suggest that while life is not easy, it is okay to use drugs and sex to depart from life's problems for awhile, no harm done. I disagree, but then again I am also far more cynical at my age than these characters evidently were when they were in college in the 1960s.My one compliment of this movie is its excellent music, however I don't think it was artistically crafted to aid and serenade the montage.

Most of the people that I grew with during this time are now firmly entrenched in the establishment that as youths they abhorred with all the passion they could muster. It's called growing up, and finding your way to justifying where and who you are.The characters are all products of successful families, who usually ended up being the ones that questioned authority the most anyway. That they themselves are now successful, only leads them to search for what was so important to them in their youth.

The 8 characters in this film are extremely well-developed and all have equal and individual importance to the group as a whole.  The story is about 8 friends who went to the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor during the late 60's.   All came from affluent families (this is told by Hurt's character in the film, and helps to explain as to why all of the friends have such successful, yet emotionally unfullfilling careers).  They are reunited years later for the funeral of Alexplayed by Kevin Costner, but his acting scenes were deleted), who was considered the best out of the group, but ended his own life in despair.   Sarah (Close) and Harold (Kline) Cooper; now a doctor and businessman respectively, house their friends for the weekend following the funeral. It is this weekend where all of the friends discover how much they need one another and start to mourn their lost ideals from youth.   Meg (Place) is now an attorney; Sam (Berenger) is now a popular TV actor (kind of a  Tom Selleck as Magnum P.I.); Karen (Williams) is now an upper-class mother and housewife catering to her cold husband Richard (Galloway); Nick (Hurt) is a former radio psychologist  now involved in transporting illegal narcotics and following in Alex's footsteps;  and Michael (Goldblum) is now a writer for People Magazine.  Chloe (Tilly) is the younger character who was Alex's last girlfriend and serves to represent the tangible being of what was Alex. The other characters see in her not only the youth that they mourn and remember from college (naiveness, a carefree lifestyle, flexability, etc) but also one of Alex's last attempts at feeling young again (he was much older than her). The musical score is superb and correlates with the drama of each scene perfectly. The opening sequence where each character is learning of Alex's death and traveling to the funeral to the tune of I Heard It Through the Grapevine is not only outstanding , but also ingenious in thatit provides the audience a small glimpse into each character's settings in which they all believed they were emotionally happy.  The most famous scene from the film is most likely where the characters dance to Ain't To Proud to Beg while cleaning the kitchen after dinner.  The symbolism is outstanding in this movie. There are so many levels of symbolism that I cannot even begin to count them all.  The cast is superb, all of the actors deserve equal praise.

They were hippies who thought their voice could change the world, but now all of them are either rich or settled into a sort of comfortable suburbia. Kevin Kline and Glenn Close are a married couple who invite their buddies to stay the weekend after the funeral. They are about to sell their chain of stores to a corporation, becoming quite wealthy in the process. Tom Berenger is a television action star. William Hurt is a dope-head who suffered an unfortunate injury in Nam and is similar in ways to the friend who committed suicide. Mary Kay Place is a lawyer who has had little success in her sex life and simply wants a child. Jeff Goldblum is a writer for People Magazine. JoBeth Williams is an unhappy suburban housewife still in love with Berenger. Meg Tilly was the younger girlfriend of the suicide victim who remains in the house they were starting to renovate. These characters will spend time together, reminiscing, dwelling on the past, enjoying each other's company, while at the same time discussing adamantly the mistakes and disappointments which have occurred in their lives. Not exactly a real plot to speak of, more or less THE BIG CHILL works off it's awesome cast of incredible 80s talents assembled, the tone often a mixture of laughs and melancholy. It is sad that it took one of their own killing himself in order to bring these people back together, and the film follows them as they come to terms with the loss and their own futures. Developments include the revelation that Close had an affair with the suicide victim, Berenger and Williams' growing closer as the weekend continues, Kline given permission by Close to assist Place in her desire to be a mother, Hurt's interesting relationship with Tilly, etc. The soundtrack is incredible and speaks for the cast's generation, along with a screenplay that has a great deal to say. While I do prefer THE RETURN OF THE SECAUCUS SEVEN, written by John Sayles, THE BIG CHILL is a movie I find irresistible because the cast appeals to me, and there's a watchability to it, in that I can return to it and never tire of it. I do believe some might consider this movie a bit ponderous and too relaxed, but I think that's part of why it continues to endure. The use of a camcorder derives some funny moments such as Hurt's chat with himself(along with Goldblum's antics, cerebral discussions with both Close and Berenger)and Tilly's airheaded nature(her sexiness is used to effect as well)is utilized to the hilt. The courtship of Berenger and Williams, and Close's deep, close friendship with Place, are given a great deal of screen time. I personally think Hurt steals the film, but the entire cast(also in abundance are the Goldblumisms)shine, each member given an opportunity to strut their stuff. There are times when conversations get a bit heated, particularly when the suicide victim is brought up, but we see how long-term friendship is lasting even during times of hurt and grieving.

Brought together for the funeral of suicide victim Alex, eight friends gather for a weekend of remembering and reliving the times when they were all students - Alex being the most promising of them all - and wondering what drove their little hero to kill himself. Each of the friends, through self produced play with a video camera. Through intimate conversations, and through the psychology of group 'therapy' explains where they are now in comparison to where they thought they would be. The only member of the group who is 'new' is Chloe (Meg Tilly) who had been Alex's girlfriend. The group - Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, and Jobeth Williams interact philosophically, over food making in the kitchen of the Close/Kline home, share frustrations and fulfill expectations in both friendship and physical interactions. Surrounding this film is a selection of popular songs from their time that extend into the memories of the viewers. It is a funny film. a tender film, a tour de force of acting by some very fine actors, and a memory trip that is wroth repeating with some frequency, like opening the old photo album.

The characters in this film seem like they were mostly privileged kids who attended a university and dabbled in some of the trends of the era. Being big Michigan football fans doesn't fall into what would be a hippy way to spend time. They listen to more R&B type tunes as opposed to the Jefferson Airplane,Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin (to name a few). They may have felt they were part of the movement by having a sit in at the Ann Arbor cafeteria for better vegetarian lunch options. There isn't enough background given to decide if they are hippies or not. I'm sure there were plenty of people smoking grass who weren't hippies. This is a great movie that really makes you think about your life whether you grew up in the 60's or the 90's. There is a common thread that can be identified with no matter what your age.

They are brought together again by the tragic death of one of their friends, a member of this group that we never get to know because he is dead as soon as the film starts. They all stay together in the same house for the weekend and talk and talk about life, death, love, etc. They listen to old records. After the weekend is over, they go home. Big deal. The main problem I have with this movie is that there is nothing really going on. It's not really about anything. So, therefore I can't bring myself to feel much sympathy for these people, or even begin to like them or care one way or the other what happens to them because I don't feel like I get to know them. They all have this history with each other which we know nothing of and don't get to know much of. It was a real letdown. So be warned If you didn't like Sideways or Reality Bites, you will not like this movie. It is the Sideways and the Reality Bites of the 80's.

Being emotionally and socioeconomically distanced from the subject matter, the film's flaws are glaring and verging on insulting, if it wasn't for the film's sheer naivete. While the cast is otherwise impressive, and Lawrence Kasdan has produced some work of note (penning Empire Strikes Back and Raiders of the Lost Ark), the film's premise is one of Yuppie self-infatuation. The film's characters lament a lost youth of idealized rebelliousness, while never drawing to attention to the fact that they have become the very epitome of what they once railed against - the establishment (and mastheads at that). Their woes are excruciatingly superficial - it's as if real problems don't exist. It's the 80s at its worst - displaying cheap sentimentality, manipulatingly conveyed through a conspicuously consumable soundtrack, no doubt one of the most successful soundtrack albums ever, found in the record collections of every baby boomer. It's interesting to note that Lawrence Kasdan tried to replicate the success of this film with Grand Canyon which was an even greater mess, incorporating another staple of the boomer generation - New Age Philosophy.

He sets up the most obvious of gags, complete with character cut-outs, and yet he does manage a laugh or two--but it's purely on the good will brought about by the actors. The writing does not exist on any plane of reality, the changes in tone are jarring, the dialogue is frequently juvenile and/or embarrassing. Just as William Hurt is about to explain his sexual dysfunction to Mary Kay Place, we get a 'funny' jump cut to another room where the other characters react to Place's high-pitched scream, but--ha, ha--she's just reacting to a bat which has flown into the room. That's a good one. Or how about when Meg Tilly tells the story of her deceased boyfriend who didn't eat meat because he was afraid he'd be reincarnated as a steak. This is the kind of nudge-wink material Kasdan can't seem to get passed. Some of the players--Jeff Goldblum, Glenn Close and Kevin Kline, in particular--do rise above the occasion. Meg Tilly is much like a friendly, stoned bunny rabbit, but hers is an insulting role. William Hurt is made to be sullen and combative, and yet this character would not have shown up for the party. Mary Kay Place has another insulting role (she's just there to get pregnant!), and I have no idea what JoBeth Williams or Tom Berenger were trying for.

That being said, this movie is really dated, and if it was other people acting in it would fail completely. Having lived in Ann Arbor for five years on the campus of the University of Michigan, I can honestly say that the director truly did capture the smug self importance of university of Michigan alumni. This he got down perfectly, as well as the narcissism and ego of the baby-boomer generation, who hypocritically dove head first into greed and money after sowing revolutionary oats in the sixties.But most of all, this film seems to be about the confusion and despair those of that generation were during the early years of the , capitalist 80's. The characters reconnecting after one of their college friends killed himself because he felt he was a failure, speaks volumes for the self induced pressures placed on those of that time. Real or imaginary, failure didn't seem to be an option.Tom Berrenger as the movie star character of J.T. Lancer, a take off of T.J. Hooker of course, seems the most out of place amongst this group of friends, he doesn't seem like a Michigan graduate, way too good looking and far less cerebral. Jeff Goldblum would be perfect, he would have been a student and graduate from Michigan, intelligent, smug, self important, selfish.The woman who wants a baby, the character played by Mary Kaye Place, she claims she just wants someone to Plant the seed but when Jeff Goldblum offers she says something sarcastic about how it wasn't romantic, if she truly just wanted someone to plant the seed and nothing more romance shouldn't be a consideration. This of course is just one flaw in the film. Overall, at the time this came out, and for people of a certain generation I'm sure this was an important film, but now in this day and age it is way less relevant, as many wish they had the luxury of choosing to reject capitalism, most are struggling to get by during this time of the great reset.

The dialog is very real, what would actually be said in that situation. I did not think the movie seemed very scripted. There are some LOL moments, some misty eye moments, some poignant moments, etc... I think anyone who is 30+ has the same questions as the characters in this movie. As a bonus, it simply has the best soundtrack I have ever heard. The songs fit the mood of the movie in general, and the specific scenes perfectly. They are not just songs for the sake of songs. Anytime I hear one of the songs from this film I immediately think Big Chill. Even 22 years after I first saw it, there are some scenes which just resonate so clearly with me. I like the fact the flashback scenes were cut out, I think it is best Alex is left faceless and you still get to know a bit about him. It is also a very well made movie. It fits together like a puzzle. Clues in part A make sense when you get to part B. Overall a great film with a tremendous cast. It is a movie you have to listen and pay attention to in order to get something from it. If all you like is Die Hard type movies, you will not get it.

All the actors are 50 to 55 now, which means they were about 30 to 35 then, and their reunion was triggered by a death of one of their friends, played by Kevin Costner, whose flashback parts were all cut, and all we see of him are clips of a mortician dressing his body in the opening scene.So, the premise of the story is a very simple one, this group of 7 old classmates plus their dead friend's girlfriend (Meg Tilley) spend a weekend in close proximity, and lots of things, good and bad, come out. The dialog and acting are superb, and Kasden was fortunate to have so many actors who have continued to become big stars. Jeff Goldbloom is a geek, obviously makes plays for each woman, even Kline's wife (Glen Close), and strikes out each time. A side story is Mary Kay Place's desire to get pregnant, and finally Close volunteers her husband, Kline, and was well-done as a testament to how strong her trust was of him. William Hurt's character is bitter, partly because his wound in Viet Nam made him impotent, but in the end Tilley latches onto him for who he is, and they stick around to work on the old house of Costner's together.Overall a landmark film, a great set of character studies and done in a very believable manner.

I can see what attracted them to this script, the ensemble writing is evenly doled out, the American angst is well proportioned and clearly expressed. For me it is entirely dated and is fading fast. What appeared so neat and chick in 1983 now looks too self conscious and although well intentioned, limp like a wet noodle. I kept thinking of other films that had family and friend dynamics that really left an impression. Think of Ordinary People, of Terms of Endearment and if you really want to have your eyebrows scorched, the white hot interpersonal relationship between Jack Nicholson and his estranged family when he returns home for a visit in Ironweed.The Big Chill does exactly that it cools out each and every single opportunity for these characters to catch fire and spit out some sparks. Why Kasdan, who both wrote and directed this movie, opted to smooth out all possibility of real drama is not clear to me. The film could have exploded along many different lines of friction. Instead all possible avenues of heat were subsumed by the relentless pit stops into self-examination, terminal long staring into the camera as the person thinks about something and then cut into the next scene without any closure. We get a drama that had all the makings of a volcanic eruption but the earth barely shook. It was all cooled out into a feel good retrospective of a generation that was unable to mourn for a lost friend and unable to emote past an adolescent level. No one was willing to give 100% and really hurt anyone and if pain was visible it was hugged away, kissed away and finally banished with too many you know I love you answers. Really, I thought who talks this way? In real life, conflicts do not go so smoothly, almost ever. So, what was Kasdan offering us? A vision of bright people who were unable to take any meaningful risks at reaching each other at the core of the heart, too afraid to commit themselves lest they cause some discomfort along the way. The script ended up, for me at least, in portraying these fine actors as shallow and that is a shame. They can all act very well and the story could have been much darker. From where I sit in 2006 this film looks sad, dated and despite great music, half of what it could have been. If this film had been released today I suspect people would laugh, unable to see themselves in the exchanges that pass as communication. I was quite disappointed.

Tom Berenger, Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, Mary Kay Place, JoBeth Williams, and Meg Tilly all star, and this movie certainly affirmed that they were to be the next generation of great American actors and actresses, even if some of them didn't do too much afterwards (Kevin Costner of course played the deceased friend, even though his scenes were left on the editing room floor).

Unfortunately, its writing and conception are Hollywood conceits, shallow and silly.

The story is simply terrible. Dark depressing drivel. This reminds me of some of Hemingway's later work. He was hailed as a great author. And then he shot himself. And people realized that he was not great he was depressed. This movie is another of those situations. If you like movies that are intentionally depressing and morbid, this is for you. I, on the other hand, am just waiting to find out that the principle creator of this film has shot him/herself. Or committed suicide in some other way. We can only hope that the people who were involved in this hunk of worthless garbage have not made any more movies.

Had Kasdan kept these three or four minutes and left the plot and dialog on the cutting-room floor, he could have spliced together a handful of entertaining beer commercials that would have contributed far, far more to our culture than The Big Chill. In and of itself, The Big Chill isn't that bad. It's just a silly soap opera that might deceive you into thinking it's High Art because of the A-list cast and pretensions to seriousness. It's very calming to watch, thanks to its shadowy lighting and Kasdan's preference for soft colors. No actor is particularly outstanding, but no one embarrasses himself. Special kudos must be awarded Oscar nominee Glenn Close, who, as adulterous wife Sarah, is able to deliver Harlequin Romance lines like there was a secret place in me that only Alex could touch as if a human being could actually say them. But what makes The Big Chill vile is its ideology.Has any movie done more damage to this country? On a superficial level, we had to endure thirtysomething and pathetic reunion tours by every washed-up 60's band on Earth. There's also the sad fact that movies like The Big Chill convinced a few addle-headed members of my demographic group (I was born in 1967) to try to create some kind of generational identity. (It was doomed to fail there weren't that many of us, we didn't face an existential threat on the level of the Vietnam War and the self-appointed voice of our generation was Douglas Coupland, who couldn't write.) On a more permanent, damning level, it's possible that The Big Chill helped cement the myth of American decline. Please note, none of the aging hippies in this film were the slightest bit disappointed in or dissatisfied with themselves. No, they were angry at the world that didn't live up to their ideals. Particularly nauseating is Mary Kay Place, a crusading public defender who lost interest in her job when she found out she'd have to represent actual criminals. A close second is smug creep Kevin Kline, who dismisses all music released after, say, 1971 as garbage and rationalizes his materialism with a single throwaway line. The ultimate message of The Big Chill is that the world is going to hell, so you might as well make yourself a nice cup of herbal tea, toke up a number and nestle in your nice, big suburban house. Which this country's entire upper class has done while three genocides have raged and the children of the working class have fought and died in two wars.But there is one saving grace to The Big Chill the filmmakers had the wisdom to cut Kevin Costner out of the movie. Imagine Kevin Costner and William Hurt in the same scene . . . it's a termite's wet dream.

So begins the implausible plot line of this film by director Larence Kasden. Kasden started his directorial career with a nice tribute to film noir movie in Body Heat but then for some reason felt that every movie he would make from then on would be a large ensemble cast feature like Silverado, Wyatt Earp, The Accidental Tourist, I Love You To Death and Mumford. It reminds me of those old Mickey Rooney movies when Mickey says, Hey gang, let's put on a show! I'm surprised with Kasden's love for big casts that he never put out a musical. The Big Chill stars Tom Berenger, Glen Close, Jeff Goldbloom, William Hurt, Kevin Kline, Mary Kay Place, Meg Tilly, Jo Beth Williams and a few others in this yuppie yawner. Lawrence Kasden and Barbara Benedek were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Screenplay for this film as was Glen Close for Best Supporting Actress. Incredibly the film was also nominated for Best Picture. It didn't win any awards which spared the audience of having the entire cast come on stage to accept. This movie has some good moments and a good cast of ascending stars and a good soundtrack of 60's tunes but it goes nowhere, the characters accomplish nothing and you don't really care about the characters after spending a couple of hours with them. Alex was the only one to kill himself but perhaps a mass suicide would have worked better and spared us from this self-absorbed inspiration to the TV show 30 Something.

This movie more than others depends on the viewer. When I saw it in 1983, as someone who had graduated from college in 1977, so nine years younger than the characters, and feeling that my generation had always been ferociously overshadowed by those college graduates whom Time Magazine had put on its cover that year, I was resentful at the hogging of the spotlight, the relentless introspection, the self-indulgence (with sex, with drugs, with grandiosity) of that generation. Most of the characters seemed so relentlessly concerned with whether they were happy, whether they were fulfilling themselves - and so little with whether others around them were. Their refusal to accept life as it came - whether it was the absence of a child, a role in a popular but superficial television series, a stable if unstimulating marriage and family, the death of a lover, was distressing. Instead, they seemed to me to leap the bonds of morality -the lover taking another within two days of his death, marital infidelity, flagrant disregard of every narcotics law (and utter contempt for police) - all were justified so they could reach for happiness. I was disgusted by these people.I also personally didn't like the music - my favorites of that period weren't Motown but the equally popular and much harder music of Mountain, T. Rex, Cream, Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Faces, The Kinks, Deep Purple, Yes, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Delaney and Bonnie, Traffic - in fact, looking back, I blame this movie now for being partially responsible for the elevation of Motown to status of being considered as THE music of the late 1960s - where in fact it was merely one of the contenders at the time. Seeing the movie again, I think the characters are very well-drawn - they seem like very real people. Jeff Goldblum's character is very funny, everyone's performances wonderful, and the pace and evolution are very well-done. I think the ending is too tidy - e.g., SOMEONE  would be outraged at Meg Tilly so easily falling in with William Hurt, and Hurt's sudden decision to stay put is not credible - we haven't seen his evolution.The movie is too smug about Don Galloway's conservative middle class character - it's as if he's beneath the others' efforts to sympathize. He's NOT part of the clique and apparently the writer feels that this justifies sympathy for JoBeth Williams' decision to be unfaithful. I LIKED the Galloway character and disliked the other characters for their exclusion of him. Similarly, if the dead Alex were SO remarkable, could he really have found a relationship with the empty-headed Meg Tilly character? Perhaps - but we don't learn what appealed. She's certainly not charming, warm, attractive, witty. One does wonder if she is supposed to represent a clueless younger generation - but that's probably unfair to the writer - she's just a character not a symbol.There is something unattractive about former radicals somehow seeing that period of their lives as somehow more genuine, more true - the truth is that if that period were more true of themselves, they'd grow even more like that as they grew older. It's a sort of nostalgia for the sandbox.All in all, I'd recommend  the movie - there have been imitators since (e.g., the awful Peter's Friends, St. Elmo's Fire, and many others) that aren't as good. I haven't seen The Return of the Secaucus Seven - to which the movie is compared unfavorably, but I wonder if I'd like it as much as seeing William Hurt or Glenn Close, Kevin Kline or Jo Beth Williams - and perhaps most Tom Berenger as a very sweet, slightly dim and very humble man.

Besides the obvious funeral, the scenes that stick for me are the dancing around the table, and because there is no original music, some great songs have been put in, such as Aretha Franklin's (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, The Beach Boys' Wouldn't It Be Nice, The Temptations' Ain't Too Proud To Beg (which was number 94 on 100 Years, 100 Songs) and Marvin Gaye's I Heard It Through The Grapevine. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Screenplay. Very good! "}]
