[{"Title":"Superior Rendering of the Hugo Classic","Date":"25 April 2001","Score":"20 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":"  	Carried on the winds of fate, injustice often settles upon the poor and downtrodden, whose only link to salvation may lie in the truth they carry in their hearts and the manifested courage of their convictions.  And sometimes that quest for justice and truth must be mounted against all odds, as in this 1995 version of `Les Miserables,' written for the screen and directed by Claude Lelouch.  An imaginative retelling of the Hugo classic, Lelouch updates the story to the Twentieth Century, beginning with the stroke of midnight that ushers in the New Era.  It's an inauspicious beginning of a new year for Henri Fortin (Jean-Paul Belmondo), however, as he becomes a victim of circumstance and is convicted of a crime he did not commit.  As he goes off to prison, he leaves behind a wife and a young son (also named Henri), who must fend for themselves as best they can.  It leads to a miserable existence for all concerned, but steels the young Henri for what is yet to come, and he quickly learns that when things seemingly cannot get any worse, they not only can, but do.	Ultimately, this becomes the story of the young Henri, whom we next encounter at the end of World War I.  Now a boxer, he is soon to become a contender.  By 1931, however (when we next meet him), that part of his life is behind him as well, and he has become a furniture mover; and with his own truck, he is able to at least make a passable living.  But at this point, we are introduced to Andre Ziman (Michel Boujenah) who has just met the soon-to-be Mme Ziman (Alessandra Martines), who by the beginning of the Second World War are destined, along with their young daughter, Salome (Salome), to become an integral part of Henri's (also played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) life.  	Henri, like his father, is illiterate; and when circumstances bring him together with the Ziman's, he is inadvertently introduced to Hugo's novel, and soon begins to realize how his own life parallels that of, initially, Cosette, and later-- and most significantly-- Jean Valjean.  When they end up taking a journey together, Henri implores Ziman to read the story to him as they travel.  And it's as if in the words of Hugo and the life of Jean Valjean, Henri discovers within himself all that is good and worthwhile.	Lelouch has crafted and delivered a poignant version of the familiar tale of injustice and perseverance that borders on the profound.  By interspersing scenes of the Hugo story as they are being read to Henri (in which Belmondo is Jean Valjean), we see the parallels being drawn even as they become clear to Henri.  The film is fraught with irony and succinctly captures the essence of Hugo's novel; it's as if Lelouch had been possessed of Hugo's spirit when he wrote the screenplay, as well as later when he brought his vision to fruition, the finished product of which has to rank among the best interpretations of the story ever.  	The supporting cast includes Annie Girardot (Farmer's Wife), Philippe Leotard (Farmer), Clementine Celarie (Mme Fortin), Philippe Khorsand (Javert), Nicole Croisille (Thenardiere), Rufus (Thenardier), William Leymergie (Toureiffel) and Micheline Presle (Mother Superior).  An emotionally engaging, riveting drama that will sweep you up and carry you away, `Les Miserables' is a tale of dignity and courage, and of what it takes to overcome betrayal and injustice.  But even more than that, it's a study of morality; of right against wrong and of good that in the end must triumph over evil.  A superior cinematic rendering of the classic story, this film-- especially for those to who love the novel-- is not to be missed.  I rate this one 10/10.

Entertaining, haunting and enchanting film which intertwines the Victor Hugo novel with twentieth century events. The complexities of the human condition (which French filmakers tend to excel in over their American counterparts) are explored. Human emotions and logic struggle for control in every situation, and this beautiful story delves deep. It's an old struggle, true...yet rarely done so well.The protagonist (Jean Paul Belmondo was born to play this role)Henri Fortin, struggles from his impoverished childhood to his adulthood where the struggle for criminality and nobleness compete heavily. His story and that of Valjean from the novel compliment and collide. The people and the situations he encounters, all involve themselves in a montage of life and experiences.LES MISERABLES is a unique, beautiful and complex story about a simple man. It unflinchingly exposes the good and evil that can arise from the human soul, in the worst of circumstances.

It would be highly advantageous to have a good grasp of the characters and plot/line of Hugo's Les Miserables in advance of watching the film in order to fully appreciate the universality and agelessness of the human situations which are re-encountered in this particular World War II setting. Both Hugo's novel and the film fully empathize with our universal human experience, and what are still the central concerns of our lives pleasure & pain, the love and hate present in our relationships, and at the most fundamental level, simple survival. It can leave the viewer personally identifying one moment with Jean-Valjean, and yet in the next with Fantine or Cosette, and inevitably (disturbingly), with Javert.

Perhaps not directly, but if one has the ability to read between the lines you will notice that this movie IS Les Miserables. Each character in this movie is symbolic of a character from the book and each occurrence in the movie has some relevance or mention in the novel. For example, there is a scene where the two men are trying to escape prison by swimming out and they try to see how long they can hold their breath. In the novel, Jean Valjean (the prisoner) jumps off a boat and swims to his freedom, but he must (obviously) hold his breath long enough to swim away without being noticed/having to go to the surface for air.This movie is excellent, dramatic, moving, and intriguing--never a boring moment.

A few were tried and executed after the war for their role, but in fact tens of thousands of Jews were happily sent off to the concentration camps by people seeking favor with their Nazi occupiers and perhaps inherently anti-semitic anyhow, as the Dreyfus affair had long since attested. But there were decent people, too, and astoundingly 500,000 Jews in France survived, protected by nuns, priests, ordinary people of integrity and decency who refused to be animals just because they had lost their freedom. This movie tells the story of some of these people of each persuasion, as they interact in different ways with the forces around them. One of them, himself the son of a wrongly convicted man and the woman who sold herself to keep her son alive, sees himself through the pen of Victor Hugo and, in living up to his conception of Jean Valjean, transcends all the ugliness about him.

The dates of these cover 101 years, from 1909 to 2010! But the original title of this remarkable 1995 version is Les Misérables du vingtième siècle(the miserable ones of the twentieth century.) The film title credits read Les Miserables of Victor Hugo but then adds freely adapted by Claude Lelouch. Lelouch was also the director and producer.I saw the film on television in the 43 format. I would have preferred letterbox so I could have enlarged it to fit in my wide screen plasma TV, but the film is in French and the subtitles in letterbox format would have been hard for people viewing it on older sets to read. (I found the subtitles to be very easy to read.) But I don't think much was lost by trimming the edges of the original film. The main characters in the film are Henri Fortin (Jean-Paul Belmondo), the father and his son by the same name, who earns the nickname of Jean Valjean (Victor Hugo's protagonist) because of events in his life that correspond to those of Hugo's Valjean. When the novel is read to Henri Fortin to help him understand why the nickname, the story telling dissolves into an enactment of the novel. In those sequences we see Fortin playing the part of Valjean.I had a little difficulty following the start of the movie, which opens with a wretchedly sad Henri Fortin as Jean Valjean regretting something he did and calling after the little chimney sweep. (I am not familiar with that part of Hugo's novel. We learn later on what Valjean regretted.) It then switches to a major ball being held in France to celebrate New Year's Day at the onset of the 20th century. This leads up to Henri Fortin the father being falsely accused of murder. This section of the film deals with Henri senior's life as a convict, his wife's and young son's lives during that time, and his escape attempt.Things advance from there to his son, now grown and a prize fighter, at the end of World War I. The film then moves forward about 20 years and an older Henri junior is now a retired French champion driving a moving van as German rule begins to sweep Europe near the start of World War II (a couple of years before Pearl Harbor caused the US to enter that war.) I think that the more you know of the Victor Hugo book the more you will like this film, but I think that even without any knowledge of the original you will still get a lot out of watching it.From then on there is no dull moment as the protagonists move through lives of anguish and deceptions.Although the film is full of tragedy, it leaves you filling good at the end.

When I heard that this film was being played at a local Art Theatre, I eagerly gathered my family to go see it. I was horrified at first, because the entire movie was in French with English subtitles. No where was to be heard the incredible lush musicals I had seen in the play. You see, I knew nothing of the story, other than getting the chance to see it in a live performance. So I had tricked my family into going to see what we all thought was going to be a musical.Foreign films with subtitles are the worst kind of torture to my family and the few friends I dragged with us. However, as the story unfolded, I could see not one of my family (scattered around the theatre) got up to leave. At the conclusion, we were all extremely moved, and I realized the incredible nature of this story by Victor Hugo. I have since seen other versions of this timeless story, but I have to say, this one is the most moving and my favorite.It was so incredible to see the cross stories, of the WWII present and the Victor Hugo past. The present day characters could see themselves in the plot in the book. All the characters made me long for their safety and survival and I was moved beyond words to be part of their lives (both the present day characters and the past characters). Sometimes it was frustrating to get caught up in one story line and then switch to the other story line. But soon, you were caught up again in that change in time and place and you didn't want to switch to the other story line. Every one of my teenage children came up to me at the conclusion and thanked me for making them see something they would never have chosen for themselves.

In short, the good and evil of mankind.One can immediately appreciate writer/director Claude Lelouch's passion and sincere admiration for Hugo's story, as he lovingly relates to us the story of Henri Fontin, a man whose miserable beginnings yet big heart parallel those of the famed Jean Valjean.Lead actor Jean-Paul Belmondo is thoroughly enjoyable as the generous spirited Fontin, also playing on occasion the heroic Jean Valjean in flashback. Strong support comes from Michel Boujenah and Alessandra Martines as a fugitive Jewish couple who turn to Fontin for help. Lelouch's daughter Salome plays the couples' tragic child who is left in a Catholic orphanage to hide her true identity. Clementine Celarie is moving in her brief role as Fontin's mother, and playing Javert is a convincing Philippe Khorsand. All this intense acting and Lelouch's passionate direction ensure a most involving, highly rewarding film.Cinematography is often inspired (again Claude Lelouch), capturing rural France. Art direction from Jacques Bufnoir is solid, and music comes from Francis Lai, Erik Berchot, Didier Barbelivien, Michel Legrand and Phillipe Servain. Helene de Luze provides the editing.Monday, March 24, 1997 - Hoyts CroydonClaude Lelouch lovingly tells this war time variation on Victor Hugo's novel. Purists and fans of the musical may not get a great deal from this translation, but lovers of quality, epic cinema will.All credit must go to Lelouch for the way he nurtures this film, delivering excellence in all areas throughout the entire running time. Acting performances range from solid to riveting, and the entire technical crew astound also. The music came from several sources.By far the best French film I have ever seen.Monday, November 27, 1997 - Video "},{"Title":"A genuine, unqualified masterpiece telling an old story in a new and extraordinary way","Date":"8 February 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, History","Review":" The received wisdom is that the rate at which film masterpieces are made has slowed to a virtual standstill. But this film, a relatively recent work (1995) by the great French director Claude Lelouch, contradicts that. It is a brilliant reworking of Hugo's classic tale, set against the turmoil of occupied France and manages to be both epic and intimate. It is one of the most moving and powerful films of the past 50 years and yet at the same time it manages to be charming, uplifting and even funny at times. Arguably, it is also a film that only a Frenchman could have made because it is so brutally honest about the conduct of so many 'ordinary' French people under the Vichy government. The performances are heartbreakingly good, Belmondo has never been better and he is surrounded by a remarkable cast. Not least of these is the young Salome Lelouch (Claude's daughter) - effortless in her role as the 11-y-old separated from her parents as Hitler's stormtroopers sweep across France. I commend this film to everyone, it occupies vaguely similar territory to that of Schindler's List but is incomparably better - more real, curiously more human, more engaging, less artful. Breathtaking.

It can sometimes be misleading for people who have not read the book and are looking for a way around the hefty 1000 + pages... I can just imagine some high school student trying to write an essay after slouching through the semester without doing the reading assingment and renting this version. Lelouch's nods to Hugo are varried and playful - he even includes allusions to the chapter on street language (argot). He gives character to the normally colorless Cosette and he and Belmondo manage to communicate the sweet, un-educated simplicity of Valjean/*Fortin in scenes like the one in which he rides a truck across France and asks passengers to read the book to him and explain passages for him. Great stuff, but for enhanced pleasure, read the book or at least see one straight version before this one.

Brilliant characterizations and acting.Opening the movie is one of the most moving ballet solos I have ever seen. It was absolutely spell-binding. What a fabulous way for two leading characters to meet. Worth seeing the movie just for that.Recalls the brilliant dancing of Gregory Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov in White Nights. Different of course but another fabulous movie dance moment (W.N. was not such a fabulous movie but still very watchable). And if you love dance and haven't seen H & B dancing together, well then...

A savage lion COULD put its killer instincts on hold and sit still as a wimp removes a thorn from its foot and a few years later, in the arena, that same lion COULD recognize the wimp who helped him and refuse to eat him. Call me vulnerable but I buy this. Same thing with this movie. Four people - mother, father, daughter, plus lorry driver who-is-helping-this-Jewish-family-escape-to-Switzerland-in-WW11 COULD get separated and survive ENDLESS hardships and meet up again after the war, and the Father COULD be the lawyer who defends the lorry-driver and saves him from the guillotine, and the lorry driver COULD be an illiterate who gets it into his head that he is the human incarnation of a fictional character (Jean Valjean)and that his life will follow the same pattern and he COULD become mayor of the town. Why not, it's a free country. Lelouch, of course, does chocolate-box and does it in spades, so this is always going to be easy on the eye. He also directs actors well and chooses actors who can deliver - any movie that boasts Micheline Presle AND Annie Girardot can't be all bad - and so he does here. The only way to watch this is to surrender rather than suspend your disbelief and then you will be rewarded.

Some worth mentioning would be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche, and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert.
