Excellent.","Date":"7 May 1999","Score":"112 out of 122 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  How much is $70,000 worth to you? I'm sure that right now 70 grand would come in real handy. But is it worth numerous beatings, getting shot, being run over and having your toes mashed by a hammer? It is to Porter.I'm sure you're aware of the plot to this film (vengence, old flames and mucho violence) but that barely scratches the surface of this brilliant little noir. Whilst the story is basic the nuts and bolts used to make it are complex, twisting and not quite what you expect. For a start there are the characters. No good guys. Not one. Porter is a criminal. He's not even a particularly nice one. He's a killer, a thief, a thug, a gambler, a cheater, a liar and I bet he doesn't even pay his taxes. Likewise everybody else. Sadists, murderers, corrupt cops, drug dealers, gang members, mobsters, hookers. They're all here in their various shades of bad.The success of this film relies on two people Gibson and screenwriter/director Brian Helgeland. With the lead gleefully playing against his nice guy image Porter is as nasty as they come but still retains such charm and Gibsons trademark grin that not for one moment do you dislike him. He's cool in a way that Bruce Willis' Jackal never was. He quietly slipped across continents with hi-tech equipment in various guises waiting for his moment. Porter just walks into the hoods house with nothing but a revolver and asks for his money back. A lot of the comments I've read say that Porter is mean. He isn't. He'll just do what it takes to get his money back. He has nothing to loose so why not do it anyway. Porter is who Riggs would be if he'd never met Murtaugh. Out of control, against massive odds but just crazy enough not to give a damn.Helgeland shows real talent as a director in his first time outing. As a scriptwriter he's always been in the upper classes with a talent for mixing unrepentant violence with uneasy humour. Here he shows he can tell a damn good story along with writing it. Nothing happens the way it's supposed to. We're used to good guys threatening to kill but always really bluffing. Porter isn't. He'll ask for what he wants, he doesn't get it, BANG, you're dead. People die at the wrong time too. Characters that are supposed to last until the end die in the middle while minors that only just arrive survive only to get whacked by the finish anyway. The motivation is all wrong as well. 70,000 is chump change to these people. The mobsters are wearing suits worth more than that. But Porter wants that and nothing more. He spends most of the film correcting people who think he's after more.While based on the same source material as Point Blank, Payback is nothing like it stylistically. The first used understated violence. Payback goes for the jugular and rips it out with copious amounts of rheseus negative. It's hard to see this film working without this combo of star and director. If you had, say Sylvester Stallone or Nicolas Cage and Richard Donner or Joel Schumacher in charge you'd just have a bunch of nasty people doing nasty things with none of the ghoulishly comic touches that make Porter cool. Be thankful it's the combination it is and then go and see it. If you like thrillers you'll love this.

If Gibson's character has any redeeming qualities, they are on a very short list.  Porter (Gibson) is violent, at times even cruel and the other characters aren't much better; some are worse.  Every character is from the wrong side of the tracks, even the cops are on the take and there are no punches pulled.  The only character you can really feel is a good guy is Rose, the stereotypical Callgirl with a heart of gold (although it's maybe only 10 karat, not a real 24 karat heart).Nevertheless, you will root for Porter.  Frankly, I don't think anyone else could have pulled off this role and still kept the support of the audience like Gibson did, but then he generally always plays the good guy with a twist.  This time, the twist is a little more savage than usual.All in all, if you enjoy the occasional violent romp on the big screen and you're a fan of Mel Gibson; Payback is worth seeing.

If you are open to great storytelling and gritty dialogue, this is the movie for you. In some ways superior to the remake and just as gripping. Some have hated this film just because of what it was, and that's a shame for them that they can't enjoy a film that neither glorifies nor trashes the underside of life. In a weird way, the main character Porter (who was Walker in the Lee Marvin film, played this time by Mel Gibson who is almost as good as Lee Marvin. Nobody could be better than Marvin in this kind of role) has a kind of decency code of his own even though it is more than a bit twisted. After all, in a world inhabited by criminals, the rules change significantly and so once has to either adapt or find a way out. Porter does both in both versions.No sense in rehashing the plot. Suffice it to say that it is about a crook who got burned and wants what is coming to him and gets even along the way. Besides, the plot has been recounted by so many better reviewers than myself. I can only say that in Point Blank the ending is a bit more ambiguous. A precursor to the films of the 1970s.It's always hard for me to rate one film version over another. It is almost impossible to not want to (in my mind at least) mix and match actors in roles. James Coburn played the same part as did Carroll O'Connor in the original and they are both perfect while being so different. After all, they were both accomplished actors. And maybe I could have done without a lot of the S&M and B&D scenes in the newer version but I chalk that up to the changes in the world since the 1960s.Long before there was a Quentin Tarrantino, there were great directors like Don Siegel, Sam Peckinpah and Sam Fuller who were as tough as nails and not just some fan who knew how to use the best of all of these guys brilliant touches, and add some sick jokes. But director/writer Brain Helgeland does spectacularly well with the material, while the new cast shines in their roles almost as though they weren't acting, but living the parts. And that goes right down to the underrated David Paymer as a pathetic hustler (who could easily have been played in earlier times by an Elisha Cook Jr. as he did with the Wilmer role from The Maltese Falcon yet Paymer does so with more humor.) It is hard to make one root for people so lacking in morals but director, writer and actors manage amazingly well.Both Payback and Point Blank are instant classics that should be considered as such. And God bless the memories of Lee Marvin and John Vernon (both in the original Point Blank version.) Such fine thespians will be sorely missed. Fortunately, their memories are on celluloid and other mediums to be enjoyed by many more audiences.You might have guessed I really love these two movies.

Donald E. Westlake, who has written the novel on which the film is based, has picked up the thread of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett to create an authentic universe with real characters, and Brian Helgeland has succeeded to bring this universe to the screen.Everything about this movie is great - the storyboard, the cast, the direction and the soundtrack.

Henry does a stirling job here opposite Gibson. Liu is simply wonderful in a role that - worryingly perhaps - looks like it was made for her! Porter's single-minded, no-nonsense determination to get what he sees as justice for himself strikes a chord, and has you rooting for him right to the end. This film rarely lets up on the intensity, and gets better as it goes along. It will make you laugh and cringe at the same time, but you won't want to take your eyes off the screen for a second. It looks good, feels good, and oozes class. Definitely a must-see.

But there is a very good reason for that. Both films are based on the novel 'The Hunter' by Richard Stark, a pseudonym for Donald E Westlake.The films share several character names such as Brewster, Carter, Stegman and Fairfax and similar plots. In both cases the anti-hero Porter (or Walker) is trying to recover a sum of money after being double-crossed.Now, I am a huge fan of Point Blank. It takes a relatively simple plot and makes a bit of cinematic poetry out of it. And if I was forced to compare Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson's performances, then I'm sorry but Gibson would lose big time. However, Payback is a much better film than I thought it would be. There are sufficient differences to make the story interesting and though it is told in a much more straightforward and, dare I say, 'safe' way than Point Blank, it is a very well made film and tells a compelling story well. And it's nice to see Gibson return to a somewhat morally ambiguous character a la Mad Max.

Rough characters, rough violence and rough language all comprise this re-make of the 1967 film Point Blank, which starred Lee Marvin.Mel Gibson is the good guy here, taking Marvin's role, but I put that in quotes because he's not really good, just a thief attempting to get his $70,000 back which was stolen from him by his partner and ex-wife in a former heist. He goes up the ladder, little guy to the top boss, to finally get his money.Gibson gets beaten up several times and even gets tortured in one toes- crunching scene. The women are tough-looking, coarse and unappealing. I did like the metallic-blue hues in here, making this an interesting visual film. However, the city scenes are bleak, a la Batman.Despite the above, I still found the movie good enough to watch several times. Most people like a simple, revenge story which this really is, and there is dark humor in here, too. The other characters are interesting, particularly the one played by William Devane. I also liked the narration by Gibson, done in 1940s film noir style. The worst person in here was the sadistic Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). He was so bad, he was cartoon-ish, someone so bad he belonged in one of those Batman or Hellboy or Spiderman flicks.

It's a simple play on perspective not often utilized in the movies. Usually, the hero is A HERO, white hat and all, even with a few quirks or deficiencies to his character. Not so, here. And the key to the whole picture is buying into Mel as a bad man, all despite his many years in heroic roles beforehand. It works very well, especially in the beginning, where it really needed to. There's an early scene during the credits where Mel forces himself to smile in a mirror, as preparation for putting forth his 'best face' to a teller at a bank. One gets the impression this really is a man unaccustomed to smiling, a sour, angry man. The early scenes also recall the beginning of Miami Blues, that being a criminal swooping into town and wasting no time in bringing a little terror & hardship on certain select bystanders. There's a danger, in a film sense, of satirizing such moments too much, to the point of slapstick comedy - rather than dark comedy, which it really is. But Mel doesn't mess around here he means business, bashing scum left & right, and blowing 'em away as he moves up the ladder of an organized crime organization. The rest of the cast is top-notch, by the way. The casting directors must have had a field day on this one. Then Mel himself is beaten; the whole theme of the movie seems to be about pain how much one can stand; how much one can dish out. It ends up being very cathartic. The cinematography also helps this picture the photography is quite stark,ultra-crisp, adding to the 'punch' of the whole show. The lines on Mel's face are deeper than ever; he seems to carry years of pain there. And years of guilt, maybe.

At the same time, whatever you may think of him or his ideas personally, you have to admit that, generally speaking, the man manages to put out some pretty good movies. But, as we know, every rule has to have an exception. For Mel Gibson, as far as I'm concerned Payback has to be that exception.Payback tries so hard - it tries so very hard. The effort that everybody seems to put into making this an exciting crime and revenge story is so hard that, to be honest, it's almost embarrassing at times. Everything you could possibly think of that could be thrown into a movie like this is thrown into this movie - drugs, gun fights, beatings, torture, murder, prostitution, sadism, masochism, Chinese gangs, organized crime, corrupt cops. Think of anything that could be included in this kind of movie and you'll probably find that it's here somewhere. Often in abundance. Thrown together without any real concern over whether it makes any sense.In the movie, Gibson plays a vicious con man named Porter. He's been betrayed by his wife and ex-partner and left for dead, while they get to keep all $130000 of a heist they pulled off. But somehow Porter survived, and he's out for revenge, assisted by an ex-girlfriend prostitute of his (played by Maria Bello.) The entire opening sequence struck me as absolutely ludicrous. Without giving too much away, I'd love to know (since Porter apparently was left in pretty desperate circumstances) how he managed to connect with the guy who was doing the surgery to remove the bullets. And, although he's a vicious con, we're apparently to believe that he's also rather honest because once he gets started on his quest for revenge, everybody keeps offering him the whole $130000 and he keeps insisting that he only wants the $70000 that was actually his share of the original heist.It has some comedy value. It really does. A sort of tongue in cheek quality that - in the midst of all the violence and ugliness on the screen - actually has the ability to bring a smile to your face on occasion. But that doesn't save it. Not even close.

That is unless one lives in NYC or Los Angeles, then one is out of luck altogether.The film's only saving grace is the wondrous performance of Gregg Henry, an unheralded and grossly underrated actor who was launched at the same time and place as Nick Nolte, in the 1976 TV mini-series, RICH MAN POOR MAN and unlike Nolte, for reasons that defy logic, rather disappeared from the scene. Here, Henry delivers an extraordinary performance as a human ode to Marquis deSade who kicks off the plot by giving the Gibson character's wife a photograph which appears to indicate betrayal.   Ok, so this seems an unlikely reason to cajole her into shooting her husband the back but shoot  she does.  This unremitting, dark film strives for sadism  over logic in every instance.From there on in it is all absolute Grand Guignol,  where one is supposed to squeeze entertainment values from an invidious, fetid mound of unalloyed brutality.

This is practically a remake of John Boorman's hardboiled classic Point Blank (1967), which stars Lee Marvin. Porter is shot down and betrayed by his partners. He recovers and starts his vengeance and quest for the money that was stole from him..I found only one remarkably positive thing about this film and it's the lightning and many flavors of blue and black that create very moody atmosphere that lasts throughout the film. It becomes very gritty and dirty movie as it was intended, and cameraman and Helgeland did great job by creating this color world the film lives in. Of course Mel Gibson is charismatic as Porter and acts perfectly, but those are the only positive things and things I somewhat appreciate about this film. I'm sure mainstream fans love this film as this offers exactly what they want entertainment and an excuse to munch pop corn and have fun watching a movie.The film is full of usual cliches and irritating characters that act so calculatingly as possible. The Gibson character is not any cleaner than the real criminals here and the film is full of despisable, selfish, greedy and disgusting characters that only waste their acting talent in this stupid film. Even policemen are as loathsome as possible. The s/m female played by Lucy Liu is also pretty memorable freak in this film, but doesn't raise the film as a whole any higher.Overall, as I definitely don't like calculating mainstream cinema, I cannot give this more than 3/10 and that is due to the visuality I told about. If you love films like Air Force One, Star Wars Episode One or other similar non-sence entertainment, then you'll probably love Payback as well as this is just the kind of film that should appeal to mainstream audience, especially when it consists of young males.

The studio's script was so bad that Marvin hurled it out of the window of the London house where they both were. Subsequently the idea was re-crafted into a new script -- which became the masterwork Point Blank is. Boorman imagines that Mel Gibson may have been passing in the street and picked the original script out of the gutter where Marvin had thrown it -- and subsequently filmed it as Payback.Boorman says he went around various film festivals telling this story, until, in the run-up to the release of Payback, Gibson rang him and asked him to stop telling it, as it was having a bad effect on Payback's chances! As if Payback didn't do a good enough job all on its own of persuading people it was trash...Payback is utterly worthless; those with no sense for film may enjoy it as mindless pulp but anyone with any feeling for film will find it wildly uneven, graceless and crude. It flails around between clumsily derivative writing and acting, characters with no credible humanity, gratuitous sadism and unfunny slapstick. Some critics here have describes it as uncivilised, and I know what they mean - a film as stupid as this can only come about as a result of pure cynicism.

He planned and participated in a street heist which netted his partners Rosie (Maria Bello) and Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) $130,000.00 which they were suppose to split with him. Instead they kept the entire amount, shot him in the back and left him for dead. Unfortunately for them, he survived and decides to have his revenge. The story follows him as he seeks his share of the heist which leads him to associates of Resnick like Arthur Stegman (David Paymer) who is a low level drug boss but has police protection. Det.

Other hurtles to his money include 'The Outfit' run by a man named Carter (William Devane) who despite his own hit men in turn answers to Justin Fairfax (James Colburn) and eventually Bronson (Kris Kristofferson) who tests Porter's resolve to disastrous ends for nearly everyone involve.

Seen before a thousand times, but still effective.The plot, it isn't a great story with several mind-boggling twists, it just does what it's meant to do - gives a reason for what is happening.I do have some problems with the last act. It's not bad, but it did feel like it was pleasing a whole another crowd. And that's exactly what happened in the production. Helgeland's original vision wasn't respected, and we got a more Hollywood-like last act. You're in luck, because there is a director's cut, which is almost a different movie at the end. I like that one better and love my two movies in one blu-ray of this film, but I happen to like this theatrical cut too. Imagine that. The direct approach to the action in this movie was a bit of a surprise. It really was fun to watch. Don't take me wrong, I am not a guy who cries happy tears when seeing violence, but this was just pure, good, straight to the point - entertainment.

Catharsis meant the creation of characters whose fear, torment or happiness the audience could identify with.  I disliked PAYBACK because I couldn't identify with any of the characters, and the thing that really scares me is to see how many people did identify with the brutish, nasty little thief who stars in this movie.Porter (Gibson) is a professional criminal who plans a brutal robbery, but finds himself cheated out of his own share of the loot.  Now Porter will very unsubtly go about getting his share of the loot back. Not the whole haul, mind you, but only his own share, the share that he stole fair and square.Don't you know somebody like Porter? Haven't you always wanted to do something like what Porter's doing?  Aren't you itching to find out whether Porter outdoes all his fellow bad guys and gets away with his money?  I don't know about you, but for me the answer is no to all three questions. If Porter were at least intelligent about how he goes about his scheme, he might be worthwhile watching, but in fact his tactics are incredibly dumb and succeed only by fiat of screenwriter and director.  For one example, Porter stupidly gives away his greatest advantage, the fact that his adversaries don't know he's alive.  In another scene, Porter asks a Hulking Tough Dude to show him to his criminal boss.  The Hulking Tough Dude refuses, so Porter rips the HTD's earring out.  The HTD immediately whips out a gun and shoots Porter dead.  No, wait, that's what would really happen.  Because we are living in Hayes/Abascal/Helgeland Land, the HTD meekly leads Porter in to see the criminal boss.I have difficulty believing that anything of Brian Helgeland, the screenwriter of the excellent L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, survives in this film, since he was sacked before it was done.  It is much easier for me to blame Terry Hayes, co-writer and author of such stupidity as MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME, and Paul Abascal who was final director.  Whoever may be to blame obviously wanted to take his source material (a Donald Westlake story variously alleged to be either POINT BLANK or THE HUNTER) and turn it into just what we all needed, another take on PULP FICTION.  He got all the bad parts of Tarantino's hit right the mindless, senseless, bloody, and sadistic violence, the characters with no appeal or redeeming features whatsoever, and the darker-than-black humor that generally hurts too much to laugh at.  However, while the dialogue in both films is mostly meaningless, Tarantino's had a spontaneous, natural sound to it; it may have been empty, but it was at least realistic.  Here, the lines sound contrived as well as empty.  Gibson's voice-over narration is omnipresent and irritating, especially when used to reveal points about his character that are already intensely obvious, since there is only one point to his character that he is an unmitigated S.O.B.It takes a lot to earn this disgusting film its one lonely star.  The dark cinematography by Ericson Core conveys the amoral world of Porter convincingly.  Gibson is always watchable, though it's sad to see him play such a one-note role.  (There is a second note, Gibson's romance with Bello, but it's so tacked-on and reeking of cliche that it doesn't count).  Gregg Henry's Val Resnick, the anti-antihero, is appropriately slimy.  Kris Kristofferson plays a character named Bronson who, probably by design, resembles the Bronson we all know and who is vastly more sympathetic than Gibson.  James Coburn reprises his dapper villain role from MAVERICK, which is always fun.  But best of all is Lucy Alexis Liu as Pearl, the sadomasochist to whom all the violence is just a game.These few bright spots failed to distract me from the underlying fact that PAYBACK is a lousy film with a lousy script and at times is damn near unbearable to watch.  The one thing it taught me is a valuable but very disturbing lesson the viewing public has enough sadists who think that screaming, bloody agony is laugh-out-loud hilarious to make dreck like PAYBACK commercially successful.  It's scary.Rating * out of ****. "},{"Title":"I promise you won't have to find out what your left ball tastes like...

Porter heads for his wife to find out where Val is, he quickly learns that Val is now working for the the 'Outfit' a criminal organisation which controls crime in the city & used his money to pay them. As Porter travels across town hurting people & leaving a trail of bodies he not only has Val to deal with but the might of the Outfit, crooked cops & Chinese triads who all either want money or him dead...Payback is one of those films with a troubled production history, maybe we'll never know the full truth but it appears after negative initial test screenings original writer & director Brian Helgeland was fired (apparently just two days after he had won an Oscar for L.A. Confidential (1997)), some say by star Gibson, & replaced by production designer John Myhre who re-shot up to thirty per cent of the film including a drastically different ending which included Kris Kristofferson & the torture scenes none of which are present in the director's cut & as a result the film was delayed by over a year because as soon as the original production on Payback finished Gibson did Lethal Weapon 4 (1998) before doing the re-shoots for this, got that? Good. It's perhaps surprising then that Payback is such a good film, in fact I think it's a brilliant dark noir thriller that is a personal favourite of mine & has been ever since I originally saw it at the cinema all those years ago. The script by Helgeland & Terry Hayes (who is credited with the Theatrical Cut here on the IMDb) was based on the novel 'The Hunter' by Richard Stark & is a deliciously dark tale of revenge, it's told from the perspective of Porter who is a pretty nasty piece of work himself like during the opening sequence when he steals from a homeless beggar for instance which sets the character up perfectly & I just love the the fact that Gibson's character is a bad guy & you end up wanting him to win, it's something very different that I just think works brilliantly. The rest of the larger than life over the top character's are fantastic too, from the criminally underused dominatrix played by Lucy Liu to the funny Fairfax played by James Coburn to the menacing Bronson played by Kristofferson. It moves along at a nice pace, it has a pretty clever & absorbing plot with some cool twists & turns along with a great ending. I just think it's a brilliant film & it's as simple & straight forward as that.This version of the film has a really muted colour scheme with a blue tint, in fact it's not far from being black and white. It's a colour scheme which suits it down to the ground though & is very stylish, the recent director's cut is not tinted in this way & the colour is more vibrant. The violence isn't that excessive but it is fairly brutal at times, Gibson putting a cushion over someones face & shooting them in the head at point bland range for instance & there's a scene where Gibson is tortured which has a bit with a hammer which will make the squeamish amongst you wince. I didn't like the fact that the dog survived being shot in this version though & more realistically it dies in the director's cut. There are some good action scenes & set-pieces as well including some cool sequences with Pearl the dominatrix.With an estimated budget of about $50,000,000 this is very stylishly made, the production design is great & it's a cool film visually. The acting is great as well from a good cast, I've always liked Gibson who is apparently the richest actor in the world... maybe I don't like him so much now! Everyone else puts in really good performances too.Payback is, in my opinion, a brilliant ultra dark thriller with a really cool edge to it. I loved it & thats all there is to it. Director Helgeland & original editor Kevin Stitt got the opportunity in 2005 to compile a 'director's cut' released straight-to-video/DVD in 2006 as Payback Straight Up - The Director's Cut reinstating the original ending & a completely new musical score as well as removing the blue tint from the picture as well as other changes, this 'new' version actually runs 10 minutes shorter than the theatrical cut.

As it happens he's removing a bullet or two from our anti-hero of the hour, someone who lays everything out for us as he lies there on the slab, informing us of what was taken from him and what he's going to get back. The item in question is $70,000; a score he inherited from robbing the aforementioned Chinese gangsters with partner Val Resnick (Henry). The location is an unnamed city, a place we first see by way of an extreme long shot as the lead makes his way over a bridge - the city has that appearance of being cut off from the mainland, as if this scuzzy, hostile, crime infused dystopia is somehow disconnected from the normal world.The stark differences between both Val and Porter is highlighted in this one scene they share, in which either hostilities are at a minimum or they aren't frantically moving around the screen for whatever reason. They stand, street side and watch the Chinese go about their routine. Val is frisky; nervous and energetic &#x96; his blonde hair and effeminate clothing is in stark contrast to Porter's jacket; darkly hued hair and gruff, unemotional tone is the polar opposite to that of Val's appearance. Whilst swiping the case, Val's sadism becomes first apparent in his beating of the Chinese driver. He utters a line along the lines of The trouble is with kickn' a Chow's ass, half an hour later, you want to do it again!, which foreshadows both a violent and sadistic driven relationship with Pearl (Lui), a Chinese mistress. This, as his foil Val sports a name ambiguous in terms of gender; already adding to his dress sense and hair style, somewhat out of sorts for a piece of this genre. Later on, ideas as to how Val strives to survive in this hostile world arise when certain parallels can be drawn between characters.Payback is quintessential noir; a film that ought to be a vital part of any noir cannon, despite all the problems; disagreements and issues that threatened to run it aground prior to release. The film is a smart, highly intelligent and highly enjoyable romp through an unspecified, unhinged city in America in which thieves; back-stabbers; liars; traitors; crooks and criminals rule the majority of the roost. To see it is to experience one of the great films of recent times, and one of the more under appreciated films of our time. It is essentially a blending of generic codes and conventions of hard-boiled noir from Hollywood of the 1940s mixed in with more action orientated American crime pictures about men, their guns and masculinity from the 1970s &#x96; think a Dirty Harry sequel but ten times better.The film's noir archetypes complete with voice-overs blend nicely with the lead's persistent flitting between lonely, down-trodden noir infused lead and gun's-blazing action hero, as he takes on a variety of shady and unlikeable villains out to do more harm than our lead is. The use of specific cars of 'an era' with the sparseness of cellular phones are all obvious ideas employed by the makers of the piece that have been brought to attention before in regards to the inconclusive year in which the film is set, although my favourite tactic applied to the piece which renders the setting ambiguous is the instance in which Porter, having stolen a guy's wallet, looks at the I.D. and reads his date of birth to have been the year 1940 &#x96; the fact the victim looks to be in his thirties suggests a 1970s setting.There have been many writings on the character of the successful gangster being a living embodiment of the 'amoral' American dream; exemplified over the years in many films such as the original Scarface. The high-rise buildings the mafia of this film inhabit during working hours dominate the skyline of an equally shady and sinister city, with the high-rise offices coming to represent the very core of Capitalism iconography. Outside, the American flags are left to fly beside the entrance - they hang, loosely and limply, almost ashamed to fly high and proud because of what lies inside and how it is the inhabitants came to be as rich and successful as they have done by way of the amoral American dream of a gangster lifestyle.The film is full of people chasing a similarly ill-advised and immoral dream, that longing for money that they have not earned cleanly and honestly a corrupt policeman wanting a boat without having to life a finger; a wormy cab dispenser willing to just waltz someone into The Mob for a large bounty; a two-timing thief willing to grass up an old friend. Lead Porter and his plight are consistently made to look a lot more favourable than they actually are. By the end of the film, our lead will have waged a war against police corruption and individuals whom engage in violence against women. The film is one of those minor-masterpieces that feels shunned on release, when in actuality, maintains a promise of delivering an experience of a genre which carries nessesary weight. The film is engageing and smart, while it does not contain thirty seconds that aren't uninteresting. Whilst the majority are incorrectly dismissive, Payback is a fascinating and gripping exercise in a blending of genres with film theory and character.

Now I can put into focus why the two versions (the other being the present film, Payback)have often been compared.First, the two versions are very different. While Payback is informed by the first film's interpretation of the novel, most of it builds a whole new interpretation from the ground up.Point Blank is a very odd film, attempting to interject avant-garde film ideas into a straight mainstream gangster film. It is entirely about the ethics of the central character (Walker in that film, Porter in this, Stark's Parker), a professional criminal bent on revenge. This professionalism - the heart of the Stark novel, by the way - is rather underscored in Point Blank, yet it is essential. Marvin's Walker is, specifically, a professional THIEF; thus the task of the storyteller is to let him get his revenge without actually killing anybody (since that would take him beyond his profession, into the role of murderer, with all sorts of worries attached to it that Walker doesn't really want).Both Payback's director, Helgeland, and star Gibson have missed this entirely. Instead, they are more interested in seeing the character get his revenge in as violent a manner as possible, and still get away with it at the end. Thus, although Gibson's Porter is more clearly a career criminal, he is just not as professional as Walker (or original Parker).This comes out in an oddly romantic way. In Point Blank, after sleeping with him, Walker's sister-in-law thinks she has found her way into his heart; What's my first name? he demands - a question she can't answer since he never bothered to tell her. This relationship isn't going to last very long.Gibson's Porter, on the other hand, finds in the prostitute Rosie the one good thing in life that hasn't been taken away. So Payback will need to find a way of resolving this new, exciting - and very UNprofessional - relationship by the end of the film (and I won't say how).Does this make Gibson's Porter more human than Marvin's Walker? Oddly, no. One reason we're fascinated with Walker is because he is intentionally keeping his real personality hidden from the world. Gibson's Porter, on the other hand, is an open book - he's out for revenge, and we're along for the ride. The multi-dimensionality of the personality melts into the conventions of the genre. Thus despite his being a cold-blooded killer, Porter is really just another variant on the suicidal Vet-cum-Cop Gibson plays in Leathal Weapon. The flatness of the characters in Payback is to some extent relieved by the excellent performances of the cast, all of which make these stereotypical genre figures seem believable - but it's all Hollywood, in the last analysis.One more comparison between the two films is worthwhile here. Point Blank appears to have been made fairly rapidly, but director Boorman's strategic decisions concerning imagery and editing necessitated a remarkable precision in the making of the film.By contrast, and despite delays, Payback looks hurried and sloppy. For one thing, the soundtrack wants to remind us that all this action is taking place around 1970. But since making this film a period-piece would have required much more expense and effort than is visible on screen, we are left with a film about 1990s gangsters who just never grew up.Well, it sounds like I didn't care for Payback very much, but this is not true. Actually, I think Payback is a lot of fun, and I see it at least once a year; Now that I've seen Point Blank, I don't expect to see it again, because its so downbeat. Point Blank is a better film than Payback, but it's really a different film.But films are not (contrary to Hollywood propaganda) just for fun. They can be that, but they can also be something else.personally, I'm now looking forward to somebody savvy enough to make a version of The Hunter as complex as Point Blank and yet also as much fun as Payback. Now THAT would be a movie.

Of course, this means ploughing my way through a large number of movies in a short space of time so I started with this - a dirty and gritty crime film where Mel Gibson started to shed his carefully cultivated 'good guy' image. Seems like a long time ago since he enjoyed such a reputation but the problem I have with this movie is that it's trying too hard to be a neo-noir thriller when all it actually is is a depressing flick where bad people do bad things to worse people.Gibson plays Porter, a professional career criminal with a talent for inflicting pain and a certified mean streak. But when he's betrayed by his old partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) and his wife Lynn (Deborah Unger) for the relatively modest sum of $70'000 and left for dead, Porter begins the long road back to recovery and revenge. But once he starts asking questions, Porter quickly finds that getting his money back is a little harder than he first supposed. First of all, he has a couple of crooked cops on his tail (Bill Duke and Jack Conley) plus Val's twisted mistress Pearl (Lucy Liu) and her goons as well. But Porter's biggest problem is that Val is a small cog in a big machine and Porter doesn't have many friends...Essentially a retread of Point Blank (1967), Payback offers viewers a simple story attempting to be a classic film noir - faded palette, lots of cigarette smoke hanging in the air, a vast collection of low-lifes and scumbags and a narration from a world-weary protagonist. I can't call Porter a 'hero' because he's not - he's just as nasty and vicious as the criminals he's going after. Ultimately, I didn't care whether he got his money back or not and this is only part of the problem. The action took a bloody age to arrive and even then, only in fits and starts which left me feeling short-changed as did the film's short duration, despite the dumb-as-hammers plot. Performances are much better than the material deserved but Gibson is the only one to get any significant screen time. Henry probably has the second-most amount of screen time alongside his Ballistic Ecks Vs Sever co-star Liu and trust me, the bullets act better than they did in that.I should have enjoyed this more because it's right up my street and yet, Payback is missing the magic spark. It feels too grimy, gritty and seedy for its own good as if it will compensate for the lack of interest in proceedings. Like a pig rolling around in the proverbial, Payback is resolutely old-school without having any of the drama, appeal or excitement of proper crime thrillers like... hmmm, let me think Point Blank. If you want a simple and short crime flick that's as grim as a cancer patient's chances then this will do the trick. However, if you're looking for a properly noirish thriller then I reckon you're better off looking elsewhere.

Westlake's novel The Hunter, although I will not attempt a direct comparison of the two films as it is a long time since I last saw Point Blank. Westlake's work has also served as the basis for a number of other crime thrillers, including The Outfit from 1973.The main character is a gangster named Porter; we never learn his Christian name. (The equivalent character was named Walker in Point Blank and Parker in the original novel). The film tells the story of his search for revenge against his ex-wife Lynn and her lover, his former partner Resnick. Porter and Resnick carried out a successful robbery, netting them $140,000, but Resnick and Lynn betrayed Porter in order to cheat him of his share of the proceeds, shooting him in the back and leaving him for dead. To get his revenge, and to reclaim his $70,000 cut, Porter is forced to take on not only Resnick and Lynn but also the Chinese Triads (the victims of the original robbery), the Outfit, a powerful criminal organisation of which Resnick is a member, and two corrupt cops. His only ally is a prostitute named Rosie. The Outfit also featured in the film of that name; the name is probably code for the Mafia, a word which does not actually appear in either film.The film was the directorial debut of Brian Helgeland, previously better-known as a scriptwriter, and is made in the same neo-noir style as his best-known film as a writer, L.A. Confidential. Mel Gibson, who plays Porter, had also made an earlier excursion into neo-noir with Tequila Sunrise. That film was also made by a director, in that case Robert Towne, who had previously been better known as a screenwriter. One of the faults of Tequila Sunrise was that it was too much of a writer's film and not enough of a director's one, being dominated by too much talk and too little action. Helgeland here handles his material much better than Towne did in the earlier film. As a piece of film-making Payback is a grimly efficient piece of work, with a fast-moving storyline, well-handled action sequences and stark, gritty photography of the seedier parts of New York.The main problem is that Payback lacks any sort of heart. The classic films noirs softened the stark good-versus-evil morality of many earlier crime films, bringing a note of moral ambiguity to the crime drama, and this note was repeated in neo-noirs such as L.A. Confidential. Payback does not merely abandon a strict black-and-white notion of morality; it abandons the whole concept of morality altogether. It was advertised under the slogan Get Ready to Root for the Bad Guy, and although Porter is ostensibly the film's hero there is little difference in moral terms between him and his enemies. He sets out to reclaim what he believes is rightfully his, ignoring the fact that because the money is stolen neither he nor Resnick can claim to have any right to it.Gibson is better here than he was in Tequila Sunrise, where he did not bring much menace to his character, Mac McKussic, or suggest his criminal background. Roger Ebert called him the nicest drug dealer you'd ever want to know. Here his Porter is certainly menacing. The trouble is he's the nastiest hero you'd never want to know, prepared to carry out any crime up to kidnapping and murder for the sake of $70,000. The result is that, whereas Payback is a film one can occasionally admire, it is impossible to love or even to like very much. 6/10 "},{"Title":"The top is no longer what it used to be in gangsterland","Date":"30 July 2010","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Strangely enough it is a gangster film full of faithlessness and hypocrisy, hatred and greed and yet the good guys turn out to be a gangster and a prostitute.

But in this world there is always a comeback and then a payback and the payback is always proportional to the distance to catch up on the comeback journey, and when it is near death that was the starting point of this comeback you can be sure the payback will implicate a lot of money and a lot of metal. And it does and it is not that easy to go to the top of the drug dealing business, and that sure is not easy and there are many hurdles. We wonder why he got down in front of the last one, or is it a way to really trap the boss. But he is also a very creative hit man in his come back and he pays back a lot with the metal, explosive and guns of those he shot down or he wants to bring down. He is flexible, adaptable, opportunistic and his principle is not to hit higher than the top but to hit the top just to get his due and he gets it and he does not have to share in the end. That's what is good in this gangster film. The gangster really gets our hearts in his hands because he is just asking for justice from his fellow gangsters who don't seem to have any sense of justice, nor the few cops he comes across either.

The Lee Marvin version was very good but had a film noir atmosphere to it. Point Blank has recently appeared on DVD and is worth watching. For its day it was a brutal film. The violence in Payback is more graphic but the story is still a solid one. A key element (and a source of humour) is Porter's insistence on retrieving his $75,000 though the mob thinks it is more because the heist was double (Porter doesn't want his partner's share though he was betrayed by him). A previous reviewer said Payback seemed like a film written for the 1970's. Point Blank was made around 1967.

Both Porter/Walker work their way from the bottom lackeys to the top man to exact their revenge.

Westlake's nom de plume must be Richard Stark or vice-versa or someone is plagiarizing. Be that as it may, both films are well scripted especially for each leading man, where each uses terse, punctuated lines to deliver his message.

Sadly, she only makes it to a third of the picture. And I loved 'Carter', one of the Outfit's bosses, brilliantly played by William Devane. This guy has no illusions on what he does.

When we are first introduced to Porter (Mel Gibson), we are told in voice over that basically, he's a bad man.  Not only are we told, he shows us exactly how bad he is.  This bit was done brilliantly, however, don't let it mislead you--the rest of the film is not exactly like the beginning. The reason why Porter is so annoyed is because he was double-crossed by a business partner of his a while back and had $70,000 stolen from him. He's back now, and he wants what belongs to him.  A good set up. Everything about the film is still dandy until it falls into typical Mel Gibson, Lethal Weapon conventions with the introduction of Kris Kristopherson's character (though Kris is always a great bad guy).  Even the once brilliant writing at this point turns into complete cheese.  What happened?  Well, for those of you that keep up with the gossip surrounding film productions, you know that the studio and Gibson clashed with the writer/director and ended up reshooting a third of the film.  The reasoning? Gibson and the studio felt that the film was too dark.  Well, congratulations Mel, you've turned what could have been a very original and respectable film into a cliche copy of your Lethal Weapon films.

But it surprised me--it has levity, style, and punch. It's a smart movie. It has some creaks, a couple of moments of excessive violence, some humor that may or may not strike you--in other words, it might not be perfect. But it's really good.There are few films since 1960 that are true film noirs in character, and this one is genuine in terms of style. That alone makes it worth watching. The color throughout is a cool, drained palette. Camera angles are dramatic, there is a voice-over (Gibson) that approaches the classic style, and the core idea of the lone guy against the world is at play. Compared to post-War noirs this one is a selfish, violent binge--it's not trying to be about some soldier returning to a changed country. If anything, the plot is where we go contemporary--borrowing an awful lot from the classic (and also brilliantly filmed) Point Blank, the one with Lee Marvin.There are some other nice surprises here. For one, an Asian s&m hooker is a total campy comic relief (and her badass caricatured comrades in their SUV). Another is the avoidance of mob clichés (the ones cemented by the Godfather movies more than anything)--it plays against them as much as with them. The cars are great, the city is gloomy without rain. It's a kind of dystopian near-past with modern attitudes. Strange stuff that might wear well with the decades.I'm glad I didn't see it in 1999 because it would have probably just seemed thin and full of itself. Now it has the makings of originality and style.But get this--this is the original version of the release, and the director Brian Helgeland went back to the original footage in 2006 to re-work, re-edit, and re-release the same movie. Guess what he took out? All the things I liked here--the cool tonality, the noir sensibility, the humor. I haven't seen the new one so won't compare or judge, but the director felt that the original release (which luckily they can't take away from us) wasn't what he had envisioned. The new one, which is apparently more cruel and violent, is called Payback Straight Up and it might be worth checking out.But I wouldn't hesitate to see this one, straight up. I liked it!

Porter's character is essentially a bad guy and probably worse than some of the people he dispatches of but nevertheless you root for him and take great enjoyment in watching him at work. Mel Gibson fits the role perfectly and never does the story try to give him more of a sympathetic plight although it's established that he has some human tendencies. He's simply bent on revenge and everything that comes between him and his money is fair game.The soft/dim look of the film richly sets the tone and the music is great, together creating a retro look that harks back to the old noirs of the day. The level of excessive violence and Porter's lack of compassion set the film further apart from the usual revenge scenarios found in most crime films today.The script does take a few convenient turns, making Payback not all that believable in parts, but honestly, I can't say that a few implausibilities here and there deter from the overall enjoyment.Supporting cast is right on the money, with old vets like Kris Kristoffersen, William Devane and James Coburn turning in terrific performances. Maria Bello makes for a very likable love interest and Gregg Henry finds new lows for one of Porter's main villains.I can't wait for the revised Director's Cut.

You do not need to know any of the previous film references to make this story work and it stands up just fine on its own, thank you very much.Others have commented on Gibson's portrayal versus Marvin's, but consider the context in which each film was made Without taking anything away from Marvin's performance I would argue that Gibson delivers the goods in just as satisfying a manner. Gibson's portrait is more of a twenty-first century graphic novel's character approach to justice than Marvin's 1967 nod to cool spy culture and a bad-ass anti-hero's approach to injustice.The author/director clearly worked this story until it was a lean, mean fighting machine, ruthlessly taking out what didn't serve the story so that the overall effect is amazing pacing and audience satisfaction by turns of curiosity and empathy with this anti-hero. You cannot make this stuff up from brilliant inspiration, only very hard work can make a story this simple and elegant hang together with such artful complexity.I admit I am a fan of Gibson's work, but not all of his oeuvre is worth watching. This one definitely is, no matter what you think about his personal biases, love life, etc.And although this film is not outwardly credited (as far as I can tell) with having inspired Guy Richie, you can clearly see that this film and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels are part and parcel of a similar vision of late nineties' heroism, combined with very clever cinematography, excellent direction and muscular storytelling.

After managing to survive, Porter starts a single-minded pursuit of the 70K (out of which he got gypped) and a little revenge along the way. As Porter shoots and hacks his way to claim what's rightfully his, director Brian Helgeland seems to be doing the same to a lot of the banal paradigms set up by lots of the crime films, (with the exception of a brief interlude during the late 60's and 70's), that have come before it. After all, just once wouldn't it have been great to see Cagney treading over the corpses of his enemies, a satchel of dough in one fist, a rod in the other and a healthy looking broad waiting for him behind the wheel of a getaway car? Helgeland hedges his bets a bit with a little cartoonishness, but mostly it's played pretty straight with a smattering of sardonic fun.

I just never got around to seeing it in the theater.  Now, many months later, I finally get around to watching it at home.  I must say, it was pretty entertaining.  Mel Gibson was good as a not to nice guy.  He steals, he shoots, and he beats up people.  But who can blame him?  He gets shot and cut out of his cut of money that was owed to him.  Throughout the rest of the movie, Mel has to dodge crooked cops, Chinese gangs, and mobsters to get back the 70, 000 that's rightfully his.  Like the tag line says, you start liking Mel's character and you want to see him succeed in his quest.  I especially liked the scene between him and James Coburn.  Of course, at the end, Mel's character does seem on the path to redemption.  He got his 70 grand and he got out alive.

So I went to see it with a friend and in the break (we have that here in Europe I don't know if you have it too in the States) we went home and I don't do that very often (did it about twice till now).So, the story is slow, boring and there's nothing new in it.

Following the sequels, Gibson made a highly praised debut in 'Lethal Weapon' franchise starring opposite Danny Glover. Fresh out of his wonder years as the gun-totting L.A police detective, Gibson makes once again another appearance as a trigger happy protagonist in this revenge thriller directed by Brian Helgeland. Gibson plays Porter, a merciless, bad-to- the-bone thief who makes no way to make a living than to rob and pick-pocket innocent neighbors of their money and worse of all, the criminals in his neighborhood that surround are certainly no better. After a half-successful robbery from an Asian street gang known as The Outfit, Porter is betrayed by his partner Val Resnick (played by Gregg Henry) and wife Lynn Porter (played by Deborah Kara Unger) who shoot in cold blood and leave him for dead. However, when Porter miraculously survives he seeks assistance from his ex- lover and former partner Rosie (played by Maria Bello) to deliver vengeance and claim back his money while making his way through a world of vicious drug dealers, prostitutes, and corrupt law officials. Mel Gibson has sported many clever and memorable during his year, arguably his most memorable in 'Lethal Weapon' series or as the British warrior in war epic 'Braveheart'. His role as the protagonist in this film is certainly not as memorable and definitely not as appealing as many of the heroic characters he's known for. While he gives a performance that allows him to suit well in this role, he doesn't quite bring the same sort of charisma he had in his role in Lethal Weapon. Fortunately, he still manages to entertain during gunfight sequences. Watching Gibson mow down the bad guys in a bloody, bullet-blazing frenzy is fun to watch, at least for a little while. But the rest of the time, the film is a bit tedious. From the opening scene, the plot starts off with a promise and progresses into something bigger, and it works at least the first hour. But towards the final stretch, the story falls a bit clumsy and becomes less engaging. On the bright side, the supporting cast does manage to spit out some entertaining performances along the way packing in some dark humor that works at least part of the time, particularly Gregg Henry as Mel Gibson's partner with a hidden agenda on his hands. His performance isn't quite strong, but it holds up. One of the biggest surprises comes Lucy Liu who plays a prostitute of the Asian street gang, quite a questionable role for her.Payback is not your average Mel Gibson actioner and probably sits the lower ladder of Gibson's filmopgraphy. Nonetheless, it is still entertaining on some level and has its moments of spectacle in the midst of its subpar script and plot. This revenge flick is one that will please some but definitely not all, particularly those who go in expecting something on the level of Lethal Weapon.

It just confused me at times, and failed to entertain me for most of the film. The one thing I was anticipating was Porter (Mel Gibson) to get his revenge on Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) and I got that, but it happened halfway through the movie which came completely unexpected for me and was kind of a disappointment. I thought he was going to be the film's main antagonist for Porter, but before Val Resnick is killed by Porter were introduced to a higher-up in The Outfit that Resnick owed money to.So now I'm to assume he is going to be Porter's main antagonist, but when Porter confronts him about getting his $70,000 he informs Porter that he can't give him the money, but only his boss can. So now were introduced to Bronson (Kris Kristofferson) Porter's primary antagonist now, and by far the most compelling. Sadly, he's not given much to do before he is blown up in the apartment where the phone was rigged with a bomb from earlier in the movie. I think I was mostly able to piece this movie together after I finished it, but when I did I really didn't care.

Right from the start, its washed-out colour palette effectively evokes the classic film noir look and the addition of a world-weary narration also contributes to the rather ominous atmosphere of the piece.Predictably, for a revenge thriller, there's plenty of action, violence and explosions and a whole gallery of colourful characters that include gangsters, prostitutes and crooked cops. The dialogue is also brilliant throughout and ranges from a typically hardboiled voice-over to some darkly humorous one-liners.Following a heist in which some Chinese gangsters were relieved of $140,000, Porter (Mel Gibson) is betrayed by his two accomplices when his wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) shoots him in the back, leaves him for dead and takes off with his partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry) and all the loot. After having bullets removed from his back by a whisky-drinking doctor and taking five months to recuperate, Porter sets out for revenge and to recover his cut from the heist which amounts to $70,000. His mission is complicated however, because soon after he traces his drug-addicted wife, she dies from a heroin overdose and then he learns that Resnick is unable to pay up because he'd needed $130,000 to repay a debt he owed to a crime syndicate known as the outfit.With the help of Rosie (Maria Bello), an outfit-connected call girl for whom he used to act as a driver and bodyguard, Porter then pursues the repayment of his money with incredible determination and despite being beaten up and tortured at different stages, remains totally single-minded as he confronts a whole series of the outfit's mobsters. Inevitably, his endeavours eventually bring him into a confrontation with the outfit's top man who's the only one who actually has the authority to repay him but, of course, has no intention of doing so, especially after Porter kidnaps his son.Porter, who's only known by his surname throughout the whole movie, is introduced as a despicable anti-hero who steals money from a street beggar, picks the pocket of a random man in the street and steals cigarettes from a woman who works in a diner. He's regarded as insane by all the mobsters who think that the risks he takes in pursuit of a mere $70,000 are absurd. He obviously sees things differently though because, in his mind, what he's doing involves a matter of principle and this provides the movie with a running joke as, at various times, members of the outfit talk about making higher payments only for Porter to reiterate that the sum he's pursuing is just the $70,000.Mel Gibson is well-suited to his role as he's convincingly tough and violent but also adds a certain tongue-in-cheek quality which distinguishes his performance from that of Lee Marvin's in Point Blank. The rest of the cast is also very good with Kris Kristofferson, James Coburn and William Devane all standing out and Lucy Lui absolutely sensational as a highly-enthusiastic, leather-clad dominatrix whose sudden outbursts of violence are both physically impressive and comical at the same time.Payback is visually strong, nicely paced and features some well-executed action sequences. It's thoroughly entertaining from start to finish and despite not reaching the standards set in John Boorman's original, is enjoyable, full of atmosphere and well worth watching.

Gibson plays Porter, a nasty, violent criminal who's betrayed by his strung out whore bag wife (Deborah Kara Unger), and volatile nutbar of a partner (Gregg Henry, coked up and starting fights with anything that has a pulse), following a heist. They shoot him up real good, and take his share of the payout. This pisses Porter off well and good. After recovering, he climbs his way up the corporate ladder of crime, one bullet, punch, kick and slice at a time, to get his 24,000$ bucks. He's not looking for a million, or to take over anyone's organization, just his cut, which becomes a running joke, and a nice character nuance for Gibson to play on. He's a scrappy mess as the ultimate spit on antihero, and it's a blast to watch him maul anyone in his path in a reckless spree of delightful wanton violence to get what's his. Gibsons is at his best when he's playing bad, and here's he's the worst apple of the bunch, a burnt out scumbag on a one way road to self destruction, but thanks to his skills and natural charm, we just can't help but root for the guy. Kris Kristofferson icily plays a crime syndicate honcho, Maria Bello is the hooker with a heart of gold, James Coburn provides comic relief as a hysterical mob boss (Thats just mean, man!!), Bill Duke and Jack Conley leave a trail of slime as corrupt cops, and there's great stuff from William Devane, David Paymer, and a startingly young Lucy Liu as an enthusiastic Triad S&M hooker.

Payback is pretty brutal at times, but doesn't make a huge point out of it, either.Another thing with Payback, is the acting. I enjoy the acting of several of the characters here.

Seems like Brian Helgeland knows what he wants from his actors.There's some stuff about the plot here that might be hard to swallow for some people, some coincidences you kind of have to suspend your disbelief to accept, but I usually don't care much about stuff like that. There is a lot of smoking in this movie, and that's good to see! I miss the days where pretty much every protagonist and antagonist smoked their ass off in almost every scene. Haha. Interestingly, even with the brutality of this movie, it also has quite a lot of humor mixed in. Some of it I don't know if was meant to be humor, but I found it to be a nice touch anyhow.

You know how you always think of the perfect thing to say ten minutes too late, well, in this flick Mel never misses a beat, and it's quite entertaining. The violence is pretty much non-stop from beginning to end, but it is non-stop with very high production values and mostly not excessively graphic, much of it actually played for sick humor. There's a complete lack of characters with any redeeming traits at all in this movie. There is not one single person that you would like to have anything to do with in real life. It is just degrees from really, really bad to completely, utterly horrible, which is why you wind up rooting for Mel--he's just the best looking and least reprehensible out of a despicable line-up. With all that said, this film grabs your attention at the beginning and never lets go. The script is particularly clever, and there are no bad performances (although, obviously, Kris Kristofferson's serious acting career is more expired than year-old warm milk). Therefore, I must do two things. First, I have to give this film full marks, because it perfectly accomplished everything it set out to do.

Mel Gibson plays Porter, a successful street hustler who is double-crossed and shot repeatedly by his wife and partner. Once out of jail he searches for the cash his partner stole from him. His wife overdoses on drugs so he seeks out a past girlfriend. Many violent encounters follow, which deflate any message intended.

Gibson holds strong as someone wronged and intends to even the odds. Unfortunately he does so through applauded revenge. Greg Henry as his former partner never rises above conventions and basically becomes a target. Maria Bello as a past girlfriend serves only as a love interest. Deborah Kara Unger is the only supporting role of any interest. She is very good as his wife who betrayed him and has reduced herself to drug addiction before it catches up to her.

The story begins with a man named Porter (Mel Gibson). He's been double-crossed and left for dead. He was supposed to get $70,000 from a buddy of his after the two of them pulled off a daring robbery but his cash was taken from him and now, he wants it back. Trouble is that the man he's after, Val Rescnick (Gregg Henry) has been busy while he was recuperating. Now to get his money, which has been completely spent, he's going to have to go higher up than his former friend, he's going to have to tear down one mob higher-up after another. As you can imagine, the Mafiosos do not take kindly to his request.What works with the film is that while the story isn't necessarily all that revolutionary, there are some good twists throughout and the characters are memorable. I mean it in a good way when I say that the characters here are very broad and cartoonish, because every single character is that way. Porter is stubborn to the point of being psychotic. He insists on getting his money, no matter the cost. Personal loss? Injury? Who cares. It's all about getting his $70,000. No more, no less because that's what he is owed. It's the natural order of things for people to get what's coming to them, so if anyone gets in his way, then what they had coming to them was a bullet to the head. What I liked with our protagonist was that the movie doesn't wimp out and make him a thief that plays nice with children or has a soft spot and refuses to hit women or anything like that. The character is a real dirt bag. He's not above stealing from criminals or innocent people as long as it means getting closer to his goal. This is where the movie gets good because there are a ton of obstacles in Porter's way and each detour or change of plans brings in a new character that's a ton of fun to follow. Most of the guys we see Porter go up against are even more despicable than he is so you cheer for him when he blows them away or finds a way to get them out of his hair.In terms of secondary characters we've Porter's former partner Val. You don't like him because he's a fool and everyone around him knows it. Betraying your best friend to pay back a mob debt, just so you could get yourself into an even bigger mess? Not cool. Next we have some amateur gangsters that figure because everybody else is going after Porter, they're going to sneak in and nab 'em to make a good impression. David Paymer plays Arthur Stegman, a bottom-feeder who you enjoy seeing because you know he's in way over his head and eventually, he's going to realize it too... the hard way. Next are two corrupt cops, one of the biggest thorns in Porter's side. Their interactions with our hero prove that he is able to think quickly on his feet and these guys are so slimy they're a joy to watch. Finally we've got two fun female characters as well. A call girl named Rosie (Maria Bello) who proves to be one of the few allies Porter can find in this crazy story (but even then, can she really be trusted?) and we've got Lucy Liu as Pearl, a dominatrix that ends up getting the hots for our protagonist. The film is often very funny because everyone is so outlandish and you can never predict what kind of new and colorful thug is going to show up next to ruin Porter's day.Part of the fun of seeing Payback is getting this glimpse at a most seedy underground, but a lot of it is simply seeing a guy so determined to get what's his that he is willing to do anything. There are a lot of moments of tension as your mind races, wondering how our hero is going to get himself out of a jam and you even sweat for some of the bag guys, who are too taken aback by Porter's black-and-white view of the. My understanding is that the VHS version of the film is significantly different from the one that is available on Blu-ray and DVD but that just makes me excited to watch this film again and compare the two. If you happen to find this one at a garage sale or you have an old dusty box of tapes in your attic, dig it out and give it a shot. Once in a while you want a hero that isn't squeaky clean. A guy that it turns out, did commit the murder he was thrown in jail for, but is the best man for the job so you're forced to go along with his adventures. When that's what you want, check out Payback because it delivers.

Mel Gibson was riding high at the Box Office in 1999, Lethal Weapon 4 and Conspiracy Theory both opened at No 1, and made over $100 million World Wide, while Ransom was the 5th highest-grossing film of 1996 in the United States, and he picked up the Oscar for Best Director and Best Movie for 1995's Braveheart. Henry is well cast as the sleazy, slimy, bully Val, David Paymer, Bill Duke, James Coburn and Kris Kristopherson all have good supporting roles, but it is Lucy Lui (appearing as Lucy Alexis Liu) that steals the movie as the violent dominatrix Pearl. Then there is Mel Gibson, he is the star and simply the core of the movie. The movie simply would not work with a lesser actor as the anti hero Porter. He would only act for a few more years as the lead in movies after this one, before a seven year beak between 2003-2010. One can't help but wonder what other wonderful films we may have missed out on. Gibson is truly a great actor, and hopefully he can sort his personal problems and demons out, because as we all know Hollywood loves comebacks.A solid movie with Gibson bringing his A game.

As such Mr Porter is the type of character I like because they are smart and are always out-thinking their opponents. It is something that I could never become, but I do admire people with that ability. I guess the catch is that either Mr Porter is really smart, or those who he is dealing with are really dumb.The thing that is cool about this movie is that it is funny. It is the type of movie with a lot of wit and the occasional clever one liner. I simply liked the way Porter conducted himself, and how he was never concerned with those blackmailing him because he is able to handle himself. If he wasn't then he would not be alive. The previews suggest that he is a good guy, but he is really not - Porter is a crook who is dealing with crooks.This movie seems to borrow things from gangster movies, and the scenes are all dark and dirty. We are not looking at a good against bad, we are looking at gangsters fighting gangsters, and as such the scenes reflect that. Even the very wealthy scenes have the feeling of a dark and dirty reality. This movie is cool, and one of Mel Gibson's better ones.

Gibson played a guy named Porter. We never learn his Christian name and the villains have a tough time remembering not only his name but also the amount of money that he demands. You see, our career criminal protagonist accompanied another hoodlum on a robbery. They steal $140 thousand from three Chinese gangsters who are on their way to launder their loot. Our heroes collide with them in a back alley. Literally, Porter crashes head-on into these guys who aren't wearing their seat belts. No sooner have Val (Gregg Henry) and Porter stolen the money from them than Val engineers a double-cross using Porter's own wife to kill him. The problem is that Lynn doesn't put nearly enough slugs into her husband to keep him down for the count. The film opens with Gibson explaining in a voice-over about his predicament. Since he is a criminal, he cannot walk or stumble into a hospital emergency room with two bullets embedded in his back and expect to leave with the doctors filling out a report about a shooting. Five months later after our protagonist has recovered from the shooting, he goes after Val to get his money back. As it turns out, Val used the loot to payback a debt that he owed to the mob. Now, he is a mob-protected man and lives in their hotel, the Oakwood, on Union and 17th where he enjoys all the comforts of home. Porter awakens him to the reality of a new day and demands that he get his $70-thousand. Naturally, Val tries to talk his way out of it, but Porter doesn't believe a word of it. He shoots him through a pillow and then starts working on the next rung up the ladder to the mob.This Mel Gibson crime thriller is extremely violent, smartly written, and crisply staged. Our hero negotiates an obstacle to recover his dough. He is beaten up, shot at, and has two of his toes crushed during a ruthless mob interrogation. Everybody is flabbergasted that he wants only $70-thousand. One mobster (James Coburn) observes that some of the apparel in his alligator luggage costs more than Porter insists he be paid back. The thing about Payback that makes it so exciting is that Porter doesn't mince words. He says what he means and means what he says. He doesn't fear the mob. This is one of Mel's strongest films where he plays a villainous type. Although he is a bad guy, the mobsters that he tangles with are far more dastardly.

A surgeon removes the bullets and Porter spends months healing. He then begins tracking down Val Resnick (Gregg Henry), his former partner, and Lynn (Deborah Unger), his ex-wife, both of whom left him for dead following a $140,000 heist from the Chinese triads.Although this is probably one of Mel Gibson's best roles, I have to also give a shout-out to the character Bronson (Kris Kristofferson). Sure, Brian Helgeland's Bronson was not supposed to be like this, and I do love Helgeland... but how can you deny the sheer awesome of Kris Kristofferson? Truly a force of nature.This film shares the same source material as Point Blank (1967), directed by John Boorman and starring Lee Marvin.

I say that being fully aware that it recycles old fashioned crime pieces from the 70's. But this film makes it all seem new to us, mainly because of the unusually insightful performances. Mel Gibson is colder than ice as Porter, while maintaining an undercurrent of sarcasm, that we as an audience can appreciate him for. Gregg Henry plays Res nick...Porter's partner in crime who double crosses him over 140,000 dollars. Val Resnick is one of my favorite movie characters of all time...mainly because I love to hate him. He's a true dirt bag, and the character isn't afraid to show it. Most of the film's classic lines come from val re snick...including a hilarious scene where Val and another character named Artie Stegman, get into a heated conversation in a restaurant. Artie comforts him, ...this one's on me val. Val's reply...do you see me reaching for my f****g wallet? If you don't find that funny, then you might not like a lot of Payback's mean spirited sarcasm. Lucy Alexis Lu also joins the entourage...as a sadistic s & m prostitute. She abuses Val and appears not to care about him...but that's what turns him on. She eventually comes in contact with Porter, as he is on the hunt for his stolen cash, and the two both end up beating on Val Res nick together. This all will come off very strange for viewers expecting a typical, straightforward crime saga. If that is what your looking for, look elsewhere. payback is the definition of style over substance. Towards the end, we too feel like we have been through hell in a hand basket...but in a fun, exciting kind of way. By the time we meet Fairfax, Bronson, and Bronson's kidnapped son, little Johnny, we begin to smile at the film's street smart savvy attitude. We admire the criminals for their audacity...sympathize for a gangster...fall in love with hookers...feel the pain as a hammer swings down on a bare foot. I think I have established that this film is not for everyone. It is about street smarts and dirt. It is pure earth...no lessons or fairy tales. But I personally loved it...because by the end we no longer care about the 140,000. We just want to get away with all the mayhem Scot free. Porter can vouch for that. This film is like getting beat up, punched and kicked, and thrown out of a night club. It was an assault on the senses...but damn was it fun.

"},{"Title":"Point Blank remake reflects the pretension of its own times more than it does the original","Date":"8 April 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Why do remakes? I guess it's usually to make money because most remakes don't improve upon the original. Well anyway this is a remake of the 1967 Point Blank that starred Lee Marvin and John Vernon. The original broke new ground for its time, and it is a classic, and it showed just how terrific an actor Lee Marvin was. In fact the whole cast was memorable.Payback in the version I saw is the director's cut and it's a good movie, not excellent by any means, but good, watchable, and tight. Apparently an earlier version was messed up, and many reviews here are of that version.The story is simple. Gibson is betrayed by a partner in crime who takes his share of the loot (robbed from some other bad guys) and joins the Outfit. Gibson, left for dead, recovers and goes up against the Outfit and some corrupt cops to recover his loot. Since it's a case of one bad guy going up against other bad (even worse) guys, we are able to identify with Gibson. After all, he was almost killed by his partner.Now, there are some story changes that need not detain us. They do not really enhance the new version over the old. In the old one, Marvin lost his two-timing woman to his buddy, and that twist is gone.I really did not want to compare Marvin to Gibson, whose acting I respect, but I could not help but notice the vast difference in how they handled the part. Marvin did a far better job at it. Sorry, Mel. I like your work a lot, but Lee managed to convey all the emotions, from anger to steely determination to humor and more, much better. Gibson gave us a kind of stolid one-note bull-headedness.The new version injects some of the pretensions and tone of this newer age of movies, and these do not help this film or modern films in general. In particular, every so often (usually way too often) there is a kind of juvenile joking around, sometimes swearing, sometimes over the top bits of behavior or dialogue, that detract from the seriousness of the story. These alter the tone of the movie. They break the mood. They detract from the movie's realism. Too many people at too many times behave like children or make wisecracks that are childish or out of place or counter the mood. They break down the flow of tension and suspense, and they ruin any hope of presenting a story that has integrity from start to finish.It is totally unimaginable that the kinds of things I am talking about would ever appear in La Strada or The Asphalt Jungle or Flamingo Road or The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, or any number of films like these. They had humor at times, they had humanity, they had all sorts of human behavior, and it seemed more real and more grown up and more believable. The modern injections of pretensions are as if the writers are afraid to write something strong and see it through, all the way through, without interrupting it with some nonsense.Payback had mercifully few of these moments, but it had some. It did not escape this general curse that undercuts the seriousness of the story and thus its capacity to engage the viewer, or at least this viewer who is used to older movies and who is continually giving newer movies serious consideration. But I must say that even without these awkward moments, I am not seeing levels of emotion conveyed or conflicts brought out except at relatively superficial levels in many scenes. It's like seeing a cartoon substitute for a painting that has many shades. Exaggeration does not substitute well for true dramatic conflict.Overall, Payback is pretty much by the modern numbers while utilizing some of the Point Blank story.

Quite the contrary, a premise like this is little more than a way to get people to expect a heightened level of blood and violence in the movie, it gives the special effects people an excuse to do creative things with ball hammers and to make the audience find even the most brutal murders to be `quite fun and funny,' as one IMDb reviewer put it.For some reason, however, I wasn't entirely amused to see a guy get shot in the shoulder and then the knee, and when he fails to produce a lighter when asked for a light, he gets a pillow pressed over his face and gets shot in the forehead. Granted, this was a very bad guy and had double crossed Porter (Mel Gibson, the GOOD guy) in one of the worst ways imaginable, and there is nothing that you want more than to see this guy fall, but that certainly doesn't make it amusing or even cheerful. I weep for the obvious descent of mankind into barbarism if people laughed at this. Let's consider the plot here. Mel Gibson is a criminal, and a good one at that. He and his wife are involved in crime that involves high risk and massive payoffs, and when one score results in the acquisition of $130,000, he and she and their partner, Val (Gregg Henry) begin discussing the splitting of the money. Porter calmly says that they will split it like they agreed in the first place, even though it turned out to be less than they expected, and Val and Lynn (Porter's wife) turn on Porter, shooting him in the back, taking all the money for themselves to run away together, and leaving him for dead. Five months later, Porter is recovered again and is out to get his money by whatever means necessary. The important thing here is that he is obviously so disappointed when he is forced to use violence that his shoulders droop to let us know that it's the last thing in the world that he wants, and on top of that, he wants $70,000, not $130,000. All he wants is his share, even after all he's been through. So how's he the bad guy again?Under the circumstances, it's amazing how obvious it is that presenting Porter as the bad guy is a weak ploy to get more violence into the movie, and it is a terrible sign of the state of our society that people enjoyed this. Try watching a movie like Payback and then watch Michael Moore's brilliant documentary Bowling for Columbine, you won't be so eager to root for the `bad guy' after all. On the one hand, Payback is a quality action film with plenty of car crashes and guns and killing and death, all the necessary ingredients for an action film these days, but the premise is such a weak scheme that it drastically lowers the rest of the movie. Lucy Liu, however, can be seen in a relatively early role looking sexier than anyone should really be allowed to look in a movie. I was almost depressed when it was over, she looked so good.I do not want to give the impression that Payback was a bad film or that I completely condemn it for it's ploy to get as much violence as possible into it, I just think that it could have been a much better movie if they hadn't laid so much emphasis on its violent content. Even the obligatory action movie hottie only added to the enjoyment of it all (I'm sure female viewers felt the same, of course), so it is certainly a movie that is likely to be enjoyed by action fans. The rest of you, however, may want to be a little more careful. The violence, at least at one point, is literally stomach-turning.

One day while pulling a robbery, he's double crossed by his wife and his best friend. Shot in the back, he's left for dead in a parking garage. Of course if he was dead, there would be no movie. So, five months later, he's back on his feet and out for revenge. His wife has turned into an addict, and his best friend Val (Gregg Henry) has joined a group that's known as The Syndicate (or The Outfit depending on who you're talking to.) So in order to get back his $70,000 (his half of the robbery money) Porter is forced to track down Val, and at the same time, knock off The Syndicate. I've been reading that people said this film is too violent. Shocking brutality and all that stuff. But I didn't think it was any more violent that any other action movie out there. The difference is the good guy is actually a bad guy. Porter is a criminal who enjoys what he does. If it involves shooting someone, he'll do it. If he has to frame some cops along the way, he'll do it. I don't think people are used to the hero of a movie killing people without reason. But I found it quite fun and funny. Not that I'm for random acts of violence or anything. But on a movie screen it's enjoyable. And Porter does have his redeeming qualities. When he looks up an old girlfriend (Maria Bello), you see that he does have a heart. Also, they never really explain who The Syndicate is, but it seems to be a Mafia type organization. Either way, when you get William Devane, James Coburn, and Kris Kristofferson as the main guys in The Syndicate, you know you're in for a good time.

He's hard, classy and gets the girls, while he can afford also turn down a couple as well. But why do we like Porter? Cause he's the bad guy.Porter gets backstabbed by his wife and 'Buddy' when doing a basic robbery from a Chinese outfit (bad guys.) He's shot by his wife and is left for dead, but with a lovely introduction sequence, we see him getting the bullets removed from his back and set back to this world looking for revenge.No matter what anyone says, Porter is bad! He steals from beggars, uses other peoples credit cards, rips out nose-rings without hesitation, shoots fine suit-cases etc etc. But if Porter is the bad guy, then who are the 'baddies?' Well he just goes from bad to worse. Basically he climbs the table, from scum to likable crime bosses (enter James Coburn) he fights his way to the top for one thing, his share of the money that got him shot in the first place. How much you ask. $70,000.The movie is of a very old style. Blue tint throughout the film, classic soundtrack, sexy women and cool guns. Gibson's preferred choice is one that his Lethal Weapon partner would be proud of.I am one for noticing mistakes though. When you watch it, look out for the part where Porter is hit by the Chinese car in the alleyway. When they hit him, the car windscreen is smashed, but when the cops pull up and drive away, they managed to get a repair job! Pretty smart that, i should get their number!!!Mistake, who cares. Payback is one class movie and i suggest you see it, guys will thinks its cool, girls will love Gibson so all in all, it's a good all rounder.The funny thing is, no matter how this film ends, the bad guy wins, cause there aren't any 'goodies!!!'Pesty  "},{"Title":"Gibson isnt that believable in the bad guy role","Date":"20 May 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"   After a score, Gibson is screwed over by his partner and shot and left for dead.

Obviously the expectations were there to shoot this one in the foot before it even got off the ground (adapting Westlake's book, the excellent John Boorman movie of that book, Point Blank) but Brian Helgeland's film delivers the goods in grandiose and brutal fashion. It is oddly reminiscent of the Warner Brothers thrillers of the 70's, plain red titles playing over the opening scenes, Chris Boardman's nostalgic and mean as a junk yard dog score and of course, Mel Gibson as Porter. The film, shot in what could only be described as gun metal grey, begins nasty, gets nastier and then peaks with some glorious and bone crunching violence.Gibson is no Lee Marvin, but he puts into his performance of Porter all the mean and violent characterstics of Max Rocktansky and Martin Riggs. He doesn't shy away from violence, has not scruples hitting women and shooting men in the face and seems to gleefully revel in the blooshed and mayhem he creates. The script, written by Helgeland and Terry Hayes is polished and well constructed. The sparse, mean dialogue find a perfect bedfellow in Helgeland's staging of the action, it contains one of my favourite lines. When Lucy Lui's Pearl has beaten three shades of snot out of Val Resnick, she offers Porter a sexual favour by saying I've got three minutes to which Porter replies So go boil an egg. Priceless. Although slightly shorn of some of its violence by the BBFC on tape and DVD, the film packs a mighty wallop and deserves to be treated a little more reverence as opposed to what critics thought it to be, a typical throw-away Mel Gibson action movie.

To a criminal named Porter (played by Mel Gibson), it's worth everything.  The $70,000 is his share of a sweet little score, except his partners cheat him out of his share . . . and, well, try to kill him.  Unfortunately for them, they didn't succeed in killing Porter, and he wants his $70,000.  Now.`Payback' is a lot of slick, brutal action blended seamlessly with a tight, well-written script and a sense of dark, wry humor.  Porter, while not particularly a likeable character (he's about as apt to smile pleasantly at someone as he is to shoot someone in cold blood), is  certainly an interesting character.  What makes him so memorable is his single-mindedness -- he wants what he thinks he's owed (the $70,000) and he wants it from the partners who backstabbed him.  Other criminals offer Porter more money to stop his violent little manhunt for his former partners, but he doesn't want more money, he just wants HIS money, all $70,000 of it, no more, no less.  Porter's a pit bull set loose in a nursery school playground, and nobody in the world's going to stop Porter from getting what he wants.Because Porter's the `hero' of the movie -- in reality, he's just one bad guy pitted against a whole lot of other bad guys -- a lot of the typical action movie conventions are turned on their ear, making `Payback' unusual and original almost by default.  Characters that would normally be a supporting character or at least comic relief in a typical action movie are gunned down, shot, stabbed, or simply chased off at random moments during `Payback'.  Suspense builds throughout the film simply because after a while, you literally have no idea what to expect anymore.Mel Gibson is great as the ruthless Porter, but equally worthy of mention are William Devane's performance as Carter, a schmoozing two-bit crime boss, and Lucy Liu . . . yowza.  As a dominatrix named Pearl, she's hell on high heels in `Payback', and nearly as vicious as Porter.This movie definitely isn't for everyone.  The simple fact that there isn't a standard good guy does drag the film down to a certain extent.  Still, if you're in the mood for a clever, offbeat action film, then check out `Payback'.

Gibson is fantastic as the rugged underdog, as we see him in 'Maverick', 'Braveheart' and now 'The Patriot'.

Maria Bello is quite stunning and definately one to look out for in the future, as is Ally McBeal star Lucy Liu.  Both female performances are entertaining with Bello as the beautiful, innocent female lead and Liu as a sex bondage obsessive, who loves to inflict pain on men.

Gibson plays a professional thief back from the dead, betrayed by partner and wife and left with nothing but a clear idea as to where his life is to go next. Some seem to miss the point that Gibson's character Porter, doesn't really have a lot of choice in his life from this point on, there is more to him than a masochist simply bent on revenge. The film continues with Porter rebuilding his life, sorting out his friends and enemies and trying to take his money back, trying to start again.Porter is an excellent anti-hero, a well constructed character that is a fair rendition of the Richard Stark character, Parker, that he is based upon. Everything nasty from a chain smoking pickpocket and petty thief to essentially a murderer, we forgive him his sins because his behaviour is a matter of necessity, not choice, and because Porter demands a sense of sympathy due to his hard life. Gibson excels in this role, I would never have thought to cast him for this part, but watching the scene where he rescues Rosie from Val, we see he subtly displays Porter as something more than a man with a gun.For me the scenes around Porter and Rosie are some of the best of the film. The sub-plot around Porter's love life and relationships bring the film to more than just a thriller, although I am glad it was toned down and not over done. If you watch carefully, the scenes with Porter and Rosie are very different from the rest of the film, the style changes from tough, gritty thriller, with elements of black humour to something on a more complex and romantic level. I have heard that the performance by Maria Bello as the hooker with a heart is derivative and cliched, personally I don't think this is a bad thing. A cliche can be perfectly acceptable as long as it is carried off well, Maria is excellent in this role, but it is the seamless transition of mood and quality direction generally by Brian Helgeland, that sets these scenes apart.Humour features throughout in the corrupt detectives Hicks and Leary, a fetishist played by Lucy Liu (although I thought she was slightly mis-cast), the cleverly slimy but cowardly Val Resnick and wannabe crook, Stegman. Again this adds another welcome element to the film.On the whole in almost every aspect this film is well made, and I believe it is very much underrated as just another thriller. Strong themes and acting by Gibson, with excellent support from Maria Bello, make this one to look at again, even if Porter/Parker would never have got both the money, and the girl.

Sure, no one in this movie should be allowed to exist in the real world, but as for fiction, this is action-violence at it' s finest.Only Mel Gibson could take a despicable character like Porter and make us root for him, although a great supporting cast (playing characters even more despicable) certainly doesn't hurt.This movie has enough violence to make the Gestapo wince, so die-hard pacifists should beware.

Gibson's character, and in fact all of the characters in Payback, lack any redeeming qualities, and the film does not apologize for that.Gibson is Porter, a tough talking thug who, with the help of his drug addicted wife and his creepy friend, hijacks $140 000 from a band of mafia jockeys.  Later he is screwed out of his share when his wife and friend try to kill him.  Of course the plan is foiled and Porter is out for revenge. There isn't much I want to say about this movie, except that I found it rather dull.  The action moved along all right, but I cared so little for the characters (especially Gibson's) that kept losing interest.  There is lots of violence in this film, but none of it shocking and certainly none of it necessary.  I hate to say it but it seemed to me that the film makers were trying too hard.

Payback was not very violent (some people don't say so and I don't understand why) and the film was a huge focus on its extremely cool and various characters most of them played by BIG Hollywood names. The tagline says''Get ready to root for the bad guy''. I don't think it's right. Mel Gibson is playing a professional robber, but not really a bad and cruel guy. I guess they say bad guy because he's a robber...but he has feelings and he is funny. The story is EXTREMELY SIMPLE; a guy steals 14000 dollars and his associate(allied with Porter's wife) and the associate(which is one ofTHE BAD GUYS of the film)shoots Porter and thinks he is dead. And later, Porter steals a guy's wallet, buys a gun and goes back in town to get his money back(and kill his associate by the way). Like I said, Payback's good point is the characters, not the story. The scenario is cool and funny, and the atmosphere is creepy. I think this is a remake of the movie Point Blank, that was great too. Mel Gibson is'nt made to play a bad guy and it's pretty easy to see that. But, he is still a hero like another, but he has problems with police...a good movie, very entertaining. I give it 83%.

In Payback he plays an anti-hero character with few if any redeeming qualities. He starts out by robbing a helpless beggar, pick pockets a passerby and runs up a stolen credit card. He then goes on to cold-bloodedly murder an assortment of Syndicate mobsters. Is this our Mel? Say it isn't so.Mean Mel aside, Payback is not a bad action movie. The plot is basically the Gibson character's (Porter) quest to recover the $70,000 that he feels the Syndicate has stolen from him. It matters little that HE stole it in the first place. Incredible as the plot may be, the action scenes are very well done.(I mean. how does a solitary figure get to all of these well fortified and protected mobsters.) It is a very dark movie with no real sympathetic characters. You really have to be in the mood for this one.Aside from Gibson, the supporting cast is quite good. Gregg Henry (reminding one of a younger James Caan) plays Gibson's double crossing partner. Maria Bello as a heart of gold prostitute, is the only real friend that the Gibson character has (any wonder). David Paymer is good as a sleazy drug dealer looking to move up in the Syndicate. William Devane, James Coburn (appearing unbilled) and Kris Kristofferson play mobsters at the various level of the Syndicate organization chart that Gibson encounters along the way. Bill Duke and Jack Conley appear as a couple of crooked cops.Don't look for a hero in this movie. It never rises from the gutter. Even though you expect Gibson to suddenly become a good guy, he never does. It's hard to believe that Gibson could cause all of the explosions and damage and commit all of these murders with nary an honest cop in sight.Okay now that you've had your fun, give us our old Mel back.

What was also clever is how they started it you see a guy drinking some scotch, next thing you know the rest is spilled out, more is poured in, and puts (what looks like) surgical tools in it. Bullets are about to be removed from Porter (Gibson), a guy who just wants his money back.This film relied more on smarts than action. In all, there were about three action scenes in the whole movie (without any car chases ). Eventhough everyone in the movie was bad, they focus more on Gibson, who is the lesser of two evils. His partner, Val (Gregg Henry) is a sadomasochist, and never contributed to stealing this money (when they got it from the Chinese money launderers) in the first place. Low and behold, Val has a debt to pay to the syndicate, and the money Gibson robbed will not be enough to split evenly.

It was not, but after I got used to the violence instead of comedy, I found it enjoyable.There were some funny scenes in it, especially with that Asian dominatrix (who by the way was a hottie...)

Since I like dogs, the part where Rosie's dog gets shot made me uncomfortable.  There is also a character who gets off by beating up his women, which made me feel like jumping into the screen and killing him, but he gets his just desert.  If you can take the violence (comparable to Dirty Harry), it is a good, entertaining film.  The acting is good, especially in the quirks that Mel Gibson gives his character.

While this film wants to be tough and lively, PAYBACK does not contain the competence to be considered a class thriller.  The well-meaning cast tries earnestly and several of the performers portray their characters with aplomb, but a weak script and sodden pacing spoiled what could otherwise be a splendid film.Porter (Mel Gibson) is not your average nice guy.  In fact, he is a cold-blooded soul who does not put up with anybody.  He has a proclivity towards beating up his rivals without thinking twice.  Mister Porter is a career murderer who has made a number of hits.  As a hitman though, he is ticked off at this very moment...After embezzling $140,000 from a local street gang, Porter and his partner, Val (Gregg Henry, in a wonderfully sneaky role) are in the money.  Just when Porter is about to be financially secured, he then finds himself shot and left to die by his villainous double-crossing partner.  What chicanery! Val furtively escapes trouble...but when Porter wants his 70 grand share back, he will gain his money back!  Recovering from his bullet wounds, Porter has barely any time to recuperate.  Instead, he must give his regards to Val.A bad attitude, a bad reputation...  What else does he have to lose? Well, Porter is out to make the ultimate payback.PAYBACK is not the type of movie that people would expect Mel Gibson to star in.  Porter is also not the typical Mel Gibson role that the audiences have come to expect.  With that said, Mel Gibson did a bang-up job starring as the bad guy.  Gibson seems to have the time of his life as an antagonistic hero.  He shoots first, and makes deals later.  Trust me, you do not want to cross paths with this culprit!  One fact is for sure You will be rooting for the bad guy!  Even if he breaks all of the rules...Some of the other actors and actresses were great too.  Lucy Alexis Liu gives a killer performance as a pretty sadist who delivers pain for pleasure.  You also have to adore her outfit of pure S & M style!  Gregg Henry is deviously wily as the cheating ex-friend turned worst enemy. The roster of odd characters also add spice to this movie.  There are a pair of crooked cops (Bill Duke and Jack Conley), a nervous drug-dealer (David Paymer), and a street-wise friend of Porter's, Rosie (Maria Bello).Even though several of the performances were grimly on the money, sadly, I cannot say the same praises for actors Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn. Their considerable talents are rendered pointless in their nominal roles as a millionaire and a syndicate boss, respectively.PAYBACK has more drama than the typical shoot 'em up.  One interesting point about this movie is that it avoids the cliché ambivalence of a professional hitman and his self-consciousness.  Instead, this movie chooses to focus on a character who wants revenge just for two reasons the money, and to keep face.PAYBACK features lots of snappy one-liners, sassy characters, and a couple of nifty explosions.  Yet...it manages to still be kind of boring.  While PAYBACK is a nice change of pace for this actor, Mel Gibson, the film itself is not at all memorable.  PAYBACK wants to be dangerously entertaining, but it is more dangerously dull.  It is unfortunate that a slack pace can discourage viewers from maintaining interest in this movie.  PAYBACK is also not as sleek as the movie aspires to be.  This film also aspires to be a film noir type thriller, but it is neither provocative nor atmospheric. To add insult to injury, he action scenes were simply too phlegmatic.  The screenplay itself, though rife with scathing dark humor, never takes the time to fully develop its characters' personalities into entities that are even remotely captivating (save a few characters).This picture is also unrelentingly mean and dreadful at times.  PAYBACK is an immensely grim and dark movie, but it is not executed with a lot of flair.  It seems that everywhere throughout this movie, the darkest colors always have to predominate the backgrounds!  This film's prevalent gloominess is meant to give it mood, but instead of surrealism, we have tedium.  This movie is just so depressingly dark!In short, PAYBACK tries to be stylish and gritty, but there is not nearly enough insight and mood to keep this film intriguing.  It is not remarkably good I must warn you, but it is not atrociously bad either.  This film is made endurable thanks to Gibson's performance of pure callousness. Mediocre at best, let's just say that the attributes and foibles balance each other out...This film is not a disgrace.  In fact, I commend Mel Gibson for his portrayal as a criminal brute.  However, I personally do not think that this is Gibson's most suited role.  He should stick to being a fun-loving protagonist.  PAYBACK definitely was not the film that I hoped it would achieve.  The action scenes are shoddily directed and though there are a few breakthrough performances, PAYBACK is just not the prime thriller that it has so much destined to be.  If you like a morbid sense of humor, then by all means...RATING ** out of ****.

Furthermore, the plot and its characters seem torn between black comedy and the grit of the tough-guy action-drama.Characters played Cagney, Eastwood and Bronson were often made more appealing by inserting terse, clever lines of dialogue that managed to illicit chuckles while maintaining the character's persona. In Payback however, the humor is based around the complete buffoonery of every non-Gibson character in the movie, who follows each display of bumbling with a flat, predictable one-liner.Some of the more interesting characters in this movie such as Pearl and her asian mafia/triad/whatever group are never developed enough; other characters are developed more than necessary.And finally, Gibson himself brings nothing new to this role. Like any other film of his, he's beaten up repeatedly, yet manages to do more damage to everyone else. As a result there's little to no surprise, let a lone drama or even comedy, when Gibson gets himself into one mess after another.Gibson fans will likely enjoy this movie; undemanding viewers will find it watchable.

Payback has as much violence as any Mel Gibson movie, which is very much normal.This is the first Warner Bros. movie I've seen starring Mel Gibson, which doesn't involve director Richard Donner.

A mixture of action, drama, life and a lot of comedy. I laughed out loud in the movie, especially when the scene involved Val's japanese hooker getting hit by someone. The part which Mel set the Outfit's car on fire was also incredible and extremely funny.This is an excellent movie. Probably as good as any Lethal Weapon or even Conspiracy Theory.

When Porter awakes he is obviously annoyed and extremely determined to get his $70,000 back and is willing to go through extraordinary circumstances to get his money back.Payback stars Mel Gibson (who like John Travolta) is able to be a Hollywood big time face and still star in some good films in which he is very credible.Gibson had impressed me three times before this picture when he starred in 3 pretty good films Maverick,Ransom and The Man Without A Face. Not only were those suprisingly good films for Hollywood Blockbuster standards but Gibson was able to deliver three very good performances.This film's main story when you think about it is not an entirely original one as I have often seen the theme of a anti-hero looking to pay revenge to someone. This is the storyline used in a few Clint Eastwood and James Woods movies. Films like Cop are a good example of the revenge theme.But what Payback does and rather ingeniously is it is able to tell its unoriginal story in a way which to the untrained viewer seems very original and even to the suspecting viewer you are not disappointed as the new twists to an old theme are strong enough to make a good film.Payback does this by making the Gibson character the traditional anti-hero hero but only with a few new twists because this time the character is a lot more direct to the point e.g. when a gun is pointed at him because he knows this is probably just a threat he grabs it off him.There are many other great moments which reveal his character which I will not give away.The film also manages to be very humorous in a conventional way and a dark way getting most of its humour through violence.One of the films funniest character's is a Japanese hooker who is very much a sado mashocist and the way she plays the character is very amusing.The movie however does have a few problems which keep it from being a total success, such as just around the half way point there are a few cliched moments such as Gibson's relationship with an old girlfriend who happens to be a hooker with a heart of gold.Maria Bello is unable to bring any credibility to her character and because of this nearly every scene with her in it are very lame and do spoil the movie a tad.But despite a few weak scenes Payback is a very good film which succeeds through excellent humour and a fun original style which puts excellent twists to an old theme and it also features James Coburn in an amusing cameo.3/5  "},{"Title":"Another surprisingly good Mel Gibson film.","Date":"9 April 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Gibson has pretty much become typecast as the crazy guy who doesn't listen to authority and does things his own way.

Also, see the seventies Blaxploitation movie and especially the marvelous Coffy  and you call Payback nasty ? The twist was that everything wasn't to be taken seriously (compare it to 8 mm - noir with a self-righteous approach)  the humor works at different levels, and I would in a way compare it to a noirish Get Shorty. So the violence can't really be effective and, as some other user said judiciously, is on the level of a Tom & Jerry cartoon  everybody attacks Porter at the same time - twice in the movie !

Mel manages a 'reservoir dogs' type of casualness when he pulls out his shooters.There is a large dose of farce in the script. The bad guys persist in offering 130 grand even though Porter (played by Mel) only asks for 70. The chinese mafia appear as bungling fools. The sado-masochistic prostitute is plain silly.There is no social comment, little plot or mystery, no exploration of the character's nature, ie; no point to the movie. Though most of the humour worked well this was not a sufficient counterpoint to the high level of violence. I was entertained though because Porter is a rounded character with some redeeming features that allow you to care about him. Just.Only go to this movie if you are a regular and you like the style.

What bothered me about this film is that everybody seems so smart, but they do some very stupid things, like the bombers that let Porter blow up their car, for instance. Porter too can penetrate unarmed the inner sanctum of the gang boss, but lets himself be caught several times. Not very coherent, is it. Another detail that bothered me, because it seemed completely unnecessary, is the period setting. The action seems to happen around 1970 you see dial phones, a $2.98 bill at the bar, etc. All this is unnecessary, since that period makes no difference in the film, but keeps one distracted looking for anachronisms, instead of concentrating on the plot. Also, how much would those $70000 be worth today? Seventy grand in the thirties would let one retire comfortably; today they would be nice, but you would still need a job. How about the time when the film is supposed to happen? One gets no clear feeling about how much that money is really worth. Ho hum, if you are a big Gibson fan, or if you like thrillers, go see this film, but if you won't lose too much if you don't. I give it a six out of ten.

Small-time crook Porter (Mel Gibson) is in quite the pickle - after a heist of $140,000 from an Asian Mob, his partner Val (Gregg Henry) and wife (Deborah Kara Unger) shot him twice in the back and left him for dead. They did not plan, however, for him to recover afterward with the aid of a street corner doctor. Now, Porter is out for revenge and the sum of $70,000, his agreed payment in the robbery gone awry.Ahh, revenge can be a wonderful thing. And it is with Payback, a rather ingenious film-noir thriller that is sprinkled with tidbits of action, comedy and suspense. It's a loose remake of the 1967 movie Point Blank, starring Lee Marvin, which I have never seen. Nonetheless, I am quite sure that this updated version has more tricks up it's sleeve than it or any other thriller for quite some time.Director/co-writer Brian Helgeland has put somewhat of an Elmore Leonard-ish spin on his newest piece of work. There's hints of Reservoir Dogs, Out of Sight and other titles related to the Quentin Tarintino genre. Call it Pulp Fiction Lite -  you'll find it on the grocery shelf next to Spam. Fortunately, there are many agreeable twists that action fans are really going to enjoy, and Gibson supporters will be so utterly pleased with the film they will be calling him a saint. That is, if first they can get around the violence-level, which is rather high on the chart. But it really isn't as graphic as some critics have stated; the only real nose-turner is a torture scene involving a mini-sledgehammer that leaves most everything to your imagination.> There's  much for Porter to contend with, including the Asian mob lead by Ally McBeal's Lucy Lui, who is humorous in her black-leather role. The movie also gives Gibson his best role since Braveheart, supplying him with many funny one-liners and hinting marvelously at his suicidal Martin Riggs' character in the original Lethal Weapon. Surrounded by past stars having a lot of fun, Gibson brings some kind of endearing charm to his murderous bad guy, one that makes Payback all the more enjoyable.

Based on the book  The Hunter , that was already filmed by John Boorman, with Lee Marvin, Payback  follows the original plot with fidelity in certain moments, but when it reaches the end, it strays completely of the premise of the book.  Payback  was very criticized and it divided the opinions.

Payback is one of those movies that has you wondering about the character with the unsavoury laugh on the other side of the cinema. You really would expect that person to take to someone with a hammer at some stage of their life!That's not to say that I didn't enjoy some of Payback. Mel Gibson gives the film plenty of interest and the tension is pretty much continuous. The supporting cast is memorable, it's just that the overall tone joins heartlessness with blood letting in a particularly jaded way.Payback is the sort of film that has you questioning the morality of the latter day American culture. There's no warmth there at all. This is no Pulp Fiction or Lethal Weapon where at least some of the characters are punks with heart. This lot have less moral strength than your average car jack.I'm no wowser I think, but Payback is particularly grey. There are some fun moments, especially when Porter, the Mel Gibson character, meets a particularly mean dog, but the humour of that situation is the comparison that's offered between Porter and the dog. And the dog is just as mean as Porter is a real scumbag. If you're worried about the way our citizens are developing then Payback won't soften your fears.We've got used to no brainer action (read violent) movies and there have been magnificent gangster films made that have been sporadically vicious (The Godfather films, Scarface, Casino etc) but at least the main characters were on some sort of quest, even if it was just to keep control. In Payback though, the violence is nearly non stop and the motive nearly meaningless.Of course you're meant to not take this sort of mayhem too seriously, but Payback passes beyond the self mocking anti-hero genre way so far into the realm of sadism and masochism that I think that you'd be better off seeing films that aren't so bleak.Mel Gibson fans will see shades of Riggs out of Lethal Weapon but I hope they won't like Porter and I hope for all of our sakes that not too many of our fellow citizens enjoy this film too much.

He is an antihero, a violent, amoral traveller in a seedy underworld of crooks and gangsters who are many times stronger and better armed than he is, but generally lack his cunning and seriously underestimate his determination to get what he feels he is owed.Most people don't know what they're worth, says Porter in a voiceover as the movie opens.  I know exactly what I'm worth.  $70,000.  That's what they took from me, and that's what I'm going to get back.Porter is hardened and bloodsoaked, and merciless in the way he deals with his enemies.  But he has an irresistable charm, a way of putting a positive spin on the fact that that bloodstain on your carpet just couldn't be avoided.The gangsters range from high-level G-men to lowly thugs and crooked cops, but all of them are colorful and interesting.  There is the love interest, named Rose, a call girl who naturally is good and kind underneath her exterior.  James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson do a nice turn as high-level members of the crime scene, and there is an Asian woman, who has some seriously twisted turn-ons.Did I enjoy it?  I did, but I admired it more for its style than its substance.  I had seen it all before, but Gibson brings a resonance to his role that few actors could have pulled off, and I have to admit that I was sucked into his character's bizarre world, and came out with a silly grin on my face.

Here is a man living by his wits and deadly skills in a seedy and occasionally dumb criminal world.  It is the bad hero's intelligence that gives him his greatest advantage over the badder guys unpredictability.There's only brief but potent character development played out between Porter and his love interest, but even the static bad guys are mostly interesting.  The mobsters are essentially played straight.  It's the betrayers, crooked cops, and dominatrix who add the spice and stir the pot.The setting appears to be 70's retro, perhaps when the novel it's based on was written or the period the screenwriters felt it could fit.  We can guess from Porter's USMC tatoo that he's perhaps a Vietnam War vet or ex-spook who's settled into a comfortable, relatively modest life of violent crime.  I know and have worked with several Vietnam vets, none criminals and all honorable, but Mel's clever character and Payback's engrossing effect had me wondering how he could have acquired his skills.Frankly I'm getting tired of most movie violence.  Even Tarantino doesn't really do it for me.  Payback has a flaw or two, but it's so well crafted that I found myself enjoying it out loud... in a sick, twisted way.8 out of 10.

While admittedly a work of fiction, Payback shows us more of the real world than the average Hollywood flick.  In the real world, there are few instances where this guy is good, and this guy is bad.  Gibson in Payback is a villain, to be sure.  Not the first guy you'd want to send a Valentine to. But in the shades of gray painted in this gritty, underground crime world, is Mel better or worse than the Big Crime bosses he pursues?  I really don't think the question is relevant.  We root for the bad guy, Mel, because he's the guy telling the story.  It's all in the slant you view the film on. Payback is harsh, violent, and filmed in a manner that makes it feel, overall, like a noir detective movie.  But it also is a movie that is not afraid to let us know exactly what we could find in the real world, if we wanted to look.  Take, for instance, the family man/crime boss played by Kris Kristofferson.  Is his family aware of his dealings in organized crime?I don't believe Payback can be discounted as trash, or labeled as a contributing factor in the sorry state of our world.  It is not the aim of the filmmakers to corrupt moviegoers or instill the idea of a life of crime. There is no gloss or glorification of what Mel, or any of the other actors do to advance the plot.Simply put, Payback is a terrific film that isn't afraid to show the viewers everything, and to that I give it great credit.  It's not Mel Gibson or anyone else associated with this film that need to worry about corrupting young children.  It's the parents dumb enough to take their children along.***1/2  "},{"Title":"They crushed his piggies!","Date":"18 February 1999","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  Oh boy!

This is a violent film, with a lot of amoral characters and amoral attitudes toward things. When people in the audience laugh at scenes of killing and sexual depravity, it sometimes bothers me, but I think the screenplay is designed to elicit these sorts of responses.This movie was based on the same crime novel that inspired John Boorman's _Point Blank_, with Lee Marvin in the role that Mel Gibson plays now. Boorman's film is much better, in so many ways, not the least the fact that the amoral violence would carry more of a kick in the late 60s.  Now, it's nothing we haven't seen before, in the latest Tarantino-wannabe's latest creation.Don't get me wrong--I'm not condemning the film.

Gibson is always in control, from the moment he steps onto the screen, to the point where he is tied up to a chair.

So a point-by-point comparison is in order 1.  The plots of both films are virtually the same.  The new film adds an Asian gang but drops the Keenam Wynn character that was so essential to Point Blank. 2.  Both films make good use of character actors, but Point Blank contains a wonderful performance by a pre-Archie Bunker Carroll O'Connor that adds nuances to a syndicate leader character the new film can't even imagine.  On the other hand, Debra Karra Unger, Maria Bello, and Greg Henry are better actors than their counterparts in Point Blank. 3.  Brian Helgeland's direction of Payback is flat and uninspired.  A recent article in Premiere indicated that Mel Gibson took the film away from him and had it re-edited.  For good reason.  Boorman, on the other hand, created a truly original movie.  His movement between past and present is confusing at times, but the film always holds your attention.  And he makes the most out of the least amount of dialog. 4.  Gibson himself is the problem with the film.  He is simply no match for Lee Marvin as the loner obsessed with getting his money back.  To quote Stephen Hunter in his review of the movie in the Washington Post, Marvin had cool--a deep reserve of masculine confidence into which the camera can tap only if it's there.  Gibson?  As if.

Payback follows Porter, a professional robber who is stitched up by his friend and shot by his wife after a heist and they make a big mistake. He survives and goes after his share of the money from the robbery. A simple revenge plot that goes along way and then some. With a fantastic set of characters from crooked cops to the Mafia, Payback has everything. Mel Gibson is again in top form and I feel that this is one of his best roles since the Lethal Weapon series.The overall feel of the film is quite dark with a little touch of noir to make it feel like an old 70's film which does work really well and does seem to fit with the story.Its very cool and packs a punch with a hard hitting finale.

Then, when The D.C. of the film came out, I watched it and it made more sense.First of all, there is more character development, the beginning is shorter as you don't see porter getting bullets removed from his back, other scenes were shortened to make the movie flow a little better. but the biggest change was both the ending (which is totally different) and the Bronson character who you don't see and was originally a woman (voiced by Sally Kellerman) which changes the tone of the ending as you wonder if you will ever see her or if she chooses to have faith in her people to eliminate Porter.All in all, a well-made film.

Or if they're feeling really reckless, have him commit some actual crime, like hit someone when he's not supposed to. But it's all token stuff that no one would really bat an eye at in a movie, so in the end it comes off as looking like a poser. That doesn't happen here.The trailers make this out to be like another Mel Gibson movie; light, jokey and harmlessly mischievous. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a dark, brutal and violent movie. Not for the faint hearted.This is a noir/revenge movie. Porter (Mel Gibson) is a low rent criminal whose wife (Debra Kara Unger) and partner, Val (Gregg Henry) betray him and steal his 70 grand from a score that the three of them took down. But Porter isn't dead, and he wants his money.Payback is actually two movies rolled into one. The first half is a film noir, but unfortunately it's pretty bad. It's painfully slow, and the acting is embarrassing. Everyone just grumbles hammily, and no one seems comfortable in this kind of movie. The worst offenders are Gibson and William Devane, who plays one of the crime bosses. Devane is especially bad, if only because he was so creepy in Marathon Man. It's not until the second half when the film finds its groove and becomes a full blown revenge movie. That's when it really takes off. Unfortunately it takes the better part of an hour to get there, and the movie is only 100 minutes.Apart from Gibson and Devane, the acting is solid, but unspectacular. They do more or less what they are expected to. Special mention however has to go to Maria Bello and James Coburn. Bello is terrific; she's the lone ray of sunshine in the midst of crooks, psychos and endless violence. We can really feel for her, and she has great chemistry with Gibson. James Coburn is actually quite funny, something that's in very short supply in this world. Sadly he's only in three scenes. David Paymer, who is usually very reliable, is pretty annoying, and Lucy Liu is more over-the-top than she should be as a dominatrix.Oscar-winning screenwriter Brian Helgeland has a knack for atmosphere, but not pacing. The first half of the movie is so long and dull that it threatened to put me to sleep. And despite the fact that the second part of the movie watchable, it's not good enough to justify watching it.My rating Rated R for Pervasive Strong Brutal Violence and Language.

The slightly-unhinged character of Porter always retains a likable hint of playfulness that is something at odds to what one might expect. There are also believability problems with the logic of such a cold, hard-nosed character. After all; he was primarily a thief, not an assassin. And many of his comments both during the narration and dialogue suggest a much more pragmatic turn of thought than his nihilistic attitude towards the mob for just $70,000. A man with his common sense would surely have just bumped-off his double-crossing wife and partner and set about another heist. Crossing-up an organised crime syndicate for such a piddling sum hinted at psychosis.Nevertheless, the plot was constantly - even relentlessly - driven, with interesting and unexpected little twists along the way. You never quite knew what the outcome would be. I found that the pace of plot and severity of violence on first showing tended to mask what proved to be on second-sight, a very dark comedy. It would be better judged as the latter, after the fashion of - say - 'Fargo'.There are excellent supporting turns throughout, mixed with some rather implausible touches. James Coburn gets a look-in, and he never disappoints. The monochrome presentation lends it a film-noir style, but the lack of subtlety in lighting and camera work prevent it from making the grade. Nicely done, even so; the lack of colour doesn't detract from viewing pleasure. Quite the contrary; it makes the comedy all the more dark.Well worth a watch. Especially, watch it a second time after some weeks.

Mel Gibson takes the main role this time around and delivers an enjoyably mean performance as a ruthlessly single-minded anti-hero. Payback had a rather chequered production history, and it is somewhat surprising that the finished article emerges as stylish and well-made as it does. Generally-speaking, though, this is a film with plenty going for it.Tough crook Porter (Mel Gibson), aided by his wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) and partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry), steals money from a Chinese Triad gang. Later, Porter is betrayed by his accomplices &#150; his wife shoots him in the back, and she and Resnick take off with the loot. Porter survives the shooting and some while later returns to the streets of Chicago to get back his money. He doesn't want revenge, he doesn't even want the entire sum from the robbery &#150; just his half of the heist, a seemingly paltry $70,000. Having tracked down Resnick, Porter learns that his former partner-in-crime has used the money to pay his way into a crime organisation called the Outfit. Resnck claims that he can't get the cash back, so with methodical ruthlessness Porter works his way up the criminal food chain in his quest to retrieve his money. First on the list is crime lord Carter (William Devane); later the urbane Fairfax (James Coburn); eventually the stakes get so high that the head honcho Bronson (Kris Kristofferson) has to get involved. Porter is hunted by enemies on all sides &#150; and can only trust his loyal hooker friend Rosie (Maria Bello) &#150; as he closes in on his seventy grand.It's wonderfully ironic how any of the crime lords that Porter comes across during the movie could pay him his money with ease. At one point, Fairfax guffaws in disbelief that Porter could possibly be going to such lengths for such a small amount of money &#150; Seventy grand! he scoffs. Hell, my suits cost more than that! The character of Porter is a thief with his own moral code &#150; what he steals becomes his, and he intends to collect whatever is due him! The film is shot through in bleached colour, giving it a grey and grainy appearance reminiscent of the hard-boiled crime capers of the 60s and 70s. It's an effective and atmospheric touch. Parts of the film are slightly too-stylized and damage the gritty tone &#150; most of the sequences featuring Lucy Liu and her Triad buddies, for example. But there are other moments that are judged very well indeed. Porter's brief and brutal meeting with Carter; the original robbery of the money from the Triad; an electrifying torture scene during which Porter has his toes mutilated by a hammer-wielding lackey; and the explosive ending during which our anti-hero turns the tables on his adversaries from a seemingly hopeless situation. While not perfect by any means, Payback is a solid thriller that delivers the goods. It also marks a welcome switch from the occasional sentimentality that can be found in some of Gibson's 90s films back to the raw, unapologetic style of his Mad Max movies. "},{"Title":"One of the most memorable scripts ever!","Date":"3 January 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" A lot of movies have great scripts. But most of those films turn out to be filled with underlying meaning, deep emotional moments, and compassionate characters. Payback doesn't have any of these, but Brian Helgeland's script is so smooth and cool that it flows like poetry. Movies like Deer Hunter and A Clockwork Orange are brilliant works, but due to Payback's style alone, they are left in the dust by this seemingly simple tale of revenge.It opens with a wounded man named Porter (Mel Gibson). Like any film noir, Porter narrates throughout the journey. We later discover that in one of his heist jobs, he is betrayed by his wife and partner, Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). Resnick wanted to establish himself back in the New York, and the only way he could get the money was to betray Porter. Porter lives, and after his recovery, discovers he is truly alone in the world. He has no family, his wife's a druggy and dies of a overdose, and his partner Val has betrayed him. The only thing he has left is the $70,000 stolen by his partner, and a hooker lover named Rosie (Maria Bello).In most action movies, like this, the bad ass character is superficial, he is an unstoppable killing machine that always has some witty one liner. Payback doesn't take that route. As he tracks down members of the syndicate to get his money back, he is hit by a car, taken advantage of by crooked cops, and severely tortured. Doesn't necessarily sound like something that would happen to an unstoppable killing machine? He does have witty one liners, but they're realistic. There's one scene in particular where we see the masochist-sadist relationship of Pearl (Lucy Liu) and Val. Pearl's slamming on him in all kinds of ways while Porter is simply watching. After Val gets knocked out by all the abuse, Lucy Liu comments I have a few minutes (meaning she's willing to give some horizontal refreshment to Porter) and Porter replies, So go boil an egg! Now that's a cool line, and it comes out natural and not.... well, hollywoodized.I loved the syndicate villains as well. They were provided with the same character treatment as Porter. They're lines were a little campier (hey, they're villains, what do you expect?), but they weren't evil henchmen who went Muhaha! They were typical businessmen who didn't want to give up the $70,000 dollars. But to put you on Porter's side, Brian Helgeland puts a few undesirable traits in his villains. Val Resnick is a beater of women automatically demonizing him. Carter (William Devane), who is Val's boss, sympathizes with him, automatically making Carter just as evil. My hatred for the character of Bronson (Kris Kristofferson), the big boss, barely succeeded. He is a stubborn asshole who just doesn't want to give up $70,000 dollars to a guy that's been giving him trouble. The scene where he starts hammering on Porter's toes to get information out of him is the scene that changes your feelings toward the man. We see Porter crying out in agony and Bronson with a smug look on his face. That disturbing scene is what wins the audience over to Porter's side.The action is gripping, the pacing is fantastic, and the lines are classic. There's nothing more to be asked for an action film like this. Payback is close to being my favorite film and for good measure too. It is truly one of the best revenge films ever made, and if you have not seen it, I seriously suggest you do.A+ "},{"Title":"Payback is the ultimate action-drama movie of the year!","Date":"3 January 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Wow, who would've thought Mel Gibson would do better in a movie than he did in Braveheart, well the fans who saw Payback would've.

Thanks to Mel Gibson's abiding fascination with pain and madness his character Porter is enormous guilty fun. Near the beginning he is appropriately betrayed as an Ex marine by a tattoo which is shown prominently but never referenced. Over and over again he lives up to this image by showing the mental patient cleverness and incredible tolerance for pain that so often marks Gibson's characters. Porter comes back from the 'mostly dead' seek a violent, life-devaluing, but very funny revenge. Stellar performances from Maria Bello (who hopefully is still alive and in the business...somewhere), Lucy Lu (I'm serious), and a host of excellent bit-villains played by great color actors make this one of the best guy flicks since the death of the '80's.

Of course, he didn't die but he was badly injured alright and at least he looks so and not like some superman. He then set to get his share of the money and along the way, he met all sorts of thugs and bad cops. So what is worth watching then? Acting was good, really. There's humor as well as touch-guy acts. And there was some twist at the end. And the camera angle as well as the cinematography was just perfect for a mafia-like movie like this. In terms of fim-making perspective, there is nothing bad about this movie at all, bar the plot. Although trying to get yourself seriously hurt and obvious death for 70K may sound a little too stupid, that what makes it fun to watch, with Porter repeating countlessly that he IS asking for only hist 70K and nothing more.

Then he got Mel Gibson on as the lead, and it all went downhill from there.  It's not that I don't like Mel, I love the Lethal Weapon series, he just screwed this movie up too much.  Gibson, it seems, is too worried about his hollywood image as a cream puff tough guy.  So instead of actually portraying the character of the book, Gibson decides to have a romantic interlude and crack jokes.

This is his Rubicon there will be no turning back.Porter (Mel Gibson) is a man who, when his wife dies, has lost everything. He has his own moral code and pursues an outstanding debt with the single-mindedness of someone with Asperger's Syndrome. He is violent in pursuit of his goal, but not gratuitously so, not within the context of this particular world, where crime and violence are everywhere and pleasure is sought in the context of deliberately inflicted pain. Body count 18. The pivotal character in Porter's life is a former employer, Rosie (Maria Bello), a prostitute. Her friendship has to be in question now, given she works for the gangsters who have Porter's money. This is a story about the unbending of a proud, stubborn man. The fact Porter is willing to ask Rosie for help represents a major change for him, and provides a basis for the eventual 'happy ending', such as it is.Meanwhile the bad guys get theirs in various and appropriate ways. Traps are circumvented, the powerful bested, the cunning wrapped up inside their own puzzles, and the corrupt caught in a web which, even if they didn't exactly weave it themselves, they have every moral right to find themselves inside.Mel Gibson's famous smile is only on view twice in the movie, first time when he struggles to mimic the smiling face of someone whose identity he is about to borrow, and once for real at the end, when he is about to sail off into the sunset with the girl and the money.The supporting actors are excellent. The double-crossing ex-partner Val Resnick (Gregg Henry), the junkie wife (Deborah Kara Unger), Rosie (Maria Bello), dominatrix Pearl (Lucy Liu), gang bosses Bronson (Kris Kristofferson) and Fairfax (James Coburn) stand out.My only quibbles about the film are (1) the way Carter dies. (I've been shot! Hold dramatic pose. Make short speech. Move into another dramatic pose. Hold.) It's not quite Peter Sellers in THE PARTY (1968), but it's a borderline pantomime performance. And (2), the almost total absence of people from the streets of what must be a very large city. At certain moments it feels like a ghost story. But not for long. There's always another bit of action coming that will distract you from these minor quibbles.An A-grade heist film. Highly recommended.

The unusual concept of Mel Gibson as a villain/good-guy got the movie stuck in my head. I researched into it on IMDb and added the DC version to my 'need to watch' movie list. I figured I'd be in for an experience that bends the usual revenge scenario.The movie opens at a slow pace and puts you in the middle of the story. Alright, this isn't a bad way of placing suspense with the audience. Problem is that with a plot like this, it feels way too cut/copy/paste from Reservoir Dogs. While this popped in my head it didn't take away from anything, I continued to watch. I then watch a scene where the super-cool typical 90's style character Porter has a scene with a woman that wronged him. I over exaggerate bit. I begin to notice that Porter has too many character stereotypes that make this movie feel unrealistic and take away from it's supposed gritty tone. I sometimes think I'm watching Sargeant Briggs.This is a revenge movie, and the reason for this revenge rampage is sufficient enough to make you care about Porter's forthcoming adventure. After this reason, the plot falls very hard. There are two bad guys that are overly annoying and geeky (the kind that don't actually work in the mob). I see this as a cheap was of getting the audience involved in wanting a brutal killing that does get delivered. The original bad guy is dealt with half way through the movie which leaves the second half feeling a tad unguided. This doesn't default as a bad thing but Porter's goals are no longer about revenge at this point. Porter can't be considered 100% bad-guy because he kind of deserves the money he seeks. I feel like this fact is hidden while the movie is promoted for 'rooting for the bad guy'. I do give credit for being one of the only movies like this, but there's no teeter-totter argument with Porter being good or bad. He is a criminal, but keeps earning our sympathy so his bad deeds feel justified.Interestingly, he isn't the guns blazing psycho type. He deals with the bad guys by taking advantage of every impassibly tiny vulnerability. And each big crime boss only has two dumb body guards.There is an obvious plot device that saves this movie from being complete generic trash Porter kills people in cold blood. The premise that hooked me into watching this movie was delivered successfully. This made the film entertaining in-spite of the lacking aesthetic value. Lucy Lui shows up being sexy as always, playing a sadist prostitute. While being top-notch sex appeal, she does nothing for the plot. Another scene to note is the van gun fight against the Asian gang. This was scripted well and stood out as being unique. The ending is unimportant. By the time it was over I wasn't sure what I just watched. i didn't learn anything. The movie tries to throw a fresh spin on a typical 90's crime movie. While it succeeds at some points, the lame plot ruins the idea. It feels like someone tried to cover up a cooker cutter movie with an original concept. In the end it feels like a half hearted attempt that doesn't live up to the hype and i feel let down. I now understand why this movie isn't more popular than it is.

(in the series of Dirty Harry) After I watched Payback. I think it had both of good and bad things in the movie which I will type later. However, I accepted that I have never seen The Straight Up version which was purely directed and edited by Brian Heldgeland (I have a chance only to see the information and how the Straight Up version was different from this version in 1999), so I will comment Payback without the feeling from Straight Up's information. (Cause I didn't watch Straight Up)First thing that I have to say, Payback intruded womens right many times. I saw the scene that women was punched or slapped many times which could not see in the ordinary movie. (Usually the women in general movie was slapped for once or twice during the fight or when they try to lash into the men.) Maybe it was the intention of Brian Heldgeland to make this movie more crude and sensual; However, it was very unnecessary to use that kind of scene in the movie. OK it could be fine during Pearl and Val scene and also Val and Rosie scene because it was reasonable, but in the scene that Pearl was punched by a big fat guy. (I didn't know his name but I know he is Fairfax's henchmen) Even it looked like a joke but it looked silly and needless. Could you do in the different way? For next, even Payback trespass on the womens right like I said but the action scene and the cast is very good. You could see some satisfy action like the explosion or the cold-blooded killing which is the strength of this film. Also the cast like Mel Gibson who showed everyone that he is one of the Hollywood's legend. Gregg Henry who could made himself like the son of b*h, his villain role could be considered as the one of the most heinous villain in the world of Hollywood. Lucy Liu also great in this film, even she had this role before she got her peak in Charlie's Angel; However, she could entertain everyone with her vehement action, especially in the scene with Val. Finally, I try to conclude my comment. This film has both of good and bad things. It was very good in a very satisfy and extreme action scene also the entertaining cast. However, due to this was the film-noir style and Brian Heldgeland try to make this movie dark and crude, so many thing in the movie was very bad liked the women's beating.

The specialized press liked the cleansing vibe which revived this thriller as well as its stylish aesthetic side. I'm not conducive at all to these assets and it seems that we didn't watch the same movie. I only saw a derivative story that piled up well-worn ingredients revolving around a story of revenge with an obstinate, unscrupulous killer, Porter (Mel Gibson) who wants to have his cash back and is confronted to a gallery of stereotyped characters including a sadomasochistic mistress, ruthless business men, baddies and members of the underworld.Brian Helgeland searched this way and that (Quentin Tarantino's universe, the Dirty Harry saga, many gangster movies) to bestow his film with a semblance of substance. But his scenario can't hold up because it seems to have been written in a snap manner and it's too linear to be really excited about it in spite of the unexpected twists and turns to beef it up. Anyway, some of these turns aren't that much fresh. His directing also accumulates free violence with many fights, scraps, explosions thrown in for good measure and to give substance to a skimpy, ramshackle set. But beyond the endeavor to give a stylish film which makes it look like a comic strip, there's really nothing exciting.Mel Gibson acts like a dogged zombie and gets the lion's share in the cast. He was at odds with Helgeland and reorganized several moments as well as he supervised the editing. He beat a dead horse for it doesn't improve the quality of the film.

But this is strictly a B movie with not much to offer. David Paymer was sufficiently oily as Stegman, but Kris Kristofferson appeared to phone in his performance, which was, of course, hampered by a lame script. William Devane appeared to relish his performance as a mob boss, but he certainly was no Tony Soprano. In other words, there was no subtlety of character. And, ultimately, that's the problem with this flick. There are some fine actors in the movie (and one wonders why, other than simply the money, they agreed to make it).

And he's prepared to start killing off Syndicate Thugs one by one, working his way up the food chain until he gets to boss Kris Krisopherson. If only they would part with their petty $70, 000! Shot and narrated in a very pulpy style, Payback almost seems like a gritty 1970s revenge thriller. But it doesn't seem to go all the way and injects humor into the proceedings, which contrasts with the genre. The humor is entertaining and works as a breather between the action scenes, but it would have been a better and more original film if it was tough all the way through.I guess that the producers wanted Payback to be more of a Lethal Weapon movie rather than an homage to Point Blank or Death Wish.

The violence is only slightly leavened with a series of nasty one-liners and a bit of sardonic humor, which I understand Gibson imposed on the film.

However Porter is double crossed, shot and left for dead. He recovers to find Resnick had used the money to settle his debts and join 'the organisation'. Porter sets out to kill Resnick and retrieve his share of the money ($70,000) from the organisation.This basically wants to be a 1970's thriller. The gritty film stock with washed out colours, the jazz soundtrack, the tough anti-hero etc. It does pretty well for most of it and manages to stay interesting. Porter goes about his duty and eventually finds himself at war with the whole mob for only $70K! The implausibility of this is tempered by the film's sense of humour and clever(ish) twists. Bits of it are just overly nasty for the sake of it, mainly to make Porter seem even nastier. However other bits are clearly cleaned up to ensure that the audience isn't upset - such as the dog who is clearly shot dead in the head (only to have a bandage on it's stomach in the next scene!) or the happy ending.Gibson does OK, but it's obvious he wants to be tough and vicious without being unlikable. In Point Blank, Lee Marvin didn't worry about being loved by the audience. But that's the down side of star-power, you always got to look good. Henry is good as Resnick as he doesn't have to worry about people going to see his next movie - he's able to be tough and vicious without remorse. Bello's Rosie is a bit vapid and is unnecessary love interest. The main strength is in the organisation's bosses - Devane, Kristofferson and James Coburn. Quality in spades - even if they're not taking it too seriously. Finally Lucy Liu has fun as a sexy dominatrix.Overall it wants to be a tough 1970's thriller but it also wants to let Gibson end it as a star without alienating the audience. Entertaining even if it is flawed.

Westlake's novel The Hunter. Mel Gibson plays tough as nails thief Porter, who is double crossed, shot, and then left for dead by his wife Lynn (Deborah Kara Unger) and his partner in crime Val Resnick (Gregg Henry). We are then taken on a dark journey as Porter sets out to reclaim the $70.000 that he was shot and almost killed for. He wants no more, no less than what he is owed, and he literally will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. Including taking on the Chicago mob organisation known as The Outfit. Payback is a mean and violent movie, it is unrelenting in its willingness to keep nastiness at the top of the story. The film is full of flawed and vile people, even Porter himself, the closest we have to a (anti) hero has badness coursing through his veins, he is a dislikable killer, the film is about exactly what the tag-line suggests, Get Ready To Root For The Bad Guy! As Porter trawls through this part of Chicago, he will come across bent coppers, drug pushers/addicts/runners, Asian gangsters, prostitutes, violence fetishists and the slimy chain of command of the Chicago mob. Nobody here is about to cheer you up. The style of the film owes its being to classic film noir and the 1970s hard crime movies led by Dirty Harry and Death Wish. The makers had originally wanted to film it in black and white, but instead went for a de-saturation technique, a bleach by-pass process that really puts a grim grey and blue sheen on the visuals. The thumping score is tonally correct, while a good sound track also helps (always nice to see hear Voodoo Chile), and the use of voice over narration by Porter evokes the classic noir period and works a treat because it's not over done. The film strongly relies on Mel Gibson to bring menace and a measure of sympathy to the vengeful Porter, and it is with much credit that he manages to achieve both these things skilfully. He is backed by a strong support cast, Maria Bello admirable in her big shift from TV to film - Lucy Liu hilarious and stunningly sexy as a dominatrix and Gregg Henry is just wild. The Outfit chain of command features William Devane, James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson, all slick and welcome additions, even if they are all under used; though this is more by narrative necessity than film making decisions. Bill Duke, David Paymer and Jack Conley fill out the impressive roll call of scum-bags. Violent, laconic and darkly comic as well, Payback is one of the best remakes around, a neo-noir essential in fact. 8.5/10 Footnote Director Helgeland released his own Directors Cut in 2006. Unhappy with the original version, he changed some of the structure and visual style and made it shorter by ten minutes. It's inferior to the 100 minute original cut in my opinion, losing much of the noir stylisations, but the last quarter is different and will (does) certainly appeal to others.

All three are based on The Hunter, a 1962 novel by Donald Westlake. Hunter's novel was also adapted by Ringo Lam in 1992. Titled Full Contact, this version of the tale is an ultra violent Hong Kong actionerPoint Blank stars Lee Marvin as Walker, a thief who's shot and left for dead by his associates. What follows is a revenge plot in which Walker rabidly pursues both vengeance and the money he is owned. The film makes all the usual noir stops &#x96; informants, mob bosses, snitches, ex lovers, bars and bar-room brawls &#x96; before climaxing with our cast assembling around a much desired case of money.Marvin plays Walker as a force of nature, a relentless, violent, no-nonsense man. He says little and is supremely fixated on pay back. Broad-shouldered and unblinking, Marvin moves like a machine, inexorably closing in on his target. The film was directed by John Boorman, a director whose films tend not to age well.Point Blank's predecessor is Fritz Lang's The Big Heat, another film which found a macho man hell-bent on revenge. Coincidentally, Lee Marvin played a bit part in Lang's film as well; a low level mobster with a fondness for beating up women. Point Blank also resembles Melville's Le Samourai, a much better film released that same year.Upon release Point Blank was well received. Marvin took violent, macho stoicism to new heights, the film was shockingly violent and its use of several experimental, avant-garde techniques (elliptical editing, fractured time lines, abrupt, shockingly callous violence, discordant sounds, flashbacks etc) was deemed novel. The film's somewhat odd narrative structure stands out even today. It unfolds as the jagged dreams of a bleeding man, a criminal betrayed even by his dying fantasies. Forever cut off from the money he futilely chases, Walker is perpetually trapped in the mind-space of Alcatraz, always reaching, walking or lunging for that case of green he so manically desires.Actor Mel Gibson released a remake of Point Blank in 1999. Titled Pay Back, Gibson's film amps up the sadism, audacity, violence, relentlessness, sexism and macho determination of Boorman's film. In customary Gibson fashion, Gibson spends most of the film bleeding, battered or tied to a chair whilst being tortured. Gibson's sadistic streak and love for flagellation are given a self-conscious tinge, though, as the film has a comical subplot involving an S and M dominatrix.Regardless, Gibson's character, who makes Marvin's look like a wimp, is so determined to reclaim his money that he systematically works his way to the top of a massive criminal organisation, effortlessly knocking kingpins and mob bosses off one by one in an attempt to find someone man enough to pay him the cash he's owed. Because such films rely on the shock of transgressive violence, and because such cinematic shocks are always exponentially increasing or intensifying, Boorman's Point Blank looks positively tame and pointless today. Marvin knocks off some crooked cops and hoodlums, Gibson climbs a criminal empire. Pay Back was so knowingly, ridiculously extreme in 1999 that even today it packs a punch.Note that Pay Back exists in two cuts. Director Brian Helgeland produced a cut which was deemed dull and dour by Gibson. Gibson thus stepped in, altered the script, removed some scenes (ironic, a domestic abuser removing a wife beating scene), added a noir narrator and had much of the film re-shot, re-scored and colour-graded. Gibson then released his edited version in cinemas as the theatrical cut. Always a populist, Gibson's version sucked in the blood-hungry crowds. This theatrical cut is a violent, comic-book neo-noir which amps up its carnage and comedy. It doesn't take itself seriously and revels in its pulpy ridiculousness. Helgeland's director's cut, assembled years later but hampered because much of the footage necessary for such an assembly was lost or missing, in contrast plays like a straight, 1960s crime movie. Few director's cuts are so radically different from their theatrical releases. In any case, Gibson's theatrical cut, because its relatively unique in tone, is superior. Helgeland's cut too strongly echoes tamer crime dramas of the 60s.8/10 - Worth one viewing.

Porter (Mel Gibson) was betrayed, shot, and left for dead, only to come back from the dead for payback. Just like most typical revenge driven movies, Porter has to work his way to the top of the criminal food chain to get complete closure. Payback puts an interesting spin on the vengeance game; instead of Porter seeking justice for his own attempted murder, he simply wants the money that was stolen from him by the guy who tried to kill him. It makes for a somewhat comedic story as Porter seeks $70,000 while he has the outfit, an Asian gang, as well as corrupt cops looking for his blood.Mel Gibson does a great job playing the quasi-looney thief/hit-man. His role is very reminiscent of his role in Lethal Weapon, except this time he is on a different side of the law.

It's refreshing to see a movie where the main character isn't a flawless, lovable hero who always does what's right. That's just not real. Everybody makes mistakes, and it's nice to see this depicted fairly believably in a film like this. The narration gives it a nice feel of neo-noir to it, and the dark humor and metaphors make for great(if ever-so-slightly hard to watch) entertainment. The action is somewhat limited, but it's not really an action movie(plus, what there is is bad-ass). It's more a story of revenge; Porter feels he's been wronged, and he won't quit until he's gotten the revenge that he wants(including the *exact* amount of money stolen from him). The plot is pretty good, and moves along at a nice pace, once it takes off, which it unfortunately doesn't really do for the first half hour or so(though I wouldn't call what happens up to that boring). The acting is all pretty good. The characters are all well-written and fairly diverse in their actions; most of them are credible. The dark, cynical mood, helped along nicely with the blue tinting and the brutality of the events fits perfectly. The production design is excellent, with its non-retro approach to a 70's look. I think what I enjoyed most about the movie was Porter's(Mel Gibson) dry wit, in every possible situation, he'd crack jokes, and handle the situation in a perfectly calm manner. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good anti-hero action flick, and fans of the neo-noir film genre. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Not bad","Date":"4 May 2004","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":"  I found this film to be quite entertaining and insightful.

Managing to get himself to a doctor Porter has the bullets taken out of his back and is slowly nursed back to health. With his body and memory back to normal Porter has one and just one thing on his mind To get his share of the $140,000.00 that he took from the Chinese mob the 70 grand and nothing will get in his way no matter how big or small it is to stop him from getting it. Tracking down Lynn to her hotel room that she's staying at Porter sees that she's wasted on drugs and the next morning he finds that she's dead from an overdose. A short time later the doorbell rings and it's Lynn's drug pusher with her daily fix. Porter at first lets the dealer in and then asks him who he works for. Not getting the answer that he wants Poter works the dealer over so bad that his memory suddenly comes back. Going to the place when the drugs came from, a cab dispatchers office in downtown Chicago, Porter flattens the hulking bodyguard at the door for not being too cooperative with him. Porter goes in and confronts Artie who owns the place who playing cards with two corrupt Chicago undercover cops. The cops are there knowing that he's dealing drugs but upset in that they aren't getting their share of the drug money from Artie. Trying to find out from Artie where his ex-partner Val is Porter gets nothing out of him but this time he's a little more civil because of the presents of the policemen. Porter next goes to a bar nightclub where a call-girl Rosie, Maria Bello,that he knew may have some information on where Val is. Told that she works out of the Regal hotel Porter finds the bartender there very uncooperative until he slams the bar lid on his fingers where he then tells him everything that he wants to know. Rosie, surprise that he's alive, tells Porter where Val stays and Porter finds him there in bed with a hooker. Instead of killing him, like Val thought that he'll do, Porter tells Val to get him his 70 grand that he ripped off from him if he wants to stay alive and be healthy. Val instead of getting the 70 grand that he owes Porter tips off the Chinese mob to where Porter will be! The place Val is to meet Porter and give him his money. The Chinese mob first try to run Porter down in the street and then tries to do something even worse to him before their interrupted by the two cops that he met at Artie's cab office. The cops were tailing him to find out where and when Porter would get his 70 grand and then rip him off or kill him to get it away from him. The dirty cops do a job on Porter as well but like the Duracell Bunny Porter just keeps taking a licking but still goes right on ticking. At Rosie's place after she patched him up, from the beating he got from the Chinese mob and corrupt cops, Porter goes out and some time later Val breaks into her apartment and mistakenly shoots and wounds her dog who's also named Porter. Val thinking that he, the dog, was THE Porter lying under the blanket on Rosie's bed then gets to work on Rosie. Beating up Rosie and then just when Val is just about to rape and murder her the door swings open and it's Porter, the man not the dog, in person and in living color. In an instant Porter sends Val almost into the next room with a blast from his magnum revolver that leaves him barley alive and breathing. Getting Val to tell him who he works for, a Mr. Carter played by William Devane, in order to get the 70 grand that Val paid him to be a member of his organization Porter puts Val out of his misery by blowing his brains out. The movie Payback goes on with Porter in his quest for his hard earned 70 grand that he got ripped off leaving a trail of broken heads arms legs and bodies along the way. By then there's nobody left standing between his 70 grand but Mr. Big himself Bronson, Kris Kristofferson, the head of the Chicago Syndicate. Porter brazenly kidnaps Bronson's teenage son Johnny to make sure that he pays up which ,if he wasn't by then, Porter became a walking dead man for doing that! But Porter already worked himself up from the dead to become the most feared man alive in the city of Chicago. With the best, or worst, yet to come Payback is one of the most violent movies that I've ever seen. Mel Gibson's Porter ranks right up there as one of the most cold blooded and ironically at the same time ethical, all he wants is his 70 grand nothing more nothing less, killers ever seen on film. With the flamboyant ending of the Bronson gang Porter finally gets his hard earned but elusive 70 grand. In the final scene of the movie we see Porter Rosie and her dog Porter drive into the sunrise going to Canada to have breakfast. Porter ends the movie promising Rosie that if she stops hooking he'll stop shooting people. After what we saw in the movie this is an awful big order to expect from Porter and he knows it too saying to himself as the movies ending credits are rolling we were both aiming high.

The writing is good, the dialogue smart and the acting from a cast of unknowns, has-beens and b-listers is superb.  What's more, Mel Gibson, who usually hides his short stature, is shown at normal size which serves to emphasize the David-and-Goliath story.  His larger-than-life persona (and sometimes over-the-top acting style) are almost hidden.  It's a good choice as it makes him seem that much tougher, as well as much more sympathetic. Another interesting choice is that the film is awash in shades of blue.  It's almost a blue-and-white movie.

Ever notice that with every action film, the girls can dish it out, but they never can take it? We are treated to countless scenes in Payback of the sexy female gangster beating males bloody, but not a hair on her head is harmed. I guess in Hollywoodland, it's perfectly laudable for women to be perpetrators of violence but it's completely unacceptable for them to be victims of it.Yes, I realize that BAD guys in movies do beat up on women.

And there are not only cool one-liners and cool behaviors. The characters are very strong. Mel Gibson did a very good job, but I think that the three co-stars has stolen him the show. First there is his opponent (Gregg Henry). His face and his acting is brilliant, and he has almost the same acting like Gary Busey. Second there is Carter (William Devane). He is playing a very dangerous boss in a brilliant way.

The action doesn't let up, without spending much time on chases etc. which are unnecessary to a plot. By cutting out that crap, this film is still ahead of its time.

It is an update of the 1930's and '40's kind of movies called Film Noir. All the great actors in this kind of film from that era would have loved it, such as Humphrey Bogart and Robert Mitchum. This is a perfect homage to a classic style of film, down to all its details, especially using the washed out blue coloration to remind us of those old black and white films.No wonder all these great modern actors took roles in it. The hero is a bad guy, and his opponents are worse bad guys; and, he wins and they loose. Being a modern film they get to shoot scenes of even more violence, all very stylized, and the voice over narration by Mel Gibson, and the lines of dialog are all right on the money.Lucy Liu is choice as a savagely funny dominatrix. Each tiny role is perfect and the language usages are all fun, such as calling a hand gun a roscoeIf you like Film Noir movies, this is a joy. "},{"Title":"Alright, nothing spectacular. But great fun none the less.","Date":"3 October 2009","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Drama","Review":" Let me start off by saying that this movie wasn't half bad, It could have been better but not half bad. Payback is about tough guy Porter who wants just one thing and one thing only, Payback! As the title so justly puts and he wants his money that was taken from him and he'll do anything and everything to get it back.What I found interesting about this film was the malicious way it was played out it was like an evil little wind up monkey that kept clattering and making noise and irritating yo until you got fed up and just step on the darn thing. Well that's the main plot for the movie, it's meant to zip along at only an 1hr. 34 mins. and it expects you to be entertained by this mess, but a good mess it was. Mel Gibson plays a character he's played a thousand times the macho tough guy with no fear. He played this type in all four Lethal Weapon movies, he played this again in Mad Max 1,2 and 3. So why did he try and see if he could pull it off again? Well because he can! And he did! Gibson puts some humanity and somewhat of a soul in an almost soulless character and he does it with such style and grace that it almost makes you want to slap Porter instead of punching him. And that's something, not by much, but something. Brian Helgeland( co-write for L.A. Confidential) tries to play on that moody, devil may care, I'll shoot you if you look at me cross eyed type of Anti-hero and that's all in good but the anti-hero he's created Porter is not somebody you can relate to, or even like for that matter, there were some scenes like I said that you wanted to hit Porter and then there were some scenes that you sympathized with him very well. And there is where this films greatness lies it gives you two sides of the coin to see, on one side the nasty Porter on the other side the kind and loving Porter. It gives you two sides to a very complicated and very world weary man and in my opinion that makes this a good movie.Payback is not action thriller greatness like Lethal Weapon or Die Hard but it does come very close, oh so very close, But the thing is with this movie is that it borders on almost a Noirish type style of cinematography and that up's it appeal to me and who know who else, but in the under lying layers of the film it does have greatness in it it just hasn't been able to tap into it fully but as time goes by this film will become a Mel Gibson classic and a cult classic for that matter. But is Payback a terrible movie? no way! Is it movie making magic? Sorry to tell you no, nothing magical about this one but it is great fun to watch play out and follow along. All in all Payback is an almost can't miss action drama, it flows along nice and it delivers it's punches nicely, it doesn't waste your time and it is great, irresistible fun. Payback is a revenge plot you want to be apart of.

Not only do men get beaten to a pulp, women do, too. There is a nitty-gritty feel to the film that does not go unnoticed. Even a dog gets shot - but the dog does not die, of course, because that would be showing something inhumane. Screw any human corpses that might (God help us!) appear on screen - dog corpses will send audiences fleeing!With all the major advertising for this film, you probably know by now that Mel Gibson plays a bad guy in Payback. He's never played an all-out bad guy like this before - his baddie in Tequila Sunrise was a nice bad guy, this guy is a bad bad guy with streaks of bad. In a world of evil people he is the one we root for because the film has been crafted that way, and because he is a one-man-army (we always feel sorry for the underdogs) - but if you put him in a room with Riggs and Murtaugh, his chances for applause from an audience would be significantly decreased. Gibson plays Porter. I don't know his first name, he's just always gone by Porter, a man says later in the film. Porter is a thief. As the credits role, he wakes up from a (wound-induced coma/injury/nap). In the first five minutes, he has stolen from a crippled Vietnam veteran, pickpocketed a man's wallet, stiffed a waitress, and used the said credit card to buy a nice fancy suit and dinner. Later, when his meal is over, a waiter informs him the credit card he is trying to pay with has been canceled. Nonsense, Porter says. Try it again. The waiter then leaves and so does Porter.In his sadistic voice-over narration, Porter informs us, Not many men know how much their lives are worth. I do. Seventy grand. That's how much they took from me, that's how much I was gonna get back. We find out that some time before his coma/nap, Porter had pulled off a heist - only to be pumped full of lead by his friend, Val (Gregg Henry), and his wife (Deborah Kara Ungar), who took the cash and ran.Now Porter's back, and he wants his money. Not any less, and not any more. Porter doesn't want the money as much as he wants to teach people not to mess with him. As always, there is a love interest, and going with the dirty flow of the film, this love interest is a hooker named Rosie (Maria Bello). Porter used to drive Rosie, and we find out at a seemingly haphazard point in the film that they shared a night of passion together.The film is dreadfully a-typical, but Mel Gibson's sadistic lead performance makes it worth watching. He hisses and uses violence like a real screen villain, while at the same time he spews out harsh (and funny) one-liners with such comedic talent that it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role.David Paymer and Bill Duke also have small roles as crooked cops (although I'm not sure if Paymer is a cop he hangs out with them). You may remember Bill Duke as Mac from Predator, the Arnold Schwarzenegger film. He's a good co-star, if a bit repetitive, and David Paymer provides some comic relief.Basically everyone dies in Payback. Everyone except You-Know-Who and You-Know-Who's Girl. Oh, and The Dog (who I have a feeling will spawn a spin-off series of sequels named Pawback). During an hour and fifty minutes, six men are incinerated in fire, countless men are shot, and James Coburn's alligator skin suitcases get a bullet through them. And Mel does a great job of carrying the lead role in what would at first appear to be an action-star-crafted character.
