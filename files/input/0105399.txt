One grows to fight crime while the other becomes a famous conductor. They can apparently feel the effect of the other, which is handled very poorly. Obviously both Chans will be confused with the crime fighter conducting a concert and the conductor forced into criminology. This theme was done every bit as badly in The Corsican Brothers but at least the stunts by Chan are amusing and the only areas of compliment otherwise it is one fight after another. Of course, the other film was done badly by Cheech and Chong so viewers can take their extreme chances on either one. Both Tsui Hark and Ringo Lam can handle action but not screenplays. They fail when the whole touch element regarding the other twin isn't totally realized. With two roles Chan comes off with both the exhilarating action star as well as the witty funny side. We know where this is heading but Chan can only do his best and entertain regardless of how bad the material is. Also featured in bad performances are Maggie Cheung, Teddy Rubin and Alfred Cheung, none of whom will likely win any rewards for their contribution here. It proves that Chan can be twice as bad with twice the screen time.

Afterwards, I stuttered through an explanation of why it was really a funny, exciting film only to be met by blank stares.I'll give only one example The scene in the mall. (semi-spoiler) Originally, it was an exciting, but funny scene that ends with the thug Jackie beats up wanting to be his student! Not only is all of the character development in the scene cut out, but the music is completely altered to try to make a comic scene seem like a deadly serious fight!Clearly, someone at the distribution company decided that American audiences were so tone-deaf that they simply couldn't appreciate wit and cleverness, only rock-em, sock-em brain-dead action, so they performed a lobotomy on this swell little gem.They should change their names to Silk Purse Into Sow's Ear Production Company.Perhaps future reviewers will bother to note whether they saw the full 100 minute Hong Kong version or the embarrassing (let's all cover our eyes quickly) 89 minute American mess.

The 'twins-effect' which occurs all through the film is a nice element to spice up the plot. Naturally Jackie gives us a brilliant physical performance as well.The only real problem with Twin Dragons is that it doesn't offer anything particularly new or different from other Jackie films and thus feels a little unremarkable.

Jackie Chan plays Boomer/John, who is separated from his twin at birth and they reunite under unfortunate circumstances. One of the twins, John, is a acclaimed classical concert conductor and a talented pianist whilst the other, Boomer, is a streetwise mechanic with impressive martial arts skills. When John travels to Hong Kong to perform at a highly rated concert, he meets up with his brother Boomer, who has got himself in trouble with the mob because his best friend wanted his help to rescue a young girl who sang for them. John is also being set up to marry a young girl who has a brutal boyfriend who wants his girlfriend back, so they are both mixed up in situations that they don't really want to be in. When there identities are mixed up by both parties, they join forces to take down the baddies and to save Boomers best friend. The storyline was completely ridiculous and the constant confusion between the twins became a bit tedious after a while. I also found the girls quite annoying and the action scenes weren't that impressive. On the plus side, it did really look like there was two Jackie Chans on screen at the same time, whilst interacting with each other but apart from that, there was just too much going on throughout the movie. Boomers best friend just kept on getting Boomer in trouble so a lot of the storyline was based of events that wasn't caused by him. At the end of the day, it's just another one of those comedic movies from Chan that wasn't that great and I doubt that I'll be watching it again, anytime soon. Disappointing!Round-Up This movie was directed by Ringo Lam whose made 26 movies in his career, which include movies with Jean Claude Van Damme, when his career was going downhill. With Damme he made In Hell, Replicant and Maximum Risk and he also made City On Fire with Chow Yun-Fat. This is the first and only movie that he made with Chan and I must admit, it wasn't that great. I didn't find the jokes that amusing and the far fetched storyline, went a bit too far.Budget $10million Worldwide Gross $8.3millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/martial arts/comedies starring Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung and Teddy Robin Kwan. 2/10 "},{"Title":"A wild, goofy tour de force.","Date":"4 June 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Martial artist Jackie Chan plays twins Ma Yau and Wan Ming, who were separated at birth. One is a street smart mechanic and the other is a classical musician. When the course of events bring the twins together in one city, their lives become entangled with one another, with them assuming the opposite roles of each other.The plot device for this movie is clever, but the execution was a messy tour de force of goofy humor, poor dubbing and lack of suspense. The first part of the movie was actually pretty boring - the so-called fight at the karaoke scene was a drawn out element. The more exciting part doesn't come until the twins crosses paths with each other, and then they inadvertently take the others' lady friends out (played by Maggie Cheung and Nina Li Chi). Wan Ming trying to conduct the orchestra without knowing a lick about music was mildly amusing, while Ma Yau trying to rescue Wan Ming's friend (Teddy Robin Kwan) from the mob is somewhat entertaining.Maggie Cheung and Nina Li Chi look beautiful in the movie, but there wasn't a lot of character development on them. There is also cameo appearances from many familiar actors in Hong Kong cinema, but they were underused and most were not dubbed with their own voices (Hong Kong filmmakers used to film movies without audio and then have the characters' voices dubbed in during post-production). However, I do especially like the musical number where Jackie Chan is playing on the piano while Maggie Cheung is singing to Shirley Kwan's song called Ancient Times. Cheung looked very classy and glamorous in that scene. There is much action toward the end, but much of the movie is consumed from a plain plot and overboard goofiness. Overall, a less exciting film starring Jackie Chan.Grade C- "},{"Title":"Unremarkable but Decent","Date":"6 December 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Twin Dragons sees Jackie playing two characters, one a classical composer and the other a mechanic/thug who meet up after years of being separated.

It's the kind of wacky antics I enjoyed from my Jackie Chan movies when I was an early teenager, but has worn out as I got older. Technically it has some really good action scenes, especially the last one, though none are too memorable in the grand scheme of things.For me, this is a mildly amusing Chan movie. Nothing new here, just more of the same kind of antics you'd expect from Jackie. "},{"Title":"Comedy of Errors - Hong Kong Action style","Date":"25 December 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" This movie just goes off. It is the type of movie that as the credits are rolling at the end the movie still feels like it is going on. This, I think, is one of Jackie Chan's best movies. When it was released, comments were made about how is was similar to Van Damme's Double Impact. The SBS critic said that there was a slight difference between Twin Dragons and Double Impact Twin Dragons is ten times better. He is not wrong. However, Double Impact, while being an action movie, is not the only movie, or story, about twins and the comedy in which they are mistaken. There is Cheech and Chong's Corsican Brothers, and of course there is Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors (suggesting that the concept does predate the 15th Century since Shakespeare was hardly original).The movie is about identical twins who are violently separated at birth and do not know of each others existence. One becomes a concert pianist and the other an auto mechanic. Then the concert pianist comes to Hong Kong for a concert while the other becomes embroiled in a plot concerning a Hong Kong gang lord. Then the movie goes into a confusion where everybody is mistaking one of the twins for the other, and the twins, upon realising the other's existence, try to hide each other's existence.Theme wise the movie is quite shallow, but one does not watch Jackie Chan movies for the in-depth theme. If you want in-depth themes you watch Ridley Scott. Some directors, such as John Woo and James Cameron, are known for action and interweave themes in with their movies, but when it comes to Jackie Chan, all you have is cool comedy and cool fights. Personally the fight scenes in this movie were not all that cool, and actually started to get boring, but the whole twisted plot of Twin Dragons just went off. "},{"Title":"Double Chan Antics","Date":"16 December 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":" Neither bad dubbing nor shoddy split-screen special effects can sabotage the inspired antics in Twin Dragons, a nimbly done action farce featuring martial arts sensation Jackie Chan as identical twin brothers separated at birth but reunited year later when evil Triad mobsters try to murder one of them. Originally released as Shuang Long Hui in Hong Kong in 1992, Twin Dragons cost about $1.3 million, but this chopsocky slapstick earned megabucks at the Asian box office. Along with acclaimed action co-directors Ringo Lam of Maximum Risk and Tsui Hark of Double Team and Knock Off at the helm, Chan starred in the movie to raise funds for the fledging Hong Kong Directors Guild. Although seven years has elapsed since Shuang Long Hui opened, with VHS copies of it available under a number of titles, Dimension Films not only dusted off Twin Dragons but also has plastered it on screens across America.Look-a-like brothers has been a favorite theme for novelists and filmmakers long before Twin Dragons appeared. Mark Twain relied on same siblings as a staple plot device in his celebrated fiction. Like the 1991 Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller Double Impact, Twin Dragons casts Jackie Chan as heroic twins rather than as dramatic adversaries. Anybody remember Leonardo DiCaprio in The Man in the Iron Mask? Twin Dragons starts with a grim but vigorous black & white shoot-out at a hospital. A wounded but dangerous felon escapes from a police escort. Handcuffed to a cart, the villain swipes a detective's gun, shoots him as him, blows off the handcuffs and seizes one of the twin brothers. Wielding the baby as a shield, the henchman shoots another cop and steals an ambulance. An intrepid cop grabs the bumper and is dragged along the street until he puts a bullet in a rear tire. As the vehicle lurches to a halt, the child is hurled into a public grove. A drunken prostitute finds the child and raises him as her own son. Meanwhile, the grief-stricken parents migrate to New York City with their surviving son. Spared nothing by his indulgent parents, John Ma (Jackie Chan of Rush hour) grows up to be a world famous concert pianist/conductor. By comparison, scraping by on bits and pieces, the other twin&#x97;Boomer&#x97;develops incredible skills as a street fighter when he isn't fixing cars. John Ma leaves the Big Apple to make his Hong Kong debut when the Asian gangsters mistake him for Boomer. Boomer and hi troublesome buddy Tyson (Teddy Robin Kwan) owe the mob a hefty $300-thousand in HK funds, and they are out to collect when Ma shows up.Scenarists Barry Wong, Tsui Hark, Cheung Tung Jo and Wong Yik have added a fillip a la Cheech & Chong's The Corsican Brothers to the twin brother hysterics by endowing them with a telekinetic link. When John plays piano, Boomer watches while his fingers wriggle to a mysterious rhythm. Only near the end of the action do the filmmakers exploit this psychic power for its full potential. Separated from John by a fenced-in cage, Boomer acts out the kung-fu fight moves, and John inadvertently delivers those stunning blows to flatten his foes. Meanwhile, the scenarists have more fun with the familiar mistaken identities gag that dominates the first two-thirds of the film. Fate and destiny play an immutable part in the proceedings.In the tradition of Shakespeare's Comedy of Errors, Boomer and John Ma confuse themselves as well as their girlfriends. Inevitably, they wind up with the wrong girls, and the comic predicaments that emerge are entertaining. The fights and the chases are fast-paced and hilariously staged, but then look at the helmers&#x97;Lam and Hark. The fight scene in the Mitsubishi testing facility is a triumphant of comedy and choreography. If you can ignore the inferior dubbing and the obvious special effects, Twin Dragons is a rewarding riot of hilarity. Hardcore Jackie Chan fans should be able to spot how Chan has modified many of the stunts over the years and used them for full effect in his Rush Hour movies.

This film is not in my top 10 Jackie Chan films, but it's also not that bad. This film is directed by two very famous directors Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark. But I felt like they were not used properly in the production. Writers who were responsible for this film were Barry Wong(Writer Hard Boiled, Righting Wrongs, and Rosa)and Tsui Hark. So far this film has good writers and good directors. The lead actors are Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung(Police Story 1-3, and Project A 2), Nina Li Chi(Jet Li's Wife). Even the lead actors are good. Even the cameo's feature some very good actors like Ringo Lam as a car mechanic, John Woo as a priest, Tsui Hark as a car mechanic, Mars as a thug, and Jing Wong(writer High Risk with Jet Li, and City Hunter with Jackie Chan). So why are people not very happy with this movie? Well some people didn't like the comedy. I found this movie quite funny at times, but the comedy does get a little over board. This felt like City Hunter, because of the sence of comedy. There were not enough action scenes to keep some viewers happy. I will list them1. Fight at a Night Club. Very good fight including multiple villain's, and Jackie Chan going against all them. Jackie Chan uses a microphone as a prop which looked like very good piece of choreography.2. Boat Chase in the Ocean. This has lots of boat stunts, but not much martial arts. But we do see Jackie jump from one motor boat to another, which was some good action.3. Fight at a Mall with a thug who can't fight. This shows that Jackie Chan can so lots of kicks, while his opponent can't do any. This is a very short fight not even worth mentioning.4. Bus Chase across a Highway. Jackie Chan was probably stunt doubled for the driving, but I might be wrong. Very short but we do see Jackie Chan jump from the drivers seat onto the road.5. Fight at the Car Test Factory. This fight is worth seeing this movie for. Jackie Chan faces against 20 or more thugs. Also Jackie Chan does things like you never seen him do before like jumping through the passengers window, jumping out the passengers window, and doing a kick, and running over a car. Jackie Chan does some very nice kicks, and moves fast enough to make the scene stand out the most. Woo Ping Yuen(choreographer of Matrix movies), was responsible for Stunts and Action Design. But again he wasn't used very well, except the first and the last fight. Mars who appeared as a thug seemed to be the only Jackie Chan's Stunt Team Member who appeared in this film. This could be the reason why this film's action was not to the usual Jackie Chan's standard. I read that during the scene were there are two Jackie's in the bathtub with the girl, that Mars was the second Jackie. Mars doubled Jackie for that scene before they used special effects to change it to look like two Jackie's.This film deserves 7/10. But for the end fight 10/10. If you want to see some good action see this film for the end fight.

It's about 11 minutes shorter than the original film and I have no way of knowing how close it stuck to the original vision. It seemed to be dubbed reasonably well, but having never seen the original Chinese version, I am only guessing.The idea of making a Corsican Brothers-like film with two Jackie Chans sounded pretty dumb when I read about this movie. And, while in parts it is awfully silly, the overall effort was far better than I expected and was one of the better Chan movies I have seen.The movie begins with a prologue which shows how two twins were accidentally separated just after birth. The parents cannot locate the lost child and are forced to raise the remaining child. The second is fund by what appears to be a prostitute and this child is raised in a poor household. Many years later, when the rich and privileged Jackie returns to Hong Kong, he accidentally is mixed up for the poor one--the one that the local mob wants to kill! Now had this just been an action film with fight scene after fight scene, I think it wouldn't have worked as well. But, given that Jackie Chan did the movie a huge amount of comedy and clever situations involving two separate girlfriends were infused into the plot. Several times, I found myself laughing at some of the silliness of it all, but I also was impressed by how well the film all worked together pretty seamlessly.There were only two complaints about the film. First, the poor Jackie snorted a lot. Why? Couldn't there have been a better way to distinguish between them than making one of them sound like he's a pig or has a really bad cold? Secondly, the film seemed to go on a bit too long--particularly at the action-packed conclusion. Knocking five or ten minutes off would have probably made the film a bit better--as the fight scene just went on and on and on. Still, this is a decent martial arts film and is worth a look and a laugh.FYI--The film's second billing went to Maggie Cheung--a relatively famous Asian actress who has made a variety of excellent films. However, her role was no bigger or more prominent than the other lady in the film who didn't appear until much further in the credits. Bummer.

In addition to using the wonderful plot premise of twins (and two Jackie Chans is definitely better than one), there's some great action choreography in this movie, including some nice big explosions, and what has to be one of the best uses ever conceived of for a Mitsubishi factory.The psychic link between the twin Chans is used to great effect as well, in everything from the hilarious conducting scene, to the subtly painful groin shot during the auto factory fight.And the ending? Is simply brilliant.I definitely recommend this understated, oft-overlooked gem to all Chan fans.

All the characters are cool, and the story is very entertaining, plus Jackie Chan is simply amazing in this!. I really liked the opening in black and white when they showed the twins as kids, and I loved the reference to Stallone and The Rocky movies with Tammy's(Nina Li Chi) boyfriend Rocky, plus it has some pretty good fights in it too. I actually found this to be more of a Comedy, but that's OK because it was highly enjoyable, and I think this should be higher then 6.0, plus the ending is absolutely hilarious!. As always Jackie does some amazing stunts, and the scene where Jackie and Tyson(Teddy Robin Kwan) escape on the boat is pretty exciting, plus while some of the humor is incredibly silly I couldn't help but laugh at it. The scene where Boomer plays at the Orchestra and does John Ma's work is a scream, plus the fight at the car wash is also hilarious! (since the brother John Ma can't fight). This is a funny Jackie Chan film, that's great fun to watch, with some awesome stunts, and two knockout performances from Jackie Chan, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is great!. Ringo Lam and Hark Tsui do a great! job here with very good camera work, good angles and just keeping the film funny and at a very fast pace. The Acting is lots of fun!. Jackie Chan is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is hilarious, extremely likable as both Boomer and Joh Ma, had great chemistry with both Maggie Cheung and Nina Li Chi, kicked that ass, and was absolutely charming! (Jackie Rules!!!!!!!). Maggie Cheung is gorgeous and does fine as Boomer's(well technically) love interest, she was likable and did a great job I really liked her. Teddy Robin Kwan is funny as Boomer's best friend Tyson, he was likable and added a lot of laughs I dug him. Nina Li Chi is beautiful, and also did fine as John Ma's love interest (well technically), I really liked her. Alfred Cheung is good as the villain and was menacing. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall I highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5 "},{"Title":"great fun","Date":"5 July 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Comedy","Review":"  Whatever you do, ALWAYS keep away from any U.S release of any non-Hollywood movie Jackie has done, because they're absolutly awful.If, however, you see Twin Dragons as it is supposed to be, you're in for a hilariously fun time, though if you're looking for really stand-out action scenes then you may be disapointed, as comedy is the order of the day here.

When they meet up on accident one day for the first time, as you can imagine, wackiness ensues. There are only two real martial arts battles, both of which are good, but really aren't needed, because they really dont go with the main plot, just a boring sub-plot about Boomer's friend who owes money to some guy, or something like that. But you should see this movie just for Jackie playing two brothers, and he plays them hilariously. A good comedy, with some good action thrown in. A must for Jackie fans.

Sadly, the amount of action on offer isn't the only disappointment, the predictable and repetitious mix-ups proving more cringe-worthy than chuckle-some, and the effects used to allow Jackie to interact with himself being far from special.It's not all a total loss, though Maggie Cheung and Nina Li Chi provide some welcome eye candy as the brother's girlfriends (it says a lot about the beauty of Li Chi that she manages to make Maggie Cheung look rather plain in comparison), and director Ringo Lam finally gets his act together for a rousing fight in a car testing factory, an environment that allows for some impressively dangerous kung fu craziness from at least one of the Chans.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.

A load of rubbish, unfortunately. Made as a fundraiser for the Hong Kong Directors' Guild, Twin Dragons was painful enough in its original 100-minute version, but rescored, redubbed and shorn of 15 minutes by scissor-happy Miramax offshoot Dimension Pictures it's gone from being a vaguely comprehensible bad picture to an almost completely incomprehensible even worse one.It's the usual Corsican Brothers/mistaken identity plot (separated at birth, one twin grows up to be a streetwise hustler with an irritating sinus problem, the other an acclaimed conductor and concert pianist until - well, you know the rest), but thanks to perfunctory writing and tired unimaginative staging it's a bit of a chore to watch. Despite some good opening stunts it's mostly a rather inept comedy with a leaning towards bedroom farce, not helped by some variable special effects - at one point Chan walks through his brother's arm in a muffed process shot that really should have stayed on the cutting room floor but which typifies the It'll do spirit of the enterprise. As for the truly irritating vertically challenged sidekick - Randy Newman's Short People could have been written with him in mind.There is one good (not great, just good) fight scene in and around various cars in a test laboratory, as well as a neat cameo by the two directors as cheating card players (John Woo also turns up in one shot as a priest), but it's definitely not enough for any but the Chan completists. As with all of Buena Vista's back-catalog of dubbed and re-edited HK releases there are no extras (though Chan does dub himself in the English-language version, whereas in the Hong Kong cut he's dubbed into Cantonese by another actor), but after seeing this, the only extra you'd be interested in is an apology. Of course, as you would expect with a turkey, the 2.351 transfer and sound are both very good.

Rather, they're merely a backdrop upon which countless hand-to-hand fights and slapstick humor are placed, and while they're not necessarily thought-provoking, they are by no means a waste of time to individuals who enjoy more intellectual entertainment.But with Twin Dragons, it appears as though the story did indeed destroy the movie, to the point where even the action scenes couldn't salvage the film from its inherent ennui.The film's worst traits are perhaps its predictability and repetition.  For example, in the beginning we are introduced to the two single elements which will play out implacably for the remainder of the film confusion in regards to which of the twins is who, and how when one of the twins performs one action, the other is psychically affected and carries it out as well.  The film apparently thrives on this to the point where it becomes tiresome after about half an hour, and the manner in which it does it leads one to seriously question the mental capacity of the individuals involved.  Never in a movie have I seen women portrayed to be such imbeciles.A couple of the action scenes are worth mention, but the unfortunate aspect of the matter is that unless one watches them separately from the rest of the film, there really isn't much to attract attention.  That is, by the time that we have been subjected to the asininity of all the supporting characters in the dialogue sections of the film, we really do not want to see them partake in the fights--and more than once I found myself wishing that the screenwriters had done away with these characters earlier in the story so as to not involve them in any but one or two of the action sequences.For the casual movie watcher, I would consider this to be poison--stay away at any cost, even if you're paid to watch this film.  Die-hard Jackie Chan fans may enjoy a couple of scenes, which display a little wit as to how to incorporate Chan's natural charm into the eccentricity of the situations, and some of the stunts are somewhat impressing, though nowhere near the caliber of some of those that he has performed in the latter half of the '90s.
