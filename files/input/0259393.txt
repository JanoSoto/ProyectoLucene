[{"Title":"One of the year's most compelling character studies. **** (out of four)","Date":"7 January 2002","Score":"52 out of 57 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  LANTANA  (2001) **** (out of four)Lantana does not embody a story like most movies; it isn't about anything in particular.  It's a movie about characters. Not larger-than-life super heroes, but characters who succumb to temptation, cheat on their wives, doubt their spouses, make mistakes and suffer consequences. In other words, Lantana is about real people. Normal, imperfect people like all of us. Not that everyone behaves like the characters here, but few films capture transgression with such compassion and sympathy.Set in Australia, a colorful pallet of characters paints a vivid, coherent psychological portrait of infidelity, deceit, and estrangement. At the center of the film is four couples, immersed in guilt and depravity for different reasons. Everybody has something to hide. The conflicts of these people illuminate the personal crisis of a police detective (Anthony LaPaglia) as he investigates the disappearance of a local woman.Apart from the investigation, the couples have little connection with each other. They do have one thing in common, however, that none of them communicates with their loved ones. Lantana proves communication enforces commitment, but a lack thereof results in disaster. This sincere, uncompromising picture places the lack of communication at the center of family problems. The film won various Australian Film Awards for its performances, screenplay, and direction by Ray Lawrence. Lawrence clearly intended the title-referring to a tropical shrub with beautiful flowers that hide dense, thorny undergrowth-to represent the characters' private lives hidden behind an outward appearance. He's got the wrong metaphor. These characters do not appear sunny on the inside, outside, front or back. They don't wear masks or attempt to cover their frowning states of mind. They are unhappy people, and the movie never pretends otherwise.Those qualities make the characters absorbing. Instead of providing them with outlets and opportunities to hide their faults, the film pokes, prods, and starves them of their happiness until they reach a breaking point. For some, the breaking point results in an explosion of anger. For others, it's subtle and personal. Lantana investigates real people who deal with real situations and encounter real consequences. None of the characters are model citizens, yet we care deeply about each of them. When someone cries, we feel sorry for them. When someone begs for forgiveness, we try to forgive them. When someone questions their spouse, we are concerned with both sides of the marriage. These people make big mistakes; the results of their mistakes are never certain. The movie does not neatly pull things together at the end. It doesn't allow the characters an easy way out. These characters must dig themselves out of their problems.Lantana is one of the most compelling, involving films of the year. It's based on a play called Speaking in Tongues by Andrew Bovell, who also wrote the fluid screenplay. I want to see this play. If these characters feel so alive, so real, so tormented on screen, think of their power in person.

He becomes irritable and flies off the handle at things of little importance, and becomes consumed with guilt.He is not alone. The marriage of John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) and psychiatrist Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) is falling apart as Knox seeks something from the outside and Somers is torn apart with the suspicion that he is having a homosexual affair, perhaps with one of her clients. Meanwhile Jane O'May (Zat's adulteress played by Rachael Blake) finds that she needs a man, or maybe two, other than her estranged husband. Even Sonja Zat (Kerry Armstrong) feels the pressure and yearns to feel attractive, perhaps with younger men.More than halfway through we have an apparent murder and an investigation during the course of which some of the adulteries come to light and cause the participants to examine themselves and their lives closely.Andrew Dovell wrote the subtle, richly attired script, full of penetrating dialogue and an uncompromising veracity, adapting it from his play Speaking in Tongues. Ray Lawrence directed in an unusual but compelling manner in which the scenes are sharply focused and cut to linger in our minds. Again and again I was startled with just how exactly right was something a character said or did. Lawrence's exacting attention to detail gives the film a textured and deeply layered feel so that one has the sense of real life fully lived. The cast is uniformly excellent although LaPaglia stands out because of his most demanding role. His performance is one of the best I have seen in recent years. The only weakness in the film is a somewhat lethargic start, partially caused by Lawrence's cinéma vérité scene construction and editing. What he likes to do is lead us to a realization along with the characters and then punctuate the experience by lingering on the scene, or in other cases by cutting quickly away. Often what other directors might show, he leaves to our imagination, and at other times he shows something seemingly trivial which nonetheless stays in our mind. John Knox's affair, for example, is not shown. Jane O'May and her husband's reconciliation is left to our mind's eye. Yet the scene with Valerie Somers in the lighted telephone booth (with graffiti) is shown at length and then what happens next is not. These are interesting directorial choices.The ending comes upon us, as it sometimes should, unexpectedly, but then resonates so that we can see and feel the resolution. Not everything is tied up. Again we are left in some cases to use our own imagination.This original film, one of the best of the new millennium I have seen, stayed with me long after they ran the closing credits. It is well worth the two hours.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

The classic 'mystery' thread was really only the setting for the several different relationships and couples featured in the film.But having said that, the story itself was gutsy and twisting to keep you guessing till the end, all without the need for non-essential narrative or the need to keep spelling things out. The questions were all answered so far as the story was concerned, but because of the complexity and realism in all the principle characters, i still left the cinema rolling plenty of the emotional issues through my mind for hours after.La Paglia was fantastic. His character, though shown as an adulterer from the very beginning, captured so many of the current male 'indentities' with great subtlety instead of a stereotyped 'hug session'  which most recent films dealing with the subject matter inevitably lead to. He so easily showed the internal conflicts which most normal Australian men deal with day-to-day while still keeping up the brave face we all do.I also enjoyed the quirky way the relatively small number of characters were all drawn together by fairly consequential links, and without a huge big statement of it in the end - no matter how many people there are on the planet, it still amazes me how small and incestual problem-circles end up becoming )This film has the potential to appeal to so many different audiences - works as a mystery, cop-drama, chick flick, and to anyone who could ever relate to the 'feel' of Australia, which the film captures perfectly through great ambient audio and natural-looking lighting.Well written, directed, photographed and cast give this one an easy full marks.

Also, for that matter, why are they comparing it to Short Cuts and Magnolia? Lantana is a fine film thanks to the sure direction of Ray Lawrence and the fine script by Andrew Bovell. This was certainly a nice surprise coming from Australia, which has given us a great many interesting films and that keeps telling world wide audiences there sure is life after Hollywood and the formula styled fare that has been coming from the La-La Land in the last years.To begin with, the cast is first rate. Anthony Lapaglia keeps getting better and better all the time. Aside from his work on stage, namely, The Rose Tatoo and A View from the Bridge, on Broadway, his appearances in films are always convincing. He's the kind of actor that doesn't repeat himself. He has such a presence and magnetism that we can't take our eyes from him throughout the duration of Lantana.His character here is full of anger. He's at the point in his life where a mistake will make him lose his wife and children by straying to an area where he shouldn't have gone in the first place. His wife beautifully played by Kerry Armstrong is incredible. She has an integrity and dignity that many women should envy. She's sure of herself and her life with even a husband that might have and affair but who comes running back to her when he realizes what's at stake.Barbara Hershey is another actress that always gives us a new dimension to her craft. She's never been better in her last appearances under the direction of Mr. Lawrence. Even Geoffrey Rush, an actor who could go off the top in many of his roles, plays the right note here. The rest of the cast is excellent. Lantana is a great film. The best thing is to relax and enjoy this well crafted drama.

The acting is all intelligently filled with nuance and not a one steps, even briefly, outside the realm of believability. The camera is sophisticated without being showy. The music -- acoustic picking, rhythmic electric strumming, sparse piano -- underscores the film without ever making itself obvious or taking over. The screenplay (based on a play) consists of characters whose lives intersect in a way that's novel, yet not unbelievably so. The editing is smooth and unnoticeable and the direction is sharp and unobtrusive.The film opens with the camera showing a dead body lying in an area of thickets. We're shown at the opening but won't need to worry about it for another hour. The first hour of the film is based solely on the relationships of its interconnecting characters.We next see Leon (Anthony LaPaglia) having sex with a woman, who we later learn to be Jane (Rachael Blake). He's married, though, to Sonya (Kerry Armstrong) and she goes to a psychiatrist unbeknownst to Leon. It seems like Leon may be trying to cover up, or make seem less damaging to his marriage, his affair -- which he seems to get little joy from -- by making sure his two sons give him a kiss on the neck before going off to school. Leon is also a cop and early in the film he takes out his aggression -- which is a result of his pain -- on a drug dealer by being more rough with him than he should.The psychiatrist Sonya goes to, Dr. Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) has another patient, Patrick (Peter Phelps). He's been seeing a married man and asks Valerie what he should do. Valerie, we see, grows uneasy, as if it hits close to home. As if she's dealt with this before. In a public speech she gives, Valerie (or should I say, the director) says that the home is a battleground for most, though it's not supposed to be. It is for her as well. She's lost her daughter to a murder and her relationship with her husband, John (Geoffrey Rush) is becoming increasingly empty. She suspects he may be having an affair as well. When someone repeats something for us, Making love to her was like trying to fill an empty well, we're fully aware that while one person in particular seems to take this to heart, this relates to each and every one of these characters. One reviewer on this site said that the characters in the film aren't full people. And I agree with him, only in a different way. They're fully fleshed-out characters, but they're only half full because they're perpetually bereft. Except for Paula (Daniella Farinacci) and Nik (Vince Colosimo), the couple that lives across the street from Jane. Later in the film when Paula says He told me, the line has more meaning than it seems. This is the one relationship that is the exception to the film's rule.The subtle hints we're given may or may not be important later on in the story, which after the half-way mark involves a police investigation; and the film manages to remain a drama about its characters throughout. The investigation exists in the background, as a device. It's strange that anyone would think the film is about the investigation by itself. If the film is about any one thing, it's about love and the quest to repair it after it's been damaged.Valerie's own marital problems come to a head when she accosts a man on the street and accuses him of making a comment about her under his breath. The man turns out to be the ex-wife of Jane, who we meet again later during the investigation.One night, Leon comes home to find his wife not there, goes to find her and discovers that she's gone to a dance club. The two have been taking dancing lessons, but Leon isn't very enthusiastic about them. Leon gets progressively more angry at himself, while Valerie is trying to make the best of a bad situation, even if the situation (at least on her side) gets inadvertently worse because of it. She's not out for revenge for what she suspects of her husband.When Valerie drives down a back road and gets in an accident, she walks to a closed gas station and calls her husband, John and confronts him. When she doesn't come home, Leon and his partner Claudia (Leah Purcell), who's looking for love herself, are assigned to the missing persons case. There's wicked dramatic irony when John, after being questioned by Leon about his whereabouts and reacting with anger, asks him how he would react if his wife were to get in a car with a stranger, which is what the police have suspected Valerie did. In one scene between Leon and John (who is a suspect in his wife's disappearance) John admits that he didn't listen to his wife's very real cries for help.By the end of the film, its stance towards marriage becomes, I think, increasingly pessimistic, as if any slight crack in a relationship would mean that both sides are doomed. But in the last segment, after the investigation is resolved, there's a glimmer of light for its characters. The final image suggests that the characters, and Leon in particular, have hope in working through their pain and transgressions and may someday be able to resume the dance.**** "},{"Title":"incredible acting by the cast","Date":"30 March 2003","Score":"22 out of 32 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  I thought this movie was very good.

New to U.S. audiences, Kerry Armstrong is captivating.While it's absolutely fascinating to see how screenwriter Andrew Bovell opened up his play Speaking in Tongues, though both stand on their own, particularly for their frank look at the issue of the frailty of trust and betrayal, between husbands and wives, lovers, families and friends. The movie makes much better thematic use of a cinematic technique of visual coincidences that other films have used as a gimmick. Here the coincidences provide crucial, ever more difficult tests, leading to either sins of omission or sins of commission as those without trust jump to conclusions or hold on to their love and faith in their partner. The music is by Paul Kelly and is superbly atmospheric, creating a noir atmosphere and building up the tension with a continuing theme that alternates with sexy salsa music. In particular, a leit motif plays ominously whenever the titular, tropical plant fills the screen.The crowded audience interpreted ironic comments as high comedy, which was annoying, but perhaps helped to break the tension. There was a lot of audience talking as the story was half-told visually --a particularly neat change from the original play--and the coincidences would be revealed to the audience.This is a sophisticated film for grown-ups that absolutely respects the intelligence of its viewers.

The film uses the nonlinear Magnoia-esque jigsaw puzzle approach showing a piece of each player one at a time while methodically completing the final puzzle picture. Though the film involves a cop, a shrink, a missing woman, infidelity, adultery, grief, suspicion, etc., Lantana isn't about any of these things; a fact which is made clear in the end when the final puzzle piece is dropped into place.

"},{"Title":"Sometimes love isn't enough","Date":"20 September 2006","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" Australian cinema has gone through many phases - more downs than ups. Out of nowhere emerged this absolute gem of a film. The popularity and critical acclaim encouraged the director to follow up with Jindabyne - another gem, but probably just didn't hit the heights of this one.As with Jindabyne, this film is high metaphorical and to some degree, open to interpretation. But much like Woody Allen, there is a reluctance to dumb it down; instead allowing the audience to discover the so-called underlying themes and messages of the film upon reflection. Really good study for high school English students in my view. Unfortunately, in the pursuit of not dumbing it down, many people don't get it or don't get it entirely. For this reason, I just thought i'd throw you a couple of insights (spoilers below)DANCING - METAPHOR At the start, they are learning to dance. Now dancing symbolises unity of a man and woman in harmonious coordination (marriage). The fact that they are learning to dance at the start of the film indicates that they need guidance or further development. They are unable to dance together, indicating problems with marriages is a theme of this film. Perhaps love got it started, but isn't sustaining it. Shortly after, he starts his affair with another dancing class member. LACK OF COMMUNICATION - THEME This was the major point of the film. Relationships do not survive where communication is lacking. When he returns home with blood on his shirt (following the accident during his morning jog) his wife attempts to help and comfort, but he doesn't say what happens and sternly brushes her off. She never tells him that she was going to allow their son to smoke pot at home. Obviously the fact that he is having an affair plays a role in their problems, but as she revealed to the psychologist 'it's not that he's (having an affair), it's that he won't tell if he was.' Ironically, it would appear that honesty and open communication will forgive his infidelity, but non-disclosure is crossing the relationship-ending line. Rush and his wife similarly have communication problems. His failure to answer the phone and simply listen to her pleas on the answering machine shows that communication between them is broken - as is the fact that he cannot look at her face while he makes love to her. Yet, her failure to completely confront Rush with here suspicions (that he's having a gay affair with one of her patients) is equally paralysing to their relationship.Interestingly, the gay patient plays two extremely important roles. First, he indicates that his married lover tells him things about his marriage that he would never tell his wife. Again, communication breakdown. Second, when he speaks about the comments made by his lover about his lover's wife, the psychologist interprets them to be comments made by her husband about her, even though we later learn that she was mistaken. Though while she was mistaken in fact (ie.. Rush was not that patient's lover), it hardly matters as we come to realise that this is the sort of honesty that Rush does not provide to his wife. In fact, when she mentions that she's having difficulty with this patient in the restaurant, his solution is refer him one. This probably reflects the dealing of problems in their marriage if it's difficult of complicated, get rid of it, disregard it, palm it off to someone else, don't confront it or solve it yourself.... just refer him on. Then there is the issue of their daughter's tragic death. This has invariably distorted the marriage to the point where it is simply held together by grief. But again - communication becomes an issue. She felt that she had to communicate her grief to the world (she wrote a book) while he was very much against it and didn't tell his wife that he frequently visited the site of their daughter's death. The communication mismatch is astounding and is why their relationship is in crisis mode. Interestingly, all this is contrasted with couple who live next door to the cop's mistress. HE's unemployed, she works long shifts, they have several children and are financially battling. All the hallmarks are there for a strained marriage. But surprisingly, this is the strongest marriage in the film. They are a loving happy couple for one reason they communicate openly. He told his wife that the neighbour invited him in for coffee after she left for work. Full disclosure keeps this marriage happy, no matter what external pressures are at play. In a way, the director is basically saying that while most people think that financial difficulties, work pressures, unemployment and so on bring down marriages, that isn't the case. Their communication keeps it alive and this is contrasted with the cop, who has a stable home-life, but their marriage is suffering due to their failure to communicate openly with each other.THE POINT The film leaves us with conflicting feelings. Rush lost his wife, the cop's mistress has not repaired her marriage with her ex, but the cop's marriage appears to survive. The fact that the cop confessed to his infidelity may have thrown his marriage off the rails temporarily, but it forced him to open up to his wife and for his wife to openly communicate with him... and at the end, it appears that they are dancing in perfect harmony - communication and disclosure of his affair actually saved their marriage.However, Rush's stirring words are just as revealing sometimes love isn't enough. This is very true when relationships encounter difficulties and obscure patches. Love will get it started and keep it going for a while, but communication breakdowns will eventually overcome the love that holds marriages together. This was what the director was trying to say in my view.

From Walkabout in 1970 via Peter Weir's pictures such as Picnic at Hanging Rock; The Last Wave and Gallipoli, right up to releases around Lantana such as The Tracker; Dirty Deeds; Rabbit-Proof Fence; Aussie Rules; The Dish and the Steve Irwin vehicle, The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course. Their appeal is partly based on an exploration of Australian culture or rather a contrast of cultures either within Australia or with the rest of the world. Like much of British Cinema, Australian Cinema has taken refuge in nationhood.Lantana is different. Although it is set in present day Sydney it could, with the exception of the film's metaphorical title, be set in any Western urban conurbation. The film does not depend on either supposed Aussie character traits or well-known locations. Postcard Sydney is eschewed in favour of suburbia and mid-town. It is also bold as, although it contains a crime detection story, the film is primarily about an interwoven set of relationships gone wrong. The police investigation does not begin until halfway through the film, and this allows the relationships to be explored in detail before the more conventional narrative begins. Leon (Anthony LaPaglia) is a morose police detective whose marriage to Sonja (the excellent Kerry Armstrong) is failing. His brief affair with Jane (Rachael Blake) in the opening sequence, is a symptom not a cause. Sonja confides her worries of the affair to Dr. Somers (Barbara Hershey), whose own relationship is soured by suspicion and tragedy. The only solid relationship is that of Jane's neighbours, whose domestic circumstances are the most difficult. This background unfolds in the first half of the film and the individual relationships are then laid over the plot allowing both an intertwining and explanation. The strength of the film is that as the characters have already been well realised, so their actions and emotions can be understood in the second half of the film. This is territory often reserved to a good novel, and is rarely brought off in the cinema and it is so well done here that a couple of narrative co-incidences can be forgiven.The lantana is a large native Australian flowering plant, whose attractive and benign appearance conceals a thorny interior. The shrub is cleverly threaded into the plot and serves as a reminder that in relationships, things might not be all they seem and that care is needed to prevent hurt. In keeping with the film's realistic style there are no feel-good resolutions but the emotional intensity carries it to an ending of some hope rather than desolation.

Valerie Somers is played by Barbara Hershey, and her husband John Knox by Geoffrey Rush. Anthony LaPaglia plays the police detective Leon Zat investigating her death. We see Valerie and John in flashbacks, showing a deteriorating relationship, and we see Leon in the present, cheating on his wife. Although none of the characters knows each other, their lives are intertwined nonetheless. It's a thicket of relationships that scratches and draws blood.LaPaglia and Rush are outstanding. John is a major suspect, as all husbands are in the deaths of their wives, and John and Leon spar as the investigation shows the bad blood between John and Valerie. We learn, finally, that John is factually innocent, but he is morally guilty of her death all the same. Leon at first sneers at John and his naked emotion, but events turn on Leon, wrenching from him his manly self esteem.This is an adult film, dealing with adult themes. No action, no gunfights, no superheroes. Just us humans muddling through. Director Ray Lawrence and writer Andrew Bovell give us much to chew over, moments of understanding, and finally acceptance of our condition.

(It's ironic that with todays special effects dominating the movies that you can see everything except the way we actually live presented on the screen).On the downside, the movie is extremely tedious, unfocussed, and ultimately clumsily constructed.  In terms of its formal structure it is pursuing the genre of intertwined short stories pioneered by Robert Altman in movies like Nashville and Short Cuts, and most specifically plays out like an Aussie Magnolia, where these intertwined stories continually intersect in coincidental fashion.Unlike Magnolia, however, the movie demonstrates little sense of humor about its use of such coincidence to drive the plot forward; everything seems to be played for melodramatic effect, so that in some respects the tone comes to resemble an American soap opera bickering families, incestuous affairs, dark secrets that are dying to get out under every roof, all interspersed with long, suffering gazes by the several protagonists.The plot feels over-constructed; the irony is that by tying things up a little too neatly the director suffocates the story with theme, and ultimately creates a film that doesn't seem to mean much of anything.  Altman, who can be credited with, if not inventing this style of filmmaking (perhaps the soap operas, after all, deserve that credit), at least with being the first to exploit it completely, understands that the chaos between the coincidence is a necessary component both in terms of realism, and in its ability to make the meaning seem organic to the situation, rather than imposed by an author.Lantana is an interesting movie, but it isn't a very good one.

The first hour is hard work as it serves up numerous disparate characters with no clear plot line.  The characters do become embroiled in the second half, however, and the story is then more engrossing.  The short sequences and the quick changes of scene and circumstance, particularly in the first half, along with the overall filming style all flatter the audience for its intelligence.  Yet what is there in this film that is intelligent?  It offers no philosophical nor any sociological insight that is not better provided in other films.  The only thing approaching insight is the wife's complaint in the central relationship that, when her husband has an affair the true betrayal is that he doesn't tell her about it.  Nothing here that you won't find in a prime time sitcom or a thousand hollywood romances.  But is it true or representative?  I doubt it.        The film proudly displays ethnic diversity amongst its characters.  But there is no ethnic diversity in their attitudes to marital behaviour and loyalty.  This is complete garbage.  More Hollywood via a cultural cringe from a non-Hollywood film.  Southern European attitudes, for example, were done much better in the Godfather series.

I will be commenting on part of the plot and should you not wish to know about the plot, read no further. In my humble opinion this film, Lantana, misused the talents of some very fine actors and actresses by impaling them with a thinly disguised soap opera that had characters as thin as tissue paper. Without knowing some of the culture of Australia, such as the importance of having a mate, which is an undeveloped theme in the movie and leaves part of the movie hanging in midair, Lantana does not appeal to a broad audience.  Here's the plot (spoiler) bit.  One character throws a woman's shoe in a tangle of bush after a night out with his mates; his wife works two jobs to keep them.  He looks after the children, except when he's out with his mates.  Sorting out the who, how, why and what of the shoe in the tangle of bush is central to sorting out one of the tangles of a mystery. And there are some very thin (in my opinion) sub-plots in a failed attempt to flesh out the characters which actually seems to confuse things without adding anything to the movie as a whole.  Had we had several previous episodes, as in a television series, in which to get to know the characters, they would have been more developed, believable, and knowable.  (There were some potentially very interesting characters in Lantana.)  Their lives and their actions may have made more sense to us with the whole of the film hanging together. Where I live we get films from all over the world and I have seen a number of Australian Australian films, so I know they can and do make good films. So do other countries.  After I have seen a movie, I usually have feelings about the movie  happiness, sadness, Why do we we exist?, What a superb film., OK, but..., So bad, it could be good., or Wow!; but seldom do I have the feeling of wondering why they even bothered.

It premiered at the 48th Sydney Film Festival in 2001, was shot on location in Sydney, Australia and is an Australian production which was produced by Australian producer Jan Chapman. It tells the story about a police officer named Leon who lives in a suburb with his wife named Sonja and their two sons. Leon and Sonja are both having concerns about their marriage and whilst Sonja talks to a psychiatrist named Valerie, Leon befriends a woman named Jane. Distinctly and precisely directed by Australian filmmaker Ray Lawrence, this rhythmic fictional tale which is narrated from multiple viewpoints, draws an invariably engaging portrayal of a cop who after beginning an affair with a woman he meets at a dancing course learns that a therapist has disappeared. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling production design by production designer Kim Buddee, cinematography by cinematographer Mandy Walker and costume design by costume designer Margot Wilson, this character-driven and narrative-driven story depicts several interrelated and refined studies of character and contains an efficient score by Australian composer Paul Kelly. This romantic, conversational and atmospheric thriller which is set in Sydney, Australia and where interpersonal relations and personalities are acutely examined and characters as poignant as the stories, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure, subtle character development, enigmatic characters, incorporation of theater in cinema and the reverent acting performances by Australian actors Anthony LaPaglia and Geoffrey Rush, Australian actresses Rachael Blake and Kerry Armstrong and American actress Barbara Hershey.

The 2001 film Lantana goes underneath the shrubs and takes a look at the lives of several couples whose lives are intertwined by the disappearance of a psychiatrist, Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey). There's a police officer Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia) who is taking dance lessons with his wife Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) and has an affair with another student, Jane (Rachel Blake); Jane's neighbors, with a husband (Manu Bennett) out of work; and the psychiatrist's own dysfunctional marriage to John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) after their daughter is murdered. When Valerie goes missing, Zat investigates, suspecting her husband. He then learns that his own wife was Valerie's client. Then Jane reports seeing her neighbor throw a woman's shoe into the underbrush.These lives intertwined stories are the fashion nowadays. There was a complaint that this film is slow. This is because filmgoers today are not used to the art of the buildup. My two favorite opposing examples of this are the classic film San Francisco, where the earthquake happens in the last half hour of the movie, and Poseidon where stock characters have a line each before the ship sinks in the first five minutes of the movie.Lantana is an intriguing film that will keep the audience wondering and guessing - does Valerie suspect her client of an involvement with her husband? How did the neighbor get the woman's shoe? Can the Zats find one another again? The three names in Lantana - LaPaglia, Hershey, and Rush - give excellent performances. It's unknown to me why LaPaglia isn't right up there with Robert de Niro. Perhaps it's his willingness or need to do television - at any rate, the dark, sad character of Zat can't possibly be being played by the same man who was Daphne's drunken Cockney cousin on Frasier! He is a magnificent actor and creates here a tortured man who loves his wife and family but has lost the ability to feel anything. His scene in the car at the end of the film is gut-wrenching. Hershey is effective as a psychiatrist forced to listen to people's problems while disturbed about her own dead marriage, and Rush's frozen face displays no emotion, yet we know he's dying inside.A really fine movie, well worth seeing. A note to you young folks - try being patient with a story that builds. "},{"Title":"Should we trust?  Can we trust?","Date":"4 January 2006","Score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" What a pleasant surprise this movie was. I knew little about it before watching it and, from the initial scene, I thought is was going to be a murder mystery. But it turns out to be an excellent psychological drama. It involves the interactions of the lives of ten people (at least that is what I counted). I found that you had to stay attentive to follow this and, in fact, I got a lot more out of it on second viewing.For example, a couple things I did not catch on first viewing was the first scene with John sitting in his car in the alley and not answering his phone (why was that scene in there and what was he doing there?), and the brief glimpse of Patrick at Valerie's talk (underlined by threatening music). There are many scenes that you come to understand only later - this movie does not insult your intelligence. And there are some hooks planted to keep your interest, like when Valerie (a psychiatrist) asks her patient Sonja if she still loves her husband and the scene lingers and finally fades before we hear the answer. And Sonja's husband ultimately listens to a tape of that session, but stops listening before he hears the answer, since he is afraid to hear it. Then toward the end, he has the courage to find out what the answer is, an answer we have been waiting for too.The movie is tightly edited and every scene is important. I particularly liked the way many small scenes were interleaved to make a whole. This kind of complex plotting is very tricky, but it works wonderfully well here.The acting is first rate. Geoffrey Rush has the ideal face and affect to realize his character's remote disconnectedness. Barbara Hershey perfectly plays the part of a psychiatrist with her own problems. Kerry Armstrong's portrayal of a woman struggling with marital conflict is astonishing - her facial expressions are nuanced and often heartrending. Never have I seen such an on-screen collection of so many sexy middle-aged women. The smaller parts are well played too - I particularly liked Detective Vat's emotionally precocious younger son in his brief scenes.There are many themes here, but the most significant one I think is trust. Valerie is torn apart and eventually dies because of her inability to trust - her inability to trust her husband, her patients, a stranger, and, ultimately, herself. In her speech at the beginning of the story she tosses out a myriad of doubts, saying that we don't know what to feel anymore, or what is right or wrong, or what to believe in. And then she adds that trust is vital to human relationships, but it is very elusive. It is certainly elusive for her, to the point that she misguidedly suspects her husband of having a homosexual affair with one of her patients. And she ultimately meets her death because of her lack of trust of a stranger who has rescued her from an accident on a lonely back road. In an ironic touch, the acknowledgment in Valerie's book about the murder of her eleven year old daughter is To John for teaching me to trust again. So often in an act of self-delusion we announce that we have conquered our demons. Valerie's husband, in his confessing to an affair in the past, says that once that's happened you're never entirely believed again - something gets broken, permanently, trust I suppose. He is a guilt-ridden unhappy man, but he is not trying to fool himself. But he is fooling his wife by not being forthcoming about anything - even the fact that he frequently visits the site of his daughter's murder. He says that the only thing keeping him and Valerie together is grief. This is clearly a marriage in trouble. Why do people continue to live in such unhappy relationships? Why does Detective Vat have a rather meaningless brief affair that risks his marriage and family? He confesses to his inamorata that he still loves his wife and she asks him, Why do you want to see me if you are still in love with your wife? And the best Vat can respond is to say, I don't know. On the flip side we have Nik and Paula, who do seem to have trust. When the evidence is pointing to Nik's having killed Valerie, his wife Paula is distressed, but when she hears Nik's denial her anxiety vanishes and is replaced by sympathy. That scene plays out in front of Detective Vat who is having trust issues in his own marriage.This movie seems to be saying that Newton's first law of motion applies to human behavior most of us continue to lumber along doing what we have always done by inertia, and it takes a major event to cause us to change direction.And I must mention the music, which is essential to the enjoyment of this movie - it sets just the proper mood at all times. I only wish I spoke Spanish so I could have understood that final song.

There are some important peripheral characters as well. The husband of the main couple is a detective going through a mid-life crisis (Anthony LaPaglia). His wife (Kerry Armstrong) knows something's wrong and is getting counseling. The marriage of the counselor (Barbara Hershey) is also troubled due to the death of their young daughter a couple of years earlier. The woman the detective is having a fling with (Rachael Blake) thinks her neighbor (Vince Colosimo) may be involved in the counselor's mysterious disappearance. This is odd because the suspect's marriage is, ironically, the only solid relationship in the story. The counselor's husband is also a suspect (Geoffrey Rush) and has insightful things to share about marriage with the brooding detective.The reason the film's called Lantana is because lantana is a tangled shrub common in Australia, which represents the entanglements of the lives of the characters. It also symbolizes marriage since lantana has a sweet but bitter smell; it's beautiful with its flowers, but has stings; its branches weave together in a complicated way and in the story a woman is caught in the complexity of it.Lantana is the antithesis of big, dumb, effects-laden blockbusters, which -- oddly enough -- often become boring with their overload of exciting things going on. Lantana effectively shows that ordinary life is more interesting and compelling, if done right. Human nature is explored through a blend of passionate emotions, misconceptions, betrayals, anger, premature conclusions, vanity, duty, ethics, honesty, loyalty and repentance.Two of my all-time favorite dramas are Grand Canyon and Snow Angels.

Lawrence directs Bovell's screenplay and the cast with confidence, and this is complemented by Walker's excellent photographic style using washed out colours and interesting lighting.Bovell's screenplay has the main characters interacting with each other through circumstance but the central story is that of La Paglia's police detective. Seeking solace from his marriage and potential heart problems, his affair with fellow salsa student is the springboard for the convoluted relationships within the story. The crime drama is merely a framework to hang the various stories of fractured relationships upon. Dr Somers, the counsellor played by Hershey, is so screwed up by the murder of her daughter she is unbalanced and paranoid. Thinking the gay client she interviews is having a relationship with her estranged husband played by Rush, she eventually ends up stranded in an isolated backwater after a car crash and when she is picked up by Nic, the neighbour of Detective Zat's lover, she believes he is about to rape her and throws herself from the car. When she fails to return home, and Nic is seen disposing of one of her shoes by Jane, Zat's lover, a full-blown murder investigation is soon underway.But this really just gives the viewer an insight to Nic's relationship with his wife, Hannah. A relationship built on trust and mutual respect. When Hannah tells Jane, her neighbour and Zat's lover, that he didn't commit the murder, Jane asks how she knows. Her reply is central to the theme of the movie, she tells Jane she knows because Nic told her he didn't do it. Their love for each other and belief in each other is very different to that experienced by the other three couples.Zat and his wife are just going through the motions, and as Sonja, Zat's wife, tells her counsellor, who happens to be Dr Somers, she wants much more from life. Detective Zat is going through his midlife crisis, unable to communicate with his wife and it is his youngest son who, by fabricating his father's response in a phone call, allows his mother to see that she still has strong feelings for her husband. And Zat's lover, Jane, eventually sees the good in her own estranged husband.So really a story about couples' relationships and the inability to be honest and share innermost feelings, but filmed through the backdrop of a crime drama.

Lantana is the first one I've seen since I started and it was also quite an interesting film, so it gets a review.Lantana (so named after a plant that features prominently in the film's Sydney setting) is half mystery, half ensemble drama. It opens with the slow revealing of a dead woman caught up in a bunch of bushes, before progressing on to the main stories.The first half of the film sets up each of the dozen or so main characters the apparent protagonist is detective Leon (Anthony LaPaglia). Although he's married to Sonja (Kerry Armstrong), he has an affair with Jane (Rachael Blake), who's currently separated from her own husband Peter (Glenn Robbins). Sonja suspects Leon's affair and confides in renowned therapist Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey). Valerie is herself having a personal crisis or two, dealing with her emotionally distant husband John (Geoffrey Rush) and the unnerving revelations of one client, a gay man named Patrick (Peter Phelps). There are more sub-plots and characters that interweave in the lives of these characters on the edge, but those are the ones that truly drive the film.The second half of the film begins when it's revealed that Valerie has disappeared. Since several characters have some connection to her, it ramps up the tension between each character to breaking point.Handling a movie with multiple sub-plots is always difficult. You only ever hear about it if the makers get it absolutely right. Lantana managed to get it right, juggling each sub-plot smoothly. The film lasts for about two hours (roughly an hour less than films of a similar breed like Magnolia or Short Cuts) and it does not drag at all. It even feature a couple of mysteries outside of the main disappearance arc (the most obvious ones including Who has Patrick been sleeping with? and What does Sonja say at the end of the therapy session?) Visually speaking, the film is brilliant. The quality see-saws from grainy to polished in such a manner that it works. The acting (comprised of several well-known Australian actors, including a surprisingly serious turn by Robbins) is top-notch. Some moments may be over-the-top, but overall it's done well and with considerable restraint. I don't remember being too impressed with the score, but I'd figure that if it was good I'd remember it.Lantana may not be the most original of films. As I outlined earlier, it's very similar to Short Cuts and Magnolia in terms of narrative, and the strength of the disappearance mystery may seem about as strong to a modern audience as the plot of the average CSI episode. However, as a whole the film works out fine. It proves to be a complex, thought-provoking meditation on the lives of overly human people that aren't necessarily bad, but just struggle to try and stay good even in the face of such extreme adversity.

Sonja is his wife who suspects Leon is having an affair but doesn't know. The sessions she spends with psychiatrist Valerie Somers at least give her an outlet. Valerie though is having her own problems with her partner John, distant and unloving since the death of their daughter. Valerie also has a patient who seems particularly aggressive towards her concerning an affair he is having. The lives of all these people touch slightly but a missing person will see them collide.I had never heard of this film when it came on the television recently but the good reviews were enough for me to have a look. Initially it had me expecting some sort of murder mystery but the material soon suggests that it will be more of a character piece and it gradually starts to become a Short Cuts type of film albeit with a more specific narrative to it. To some this will be a source of frustration because, for the first half of the film it means that we are unsure where we are meant to be going; it does a good job of developing the characters but I did wonder for what reason or direction. In the second half of the film it does introduce a narrative direction but by this point it does feel secondary to the stories of the characters that had been built up by this point.It doesn't totally hang together though because the first half feels a bit aimless, while the second half feels like the mystery is butting into the characters. That said though it is still interesting for what it does as the characters are well drawn and convincing with the theme of communication (or lack of it) common across their lives and relationships. It isn't as clever as it thinks it is though (the use of the Lantana plant is not that good a metaphor) and as a result sometimes the very slow pace can be off-putting, with scenes drifting then vaguely fading out. The characters are interesting enough and strong enough to just about keep the interest but again I understand why some viewers bail out of it &#150; there isn't enough here to fill the time when it delivers it so slowly. The cast help fill it out though as they respond to the characters and the inner feelings there are asked to deliver without a lot of words. LaPaglia, Armstrong, Hershey, Rush and Blake all work well together and individually.An interesting film then that works off the back of engaging characters and relationships. Not the masterpiece that some claim though because it is not as complex nor as clever as it would like to think it is and I can understand why some viewers are left cold by it. Subtle and interesting though, even if it requires a lot of patience on the surface and below.

His reply things aren't always what they seem. If I had to choose a main theme for this smart Australian film it might be the hidden secrets that normal adults carry around with them, the appearances which often belie the reality. This movie about the intertwining lives around a missing woman is ostensibly classified as a thriller. And while there is a death and a police investigation, this is really more a study of suburban lives. It's what passes in the UK and New South Wales as a drama. I won't go into plot here, it's complex--though not too complex--and to do so would spoil the fun of discovery, but I will say that the elements of this film all hold together to keep you involved in the story. This is a small film, made up of telling moments in peoples' lives and held together by odd connections between the characters' lives, much like those in Robert Altman's Short Cuts, though this story has a tighter weave than anything Altman made. No, there are no car chases or stolen microfilm, and the love affairs in it seem labored and unhappy. The pace of the film is leisurely but not slow, and the musical score is moody and haunted, much like the characters' lives. I guess this is what you'd call a grown up (I hesitate to use the term adult, since that has other unwanted connotations) drama about people with adult/grown-up problems. Their lives have kids and spouses and soon to be ex-spouses and problems they didn't expect. So much of current US film output are dramas that seem comic book and aimed at 18 to 24 year old males.

There was a time when nobody familiar with movies knew anything about Australia except that that's where Chips Rafferty came from.  You could tell by his accent.  He was Hollywood's Australian.  Then, somewhere around twenty years ago, there was rather suddenly, The Last Wave, a big surprise.  Since then we've been deluged with Australian movies, good and bad, mostly good.This is one of the better ones.  Superficially it's a story about a shrink, Barbara Hershey, who disappears in the woods around Sydney, and whose body is finally recovered.  What it's really about is a bit more obscure but has most to do with the nature of the bonds that keep people who are living together from drifting apart.  Beyond that, and I'm kind of guessing, it has to do with middle-age life crises and raises questions like, What's it all about?It's divided into two parts.  The first resembles the first part of a disaster movie in its structure.  A half dozen or so people get to know one another without always realizing that some of the people they know, know other people they know.  The shrink provides a sociometric pivot for these relationships.  The individuals are pretty well sketched in.  All of the performances are quite good, but I need to mention Kerry Armstrong as outstanding.  She tells the shrink that she's worried that her husband might be having an affair (he is) and that she's afraid of being deserted, what with her new wrinkles and all that.  Watch her response when her husband the cop sits next to her at a table in the back yard and tells her he doesn't want to lose her.  It's a finely tuned piece of work.  And like Rachel Blake, her husband's lover, she accomplishes a great deal without being startlingly beautiful.  But then no one in the movie is truly beautiful.  They look a lot like the rest of us.Halfway through, the shrink disappears, and the cop and his part-Native assistant conduct the investigation.  This leads to his interrogation of his lover, her husband, their neighbors, and the shrink's husband, all of whom have problems that have been earlier explored.  There isn't much suspense.  Everyone comes together in one way or another.  The body is discovered but the cause of death isn't explained.  Presumably the death was accidental.  Perhaps she tripped in the woods and fell onto some of those strange spikey growths in the darkness.  If the cause of death isn't clearly explicated, neither is the cause of life.  What's it all about?  Schopenhauer compared living to walking.  You put one foot in front of the other in order to keep from falling on your face.  The movie closes with shots of each set of characters.  The cop's ex-lover dances at home by herself.  The cop and his wife are hugging each other and weeping.  The neighbors are playing happily with their kids.  The shrink's husband stands alone on a cliff looking out to sea.It takes a while to get going, of course.  If we didn't know the airplane was going to crash in the disaster movie it would be difficult to sit and listen to the passengers tell their stories to one another.  There's no disaster here, just the stories, but the stories glow with verisimilitude, whereas the stories on the doomed airplane are simply stupid.  This is well done, and worth sticking with.

The central theme of this well-written film is whether those who have made mistakes will be punished. Of what are the characters guilty? And then how to identify who is innocent since everyone appears to have done something of which they are ashamed? This film will keep you guessing, but in a manner not found in the standard mystery or formula crime drama.So, it is not really a mystery, although there is a dead body, betrayal, suspects are identified and questioned, everyone has something to hide, and there is more than enough punishment. Rather the film is a commentary on the state of marriage and the inability of two very close individuals to really understand each other, communicate, and trust. Does marriage automatically lead to suspicion? Can truth only be shared with strangers? Do we see the best in our partners or the worst? Hence the title of the play on which this film is based `Speaking in Tongues.' Yet the story has been re-written and re-titled for the film. A lantana is a tropical shrub with small, colorful, aromatic blooms that hides in dense, thorny undergrowth found throughout Australia. So did the producer think that this botanical metaphor more aptly describes marriage and our ability to get to the best in social relationships? Or is the flower the ring in the entangled spiky vine of marriage?Multi-layered storytelling about four decaying and dysfunctional married couples who are intertwined and at one time or another paranoid and attempting to atone. The actors do a very good job in portraying their non-Ozzie and Harriet characters but surely Anthony LaPaglia stands out as a numb/violent police detective who falls from grace out of boredom, as does Kerry Armstrong his not-so noble wife. Another believable character is the female psychiatrist (Barbara Hershey) whose life touches all the others and whose disappearance is the organizing mechanism for the storyline. Which couple is the most functional one will surprise and lead to discussions that last for hours beyond the screening of the film.Highly recommended &#150; and shame on the industry for not promoting this excellent film and instead telling us that we should all like Gosford Park.

He is a cop on the edge. Nothing new here, but the movie decides to show us how his personal life is falling apart rather than show us his life as a cop.

Rather than to let out his emotions on the floor he decides to go for the bed. Less artistry, less energy, less personal.The other main character is played by Barbara Hershey, a tense Psychiatrist who can't see that she's projecting her own insecurities on to the story of a patient. She's decided to shelve grieving for her murdered daughter by publishing a best selling book about it. Her husband, a marvelously lifeless Geoffry Rush, grieves privately, almost in rebellion against his wife's publication of their pain.

For me Lantana never developed enough steam to iron a hankie, let alone keep me engaged for approx 2 hours. It chose to allow it's characters to internalise ad nauseam. Like LaPaglia's character I began to feel numb midway through this flick, making furtive glances at my watch to see how much time had elapsed.To be honest I felt no empathy for his character. A burnt out cop having a mid life crisis. Please!!! Spare me the clichés. Maybe if there had been some progression in the character but no. We discover he feels numb with no explanation as to why. His character appears to undergo no journey as such, however miraculously at the end of the film it's happy families. Give me a break!!And what an original device, using the psychologist. Gee, do you reckon the writer might have seen an episode of two of the Sopranos? Then there's a scene where LaPaglia hugs a fellow jogger who wails cathartically. Wanky new age dross at it's finest. And what's the story when Hershey yells out at the character of Pete in the street for no apparent reason? No doubt she has some deep and meaningful motivation for such action like the rest of the characters.I admit I have a low tolerance for films like this that take themselves so damn seriously. There's one scene where LaPaglia tells 'a friend' repeatedly that she shouldn't have picked up a piece of evidence and it's very funny. Pity the whole piece wasn't lightened up more. I actually thought the crime plot as it was was quite good. It's a pity that it was treated as an after thought near the end of the film. It's not a crime to introduce a plot earlier in a film you know.I thought Latana was visually impressive and I actually enjoyed most of the performances, in spite of their generally angst ridden states. Personally I'd nominate Rachel Blake as the pick of the performers. Hopefully she can pop up again in another movie soon.

Ostensibly a thriller, it is, in essence, a psychological drama about a number of middle-aged married couples whose paths cross and who are experiencing various degrees of marital and family difficulties. Set in what seems to be small-town Australia but is, in fact, a suburb of Sydney (judging by what is said in a news broadcast about one of the pivotal incidents of the plot), the story features a policeman, Leon Zat (brilliantly portrayed by Anthony LaPaglia). Zat is slap bang in the middle of a mid-life crisis. He is having an affair with a woman named Jane (Rachael Blake), who is separated from her husband. He has symptoms of possible coronary problems; he is violent towards suspects; and he is angry towards his wife, Sonja (Kerry Armstrong), and sometimes towards his lover. In one telling scene, he accidentally collides with a jogger in the street and loses his top with him before realising that he has overreacted. Sonja is seeing an American relationship counsellor, Valerie (Barbara Hershey), who is married to John (Geoffrey Rush). Valerie and John's marriage has been in difficulty since the death of their daughter a few years ago. It seems that Valerie suspects that John may be having a relationship with a gay man whom she is counselling. When Valerie herself disappears after her car breaks down late at night, suspicion falls on one of Jane's neighbours, Nik, who is happily married to Paula, with whom Jane has a good friendship. These interrelated stories form a credible plot that skilfully examines the emotional turbulence and pitfalls experienced by many people who are in their forties and which at the same time provides an entertaining puzzle. The acting in Lantana is superb. The screenplay is, for the most part, plausible (there is perhaps a slight over-reliance on coincidence in the way in which the lives of the principal characters intersect). It is also beautifully written. All of the characters are believable and fully fleshed out. The direction and the cinematography are first rate. And the soundtrack, which is primarily made up of Buena Vista Social Club-style Cuban dance music, is very entertaining. Lantana is an intelligent and entertaining film. 9/10. There is one slight mystery about the film. I may have missed something but I do not understand the reason for its title. Wikipedia suggests that lantana is a genus of a perennial flowering plant that is common in the Australian-Pacific region. But quite what that has to do with the film, even one whose opening scene is of a camera panning through a plantation that hides the limbs of a dead woman's body, is not immediately clear (to me, at least).

Lantana is ostensibly a mystery-drama about the disappearance of a psychiatrist, Barbara Hersey, that is investigated by a flawed-but-not-bad cop, Anthony LaPaglia. The movie creates almost half a dozen truly believable characters with very real motivations and actions. Unfortunately, that in and of itself does not a great movie make. The 'mystery' isn't all that interesting and really just serves as a way to connect all the characters. Each of the characters is dealing with some kind of emotional trauma that is causing them difficulty - the cheating cop, the psychiatrist whose child died, the cop's frustrated and lonely wife, the desperate 'other woman'. Again though, their traumas while believable just aren't all that interesting. So, in the end a half dozen fabulous performances are for naught as the script leaves their characters without a single memorable moment. The film never really builds tension or drama, as the facts are revealed we are neither shocked or disappointed - very... blah. A movie I doubt I'll remember in a few days time.

This is a film about trust. Lantana builds its premise and focus around characters that are untrustworthy, that have no reason to be trusted, and finally asks us to forget what we think we know or have heard to discover a killer among them. We are given strangers. Strangers, like in Anderson's Magnolia, are twisted together haphazardly in hopes that their random stories will bring the film closure as well as evoke a conversation about trust around the office water-cooler. What transforms Lantana from classic noir film to another chatty film with a disappointing conclusion is the misdirection of the characters. Lantana boasts amazing acting, and it did just that. Lantana boasted a mystery that needed to be solved, and it did just that. Lantana boasted flawed characters which would evoke emotion, and it did just that. The issues begin as the film nears the center that these elements, while good on their own, do not allow for a strong enough overall film. The confusing circumstances that reach sporadically at the weak threads of this film are painful to watch, and will eventually transform an avid viewer into a dulled participant.Where did Anthony LaPaglia come from? Sure, I had seen him in other films like Empire Records and The Salton Sea and the television series Without A Trace, but it wasn't until this film was I able to witness his true acting ability. After watching Lantana, I must admit, LaPaglia needs to get more work. While I didn't see him as the center of this film (that goes to Hershey's character), I did think that he out shined even the great Geoffrey Rush. He was intense and intimidating while powerfully giving us a very conflicted human character. Rush was my second favorite of the film, his toned performance gave me goosebumps as I questioned his motives and logic. Hershey was adequate. Her character provided very little (outside of the central plot) and required even less. Her chemistry was disjoined, while her delivery seemed unmotivated. The same could be said for most the other characters outside of Rush and LaPaglia. These two tremendous actors stapled the film, while the rest seemed to simply move the plot closer to the ending credits.With such powerful acting, why didn't this movie succeed in my mind? For me, it was the flawed story. Director Ray Lawrence needed to define this film better. What was the overall message? Was it sympathy for our characters or was it an entire film about the power of trust? I could see both, but they were blurry. It was obvious that trust was the underlying moment in Lantana, but it was so blazingly pushed in your face that it became tedious quickly. I see the value of building distrust around your central characters only to demonstrate the power of trust overall, but in this film it just didn't work. Lawrence's pacing destroyed any chances of this being a strong theme. From the beginning we are pushed with this idea of trust in so many main directions such as Leon's adultery, the flirtatious neighbor, the openly gay affair, and the death of a child, that when it is provided to us in short verse, aka the son smoking weed and the wife's confused moment in the car, it just seemed overwhelming. I needed, alas wanted, a stronger story. I did not want to have to wait for nearly an hour for the plot-point to happen. Lawrence painfully made us wait, under developing characters that we fully understood early in the film, and focusing lengthily on minute details, forgetting the overall picture that this film could have accomplished.Lantana had every element for success. The emotional characters, the Magnolia connection, a disturbing murder, a plant (actually a weed) that only waxed the surface of symbolism; these were all synonymous with success, but Lawrence could not put the puzzle pieces together with ease. It nearly drives you to the brink of madness when you realize that everything was in place, it was the mind behind the camera that could not control it. I wanted the story to work, the characters were engrossing enough, I just felt that overall the haphazard themes and overplayed obstacle of trust was just chaotic. There wasn't enough rhythm, there wasn't enough balance, and there wasn't enough honest connections to make Lantana worth a second viewing. One scene the immediately comes to mind was that when LaPaglia was running down his street and accidentally hits a random stranger. Later, we learn that person is not as random as we thought, but by that point our apathy towards the film is already in full swing. Director Ray Lawrence tried to mimic what Paul Thomas cornered in Magnolia, but the end result was like tasting boxed wine instead of vintage.Grade ** out of ***** "},{"Title":"The Dingo Ate Your Unfaithful Spouse!","Date":"14 January 2006","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" When you initially read a brief description on the movie, it appears as if it is going to be a thrilling mystery.

The movie is built around the disappearance of a local Australian psychiatrist, but the events leading up to it and the relationships that are created and destroyed surrounding the psychiatrist (Barbara Hershey) prove to be much more valuable to the final fifteen minutes of the movie. The movie comes full-circle at the end and there are various underlying themes that make you appreciate the ending while being mildly disappointed.

The plot was dragging horribly, dialogues were weak as hell, stupid coincidences aplenty, predictable scenes, really, I've nearly left in the middle...Every one of the characters seemed like weak, overreacting wretch, too consumed with their own emotions to live, to me. Some say because it was so stuffed with inner tensions and lusts, that's why the story was so true and appealing and I don't know what else. But truly I didn't find the behavior of the characters that realistic and true...And anyway, people are weak and pathetic sometimes, we're all only humans after all, but that's not reason to amplify that and put it on tape. Not for me. I really had no fun with Lantana...And my final point. The tagline reads 'love is the greatest mystery'. How this film puts it, I find nothing mysterious about it. You neglect to care of what you've got and start caring when it's gone or on its way there. It's not mysterious, seems like normal or logical to me.

Although the film involves a murder, the story is more the exploration of a number of interconnected relationships.The film starts with a woman's body lying in a lantana bush, but we don't know who it is until the end. The story builds up to that point, and centres on a quartet of families starting with Leon Zat (Anthony La Paglia), a police detective, and his wife Sonja (Kerry Armstrong).Lantana, the title of the film, refers to the noxious weed that grows like crazy and eventually strangles and entangles everything else in the garden &#x96; it's the perfect metaphor for the way all the various relationships are being strangled and entangled by infidelity, deception and unhappiness.The structure of the film is similar to Robert Altman's Short Cuts where different stories intersect at critical times.Although the film has a sense of mystery, I found Lantana just too serious and humourless. Unlike Short Cuts, there really isn't a light touch in the whole thing. Anthony La Paglia's Leon Zat makes the characters played by Nicholas Cage seem deliriously happy by comparison. I am also wary in Australian movies of scenes set in psychiatrist's offices; it often allows the 'meaningful' dialogue to be delivered in very large chunks.After a while, for me at any rate, the interconnectivity &#x96; where no meeting is random &#x96; comes across as just a little too laboured. What saves Lantana is that everyone plays it low-key &#x96; the actors give the movie class.The brilliant Barbara Hershey has competition for attention from two other women Kerry Armstrong and Rachael Blake. Kerry Armstrong is one of the most interesting actors in Australian film and television, and she ages beautifully.The film steps up a notch when the mystery kicks in about halfway through, and it becomes partly a police procedural.Lantana was loved up by the critics and won every Australian film award going at the time it was released. It is the sort of smart, multi-layered film that the cognoscenti could discuss at some length over lattes on Sunday morning.The film is well made and the acting is flawless, but it seems interminably stretched out, an effect aided by the chilled out score. My main problem with Lantana is that it seems to self-consciously scream out How clever is my script? I can see the gears turning.

Upon first glance, 'Lantana' seems like nothing more than a straightforward drama, rife with melodramatic coincidences and with an ordinate amount of time spent on characters rambling about all of their personal problems. A second viewing, however, proves 'Lantana' to be decidedly more than just that; while an ensemble piece, LaPaglia's jaded detective is always at the forefront of the film, and as he is asked don't you just want to cry sometimes? along the way and then later that told that most men hold something back, the film really becomes about LaPaglia experiencing some sort of wakening inside and coming to reevaluate what he is doing by cheating on his wife and taking her for granted. That said, the supporting characters are quite fascinating too; Kerry Armstrong has a very strong turn as LaPaglia's wife, while Geoffrey Rush and Barbara Hershey hold a lot of interest in how differently they react to their preteen daughter's death. The film's promotional tagline - sometimes love isn't enough - comes from something Rush says about his own marriage, and all of the relationship drama in the film (not only between LaPaglia and Armstrong) seems to revolve around this paradigm in a sense. The couples in the film are brought together by love, but some of them - just some of them - feel like they need something more. "},{"Title":"Haunting, Realistic & Subtle","Date":"26 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" The lives of a number of married couples are put under the microscope in this drama that focuses on the emotional distances that develop between husbands and wives. Infidelity, grief and a lack of trust are just some of the reasons for such problems and their inability to communicate successfully is identified as the biggest single barrier to them resolving their issues. The typical tendency for women to want to talk things through and for men to keep everything bottled up is at the heart of their communication problems and the pain, despondency and heartache caused is absolutely immeasurable.Screenwriter Andrew Bovell's adaptation of his own stage play Speaking In Tongues is well-written, intelligent and thoroughly absorbing to watch and director Ray Lawrence's sensitive pacing is perfect for this type of material.When a woman's dead body is discovered in some bushes in a suburban area of Sydney, Australia, detective sergeant Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia) is assigned to the case and his investigation brings him into contact with a series of people whose lives are all connected (directly or indirectly) with each other.Leon is depressed, overweight and in the throes of a mid-life crisis that has made him feel totally numb. In order to try to feel something again, he has a one-night-stand (which happens twice!!) with Jane O'May (Rachael Blake) who's separated from her husband and disappointed when her assignation with Leon fails to develop into an affair. Leon's neglected wife Sonia (Kerry Armstrong) suspects that he may be cheating on her and consults psychiatrist Dr Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) to try to come to terms with her predicament.Valerie's got troubles of her own as she's been consumed with grief for the last couple of years since the murder of her young daughter and her attempt to ameliorate the situation by writing a book about the experience hasn't brought her any closure. To make matters worse, her marriage with John (Geoffrey Rush) has also become dysfunctional and she's started to suspect that he may be having an affair with her gay client, Patrick Phelan (Peter Phelps) who she finds difficult to deal with because of his unpleasant attitude.Jane's neighbours, Nik (Vince Colosimo) and Paula D'Amato (Daniella Farinacci) struggle to get by but have the type of trusting relationship that Jane envies. One night, when she sees Nik throw a woman's shoe into the bushes where the dead body was found, she reports the matter to the police and this puts Nik in the frame for the woman's murder. This, however, doesn't provide Leon with a simple conclusion to his investigation.This story of complicated relationships is haunting, realistic and subtle in the way that it's presented and captures beautifully the quiet despair of ordinary suburban people who are trying to cope with their problems whilst also having to meet the routine demands of their daily lives. Top class performances (especially from LaPaglia and Hershey) and some beautiful photography complement the melancholy mood of the piece perfectly and there are also a couple of Edward Hopper inspired scenes when Leon meets Jane's estranged husband in a bar and in a kitchen where he has a conversation with his sidekick Claudia (Leah Purcell). Overall, Lantana is a thoughtful and serious movie with well-developed characters that'll resonate most strongly with mature audiences.

Only seeing his recent work for American cop shows, I never thought of La Paglia as such a sincere actor. A clever and unexceptional narrative strings these characters together nicely.What the movie teaches us is that we are more normal than we think we are. And that we make things complicated though deceiving ourselves and others, through refusing to reflect on our relationships, and through being quiet.If the academic talked sincerely with his wife about their daughter, he wouldn't be alone with his grief, and his wife wouldn't have misconceptions about his situation. If Nick was more honest and forward with the woman he picked up, and with the police, the main problem of the movie would have been avoided.

The characters manipulated by their psyches and their interactions with each other and us by masterful acting/film making.

Sometimes this is a good thing and that's generally the case here.Here we have Anthony LaPaglia as the cop, Leon Zat. He's not having the best social life - cheat on the wife, having a small midlife crisis. He's seeing a shrink for his problems . and around this operates certain other characters, such as the gay man troubled by the married man he is seeing. All these stories seem somewhat disparate and unconnected but, much like say `Magnolia', they all meet and overlap around a certain point in an amusing fashion. It's reasonably smart, although some of the twists are fairly well sign-posted and lose their surprise/humour value (although there is one thoroughly enjoyable one which had me fooled).What `Lantana' is mostly about is characters. It's a character piece, with a few elements of drama strapped around to propel itself along. Characters depend on a dual combo of decent acting and script and fortunately `Lantana' provides both qualities. The protagonists are chiefly men, making this movie an exploration of male value systems. This can be quite funny, thanks to a sharp script. There's a wonderful dialog where one man says how he wants to cry now and then, and the other replies perfectly, `Yeah but you don't, do you?' Brilliant. None of the characters are one-dimensional, and they even manage to achieve an unusual three-dimensional aspect. They feel like people you can really meet - sometimes sad, sometimes happy, sometimes lost and confused. That allows the audience to relate to them, a key element in a character movie. As the characters develop (or as they do not), we feel we're getting to empathise with humans, rather than a three line summary of a human that Hollywood often delivers to us. There's some nuances that are both script based and actor delivered, and it all works well.`Lantana' is not a wonderful movie, in the sense there's not enough plot always and the plot itself has some unfortunate forced coincidences. It is however a refreshing break from the turgid deliveries festered upon us by Hollywood's machine. With a good script, good acting, and an ability to portray people, I'll give it my recommendation. 8/10.

The strength of Australian film making is in the realistic portrayal of human beings; we don't tend to glorify people nor do we demonise them, at our best we show nuts and bolts characters. It isn't the best film of it's genre, but then again does it need to be with the superb quality of acting and casting? Full marks for an excellent Kerry Armstrong, her acting was top notch. Slowish, I grant you, but relax and let the film's subtleties wash over you.

Australian decency I would say. The plot brings to screen a group of Sidney people - policemen, psychiatrist, professor, nurse, un-employed - none of them very happy with his or her life, trying to find surrogates in stolen relationship. A crime seems to happen (did it?) and bring together all the characters, but they already have been connected through a net of coincidence (not always very credible).The beauty of the film lies in the development of the characters and the detailed approach of the study of the relationships. There is a murder story here, but it is just the pretext. The film is built of short scenes, but the pace is not in the action, it lies rather in what the heros do and how their feelings and relations develop. Amazingly, this melancholic drama ends by leaving an optimistic message.Though this film is probably too heavy for the average commercial cinema viewers, it will be enjoyed by those who look for true characters and good drama.

Like unintentional voyeurs, we observe the intimate details and secrets of the disjointed group, as the detective assigned to investigate the mystery does his work.  Individually commonplace, together they are a fascinating comparative study of long-term relationships  the trouble they get into, the trouble they get out of, and the inevitable slow death of others.  The private details of the group become urgently relevant as the investigator, one of the four married men, illegally examines the psychiatrist's professional documents.  Intuitively acting on what he knows to be true about his own marriage -- emotional disconnection and waning affection behind the appearance or normalcy -- he projects his own issues onto the others, though not without some justification. The skill with which Lantana handles these relationships, and the emotional depth of the characters -- especially the men -- is a far cry from typical Hollywood productions, which either portray infidelities and deceits as irrevocably evil and debauched, or as entirely justified by fate and circumstance.  The investigating detective, for example, is in many ways a typical adult male, keen on objective facts, but dull to emotional subtleties;  so, he bangs his way through the investigation, missing obvious signs and clues, which only become apparent to him toward the end of the investigation.  There are no heroes or heroines in this film, just people making common mistakes, and common discoveries;  however, they are unique in the sense that they all, like the rest of us, must discover these things in the first person, for themselves.  Best of all, Lantana deals incisively with the problem of emotional honesty, suggesting that the way through the inevitable marital difficulties is by being true to oneself, and to one's significant other, as regards one's feelings.  This is modeled for the detective, and the audience, by one of the four couples.  Their trust has been nurtured on a steady diet of gut-level honesty.  What I love about this couple is that, to the person who makes surface evaluations, they seem to be anything but exemplars. What a great movie.

Yes, what we do in our personal relationships does impinge on other people, and on the world at large.

Based on the play by Andrew Bovall, the film is a psychological murder mystery that avoids most of the Hollywood gloss and predictability and leaves the viewer with four intriguing couples whose lives intertwine in a surprising way. Not unlike `In the Bedroom', this film deals with a couple (Geoffrey Rush and Barbara Hershey) whose lives are ravaged by the loss of a child and their subsequent doubts about each other. Although not nearly as depressing, the focus shifts to another couple (Anthony LaPaglia and Kerry Armstrong) dealing with the loss of love and trust. The unexpected twists and turns in the characters' development makes for many surprises and keeps the viewer guessing the whole movie.The `murder mystery' tag simply comes from the opening scene, where an unidentified dead body is shown. However, it doesn't become apparent who it might be until towards the end, which keeps the thought in the back of your mind most of the time. The main focus is the relationships, and like the tango classes that two of the couples take, show how hard some people try at some things to make them work. Already a winner of numerous Australian awards, this film is worth going to check out if you enjoy smart independent films.

Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren for bit roles?  Please!   Lantana is not an amazing film.  What it is is an honest drama, that feels utterly without the pretense and direness of Ice Storm or American Beauty.  Unlike the disappointing but visually staggering Royal Tenenabums, Lantana is clearly made by a director who knows how to work with actors. (SPOIILERS) You really do believe in watching the film that Leon Zat could be such a screw-up and still be in love with his wife.  You do believe that Geoffrey Rush's character could have just stood in the kitchen while his wife pleaded for him to come to her rescue.   Heck, you could even see how Dr. Sommers would begin to suspect her husband of cheating on her, despite no evidence besides body language, or how Kerry Armstrong's character could go and make out with a barely legal kid and then change her mind mid way through.  Frailty, foibles, fear, very honestly portrayed.  Ray Lawrence really does a great job of keeping the tone honest, neither absolutely dire like the Ice Storm, or weepy like American Beauty.  In the end, you don't need a speech or a final coda.  Just the sight of a couple looking each other in the eye and dancing shows a bit of hope, and a victory for trust.    My only complaint (not a big thing, since this was the first film for a lot of the crew) is that Lantana's look, editing, and cinematography create the feeling of watching a television show that was put on the big screen.  It had that faded-out cold cinematography that you're used to seeing on the BBC shows and Prime Suspect, where grimy green and gray seem to take over every scene.  That's wise for a police procedural, but the cop story here seems merely incidental to the larger plot.

The only criticism I have of the film is that The Method is a tad overused, in the sense that a lot of the early dialogue is inaudible. Let's face it, it's a drag to strain to hear the words, and the temptation is to tune out rather than look to non-verbal cues to follow the characterizations. Expressions are important, but, (yawn,) language has its charms, too, as the great screenwriter of Lantana would attest. Eventually the diction sharpens, and the film picks up accordingly. The editing and music are expertly utilized to propel the convoluted comedy/farce/tragedy forward, and the director brilliantly brings all the players together in a masterful way. It's not too far a stretch to compare Lantana to a symphony of relationships that is totally satisfying...with the actors the instruments expertly led by an original and talented conductor. Wouldn't surprise me a bit to learn if that's his hobby, outside of directing. I highly recommend Lantana. Relationships aren't easy, to summarize sometimes funny, sometimes desperate, sometimes evanescent, but always, they're the only things that make life interesting or even worth living. This film is music to my ears...and eyes. A truly unique and wonderful composition. Oh, by the way, the accents of the actors will keep you wondering just where Lantana really is. ) "},{"Title":"EXCELLENT","Date":"14 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Absolutely loved this movie.

"},{"Title":"The Australian In the Bedroom","Date":"4 February 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  Perhaps it is more appropriate to call In the Bedroom the American Lantana because in many respects Lantana is the superior film.  Both films deal in depth with male/female relationships, including a love triangle and with a homicide as the plot focal point.  Both films also use a flower motif -- violets and lantana respectively.  Lantana benefits from highly effective and tight direction (not a shot is wasted) driven by an intelligent, intriguing script (nothing is what it appears to be) with sparkling dialogue (This isn't an affair.  This is a one-night-stand twice).  Neither the male nor female characters are stereotypical; all four principle couples are realistically drawn with both good qualities and flaws.  Neither men nor women are portrayed as villains.  The performances are uniformly strong which is a further sign of Ray Lawrence's fine direction.  This is a film for both men and women; it is definitely not a chick flick which it could easily have been.The film begins with a shot of an unidentified body of a woman who has obviously met a violent death and the viewer begins to expect a murder mystery.  However, the story quickly focuses on the daily lives of four couples Leon Zat (a police detective) and Sonja Zat (his frustrated wife); John Knox (dean of a law school) and Valerie Somers (his psychiatrist wife); Jane O'May, and her estranged husband, Pete; and Jane's next door neighbors, the unemployed Nik Daniels and his hard-working wife Paula.  All the while, you have the image of the woman's corpse in the back of your mind.  Each of the relationships is dysfunctional to some degree.  Sonja has dragged Leon to dance class in hope of exciting some passion between them; instead, he meets Jane and becomes passionate with her.  Jane invites Nik in for a morning coffee and Paula becomes hostile and jealous. Valerie begins to suspect that her husband is having an affair with one of her clients.Later, the identity of the dead woman is revealed as the story logically unfolds.  Leon begins an investigation that intertwines all four couples and the outcome of which changes all of their lives -- some for the better and some for the worse.  The underlying theme of the film is trust. (Ironically, Valerie has dedicated her book about her dead daughter to her husband, John who taught her to trust.)  Those relationships that find trust survive and bloom like the lantana flower with its beautiful red blossoms growing out of bramble bushes. Those that lack trust wither and die.As the story develops and the characters change, your perceptions change and you are intrigued.  Nothing is what it seemed to be at first.  There are no gimmicks -- no virtual reality and no blending of dreams with reality -- just changing perceptions as in real life where perception shapes reality. Ray Lawrence and his writer Andrew Bovell have successfully blended the mystery and adult romance genres in a way that may become a trendsetter and that will not soon be forgotten.

Anthony LaPaglia plays the film's leading character, Detective Leon Zat, whose life is turned upside down after a brief fling. LaPaglia gives an aching, compassionate performance. There are many other winning performances. As Detective Zat's brief fling Rachel Blake is charismatic and eye catching as Jane O'May. Kerry Armstrong is good as Zat's insecure wife, Sonja.Barbara Hershey is an anguished soul as psychiatrist Valerie Summers who suspects her husband of having an affair. Geoffrey Rush gets exactly the right tone as her reserved, cold fish husband. Peter Phelps is all edginess and swarminess as Somers' gay client, Patrick Phelan.

Instead Lantana is a very talky yet effective relationship film (yes, chick flick) about four couples including a police officer (Anthony Lapaglia) investigating a missing persons case in Australia.There's a lot of sex in this film, though no nudity. This is like eating cereal without milk. Yes, it can be tasty, even nutritious, but its much better with milk.As far as chick flicks go, this is not bad. The women are all fine and none of the men are blubbering simps. Geoffrey Rush (who almost always appears naked in his films) and the timelessly beautiful Barbara Hershey (I loved her in Boxcar Bertha) are the intellectual couple who lost a child to a killer several years ago. Hershey has written a book about it, which Rush resents. Lapaglia's marriage with the muy cutito Kerry Armstrong has lost something, and he has a one night stand with an attractive divorcée (Rachel Blake) in his salsa dance class (the music in this film had me dancing the lambada in the aisle on several occasions). The divorcée happens to live next door to a personable young couple (Daniella Forinacci and Vince Colosimo). She works as a nurse, he stays home with the kids. Filling out the cast is a gay man having an affair with a married man, and Lapaglia's female partner (Leah Purcell) who has a crush on a man she's never actually met.When Lapaglia is called in to investigate the missing person, all these worlds intersect (okay, more than a bit unlikely, but it is handled well, and doesn't come across like a poke in the eye). The emotions and circumstances seem real and never phony.Lantana is not a lord of the rings kind of boffo blockbuster, or mainstream studio release. But it is an enjoyable (though perhaps not all that memorable) story of adults trying to follow their hearts in a relationship cloudy world.By the way, a lantana is a shrub. "},{"Title":"Sometimes love isn't enough","Date":"27 December 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  When I saw Lantana, I had only heard about it days before and that it was an exceptional Australian film. Well the people that told me this were right. I walked out of the cinema, slightly down, but content with what I saw. There is no doubting that Lantana is a depressing sort of film, yet it challenges, intrigues, mystifies, moves and makes the viewer think about what is important about life.Leon Zat  is a police detective who is cheating on his wife, Sonja, with Jane O'may. Jane who is separated from her husband Pete, lives next door to Paula and Nik, a happily married couple who become entwined in the events of Jane and Pete. Sonja who senses her husband alienation is seeing a psychiatrist Valerie Summers, who is married to academic, John Knox.  Their relationship is marred by the death of their daughter. The film opens with the dead body of a woman in the midst of lantana scrub and it is Leon's investigation of this event that connects everyone, including one of Valerie's patients, Patrick Phelan, a rather strange and nasty guy.The cast of Lantana is one of the strong points of this film. The main role of Leon, was played by veteran Australian actor, Anthony LaPaglia. I really felt pain in some instances for his character, yet in other circumstances there was no other feeling than `you deserve it Pal'. He really played the role of the cheating and guilty husband to perfection. While his co-star and onscreen wife, Kerry Armstrong was very strong as Sonja. She has recently won awards for her role in the Australian TV drama, Sea Change.Other characters worthy of a mention, include Rachel Blake as the woman on the side for Leon and the next door neighbour who is just a little too concerned about other people's affairs, while her husband is played by the goofy Glen Robbins, who is a really funny man. I also enjoyed the roles of Valerie and John. John was played by academy award winner Geoffery Rush, who is nothing short of brilliant in this movie. His portrayal of the grieving father is exceptional. While Barbara Hershey stars as Valerie, the psychiatrist who is need of counselling of her own, because of her daughter's death. The pair show how hard it is to be a normal couple after such a traumatic experience from the loss of a child. In addition, the role of Patrick Phelan, played by Aussie actor Peter Phelps, was extremely refreshing as you really do think that he is not such a great guy, from the situation he is in therapy with Valerie. This film also gives the audience a great look at the difficult situations one can be in from a relationship. You need to have a lot of trust, honesty and respect for each other, otherwise things will not work out, whether you are married or not. This film also gives a great perspective on the other side of an affair, the guilty side. No-one wins from an affair, because the hurt and betrayal causes  all sorts of problems, including the effects on family, work environment, friends and personal well-being. This film certainly allows you to experience what it is like to have an affair and how you can be hurt by one.  This film is the work of director Ray Lawrence, who has done one other film in his time named Bliss. I like the story that he had to work with and how he used the city of Sydney to great effect. I hope that we get to see more of Lawrence's work because the movie going public has waited a long time to see an Australian film of such high quality. This film might even give the Hollywood studios a good look at what a talent Lawrence really is.I was recently told an interesting story about the plant, Lantana. In one part of Australia, Lantana is an obnoxious weed, then in another part it is a popular flower. No wonder it is a great title for a film showing how difficult it is to keep about one of the hardest human dimensions, that of relationships and the dark side of infidelity. Praise is all that Lantana deserves, and if you have been somehow effected by a relationship that has gone wrong, then you might just take something away from this landmark Australian film.

The reviews have been quite strong here in America, so I was worried my hopes might have been raised and even though it does meander a bit in the middle, this film builds and twists and turns and always leads you one way and then shows you something else. I've always liked LaPaglia as an actor (a native Australian) but of course in America he's usually cast as a gangster and underused. He gives a wonderful, underplayed performance. Parts of this film reminded me of a John Sayles movie - in that you would meet some characters for only a moment but right away have a sense to them and that they are three-dimensional. All the performances are strong and the women in the film LOOK like real women as opposed to Hollywood starlets. I liked how the movie seems to be just a mystery but what it's really about is trust and how it is needed in a marriage and any relationship.

Lantana shows that a good script in the hands of a talented cast and a subtle director can be made into a clever and interesting experience.I was particularly taken by the supporting cast rather than the headliners (La Paglia, Armstrong, Hershey and Rush).  Vince Colosimo and Daniella Facinelli (hope that's the right spelling) were a convincing and realistic couple and it was great to see the likes of  Peter Phelps and Glenn Robbins cast against type.  For my money, the pick of the performances was Rachel Blake whose role as a not particularly likeable but incredibly real woman was played with empathy and conviction.It is interesting to see a movie based almost entirely on one emotional premise - trust between partners being all important in a relationship. All of the main relationships (bar one) flounder on the basis of diminishing trust and it is this that drives the action.  A clever and adult idea which highlights the movie's origins in a play.My only gripe was that the movie was perhaps 10 minutes too long and I found the ending slightly too convenient, although I was the only one in my group who felt that so perhaps I'm just a cynic.In a year of movies made to appeal to people whose IQ is less than their age, it is nice to see a group  of talented people aiming high and almost achieving all they set out to do.

The very occasional director, Ray Lawrence (his last film was `Bliss' in 1985) has taken Andrew Bovell's play `Speaking in Tongues' and made a very effective film of it. Despite the occasional histrionics it cannot be described as a filmed play. The camera is used to great advantage and some memorable visual images obtained eg the opening sequence where the camera slowly tracks over a profuse growth of that pretty but prickly introduced pest, Lantana, until it comes to rest on a woman's body caught within.The plot revolves around the circumstances in which the woman met her end. Three of the couples have probematical relationships. A policeman (Anthony La Paglia) is having an affair (or at least a two-night stand) while his wife (Kerry Armstrong), aware something is wrong, is seeing a psychiatrist for therapy. The psychiatrist (Barbara Hershey) is in a mess herself. Her young daughter was murdered a couple of years previously and she and her pill of a legal academic husband (Geoffrey Rush) are held together mainly by grief. She also has a rather sinister gay client (Peter Phelps) who she comes to believe may be involved with her husband. The cop's lover (Rachel Blake) is estranged from her husband (Glen Robbins) and presents a threat to the happiness of the battlers next door (Vince Colsimo and Daniella Farinacci), though they are the least screwed up of the four.  When the cop comes to investigate the death the plot thickens, but all is resolved in the end.It's a good story cleverly told and the acting is first rate &#150; no-one misses a beat. I loved the moment when the cop bursts into his 15 year old son's room to catch hin smoking pot and says to him `for God's sake, I'm a cop.' The kid replies `You should be able to get me some really good stuff then.' Drug exhibits have a habit of disappearing from Sydney police stations. But the real strength of the movie is the honesty with which it portrays emotional deceit and its consequences &#150; what we do to ourselves and to others when we are too tired or cowardly to deal with how we really feel about those close to us. To fall in and out of love at 20 is painful but easy. To find yourself out of love with you partner after 20 years of marriage is painful and hard. No wonder we put off the day of reckoning and no wonder it sometimes takes a tragedy to bring us to that day.

Let us give thanks that producers in other countries may still find funding for movies not crafted shallowly for the American main-stream!Lantana is a brilliant movie.  Lantana is not a Hollywood movie, nor an American movie.  The last two points to me seem strongly connected to a great part of the intrigue that this movie offers us; the development of its male characters.  Lantana's men are complex, real and emotional.As we are introduced to the men in Lantana we are offered a lot of stereotypes to move along with as we explore the story's central questions and the unfolding of a mystery.  This mystery, however, is ultimately tied to the true nature of the male characters whose individual mysteries of personality and feeling, or lack thereof, conceal the answers.How refreshing to watch a movie that explores the situations and the related emotions of a varied range of male characters.   Ray Laurence has brought many of this story's characters' emotional complexities to the screen in detail, thereby exploring issues of how men in our society experience, both internally and externally, issues of strength and weakness, of the 'true' nature of masculinity, of loss, loneliness and love, and exploring how all these factors play into our sexualities and our varying needs of companions.That seeing an assortment of men and male realities portrayed on the screen is so refreshing and unusual may be a wake-up call to many film-goers whose expectations of movies and perhaps even of people are narrowed and dulled by the dross of Hollywood -- not by its art or influence, but by the sheer, massive, macho shallowness that it assails us with.The citrus-freshness of Lantana's complement of male characters is well-set amongst a group of women having depth and independence from the basic 'feminine' behaviors that many of us come to anticipate when watching or thinking in a cinema setting.  These the women are not fully-reasoned-yet-frail, not easily-influenced-yet-ethically-superior (to the men).Lantana is set, acted and directed well, with no superfluous flash or titillation to distract from the truly rewarding story and its characters.Hello Hollywood... are you watching?

I knew that it had cropped up on several critics' Best Of lists, and that may be the reason why I eyed it so warily for so long. I have followed recommendations based on these so-called lists before, and more often than not regretted doing so. But LANTANA turned out to be a pleasant surprise, which I love getting when a film I have no expectations of shows me something in a way that I've never seen it before. Like the beautiful but thickly tangled foliage of the title, this is a subtle and insightful film. The actors' equivalent of a chamber piece, it's an ensemble drama about relationships wrapped within the cloak of a crime thriller.From the very beginning, when we are shown the startling sight of a female body, torn, broken and twisted, hidden in the thorny embrace of a thicket of lantana, the questions start automatically who killed her? How did she get there? Who is she?All the answers lie within the connections, both obvious and hidden, between four different Aussie couples, three of them sort of upscale and miserable, one doing a little better than the others, if not financially. Detective Leon Zat (WITHOUT A TRACE'S Anthony La Paglia) is in the process of slowly losing the love of his wife, Sonja (Kerry Armstrong), by having a fling with another woman. Academic John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) and his wife, noted therapist and author Dr. Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) are still reeling from the shocking murder of their teenage daughter, Eleanor. Where Valerie has found some strength and solace in writing about Eleanor and the ordeal and speaking publicly about it, John is so frozen by his own anguish that he is rendered incapable of being able to offer his wife any comfort. Free-spirited and well-meaning Jane (Rachael Blake) has been separated from her husband, Pete (Glenn Robbins) for some time, and has actually started dating again. She is still friendly with the couple next door, Pete's best friend Nik (Vince Colosimo) and his wife, Paula (Daniela Farinacci). Nik is currently unemployed, so Paula works extra shifts at her job, while he does the Mr. Mom thing with their three kids. Although they are obviously struggling, it's Nik and Paula who have the strongest bond of any of the couples.The pleasure of digging through LANTANA is discovering how that body from the film's opening and everything associated with it, slowly unravels all the ways in which everyone touches everyone else's lives whether they know it or not, and not just the principal characters. Even the peripheral ones Leon's partner, Detective Claudia Wiss (Leah Purcell); a troubled and troubling patient of Valerie's named Patrick (Peter Phelps); Nik and Paula's kids - all have a part to play in the story, and no part is unimportant.Even more striking are the different ways in which each pair relates to one another as the worse part of for better or worse sorely tests the limits of long-term relationships, not- so-casual affairs and all the pressures that reveal how sometimes, love really isn't all you need to survive. Director Ray Lawrence and writer Andrew Bovell, adapting his play Speaking In Tongues, have crafted a thought-provoking piece that meditates on the very nature of what it means for a couple to be together, and once again asks the age-old question set so long ago to a snarky Howard Jones tune What Is Love, Anyway?

The marital relationships of four couples are depicted and how they intersect because of a murder thats taken place. Lantana does not take a judgmental stand on marriage in general. I didn't think it was trying to give any message about that state of the modern marriage in the 21st century or anything so profound. It is about 4 couples dealing with situations in their marriages, trying to understand each other but most importantly trying to understand their own needs and wants from their spouse.Eventually you end up getting involved in the lives of these people and you observe that each of them has a more definite understanding of where they are and where they would like to be.

For example, I always thought The Ice Storm was missing something, and even parts of the mostly intriguing Magnolia seemed a little hackneyed. So coming out of Ray Lawrence's Lantana, I wasn't in the least bit surprised to find myself completely unmoved.Dr. Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey) is a psychiatrist and author of a book about her daughter's death (entitled Elanor). One night, she disappears off of the main road. Detective Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia), whose wife Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) visits Dr. Somers regularly to talk about their relationship, is called in to investigate the case. The problem with that is thus the main suspect is the neighbor of the woman he is having an affair with (Jane O'May, played by Rachael Blake). He constantly grills Dr. Somers' husband John Knox (Geoffrey Rush) to find out more about his wife's emotional state. I think that is enough for me to say before I ruin some of the film's few surprises. Lantana is undoubtedly a strongly acted film. Kerry Armstrong and Geoffrey Rush in particular, who for the most part are at the receiving end of the emotional blows, are solid. Barbara Hershey, Rachael Blake and Anthony LaPaglia also bring the film to a slightly higher level. The film is also well shot. The film's opening shots, first of a lantana bush then zooming in on a lifeless body, are eerie and almost haunting. However, although the cinematography of Lantana is well crafted, there are continuous long, lazy shots of this lantana bush that appear one too many times and push its symbolism way too much. That was a thorn in the side of crafty, although not all together innovative, cinematography. The plotting of Lantana is, to be honest, complex and intricate. However, it is this intricacy that ultimately proves to be the film's downfall. It seems it would rather be content with weaving in and out of various relationships than letting us connect with any of them. We know how the relationships stack up, but we have no feeling for any of it. We are told how the characters feel about each other, but since the development of each one is so rushed, we can know nothing about the individuals. Yet, by the end, Lantana expects us to care deeply about each person, even those ones who have little significance in the big picture. Lantana is a well controlled, almost masterfully handled film. Ray Lawrence knows exactly how he wants to get where he wants to go, but takes one too many shortcuts. I was involved with Lantana, but was untouched by it; I walked out of the theater feeling cold. Films like this are often well done but are almost always forgetting one thing that a relationship stems out of two individuals, the individuals cannot necessarily be defined by their relationships alone. In Lantana, we do not get real human beings, instead merely shadows of them.

The notion behind the writer's mind is great turn the mystery form (a cop, a body, many clues, ample suspects) on its head, rather like `Twin Peaks' and suspend us in the world of the involved by changing the whole focus of the thing. Build the fabric of relationships around four (and a half) interlocking partnerships. Use a particularly subtle piece of whodunit misdirection to imply that no one is at fault with all these marital crimes. Be very clever in smoothly taking us to the logically unexpected. Employ some accomplished actors.And then the problems begin. This is artistically placed in the center of a triangle defined by `Short Cuts,' `Lone Star,' and `Ice Storm.' (The score in particular is very similar to Sayles'.) But it has none of the deftness of any of these. The central problem, I think, is that when you depend on the small subtlties of the relationship and the nuances of the actors, the camera has to be there. We have to be engaged through our eye. This camera isn't as effective as it needs to be. It isn't where it can convey the undercurrents. The actors and environment are not lit to emphasize the clarity of the situation, which in fact is quite abstract. This is why Altman can do this sort of thing and others, Andersen included, cannot. Altman is a master of placing the camera where he thinks he needs to be to curiously, slightly intrusively explore the emotional space the actors create.Sayles works the other way by anchoring the camera and staging the actors in a similar, exceedingly well engineered frame. The storytelling is sculpted by these frames. Lee works less with the camera than the lighting, but to the same effect. None of that is managed here. Instead, we have a TeeVee perspective. The camera is always external and unattentive. The world of light doesn't believe these characters exist (except for the few scenes in the brush).A related problem is that when it came to actually creating the characters, the writer wasn't as clever as  he was in conceiving the situation. These characters -- with one exception -- aren't full people. They are instead tokens of attributes, and the interactions we see are not so much the rubbing of skin and sharing of breath but the bumping together of personality traits. All we get are effects, never causes. This isn't quite at the level of `What's Cooking?' but it is dangerously close.The one exception is Jane, who really works hard to fill in a whole person, apparently against the will of the director. Is Rachael Blake going to be one of our very fine Australian-trained actresses like Kate or Cate?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

Sorry about the nasty stiff opening; don't be put off, this is not another Twin Peaks. Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia, famous Aussie-pronounced  'AuZZie'-son with fake Italian accent) is the powerhouse anchor who confidently threads three or more plots together for our experience of Lantana (2001). Jane (Rachel Blake) is the 'separated' adulterer and probably the stupidest character of this ensemble cast. For someone as middle aged as she is, she's almost embarrassingly inexperienced about men (who knows why she's 'separated'). She has the one-night-stand that happened twice with the married man because she appears to think that the man's wife is to blame. Hahahahahaha! Unfortunately she also doesn't know how to keep female friends-certainly not in her current glow of anything is possible (yep, gross stupidity is very possible for her). The second powerhouse actor of Lantana (2001) is the fabulous Kerry Armstrong as Leon's wife Sonja. She still burns with the desire to be a passionate, capable, sexy wife, who is also raising two boys while holding down a job and trying to inject sensuality and fun back into her morose, resentful, uncommunicative, robotic (depressed) husband. She even suspects, as most wives sense, that he is having an affair, just from the abnormal way he reacts to everything. So she cracks open her emotional hope chest to a psychiatrist, Dr Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey). To our surprise, the psychiatrist herself is on shaky ground. (Never envy anyone else. Chances are, they have their own insoluble problems, no matter who they are. Your problems are yours to keep, they are your own badges of courage. Talking them through is probably the only education or improvement we can hope for learn from others -YES. Covet their lives? -NO.) Dr Somers also, for some reason, chooses to waste her entirely non-evident education quizzing her husband about his very sensible attitude to the amount of sex they now have. OK, so they have drawn apart because of their differing personal reactions to the death of their teenage daughter-that much is at least believable. But how can a psychiatrist be so clearly at stage 0 with her own husband? If anything, married people know too much and import too much peripheral baggage with every nuance, every tilt of the head, every tone of voice, etc. They don't have almost teenage conversations like Do you ever worry that we don't make love very often? -No. I mean I don't think about it that much. Why not?(in a tone of complete inability to imagine how that might be). -I love you. Whether we make love three times a week or once a month doesn't really change that ... is this a test? No! I was just wondering what you were thinking... Really? Even after he gave you the answer, you were still only just wondering? Pfft, and this woman is supposed to be a shrink! Do any married women out there think this was an intelligent conversation befitting ANY married couple, let alone when one of them is a psychiatrist?!?! I gotta believe that this conversation really belonged to the other married couple, Paula (Daniela Farinacci) & Nik (Vince the curls get the girls Colosimo, from The Wog Boy (1999)), who are at least suitably young. The psychiatrist and her husband John (Geoffrey Rush) recover their married maturity in the restaurant and in front of the bookshop window that displays her book about Eleanor, their deceased daughter. I don't even mind that they fight the following morning, after having some more of that much-sought-after sex (see? It wasn't worth it. That's called 'perfunctory'), and that their pall of disenchantment/alienation is not lifted. She does seem to be losing her grip in other ways. The ease with which she lets her gay adulterous patient rattle her confidence in herself is very indicative of her mental desperation. Of course her husband was correct that she should refer that pesky patient on, but she stupidly persists because she resents his dismissive tone, and because she paranoiacally imagines the gay patient to be having an affair with her own husband(!!), when all he is is just an immature, arrogant, shallow, offensive bastard. Patrick Phelan, Mr sex unencumbered by need (Peter Phelps), just plays her because he senses that she disapproves of his ethics (not his gayness), which, being shallow and arrogant, he doesn't want to give up. Patrick, mate, BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR. YOU MAY GET IT. Claudia (Leah Purcell, Leon's female cop partner) is the most together person (because her life remains fairly uncomplicated'-anyone see a lesson in that?). She gives Leon the best advice of his life. It comes as a rhetorical question Why are you trying so hard to screw; your life up? You don't know how lucky you are to have the marriage you've got. And you're whizzing all over it. Too true. What is rewarding is that each and every story arc gets an insightful resolution. Ironically, because of the murder mystery, life goes on. Almost every adult character gets a revelation of their likely future, to show some lessons to the audience. Patrick Phelan gets to suffer in his jocks (quoting Michael Caton from The Castle (1997) here). I don't mind blowing the ending to his arc he gets to stare in envy in the rain at some ENcumbered need (there is no such thing as truly unencumbered sex, unless you are non compos mentis-zonked out of your skull at the time; and even then it's doubtful). Just remember what John confessed, when you see Leon and Sonja dancing, that after you have been caught out in an affair, you are never quite trusted again. Something DOES get broken (watch Sonja's face). It's astonishing to me that people keep walking blindly into that. For what? Sex unencumbered by need, perhaps?

It was quite different from other Hollywood movies. I was attracted to the plot about a high energy advertising man portrayed by Barry Otto and the ensuing happenings after his heart attack moments of revelation. The film's presentation may seem 'odd or high jinks' to some but I found it quite interesting. Lantana 2001 is more than interesting. It's quite involving psychologically, with layered and overlapping storyline of four couples in various shades of relationship. It can also be considered as a suspense thriller - its intricate progression is easy to follow yet you can't exactly guess what's gonna happen next. The film's presentation is smart, with very good performances all round.Anthony LaPaglia is Leon Zat, the cop detective, who came through the experience of it all lost and found. Barbara Hershey is Dr. Valerie Somers, the psychotherapist who can't help herself or her husband due to the loss of her daughter still haunting her. Hence she's not much good for her clients. What happens to her character, directly or indirectly, fate or not, touches the rest of the ensemble cast.Geoffrey Rush is John, Valerie's husband, who equally delivered the taciturn, restrained, suffering inside aspects of a husband/father quite alone to himself, without wife and daughter. Rachel Blake is Jane, who's seeking for extramarital satisfaction from her unsatisfying marriage to Pete (Glenn Robbins). Vince Colosimo and Daniella Farinacci are Nik and Paula, the not as well-off yet seemingly enviable neighbors with children and baby next door to Jane. Kerry Armstrong is Sonja, Zat's wife, the seemingly more sane person among the lot yet fragile within nonetheless. For steadying balance, we have Leah Purcell as Claudia, Zat's cop partner, who's by herself waiting for the right man to approach her.Somehow they are all insecure in each of their own ways. Marriage, relationships are not easy to maintain or lightly sustainable. It's like the tango lessons the Zats are taking - work and intimacy required.  There's a theme of loss, literal or mythical. Loss of vitality in work. Loss of vigor in living - love's lost. It seems loss and grief unlimited yet it's not a depressing film. It keeps you interested by its clever plot, unexpected sequences and situations. Simply fascinating to watch how the film develops and the characters interplay. It's a revelation to see another possible phase of parent reactions to the loss of a daughter (a son in the case of In the Bedroom with Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson) and how they survive, or did they? No doubt the central character is LaPaglia's Leon. In a way, he's luckier even though there's the entanglement of a drug taking elder son and a near heart attack. He's blessed with an insightful younger son Dylan (Marc Dwyer) who has the guts to bridge the communication gap between his parents (a lot transpired by the brief scene where he conveyed a telephone message from Dad to Mom). His wife Sonja, deep down, does love him in spite of his inconsiderate attitudes, frustrations of mid-life crisis.The film reminds me of writer-director (Run Lola Run) Tom Tykwer's Winter Sleepers 1997, where fate and coincidences were at play in the heart of the story. LANTANA is a truly refreshing import from Australia.

This endurance is hammered in at the end, in a manner reminiscent of Apotheosis scenes in nineteenth century opera, though admittedly no angels are seen flying about, not for want of the requisite special effects. This final Apotheosis flies in the face of the rather bleak picture painted through most of this movie. The issue explored at a deeper level is that of the manifold ways betrayal can poison a relationship. This issue arises in three of the four central (and in one of the two `secondary') relationships, but with the exception of the Zats (Leon and Sonja), we only get to see the deteriorated state of the marriage after the crucial betrayal has taken place, and we are shown the strategies followed by the partners to paper over the ensuing damage. That these relationships endure is the point of the movie. The fascinating question as to how these strategies have evolved is left unaddressed. The other fascinating question is why the precarious equilibrium these strategies seem to maintain, is worth maintaining in the first place. The interesting answer provided to this question is that the two partners have an inexhaustible need for each other, probably to keep alive their belief in the love that started it all, and to keep alive the possibility of an absolution for the betrayal that ruined it. The Altmanesque structure of every character interacting with almost every other character in this movie (no six degrees of separation for any two of them!), seems to convey the message that in the presence of an outside world, the temptations which lead to betrayals are unavoidable The movie is well made and raises important issues. The acting is first rate throughout.

"},{"Title":"As close to perfect as I have seen this year.","Date":"14 November 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":"  To my mind a great film does two things, on the one hand it operates to entertain, on the other it should be a catalyst for thought and personal reflection. Lantana does both to a far greater degree than anything I have seen this year, or for quite a few years I think.Lantana's greatest power resonates within its performances, usually in a relatively good film you will see that a headline actor will maybe do a really good job in a film, taking the character, taking the words written on the page of a script and making them his own. In Lantana, every single actor goes above and beyond that which usually constitutes a 'good' job, taking their words and crafting a performance from them to a degree such that they aren't on the screen creating a character, they are up there creating a person. Each individual performance by each individual actor, coupled with exceptional writing adn direction, extends this film into greatness.Anthony LaPaglia (Leon Zat) plays as the centrepiece character of this film, and it is a magnificent performance, but his power as this character only exists because of the way that it is countered by each of the others he shares the screen with. I particularly liked a character played by Glenn Robins (Pete O'May) who operates as a walking intertextual reference, his character isn't in the least bit funny, he is in fact rather tragic, but Robins' previous work exclusively in comedy carries that humor into Pete's character. I believe that most actors would see that as a flaw in the performance but in this case Robins' amusing innocence aids the character immensely, as it does the film, because Lantana is so otherwise devoid of humor, the slight undertone of comedy Robins brings to his scenes acts as an attractive balance to the fairly heavy dramatic tone of the rest of the film.I was also intrigued by Geoffrey Rush as John Knox an academic mourning the loss of his murdered daughter as well as the dissappearance of his wife, in actuality Rush is most usually intriguing. Upon saying that I have to reflect that every character in this film is intriguing, that is its strength. They are so intriguing because these people aren't particularly good, but they aren't particularly bad either, they are people. These characters allow us to become so enveloped in their world because they honestly don't seem like characters, they seem like people, like you and I. In 121 minutes they and director Ray Lawrence build a world, not limited by a story, not limited by character events, which is remarkably similar to our own.There are needy characters, there are dissatisfied characters. There is an interesting quirk in the narrative that both Zat's wife (Kerry Armstrong) and the woman he is sleeping with (Rachael Blake) are so similar, so starved of passion in their lives that they all wind up in the same Latin dance class. All these character, with the equally attractive, distractive and repugnant sides of their personalities, extract a response from us, the audience, because they are so like those characters we know in our lives. In truth I don't really 'like' some of my greatest friends, I don't feel bad about that, that is just the way that it is, but I still stick around because these people are interesting and they are a part of my life. The people, the characters of Lantana, for a short while at least will become a part of your life too. It is a testament to the power of the performances of this film that when the screen went black I wanted to stick with them too, they aren't all great people, in fact none of them are, but I still like them, and I still want to know them because in reality I guess they're a lot like me. It's not a bad thing, and it's not even a sad thing, it's just the way that it is.I can't help but describe Lantana as anything less than great, or spectacular would be more accurate maybe, though it is a spectacle of psychological drama. It made me think about my life, I suspect it will make you think about yours, and for the entire stretch I was engaged completely in what was going on. As an Australian film student Lantana makes me very, very excited; excited with the anticipation that one day I may be able to work in a film industry that could produce something of this quality, something this grand. I can't help but think that the greatest thing that a film can ever hope to do is make it's audience feel something, anything. Lantana will.

Nik saw Jane throw something out the car window into the Lantana plants, it's Valerie's shoe, and Nik is taken into custody refusing to answer any questions. Eventually it comes out that Nik was driving along the road, and picked Valerie up, but she jumped out again as they went along an unknown road, leaving behind the shoe. So Leon, his partner Detective Claudia Wiss (Leah Purcell), Nik and John go to the spot where she jumped out, and they do find her body, she accidentally fell down. When Leon returns home, he listens to the tapes of his wife having therapy with Valerie, she said she still loves him, and he cries.

Lantana is the kind of movie that by all individual measures is a little gem. But the whole of the movie is less that the sum of its parts. Lantana is made to be looked at, not analyzed. It involves a process, not a plot.The movie's premise seems to be that if you are neurotic enough, everything can happen to you. The director's need to throw a small world of disparate characters into each other's lives becomes ridiculous. In one situation, a cop, LaPaglia, is joined by a stranger in a bar who had just bumped into a woman on the street who railed at him for being agressive toward her. The two men talk, reflect, and bond. Later, the same cop is investigating a murder, of the railing woman, and must question his mistress. He arrives her house, knocks on the door, and when it opens, there stands his fellow bondee, who happens to be his mistress's estranged husband. Funny, right? Not here. Instead of playing the situation for comic effect, this becomes one more mystery of fate. The movie is so full of this intertwining of lives that the whole becomes a puzzle rather than a plot. And, it takes itself way too seriously. But no one in the film can laugh much because each is too neurotic to see humor in anything. Lines are delivered with the weight of suffering and conviction. Nothing in Lantana is light.Another movie which relies heavily on outrageous coincidence for it's story development is After Hours about a Manhattan businessman's twilight zone trek through a night of amazingly horrible bad luck. That movie has the plot advantage of a single character's struggle against the odds of his ever seeing dawn again. The night is absurd, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, but never quite ridiculous. The night in Lantana, and make no mistake, it is always night even during the day, is unrelenting. The noir metaphor is evident in the characters' pessimism toward redemption and in the several close-up shots of the film's namesake, a flowering, poisonous shrub.Maybe the director does realize he has been a little heavy-handed because the end of the movie is a series of this-is-what-happened-to-this-person shots. Now this can be seen as a confession that the director and writers could not resolve the story satisfactorily. Or, it might be that, after sitting through two hours of co-neurosis, director Lawrence wanted us to leave the theater with a feel-good notion about dark places. I go with the first idea. What I left the theater with was this With a few more characters Lantana could have been a four hour movie; with a couple less it could have been a good movie.

Though most would deny it, one is not the same person at forty years of age that they were at twenty; the emotional growth one undergoes over a period of time dictates that it cannot be so.  Unlike the changes one experiences during puberty and adolescence, however, that emotional growth is unceasing.  It may be said, in fact, that `change' within that context is the only real constant in life; and the effects of this perpetual state of flux on any particular individual is determined by that individual's experiences and derived from a personal frame of reference.  And the challenge of coping with the changes in our own lives forms a common thread that binds us together as a species, and it is those challenges and the ways in which we respond to them that forms the basis for director Ray Lawrence's affecting drama, `Lantana,' in which he explores the disparate ways that individuals, dissimilar and yet the same, strive to deal with this thing we call `Life.'Police officer Leon Zat (Anthony LaPaglia) is at a crossroads in his life.  In the parlance of Pink Floyd, he has grown numb, though not `comfortably.'  He has a wife, Sonja (Kerry Armstrong) and two children, and though he loves Sonja, this `numbness' that has left him devoid of feeling has driven him to an affair with Jane O'May (Rachael Blake), who has recently separated from her husband, Pete (Glenn Robbins).  Unlike Leon, however, Jane admittedly no longer loves her husband, and has no intention of taking him back.  Sonja, meanwhile, affected by the emotional distance Leon has put between them, is seeing a therapist, Dr. Valerie Somers (Barbara Hershey), who is currently coping with the emotional estrangement of her own husband, John (Geoffrey Rush), a chasm born of personal circumstances which neither seems capable of bridging.  The only happy couple in town, apparently, is Jane's neighbors, Nik and Paula Daniels (Vince Colosimo, Daniella Farinacci).  But as Nik is out of work, that, too may soon change.Different people, from different walks of life, each in their own way undergoing that change that is so inevitable.  But when one of those involved in the drama suddenly disappears one night, and another is subsequently implicated, it precipitates the intersection of the lives of all four couples, in a way that will ultimately effect a drastic change for some, and resolution for the others.Utilizing his remarkable ensemble cast to great effect, director Lawrence achieves success with this film through a studied and sensitive presentation of the material contained in the insightful screenplay by Andrew Bovell, which he adapted from his own play, `Speaking In Tongues.'  Very gradually, Lawrence carefully establishes the characters and their particular situations with an objective eye that refuses to allow a rush to judgment with regards to any and all of those involved here, even as he takes the drama to the heights of emotional involvement.  There is a natural rhythm and flow to his presentation, with an emphasis on the human aspects of the story, that enables the audience to make that vital connection with the characters as their story unfolds.  Lawrence succinctly peals away that protective outer shell of his characters and digs deep, exposing and laying bare their innermost thoughts and desires, ultimately achieving the result of giving everyone in the audience someone or something with which to identify and relate.  He puts it all on a very personal level; and it's a demonstration of filmmaking at it's best.Lawrence also exacts some extraordinary performances from his actors, beginning with LaPaglia, who does some of the best work of his career with his portrayal of Leon.  LaPaglia explores Leon from the inside out, and most importantly, manages to convey his findings to his audience.  While some actors in similar situations have a tendency to remain ambiguous, LaPaglia makes Leon's growth and development entirely discernible.  Unexpectedly, in fact, it is Leon in whom the emotional pinnacle of the film is realized, attained through a memorable performance by LaPaglia.Extremely effective, as well, is Geoffrey Rush, who turns in a performance that is so subtle it fairly crackles with understated emotion.  Some of the most affecting moments of the film, in fact, are those in which John and Valerie strive to reconnect and put their marriage aright.  And Hershey is terrific, too, with her portrayal of this woman who is so fragile and vulnerable beneath her requisite mask of professional strength and authority.It is in Sonja, however, that we see most clearly the inner turmoil that, in the final analysis, is shared by all of the characters in the film, albeit in accordance with their own, individual situations.  But as portrayed by Kerry Armstrong, we get, especially, that sense of the common challenge of coping with the changes life throws at us seemingly at random.  It's a notable performance, entirely convincing, and it adds greatly to the overall credibility of the film.Also noteworthy are the performances of Colosimo, Blake, and especially Farinacci, whose winning portrayal makes Paula the most empathetic of all the characters in the film.  The supporting cast includes Russell Dykstra (Michael), Peter Phelps (Patrick), Leah Purcell (Claudia), Nicholas Cooper (Sam) and Marc Dyer (Dylan).  A film that works as entertainment, but even more by way of enlightenment, `Lantana' is engrossing, engaging cinema that will make you think and reflect about the changes you've encountered and will encounter in your own life; an inspired film that reaches out and touches the humanity that resides within all of us, that mirror being held up that affords us a good look at ourselves and allows us to decide whether or not we like what we see.  And if we don't, perhaps this film will become the catalyst that makes us do something about it.  And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.

Smartly woven interplay of characters overlapping infidelities, implosive violence and impulsive choices mixed with a keen adult edge in this erotic thriller that echoes Robert Altman's Short Cuts with LaPaglia at his career best, arguably his best onscreen work to date, as a conflicted family man/Aussie police detective embroiled with a passionate affair with listless Armstrong on the verge of divorce and a not so rosy outlook on her present/future states.    A shrewd gem of a movie that has multi-layers at its surface value which turns on a dime and its gradual pace makes the viewer only wanting more to be revealed.  Based on the play Speaking in Tongues by Andrew Bovell, who adapted his own work here.

The movie is not necessarily unique with its characters, storyline and such but it certainly is unique in its approach, in which it focuses on the character's relationships, rather than on the 'muder-mystery'. The end result is a well balanced movie, with a bit of 'everything' in it.This Australian movie feels more 'Europe-like' than 'Hollywood-like', which is refreshing. So that means that the movie is build-up and moves slowly and isn't afraid to show life as it is.Perhaps build-up a bit too slow. The first halve of the movie is definitely its lesser part. The movie becomes a bit of a drag at points, especially because it isn't always clear were the movie is heading to, which is good for the genre but it also makes the movie too slow and at times boring in this case. In its first halve the movie is also hanging together from its coincidences when basically every character in the movie meets the other at some point, without having always a clear purpose story-wise. It seems totally redundant and it feels like the film-makers were trying too desperately to 'cleverly' connect all the story-lines and characters. A bit too unlikely all to consider this movie 'realistic' or fully credible.However the second halve of the movie surely compensates enough and the movie becomes mostly intriguing to watch. The movie is multiple layered and constructed, mainly due to the many characters that are in it. This approach works out best- and pays off in the second halve. The approach of the movie also works out due to the fine actors that are in the movie and some well written dialog. Anthony LaPaglia is slow and boring, in others words perfect for the main character in this movie. Geoffrey Rush gets surprisingly limited down in his role, when it comes down to screen time but this really fits the character and it says a lot about the quality of the movie that it has got Geoffrey Rush in a small supporting role. He is such a great actor.However rating this movie with a mark higher than 7 would be giving the movie too much credit. That rating would indicate that this movie is great and near perfect and among the best movies of the past few years. That really isn't the case, since its weaker first halve and other more smaller imperfect elements.Worth seeing if you want to see a mystery movie with a different and more dramatic approach.7/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"enjoyable with online commentary","Date":"29 May 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Mystery","Review":" I enjoy this kind of films which are out of the ordinary. When they start out with a cast of seemingly unrelated characters it really helps to have a site like this which can explain to me what I may be missing. I just watched it on IFC cable and (though I won't save it because it would take 2 DVDs) I recommend it for the amount of human insight it showed. As a senior person, I've seen/done it all and really appreciate good films.I saw comments on your site about the 2 joggers and hoped to see some explanation about why the unknown breaks down as he did and wanted to see more about some of the other minor characters as well. I also like to see crimes solved rather than loose ends but I appreciate that was part of the style of the film.

They're certainly well presented.  Sometimes we're properly prepared for a coincidental meeting; sometimes we're half-prepared; often we're distracted by something else until the last second; sometimes we're prepared for the wrong thing.  Maybe we're being toyed with, but the strange thing is, it doesn't feel as though we're being toyed with.Given the gripping story and the well-drawn relationships (another writer remarked that the CHARACTERS, as opposed to the relationships, aren't so well drawn, and he's right to think this, but wrong to think it matters in a film primarily concerned with how we related to one another), the humour and the acute observations, the spot-on acting ... well, it's a pity about some other elements.  The camerawork is at best unremarkable.  The musical score is unhelpful, and painfully banal.  These things threaten to drag what could have been a magnificent film down to the level of a cheaply made teledrama.  Luckily they don't succeed.  It may have been a mistake for Ray Lawrence to place ALL of his trust in the cast and the script, but he did so without being let down by either, and somehow managed to get away with it.

This disturbing idea alone might be enough to cause a spark of interest. But unfortunately, the spark doesn't fire due to the movie being so boring.We cannot give ourselves...we are our own. - James Joyce.

Either the scriptwriter or the director or Barbara Hershey has never actually met a genuine psychiatrist. It's IMPOSSIBLE for them to be afraid. Unless, of course, they're complete frauds. With an understanding of psychology, Barbara Hershey would have NEVER in a million YEARS misinterpreted the driver's actions like she did. A psychologist and a psychiatrist NOT ONLY have wrestled with their own faults and conquered them, they have a capacity to read people that borders on telepathy. So, she would have never given in to fear for THOSE two reasons. I've been in more than my share of life threatening situations and I've chilled out the perp in less than 10 seconds...with the one exception being that the perp is in the midst of a psychotic episode (which explains the hook on my right hand but that's another story). This driver clearly was not. But then, admittedly, I'm not a woman and so I have to allow that their take on going for a drive with a stranger might be somewhat different than mine.

Last week I have seen two movies and both were wrongly rated. The one which was written down was The Sphere by Barry Levinson, a pretty good sci-fi thriller, and the one praised by critics is Lantana - a very average movie.The reason I sat through the two hours is because it was announced as a mystery thriller which it is of course not. The mystery (a vanishing wife) happens after one hour of film and one does not really care what happened to her or who might have killed her because she is an uninteresting character. The same goes for the other people in this movie. If the plot is weak the characters have to be strong. Unfortunetely the movie also fails in this direction. The main character, a policeman, is depressed and angry from the start and is depressed and angry at the end.The women in the movie are mostly hysterical like the psychiatrist (Barbara Hershey). She fulfills the cliché that the psychiatrist is the craziest of them all. Another example is the woman with the two small kids. Though she seems to have a good relationship with her female neighbor she gets completely hysterical when her husband is invented for a short morning coffee by her neighbor. What a bunch of likable characters.The dialog is weak also. The policeman interviews the husband of the vanished wife. Instead of focusing on the facts he asks him if he has an affair and if he is gay (!). Generally the movie has a mild undertone against homosexual people (because they might destroy families). Maybe this is the deeper message of this movie.The only interesting thing of the movie is the editing. But we know this already from Magnolia. "}]
