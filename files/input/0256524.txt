Many of the lines are funny with Allen, since it's his film, delivering most of them.The story goes on a bit too long but overall keeps your interest. The women in here, from Hunt to the office girl (Elizabeth Berkely) to Charlize Theron playing a Veroncia Lake-lookalike are all glamorous.Dan Akroyd, David Ogden-Stiers, Wallace Shawn and John Schuck are all veteran comedians who know their trade so the movie offers a lot of quality yuks. I'm surprised this movie isn't better known. I really enjoyed it the first time but laughed even more on the second viewing. Silly, but fun.

This has a tendency to influence what I think, or even how I watch a movie.  I made the mistake of reading a few reviews of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion before I watched it.  As I watched Woody Allen's latest opus, a tribute to the quick-witted &#145;screwball' comedies of the late 1930's and early 1940's, I found myself mentally arguing with the reviewers.  The very issues they had with this movie were some of it's greatest features. The plotline for Scorpion is simple.  Allen portrays an &#145;old school' insurance company detective with a fantastic record for solving his cases. Helen Hunt is a `streamlining expert' brought in to bring the insurance company in-step with the `modern world' of the 1940's.  Allen and Hunt's characters are like water and oil.  The two are hypnotized (with a Jade Scorpion used to induce the trance, hence the title) in a stage show, and later the hypnotist calls on Allen to steal the very jewels his company insures; Allen has no knowledge he has done this.  The fun ensues as Allen attempts to find the person responsible for the thefts.  While this is an over simplification of  the actual story, the actual story is perhaps too simple and predictable as well, but this is not the reason people go to Woody Allen movies. It is the well written dialog that fits each person delivering the lines;  the meticulous attention to detail of a period movie that works like a time machine transporting the audience on a trip to sixty years in the past;  the unpredictable humor that fills each predictable twist.  These are things that makes this movie work.One review criticized the casting of Allen in the lead role.  Allen, now 66, `was not believable in a romantic lead', and the critic went on to suggest that another actor should have been used.  This thought was swimming through my mind throughout the two hours of the movie.  Allen was perfect for the role.  His character, C.W. Biggs, is an aging insurance investigator, with few redeeming characteristics.  He is not supposed to be handsome or attractive.  Yes, the Wood-Man is getting old, but it works for the movie. There are some unflattering shots where we see his Godfather-like jowls. This is not the same thirty-something guy from Bananas or Sleeper; he is a sixty-something old man.  We need to accept this.  It is apparent that the filmmaker has accepted this for himself, and tailored the film to work with this in mind.  Helen Hunt's Betty Ann Fitzgerald can't stand C.W. in any way, and it is only after Volton (David Ogden Stires) hypnotizes her in a magic show does she not show that she loathes him.  Sexy and rich socialite Laura Kensington, portrayed by the beautiful 26 year-old Charlize Theron, is attracted to Biggs because he the antithesis of her past conquests something new and different.  Sure, he could have cast someone else, perhaps Jason Alexander, into his Biggs role.  While it would have certainly made an entertaining movie, there would have been something lost.  Woody needs to be in Woody Allen movies.  It just works.Another critic panned the casting of Elizabeth (Saved by the Bell, Showgirls) Berkley with such actors as Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Wally Shawn, et al.  True enough, Berkley's acting talents do not match up with the names I mentioned; but the casting of Berkley for the minor role of office secretary &#145;Jill' is perfect nonetheless.  Allen's attention to detail cannot be overlooked.  I first noticed in his 1987 film, Radio Days, just how detail oriented he can be.  As a musician, and something of an aficionado of vintage musical instruments, I always look for anachronisms in period movies when a band is featured.  I can usually tell the year a wind instrument was made just by looking at it.  Not only were all of the instruments true to the time portrayed, the label on the mute (a Humes and Berg &#145;Stonelined') used by a trombone was correct for the period.  One off the shelf in a music store today looks identical, except for small differences in the label.  I was amazed that this level of detail was made.  I am convinced this level of detail was made in the casting as well.  This movie is not only set in New York in 1940, but also as a Hollywood movie made in 1940; clich√©s common to movie making of the time abounded.  I believe the casting of Berkley in her role is another one of these details.  A movie made in that time would have featured headliners from the stable of lead actors from a movie studio, or perhaps one loaned from another.  These would be people in the roles Allen, Hunt and Aykroyd had.  The role of the office secretary would not have been filled by a star, but by one of the studio's contract players sent to the production by central casting.  There were many young, gorgeous actresses with questionable acting talent that were picked up by a studio in hopes of her developing into the flavor-of-the-week, or maybe for just a ride on the casting couch.  Elizabeth Berkley filled this role flawlessly.  She hit her marks, said her lines, and that's about it.  I think it is just what the writer / director wanted.The ensemble cast all delivered credible performances.  Like a film of the time, the only performances that stand out are those of the leads; it is Woody Allen and Helen Hunt's movie, as it should be.  (William Powell and Myrna Loy stand out in front of the cast of 1934's The Thin Man, who remembers Nat Pendleton or Minna Gombel?)  Dan Aykroyd plays an adulterant Insurance Company C.E.O. in much the same way as his  dramatic performances in Driving Miss Daisy or My Girl understated and credible.  He allows the writing to do the comedy for him, without having to work at it.  Charlize Theron's (Cider House Rules, The Astronaut's Wife) roll is smaller than her on-screen presence.  She makes for a perfect 1940's screen vixen.  David Ogden Stires always gives a good performance, and was able to shake the shadow of M*A*S*H's Maj. Winchester for a dead-perfect evil magician. Wallace Shawn in a Woody Allen movie is like having ice cream on a slice of cherry pie; always a welcome presence.  You may also see a familiar face or two but can never place the name; John Schuck, a veteran movie and television actor (Sgt. Charlie Enright on TV's McMillon and Wife) is one of them.  It is apparent that the writing was crafted for the star players, and terrific casting took care of the rest.Movies can be many things.  Some can inspire, some can be extremely poignant.  Others can just simply entertain.  The Curse of the Jade Scorpion falls under the entertaining types.  A perfect diversion as a weekend matinee, or as a follow-up to a nice dinner out, Scorpion does not make use of low-brow humor and stays true to the 1940's flair the movie, itself, portrays.With romantic interests like Helen Hunt and Charlize Theron, Woody Allen gives all men hope as we get older.

Woody Allen in his classical style, as good as ever.","Date":"9 July 2002","Score":"43 out of 58 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":"  I paraphrase from memory from Allen's speech at the 2001 Oscars `When the Academy called me, I was surprised - as you know, my movie, &#145;The Curse of the Jade Scorpion', hadn't been nominated for anything.  I thought maybe they'd called to apologise.'  At the time, I thought this was just another self-deprecating joke.  And I'm sure it was.  But having seen the film, I'm starting to think he had a point, or at least, as much of a point as anyone who complains about being snubbed at the Oscars ever has.In three of the categories which are ludicrously called &#145;technical' - art direction, cinematography costume design - Allen's picture had as much right to be included among the nominees as half of those that WERE included; it also had an original screenplay that had far more going for it than that of Amelie or Monster's Ball and it was at the very least above the AVERAGE quality of the films competing for the Best Picture award.Really - it's one of Allen's better films, and I don't see how anyone could reasonably think otherwise.  The early, pure comedies which some people supposedly still long for (Take the Money and Run, Sleeper) weren't actually any funnier; the obvious classics (like Manhattan) weren't better structured, or cleverer, or more pointed.  (Granted, Manhattan, Zelig et al. had a divine spark which isn't, perhaps, to be found here, but you can't expect to be zapped by a divine spark every day of the week.)  It's an old-time romantic comedy, set in the 1940s, which could ONLY be set in the 1940s (and Allen has a magic touch when it comes to 20th Century period pieces; don't ask me to explain it), in which several clich√©s - a contrived and unlikely plot involving (in this instance) hypnotism, a male lead decades older than the female lead, an odd couple who start by loathing each other and end up in love - are explained, given surprising depth, and pressed into serving new functions.  When Briggs and Fitzgerald are arbitrarily HYPNOTISED into falling in love, it's like a comment on the absurdity of the way love strikes in romantic comedies ... but the story never fails to work perfectly when taken straight, too.  All of Allen's implied second-order comments serve, in the end, to enrich the first-order story.  It's as if he decided to show us that fiction crafted to debunk the conventions of other works of fiction CAN actually be good in its own right, when it's done by a true artist rather than some wanker with a theoretical axe to grind.  The result The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is diverting, pleasurable, and satisfying as not one film in a hundred succeeds in being.Place this alongside Sweet and Lowdown and you'll wonder how the rumour that Woody Allen's powers are declining ever got started.  I blame the modern addiction to novelty.  Allen has been making movies for a while now, and even though his films today are no more derivative than they've ever been (less so, in fact), a Woody Allen picture is no longer a new KIND of thing.  The same people who would argue that Haydn's 102nd symphony couldn't possibly be as good as his 80th because the latter happened to have been written and performed first (and there are people who WOULD argue this, the instant it became fashionable to do so), will tell you that Curse of the Jade Scorpion is clearly inferior to, say, The Purple Rose of Cairo, because it's in the same style and vein, and was made later.  Put like that, the view sounds silly.  And indeed it is.

If you were truly thinking about that while watching The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, then you should reconsider the way you watch a movie. Sure, Allen is now really old, but who can play his role as well as he does. He sometimes casts other actors in that role, such as John Cusack in Bullet Over Broadway, but even though they do the job very well, they can't be better than the old man with the big glasses himself. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is not a serious Woody Allen movie. It is not one of his most important movies that is clear. But its aim is to entertain and entertain it does. Jade Scorpion shares a lot with Woody's recent light comedies such as Small Time Crooks and Manathan Murder Mystery. And like these two, it is certainly not a new Annie Hall. But it does not try to. It is just a lot of fun to watch. The script is funny, the acting is charming, the plot is just hilarious, and on the whole, this movie puts a smile on your face from the beginning to the end. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is another very nostalgic movie, like Radio Days, Sweet and Lowdown, Everyone Says I Love You and Bullets Over Broadway, but once again, Allen makes us forget for 103 minutes that he is basically doing nothing he hasn't done before.

I have since my 18th year thoroughly enjoyed his witty dialogue, his comedic and sometimes darker explorations into life, love, and death. In addition, I adore the variety of early jazz scores that he uses for his films.  That being said, Woody at 66 years of age has showed no signs of slowing down in his flm career, delivering by far the brightest and wittiest comedy I've viewed this year, in Curse of the Jade Scorpion. The film is a homage to the Pulp films of yesteryear. It's set in 1940, Woody plays the role of an aging detective in an insurance company. He has cracked many huge cases, receiving information from street contacts, and relying heavily on gut instinct and dumb luck. He can't stand the new efficiency expert (Helen Hunt) who is smarter than he is, younger than he is, poses a threat to his job, and can't stand him either. During a dinner party for a fellow detective's birthday, they are both hypnotized by the magician Zolton, who uses the powers of the 'Jade Scorpion' to make them fall deeply in love with one another. He snaps them out of it just as they are about to kiss, but Zolton never releases them from the key word that can at anytime send them deep into suggestive hypnosis. Later on, Zolton calls CW Briggs, hypnotizes him with the keyword, and uses him as a pawn to rob jewelry from rich estates.The casting in the film was excellent. There are supposed film experts out there who believe that Woody is too old for the lead in this film, and that it is unbelievable how Charlize Theron or Helen Hunt would ever fall for him. I wholeheartedly disagree. Throughout the film, Woody's character is not displayed as a handsome or romantic gent, in fact quite the opposite. In it he is called grubby, an inchworm, and a cockroach, just to name a few. Theron only wants to have sex with him as an experiment, since she is used to handsome and muscular men, not shrimpy and ugly ones. Helen Hunt is hypnotized into loving him, and vice versa, but when they're not under Jade's spell then they absolutely loathe each other ( I won't go any further into this so I don't spoil the film's ending.) Although Woody is ageing, his performance was outstanding, not losing a step as he delivers wise cracks and witty comments, one after the other. Helen Hunt also performs flawlessly and was actually a treat to watch her. As for the rest of the cast, Dan Aykroyd is decent in a small yet significant role, as well as Charlize Theron and Elizabeth Berkeley.The cinematography and the visual setting for the film in jazzy 1940 is absolutely exquisite, it is much more polished then his earlier works. The writing is excellent, as I've said before, Woody hasn't lost one step in his writing or his performance. The jazz soundtrack is, as usual, very pleasant and fits very well with the scenery. Overall, Curse of the Jade Scorpion ranks as one of my favorite Woody films. If you are a fan of his previous light comedies then you will definitely enjoy this little film. So what are you waiting for? Head up to the theatre and see it on the big screen.

But I think they're wrong about that. It's just that it was made about sixty years too late. It's really an homage to the sort of comedy/mysteries that were produced in the early forties -- the same time period in which the movie is set. Seems to me most people didn't get that. Maybe people these days don't watch enough old movies.Everyone was correct, of course, when they said Woody Allen was miscast (and since Woody Allen did the casting, he deserves the blame). But it's not that great a sin. Basically, this is a movie that should have been a vehicle for Bob Hope, but since Bob Hope wasn't exactly available in the year 2001, someone had to stand in for him. I daresay there isn't an actor in Hollywood these days who can do a good Bob Hope, and since there isn't, I have to say Woody Allen isn't such a bad substitute.Actually, I remember reading somewhere that Bob Hope was a major inspiration for the young Woody Allen, and he was stung in the late sixties when Hope told a few mean-spirited jokes about him. Maybe, all these years later, Woody Allen decided that all was forgiven.Anyway, don't let yourself be bothered by the fact that the lead actor is about 30 years too old for the part. Also, try to forget that nasty business with Soon-Yi. Just relax and let yourself laugh at the one-liners. Better yet, try and imagine that the lines are being delivered by someone with a ski-jump nose. You may see this movie for what it is -- a screamingly funny comedy, and the best movie Bob Hope never made.You know, someday Hollywood might find another actor who can play a role the way Bob Hope did, back in his heyday. And when that happens, this movie would be an excellent candidate for a remake.

Had this comedy been written and directed by someone else, it would've been a disaster but Allen with his magic touch, had produced a funny and charming delight. That's what my husband called it after we enjoyed it together and I can't agree more. I love Ellington's music, the whole 40-th setting, and Woody's one-liners. His face in the scene where he and Helen Hunt were both hypnotized was simply hilarious - the guy knows how to do a physical comedy to perfection.

THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION is no different, but the variety of actors, including Helen Hunt, Charlize Theron, and Dan Aykroyd make it interesting enough that it kept me entertained for much of its 100 minutes. Good, light entertainment, nothing more. It helps that I got the DVD on loan from my local library so there was no out-of-pocket cost to me. And, it still irks me that Allen insists on a mono soundtrack for all his films, basically turning his back on modern sound technology and snubbing his audience. many SPOILERS follow, you may choose to read no further.Set in 1940, Allen plays an insurance investigator, Hunt is the new girl in the office hired to make the operation more efficient, Aykroyd is their boss, married, but having an affair with Hunt's character. The title of the film comes from an evening out to celebrate the birthday of a coworker, and a magician uses a jade scorpion to hypnotize Allen and Hunt, for him the word that puts him in a trance was Constantinople, for her Madagascar. All thought it was just light entertainment but the magician had grander plans. After a suitable lapse of time he phoned Allen, and later Hunt, said the magic word, and had them perform heists of expensive jewels at properties that Allen had been the security expert for. Quickly under suspicion because of clues at the scene, footprint, hair strands, fingerprint, they obviously recalled none of it. Through street contacts, Allen traces the crimes to the magician and clears himself and Hunt.Allen plays his usual deadpan womanizer, in a strange twist Theron's character actually is in his apartment, about to go to bed with him, when he gets a call, goes into the trance, tells her to go home!  In the end, even though Aykroyd has gotten a divorce and is planning to fly to Paris with Hunt and get married, when Allen says, I love you. What's the hurry?  Where are you going, Madagascar? As if back in the trance, Hunt turns to him, expresses her affection, she and Allen walk away arm-in-arm. A bit confusing, because all thought that both spells had been broken, so we the audience aren't sure if Hunt was going willingly or not.The DVD picture is fine, the mono sound is boring, the extras are small and relatively unimportant.

Betty Ann is going nowhere though, she's having an affair with the big boss (Dan Aykroyd). That's why their colleagues find it so funny when Briggs and Fitzgerald are hypnotised (David Ogden Stiers plays the mesmerising Voltan) on stage and made to pretend that they love each other. When the show is finished and the laughter dies down things go back to normal. Unfortunately for Briggs and Fitzgerald, both have been left susceptible to the trigger word that was used to hypnotise them and this leads them to become unwitting pawns in the hands of a criminal puppeteer.With it's amusing conceit (there are a few moments when Allen is, unbeknownst to himself, investigating his own crime) and it's flow of insulting banter between the two leads, The Curse Of The Jade Scorpion is never dull or unentertaining.The cast also includes Elizabeth Berkley in a small role, Wallace Shawn and a sultry turn from Charlize Theron looking at her most beautiful so there are enough recognisable faces floating around even if the credits don't seem quite as stellar as some of the listings in other Allen movies.Sadly, there's nothing more spectacular to come and the movie doesn't build up to anything spectacular. Once things are set in motion that's enough to keep everyone trundling along to a climax that doesn't have any tension or suspense, despite the tale practically demanding both.It manages to creep just above average because of a number of harsh, amusing insults and the situations created by those hypnotic hijinks but it's a bit of a disappointment when compared to many of the man's better works. And I must say, as a minor footnote, that I didn't really find Helen Hunt as engaging or enjoyable a foil compared to many of the other leading ladies that Allen has irritated over the years.

In fact, it is set in 1940. A good idea for Woody who did do this well before. This one fails. Why? It was not crisp. Scenes were played with bad timing, incongruous acting styles and performers who seemed to have some difficulty in remembering their lines or recognizing their cues. Sloppy.There is supposed to be a thread of eroticism in the film, but the only performance with any sexual juice was Elizabeth Berkley as a sweet virginal office worker. She had charisma, but her part was small and she had no real significance in the plot.Woody Allen wasn't necessarily too old for his role; he was the wrong kind of old.

Of all of the films he's made in the recent decades this one is most reminiscent of the Woody Allen standup that first brought this genius to the world's attention. With every one of his movies there is a reason to love it. Sometimes that reason may not work for you, and so it goes. But if what you love is classic comedy delivered with great timing and character you cannot beat this film. Unlike so many modern Hollywood comedies--and even unlike so many Allen comedies for that matter--this one delivers the jokes regularly, tastefully and within a tightly packaged story. It's far fetched, sure. It wraps up in a predictable way? Of course! But it moves along nicely, never steps outside of its own defined boundaries and the characters are clever and true. To show his true genius and artistic merit look to Match Point, and Sweet and Lowdown, but for sheer entertainment and enjoyment value, add this to your collection as the best Woody has offered us in at least ten years.

Which is exactly what he's done with `The Curse of the Jade Scorpion,' which he not only wrote and directed, but stars in, as well.  Set in 1940, it's the story of CW Briggs (Allen), an investigator for an insurance company which, despite the exemplary achievements of CW has been slipping at the bottom line, forcing the company's exec., Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd), to call upon the services of an efficiency expert, Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt).  But there's a problem right from the start, in that CW and Betty Ann simply do not hit it off.  And the situation is quickly exacerbated when a rash of thefts-- involving millions of dollars worth of jewelry and goods-- begins to occur among clients for whom the company has installed security systems.  An inside job is suspected, and to CW's chagrin, more outside help is brought in.  So now CW has to contend with that, as well as his new nemesis, Betty Ann; and the way he sees it, there's only one way to fix it all  Solve the case.  And with that, the hunt is on...	Character and dialogue driven, Allen's film is loaded with atmosphere and detail that really puts you in the story; you can almost feel Bogart's presence in such films as `The Big Sleep' and `The Maltese Falcon,' the spirits of which permeate this film.  The dialogue is snappy and clever-- some of Allen's best ever-- and he presents it all in a way that sustains interest and makes it thoroughly involving and entertaining.  In fact, it's the ongoing banter between CW and Betty Ann that really makes this one click, and it's perfectly delivered, with timing by Allen and Hunt that is right on the mark.  	This is the most screen time Allen has had, himself, in some time, and he's good; his trademark neurotic groping-for-a-word delivery is tempered and finely tuned, which makes his character entirely credible.  Allen is looking older, but he's growing into his age well, and actually has a much less disheveled appearance here than usual, which has seemingly been an innate trait of his regardless of the role he's playing.  And, though there have been films of his that one could say simply had too much `Woody' in them, that is not the case here.  It's a good performance, his scenes with Hunt are alive, and he has some moments with Charlize Theron that are even better.	Hunt does a great job, too; Betty Ann is a bit like her Darcy McGuire in `What Women Want,' but with a harder, more intimidating edge that works well for this character.  She manages to make Betty Ann both feminine and feminist at the same time, reminiscent of some of the characters that Davis, Crawford and Stanwyck played so successfully in films past.  There's some obvious chemistry at work in her scenes with Allen-- the one in which they are hypnotized is hilarious-- but it's absent in her screen time with Aykroyd, though it may have more to do with their respective characters than anything.  And it's refreshing to see a strong female character to whom Allen's character can relate on a personal level that, though it involves conflict, is devoid of his typically neurotic and paranoid responses.  They may not like each other, but CW at least relates to Betty Ann in a very straightforward manner.  It has to do with the way the characters were written, of course, but part of it is in the way Hunt transfers the Betty Ann found on the page into a real person.	One of the highlights of this film is the performance by Charlize Theron, in which, as Laura Kensington, she is transformed into the second coming of Lauren Bacall.  Laura is the epitome of the femme fatale, in the way she looks, speaks and moves; you keep waiting for her to say `You know how to whistle, don't you Steve?'  It's a supporting role that actually affords Theron comparatively little screen time, but she makes the most of it, and she is certainly a memorable asset to the film.	Also effective in a small, but pivotal role, is David Ogden Stiers, as Volton, a part that would have been so perfect for the late Orson Welles.  In the absence of Welles, however, Stiers does a very commendable job.	Allen put together a terrific supporting cast for this one, including John Schuck (Mize), Elizabeth Berkley (Jill), Wallace Shawn (George), John Tormey (Sam), Kaili Vernoff (Rosie), Brian Markinson (Al) and Peter Gerety (Ned).  There's an inspired precision to this film, in the way Allen blends the story, characters and music (such a big part of creating that necessary atmosphere) that makes `The Curse of the Jade Scorpion' something of a minor classic in the Allen canon.  Aficionados of the classic films of this period will be especially delighted with this one, but anyone who appreciates a film that is well crafted and delivered and provides some solid entertainment will be satisfied, as well.  Allen geared this film to a specific audience (albeit fairly wide), and for those who fall within it's parameters, it's right on target.  One has to wonder, though, why he didn't film it in glorious black & white, which would have been so perfect.  But taken as it is, it's still a part of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 8/10.

Replete with false bottoms, this endearing and highly subjective homage to pre-War screwball comedy is a treat for anyone who thinks that cinema has something to say about collective representations and the substantial role it has played therein, and continues to do. Claiming that 60-year-old Allen is an unconvincing womanizer comically misses the point, just like the oft-repeated criticism of the pervasive anachronisms (as, most notably, in the lingo). For Allen surely never intended to come up with a historic movie that had an authentic feel. After all, and thank God or Allen's mother, Allen is not Spielberg. How could any of these dim-witted critics have missed the point that the plot revolves around a magician, an epitome of the fake? Allen's 1940s setting is nothing less than a compendium of the collective (conscious and unconscious) imagery associated with that time, shaped by the emerging medium of that time and its subsequent self-representations. By an irreverent reversal of proof, you could say that the film ultimately reflects the bitter-sweet view of an aging filmmaker on the goings of his trade, which is all the more worthy considering the current state of mainstream American cinema. Grant you that the dialogues are in part redundant, as are some of Allen's and Hunt's antics, and that the message (love strikes blind) is of no groundbreaking consequence, but if you are interested in the history and workings of film (and actually TV series), this Jade is a gem.

One of the things that makes it watchable is that the plot GOES somewhere. Somewhere around this time, Allen was turning out thin plots full of rows but lacking good jokes, like Manhattan Murder Mystery. Here Woody is an insurance investigator who looks into high-end jewel thefts. He works in a crowded office that is being rearranged by an efficiency expert, Helen Hunt, whom he hates. At a nightclub both Allen and Hayes are hypnotized and left with an open post-hypnotic trigger, the word Constantinople in Allen's case, and Madagascar for her.The villainous stage performer, The Jade Scorpion, calls them up at awkward hours of the night, triggers the hypnotic trance, and has them carry out heists for him. Allen becomes the chief suspect. And all of this mishigas takes place in a tangled web of relationships and buried lust of the kind that possesses Allen the film maker.The air is filled with insults and wisecracks, mainly from Allen. Some are pretty enjoyable. Allen plays his familiar nervous wreck, stuttering, put upon, and thoroughly confused. The girls -- and what girls they are -- look appealingly 1940-ish. The three principal women look great -- Elizabeth Berkeley, Charlize Theron, and Helen Hunt. If there's a problem with them, it's that they wear too many clothes. Shame.The musical score is of the genre that Woody Allen feels most comfortable with, period recording of Duke Ellington and the like -- Sophisticated Lady, How High the Moon, Sunrise Serenade. I kind of like it too, so much more affecting than listening to some gangsta threaten to rip my head off and pee down my neck cavity.You'll probably enjoy it and smile from time to time.

As a fan of Woody's, agree to disagree. The period art direction, costumes, hair and makeup, characterizations, atmosphere, and sensibilities offer Allen fans a beautiful platform for his cast to work from. And what a cast assembled!A magician (David Ogden Stiers) places an insurance investigator (Allen), under anxiety due to a recently hired office organizer (Helen Hunt) who has urged the company boss (Dan Aykroid) to use outside PIs in an independent investigation firm instead of the current in-house detectives on the payroll, under hypnosis, encouraging him through a trigger word to steal jewels held by his employers (or behind security for clients to protect their jewels). It happened while Allen was attending a birthday function for a fellow co-worker in a club with Stiers performing his hypnosis act. Hunt is also under hypnosis and later when Allen is unavailable, Stiers will use a trigger word on her to commit the same type of jewel heists.How this wronged man plot gets Allen off the hook is most amusing, but for me it is the traded barbs/insults/remarks between him and Hunt is what most entertained me personally. I realize Allen felt he was miscast in the lead, but the cockroach or weasel insults towards someone else wouldn't have had the same impact as when Hunt demeans him. The don't have a coronary or don't choke or be careful not to be hit by a truck conclusions to finished dialogues from Hunt to Allen make up some of the flirt later to give credence to their unlikely romance and alliance later. The case that develops against Allen is damaging but how Wallace Shawn and Brian Markinson learn of his hypnotic entrapment, rescuing him in the process, proves to be his salvation. Charlene Theron is a sultry and naughty femme fatale caricature, John Shuck is an opinionated employee who works at the company, and Elizabeth Berkeley landed a plum part as a stunning but supposedly airheaded secretary at Allen's company. The description of Allen's apartment by Theron, Allen conceding to Hunt after considering her a cipher that she is worth confiding in, and Allen giving Hunt as much as he takes offer rich dialogue exchanges and humorous quips to giggle at. Just lots of fun. The setting enhances the cast and words. A sleeper in Allen's oeuvre.

The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is fair adult comedy. Most of the adult theme is by innuendo, typical of the films of the mid-20th century. The time and place for this story is 1940 New York. The adult here is mostly in fast dialog riddled with insults, and references that most in a younger audience wouldn't understand.The plot is a creative one that uses a new twist to some old-fashioned crime capers. In many of Allen's films in which he stars, his usual whining character quickly wears thin with me. In this film, it isn't as much complaining as it is tongue-twisted and stumbling for words or the next line. That's a little easier to take.This is worth a few chuckles but it's not a special film to go out of one's way to watch or buy.

"},{"Title":"Enormous fun from start to finish","Date":"9 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" Woody Allen's most expensive film at $33 million, this is enormous fun from start to finish. The film has a witty and occasionally downright hilarious script and Allen's direction is very good. It takes place in October 1940 and is at times reminiscent of both the screwball comedies and the film noir classics of that era. I initially thought that the film should have been filmed in black and white to better evoke the early 1940s but, as I watched it, I was impressed by its vibrant colours so it was for the best that it wasn't. Allen himself is not a fan of the film, even claiming that it is his worst film, but I certainly am even if it isn't one of his heavy hitters.The film stars Allen as C.W. Briggs, an extremely successful but rather nebbish insurance investigator at the North Coast Casualty and Fidelity Insurance Company. While his performance is probably my least favourite of his so far, he is still very good in the role. Allen believes that one of the major problems with the film was his decision to cast himself as Briggs after several other actors turned it down since he was not suited to the role. It may not have been quite as natural a fit for him as the roles that he wrote for himself but I think that it works well, in no small part because Briggs has many wonderful lines throughout the film. Briggs is a very likable character who owes much of his success to the fact that he has many connections in the criminal world and can think like a criminal, frequently saying that it takes a thief in order to catch one.The best performance in the film comes from Helen Hunt who is wonderful as North Coast's comparatively new efficiency expert Betty Ann Fitzgerald. She not only disapproves of Briggs' old fashioned methods of investigation but she despises him on a personal level, describing him at every opportunity as a sleazy little megalomaniac, a scummy vermin, a wormy little ferret...Well, you get the idea. He can certainly give as good as he gets. He is not exactly enamoured of Betty Ann either...or so it would seem. Betty Ann is an interesting character as she is a strong, highly intelligent and capable woman in her male- dominated working environment but a bit of a disaster in her personal life. Her ex-husband left her for another woman and she has pretty bad taste in men, generally speaking. She is having an affair with her and Briggs' boss Chris Magruder, played very well by Dan Aykroyd, and believes him when he uses the oldest line in the book I'm going to leave my wife for you. Briggs told her that Magruder would never do so and I don't know who was surprised when he did him or me.Allen and Hunt's chemistry is not as strong as it could be but their scenes together are nevertheless very funny. Hunt's delivery of Betty Ann's numerous scathing putdowns is particularly effective. The revelation that Briggs and Betty Ann have feelings for each other underneath all of that open hostility and bitterness is not exactly shocking but the relevant scenes are written and handled well, which is always the most important thing in such cases as far as I'm concerned. When it comes to comic potential, however, I think that Allen may have missed a trick in making the respective words that send Betty Ann and Briggs into a trance Madagascar and Constantinople as opposed to Istanbul and Constantinople, even if the film's setting does predate the song.Charlize Theron's extended cameo as the femme fatale Laura Kensington is inspired and incredibly funny. She clearly enjoyed herself with the role. The scene involving Laura's visit to Briggs' charming little hovel of an apartment is one of the funniest in the film. There is a real sense of two disparate worlds meeting and Laura trying to see how other people live as her romantic conquests are usually more along the lines of Rudolph Valentino. The always excellent David Ogden Stiers brings a great deal of style and panache to the role of the nefarious hypnotist Voltan and, as such, provided another effective contrast to Allen. The film also features nice appearances from Wallace Shawn, John Schuck, Brian Markinson, Peter Gerety and Irwin Corey, who is still alive at 101, as Briggs' not very blind informant Charlie.Overall, I would not put this film on the same level as Hannah and Her Sisters, The Purple Rose of Cairo or Crimes and Misdemeanors but it's great fun and sometimes that's all I want or need from a film.

Miss Fitzgerald and CW Briggs work together in an insurance company and happen to hate each other, but doe to an hypnosis made by a thief, they have to get along to clean some things up. They spend most of the time arguing, and Allen makes it in a way that spectator doesn't get tired, considering they have funny ironic lines. The only thing that I disliked was the acting of Helen Hunt and Dan Aykroyd; don't get me wrong, I'm not stating they are bad actors, but in some scenes they are simply unconvincing, even overacting sometimes. In the end, it's a great movie, and happens to be one of those few cases in which a remake would be really useful. Recommended, and from now on I'll try to see other Allen's works.

The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, released in 2001, is so full of little cinematic delights that it doesn't really matter if the film isn't regarded as the highlight of Woody Allen's career. After more than 30 films, Allen is more than allowed to give himself a break, and although I read he considered the film one of his worst, I wouldn't be surprised if in the years to come, The Curse gains more popularity, as I see it, it's got all the ingredients to become a cult-classic.The 2000's were a mixed year for Woody Allen, but the recent successes of Vicky Cristina Barcelona and especially Midnight for Paris spoke very eloquently for a revival of Woody Allen's international prestige, for the fan's great satisfaction, the little neurotic guy with glasses still got it. But for myself, there's something that attracts me more to a 'little' film like The Curse of Jade Scorpion than these last Oscar-material successes, tailor-made to please European film-critics and God knows how they can get pompous or overly enthusiastic when it comes to Woody Allen, and take it from a fan. Of course, we all love to be taken off- guard by an established film-maker but when you get tired of the whole love letters to Barcelona, to Paris and this year to Rome, you start looking at the less ambitious comedies as very endearing little gems. After Small Time Crooks, The Curse of Jade Scorpion provides another example of Woody's talent to make great little films, even greater because they remind of his earlier slapstick films before the more artistically oriented 80's.But let's get back to 2001, to The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. The film's premise is one of these simple yet very creative ideas, like imagining a fictional character getting off-screen and discovering the real life or a man meeting at midnight the writers and artists that made Paris' history. Woody Allen wondered what if someone could get hypnotized in order to commit a crime and not remembering it, what if this guy gets involved in the investigation. From a simple comedic premise based on the idea of a perfect crime, the other elements of the story come up very naturally, what if the hero is an insurance investigator? How to make the curse start? How about a stage hypnotist show? Then what best way to prove that it works by taking two persons strongly hating each other, and then through the magical power of hypnosis, they suddenly falls in love. Bingo, you have your romantic subplot, the perfect crime, and the design to remind of the Golden Age of film-noir.Woody Allen is C.W. Briggs, a talented insurance investigator and Helen Hunt is Betty Ann Fitzgerald, the new efficient expert, she's sometimes too sophisticated or too modern to be believable as a woman of the 40's, even if her performance is meant to remind of Rosalind Russell or Katharine Hepburn, but anyways. Fitz and Briggs hate each other so much that we know that they would end up together, although she's closer to Barbara Stanwyck than he is to Fred MacMurray. The reference to Double Indemnity is more than intentional, but would you imagine Edward G. Robinson involved in a romance? Well, I can buy anything a movie would if as a screwball comedy, it provides the right laughs. Although the scenes are unequally funny, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion benefits from great casting, Dan Aykroyd and Wallace Shawn play their part with nuance and a little comedic something I couldn't put my finger in, even Elizabeth Berkeley was believable as the sexy secretary. But it's Charlize Theron that provides the best bits of dialog with Allen, as the obligatory femme-fatale.And then there's the plot, both Briggs and Fitz can be 'programmed' when they hear two magical words, respectively 'Constantinople' and 'Madagascar'. When Briggs hears 'Constantinople', he instantly gets under the hypnotist's control and executes any of his orders, which all of them include stealing and hiding jewels. It works as a great running gag, carried by a catchy guitar music, the little tone that sticks in your mind after the film ends, you may think it's a detail but the enjoyment of a film is made of little details you wouldn't suspect. And that's probably why some reviewers were more severe about the film, while it was good in our book, by Allen's standards, it could have been better. I also think the film would have fit a shorter length or that some parts were redundant while the resolution was a bit too abrupt, well, I can't disagree with these reactions. I also think there was much more to do with the magical words, but again saying a film could have been better doesn't make it bad. Indeed, even a filmmaker like Woody Allen is not committed to perfection, and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion remains enjoyable from beginning to start. Perhaps, my only regret is that Woody Allen didn't make the film earlier when he was at the top of his game in terms of writing and acting. He had a fabulous chemistry with Helen Hunt, but even for Woody Allen, it's difficult not be distracted by their age difference. Briggs was a bit too old, and I'm sure the film, had it been written in the 70's would have featured smarter jokes, hell, I can even imagine Diane Keaton playing in Helen Hunt's part. Still a good film, with a great casting, great design and great use of music.

With Small Time Crooks and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, however, Allen entered the biggest slump of his career, the only period in which his reputation was seriously at stake, and he wouldn't recover from it until he began his journeys to Europe, starting with 2005's Match Point.The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is, indeed, one of Allen's weakest films; not because it's a strict comedy (he made quite a few of those, many of them - even the latter ones - quite good; I'm one of the few people who actually enjoyed Scoop) but simply because it's not good. Allen doesn't feel at home with his role at all, more than ever playing not a character but himself stuck with a gig as an insurance investigator; it's impossible to buy him as the hard-boiled womanizer. Worse is his on-screen chemistry with Helen Hunt - there is none. We as viewers know there's sexual tension between them only because, in films, there always is between co-workers of opposite sexes who hate each other - but none of it shows up in their performances. There's also no chemistry between Hunt and Dan Aykroyd, whose character is a completely flat waste.The film is not all bad, of course, it's Woody Allen and therefore has entertainment value. The script is smart and often funny, and whenever it gets self-conscious and turns into a film-noir parody it works pretty well, but it never goes far enough in that direction. The ending, for example, feels like a complete cop out; were it self aware and self mocking, like the ending to Shadows and Fog, it would have worked, but it just feels like Allen didn't know how to finish his film. All too often it feels like he just didn't know what he was doing, and that means that even the good scenes couldn't be enjoyed completely.

A magician, Voltan (David Odgen Stiers) hypnotizes the two office enemies, CW and Betty Ann, into, briefly, thinking they are married and on their honeymoon. The key words to set them off are Constantinople for CW and Madagascar for BA. When Voltan snaps his fingers, the victims both come out, with no memories. Neither believes the story of what just happened to them. However, Holy Toledo! That night, Voltan phones CW and uses his magic word to order the investigator to break into one of their own clients' home and steal valuable jewels. CW is powerless to resist and has no idea of what he is doing, but completes the theft. Next day, the company is aghast and asks Briggs to seek the truth! Ho, ho! Going to the wealthy estate of the gems' owners, CW meets the gorgeous young daughter, Laura (Charlize Theron) and convinces her to step out with him. But, when they end up back at Briggs' place, where he gets another phone call from Voltan, Laura is astounded to be kicked out of bed before any action! Nevertheless, Briggs commits another hypnotic robbery. So, will CW be found out? Will Laura forgive him? Or, could Betty Ann possibly lose interest in Chris and cast her eyes on the man she loathes, Briggs, even as she receives a phone call from Voltan, too? This is no curse of a film at all, being hysterically funny, unless you have broken ribs. It is definitely one of Allen's best recent movies, with an arsenal of memorable lines. Also, Woody does a great acting turn, as does the rest of the very fine cast which includes, besides those mentioned above, Elizabeth Berkley and Wallace Shawn. Then, too, the zany plot is well-imagined and conceived while the film's look, a recreation of the 40's era, has great costumes, sets, and amenities. Kudos to Allen's great comedic direction as well. In short, even the most jaded soul is likely to laugh at this fine flick so grab it soon.

If you don't, this won't be one that makes you a fan, but I do think it will pass a couple of hours in an entertaining fashion. For the fan, this has to be enjoyed as a great period piece that has a high motor, ploughing through the dead spots while retaining a few signature Woody insights into the deeper questions of truth, evidence, love, desire that he has always returned to. Great acting, sets, cinematography all around.I find it quite ironic that the IMDb review channel features discussion of the Woody / Soon_yi situation as appalling, while at the same time romance between a Woody in his 60s and the female leads in this film somehow should be untenable. A consistent theme of his films (that he would later, unfortunately, stage in real life) is that love always surprises us and is not reducible to rational calculation. Perhaps in some ways this is his deepest and truest insight as a film-maker, even as I have to hold my stomach at his real-life moves. But the moral core in his films, even from this period, is stronger than 99% of what gets made today.

With this in mind, I thought I might be in for another evening of Woody Allen-style neurotic mental masturbation, but alas, I was treated to a an evening of an entertaining, if at times topical, movie.This kind of movie makes you ask what you want in a movie.  Do you want a mental-twister a la Memento, or do you want something that is more for sheer entertainment value?  Granted, Woody Allen as a halfway romantic lead might not have been the best choice, but who else is going to play a hapless schlep in this case?  How could some of the jokes and comments work if it was Tom Selleck playing his role?  The scene where Charlize Theron's character tells him why she likes him was absolutely priceless and had me rolling with out-loud laughter.  Her little rambling was so perfectly dead-panned, making so obvious how odd it was that he was the eventual yin to Helen Hunt's yang.  (C'mon folks, the scenes at the end where he's telling Helen Hunt that maybe he CAN actually make her feel the way she was saying she felt about him while under trance were really good. He was such a ne'er-do-well hoping for more.  Wonderful.)With this in mind, the key to this movie is not too ask too much of it. It is not going to offer you a grand philosophy on life, nor is it a cerebral film in the sense of an intense whodunit because you know whodunit.  The joy is in the characters and their interactions.  The fun is in seeing Woody Allen's character get a beautiful woman (and might I say that Helen Hunt looked great in this film).  If you are looking for a Sixth Sense plot twist ending, go look somewhere else.This movie was entertaining, no more no less.  It may not be for everyone and I wouldn't recommend it to just anyone.

Allen plays the homage game for laughs this time -- not necessarily as a period comedy, but a mild send-up of homage/period pieces.  The plot is cute, and telegraphed just enough so we see one turn ahead, which is the best way to avoid having to think about the movie, and instead concentrate on the moment, the scene, instead.Allen plays an an old-style gumshoe for an insurance company.  Supposedly, he is top of the game, though obviously even within the movie, it isn't true -- he really has no clue.  (Tips from a fake blind man.  Somehow discovering a lost painting without any idea how he actually found it.)Hunt plays a brass tacks woman, the kind who a set-in-his-ways Allen is bound to hate.  (Anyone see the self mocking here?)  OK, this was telegraphed way ahead, but just in case ***SPOILER*** they're gong to hate each other until the last few scenes, then be madly in love.  The fireworks are real, but only on film.  (OK, that's a second spoiler, but way to obscure...)They are put together by a manipulative hypnotist (plot hole how'd he know?), and they end up looking for thieves, who ***LAST SPOILER*** turn out to be themselves.Many fans are turned off, because Allen breaks no significant new ground here, but his goal seems to be a little but off-beat within his standard set of off-beat mannerisms.  For example, each of Hunt's  parting lines is worse (and much longer) than the last, but there's a rhythm to them, and I don't think it was chance.  They are purposely corny, cornier, corniest, start out mildly funny, and work toward exasperating.  The whole movie is like that, always being one note off your expectations, until you catch the rhythm. Throw in some very funny lines (there should have been a few more), and you get an immensely enjoyable movie.  The soured fans need to stop looking so hard -- not because they need to cut the film slack, but because it isn't intended to be what they expect.Stiers plays the hypnotist.  Or should I say, plays the hypnotist's voice? Good, but not much to look at.Theron is only so-so.  She's the only one plays archetype instead of archetype-with-a-skewer.  (This is your kind of thing, it will look great on your resume.)Berkley is cute as the inaccessible-accessible secretary.  She needs more character roles like this to make Showgirls disappear.I really like the agency detectives... the inconsistency in how good/how bad they are could be a synopsis of how this film is meant to work.

Well worth seeing, as the only criticism is that maybe Woody Allen is getting a bit old to be the romantic lead with young actresses; but this is a minor matter in what is otherwise a good comedy-romance-thriller. They say there's nothing new under the sun, and it's hard to make a movie which is entirely without recycled ideas, whether these ideas have been spontaneously produced or consciously recast. For example, Woody plays C.W.Briggs, an insurance fraud investigator who solves his cases by putting himself into the mind of the criminal.  This attitude was mooted years ago by a character created by that great crime fiction writer, Edgar Wallace, in his book The Mind of Mr.J.G.Reeder.  Reeder worked in the Public Prosecutor's Office, and was a tall, thin, seemingly benign person - but was really as deadly as a mamba.  He constantly deplored the fact that I see wrong in everything. ...I have a criminal mind. Again, the battle-of-the-sexes in this film was anticipated much earlier in a movie of that name (1960), starring Peter Sellers as a mild-mannered and  conservative Scottish clerk, whose clothing firm is invaded by a female American efficiency expert, whose efforts Sellers tries to sabotage - but he ends up falling romantically for his enemy.  However, none of this detracts from the film, and it is hypnosis which is the core element, producing the main problem for Briggs and Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt).  How this is resolved is the source of most of the humour and suspense. Dan Aykroyd is Briggs' boss, Chris Magruder, in the insurance company, with romantic entanglement with Fitzgerald; while the glamorous Charlize Theron is Laura Kensington, a rich good-time girl.  All is set in 1940, and the year is recreated quite authentically.   For good entertainment, don't miss this movie.  "},{"Title":"Excellent, for the right tastes","Date":"30 March 2002","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":"  A good storyteller transports you to a different world.  A sophisticated reader/watcher/hearer appreciates the intellect involved in that transport. If I am going to be transported to another realm, I want to travel with one who completely understands that world right down to the seemingly insignificant details (as Woody Allen does in this film).  Every part of a good story fits together perfectly, and every element of the story must be congruent with the universe of that story. `The Curse of the Jade Scorpion' is just such a story, and film.If it bothers some that Betty Ann (Helen Hunt) could fall for C. W. Briggs (Woody), then the problem is with the personal choices of those viewers, not with the movie.  Many viewers would prefer that the heroine choose a Mel Gibson or a Brad Pitt sort of hero, but that's because they are programmed by so many popular movies these days.  Plenty of women in this world see past looks and age when they make their choices in men.  Betty Ann is just such a woman.  She has had a bad marriage experience, perhaps with a handsome, younger man, and she is now ready for a more mature relationship. Some feel that Woody is too old for the part of C. W. Briggs, but IMO, Woody is the perfect choice for this character, and he is in excellent form here. (Ageism is just as bad as racism, but more acceptable in our outside world.) C. W. Briggs is the typical `offbeat Everyman' sort of character that Woody often plays.  He's not supposed to be a pretty boy.  Too many movies are jam-packed with pretty boys and young studs.  If I want to view handsome, young studs, there are a million other movies out there to choose from. If I want class and sophistication, I watch Woody.This is not to say that all of Woody's movies are wonderful, because, as with all film people, he's had a few duds.  However, Jade Scorpion is one of his better films.  It has the right actors in the right parts, even in the cases of Dan Aykroyd as Chris Magruder and Elizabeth Berkley as Jill. Santo Loquasto's production design is superb.  Zhao Fei's cinematography is perfect, with all the right shadows and light, camera angles, points of view to fit the moods of the various scenes.  The sets, costumes, other visual effects, and music are perfect for transporting the viewer to the 1940's romantic mystery world.  I have to add that I love watching Charlize Theron, and she played a great Laura Kensington.The plot, whose archetypes and values mimic a 1940's style mystery movie, is perfectly executed.  Zoltan is the perfect 1940's style villain. Historical notions about the powers of hypnosis, which were greatly exaggerated, are perfectly exploited in this film.  Certainly we `intelligent people of the 2000's know that hypnosis doesn't work like that, but in the 1940's it was quite believable.  If the unbelievable is congruent in the universe of the story, and if the creators make it believable, then so what if it isn't believable in our reality.  If we can suspend our disbelief to temporarily accept starship transporters, time travel, light swords, driving cars among dinosaurs, and other movie conventions, then we should have no trouble believing in this magical version of Zoltan's hypnotic powers.  This film is not realistic because it is not meant to be, any more than Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.In spite of the wonders of computer animation, robotics, amazing visual effects, incredible sound, and all the other newer conventions of today's films, it is still very difficult to find really enjoyable movies.  Jade Scorpion is one of those few really good ones, an amazing transport to another world, the 1940's cinema mystery world.  It has flavor, intrigue, lots of humor--particularly in quick one-liners, some of which are dated (deliberately) but nevertheless fit perfectly in that milieu--colorful characters, lovely costumes, and it is just plain fun.If you only enjoy movies that have car chases, explosions, lots of explicit sex and grisly violence, loud rock music, macho heroes, characters who constantly use the word `fuck,' and lots of naked bimbos, then please don't go to see Jade Scorpion, because you probably won't like it.The conventions of this movie are much more subtle.  To really appreciate it, one must not see it with any preconceived notions about what to expect. It must be seen and enjoyed with a relaxed attitude, and it helps to have an admiring understanding of the 1940's films from which its world derives. It's one of those films that our household members enjoyed so much, we could see it again and again.

Where does he find the coffeepots, the sequined turban?  It probably all comes from growing up in the late 40's to early 50's.

There was nothing else on worth watching and we had always considered Woody Allen films to be a bit risky so it was quite a courageous choice on our part.  Woody Allen has the tendency to make the kind of films no other director would normally conceive to make.  Partly because they may sometimes be the kind of films no film studio would be willing to support financially, or either because the plot seems too crazy to make into a watchable film. Because of this tendency, Allen can sometimes hit his mark with precision and make immensely enjoyable films like Annie Hall (1977) and my favourite, Manhattan Murder Mystery (1988). At the same time Allen can also make some abysmal mish-mash of films like Celebrity (1997) and Deconstructing Harry (1998).In The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, Allen has created a comedy/mystery whose plot resembles something somewhat belonging to perhaps a Scooby Doo cartoon, or maybe one of those detective novels that 11-14 year olds read.  Allen plays C.W.Briggs, a gumshoe investigator who works for an insurance fraud company, and whose latest case involves a series of jewellery thefts cleverly engineered by a professional hypnotist Zoltan Polgar (David Ogden-Stiers).  Allen is joined by a splendid cast once again, this time with Helen Hunt who plays Betty Ann Fitzgerald, Dan Aykroyd, Charlize Theron and many other notable actors.  Wallace Shawn also makes an appearance, Fezzini the Sicilian from Rob Reiner's classic The Princess Bride (1986). It seems like every actor or actress in Hollywood wants to be in a Woody Allen film - perhaps an indication that Allen's craftmanship while not considered popular film studio material is generally regarded in such high esteem by the acting profession.  I think also they have more fun in Allen's films, I don't know where else Helen Hunt can dress up in a 1950s red outfit and carry a cigarette in her hand like one of those femme fatale characters that appeared in the film noir of that period.I found the movie to be hilarious, my partner and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I laughed out loud several times, I especially liked the line Look I don't want to say I didn't enjoy it but I didn't or Paris? the actual city?. You could almost sense that the actors were making fun of it while they were playing their parts.  The Curse of the Jade Scorpion was a very fun movie to watch and although it was not probably what you would consider a masterpiece it was nevertheless a fun film, and in effect cured a night of potentially absolute boredom.  Allen, who makes a successful return to acting in his own movies after a couple of years, is classic Allen, quick-witted one-liners accompanied by what you would describe as exasperating body movement.  And there's a catchy jazzy score to go with it. My only criticism for the movie would be that although Helen Hunt does an excellent job playing her character, I think, without giving too much away, it would have better sense in terms of the story's plausability if the character of Betty Ann Fitzgerald was played by someone like Diane Keaton.You should go watch this movie bearing in mind Woody Allen's creative flair for making the kind of movies that really he wants to make for his own self-interest rather than what big Hollywood film studios would generally be interested in, which is, in other words, movies that most intelligent people would appreciate.  If you are going to go watch this, then go with a relaxed laid-back attitude, with the expectation that the film is exactly what the title suggests, the product of a sixty year old kid's imagination.

He can always be counted on to make us laugh with his neurotic persona and his snappy writing. In his latest outing, THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION, he doesn't disappoint. C.W. Briggs (Allen himself) is an insurance investigator in the 1940's. He has just found the Missing Pacasso. He works with Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt). They loathe each other (Would you like to go out and try coming in like a human being? she asks when Briggs bursts into her office. If you don't like the human being idea, come in like an orangutan. That would be a step up, too.) She is the efficiency expert at the office. When Briggs and Fitzgerald and some others are at a birthday party, they volunteer to be the victims of the Great Voltan (David Ogden Stiers), a magician. He puts the two under a spell. He gives each a special word to go under hypnosis. Briggs' is Constantinople and Fitzgerald's is Madagascar. He does some amusing tricks with the two and the party ends and they go home. That night Briggs gets a call. The first word he hears is Constantinople. It's Voltan calling. Briggs is under his command. Voltan tells him to steal the jewels from the Kensington estate and when he wakes up in the morning he won't remember a thing. So now, Briggs is after the jewel thief. But little does he know it's him. Also in the mix is Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd), whom Fitzgerald is having an affair with. And there's the sexy Laura Kensington (Charlize Theron), daughter of the jewel victims.The funny thing is Woody Allen just about 66 years old and he can still pick up women like Theron and Hunt. I hope I'm that lucky when I'm 66. Anyway, I liked the way Allen plays this character... like every other character he's played. We love him just the way he is and he doesn't need to change. He always has fresh, funny, and original movies. Even in ANTZ, he was a form of himself.JADE SCORPION is written with a sting. It's a clever story involving great characters that we can learn to love. The daily bloodbath between C.W. and Betty Ann are always amusing. I love all the different names she has for him. I am also highly recommending this movie because it's a simple comedy without gross-out sex humor and trash talk. Allen proves he can be funny even in a time where humping pies is the top form of comedy.THE CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION is a fresh piece of cinema with humor, charm, and romance. It's a fun film to watch and is always pleasant and up-beat.Note I am so glad that Allen pays so much attention to detail for this movie. It feels like it was filmed in the 1940's and held back for release in 2001. Every little thing is set to get the tone of the movie. And, of course, the jazz music is superb.

The plot works, the atmosphere is excellent and Woody Allen is able to play his age reasonably well despite romancing a much younger co-star.  The dialogue is uneven; overwritten in some places and underwritten in others.  Kudos to Allen for writing a decent female roll that can effectively spar with his own character.  Helen Hunt performs well as do much of the supporting cast (especially favourite character actors Wallace Shawn and David Ogden Stiers).  Dan Ackroyd, unfortunately, is woefully miscast in a roll better suited to Alec Baldwin or Rob Lowe and, as a result, the romantic triangle in the film is never convincing.There are a few shortcomings in the plot that could have been fixed in a rewrite but the story moves along well and laughs are delivered regularly throughout.  Woody would have been well advised to take one last run at polishing the script (or even bringing in a thorough editor) but these days who can give Woody Allen that kind of advise?It's nice to see Allen returning to lighter comic fare and this film is worth seeing on a discount night or would be just as effective on video.

In this particular effort, Woody Allen has cast 3 incredible babes Charlize Theron as the bad little rich girl sex siren (a Veronica Lake/Lauren Bacall type); Elizabeth Berkley as the innocent but sexy office secretary; and Helen Hunt as the smart girl who is just bubbling with repressed sensuality. With this going for it, Curse is off to a good start. Woody Allen stars as a 1940 insurance investigator at odds with the company's new efficiency expert (Hunt). On a night out to celebrate fellow investigator John Shuck's birthday, they are both hypnotized by a nightclub entertainer, played with flair by David Ogden Stiers. What seems like a harmless stunt soon turns in to a crime wave as the evil hypnotist keeps Allen under hypnosis to commit crimes. When he is awake, he has no memory of what happened, so as he investigates, Allen has no idea he's on the trail of himself. Easily the best scene in the movie comes when Charlize Theron, playing the spoiled daughter of one of the victims, meets Allen. She totally gets her 1940's character and steals the show.  But she has an advantage. Besides being INCREDIBLY HOT, her part is well written and has a definite point of view. If only the rest of Jade Scorpionwas as good. Instead, the movie has one foot in the 1940's and the other in the present. Hunt seems horribly miscast, but may just be the victim of a part that was not clearly written to the genre. Ditto for Dan Aykroyd, who seems curiously restrained in his part as the head of the insurance company and Hunt's secret lover. One can only speculate on what someone like the late Phil Hartman would have done with such a part. Instead, Aykroyd comes off flat. Strangely enough, Woody Allen himself seems to be a little out of character at times. For the first ten minutes of this picture, he appeared to be walking through the film merely doing a mild impression of himself. Elizabeth Berkley,of course has the most to be thankful for. By picking this fine figured woman off the ash heap of Showgirls, Allen has given her credibility as an actress again. After all, if a director as talented as Woody Allen gives her a major part in a film, she can't be all bad, right? I'm sure she was most grateful. Charlize Theron, of course is the one WE have to be most thankful for. She is the highlight of the picture. Who knew she could be so funny while being so sexy! Yes! Helen Hunt, unfortunately must have just gotten off the set of What Women Want, because she pretty much plays the same character she did in that Mel Gibson vehicle. She gives us no sense of time and place. As for the rest of the picture, it is slow and uneven at best. Woody still can do a solid joke when he wants to. Trouble is, he seems satisfied to get by with texas league singles instead of playing home run derby. A lot of the jokes fall flat. The direction is slow and the music, while appropriate for a Woody Allen film, did not seem right at all for a film of this 1940's genre. But perhaps Allen was looking for something else, and not a straight aping of those genre pictures. If he was, he should've kept looking. Perhaps even a filmmaker as gifted as Allen could not overcome the pictures title, Curse of the Jade Scorpion. As far as I know, every movie with the word Curse in it has been cursed, or at least disappointing at best. These range from last year's Curse of the Vampire to the posthumously produced Curse of the Pink Panther, the unfunny Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen and any number of shlocky horror films like Curse of King Tut's Tomb (with Raymond Burr), Curse of Frankenstein (A Cushing-Lee snorefest) or Curse of the Fly, the sequel to the sequel Return of the Fly.

Another score for Woody!","Date":"3 September 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":"  A week ago, I went to see Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, which I must say is the filthiest movie ever made.  Nothing but dirty jokes and tons of profanity.  The kind of film that simply shows the decline in cinematic society, rather than the advancement.  Watching The Curse of the Jade Scorpion I was relieved.  I've always been a fan of Woody and though this is not a hysterically funny comedy that will deliver a laugh a minute, it delivers good, honest laughs and that's what I appreciated most about it.  If we were living in the 1940's or 50's, a comedy like this would be no big deal.  Actors and actresses in those eras knew how to make people laugh, without even uttering a minute sexual reference.  Because they were professionals and they were talented and they knew what comedy was all about.  Despite heavy regulations on censorship, they delivered hilarious gags with the greatest of ease.  Showing us it isn't the least bit necessary to use sex or bodily functions to make audiences laugh.  COJS is like an old-fashioned comedy and it happens to be set in the dawning of the 1940's. For all you Woodyphiles expecting those grand Woody zingers--you won't be disappointed.  One of his biggest gifts is witty dialogue.  In this movie the dialogue is not only witty, but incredibly intelligent.  So even if this is not the funniest movie ever, I'm certainly not going to say this is one of Woody's minor works.  The chemistry--or should I say, non-chemistry--between Woody and Helen Hunt (his nemesis) is sharp.  They build up a great tension--angry and sexual.  I also liked the sexual innuendos between Woody and Charlize Theron, who plays the seductive Laura Kensington.  Some say that Woody purposely wrote those scenes into the script so that he can have a couple of steamy scenes with the beautiful actress; I think not.  The innuendos between them are very honest and she even admits at one point that she's used to strong, muscular men.  Those scenes between Woody and Charlize are some of the film's funniest moments. I'm guessing Woody used a slightly bigger budget that usual to produce this comedy, which you can consider a period piece.  He really brings out a great aura of 1940's New York.  Of course, I wasn't around during that time period, so I can't exactly scribble down every anachronism on a notepad and submit them in the goofs section.  But judging by films I've watched, which took place during that era, I think the look was dead-on. The film runs just a little long, and it slightly drags at points, but overall it's a feel-good romantic comedy with a good heart.  There are even some good moments of mystery, which kept me intrigued.  I liked the ending, which wasn't forced at all.  It was an imaginative conclusion that suited the fate of the two leads, and it made me smile.  Nothing like a typical Hollywood ending.  This is the kind of sharp writing that existed before the film industry became a haven for money-hungry shysters.  I admire Woody for continuing to make films that don't appeal to any particular demographic.  This is a zestfully clean PG-13 comedy that probably won't do wonders at the box office, because there's no crude or sex-related humor, no nudity and no profanity--but Woody's an artiste and he's not about to let this explosion of gross-out comedies affect his integrity as one of our most talented writer/directors.  If your IQ is in the double-digits, this probably won't be the film for you.  I know (most) young people aren't used to thinking when they watch a comedy, so they may as well pass on this one and save themselves from a migraine.  But for those in the mood for a fun, adult comedy--brace yourself for the Jade Scorpion.  Comedies like this are becoming extinct--may as well watch as many of them as you can before they banish completely.

One of the most brilliant things about this movie is the lighting, and cinematography by Zhao Fei, who also worked with Allen in Sweet and Lowdown, and who was also responsible for two of the most beautiful films I've ever seen (Kaige's 'The Emperor and the Assassin', and Yimou's 'Raise the Red Lantern'). The use of mirrors and reflections on the glass was also kinda nice. Most of the scenes, like in the insurance company office, were filmed with a sepia filter this and the lighting reminds me a lot of Hou Hsiao-Hsien's 'Flowers Of Shanghai', another one of those most beautiful films. The dialogue, especially from Woody Allen's character, is as always in his films, witty and funny, even more so than most of his films in the past five years. Oh, and the soundtrack is also great. I'm not sure if there was some from Woody's regular jazz band, but I hope so. For film-lovers, look out for the two references to Frederico Fellini (1) The hypnotism scene, like in 'Nights of Cabiria', and (2) Laura Kensington's reference to 'jumping into publuc fountains', which reminds me, of that famous scene in 'La Dolce Vita'. The plots is twisted and labyrinthine as some of Woody's better films, and the acting is, as usual, brilliant. Overall, this is an excellent film. I won't claim that there is something new in it, but most of the things were exquisitely executed.

It is an amusing premise, but done in a horribly heavy-handed manner.  It looks gorgeous.  The art decoration, cinematography and the jazz sound track are all terrific.  But the cast is all wrong!  Wood is far too old for his role.  He was too old for this role 10 years ago.  Helen Hunt is a good actress and has a great body, but there is nothing 1940s about her.  She is a creature from the Twenty-First Century who seems to have done some time traveling.  The movie is basically `cute', although many of Woody's one-liners fall flat.  Among the Woody Allen canon I'd rate this one somewhere slightly below the halfway point.  (I put Annie Hall, Broadway Danny Rose, Bullets Over Broadway and Hannah and Her Sisters at the top; at the bottom Everyone Says I Love You, Shadows and Fog, and September.  I would place this one in about the same category as Radio Days and Alice.)  The movie is also far too long.  The basic idea is enough to fill out a half hour situation comedy.

Helen Hunt's character was very interesting. She was quite a straight arrow for all intents and purposes.  However, she still had to indulge herself with a little fling on the side, with her boss, a rather lifeless office drone played by Dan Akroyd.  Hunt's character-Fitzgerald-reminded me of Hot Lips Hoolahan on M*A*S*H.  On that show she was the high priestess of morality and decency; except when she and Frank engaged in a fairly torrid affair.  Helen Hunt carries off the role extremely well.  She is a very restrained actress.  She knows that less is more and she doesn't belabor points.I found the first half hour or so of the film quite slow, but after that, the film's conceit-that CW and Fitzgerald acted differently in the wake of their hypnotization-took hold and I found it quite funny.   The plot turns on the idea that CW and Fitzgerald have been hypnotized by a man, initially at a party for a co-worker, and then in phone calls.  They rob houses when he requests them to, and then can remember none of it the next day.  And, as investigators, they have to try to solve the crimes. Therefore of course, the trail is cold to them, although they will be viewed suspiciously due to various items that point to them.  They are investigating themselves but don't even know it.  They honestly deny having committed the crimes and are shocked to be accused.  Eventually of course, the scheme is unravelled. Woody Allen played a very unusual character for him.  Well, not really, he played himself once again.  If you haven't enjoyed his films before, you probably won't enjoy this one.  But his writing is as glib and witty as always.On another MASH related note, David Ogden Stiers portrays the man who hypnotizes Woody and Helen for his own ends.  He didn't have quite the same blueblood accent as he did in MASH but the eyes and the voice were fairly unmistakeable.  Dan Akroyd's acting was excellent as a rather dull office manager.  Charlize Theron was all legs and breasts as a spoiled rich girl, and Shannon Elizabeth had nothing much to do except tease her helpless co-workers.  One can never tell why Woody casts these parts.  Is he interested in creating that role due to its importance to the film, or does he just like working with young pretty actresses?Nevertheless, the film is very enjoyable and I would implore you not to fear the bite of the Scorpion.

Forget the jade scorpion that could give you riches, power and enormous control over your friends or better, your enemies. Woody has beautiful starlets (Charize Theron), maturing Dames (Helen Hunt) and former showgirls (Elizabeth Berkley) willing to drop their commitments to make far more just to appear in this master's film. Then of course there's the opportunity to play out Woody's fantasies. How we suffer for our art. This formulaic Allen comedy has more vintage standup lines than three of his last offerings. Woody why have you waited so long? Close your eyes and imagine the skinny, self-conscious former writer delivering subtle self-deprecation. Now you've got it. Take me back to the '40's New York, Big Band, black coupes, fedoras and a pre-politically-correct era allowing us to wisecrack, lust and gaze without sanction. I think Mr. Allen pines for this freedom from humorless judgment and liberation from censors on either side of the political spectrum.  But I project. CW Biggs and Miss Betty Ann Fitzgerald have a serious love-to-hate relationship. They're natural enemies as the intelligent, progressive, scientific-management insultant vs. practical, intuitive, seat-of the pants working stiff who's success taunts Betty Ann. Woody delivers his lines flawlessly and Ms. Hunt deserves credit for a stretch performance. Her earlier award winning jobs prepared her well for the non-stop repartee demanded by the script. I'm reminded of a classic bit by Monty Python of the chartered accountant wanting to be a lion tamer. What's more exciting than the life of an insurance investigator? (remember Memento?) Next we'll see the thrilling escapades of a career counselor. What is Hollywood projecting? Are there any other characters of note? There's the usual collection of performers who feed Woody and his lover/hater set-up lines to build the plot. Dan Ackroyd is at his sleazy best and Wallace Shawn inspires sympathy, Charlize Theron is believable and David Ogden Stiers mesmerizes us. But why did we really spend our 10 bucks and two hours? This film may amuse, annoy or revive your spirits. The old Woody is back. If it took a scorpion bite, it was worth it.

Second, as usual for an Allen film, the casting is brilliant. Not just the leads, but the supporting players such as John Schuck and Wallace Shawn and even Professor Irwin Corey in a small but significant role. Dan Aykroyd underplays his role as the philandering insurance company head (who inherited his position and is thus spoiled) perfectly, clipping his lines and controlling his emotions the way such a character would. Third, unlike some Allen films, this actually has an exciting plot that kept us going right up until the end. Fourth, I was expecting to dislike Allen's character based on the reviews I read here, but the script (and the acting) undercut CW Briggs' (Allen) character's romantic appeal so much that the women are falling all over Allen charge doesn't stick here. Fifth, the romantic coda after the mystery has been solved is certainly NOT 20 minutes long, maybe about 7, and it was charming and gave the film a sweet quality. After some of the sleazy, sex- obsessed Allen films of the 90s, this was a welcome relief! Sixth, the writing was witty and fresh and never predictable. In summary, this is a wonderful little film that should appeal to a broad audience, combining mystery and laughs, and is a classic comedy worthy of a Harry Langdon or a Bob Hope. Woody Allen has definitely still got it and he is to be commended for making two films in a row with such mainstream drawing power while still retaining all those uniquely Allen elements. Anyone who has ever found the Woody Allen persona funny should get out to the theatre and see this beautifully photographed and beautifully set film on the big screen!

Allen's comedic gem set in 1940 about an insurance investigator, C. W. Briggs (Allen), and his map cap relations with Betty-Anne Fitzgerald (Hunt) is a glorious satirical comedy.  Allen, very sophisticatedly, interrupts the crime story with wonderful bits on love and all of its classifications.  Charlize Theron plays, with exuberance and sexiness, a mysterious smoking dam that tempts Allen's character; her character represents lust.  Dan Aykroyd pays the chief detective who cheats on his wife, whom we never see, with Fitzgerald; this character represents hopeless love.  Everything is surrounded around a delightful crime story full of magic and suspense.  Briggs and Fitzgerald cannot stand each other in reality, but, when put under the curse of the jade scorpion, they fall for each other (but not at the same time).  Allen suggests that true, pure love is not possible in reality.  True love is the victim of magic!  Therefore, love is magic.  There is a wonderful scene where Briggs and Fitzgerald embrace each other and fireworks begin to fly!  As a metaphor on love, this scene is perfect! But here's the good part the dialogue.  Allen's dialogue is the most witty he was written in years!  While it's not laugh out loud comedy every second (although it kind of is), it is still the funniest Allen film since the ones made in the 70's and the best comedy of his since Deconstructing Harry.  At one point, Fitzgerald says to Briggs before entering his room, I'm not going to catch any viruses in there, will I?  He responds, Hunny, viruses wouldn't be able to live in your blood stream.  It's too cold!  The best thing about it is that Allen understands all the jokes, that is why they're realized so well.Only criticism some haphazard explanations bring it down a notch.

The romance doesn't work because the characters never seem to care about each other. They merely fall in love because the movie is over and that's what they're supposed to do. Some of the jokes are clever, thank Heaven, but most of them seem forced and awkward, as if they came from a witty line manual and were put in the scene for that reason only. Not because those people in those situations would believably say them. Even the story lacks originality. Hypnosis situations are nothing new to anyone who watched Gilligan, Dick Van Dyke or Lucy. And maybe it's just me, but I didn't find it that intriguing anyway. The more the concept was utilized, the more annoyed I became.

This commentary will tackle each of these issues. Regarding whether or not Woody Allen should stop playing the lead roles in his own movies; I believe those who say this are uncomfortable with the idea of a 66 year old man having romantic relationships with women in their 30's.  I find this line of thinking to be extremely narrow-minded and stereotypical.  Do all leading male actors have to look like George Clooney or Mel Gibson?  Why can't we accept the fact that yes, some woman are attracted to a person's character (as opposed to their physical appearance,) and that they don't have to look like the typical Hollywood sex symbol?   Furthermore, I belive that critics are deeply offended by Woody marrying his step-daughter, and they seem to hold a personal vendetta against him.  I've read many reviews which have been unnecessarily cruel and harsh against Mr. Allen.  No other film maker would receive reviews that blatantly attack the person rather than the film maker.  It's not fair, and it's unprofessional. Now for the criticism that this film is not as fresh or funny or inspired as his previous films.  I've seen almost every Woody Allen film, and this film is just about on par with the best of them.  It's funny, witty, smart, and yes, inspired.  Critics tend to romanticize the past, and the fact they aren't inspired by Woody's current work is more a reflection of what's going on with them personally rather than with the actual material.  For example, Star Wars was extremely inspiring when I saw it when I was 8 years old, and of course the recent Phantom Menace didn't inspire me much because I'm just not in a position to be inspired by that kind of film.  Does that mean Phantom Menace is less inspiring than Star Wars?  Probably not. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is an excellent comedy with a touching underlying story.  The plot, while a bit hokey, is still interesting and mostly believable.   Forget the critics, see this film and decide for yourself!

And not only that, but they cannot get along for the life of them. One evening, while many members of the company are at a party, Volton (David Ogden Stiers), a magician, hypnotizes Betty Ann and CW with a jade scorpion to make them act as if they're in love. The power of his hypnosis is triggered by a special word for each of the two. When they snap out of it, they go home like nothing's happened. However, since they are still under his curse, Voltan uses his power to command CW and Betty Ann to steal jewels for him, and because they are being hypnotized, they don't even remember what they did by the next morning. But yet another problem breaks through whenever one is hypnotized and the other is with them, the hypnotized one is in love with the other! All this leads to a quirky adventure to discover just who is stealing the Kensington jewels.This movie was enjoyable from beginning to end. I laughed the entire way through. Woody certainly knows how to write a funny script, even after all these years. And his stories rule too. Sure, the age gap between CW and some of the girls that loved him was a bit great, but that could be believable. I mean, look at Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, or Celine Dion and her husband.The acting was wonderful. I don't even need to bother talking about how great Woody was; you know he was great. Helen Hunt also shined, like always. Dan Akroyd as CW's boss and Betty Ann's lover Chris MacGruder was also great, and Charlize Theron was wonderful as Laura Kensington.This film was also good in keeping with the times. I hate it when movies set in historical times get lazy and don't try very hard to stay historically accurate. But The Curse of the Jade Scorpion gave a very realistic portrayal of the '40s.Basically, you can almost never go wrong with Woody Allen.

Briggs. There's no case he hasn't solved, not even the stolen Picasso ingeniously rolled up inside a telescope (It took me five minutes just to find the nose! he quips). But Briggs might be forced to give up bragging rights to being the best in the biz when he sways under the spell of The Jade Scorpion, and finds himself clueless in his most puzzling case to date.The CEO of the company, Chris Magruder (Dan Ackroyd, Pearl Harbor), has hired his mistress, Betty-Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt, What Women Want) as an efficiency expert to make improvements around the office, but all she really succeeds in doing is irritating and upsetting Briggs, who liked things just the way they were. The two verbally spar ala Tracy and Hepburn (while maintaining Allen's signature style) throughout the film. They're attracted to each other, and yet they despise each other. Allen is his usual bumbling anti-hero self, and Hunt, despite some clunker dialogue, holds her own as the brainy bitch (she says to him, I'm smarter, faster and I can see right through you -- you're right to feel threatened by me.).One night, while out on the town with their co-workers, Briggs and Fitzgerald are chosen as volunteers to go onstage with the performing hypnotist Voltan Polgar (David Ogden Stiers, Tomcats). Polgar mesmerizes Briggs and Fitzgerald with a jade scorpion on a string, making them think they are deeply in love. The acting and set-up reminded me very much of an Abbott and Costello skit, but it worked. Because Briggs set up the security systems for the wealthy who insure with his company, Polgar keeps the ruse going after the party is over, using the still-hypnotized Briggs to steal jewelry from those rich clients and bring the goods to him. Of course, Briggs remembers nothing afterwards, and he unknowingly winds up chasing the culprit who is actually himself.Charlize Theron (Wakin' Up In Reno) and Elizabeth Berkeley (Becoming Dick) have small roles -- the former a brazen blond bombshell, the latter a pretty but mousy secretary. Needless to say, Briggs is hot after both of them, and needless to say, he beds neither. He's unwittingly saving himself for the woman he really loves&#133; Fitzgerald. Or is he just under the spell of the Jade Scorpion?While I liked the movie, I did find the stage-production look and feel to be somewhat disconcerting. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion could easily have been a play, and was acted and motioned as such. But, it's pure 40's screwball, with a jazzy feel and silly, funny dialogue. That makes it one of the better Allen offerings of recent years.

Allen's constant fits of stuttering while arguing with office adversary Betty Fitzgerald, played by a surprisingly stilted Helen Hunt, are at best painful to watch. Hunt's performance can't be blamed as most of her screen time is shared with Allen or and equally stiff Dan Aykroyd, who plays Chris Magruder, the owner of the insurance agency who is having an extra-marital affair with Fitzgerald.The bright spots include a bouncy soundtrack obviously influenced by Allen's love for jazz. David Ogden Stiers contributes solid but limited work as Voltan the hypnotist/stage performer who uses his powers for tremendous personal gain.Scorpion is a nice film to see if you are flipping the channels on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

The comic pieces of a fun puzzle are here, but they never quite come together. Allen as a director does some curiously weak work; the fantasy elements of the plot are not expanded upon (the jewel heist scenes are incredibly dull) and it all remains grounded, unable to lift off into the manic highs the material suggests. The hand-picked cast seems to have a good time, although Helen Hunt has done this type of all-business character before. Charlize Theron and (surprisingly) Elizabeth Berkley are both incredibly charming.

But...I know Juliet Taylor is credited with casting Woody Allen movies, but my hunch is that it is the man himself who has the last say.  And somebody needs to tell Woody that he is mis-casting his films into mediocrity!  In particular, it is his casting of women characters that is abysmal (surprise! surprise!)It's been said a million times before, but Woody Allen playing the comic, but still romantic lead to actresses as young as Helen Hunt, Charlize Theron, and Elizabeth Berkley just comes off as laughable.  Is his ego so fragile that he cannot cast a more believable (and usually better) actress in these roles?  It's either that, or cast himself out and put in someone around age 40 in the male lead role (see Celebrity to see that this is the lesser of the alternatives).He did the same thing in his most recent film, HOllywood Ending, where Tea Leoni plays opposite him in the lead.  It's not just the age of these actresses (though that is part of it, he is anywhere from 25 to 45 years older than these women), but also they just don't look the part.  If you MUST pick a younger actress, must she also be blonde and glamourous looking?I can't help but think that Curse of the Jade Scorpion would have been a much better film (and funnier too!) if he had cast someone like Julie Kavner or Tracy Ullman (still younger than Woody, but less glamourous actresses with infinitely more comic talent - see Small Time Crooks and Don't Drink the Water to see how it can work).  Either that or pick someone really close to his age - does he have something against 50+ actresses??  There are plenty of talented and available women out there.  They are surely more talented than the ones he is casting now, and they fit the roles infinitely better.Woody, grow up already, you look silly being told by a beautiful woman of 29 that she'll be your date only if you give her a wedding ring to go with it.  A line like that either comes from an aging spinster desperate to get hitched, or made only to a gorgeous sexy and charismatic man.

I have all of his movies in my collection some of them are masterpieces ('Manhattan' &#150; his greatest movie, 'Zelig', 'The Purple Rose of Cairo' etc.), others are not my favorites (like 'Interiors', 'Another Woman' and 'A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy'), but indeed I am a very suspicious person to comment a Woody Allen's movie. In 'The Curse of the Jade Scorpion', Woody Allen returns to the naive humor of 'Take the Money and Run'. He is an efficient investigator of an insurance company using common sense in the 40's. Helen Hunt is the manager hired to modernize the company and his opponent in the insurance company (later he will find out her other attributions). One day, the insurance team joins after-hours to celebrate the anniversary of one colleague. In the show, Helen Hunt and Woody Allen are both simultaneously hypnotized. In order to avoid a spoiler, I do not dare to go further in the plot. But the situations generated by this hypnosis (in special, the meeting between Woody Allen and Charlize Theron &#150; imagine the situation of the Woody Allen's character being told that he refused Charlize Theron in his bed!!!!) and the funny and insulting dialogs between Woody Allen and Helen Hunt makes this movie a worthy entertainment.

Without a common vision to guide them, those differences can whip you from one world to the other.Thus we have Akroyd's ironic delivery next to Hunt's very clean honesty.

The rest of the cast including Dan Akroyd, Charlize Theron, (the great) Wallace Shawn, John Schuck, and Elizabeth Berkley is great-Woody's surefire direction really helps some of these actors (Theron and Hunt especially) turn in better-than-usual performances. Throw all that in with great production design and some fabulous 30's and 40's era jazz and you've got another swiftly entertaining film.

The Curse of the Jade Scorpion has often been cited as one of Allen's worst(Allen even saying it being his worst) and while I would have said that on first viewing on re-watch definitely not. The ending is over too soon and is a cop-out, a lot of chemistry between the actors is quite bland- non existent between Hunt and Aykroyd- and Dan Aykroyd is completely wasted in an underwritten role. However, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is gorgeously filmed and the costumes and scenery are equally beautiful, one of Allen's better-looking later films. The upbeat and jazzy soundtrack matches the light bouncy mood of the film really well, while the script is very funny and smart with some intelligent touches and Allen's unmistakable style all over it and the story(while meandering towards the end) endears in its light-hearted approach, isn't too dull and doesn't waste its creative premise. The characters are not as relatable or as developed as other Allen films but other than Aykroyd's and to a lesser extent Charlize Theron's they do engage at least and like the script how they're written is distinctive of Woody Allen. Allen's direction hardly flounders and while he is in a way too old for his role he still gives a good account of himself, being purposefully neurotic, touchingly dithery and funny in a way that only he can be. Helen Hunt is wonderful, David Ogden Stiers plays with much lively gusto(if slightly hammy compared to everyone else but this is a case of that not being too much of a bad thing) and Elizabeth Berkley as well as looking beautiful is also surprisingly good. Like Aykroyd, Charlize Theron's character is very underwritten but her witty lines and her being at her sexiest more than compensate and she manages to be memorable at least. Overall, a decent film that could have been stronger but much better than its critical reputation and on re-watch. It's no Annie Hall, Crimes and Misdemeanours, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, Husbands and Wives or The Purple Rose of Cairo and it's not as ground-breaking as Zelig. But it is a long way from Allen's worst, What's Up Tiger Lily, Celebrity, To Rome With Love and Cassandra's Dream are worse, and panned films that I have yet to watch(re-watch in the cases of Shadows and Fog, September and Anything Else, all of which on first viewing didn't impress me) are likely to be even worse than them. 7/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Surprisingly Hilarious!","Date":"12 March 2011","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" I am mostly familiar with Woody Allen's earlier work, such as the goof-ball comedies of the late '60's and early '70's.

I have watched this well over 50 times and I am not lying! That Woody was miscast is an absolute crime to even say. No one could have done it better. Every facial expression, muffed line and jokes that he says are to perfection. His boyish charm is so natural as is his acting. It is non acting actually because it transcends acting - it is him, his essence. Woody is the real thing my friends that is why he is so popular and so loved. I have even come to love his films that do not star himself because I finally realized that all the actors have become him in his films. He is the Beatles of comedy movies. Helen Hunt and he are excellent together! In this day and age there is no loyalty towards teams like in the 60s or 70s (just like sports nowadays). Tony Roberts and Woody were in my opinion one of the best teams and it is a shame that Helen Hunt couldn't team up more with Woody. It is so hard for me to watch Mia Farrow in his past movies now. I tend to just pass up all his Mia movies these days. She bores me to tears! If Woody would ever do a sequel this is the movie to have a part 2! Do not miss this one!

Don't expect some note-perfect pastiche of 40s films - it's a Woody Allen film in costume, with all kinds of anachronisms in style. But it's relentlessly entertaining and there's a rather sweet love story at the bottom - I think it actually owes more to Billy Wilder's 'The Apartment' than to the classic screwball comedies. It's fluff, but likable, uplifting and charming fluff. Contrary to what some have said, both Helen Hunt and Woody are perfect in their roles. The fact that he's old and dilapidated fits the comedy, the romance, and the conventions of the detective genre. Hunt is appealing and does the hard-boiled but vulnerable underneath thing perfectly.

The romance is not very believable in this one, but the characters are well-developed. This film has a good premise involving stolen jewels, 1940's gender roles, and hypnosis. Lacking the surprising twists you might seek in a film about a man investigating a jewel heist, the script even resolves its subplots in a way that viewers might guess. This film also fails to generate as many laughs as Woody's better work. Woody has a few good one-liners, but that's it. Helen Hunt does a good job of playing Woody's workplace nemesis. However, several of her scenes end with her telling Woody how she dreams of his death. (Example Try not to suffer a massive coronary on your way home.) This string of jokes gets real old real fast. Nevertheless, none of the movie really drags. The plot moves at a good pace, and watching things develop is enjoyable. The story is somewhat simple, but it works. And this film is more creative than the average film that was actually made in the 1940's. And I like how the script briefly revisits the roles of women of the 1940's under the light of a modern appreciation for (and understanding of) women. In conclusion, this film is worth seeing if you've already checked out Woody's greatest hits.

Writer & director Allen sets this lightweight tale of larceny and romance in the 1940s. As C.W. Briggs, Allen works as an investigator at the Northcoast Insurance firm owned by Chris Magruder (paunchy Dan Aykroyd of Dr. Detroit); indeed, Briggs has worked at Northcoast for twenty years. Surprisingly, too, he is no idiot and doesn't make a buffoon out of himself. As the film opens, Magruder has brought in a Miss Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt of the Trancers movies) to streamline his operation and increase efficiency. No sooner than Briggs and Fitzgerald meet do they take a strong dislike for each other that presumably masks their deeper feelings. Later, Voltan Polgar (David Ogden Stiers of TV's M.A.S.H.) hypnotizes Briggs and Fitzgerald at a night club in public and has them romantically reliant on each other until he snaps his fingers. Unbeknownst to them, however, sneaky Voltan never releases them from his spell and sends them off using certain key works to rob wealthy clients that their company has insured. Hypnotism and mesmerism go hand in hand as the gimmick at the heart of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, and we know from the get-go what is going to happen, so there is only a modicum of suspense. Everybody scrambles their brains to figure out how the thefts occurred and since Briggs is under Voltan's spell, he doesn't have a clue that he pinched the expensive jewelry. Sexy Charlize Theron is appropriately sultry as rich girl Laura Kensington who fails to seduce Briggs. The flavorful dialogue between Briggs and Fitzgerald as well as between Briggs and two private eyes is the best thing about this tame but entertaining comedy. We never learn exactly how Voltan knew how to exploit both Briggs and Fitzgerald for his larcenous scheme. Meanwhile, Magruder and Fitzgerald are having an affair on the side with the married Magruder stalling for time with Fitzgerald until he can get up the nerve to divorce his wife. This part of the plot anticipates the spin on the theme of adultery that Allen would use later more dramatically in his brilliant Match Point. Aside from the first-rate dialogue filled with barbs that Briggs and Fitzgerald feed each other, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion benefits from a surprising ending. Allen paced this comedy pleasantly enough, and the cast is top-notch, especially Wallace Shawn, John Schuck and Elizabeth Berkley of Showgirls. Altogether, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion qualifies as a breezy but forgettable Woody Allen epic. "},{"Title":"Severely Underrated","Date":"2 September 2007","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" Woody Allen's lovingly fashioned caper comedy is about grubby but vigilant insurance investigator C.W. Briggs and his arch-rival ballbusting female overseer Betty Ann Fitzgerald, whose bitter opposition is given new edge when they both are manipulated by a diabolical magician. A series of high-profile thefts create a major stir at the insurance office. Having no memory of what occurs under trance, Briggs is indeed the thief whose crimes he is determined to uncover.The problem of trust does not evade Allen in his romantic response to the classic film noir, nor does the quandary of personal interest in a crime. The opening of the film contrasts insurance investigators with cops by having one character say the cops want to catch the thief just like they do, but the cops don't have to cough up thousands of dollars in compensation. There is an assurance of diligence in an insurance agent like C.W. Briggs, and they get paid for it, but why should they be allegiant to their head honcho when a more attractive chance appears, if their sole regard is a paycheck? A paycheck they earn by revealing all sorts of enticing plots. They know all the mistakes not to make.Briggs is always bragging about how he catches crooks by putting himself in their position and thinking like them, having no clue how this boasting will soon implicitly serve to incriminate him. He is drawing attention to the issue of the consistency between the private detective and the criminal rival, and does not hesitate to rummage through the desk as well as break into the apartment of a colleague he finds suspicious. Of course, he is not much of a menace to the law because, in typical Woody Allen fashion, he blunders it all. And yet, under hypnosis, is capable of high society jewel theft.That is the power of the Jade Scorpion, under the spell of which Briggs and Fitzgerald, so vinegary and acerbic, are vulnerable to dreams and submit to do the sinister magician's bidding. Whenever Voltan signals Briggs or Fitzgerald back into trance to manipulate their crimes, they also recall their love, which Voltan first influenced them to concede under hypnosis. However their admissions go further than what Voltan initially instigated. Buried in the subconscious that is only accessible when under trance, they are cognizant of and recognize why they have such difficulty exhibiting love.Woody's nostalgic blend of comic thriller and opposites-attract brand of love story implies the impact of magic or art, to bring what is not yet understood to satisfaction. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is another one of those Woody Allen outings that could've been a little too light on its feet. Judging by its rate of critical and commercial success, I believe that others must've thought that it in fact was. However, I think that it turned out to be quite memorable and elatedly fun and suspenseful because of the very intelligently written, beautifully acted and incredibly riveting relationship between Woody Allen's insurance investigator and Helen Hunt's quality control woman. The two characters appear very clearly to hate each other, her being a highly self-confident insurance company headbreaker whose feelings are always kept in her breast pocket and him being a short little twerp who flaunts his successful investigations into false insurance claims. He's a womanizer who can't stand her success and she's bigger, badder and smarter and knows he can't. The dynamics that ensue in their relationship throughout the picture are great fun. Allen doesn't play the same warily unconfident, neurotic Jewish stereotype, yet he plays his character's reaches for toughness and cockiness for very subtle, self-deprecating laughs.Allen has always known how to create a very snug and enjoyable but very realistic atmosphere. This film is set in the urban 1940s avenue of The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, and Double Indemnity, of course taking place in New York, and giving calmly vivid life to every office, mansion, and apartment. The wallpaper is something one just knows is nonexistent nowadays. The dishes, furnishings, and nightstands are beautiful relics of coziness. The same goes for the clothing, just the plain suits that the men wear and the acute depiction of the time when women were just beginning to wear pants. Dan Aykroyd's pipe-smoking and even his classical up-scale manor of speaking are reminiscent of every boss behind the desk in every old movie. The chummy nature of Allen and his friend at the office is loyal and affectionate in a way men simply are not in this time. Restaurants are full of smoke and volunteers-from-the-audience nightclub magic acts by men who dressed like Arabs or gypsies. It's a lovely work of production design.Allen is not and never will wind down. His direction is still subtle but acute, his writing is still brilliant, complete with its refusal to take the customary way out. Here, he does a neat little magic trick of his own. The sharp, collar-flipping noir dialogue is gracefully infused with his trademark cynical and comically paranoid dialogue which still bears remarkable one-liners like when someone tells him that there's a word for people who think everyone is conspiring against them, and he replies, Yeah, perceptive.

The complaint about Woody Allen around this time (and still is) was that he was too old to convincingly play the leading man opposite attractive ladies half his age. Much more self-conscious of his humor than most realize, Allen responds with more absurdity, pairing himself opposite girls way younger and more attractive than he's ever shared the screen with, as Helen Hunt, Charlize Theron and Saved by the Bell's Elizabeth Berkley costar. Allen plays a private eye in the 1930s era (fair warning for any history buffs not much effort is put into historic recreation) his love interest played by Hunt is a woman who wants to modernize the police department where he works, and get rid of him and his old-fashioned ways. This is an obvious parallel to Allen's aging, showing once more his willingness to poke fun at himself. The gimmick of the movie is that Allen and Hunt are hypnotized into falling in love with each other for the purpose of committing crimes for a drug overlord. This makes it especially difficult for Woody Allen to do his job and find the criminal, considering he is the criminal, and while it's an overly convenient gimmick to set two plots together, it leads to sets us up for some pretty good laughs, highlighted all the way through by some of Woody Allen's best one-liners.

Now he doesn't waste tryout material in print - he throws them at the screen, however half cooked or half cocked.I guess it is a tribute to Allen as a comedian that even these productions can please an audience. Although even his fiercest fans will admit he is now well past his best. *Spoiler Starts*This script is clearly under worked and runs out long before the credits come up. While I am not here to give lessons on beginning-middle-and-end, the film is strangely TV-like in going out on a long drawn out time-filling we-are-all-friends-again and the real-bad-guys-are-in-jail style whimper.*Spoiler Ends*Helen Hunt is a very good actress in that she can play a role very few American's can. The smart, feisty, efficient women of today that the Average Joe would still be able to date.

While this isn't really meant to be taken seriously, it needed a few more drafts.Allen used to sell himself as a sexual incompetent for laughs, now he sells himself as an ageing pervert for laughs; although he has pulled back from using four letter words this time around. His bedtime scene with Charlize Theron (later a Best Actress Oscar Winner for Monster!) has the only laugh-out-loud scene from the entire movie.I also don't like him going back in time much (circa 1935-39?) because it further exposes his cheapskate film making (no street scenes!). Although it allows one good gag about not knowing Hitler's name!

There are even fewer who get away with it. Woody Allen is one of the exceptions to this rule though. Over his career, Allen has produced so many films staring him that they could probably be renamed the Woody series (for example Woody In The Future instead of 1973's Sleeper). In this film, the same is again true with Allen's regular screen persona this time relocated to 1930's New York. Change the date and rarely the setting however, and any film written, directed and staring Allen is always going to be worth a few viewings.Playing Insurance Investigator CW Briggs, Allen chooses in this feature to spend 98 minutes arguing with Helen Hunt and solving a superb murder mystery. Hypnotised by the Jade Scorpion, Briggs will rob and steal by night before then trying to catch himself during the day.There's a lot of harsh criticism for Woody Allen nowadays. With people either complaining that he ruins his own films or is just too old to play the roles he picks, poor old Woody is forever condemned and chastised. Ultimately though, all Allen ever does is live the regular man's dream. To be a private eye in 1930's America, or to be a saviour of the future, or to play any of the other roles Allen has done, the majority are major male fantasies. Allen's characters are always designed around his own personality and his own ability to make us laugh, but primarily Allen's characters always seem to be obsessed with sex, and who can blame him? In The Curse of the Jade Scorpion for example, Allen gives himself a character who most women tend to adore and who gets to kiss Helen Hunt and Charlize Theron. Theron in particular as Laura Kensington is drop dead gorgeous in this film, and the only major surprise is that Allen's character (although forced) rejects her and never gets to sleep with her. Allen basically gets the best characters, the best jobs and the best women, and when a man has all three of those things, truthfully, why should he really care if one or two people think he is too old for the part?The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is just another Woody vehicle really. The script is again Allen based and funny, the plot is detailed and well thought out, the acting is top notch by everyone (even the usually abysmal Elizabeth Berkley) and over all the film is hard to fault.On a side note, one thing which ALWAYS pleases about Woody Allen is the fact that he sticks to the same style of introduction. Since the turn of the millennium, a large amount of film conversation seems to have been devoted to the idea that an introduction should grab the audiences attention and make us expect something wonderful. For a lot of films, this is definitely true. With Allen however, the regular black screen with white writing is never flash and it never really grabs the attention (except perhaps noticing the familiar, unexpected name in the cast) yet it works. Ever since his earlier works, Allen has kept this style, and by keeping to it, there's a sense of familiarity and comfort. Change is good, but as Allen says in this film if something isn't broken, why fix it?So there it is. A lot of critics hate Allen for supposedly never repeating his earlier works. They compare his later films to Annie Hall (1977) and they feel undervalued. This always amazes however because whilst Allen has obviously gotten old (we all do), the guy still possesses the comic genius to make his films works. Whether on screen or just behind the camera, Allen is one of the greatest film contributors in the last forty years, and The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is another fine addition to his catalogue.

It is true that this isn't his best work (that would be Annie Hall), but The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is still a very nice movie. It lacks the depth that most of Woody's body of work has, but the void that is left by the lack of depth is filled by a great sense of fun; and that is a welcome replacement. As usual, Woody Allen stars, this time as C.W. Brigs, an insurance claims investigator. Woody Allen is his usual, neurotic self and his character makes a nice change from the sort of detective we are used to; i.e. strong, tough and dangerous. As it happens, this stereotype of an investigator comes out more in his opposite number; Helen Hunt. Hunt plays Betty-Ann Fitzgerald; a woman who has been brought in to streamline the company that Allen works for. Helen Hunt's character is one of those 'strong women', she herself says that she can do anything a man can do, and judging by her character; she probably can. Starring alongside these two are Dan Akroyd and Charlize Theron; in the roles of a fellow insurance man and a femme fatale respectively.The story is rather silly, and it follows Woody Allen and Helen Hunt, who are hypnotised into doing the bidding of a criminal mastermind. It is rather strange seeing Woody Allen in a film like this, mostly due to the fact that we're used to seeing him in more realistic films. Helen Hunt is a welcome addition to any film; she has a great persona, and she works well with Allen here. The two are very believable as a couple of people that hate each other, and that, coupled with Woody Allen's dialogue makes for a very nice partnership. Woody Allen has written better films than this one, but the dialogue here is worth a mention. Some of Woody's lines are priceless (you'd take your word over mine?), and a lot of the other dialogue had me in stitches. He has written funnier dialogue than this; but that's not to say that the dialogue here isn't hilarious. The support cast don't come off as well on the dialogue front as the two leads do, as Woody Allen has grossly underwritten them. His characterization isn't brilliant in this film, not even for the main characters; but as I said, this movie is clearly meant to be fun, and therefore it doesn't matter as much as it would if he had underwritten his characters in one of his more serious movies. From it's two fantastic leads, to it's hilarious dialogue; The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is a winner all the way. Don't watch it and think of how great some of Allen's other movies are, just look at it what it is; an entertaining crime caper with a neurotic central character. You won't be disappointed if you do.

He knows how to do that since he was the one who made sure other people could not do that. Of course it doesn't take long for CW to become the prime suspect. There is a funny side effect of the hypnotizing. When one of the two is hypnotized he or she loves the other and like I said they hate each other in normal life.This story that steals ideas combines that stolen ideas into a pretty entertaining, sometimes very funny movie. Charlize Theron plays a character that is not really needed in the movie but she steals every scene. Even Allen himself gets better in her scenes. The other women in this movie are good too. Hunt does a pretty nice job and Elizabeth Berkley, the girl from 'Showgirls', is the next best thing after Theron. She plays CW's secretary and that again is another character not really there for the story but for some funny Woody Allen comments. It didn't bother me much. Dan Aykroyd is the boss of the insurance company. He is a married man, close to a divorce, who has an affair with Betty Ann.The moments when or CW or Betty Ann is hypnotized are good and funny, as are the scenes involving the affair between her and the Aykroyd character.

I know many of the storylines in his films are highly exaggerated and somehow farcical, but they're obviously intended and shouldn't really be regarded as off-putting. It might not be the best Allen film, but he still knows what he is doing!It's simply better than any ordinary films out there!Unparalleled!!!

The in-and-out of hypnosis device may have worked 60 years ago; but today's audiences are more informed and refined to fully accept Allen's thin and silly story. What really works is the pairing of Helen Hunt and Allen as opposite characters both work in an insurance company, they strongly dislike each other and while attending a dinner with office folks they fall under the spell of an evil magician (David Ogden Stiers) who orders them to steal jewelry hidden in places where the company designed the security system. How they fall in love is the only mystery the viewers must solve, but it's preferable when they are fighting each other.

Hollywood Ending (2002) and Anything Else (2003) haven't managed to get released here yet, either in cinemas or on DVD. And The Curse of the Jade Scorpion played only briefly on the big screen - and sank like a stone.Yet watching it again, a couple of years later, I can't see what the problem is, really. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is an enjoyable, if light, comedy which delivers entertainment value to rival most successful contemporary releases.It's New York, 1940 seasoned insurance investigator C. W. Briggs (Allen) is irritated by the arrival of new employee Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), brought in to streamline the company. She sees Briggs as archaic; he sees her as interfering. One evening, an office trip to a local club results in Briggs and Miss Fitzgerald being taken on stage by a hypnotist (David Ogden Stiers) and made to declare their love for each other, much to the amusement of their colleagues. Once out of the trance, neither Briggs nor Betty Ann remembers a thing. But when Briggs becomes the prime suspect in a series of jewel robberies, he finds he needs Betty Ann's help, and together they set about uncovering the mystery of the Jade Scorpion...The Curse of the Jade Scorpion has beautiful period design, and Zhao Fei's gold-tinged cinematography suggests a black and white studio production of the forties, with prominent, classical framing, expressive use of shadow, and an economical use of establishment shots. And there's a group of appealing in-period performances Allen and Hunt spar verbally to amusing effect; Stiers sends a shiver down the spine with the words 'Constantinople' and 'Madagascar'; Dan Aykroyd plays the hapless boss; Brian Markinson, as Al, gives a nice account of what it might be like to have to work with Woody Allen in an office; and Charlize Theron, as a sultry heiress, is memorable with long blonde hair and man-eater self-assurance.Perhaps there's a feeling at the moment that Allen's filmmaking output has become habitual, that he's working a little bit on autopilot. If so, show me another director who, on autopilot, can use long takes so gracefully that their boldness only hits us later, who can retain such a sense of pace (Alisa Lepselter's editing is very nimble, and has a nice use of dissolves), and who can spin such an engaging feature-length yarn from the resolutely short-story idea of a hypnotist's act. If some of his most recent offerings feel like they could have done with a couple more rewrites - Small Time Crooks, say, and definitely Anything Else - then Jade Scorpion, while not top-level Allen, is a very agreeable movie.

If he does continue to play this role, he should at least get women who can act like they are attracted to him regardless, but Helen Hunt didn't seem up to the job. Sorry, but some actors can continue playing the leading man into their seventies, but unfortunately for Woody - he just doesn't have the genes to do it.Helen Hunt. I am a big fan, but she didn't look the least bit attracted to Woody - there was ZERO chemistry between them - and worst of all they just didn't banter well together. The one thing about all the successful Woody female costars is that they could deliver the Woody banter, so much so you could see how these two people could love each other. Well, I don't know what the problem was here, but Helen just didn't deliver the Woody dialog well. She is obviously a good actress, she definitely delivered in As Good as it Gets, even though there was an age gap there between her and Jack Nicholson, you could see them together - but she was just not convincing in Jade Scorpion.I think Woody should write himself more plausible characters to play, or perhaps just direct plausible actors in his brilliantly conceived films. After all, Jade Scorpion was well written and shot - I thought the plot was very entertaining. I just think he should have recast the two leads, his part and Helen Hunt's.

Curse of the Jade Scorpion was incredibly polite in inviting me in for a sweetly-wrapped 90-minute detective story, but it was dulled a little by overexposure to Allen's now stock nervous, bumbling character.  Following a jewel heist whodunit plot, Allen is as always delightful as a nerdy, diminuitive gumshoe caught in the middle when a hypnotist plays foul.  The answer to the whodunit? is made very clear from the beginning on, leaving no surprises, but the wind up and resolution of the movie are entertaining and complete;  I didn't feel at all pushed by the story or trying to make ends meet.  Allen did all the work for me.  Helen Hunt is fantastic as the Femi-Nazi Fitzgerald, establishing herself as a definite counter to every move C.W. Briggs (Allen) makes, yet just roughly submissive enough to make a romantic connection with another character.  The supporting cast were all superb; Dan Akroyd's character was a bit underacted, to the point where I thought his was a cold staging.  The thing that didn't strike me until the end of the film was Allen's obvious egocentric approach to the film.  A few times I felt the camera was pointed at him to advance a scene when another character was doing that just fine.  The ending of course is overtly Allencentric;  perhaps a more manly, Eliot Ness-like detective would suffice for the story with Allen as the unlikely victor taking over at the end.  Allen's jokes are always charming and funny, but overall at the end of the film I felt the entire picture was one long string of one-liners, mostly from Allen.  The moments between Allen and Hunt were gems, however.  Curse of the Jade Scorpion is one of those Allen pictures that is a complete story; a fable that is simply put together then simply deconstructed (no pun intended).  I enjoyed the film and I think others both familiar and not familiar with Woody's work would enjoy it immensely for its face value.  If anything, see it for the '40s-style wisecracks and the dash of film noir I felt in Charleze Theron's character.

I remember him from the later 'MASH' episodes, but in this he not only transforms Woody Allen and Helen Hunt into jewel thieves, but he managed to temporarily rid me of my dark mood. As soon as I read the poor reviews, but then saw how highly the viewing public rated this film, I knew it had to be. Critics continually compare each new Woody Allen film with the likes of his greatest - 'Manhattan' - and whilst they are right ('Manhattan' remaining an absolute classic) it does not mean Woody has lost his touch for comedy. There are more one-liners here than in a quarter of the total Marx Brothers movies ever made. Not all as funny, granted, but they're still there. Even Helen Hunt, who shines as a comedienne here, gets her fair share of laughs. For once, Woody does not play a neurotic, and it's quite odd to see him so old and relatively decrepit; and yet apparently mentally sound. His age actually makes the movie funnier, and doesn't make him look silly, as many critics viewed. After all, he's constantly making jokes at his own expense, and if you can still do that, then you're never too old. Even his liaison with an alluringly blonde Charlize Theron, whose attraction doubles in this wig, is not particularly far-fetched, when she explains why she is turned on by his hovel of an apartment. Perhaps Woody is getting old, though, because he wrote the script, and he could have got himself hypnotised after bedding her; not just before he was about to jump in the sack! (No spoilers here, which is why it may be confusing to anyone who has not seen the film). A very likeable movie, with a good cast, which is half the battle with any slight plot. Recommended for fans of the one-liner. There are some real gems here, especially in the exchanges between Woody and the delightful Helen Hunt.

But we mustn't judge this film against his groundbreaking predecessors such as Annie Hall, Husbands and Wives and Hannah and Her Sisters,  because it is obvious Curse isn't meant to be that kind of movie. But rather, let us measure this film against all films in general. Jade Scorpion is just plain fun! It gives us neurosis is big doses, it gives us big stars, and it gives us big laughs. What more can we really ask for?Woody Allen plays C.W. Briggs, a top-notch detective at an insurance agency, set is 1940 Manhattan. Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) is called in to make the insurance agency more efficient and right away, the two just don't click. We have the privilege to hear some of the best insults and one line zingers going back and forth ever! Betty Ann and C.W. are hypnotized at a party. While they are under trance, they reveil their secret love, not lothing for each other. When C.W. hears the word `Constantinople' he goes into trance, and when Betty Ann hears the word `Madagascar' she goes into trance. The hypnotist (David Ogden Stiers) later uses these words to have Betty Ann and C.W. do his criminal biddings. This plot offers us a bunch of comical plot twists, and while some are predictable, it in no way effects the comedic value of the film.Woody has always had a way in picking the perfect actors. This holds true in The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Helen Hunt is perfect as the outwardly cold efficiency expert and Woody Allen's bickering partner. Hunt and Allen seem to click much better than his recent pairings Tracy Ullman and Tea Leoni. Charlize Theron is convincing as wild girl Laura Kensington who has a weird infatuation with C.W. And making his Woody Allen film debut, Dan Aykroyd is the perfect choice to play the classic 40's boss, Mr. McGruder.This is Woody's funniest film since 1993's Manhattan Murder Mystery. If you are looking to leave the theatre with a great big smile. Drop everything, and run to go see The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Forget jade, this film is pure gold!

The influences I detected included films of Billy Wilder--Double Indemnity, since it dealt with insurance investigation, and The Apartment, reflected in a romance between two characters at the insurance office.  Charlize Theron's character could have stepped straight out of The Big Sleep; indeed, she's the only one who acts she's in a 1940's film.The most notable influence, in my opinion, was Bob Hope.  Woody Allen has always claimed Hope as an influence on his comic persona, but since Hope has a reputation as a straightforward comedian while Allen's comedy is so twistedly ironic, few people have taken Allen at his word.  However, Hope in many ways can be considered the first comedian with a neurotic persona, and so many people followed in his footsteps that it's hard to appreciate his innovations today.  It's not too hard to imagine The Curse of the Jade Scorpion as a Bob Hope film; one might even imagine it as something written for Hope back in 1940, then shelved and lost until today.Besides detecting influences, the chief pleasure in the film comes from watching the actors at work, especially Allen and leading lady Helen Hunt.  The plot is interesting but not especially compelling, the visuals mostly functional, and while the dialogue is OK it's not up with the best of Allen's work.  The actual delivery of the dialogue, however...that's different.Allen, as a veteran insurance investigator who gets by on gut instinct, and Hunt, a newly hired efficiency expert whose operations threaten Allen's job (and whose intelligence and assertiveness threaten Allen personally), squabble throughout most of the film, and the only screwball aspect of it is that we know they're fated to be together by the end.  Allen's role is a variation on his usual film persona, but within that persona he manages to convince us that he is a competent, though sometimes sleazy, investigator, and none of his actions and little of his dialogue are out of place for 1940.  Hunt, on the other hand, seems more of a creature of the last twenty years or so; if time travel existed, one might think she'd emigrated from the present day to 1940.  Since few movies set in the past fail to say something about the present in which they are made, this is excusable; indeed, some of Hunt's actions as an efficiency expert (such as organizing the files and pondering the wisdom of maintaining an in-house investigative department; both of these horrify Allen, naturally) could be considered the wave of the future, just as (in hindsight) this bright, unashamedly assertive female executive herself is.It would be nice to think that there are purposeful deeper meanings in Curse of the Jade Scorpion, since Allen's best earlier films worked equally well as comedy and introspection.  While I could speculate on what its plot implies about Allen's psyche, I'd rather take this film as it was obviously intended, as unabashed light entertainment.  It may be that Allen doesn't care anymore to reach deep within himself for material to move audiences, and to the extent that we remember the impact of such films as Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Crimes and Misdemeanors, The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is unavoidably disappointing.  This has not been a great year for films, however, so it still stands head and shoulders over most of the rest of what's out there now.

But the notion of Woody Allen as a weasely, womanizing gumshoe in an office full of Babbitty insurance agents--balding, pot-bellied old schnooks not too far from himself---has tantalizing possibilities, even when his opposite number is a stiff efficiency expert played by Helen Hunt.  There may be no more wholly external and artificial actress in American movies now than Hunt. Here, as a smart cookie who's aalways undone by her lunge for the wrong guy, you see a funny-poignant role that would have been brilliantly essayed by Judy Davis; clearly, for box-office reasons, Hunt's in her place.

The readers have no time. Just tell them simply what was good and what wasn't. And in one word after.. Did you love it or not?. Of course at the time I've seen that his very opinion was the real thing to not love ! But as the time goes bye I learned carefully that it's the law of journalism after all. So based on the above, here is my review  I loved  the fact that (Woody Allen) struggles to make his own movies by his own way, not to be a Hollywood bitch (sorry !). How his surviving movies are always grounded on one brilliant idea, so talented dialogue with catchy phrases, and some vision to some issues. I loved all the stars being in his movies doing whatever just to be in a (Woody Allen) film. His love and sincerity for the old American cinema or music. His cleverness when it comes to be sarcastic about the American culture, policy, and society. His wonderful studying for the character of the middle class intellectual man. And above all his wonderful ability to create continuously and his unwavering will of making movies whatever what.I hated  his invariability as an actor; whereas the man directs himself all along for years and years (That's bad if you ask me !) so his performance became quite tasteless as he aged. He repeats all of his signature moves again and again in a very boring way and in a very fake performance with all the theatrical hands' moves and else. For sure the persona can make wonders. But here it became timeworn wearisome and out of shape wonders. Not to mention his insistence to be the most wanted man ever in his movies' drama; where all the women fall for him and his unique sexuality from the first sight even when he is in his sixties ! Actually it became absolutely unbearable especially this time because the role isn't for him at all. Yes, he is fulfilling his old dream of (Play It Again Sam) to be (Humphrey Bogart) but (Bogart) wasn't 66 year old when he played the immortal slick detective at the 1940s (Plus he was Bogart !). I know, (Allen) just uses the peculiarity of the classic persona and salutes it in a way too. But sorry. Here it was weak, out of convincing and silly ! I hated the old music records on the soundtrack. The tracks were nice sometimes but for most of the time looked funny, precisely using those very old rusty discs. Maybe he didn't try to arrange it or even replay it to not harm the zero budget. But that was annoying and distracting all the way (noticing that I'm basically a big fan of the ancient jazz and swing music). Then that lazy directing, I thought that it was all sluggish regarding the crazy flavor of the story. The cinematography was deadly not creative at all. The sound effects were so aged (with a bit exaggeration as the hypnosis' scene at the nightclub). I hated that a great idea was mistreated directionally like this, I hated that almost all of the previous problems were also in the last movies of (Allen), and I hated to not wait much of his work lately except for new &#x96; nearly destroyed &#x96; good idea ! And like my old nagger mentor taught me  That was not good, I was about to quit watching more than once, and I'm sad to say that too !

I adored most of his films and I have seen Annie Hall countless times. Because of this, I was terribly disappointed by his latest venture Curse of the Jade Scorpion. Not only was this bad for a Woody Allen movie, this was bad for any movie. Uncharacteristic of Allen's usually witty film dialogue, this film had an unusually dull script. Basically, it consisted of lines that seemed as though they tried to hard to be funny. By the end of the film, I grew horribly bored of Allen and Helen Hunt constantly bantering back and forth with unfunny lines such as, You're a near-sighted cockroach among others. What happened to the simple Thank Jew? Honestly, I laughed a mere three times during the film his usual opening credits against a jazz backdrop, Allen taking a mug shot and when I dropped popcorn down my shirt.Most of the performances were below average as well. Allen seemed to be acting as though he was doing a parody of his usual persona over-exaggerated stuttering and his thinking that he is actually a babe-magnet (that will take care of the next paragraph). Hunt was especially dull... that's basically all I could say about her. However, I was actually surprised with Charlize Theron's performance; her's was the best in the movie.Lastly, I hate to say this after being on of his devotees for a few years now, but Woody Allen seems to think that he can still pass as a leading man... he barely could when he was thirty years younger, but it was funny then. He kissed Theron, I believe, twice in the film... is he aware that he is about forty years older than she (and costar Elizabeth Berkeley) are? Hunt is almost thirty years younger than him. If you think about it, even Diane Keaton, his earliest leading lady, was ten years too young. Not only did the women in this movie fall in love with him, they *threw* themselves at him. Allen seems to have the biggest ego in Hollywood... he let Soon Yi go to his head. Don't bother seeing this movie if you don't want to be bored out of your mind. Preserve Allen's dignity and rent one of his classics such as Annie Hall or Hannah and Her Sisters. Try to remember him the way he was a comedy genius.

It's nothing of the sort!","Date":"15 January 2013","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" Woody Allen's The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is set in 1940 and combines and pays homage to two film genres popular during the forties, screwball comedy and film noir, even though during that decade those two genres were not generally regarded as having much in common with one another. It shares with film noir the figure of the dedicated, trenchcoat-wearing lone criminal investigator and with screwball comedy not only an absurd and convoluted plot but also the device of two characters who, on the surface, hate (or at least dislike) one another but who are secretly in love. In the forties those characters were often a divorced or separated couple who inevitably ended by getting back together, like Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday.Here the ill-matched couple are C.W. Briggs, an insurance investigator, and Betty Ann Fitzgerald, an efficiency expert working for the same company. Although Briggs has had a good deal of success in uncovering insurance frauds and recovering stolen goods, due mainly to his ability to think like a criminal and his numerous underworld connections, he does not impress Betty Ann who regards his methods as outdated and Briggs himself as a male chauvinist pig (to use a more modern expression not actually in use in the forties). Unfortunately for Briggs, Betty Ann has the ear of his boss, Chris Magruder, with whom she is secretly having an affair. The plot is not only far-fetched but also fairly complex, but the central idea is that Briggs and Betty Ann are hypnotised by a crooked stage magician into stealing jewels, that neither of them have any memory of what they have done under hypnosis, and that Briggs is then assigned by Magruder to investigate these crimes. The film had a production budget of $26 million, making it Allen's most expensive film to date, even though that figure is peanuts compared to today's average Hollywood blockbusters, or even to the Hollywood blockbusters of 2001. It fared poorly at the box office and received a mixed reception from the critics. For at least the last twenty years the standard critical id√©e recue about Woody Allen has been to say He's not as funny as he used to be, but in the case of The Curse of the Jade Scorpion critics of this type have had an unexpected ally, Woody himself, who has said that it is perhaps his worst movie. He stated that it was only the high cost of the film, caused largely by its period setting and its elaborate sets, which prevented him from going back and reshooting the whole thing from scratch as he famously (or notoriously) did with September. My initial reaction was to say that this is yet more evidence that great artists are not always great critics, especially where their own work is concerned. Yet in one respect I think that Allen was right. His main concern was that he had been wrong to cast himself as Briggs, and, in all honesty, I am compelled to agree with him on this point. To start with, it was a mistake to make Briggs so much older than Betty Ann. (Allen is 28 years older than his leading lady Helen Hunt). Addressed to a man of her own age, Betty Ann's sharp put-downs would be pertinent and to the point; addressed to a man old enough to be her father they seem arrogant, impertinent and evidence of a lack of respect. More importantly, Briggs is totally different from the sort of neurotic, angst-ridden intellectual whom we have come to regard as the typical Woody Allen character. This is a role- a cynical, wisecracking private eye, irresistible to women even if they dislike what he stands for- which seems to demand a cross between Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant, and I don't think Woody really fits that particular bill. And yet, despite this miscasting, I cannot agree with Woody that this is his worst movie. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion may lack the depth and significance of his truly great films like Crimes and Misdemeanors, Annie Hall or Manhattan, but it has a genuinely witty script, based around the brilliant comic idea of a detective investigating a series of crimes which, unknown to him, he has committed himself. Allen himself may be miscast, but this cannot be said of the rest of the cast, especially Hunt who makes the most of her splendidly bitchy part, the sort of roles which in the thirties or forties would have been played by Russell or Katharine Hepburn. All the great films noirs, and most of the great original screwball comedies (Nothing Sacred being a rare exception), were shot in black- and-white. No doubt Allen considered doing the same with this film, as he had done with Manhattan, but in the end made it in colour, but in colours which Roger Ebert described as burnished and aged, with a palette dominated (as in some of his other films, such as Alice) by browns, yellows and oranges. This palette combines with the elaborate period sets to give this film a highly distinctive look, one which recalls the films of the forties without actually copying them. Charlize Theron appears in a role which adds little to the plot but which adds greatly to the mood by recalling the femmes fatales of noir; if Hunt is the new Russell or Hepburn, Theron takes on the role of the new Lizabeth Scott or Gloria Grahame. Is this really your worst movie, Woody? In my view it's nothing of the sort- in fact, it's a positively good one!. You will have to try very hard if you want to come up with something as awful as September. Even in its reshot version that must count as your worst movie. 7/10 "},{"Title":"The dialog was all wrong","Date":"2 October 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime, Mystery","Review":" The reason the movie went awry was that only Charlize said any of the 1940s lingo such as gumshoe; that kept a movie like this flowing.

Not terribly funny and certainly not believeable enough to be taken seriously, the film exists somewhere in-between drama and comedy and suffers from Allen's presence in front of the camera. It's no secret that he's never been leading man material, at least not from the standpoint of screen presence. But in his past films, in the 70s and 80s, he was younger, fresher and funnier, which enabled him to pull it off. Now, he is much older and continues to play the neurotic, stone-faced buffoon, a caricature we know far too well, who is miraculously still the object of desire for the likes of attractive, much younger leading ladies like Charlize Theron and Helen Hunt. Both actresses turn in decent performances, given their two-dimensional roles. However, it's totally incredible and almost insulting that Allen seems to think we'd believe such women would go for a schmoe like him --- even in a comedy. Like many of us, I used to laugh to the point of tears at a Woody Allen film, but his material has become just too drab and recycled to elicit anything more than an occasional chuckle at best. Though production values are good, even his titles and scoring are beginning to look and sound like the rest of his films. To be honest, I'd like to think Allen hasn't completely dried up. I think he just needs to take more chances, make a concerted effort not to repeat the same techniques and permanently step away from the camera lens. Perhaps if he would just concentrate on directing and entrust others to do the performing, he would realize and regain his vision.

It is a plot we've seen before so many times, in so many other better movies. We are supposed to believe a love interest in a 60-something Woody Allen and a 30-something Helen Hunt ??? Such a waste of Charlize Theron. Try almost any other Allen movie.  If you want something in the same genre, Manhattan Murder Mystery is a far netter movie.

You looked haggard in this film and the plotline was lame and uninspired.  I must say Helen Hunt looked great though! I have seen nearly all of your films and count myself a fan but this movie was just sad without any real laughs or anything interesting to say.  I met a polish mother and son prior to the screening as they sat in front of me.  They were more entertaining than your film.

When will I learn? Except for a brief pause with 'Small Time Crooks' Woody has forgotten how to make a funny movie.  Yes, I saw Stardust Memories. I don't care if he wants to make serious movies, fine.  But here he is attempting to make a funny movie and failing miserably. This movie was so lame and the lead performances wooden.  Rent anything before Manhattan Murder Mystery and enjoy.

What I found was an outline of brilliance with no meat.  Kind of like eating Belgian chocolate with a K-mart center.  Woody should get some help or just hang it up.  What a waste of great acting talent.  You can see everyone wants to work with him.  Maybe they should help more with the script and dialog.

Sometimes I'm not the only one. This was one of those times. I can't say enough bad things about it, partly because I can't remember much, partly because no one will believe me. I've seen I think every one of Woody's films and only hated one other - (about 4 films ago?)  but not this much. Woody looks sickly, pathetic, weak, tired. The story is so stupid it's an embarrassment - and it has no intrinsic interest whatever, no panache, no surprise. The jokes are weak and predictable. The acting, directing, lighting, set design, and dialogue are deliberately overdone to simulate 40's gumshoe movies - which Woody has done before and infinitely better. What a tired, compulsive, sad movie by a man who can't seem to do anything else but go through the motions even when his brain is empty. Even Woody Allen needs to get a life, and its absence shows. It shouldn't have been made, funded, produced or distributed. No wonder his old producer abandoned him. He may be finished - still, he did enough to become an immortal.  Apparently he has given up on ever making a honest movie again. Don't cry for Woody. Pray for him.

This one was the worst. This is the first movie that I have seen this year that I felt worse about wasting my time than wasting my money. Woody Allen was pathetic. This was the most depressing aspect since he has been so good in the past. He should have retired from acting or found new characters to play as Clint Eastwood did. All of the actors seemed uncomfortable and strained. This movie felt like a high school play with the actors struggling with their roles.It seems to want to be a comedy but I heard only a few (very few) titters in the rather small crowd. It could have been funny but having a guy who looks 70 acting like he's still the bantering flirtatious twenty something character that Allen has played so many times doesn't work. Find something better to do-Woody Allen should have.

The sets look good and the film has an attractive sepia tone to it. Unfortunately, whenever there are two characters in a scene, they look as though each has performed their lines separately and then the scene has been edited to make them appear together. I know this is conventional Hollywood practice but it surprises me that Woody Allen does it. In films such as Husbands and Wives and Celebrity Allen has pointedly made the audience aware of the fact that all the actors are in the studio at the same time. Being charitable, maybe he has deliberately edited the film to give it a Hollywood look.The main problem, however, is that Helen Hunt is no Katharine Hepburn and Woody Allen is no Spencer Tracey. The dialogue does not sizzle and most of the humour falls flat. I enjoy seeing Allen in his own films and I have been more tolerant than most of his predilection for playing opposite attractive young actresses. However I have to admit to a certain feeling of distaste at Allen's sexual sparring in this film, not only with Hunt but also with Elizabeth Berkley and Charlize Theron. He just looks too old, not just for the sexual shenanigans but also for his supposed job of ace insurance investigator. He reminded me at times of Jack Warner in the British television series Dixon of Dock Green, who went on playing a policeman until he was well into his eighties.John Cusack and Kenneth Branagh made an excellent job of impersonating a younger Allen in Bullets over Broadway and Celebrity. Either Allen should write parts for himself as a 67 year old or he should stick to supporting roles in future.

Don't expect a great blockbuster, it's just a comedy. Good actors but the same old neurotic Allen, that is getting kinda pathetic being himself all the time. He's done great movies, but he is definitely NOT an actor. He just plays himself, and that's a little boring. The worst thing  Helen Hunt's performance. Probably not her fault, since she's done greater jobs before. You can absolutely tell (without even knowing) she is directed by Woody Allen. He turned her into a caricature of himself. And the end is totally fiction ! Just his dreams come true in the screen.

AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL should include Allen as one of the torturers living in the United States bases solely on this movie.Mia Farrow might not have been the best lover or partner, but she would NEVER have allowed him to put out films like this.

Curse of the Jade Scorpion is a fine example. Story good. Script a little arkward, but good. Acting pretty hammy for the most part, except Allen. Allen comes off as little more than a geriatric doing his best to remember what day it is.I'm usually a big fan of any detective/private eye type movie, but this was painful. I had to go home and watch LA Confidential again just to restore my faith in the genre.As for comedy; If you're into sparse and absurdly arkward one-liners this may be for you. Otherwise, steer clear.Definately one for hardcore Allen fans only.

Woody Allen is a perverted old man . I mean come on , he cant act and always plays this loser type guy who lands beautiful women who in real life wouldnt let him lick their shoes.This is another movie about Woody Allen and nothing new. All of Woody Allens movies that he appears in are the same loser and feel sorry for him movies ..Stick to being behind the camera Woody andmaybe more people will pay to see your movies .. And grow up, your a perverted old man with fantasies. Marrying your step daughter is pretty disgusting and having beautiful women chasing you in movies is so unbelievable.  "}]
