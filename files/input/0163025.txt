In fact, it was a lot more enjoyable than the stupid second JP. Did it equal the first? No, of course not. The original story was easily the best of the three, but I found this an enjoyable movie and far better than what I had been led to believe.The filmmakers were smart in making this a short film. People had seen plenty of the dinosaurs by now so let's no overdo it...and they didn't with an film just under an hour-and-a-half (not including the final credits.).That made this short-and-sweet. We saw some new reptiles, had a few scares, enjoyed the beautiful jungle scenery (filmed in Hawaii) and - bang - it's over. The characters were fine, nobody totally annoying as in the second film. The lulls featured a family getting back together and finding their missing teen. Nothing wrong with that.A good story unfairly maligned and nice, short evening of entertainment.

She is desperate to see it having seen JP and the Lost world and generally loving dinosaurs. I am a great movie fan so have my own opinions on the film but first I'll address the suitability of this movie for young viewers. The original film and Lost World are true 'family movies' containing elements for everyone - decent story, good acting, great (groundbreaking) effects and humour etc. There's nothing wrong with kids being scared periodically, being scared is part of the whole monster movie experience. All that said, JP3 is too 'full on' for one as young as 6 and I think I'll try to get her to wait for DVD, to tone down the whole experience. She saw the first two at home and wont be expecting the sheer sound and visuals of this movie at the cinema. I would advise other parents the same, at least with kids this young.As for my opinion of the film - well, we've seen it all before. I've read many comments and agree with most. Its lame storyline is its down fall and this could've been so much better. In my opinion a far better film would have carried a 15 certificate at least. One they could have made for adults only, and really explored new territory and therefore could not be compared to the previous two. A huge audience loves scary films and monster movies so why not go for it with a proper modern day horror. Throw in a good conspiracy theory plot about INGEN and some realistic profanity and gut wrenching effects. In short give people what they really want. JP3 does niether for either age group.For your children, I reccommend the BBC's series 'Walking with Dinosaurs' it's informative and has near the same quality of effects.See for yourself.

The bad rip offs of much better movies and the extremely corny, sentimental dialogs only written to please slow adults and small children. This movie was so bad in fact that you don't need Mike and the Bots from MST3K to make fun of it, the movie writes it's own punch lines for you to say. Any movie with Matthew Broderick as an action hero should be an indication on how bad it is, and with a monster that looks more like a raptor than the Godzilla who all know and love, the recipe for failure is pretty big.Which brings us to this film which is not only one of the worse sequels ever made but probably one of the worse films made period. Sam Neil is a great actor, but the film itself is so bad that it makes him look like a buffoon. The way they tried to make him into an Indiana Jones wannabe is not only sad but also flat out laughable. He comes more a cross more like Chevy Chase than Harrison Ford.  The casts of supporting characters fares no better and in some respect fare much worse. William H Macy is probably one of the best actors around but you really can't tell that by his performance here which is beyond annoying.  Tea Leoni is flat out annoying as well as his wife, a woman whose scream could chip years old paint. I think the only actor who fares decent here is the late Michael Jeter, who is barely in the film at all. His performance is funny, and could have benefited the film a lot more if he was in it more.The special effects are not as impressive as they were in the last two films, and the direction is very disjointed compared to what Spielberg was able to do with the first two movies.  Spielberg was able to create tension and create action scenes that can blow your socks off. Joe Johnson, who steps in for Mr. Spielberg this time around not only abandons what his predecessor had done before but completely disregards any logic that the other movies had. The first two films where about science and the dangers of tampering with nature. This film is just a strait forward monster movie that does not even have a plot to go by. The characters here are nothing more than Dinosaur food and the setting itself does not even look like the island of the last movie. There are even certain things in this film that even contradicts some of the information that was giving in the last two films, and it tries to bring in a dinosaur that was not even created in those movies.Its really sad to see Joe Johnson demean himself with a bad film like this, because he has done much better work in the past.  The Rocketter is a prime example of a good comic book movie, and October Sky is a well-paced family drama that should have had more notice in the theater. With this movie, Joe looks like he just wanted to cash a pay check, and judging by the way every thing in the film was done, it looks like every one involved were doing the same thing. Which is sad in a sense because it's the fans that pay for it in the long run.

That is, update the formula used in its prequels to create even more lifelike dinosaurs. Unfortunately, it didn't try to do much of anything else, leaving us with yet another big, dumb, summer action flick... hardly the caliber of the previous films.Basically, the story goes like this a rich kid is taken to Costa Rica by his parents to do some para-sailing... and, for some reason, he decides that an island famed for its man-eating dinosaurs would be the best place to do it. Surprise, surprise Something Goes Wrong, and the kid is stranded on the island. Who do his parents go to for help? Dr. Grant, the paleontologist who happened to get himself involved with dinosaurs before. Rather than telling him the truth upfront, they con him into coming by giving him a big fake check and swearing that they will not touch down on the island. Dr. Grant agrees hesitantly to this condition. But when they get to the island, they touch down anyway, making their plane a prime target for a dinosaur attack. Something Goes Wrong again, and this time, Grant and the kid's parents are stuck as well.The plot pretty much ends right there, and that's only the first thirty minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie involves people running from and/or getting eaten by dinosaurs. Like I said, it's a big, dumb, action flick. If you're looking for something that even remotely has an air of the old Michael Crichton magic, look to the first two films. Jurassic Park III is the beginning of what will become a reiteration of the Jaws fiasco... endless sequels until one of them sucks so bad, it finds its home in the infamous Bottom 100 list.

It was short when compared to the first two Jurassic Park movies; only 90 minutes long like most sex flicks. There was basically no plot, no character development, and no Jeff Goldblum. It really reminded me of a porno, because the characters would talk alittle bit, and then get chased by dinosaurs for a long extended period of time. Now, if you just replace the aspect of getting chased by dinosaurs with some hot guy/girl, girl/girl, guy/guy, guy/gerbil, or dino/dino sex action; then you basically have the same movie. This movie is terrible compared to the first JP, and bad when measured up to the sequel. Now JP2 was no masterpiece either, but I will take very cheesy T-Rex smashing through San Diego any day, before hearing that damn cell phone go off again. Am so glad that JP4 is currently titled The Extinction, because after this installment this franchise needs a nice big fat Hailey's comet to smash right into it leaving every dinosaur/character dead expect Jeff Goldblum. Goldblum is the man!!!! Anyway, you will get some entertainment value from the dinosaurs, but don't except much. Just turn off your brain, and enjoy a semi fun ride which includes getting chase by dinosaurs, getting chased by flying dinosaurs, getting chased by more dinosaurs, and yea thats about it. I should have probably have given this movie at least a five, for its effort; but the ending was so stupid and abrupt that I had to dock it a point. Its worth one viewing, and one viewing only.

It's also the first film in the series that is not based on a novel by Michael Crichton. That's basically JP3 in a nutshell. It's not necessarily a great movie, nor does it break any new grounds of adventure or take many risks, but it does take advantage of all the creative ideas. You will not hear anyone in the audience complain that the movie isn't inventive, because these writers, Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim Taylor, really have an imagination. 	The story takes place eight years after the incident at Jurassic Park. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) still works as a paleontologist on dinosaur dig sites in Montana with his young assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola). He's offered a good sum of money by a wealthy couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) who want Grant to guild them on a flight over Isla Sorna-also owned by the dinosaur cooperation. Sam agrees, but once over the island, something goes wrong and he's once again stuck on the dinosaur infested territory fighting for his life.   	Jurassic Park 3 is complied with stunning brevity. The dialogue is concise and doesn't wonder. The character's relationships are instantly obvious. It's very clear that this film is shorter, cheaper, and more simple than its predecessors. That is not such a bad thing. The second Jurassic Park was terrible-an all star cast placed in situation and situation where they run from big monstrous creatures. Although Jurassic Park 3 is more or less the same formula, it gets sassy and fresh. Eye-popping special effects involve everything from a bird-dinosaur attempting to feed a human to its babies to a massive battle between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a new breed of lizard called Spinosaurus. Some of these scenes do not really work. Amazingly, many succeed. I have various complaints about the movie. There are not enough violent encounters to keep the audiences interested throughout. Unlike the first two films, the dinos in JP3 only eat a handful of characters and they occur in the opening half hour. You can probably guess the characters who meet a graphic demise; anyone who is billed in the film's credits that you have heard of will probably live. I also think the movie needs more thrills. It seems as if the producers are more interested in proving to the audience that these dinosaurs are really smart rather than focusing on lean, clean terror.Regardless of the pictures many problems, during a summer movie season jam-packed with special effects extravaganzas that don't work (The Mummy Returns, Pearl Harbor, Planet of the Apes, The Fast and he Furious, and Swordfirsh to name a few) finally comes one that does. I recommend Jurassic Park 3 on the basis that you don't expect something remotely as fascinating as the original, but still hunger for a shallow 90 minute thrill ride.

Sam Neil, bless his heart, appeared so old, distracted, and tired in this movie. He was such a downer, I was rooting for some dinosaur to eat his bummer butt. William H. Macy is a champ. A brilliant actor, and by all accounts, a wonderful person as well. Tea Leoni is also a champ, and a treasure. And a babe. But despite their valiant efforts, even their glowing presence couldn't save this turkey. All of the supporting cast were completely inconsequential. As they died off, one could only wonder if their characters' deaths brought the movie any closer to ending. One good point, although not nearly enough to make this movie worth your time, is the quaint 1950's sci-fi vibe. Some of the linguistic talents and high intelligence ascribed to the monsters in this movie reminded me of Invasion of the Ant People, or some such. If I had been drunk, and sitting with a batch of drunken friends at a fraternity or dorm, we'd have been laughing and hooting our fannies off. As it was, I kept my yawns to myself, so as to not disturb the experience of the 5 and 6 year-olds in the audience. I have fond memories of the cheap, cheesey junk I saw at the local theater with my little brother and my friends when we were all very young. Great nostalgia for me as an adult. And I didn't want to wreck the moment for these kids now. After all-- they deserve childhood memories of bad crap too.

The aim I guess that the people behind the scenes were aiming for was a family movie with a bit of suspends and while there is a family movie to be had here, it also tries to be a Jurassic Park film and unfortunately it fails as both to a degree.It fails as a family movie cause the script is not strong enough to support the story. Despite the venom thrown at William H Macy and especially Tea Leoni, both are very appealing actors and they do work hard to make it all work but the script just handicap their efforts to make it possible. It fails as a Jurassic Park film cause it lacks the tension, suspense and the story points that made the first two films in the series ( Jurassic Park And The Lost World) so well made and memorable. Not to mention the fact that they felt like fully formed movies with a beginning, middle and end. Jurassic Park 3 just feels like a Saturday morning serial. Not bad but nothing like the other films in the series. There is one scene in the film that almost manages to bring a little tension which is the bird cage scene but even that ends up flat compared to any of the scenes in the other films of the series. The other major problem is the fact that While Sam Neill works his ass off to make this film watchable, the script does the most disservice to the character of Alan Grant, whose happy ending from the original Jurassic Park was not only ruined thanks to this movie but has his character dumb down in order to fall for the dumb stuff that happens in this film. Despite all of this, Sam Neill is working overtime to make you care. Too bad the script did not.As I said before, it has a lot of heart thanks to it's actors but thanks to a bad script, Jurassic Park 3 is with out a doubt the weakest entry in the series.

Jurassic Park was perhaps a critical flop, but it's importance regarding the incredible C.G.I must never be forgotten. Orginanly the dinosaurs where going to be brought to life using animated models(like Wallace and Gromit) for example only a tad more realistic obviously and full size anamatronic models, used in the T-Rex close ups. But Spielberg wasn't satisfied with the quality of the animation, despite Phil Tippert using the motion blur to make the movement of the models less static and more fluid. Then Tippet suggesting trials with C.G.I which was used for the first time by I.L.M in 85 on Young Sherlock Holmes, the rest as they say is history. The results in my opinion are awesome I am a great fan of stop motion animation particularly Ray Harryhausens, But the the first time I saw the Tyrannosaur rip down the fence I could'not breath. I'm work in the industry now and it was that scene more perhaps than any other film that made me want to work in film. The T-Rex is the star of Jurassic Park, the ending is probably one of my favourites of any movie, With the Rex saving the day at the last minute, Ripping apart the annoying Raptors. The spinosaurs is a joke, it's not only a incredibly stupid idea to introduce a dinosaur that wasn't even mentioned in the first two films or the books on a island no larger than 8 miles long, I would have thought we would have noticed it useless it was a incredibly shy 12 tons killing machine. But its not only the fact the appearance of the Spinosaurs is laughable, but it also breaks wind in the face of all the amazing work that was done on the first film. For me the T-REX is an Icon of groundbreaking visual affects, in the same way the original King Kong was at the time and later 2001 and star wars could be considered as landmark films effects wise also. The Rex is the Star of Jurassic park and is still probably the most popular dinosaur ever just ask your kids what their favourite is! So killing it off in the first half hour of what was a terrible, terrible film for me is nothing less than proof that Hollywood is slowly losing it's soul. Ignoring what films should be about Artistic expression and intelligent entertainment and instead it seems from an Englishmans point of view that the Art of film making is being destroyed my big company's who's sole motivation is earning money. And the constant stream of insulting re-makes and lame brain sequels flying out of Hollywood only gives weight to my argument.

Even in the original movie such behavior strained credibility past the breaking point on a few occasions, such as having a dinosaur burst through solid walls as if it recognized what a wall is and anticipated what would be on the other side - was that a tyrannosaurus or Godzilla? How many wild animals has anyone ever seen demonstrate such behavior?

He and Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern, who blink and you'll miss her) have broken up for reasons unexplained. As an attempt to structure some kind of story, a couple meets up with Grant to ask for help in rescuing their son who apparently disappeared on the island and in return they promise a big reward. Now lets think about this for a minute. You've stumbled on to someone you've never met before in your life and you have no idea of their finances. Since Grant agrees to risk his life, wouldn't it be wise to collect some of the money upfront as an insurance policy? But with a plot that gets dumber along the way, why bother.Now the obvious happens. The plane crashes on the island leaving the dumb folks stranded and virtually no way to call for help. A dinosaur attacks them and normally this would be exciting but hey, we already saw this in 1 & 2. Now for the real fun. The missing boys mom, (Tea Leoni) barely escapes death from a dinosaur but soon after wards is screaming her sons name out at the top of her lungs giving the invite for every dino alive to come and have her for lunch. But there is still 45 minutes left of this slop so of course, nothing happens.Eventually, Grant finds their son Erik who is really the only interesting character in the movie. He's fairly bright and considering how stupid his parents are, you figure he must have been adopted.One (and I mean only one) exciting scene are the flying lizards that the group encounters. This sequence works well until one guy is grabbed by a lizard causing him to plunge into the river but only to survive with only a minor bruise. (Some may feel I'm giving something away, but in a movie where everything is so utterly predictable, I doubt I've spoiled it for everyone)One of the many reasons that the 1st Jurassic Park worked so well is that it was like nothing we had seen before. Wonder kind Steven Spielberg didn't rely on cartoon animation to give us the eye popping effects. Every character was interesting and virtually all the situations were believable. Although the second was missing some of the thrills of discovery, Spielberg made it work.At only 85 minutes long, Jurassic Park 3 follows the many sequels that shouldn't have been made but it did what it was intended to do; grab a worldwide gross of $365 million and offer nothing in return.Note Famous movie critic Roger Ebert gave the horrendous Jaws 4 a no star rating but gave Jurassic Park 3 a thumbs up.

All the earlier films in these franchises were genuine classics.POSSIBLE SPOILERS The original Jurassic Park was a stunning, groundbreaking feat in film-making by the legend that is Steven Spielberg. I loved it. The second was a welcome follow up, up until the farcical finale. They should have ended 'The Lost World' when they leave the island and left the Jurassic Park films alone. Instead we have a T-Rex made to look comical and totally undignified, chasing buses, drinking from swimming pools and eating dog kennels.And then theres JP3. Where to start. It has to be with Spinosaurus. Spinosaurus! What is that all about? It eats a mobile phone and kills the star of the first two, the T-Rex. Rapters having a conversation with each other! What will they do in the 4th? Strut around with mobiles and pagers, and give each other a call when they spot potential prey! Spino already has one.The pterodactils (the ones with the wings for non-specialists) section was a worthy addition and should have been given more attention before this when these films had an ounce of respect.Oh just a couple more things. If a dinosaur has swallowed a phone it would digest in its stomach. You would not hear it ringing from inside a dinosaur's belly. Why don't the rapters just eat them at the end, after they successfully negotiate the return of their eggs? They just leave them to escape with the navy who, without being noticed,  magically turn up in boats and helicopters on the other side of a few trees .As you have probably grasped by now this film frustrated me somewhat and is just as frustrating now as it was when it came out.

The director, Joe Johnston, proved that he only serves to direct comedies (is the director of Jumanji and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids). The script is a shame and looks more like a parody of Spielberg's movies than something that we should take seriously. The characters are totally improbable, and who saw the first movies will never believe that a child can survive with such dangerous animals more than two or three days. The only positive note is the performance of Sam Neill, lending talent to a film that should have been lost in the bowels of the dinosaurs he portrays before coming to our homes.

So much so, I don't know where to begin.Was the downfall the awful (and over-)acting? The terrible dialogue &#x96; including one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes, when the raptor calls out Alan's name? The downsized special effects? The sheer mockery of using the classic original score to remind us of a better film? The idiotic reasons to get both Laura Dern back and Sam Neill as well as Sammy back on an island full of dinos? How about the Saving Private Ryan Spielberg tribute finale or was it Jungle-Boy? (More on that atrocity later.) Or&#x85;was it the insanely 568th zoom-in/close up of the both the actors, namely Mr. Initforthemoney Neill, and the dinosaurs?Mercifully, the movie's only attribute was its 92 minute length. After you get past that sigh of relief and the regret of wasting those precious 92 minutes knowing all well you shouldn't have returned to the island with Mr. Spiralingdowncareer Neill, you have silly people running around doing and saying silly things making you wonder why this wasn't rated G. Heck, it was basically animated with some of the dinosaurs. Some that even talk!And what's worse? A character that vows never to step into the land of the lost-scripts, but sells out with the deposit of a check or an actor that does the same? What's that old phrase Fool me once&#x85;well, Alan (Neill) did make this very same mistake in JP1 but you'll have to forgive him though he was offered money, he was tricked onto the island of the dinos. Here, he, well&#x85;was offered money and was tricked onto the island of the dinos. How does someone of such idiocy become a doctor?I digress, he isn't real and this just further proof of poor screenplay writing &#x96; and from three different men, one of which I WILL NOT forgive Alexander Payne, author of excellent movies such as Election and Sideways.And speaking of poorly written Part IIIs, I'm sure it's already been stated this is the Jaws 3D of our generation with the coincidence of Spielberg directing both part ones of the series mentioned. Thankfully, in 2001, the 3D re-trend hadn't begun yet, so I can imagine this movie actually could've been worse with the use of 3D. Though they certainly tried to&#x85;with all those damned close-ups.I have NOT seen so many close ups in my life. Back in 2001, when I saw this movie for the first (of now only two) time(s), I saw it with a buddy friend of mine. We laughed our asses off throughout &#x96; yeah, laughing at it, but one of the things that were hilarious, though annoying, were the zoom in creatures, including the actors. This occurs roughly every 2-3, maybe 5, minutes of screen time. The last straw towards the ending when my friend wanted to put his fist through a wall in the fiftieth time they showed off their graphics of the dinos, the scene was set-up and was, once again another zoom in on one of the creatures. My buddy saw it coming and he warned me if they&#x85;if they do it&#x85; Of course, we always had the same response of whenever they did we would say to each other Alan? as in the first of many horrid scenes towards the beginning when a raptor speaks Alan's name to him&#x85;on an airplane.Anyways, I better seal off this review, though I am happy now that I've seen it, it's fresher in my mind to review it and now I never, ever have to see it again. The BASIC plot is idiot male takes Erik (Trevor Morgan, a.k.a. Jungle-Boy) on a Dino-Soar expedition of the restricted island of dinosaurs left vacant (of humans, supposedly) from JP2. Inevitably, they crash onto the island.In comes Mommy & Daddy, too inept to barely walk and chew at the same time yelling out idiot lines and gestures. They hire sell-out Alan to just fly over the island, but in reality, they're there to get back their son who's been gone for two months. Literally, after the AGAIN inevitable crash the movie turns to some odd-ball screw-ball comedy with all-but zero original ideas of how to now use the dinosaurs on screen.Then&#x85;Just when you thought it was safe to&#x85;wait, let me start over&#x85;Just when you thought JP3 couldn't get any worse, in comes Jungle-Boy to the rescue. And let's give him some credit he is one humble kid. After incredibly surviving eight weeks without training, adequate supplies, company, help or hope, his first concern when found Golly gee wilikers, I hope mom and dad are getting along!He swoops in (believe me, this had me and my buddy roaring in laughter in the theatre), saves Alan from the seventh near-death situation, who promptly has a very nice and calm conversation about Alan's books (again, see JP1), about how mommy & daddy are getting along while Alan unforgivingly eats the kid's precious final food scraps.At any rate, this leads to that, that leads to more of the same and the conclusion will have you, for the umpteenth time laughing out loud.Just skip the throw-away JP3.

Spielberg knew how to spotlight the wonder and power of these wonderful creatures, and Goldblum gave the films it's intelligence and it's heart.

Now this would have worked if there were more to the story than that but unfortunately there is not, and it does not even try to be anything other than that. The whole discussion about The danger of playing god is tossed out for a run in the mill monster movie that has no brains or heart. Sam Neil is a very good actor but his character reminds us on why Jeff Goldblum character is so important to the series. One hint, Goldblum's character had brains, and a sense of humor. Sam Neil's Character has nether. If he did, he would have had the parents of the missing kid checked out before he agreed to go with them on the island. The parents of the missing kid are in fact so dumb, and so annoying that you end up wishing that they would be eaten by the dinosaurs, as for the screen writers and the director of the abomination of a film. There is barely any mention of the first two films, and the story does not even make any lead way into trying to connect it's self to those movies.  It does not even make sense in some aspects of the story, like how the Spinosauris even got on the island in the first place. It was not in The Lost World, so why is it in this one?

The end result is a dull, unimaginative film filled with stupid characters, unrealistic plot twists, and not so impressive CGI creatures. This film wastes no time to introduce us to the characters, but it does not bother to develop them. Most of them die pretty quickly anyway. Of course, we are introduced to a child in the latter half of the film, and this character manages to be more irritating than all the rest combined. Apparently he has been living all alone for two months, evading giant meat-eaters and actually having fun. He almost seems sad that the show is over and shows no emotional reaction to the fact that he is not only being rescued, but that his parents are on the dino-infested island. It all ends with a deus ex machina that overshadows the one from the first film (of course, they could not use that one, because they used it early in the film, in a scene where they are saved from a dinosaur by having another dinosaur show up and start a fight with it, allowing the characters to escape in the confusion). Does anyone know how many islands inhabited by dinosaurs there are, and who is in charge? Who cares? There are people being chased by dinosaurs, and that's what you paid to see, right? So shut up and stop asking questions.This film was made for no other reason but to squeeze even more money from the franchise, and it exhibits no traces of genuine desire to create something artistic.

Oh, and I shouldn't really call the main character emotionless. His thing is to grunt and complain and give warnings about the island's danger, even though no one really dies except a few background people and one character who gets about 30 minutes on screen. What a dick of a main character. No one here is likable. Unless you count Udesky, played by Michael Jeter (RIP) who seems to be the only quiet and innocent character.

With Jurassic Park III, however, we now have two very capable films to compare this one to, and this, on top of several issues this installment bears, work to not only derail a franchise that had fairly solid footing in the ground but managed to defy odds to become one of the few defining films in American history for its special effects.Jurassic Park III can't manage to conjure up the same kind of danger that the original film did, nor the moodiness and the energetic cast of misfits of the second film. It plays like a theme park ride, with little sense of danger and a heavy sense of perfunctory happenings that simply occur in without much added spark of ingenuity or creativity behind them. Where Steven Spielberg had a method to his madness, and a terrific sense of buildup in both of his films, director Joe Johnston and writers Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne (yes, Election and Sideways Alexander Payne), and Jim Taylor simply stumble when trying to find a route to take with Jurassic Park III that works and breeds new life into material that's beginning to show signs of wear.We refocus on Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) of the first film, who is now refreshed with the events of Jurassic Park out of his mind. Despite saying he has no ambition to return to a life involving dinosaurs, Dr. Grant meets a man named Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and his wife Amanda (Téa Leoni), who cut him a blank check to give them an aerial tour of the island of Isla Sorna. He reluctantly agrees until, while on the plane, realizes that the Kirby's want to land on and explore the island, resulting in a plane crash that leaves the three of them, plus Grant's son Billy (Alessandro Nivola) and a handful of Kirby's men, stranded in a playground filled with dinosaurs. Worst of all, many of the dinosaurs are Pterodactyls, soaring menaces that hunt for prey on the ground before scooping them up and taking off without a trace.The Pterodactyls steal the show in this film, for they are the ones who are unpredictable, quick-witted, and more entertaining to watch than the group of misplaced actors on display. The Lost World had the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, and Vince Vaughn, all actors you wouldn't think would star in a Jurassic Park film, but somehow found their way onto the set and decided to make due with what they had. In turn, they turned into be a cast of likable character actors, making for one of the most surprisingly functional misfit casts I have yet to see.Jurassic Park III, on the other hand, is what happens when a series of actors find themselves working together and something feels off. It's not really an involvement thing, but there seems to be a general level of discomfort amongst the actors; actors like Macy and Leoni seem terribly out of place with a film like this, and no character, not even Grant, bears any likability throughout the course of the film. The original Jurassic Park had its share of empty characters, but at least devoted enough time to them to show that Spielberg and company were trying to provide audiences with an even balance of talking and action, whereas The Lost World found a way to more-or-less balance the dichotomy out to a rather effective level. Jurassic Park III can't seem to do either very convincingly; it's too busy trying to set up the next action sequence when it focuses on the characters and is too busy looking for an easy way out during the action sequences.Finally, there's the emotionally manipulative angle that comes up with this film too, particularly in the ending, which ties everything together with a very incredulous circumstance combined with cloying choral music to let us know that everybody involved is safe and sound. This kind of thing only works to soil the scope and power of the original film and the kind of dark, brooding atmosphere The Lost World bravely built. The special effects are still strong, only this time, merging CGI with animatronics leaves a bit of a hokiness to the dinosaurs, particularly the Velociraptor, which bears a feathery coat (while this may be more scientifically accurate, it looks messy and unbelievable on-screen). Where the other two films were creating a powerhouse franchise in film, Jurassic Park III is looking for a quick buck, and that part is evident from the cast choices, the writing, and the general feel, all of which feel significantly squandered and traded in for something convenient rather than daring.Starring Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, and Alessandro Nivola. Directed by Joe Johnston.

I mean a really good movie; one you can leave the theater thinking your money was well spent.  I haven't felt that way in a long long time.  Hollywood lately is simply spewing out movies as fast as possible.  Plots, who cares, as long as it makes them money.  They're going for quantity and not quality.  After watching the movie Jurassic Park 3 (all 1 hour and 20 minutes of it), I was extremely mad.  80 minutes!!!! I didn't know that was even possible. I mean we know the dinos are fake by now, so how can it be scary.  I know add Tea Leoni screaming and running around like her head is cut off for half the movie. What were these people thinking&#133; oh yeah the $$.  That's all Hollywood cares about anymore.  All these sequels that we don't need, Pitch Black 2, Batman 4, The Mummy Returns, James Bond where Pierce Brosnan sleeps with every woman he comes into contact with.  It's disgusting what the world is coming to.  I admit there are good movies out there, but they're sparse.  I don't understand how critics could give movies that are clearly garbage, good ratings.  I mean if a movie is done by Spielberg, or Lucas, it automatically adds an extra couple of points to the score. Believe me that if John Carpenter had done A.I. it would have been seen as one of the biggest rip offs.  Pinocchio, the movie D.A.R.Y.L., this was practically the same story with somewhat of a twist and lots of special effects.  Which brings me to another point. It seems that moviemakers are so caught up in the effects of movies they'll use them to an extent, which is extremely overdone. If anyone has seen the preview for Spiderman yet, you'll know, the man looks like a shiny piece of metal.  This may be pushing it but the dino's in JP3 looked too real, I mean the spikes on top of their heads were metallic and almost multicolored.  Now I know not everybody agrees with me, but I also know that there are a lot of people who do.  Frankly we are fed up with going to the movies and seeing crap, and we're not going to take it anymore&#133; "}{"Title":"Awful","Date":"7 December 2001","Score":"19 out of 27 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  JP3 stinks terribly.

Steven Spielberg has made more than ten blockbusters. I dont like E.T. but it is a really successful movie.The first Jurassic Park was an excellent movie. Sure parts of it were boring and could have been five minutes shorter but Jp3 could have been half an hour longer. Out of all three the Lost World is one of my all time favorite movies. The action is so much better than the other two. The Trexes are the best in this movie. Sure there is not many Raptor scenes in the movie but the ones that are in it are awesome. Jurassic Park and Lost World are on my top 100 list. JP3 is far from that list. Jp3 has a great beginning. Its exciting and a little creepy but not that scary. I heard that this movie was supposed to be a huge Thriller. I wasn't thrilled by one second of the movie. I think most of the scenes with the spinosaurus were stupid. I did like that boat scene but it was not my favorite. The raptors were stupid in that movie. No scenes with them were good. The pteranodon scenes were awesome. The best in the movie. But just when it starts to get interesting it ends. Leaving it open for a sequel. Which if it is not directed by Steven spielberg i will not be going.

Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, and Michael JeterRelease Date July 18, 2001MPAA Rating PG-13 for intense sci-fi terror and violenceRuntime 1 hour and 33 minutesStudio Universal PicturesI'm back and here to review the third film of the Jurassic Park franchise, Jurassic Park III. I haven't read the novels that the first two films were based on, but I heard that this one was not based on a novel. Instead, Jurassic Park III was original film story and I heard that this story took elements from the two novels that weren't in the first two films. Also, instead of Steven Spielberg (who directed the first two Jurassic Park films), this one is directed by Joe Johnston, who is the director of films such as Jumanji and Captain America The First Avenger. Just like its predecessor, when Jurassic Park III was released, it received poor reception from both critics and audiences. However, even though I think that The Lost World Jurassic Park is very underrated, I have to agree with most people that Jurassic Park III sucks.The plot of Jurassic Park III takes place 8 years after the events of Jurassic Park. With not having to deal with any more living dinosaurs, Dr. Alan Grant is now a happy man. However, businessman Paul Kirby offers Grant money, if he flies both him and his wife, Amanda over Isla Sorna (the island featured in the second film). However Mr. Kirby lands on the island and it is revealed that the Kirby's are looking for their son, Eric, who crash-landed on the island while paragliding with Mrs. Kirby's boyfriend, Ben Hildebrand. Now being stuck on the island, Grant, along with his assistant, Billy, and the Kirby's, must find Eric and escape Isla Sorna, which has many dangers including a velociraptor pack, and a new carnivorous dinosaur Spinosaurus (which is even bigger than a T. rex).The acting is not very good. There are only two performances that I think are solid. First off, we have Sam Neil who is still awesome as Alan Grant. The other one is William H. Macy as Paul Kirby. i thought that he was also good. Aside from those two performances though, the rest of the acting just isn't very good. The rest the actors try, but most of them (aside from Neil and Macy) honestly felt mediocre and kinda wooden.The technical aspect of this film is not very good either. The CGI is honestly pretty terrible as there is way to much of it, resulting in the CGI effects not looking realistic at all. There are a few attempts at practical effects, but even those attempts fail. For example, there are some scenes where the spinosaurus actually looks like a robot, as opposed to a dinosaur. Joe Johnston is probably a good director, but his direction fro this film feels very bland (Steven Spielberg was a much better director than Joe Johnston), and as a result, the action sequences feel dull and are very forgettable.Now, let's talk about the script. I know that Jurassic Park III is the third Jurassic park film (most third installments in franchises don't turn out to be very good and some of them are flat out awful), but this movie has a terrible screenplay. I did like the first act of this film, but after that it goes downhill from there. My biggest problem with the movie is that, despite having Jurassic Park in the title, it doesn't feel like a Jurassic Park movie. The first 2 film had a man vs. nature element to them, which made them more than your standard monster movie. Jurassic Park III, however, felt like a standard 93 minute chase sequence. This is mainly because most of the film consists of characters running away from dinosaurs (mainly either the velociraptor pack or the spinosaurus). The characters are also flat, which strips the film of any stakes, because the main plot revolves around their survival, but these characters are so dull that there is no investment to be found here. This movie also had some ridiculously silly comments whether it be a plot hole or a jump scare. For example, we are expected to believe that a spinosaurus can smash though a metal fence, but it can't smash through a wooden door (just watch the movie and you'll see what I mean). that is just so stupid. Don't even get me started on that fact that this movie tells us that even though a phones is in a spinosaurus's stomach, the group can still hear it from outside the spinosaurus's stomach. It's just ridiculous.Overall, I hated this movie. It has its fun moments but it is still too dull, silly, and worst of all, boring to recommend. The only new thing that this movie does is by making the spinosaursus the big carnivorous dinosaur, as opposed to the T-rex. Other than that, it's very standard and, like I said before, dull (at least The Lost World tried something new). I hope that Jurassic World improves upon this.I'm going to give Jurassic Park III a D+ (30%).

Director Steven Spielberg and best-selling author Michael Crichton, who collaborated on the superlative Jurassic Park (1993) and the knockout sequel The Lost World (1997), had something to say about scientists who play God and the dangers of cloning. Sadly, Spielberg and Crichton had nothing to do with this sequel. Former Star Wars art director Joe Johnston of October Sky (1999), The Rocketeer (1991), and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids (1989) replaced Spielberg. You'd think Johnston's experience on Jumanji (1995) where zoo animals stomped everything in sight, would have made him an ideal candidate. Unfortunately, it didn't. You can count the major differences between Johnston's Jurassic Park and Spielberg's Jurassic Parks in minutes. JP3 clocks in at about 90 minutes, while both Spielberg epics exceeded two hours. Although it isn't as pretentious as the first two movies, JP3 relies far more on humor than horror to its detriment. This lukewarm, less-than-savage installment in the cloned-dinosaurs-run-amok series makes references to its predecessors that only hardcore, nitpicking Jurassic Park fans could catch. The joke about Jack Horner was cute. The dinosaurs are just as menacing, even though bloodthirsty moviegoers may feel cheated. (Imagine what Italian gorefest cult director Lucio Fulci would have done with a Jurassic Park movie.) Missing this time around is 'chaos theoretician' Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum of Independence Day), who enlivened both the original and the follow-up with his sarcasm. Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill of Jurassic Park), who skipped out on The Lost World, returns as the dullest of dull heroes, while Grant's former colleague Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern of October Sky) reappears in a welcome cameo. Grant visits her in the opening scene and finds her happily married to a U.S. State Department official with a toddler son and baby daughter. Before she waves goodbye, Ellie reminds Grant to call her if he ever needs her help. Predictably, freshman scenarist Peter Buchman, along with writers Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor of Election and Citizen Ruth don't let her welsh on her promise. Film scriptwriting manuals classify this as 'foreshadowing,' setting up some future action so it doesn't appear to haphazardly pop up out of the blue.Basically, JP3 follows the formula that Jurassic Park and The Lost World created with greater detail and daring. Reportedly, after Johnston perused the shooting script, he tore it up and ordered rushed rewrites. If this was the best they could contrive, no wonder JP3 is so forgettable. Not only did The Lost World raise the stakes, but it also surpassed the original with its thrills and chills. Clearly, the third time wasn't the charm. Jurassic Park 3 is as pedestrian as Jaws 3. If you've seen the others, you know Laura Dern's cameo at the outset is standard Jurassic Park practice. In The Lost World, Malcolm reunited briefly with John Hammond (Richard Attenborough of The Great Escape) and his grandchildren Timothy 'Tim' Murphy (Joseph Mazzello) and Alexis 'Lex' Murphy (Ariana Richards) in an early scene. Children cannot die in the Jurassic Park franchise. Neither apparently can mother nor fathers. So much for suspense. Like Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park 3 has our desperate heroes plundering piles of dinosaur dung in search of a satellite phone that could serve as their salvation. That stinking satellite phone infuriated me initially when I heard it ring. I figured that some fool had left their cell phone ringer on in the theatre! Nevertheless, Sarah Harding owned a tattered camera bag she called her lucky bag, just as Belly Brennan sorts a similar camera bag. The scene where Tea Leoni hangs from a tree as ravenous raptors leap up at her alludes to the kitchen scene near the end of Jurassic Park. Instead of being jostling about in small recreational vehicles, Dr. Grant finds himself slammed around in the wrecked fuselage of a plane by a dinosaur. This scene lacks the sheer terror of the T-Rex's introduction in Jurassic Park and doesn't generate the suspense of The Lost World cliffhanger scene. Billy steals raptor eggs, and the mothers pursue them across Isla Sorna in a variation on The Lost World heroes that freed an injured T-Rex baby with a broken leg and found its irate mother pushing their motor home over a cliff. The Lost World T-Rexes subjected the motor home to more hair-raising demolition than the JP3 T-Rex does to the plane. This time around baby Pterodactyls attack a teenager, much as The Lost World lizards swarmed after a little rich girl. The major revelation here is the raptors can communicate with each other and might possibly have supplanted primates. Wait, didn't those same raptors communicate with each other back in Jurassic Park in the kitchen scene? Jurassic Park and The Lost World definitely weren't for the squeamish, but Jurassic Park 3 should give nobody nightmares. As in the first two entries, the genetically engineered dinosaurs walk tough, howl vividly, and snap up hapless humans in their jaws. Indeed, the visual effects technology has improved exponentially; sadly, the art of scriptwriting has regressed just as much. Unlike Spielberg, Johnston takes neither the plot nor the stakes to a higher level. Moreover, nothing in Jurassic Park 3 matches either the T-Rex gobbling up the lawyer, Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero of Get Shorty), in the original or the scenes from The Lost World where two T-Rexes tore poor Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) apart. Grant calls Ellie when a real dino tries to chomp and/or drown everybody. Hilariously, her young son delays taking her the phone so he can watch his favorite Barney the Purple Dinosaur episode! The out of place Barney scene deflates any suspense or tension that the Site B dinosaur causes as he rips away at a cage housing our heroes. Anybody who thrilled to the first two Jurassic Park creature features will probably roll their eyeballs in disbelief at the infantile idiocy of Jurassic Park 3.

I am surprised anyone can write positive comments about this movie that has no plot, no character development whatsoever and relies solely on special effects, and even those are not very good. In addition the movie is totally unrealistic. Not that having dinosaurs running around is very believable, but at least on the first movie of the sequel there was an attempt to explain rationally and scientifically what was happening (i.e how the dinosaurs were created) and that kept the movie interesting at different levels. All of that is gone on the third movie and we are left with a bunch of carnivorous dinosaurs (the vegetarians are only shown briefly at the end of the movie) set on eating humans (despite the large preys that lay dead at their pawtips) and pursuing the main characters during the entire movie -the remaining humans that is since half the cast dies within the first half an hour. The dinosaurs are clearly more intelligent than the human counterparts (which is not that surprising given how stupid the characters are) and set traps for them to which humans succumb (instead of the other way around). Fortunately they are saved from some perils by a 12 year old (the one who was supposed to be rescued) who has managed to live unfazed on this hostile environment where half a dozen commando style dudes armed to the teeth have been killed on the first few hours after setting foot on the island (someone explain THAT to me??!!!). To top the chart of ridiculous situations we have a paleobotanist of a God forsaken university who manages to mobilize the entire US air-force in a matter of hours. In sum, among the worst movies I have ever seen if not the WORST. I had never seen such a steady stream of people leaving the movie theater half-way through the story. I stayed until the end hoping that it would get better. It never did. Avoid this movie. Spare yourself the misery, don't waste 90 minutes of your precious life.

How can a film so completely turn its back on the premise of the franchise (and more importantly the books which structured it)? How can you screw up such a basic but entertaining idea? Well, Jurassic Park III does a pretty good job of the above.Starting off with this film butchering of the themes of the series. The whole idea of Jurassic park (the novel and subsequent films) was that it depicted the dinosaurs,for the first time, as normal animals not monsters. I mean Sam Neill in JP even explicitly stated this. The idea of life finding a way was draped all over the first film and The Lost World continued that on, however JP III does not follow this idea in a variety of ways The Raptor's can communicate? The Spinosauraus has no incentive to attack the actors but it just does. The raptors are intelligent enough to let the main characters go free at the end but savagely kill anybody else who they believe have their eggs?Another instance of the slaughter of Jurassic Park is the look of the Dinosaurs themselves. Many are new or have been given a makeover and most look and act more aggressively than the previous films. (I mean the Brachiorsauraus went from a typical mottled green look to a red and green monster with sharp teeth?). On the DVD extras the people who worked on this film boast about how real the animals looked but I honestly didn't see that in the film. Apart from the fact that they jiggle and are fatter than before there is little inspiration. Come to think of it all the new dinosaurs appeared to be either red or green or a bit of both...However what really annoyed me (and it seems many others) was the killing of T-Rex and the emergence of Spinosauraus. They have a sort of Kenobi-Vader Showdown where T-Rex (the master who hunts only for the need for food) is killed by Spino (the learner who seems to rather enjoy chasing the people around and kill other dinosaurs for no reason. It is explained why they are chased by Spino but the reason is so pitiful its an obvious after thought. But getting back to the point, Killing off T-Rex? Big mistake. It has sparked quite a debate about who would actually win. From what I've heard Spino was bigger but T-Rex was designed to tackle large prey while Spino was more equipped for fish. No matter what some people may say about Spino being bigger that doesn't necessary mean it would be a better fighter...I mean a basketball player is bigger than a boxer but who would you pick in a fight? Although obviously for the makers of JPIII Bigger=Better. On a side note I wonder which T-Rex it was from TLW?As stated before little plot was involved in the film and being only 90 minutes long that is unsurprising. 90 minutes? Where did the suspense go from the previous two films? The reason for this? It's a non-stop action film, it is claimed. Fine if we're talking about a video-game movie but not for Jurassic Park. I look at it this way, on a pure entertainment level at least The Lost World has 30 minutes more value than JP III. The makers completely lost the focus of the franchise in this film.The makers to their cried did try to put in a little continuity i.e. the smashed windows of the car in the compound for example, as the film was based on the same island as TLW but it seemed poorly done. Why is the island so different from before? From wide open grassy plains and coniferous forests to tight claustrophobic jungles? A lot is left unexplained...And the raptors? That deserves an article on its own...Another stupid point was again the idea of kid being able to survive a situation where full grown adults with guns cannot. 8 weeks? When experienced mercenaries barely survive for 5 minutes? Especially when this kid is all arrogant and chuffed about his exploits on the island and would probably get eaten because his big fat head would get wedged in the tankers trap doorBoy Oh look at meeeee I collected T-Rex urine. Aren't I the greatest?Grant How'd you get it?Boy Errr. (thinking fast), You don't want to know...The final nail though was the death of Alan Grant. Not the man per say but the likability of the character. He was involved, he is now dead, a redundant entity in the franchise. One of the best characters in the series snuffed out in the blink of an eye, tainted by association to this atrocity. And speaking generally about characters, who actually liked the Kirby family or Billy?So in summary, no plot, no good characters, tired, bored acting, an annoying kid, killing T-REX? Disgrace.... I mean it just didn't feel like the survival orientated first two films, more a cheap monster film. The only positive is they continued to use moving models which is an almost forgotten method in cinema. But apart from that avoid like the plague.

Spielberg opted to not return to helm another Jurassic film, and directing duties were passed over to Joe Johnston. Jurassic Park 3 see's the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant, from Jurassic Park. Laura Dern also returns as Ellie Sattler, but sadly in a less prominent role. The story for JP3 is quite simple, Grant is lured by adventurous couple Paul, & Amanda Kirby, played by William H. Macy & Tea Leoni, to fly over Isla Sorna, with Grant acting as their guide, for money. However the Kirby's are not rich, and lied to Grant so he could help them find their missing son Eric, who wen't missing weeks ago in a parasailing accident near the island. Of course things go wrong, the plane crashes leaving the Kirby's, Grant, his colleague Billy, and a few others stranded on the island. JP3 can only be enjoyed as a trilling dinosaur spectacle, but there isn't much of anything new, or interesting.There are some positives aspects in this film, Sam Neill is a fine actor, and he brings credibility to the film, and is still believable as the Grant character. While the rest of the characters aren't all that fleshed out, the film is well acted, with William H. Macy, and Sam Neill being the standouts. There's a few new dinosaurs, Spinosaurus being the main one. Spinosaurus is a neat dinosaur, and the roar for Spinosaurus is also well executed, and is distinctly different sounding from the now famous T- Rex roar. The animatronic dinosaurs/CGI are once again well executed by Stan Winston's team, and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM). JP3 is the first film in the series to combine CGI dinosaurs along with practical ones in the same shot, and the blending between the two is well done. The Spinosaurus attack on the river is a thrilling scene, taking place in water, which hadn't been done. There is also a thrilling Pteranodon sequence, offering a ariel attack which hasn't been seen yet in the franchise. The scene is dimly lit, with fog, and creates the best sense of suspense in the movie. The music in the scene is probably my favorite bit of new music in the film. John Williams didn't score JP3, instead composer Don Davis best known for his work in The Matrix films, provides the music, and does a good job, creating new music that still fits stylistically within the franchise.Though there are positives in JP3 there are many negatives as well. One of the biggest ones I had was the screenwriters not having Grant, and Ellie as a couple. Instead they have a friendship type relationship, and Ellie has a child (with some random guy) who call's Grant the dinosaur man. It just seems stupid to not have Grant be with Ellie after the events of the first film. Grant's character arch of not wanting children changes after he saves Lex, and Tim, and is seemingly ready to settle down with Ellie, which now seems wasted. The dumbest thing about it is it adds nothing to the characters, or the overall film, and was a stupid decision on the writers part. Grant has a dream on the plane nearing the island, and turns to see a raptor that says Alan. The scene is very cheesy, and really is just plain silly, right up there with the gymnast scene in TLW. The Spinosaurus T-Rex fight is neat, but having the T-Rex (a fan favorite) lose, and die, just didn't sit right with many fans, myself included. The characters (while well acted), aren't all that interesting, or all that likable, the Kirby's put peoples lives in danger to find their son, and Billy, decides it would be a good idea to steal raptor eggs to help fund their research back home. There are also many continuity issues in the film, like why the island doesn't look the way it did in TLW, or why the raptors look radically different (some have feather-like quills on their head) from how they did in the pervious films. Where the Spinosaurus was during the events of TLW is suspicious too, the only clue given in the film is when Grant says that Spinosaurus wasn't on Ingen's list. Perhaps the worst part of JP3 is it's ending, which feels insanely rushed, and anti-climantic, almost as if the filmmakers said This is going on too long, lets wrap it up, but with a runtime just over 90 minutes, the abrupt conclusion seems strange, with the previous films being over two hours long. Jurassic Park 3 despite is faults, and there are multiple ones, is still an enjoyable flick for what it is, but it's a huge step down in terms of story, and character, and is just an unnecessary edition to the franchise. The story isn't very interesting, or inspired, and the only thing new in the film are the look of the raptors, and a few new dinosaurs. It's explained during a dinner scene with Grant, and Ellie that the raptors were far more intelligent than imagined, and could talk to each other, but much of this could be assumed in the previous films. Spinosaurus makes for a cool looking successor to T-Rex, but seems more like a movie monster than an animal, compared to T-Rex who while running around chasing/eating people, had moments in both Jurassic Park, and The Lost World that showed a naturalistic side of them, like caring for the infant T-Rex. The only real advances in Jurassic Park 3 are technical ones, but effects aren't what makes a film great, it's the story, and characters that drive a film, and that wasn't strong enough in this entry of the Jurassic Park series.

The characters are sub-standard, the story is lazy and shamefully contrived, and the effects aren't as good as either of the previous movies, almost seeming to be a parody of a Jurassic Park film.The plot, as thin as it is, centres around the rescue of a boy named Eric who ended up stranded on the now restricted Isla Sorna, and the survival of the rescue team led by Alan Grant. Alan is lured to Isla Sorna by seemingly rich businessman Paul Kirby on the promise of cash to fund his dig. The plane lands and Amanda Kirby, Paul's wife, attracts the attention of Spinosaurus which causes the plane to crash and devour members of the crew. The rest of the movie is a series of chase scenes involving the Spinosaurus and the Velociraptors, interrupted by cloying domestic drama between the Kirbys reuniting with Eric and coming back together. The climax itself is unsatisfying, requiring a military deus ex machina that just feels tacked on.In all fairness, Sam Neill does a good job at bringing a jaded Alan Grant to the screen, working with what little he had. But his character is ruined by undoing his arc in the first film about learning to love kids and marrying Ellie, here Ellie is married to another man with two children. The writers could have prepared something special involving Alan and Ellie's relationship and their place in the world with live dinosaurs on the planet; it was insulting to undo all that development. His scenes in the prologue had potential, showing Alan's struggle to keep palaeontology alive and rekindle his love of dinosaurs. But it all amounts to nothing.The film has only a few worthwhile action scenes, specifically the Raptor attacks and the group's encounter with a colony of Pteranodons in a giant aviary, a memorable scene conveyed with an eerie and mysterious atmosphere. Some of the musical cues are melodic and charming, but I yearn for John Williams's talent. At times, the visual effects for the Raptors are actually quite good, but the rest are incredibly rushed and don't allow the audience to soak it in like in the first film. Due to the weak writing and wasted characters there are the many stupid moments throughout the movie. Barely twenty minutes into the film, Alan has a dream about a talking raptor on the flight to Sorna, it's intended to be scary and foreshadow the Raptors' capability of speech but it comes off as childish and goofy. (Real life raptors weren't even capable of human-level speech patterns). The ever annoying Amanda Kirby seems to exist only to scream, bicker and run away, never contributing anything but maudlin or moronic moments. William H. Macy is completely wasted. The rest of the characters are bland and forgettable. Some outright stupid moments include a satellite phone being heard from the belly of a Spinosaurus, said Spinosaur is shown as being able to break a fence designed to contain dinosaurs yet cannot break down a rusty metal door, a ridiculous cameo of Barney (I wish I was joking!!), and a cheap regurgitation of the dino dung scene from the first film.Even the dinosaurs themselves have been ruined; the CGI herbivores are pushed to the background with little screen time, and the carnivores don't behave like real animals, like in the previous films. The animatronics are clunky and the CGI is too obvious. The movie tries to recreate the sense of awe and wonder from the first film, but it feels forced and artificial.The most obnoxious change is the addition of the Spinosaurus. While I accept that it was larger than T-Rex, Spinosaurus was not a rampaging movie monster that hunted human-sized morsels like a serial killer. This leads into the infamous duel between the Rex and the Spinosaur, and it's a problem because the T-Rex was an integral part of the previous films and a childhood favourite. The fight itself was overly brief and anticlimactic. The T-Rex was set up as a predator with both ferocity and nobility, having it dispatched in such a way feels like a cheap shot. It was just a botched attempt to showcase a dinosaur that hadn't earned it's stardom like the Raptors.What frustrates me the most about 'Jurassic Park III' is that there was potential to make up for some or more of the shortcomings of 'The Lost World'. Instead it's the shallowest and the least adventurous film of the entire trilogy, there's too much focus on the domestic drama. While the first two films dealt with themes of science, technology, playing god, and man vs. nature, 'Jurassic Park III' took the franchise away from exploring such themes, choosing to be safe and marketable and lacking in substance.

The third installment Terrible. Where was the adventure? Where was the excitement? Where was the suspense? Where was the danger? Drained of all the qualities of what made the first one so memorable. This could be blamed primarily on the director, Joe Johnston, who made that box-office bomb The Rocketeer nineteen years ago. What more can be said? At least the special effects were good; the fight between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus and the scene with the Pterodactyls but the plot was basically nonexistent and the acting was wooden and lifeless with no sense of conveying believability. And what's with the theory on raptor intelligence part? Were they assuming that raptors were smarter than birds and primates? One needs only to read various books on dinosaurs to find out. Seriously I don't expect movies to educate audiences but a little research wouldn't have hurt. I first saw this on opening day expecting more action, adventure, suspense, danger, and terror. Yet I got a lot less bang for the buck. A fine example on what happens when you switch directors mid franchise.Not even up to par with the original. Pure piece of crap.

I have a special place in my heart for Spielberg's wonderfully beautiful, and terrifyingly real Jurassic Park universe. With JP 3, the directorial torch was passed to Joe Johnston. The result is a film that strays far away from the first two adventures, but holds it's own as a fun dinosaur thrill ride.The story is simple. Our beloved paleontologist, Alan Grant returns as the hero of the film and finds himself duped by a divorced couple into visiting Site B in order to find their missing son. Tea Leoni and William H. Macy play the divorced couple, and they are good as typical Midwestern, suburban parents, but almost none of the other side characters feel like real people at all. With the exception of the kid, they are basically dino food from the beginning. The lone bright spot regarding the characters is probably Sam Neil's return as Alan Grant. He's the only major returning player from the first two movies, and he acts as someone we do care about over the course of the story. There aren't many twists or turns in the story. There is a subplot about some stolen raptor eggs that keeps some tension alive, but the story doesn't have half the kick of the original or even Spielberg's sequel.From the very start of the film, with a cartoony title card that shows a raptor claw slashing /// through the Jurassic Park logo, it's apparent that this Jurassic Park does not take itself near as seriously as the first two do. The dinosaurs themselves have taken the leap from lifelike animals to movie monsters. With the exception of the raptors, all the dinosaurs are nothing more than movie monsters or eye candy. You won't hear any talk about maternal instincts here. But that's okay because at least Joe Johnston got the action right. Watching people run from dinosaurs can only be so much fun, but Johnston and company do a great job constructing some truly rousing set-pieces. There isn't much in the way of tension, but the action scenes have a great sense of scale and drama. Above all, it's fun, and that was the goal. Jurassic Park 3 feels like a theme park ride. A quick pre-ride set up, and then it's time to strap in for non-stop dinosaur action. There's no question that JP 3 is not on the same level as Spielberg's original two movies, but with good special effects, fun action, and a thankfully short run time, Jurassic Park 3 is good fun.68/100 "},{"Title":"Meh...","Date":"10 June 2015","Score":"14 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I can sum up my feelings about this movie in one word Meh.

Dr. Grant's character grew as a person right before our eyes, and the natural progression of his character would be to marry Dr. Ellie Sattler and have kids of their own.

In My opinion, Jurassic Park is probably one of the greatest films ever made; and while The Lost World Was not as good, It's still a great film in it's own right.  So when my friends told me that Jurassic Park 3 was a real letdown, I was shocked. What was so bad about Big Dinosaurs walking the landscape of a forbidden world? On top of, one of my favorite actors around was coming back into the fold. I have been a fan of Sam Neil since he was in the movie Dead Calm, and he was really cool in the first Jurassic Park. I was overjoyed when I heard that he was coming back in Jurassic Park 3. I told my friends that no matter what they said, I still will enjoy the movie for the sheer fact that I'm not expecting it to be better than the first movie, but I expect it to be fun film none the less. Of course they laughed at me and said that I was warned. So I then went to see it, and words really can't express the feelings I felt when I was watching this movie. This was a really bad film. I could not believe my eyes; they took everything that made the first two movies special and literally flushes it down the toilet.  Everything that could go wrong in a film went wrong in this film. The story is nothing more than a really bad joke. It's like they were making things up when they were going alone. This movie makes no sense what so ever, and it's not ashamed to even admit it. It's like the filmmakers did not care what they were making; they only cared about making a fast buck. The sad thing about it is the fact that the quality of this movie is so bad that it should have gone straight to video. The cast in general is not that good. Sam Neil is one of my favored actors but I do question his decision on even agreeing to come back to a movie that almost has no script. He is ok but his character has none of the flare or charm that made him so good in the first one. He comes a cross as a grumpy old man, and during the course of the movie, he becomes sort of annoying. At least Jeff Goldblum Made you laugh during the first two films, and at least kept his coolness. I think Sam knows that he sold himself and the franchise out by just taking the money, and it shows by his performance. Unfortunately, His performance is the best in the film, compared to William H Macy and Tea Leoni.  William H Macy Is another great actor, but like Sam; he phones in his performance. His character is suppose to be the comic relief of the film but just ends up more like an idiot.  Tea Leoni is another good actor stuck in a really bad part.  She just comes a cross as a mother with no common senses what so ever. I don't know about the special effects but it really does not hold a candle to the first two movies. It supposed to have more effects shots than the others but it in my opinion, it did not. The Spinosauris is really nothing to brag about, and does not have the menace or the presence of the T-rex's. The only decent scene in the whole movie is the bird cage scene, and that alone can't save this movie. The ending is down right disturbing, because there is really no end. It just came to a stop with no explanation what so ever. It's offensive because it does not have a climax and judging by the lack of story anyway, it's clear that the film makers just ran out of ideas.While The Lost World Did not have some of the magic of the original, it still retains its sense of wonder, and it was fun and scary. Jurassic Park 3 is neither of those things, it's more of a big screen version of a Saturday morning cartoon; and a bad one to boot. To sum it up, it's one of the worst films I have seen in a very long time. It's a real shame because I really loved the first two Jurassic Park movies but this one is just too ridiculous to even take seriously.  It's not even a real sequel; it's just a sad excuse to make money.  If this is the future of the series, then they just turned off another fan from seeing the next one.

Let's see...the plane's wings get torn off, the plane hits a tree, the dinos attack the plane.  Does anyone get killed?  Well, no, the pilot gets eaten, but the plane crash seems to affect utterly no one.2) Everyone's favorite carnivore, the T-Rex, has only a cameo in this movie.  (I guess the T-Rex must have a better agent than the raptors.)  In his place is Spinosaurus, aka The one with the fin.  Spinosaurus wasn't on InGen's lists, we learn in this movie.  So how the heck did it get here? The timeline in the JP movies could be anywhere from 10 years to fifteen, there's simply no way a new life form could evolve in that short amount of time. This was a plot development that went nowhere.  I was waiting to hear that InGen was developing 'military' dinosaurs for third-world military use; that there was some sort of black-ops project, SOMETHING interesting to explain why Mr. Fin took the Head Baddie spot away from the T-Rex.  I would've settled for a geneticist at InGen designing it on his own, 'under the table'.  (After all, if *I* knew how to make dinosaurs, I'd probably whip up a few super-carnivores myself.)  A possible subplot (perhaps have some Third World baddies who contracted with InGen for their very own Spinosaur and are now trying to get it, for example, at the same time Our Heroes are looking for their boy) could've been made here.  How did the Spinosaur get there?  Was it a 'black-ops' dinosaur deliberately designed by InGen to eat soldiers?  Was it a 'private' project gone horribly wrong? Was it working for a pizza delivery service?  We don't know, it just gets dropped.3) The aforementioned Spinosaur apparently came equipped with its own copy of the script and cloaking technology that the Air Force would envy -- he manages to get from here to there without being seen or heard by the humans (difficult indeed for a creature 70 lbs + and God only knows how many tons) and tracks them down very efficiently.  Even when he's eaten the annoying cell phone.4) The raptors have gone from a Lord-of-the-Flies mentality to a rather high moral stance.  When the humans give them back the raptor eggs, they simply take them and after hearing Sam Neill attempt to speak with his handy-dandy raptor-voicing-chamber, they let them live.  Apparently the raptors have been flipping through old copies of 'The Rights of Man'.  Um, no.  What was scary about the raptors from the get-go was their human-level intelligence combined with their complete LACK of human-style morality. Plus, some continuity issues here -- if they couldn't talk in the first two movies, how is it they've developed a whole language of their own now.5) The kid is awfully well nourished for someone who's been spending eight weeks on an island surrounded by killer T-rex's (and Mr. Fin, of course), raptors, and untold small predators.  He arms himself with 10-to-15 year old gas-grenades which work fine, apparently.  I'm sorry, that kid would've been eaten within a few hours in reality.

Now this would have worked if there were more to the story than that but unfortunately there is not, and it does not even try to be anything other than that. The whole discussion about The danger of playing god is tossed out for a run in the mill monster movie that has no brains or heart. Sam Neil is a very good actor but his character reminds us on why Jeff Goldblum character is so important to the series. One hint, Goldblum's character had brains, and a sense of humor. Sam Neil's Character has nether. If he did, he would have had the parents of the missing kid checked out before he agreed to go with them on the island. The parents of the missing kid are in fact so dumb, and so annoying that you end up wishing that they would be eaten by the dinosaurs, as for the screen writers and the director of the abomination of a film. There is barely any mention of the first two films, and the story does not even make any lead way into trying to connect it's self to those movies.  It does not even make sense in some aspects of the story, like how the Spinosauris even got on the island in the first place. It was not in The Lost World, so why is it in this one? At The End Of The Lost World, The military was surrounding the island because they did not want the Dinosaurs to go to the mainland, so where aren't they surrounding the island now? All of this and the quality of it make this the most pointless and useless film of this series. It seems like the makers of this film did not even try to make a good film, they just expected people to just swallow it, with out thinking on what they were seeing.  That is a really sad because it taints the magic of the extremely better first two movies.My advice Rent The first Two Films film of this series instead of wasting your time with this one.P.S. As for the whole Debate on which was a better sequel (Jurassic Park 3 or The Lost World) While The Lost World was not as amazing as the original, It still upheld the quality and substance.

There was everything to expect in the typical JP movie victims with awfully good endurance, a jungle, and some scary dinosaurs.Truthfully, it felt as if I were watching a different sequel to the original, not a second. The premise was pretty much the same a survivor of the Jurassic Park incident is forced to return to the island, and when all communication is cut by unfortunate circumstances, it's time to run around like crazy, trying to find a way off the island while escaping vicious dinosaurs at the same time. This time, we get to watch Sam Neill squirm instead of Jeff Goldblum, and instead of doing research, they're looking for a twelve-year-old kid. Not exactly the smartest move, but all is forgiven and forgotten when the dinosaurs are unleashed once more.If you're expecting something original and spectacular, then you're going to be disappointed. If you're like me, who only expects to see a fun-filled chase through the jungle for an hour or so, then sit back and relax.

This tradition goes back as far as Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan novels (Mr. Burroughs also wrote the original Lost World, interestingly), can be seen in more recent series like Jaws, and makes it's presence known in the modern day with the seemingly endless Saw movies.Jurassic Park III does not break from this tired and true money making ideal, but in it's defense it does aim a little higher than many of its fellow putrid III movies. Sam Neilson returning to his role as Alan Grant is definitely a treat, and most of the other actors in the film do a fair job at their respective rolls as well. As is expected from the franchise, the dinosaur CGI looks fantastic (though it still lacks that certain edge that T-Rex scene in the first movie had. Fellow fans will know what I'm talking about,) and there are plentiful scares to be had from the dinosaur islands more voracious inhabitants. Unfortunately however, this is where the good of the movie ends, and the bad starts to begin.The film opens with a man and a young boy going para sailing (at least I think that's what it's called. It involves a boat, a rope, and a glider, so forgive me if I called it wrong) over a beautiful sea with a tropical island in the backdrop. Can you guess where this is going? Yep, that island is none other than Isla Sorna, Site B itself. What this guy is doing taking his son para sailing next to one of the most dangerous islands on earth is beyond me, and it's one of the weak points in the plot. Which is bad, considering its the frigging OPENING of the plot. As you might expect, something goes wrong, the father and son crash on the island, and the game is afoot.To sum up the following events for you, the boys mother and divorced former father hire Alan Grant, under the fake pretext that they're owners of a major corporation just wanting to go on a tour of Dinoland, to be their guide of the islands habitat (so they can find their lost son.) Alan takes his ward with him, I don't even remember his name (you won't either) and before long the whole bunch is on a flight into the bowels of hell itself. Needless to say, things go the way of a T-Rex turd pretty much after the plane lands on the islands moss covered runway, with half the professional mercenaries hired with them dead in ten minutes and everyone is running for their lives. Major Spoilers! While the things mentioned above aren't exactly terrible (if not uncreative), than heres a quick list of the things that AREThe kid is found alive, after being alone on the island for weeks, without even a sign of psychological damage no less (I know I'd start to go a bit batty if I was alone in a jungle full of murderous reptiles.) Way to be realistic there, Mr. Spielberg. On top of that, the ordeal of fearing for their sons life brings the divorced parents back together (cheese. Alans ward is carried away by a murderous tyranodon and is found alive with only a few cuts at the end of the film (super cheese). And to top it off, the marines and half the navy come in just to save the little group right at the end (uber cheese.) The murderous nature that made the velociraptors movie staples in the last two films is pretty has the edge filed down in this film, all in a almost-corny effort to make them seem smart. Like Lost World, which tried to promote the idea of dinosaurs being caring parents at the films expense, this film tries to push the idea that raptors were geniuses in dinosaur terms (they weren't, by the way. Most raptors weren't much smarter than a wolf.) The end result is just an unfair robbing of what made the raptors scary in the first place. That cold, merciless nature of theirs.JPIII is a competent film, and you can see there were a few good ideas thrown in, but in the end, without any inspiration from one of Crichton's actual novels, the story falls flat. It's nice to see some flying Dino's and the Spinosaur is a competent villain (though not nearly as scary as Rex,) but other than that, I really wouldn't recommend this film as a must see. If your a major dinosaur fan, go ahead. For anyone else, rent, don't buy.

This movie was a huge disappointment. I was only ten when I first saw this film, and even then I saw the major flaws in the movie.Firstly, WHY did the Spinosaurus kill the all-time classic character, the Tyranosaurus Rex? From that point on, I knew that this movie wasn't going to be anywhere near as good as the previous two movies. Then, I saw how hollow the plot was. Compared to Jurassic Park or even The Lost World, this movie seemed to have virtually nothing to it but surviving the dinosaurs. Couldn't they have gotten even a LITTLE creative? When I saw the film, I was expecting at least a little more blood shed. There were how many deaths? Five? And four of them were right in the beginning of the film! After that, there was nothing left to see except for to wait for Udesky to get killed. And did anyone else notice that having Billy actually survive the end of the film seemed very familiarly close to the ending of that all-time dud of a film Jaws the Revenge? There were several good points to the movie, though. Bringing the family closer and all that good stuff was okay, and doing more with the intelligence of the Velociraptors was a good idea.I said in my comments for both of the other Jurassic Park movies that CGI characters these days are nowhere near as good as they were for the original Jurassic Park and its first sequel, and here is a good example of what I meant. During the fight with the T-Rex, you can especially see the poor computer graphics in this movie.I am glad that these writers brought in the Pteranodons in the series at last. They had been in the original book, but you only got a glimpse of them in The Lost World.To be honest, this film still wasn't God-awful, but I have a feeling that Jurassic Park IV won't be much worth watching.

A boy gets stuck on Isla Sorna (site B, where Dinosaurs were bred), which has since been abandoned by the InGen corporation, and where Dinosaurs run rampant. The plot takes shape in the form of a basic rescue-mission, with some delicious twists added.The action wastes no time in getting kicked into high gear, remaining immune to any sort of extended sub-plots or scientific filler.There are a few new dinosaurs added to the mix, and some truly graphic deaths that will make your skin crawl with prehistoric anxiety. The acting is competent, and does not detract from the high-octane story. There are some memorable discussions and one-liners, including Dr. Grant taking a well-deserved shot at Dr. Malcolm's personality. Where it fails Some of the CG looks highly dated in 2016, and the opening scene, where the boy is paragliding, looks like something that a guest would be able to make at a poorly executed green screen attraction at Universal Studios.In the end, it didn't further the narrative the previous two movies built. So if the positives outweigh the negatives, why did it receive such a poisonous reaction in 2001? I can only venture to guess that at the time, audiences felt it didn't measure up to the high standards set by Jurassic Park or even The Lost World. This may be true, but it still holds up as a solid film, worthy of 90 minutes of your life.

But that is all that's left of the legacy, flirts with what was. This is a monster flick; people get into a situation (whether it be dinosaurs or zombies) and then spend the rest of the movie being chased through action sequences 'til the end. And of course they had to invent an even bigger and badder baddie than the previous T-rex.The only thing teasing your imagination in this one is whether there's gonna be something remotely original (the answer unfortunately is no). They make the same mistake as so many other movies in the genre, focus is on the monsters and on action shots. Characters remain shallow and story oh so thin. This just doesn't make you buy into the emotions along the ride. Another mistake is killing of to many of the side characters in the start of the movie (the mercenaries). They could have added an interesting dimension.So, this turns out as a rather flat movie. The upsides are that Sam Neill and William H Macy has some charisma (however untapped in this one).

If you choose to ignore the previous facts attached to the JP universe, what this film offers you is a cheap, easy survival movie where the enemies are dinosaurs.In itself, the subject is interesting and cool, but the way they used it to form a plot was uninteresting and unoriginal a bunch of middle-class people being thrown in a dinosaur infested island looking for a kid.Now, if you have to compare it to the first 2 films of the franchise, it gets even worse. What first comes to my mind is the style of the movie and it's atmosphere in Jurassic Park and in its sequel, you had a change in mood that reflected to social situations explained in their respective films (JP1 was a movie about new technologies and showed the duality between great ambitions and critic regard of the consequences behind every action you decide to take, JP2 was about preserving what's left of the good side of your acts and interfering with those who did not yet achieve this state of consciousness) as opposed to this film, where stereotypes and rests of the first installments are brought up to screen without trying to satisfy the hunger for what made JP1 and 2 better films.In fact, they loosely followed the setting of these movies a rich man walk to Dr. Grant's digging site offering him a trip to a dinosaur island... and ends with Dr. Grant looking at birds (this time, it's those flying dinosaurs) trough an helicopter with a satisfied look on his face. But between those two parts, there's no food for thought, and if you defend it calling it a pure entertainment, let me call it a cheap one. As for the characters, they are merely shallow clones (!) of the ones they previously incarnated Grant is a bitter man who at some point in the film shows contempt on Ian Malcolm's preaching, yet the only 2 lines (with variations) of what he says throughout the movie are Don't do that and Ingen played god when they shouldn't have.Much of the magic that made JP1 a terrific film and JP2 an OK flick is gone as the only things I looked forward to by the first 20 minutes of the film was seeing as many humans being torn apart by dinosaurs as possible and in how many different ways. I was even disappointed by that, because Universal wanted the movie to be PG-13, so they could earn a few dollars more.And, as for a more formal analysis of the movie, the actors couldn't develop a good chemistry with each other, as they delivered their lines rather cheesily and perhaps undirected. The special effects were as good as usual, but less money in it, and more in efficient scriptwriters would have helped building a story without a book of Michael Crichton in the background. The dialogues were repetitive and unenjoyable, the realisation uninspired and the result, a LAME B-movie that should be categorized as a dinosaursploitation since I believe none other than a fan blinded by great expectations could enjoy it, and if it is not your case and you really want to take a look at it, download it prove with a small action that you won't pay for the crap (synonym censored here) they show you, no matter if the props man no.2 is starving on the streets or if Tea Leoni can't afford another plastic surgery/mansion (if you can't look beyond that last statement and plainly consider it at first degree, do yourself a favor and ignore it instead of showing how much an intolerant dinosaur you are -> addressed to intellectual rights self-righteous rats).I would like to describe with greater words what I think of Joe Johnston, but it wouldn't be allowed by IMDb's terms of use.

The movie only relies on loud sound effects, special effects, music, and only the money from the box office. Everything else is just garbage. Whats worse is that there were four screenwriters who couldn't come near the talent of screenwriter David Keop(Screen writer for Jurassic Park and The Lost World) and who couldn't finish the final production of the script when Jurassic Park 3 started filming. And to sum it all, there was the kid's film director Joe Johnston who thought in his foolish ways to make Jurassic Park 3 light, and to settle this as a kid's movie ruining everything great and imaginable from Steven Speilberg.The plot?  Two divorced parents rent a plane for a low flying tour over the dinosaur Island and invite Dr Alan Grant as their guide. Thats all there is to the plot. They go to the Island and a couple minutes later, people start running and getting eaten. Sorry to say, but thats all there is. Couldn't those four screenwriters come up with anything better? Come on, thats more like the idea from an 8 year old.Joe Johnston doesn't want to put any thought or time whatsoever in the movie development. Instead, he ignores the standards that Steven Speilberg has set up in the first Jurassic Park movies and does things his way. He ignores how Speilberg has done the action. Joe Johnston takes the action his way making the action quick, lacking build of suspense, and having the action last only up to 2 minutes. Spielberg on the other hand does the action right making it last more than 6 minutes and adding suspense.Johnston also enforces the new super dinosaur. Its a Spinosaurus to be exact. He can take out a plane in seconds, kill off a couple merchants, and take out a T.rex. He can't scare the audience. Johnston next enforces the new talking and smart raptors. Instead of frightening the audience as Johnston wants them to do, the raptors make the audience laugh out loud.There is also stupidity. Amanda Kirby calls for her son through a loud speaker phone during a desperate situation. Paul Kirby tries to get snacks from a broken down vending machine. Billy steals raptor eggs for funding. A satellite phone survives in a dinosaur digestive system and rings. There is just more stupidity I can list on and on.Everything is so predictable. Who didn't know what was going to happen next when Amanda gazed too long at the raptor head in the lab? Who didn't know who would live and who would die in the movie? Everything is so darn predictable. This movie had to have been set out for the weak minded audience.The only better acting is from Sam Neil and William Macy. Tea Leoni's acting was horrible. Jeter's and Nivola's parts were wasted. Morgan was just randomly chosen. And the other two were just there for dinosaur food. Thats all there is to the acting.And theres more. Not only have the four screenwriters come up with corny dialogue such as Into the herd, Into the trees, Your no better than the people who built this place, What was that?, and the Barney joke, they also got away with RIPPING off from the well thought of lines in the movie Aliens. This has been noticed by other critics so I thought of mentioning it to others here. They stole We must leave! We must leave now!, He's alive. I know he's alive and we're gonna find him, No matter what turns out...it wasn't your fault, It makes me wonder what else they were up to, You're alive...And thats the important thing, and I am so sorry you have to be here.The film running time is only 83 minutes. That is short enough for a kid's film. It also makes the film entirely weak for just relying on quick action and sound effects without a complete story line or development.The ending was just plain weak and stupid. We later find that JP3 is also a Dr Dolittle RIP-OFF where Dr Grant magically talks to the raptors. How absurd. The raptors soon leave without killing anyone. Next, the marines randomly appear and pick up the survivors. No new action in the end happened or was climatic as Johnston promised. Billy appears after having been thought to have died. The characters are horrible in the end. They don't care at all where the Pteranadons fly off to leaving room for another HORRIBLE Jurassic Park sequel.And thats about it. Jurassic Park 3 makes William Macy, Sam Neil, and Steven Spielberg look bad. Jurassic Park 3 only craves for quick action. It was put there only for the money. It messed up the entire JP series.

Upon seeing the velociraptors the herbivores begin stampeding and bumping into each other, but somehow neither trample the humans nor crush them between each other.The 12-year old child apparently survives eight weeks alone on the island having previously read a few books about dinosaurs (making him an expert on dinosaur hunting tactics) and later survives a pterodactyl attack and pursuit of it's young which were roughly the size of a 12-year old human, but with presumably better killing skills. Then when the 20-something model/paleontologist is attacked by 2-3 adult pterodactyls not only does he survive, but he is apparently able to swim far enough from the island to find US troops AND convince them to amass a small force to storm the beach to save the Dr and the delusional parents and spoiled child.Look out Plan 9 from Outerspace &#x96; your crown is being threatened.FWIW it's not a suspension of disbelief thing because I own over 400 movies many of which are scientifically improbable and some of which are scientifically impossible, but this movie is more outrageous than Angelina Jolie having the strength to fling a fired bullet faster than the earth spins (Wanted, if you don't get that reference).And before the fans of this movie jump on me I may have missed a few minor details that explain some of the things about which I'm complaining because I was working on a computer while 'watching' it, but I didn't miss enough details to take my 1 * rating to a 10.

Joe Johnston should be hunted down and shot for how he has handled this, the third instalment of the popular and highly successful Jurassic Park franchise, such is the degree of sheer incompetence shown in this near unwatchable creation.The Plot, Story, acting, characterisation and dialogue were never anything more than just plain awful. The action sequences were far too short and extremely unimaginative (most are inferior and blatantly obvious carbon copy's of what we saw in the first two instalments). None had any form of tension, build up or suspense worthy of mentioning, and from start to finish were about as intense and scary as your average episode of 'Tom and Jerry'. The death scenes were (yawn) plain to say the least, not to mention predictable, and on *all but one* occasion took place completely out of view. Its was painfully obvious they aiming towards the younger audiences this time around, the film even had Barney (the pink dinosaur) thrown in to boot.The Visual effects were nothing special either. Certainly NOT on par with what we saw in the first two `groundbreaking' instalments. Some of the CGI shots in particular (e.g. 'Brachiosaurs on the bank', and this goofy looking Red thing we see near the end) looked so cheap they could quite easily be confused with something that was done using clay models and 'stop-motion' techniques. Worse still was the animatronics. The way they moved, the way they acted, the way they were presented, they seemed generations behind what we saw in the first film and certainly the second. You knew instantly that you were watching a puppet with foam rubber for skin, the very second it appeared on the screen. Joe Johnston simply could not convince me that the puppets were real dinosaurs the way Spielberg did, and thus, throughout the film, the awe, the majesty and the belief that dinosaurs were alive on this distant island was totally lost.On a lighter note however, at least this films utter hideousness has allowed a great many people to see Steven Spielberg's 'The Lost World' for just how underrated it truly was.My final score - 1/10 (Just for the record, I gave both JP and TLW 9/10) "}{"Title":"An embarrassment to the entire Jurassic Park series","Date":"30 September 2001","Score":"7 out of 13 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  The only word that come in my mind when I think of Jurassic Park 3 is Why?

You realise just how brilliant Steven Spielberg is.Jurassic Park III is simply a pointless movie that never should have been made. The film simply reeks of a cheap sequel. The basic plot tells of a couple who tricks Dr. Alan Grant to take them into Jurassic Park after their son is lost on the island while parasailing. Predictably, all hell breaks loose as the dinosaurs continue to wreak havoc. Unfortunately, in all of this havoc there is not a single moment of decent dialogue, acting, directing, or special effects. The filmmakers seem to have interpreted the original Jurassic Park as a horror film, and treat this movie as such. Characters die in a timely and organised fashion, characters attempt to separate in order to be more effective, and so forth. The original Jurassic Park was not a horror film, and this movie should not have been treated as such.I doubt that many people had high expectations for Jurassic Park III as a good film. Most probably thought the movie would simply be an enjoyable escape for an hour and a half with great special effects and a few memorable scenes. Yet somehow, even with a budget of approximately ninety million dollars, the movie's special effects were terrible. In the opening scene, I heard a kid behind me who couldn't have been older than eight turn to his mom and say Mommy, that looks so fake. If the special effects couldn't even make a child believe, how are they supposed to convince the rest of the public? Another huge weakness in this movie is the timing. One thing that made the original Jurassic Park great was the memorable scenes. I can instantly recall great scenes from the movie, such as the T-Rex chasing the Jeep at night, the young boy climbing the electric fence and getting electrocuted, and so forth. Jurassic Park III doesn't have any sense of timing, and as a result the film just feels like a bunch of scenes that bleed into each other without any rhyme or reason. A few moments in the movie could have actually been memorable scenes had they been timed correctly, but instead they are easily discarded and thought of as a joke. The lack of special effects and memorable scenes kills the possibility of Jurassic Park III even being an enjoyable excursion.Yet through all the bad acting, poor writing, and mindless directing, the biggest weakness in the film is not as obvious. The filmmakers failed to realise what the original Jurassic Park was about. It was not simply a horror or action film in which the protagonists ran away from scary beasts. The film was an examination of man's role in nature and of how we view ourselves as the mighty rulers of the universe. While there were exciting chase scenes and great special effects, those were not the theme of the film. Jurassic Park III forgets all of this, and even occasionally mocks these themes in the original. If you took these themes away from the original film, all you would have had left would be a hollow horror film with great special effects. Jurassic Park III is simply a hollow horror film with mediocre special effects. Jurassic Park is a story about man; Jurassic Park III is a story about dinosaurs. That is the primary difference between the two films.One would have thought that with the budget and the resources the filmmakers had, they could have produced a better movie than Jurassic Park III. Instead, the movie is a reminder of Jaws, another amazing Spielberg film that had sequels made by different directors that were subsequently mindless waste. While Jurassic Park II was not a great film by any means, it at least understood the original and tried to carry on it's themes. Jurassic Park III does none of that, and as a result is simply rubbish that should definitely be avoided.

Who needs them?  Convincing dialogue that maybe, even vaguely resembles basic human speech and not that random stuff you get when you try to get your computer to say sentences?

I did not have the time to catch this in the theater when it was released but promised myself to see it when it hit video. So when my friends told me that Jurassic Park 3 was a real letdown, I was shocked. What was so bad about Big Dinosaurs walking the landscape of a forbidden world? On top of, one of my favorite actors around was coming back into the fold. I have been a fan of Sam Neil since he was in the movie Dead Calm, and he was really cool in the first Jurassic Park. I was overjoyed when I heard that he was coming back in Jurassic Park 3. I told my friends that no matter what they said, I still will enjoy the movie for the sheer fact that I'm not expecting it to be better than the first movie, but I expect it to be fun film none the less. Of course they laughed at me and said that I was warned. So I rented it, and words really can't express the feelings I felt when I was watching this movie. This was horrible.The cast in general is not that good. Sam Neil is one of my favored actors but I do question his decision on even agreeing to come back to a movie that almost has no script. He is ok but his character has none of the flare or charm that made him so good in the first one, and during the course of the movie, he becomes real annoying. Unfortunately, His performance is the best in the film, compared to William H Macy and Tea Leoni. William H Macy Is another great actor, but like Sam; he phones in his performance. His character is suppose to be the comic relief of the film but just ends up more like an idiot. Tea Leoni is another good actor stuck in a really bad part. She just comes a cross as a screaming idiotI don't know about the special effects but it really does not hold a candle to the first two movies. It supposed to have more effects shots than the others but it in my opinion, it did not. The Spinosauris is really nothing to brag about, and does not have the menace or the presence of the T-rex's. The only decent scene in the whole movie is the bird cage scene, and that alone can't save this movie. The ending is down right disturbing, because there is really no end. It just came to a stop with no explanation what so ever. It's offensive because it does not have a climax and judging by the lack of story anyway, it's clear that the film makers just ran out of ideas.To sum it up, it's one of the worst films I have seen in quite some time. It's a real shame because I really loved the first two Jurassic Park movies but this one is just too ridiculous to even take seriously. Judging By the word of mouth that Spielberg himself hated this film and wants the next movie to have nothing to do with it is a definite step in the right direction.

I will take third Jurassic Park III movie over Jurassic World! Just like a pure, fun, popcorn, Action Film, I will take this one. They brought Sam Neill back as Dr. Alan Grant back. The film was a rescue mission, it was fast paced and it was short than the second flick. I still love The Lost World Jurassic Park equal as the first flick Jurassic Park, but this flick grow on me and I love it and I have changed my mind. I love this flick I love it to death. I will rather watch this flick than forgettable Jurassic World! I love this flick to death and it is my third favorite film in the Jurassic park trilogy. As the first time I saw this film, I wasn't fan about it, but I keep watching it and I liked it, this movie grow on me. The film was fast paced, it went really fast around, it was an action film, it wasn't an epic adventure like was the first movie Jurassic Park (1993) it was actually an action flick an a rescue mission. Plot Adventure runs wild when renowned palentologist Dr. Alan Grant agrees to accompany a wealthy adventurer and his wife on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna, InGen's former breeding ground for prehistoric creatures. But when they're terrifyingly stranded, Dr. Grant discovers that his hosts are not what they seem, and the island's native inhabitants are smarter, faster, fiercer and more brutal than he ever imagined in this heart-stomping thriller.The film was directed by Joe Johnston who also directed The Rocketeer, I haven't seen that flick in ages yet, The Pagemaster, Jumanji and Captain America The First Avenger that I am fan of that film. After the success of Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Joe Johnston expressed interest in directing a sequel. Spielberg instead gave Joe Johnston permission to direct the third film in the series, if there were to be one. I don't think the director did a terrible job, I think that this movie more lacked on a script writers, so is not Joe Johnston fault for directing this film for using more CGI in the film.I love Sam Neil as Dr. Alan Grant and I love that he goes on an Island Isla Sorna, where man is up against dangerous predators in the ultimate battle for survival. This movie takes no prisoners and pulls no punches. It takes the idea of the original, puts an interesting twist into the plot, injects it with good FX, good acting and a decent budget, and you have something far superior to the original.I like all- new dinosaurs and the special effects CGI, more practical effects are in there, they did not bothered me or that it was directed from someone else and not Steven Spielberg himself. I like the CGI in this film.A wealthy couple with Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neil) land on a island Isla Sorna and all the mercenaries are killed off, I like that in the film that the mercenaries are killed off. This film is very quickly paced, is not boring film and it is not a dull movie, it does not drag a long, is very interesting to me and it is a good action film. Jurassic park III is MILES way better to me than Jurassic World, I will rather watch this film than the new one. The first time I reviewed this film I hated it, but now I loved it a lot.I am fine with the FX of the Spinosaurus, I like Spinosaurus, I thought it was pretty cool. Btw the kid in this movie wasn't annoying and I think he really did a good job, he was smart and recourses, he was useful in this movie, he survived that length of time by himself & saved Alan against Spinosaurus, so yea I like that and I like this film. I don't think it was terrible or forgettable at all. I really did not like that Laura Dern can't return with her character in a cameo scene, but still I liked that they made her a happy married woman with the kid and I still like that Alan and Ellie are still in contact together, that is decent in the film.

As a stand alone film, this third movie in the franchise was generally OK, though with it's shorter length and emphasis on action it was rather apparent that the film makers were relying on the success of the first two pictures to make a go of it with this one. The dinosaurs make their presence felt almost immediately, and there's an array of creatures either seen or mentioned that I'd never heard of before, like a 'suchomimus', a 'baryonyx' and a 'spinosaurus aegypticus', so if they appeared on screen, I'm no one the wiser. Actually the 'spinosaurus' had a descriptive enough name, so the walking dinosaur with a large fan on it's back was probably that one. Let's face it, with a franchise like this, the series can probably go on forever if the writers can get creative enough with it. For my part, when I'm looking for a little diversion I can count on a few stand-byes, among them martial arts flicks, Japanese monsters and the occasional dinosaur movie. If I want to think, I go for something else.

I don't recommend you watching it unless you must. The plot is awful, the characters are poorly written and it's too short. 90 minutes? Look at the first two movies. They were 160 minutes. The best part about this movie is Alan Grant, but he seemed to be bored when they were filming. Is like he didn't want to be in this movie. We also have Billy, a lame character who doesn't really do much. And there is the annoying family The Kirbys. Amanda Kirby was the worst character of the movie. No, even worse. Of the franchise. All she did was to scream BEN! ERIC. And of course, they introduced us to a new dinosaur the Spinosaurus, portrayed in an awkward animatronic and CGI. When I was a kid and I saw this dinosaur, I knew I wasn't going to like it. All it did was to chase Grant and the others. This movie was so unnecessary. We had TLW which is a great sequel and Universal wanted another one for some reason. Joe Johnston, the director of this movie, did a terrible job. I also like the fact that in a pod cast they actually said that it will be original. It was not. It was a cheap copy of The Lost World. Being a Jurassic Park fan, I wanted to like this movie. I watched 20 times,trying to figure out why I didn't like it. It's bad, that's why. A weak sequel. But hey, at least Jurassic World was a better movie and it didn't let the franchise end like this.

I loved the original and The Lost World, I did think Jurassic World was a bit disappointing but it was still a good movie. Jurassic Park III on the other hand is an embarrassment to this franchise. When I watch a movie I review it based on the acting, directing, cast, camera angles and the budget. If it weren't for this movie having the name Jurassic Park in it, I think Jurassic Park III would be considered one of the worst movies ever made. It isn't directed by Steven Spielberg it's directed by Joe Johnston who only has made one good movie which was October Sky. The main problem with this movie is that it seemed rushed and unfinished. The thing I loved about The Lost World is that Steven Spielberg tried to make it different than Jurassic Park, the problem with Jurassic Park III is that it's just trying to get Sam Neill back on the island and feels like a cheap version of the original. There are just so many moments where your thinking to yourself they actually put that in the movie or They thought that was a good idea?. The animatronics in this movie are bad too! It's crazy to me that a movie that came out in 1993 has better CGI and animatronics than the one that came out in 2001. Besides Sam Neill's character Alan Grant everybody in this movie is flat and boring and has no emotion whatsoever. It's 30 minutes shorter than Jurassic Park and The Lost World and there isn't even a main antagonist in this movie. A spinosaurus is on the poster of this movie so you would assume that they are being stalked by a spino right? No that thing appears like 3 times and just chases them into an area where they can hide from it. Alan Grant is also going crazy because he is obsessed with raptors or something, I don't know it's very unclear. There's a dream sequence on a plane where Alan sees a raptor sitting next to him and it says his name. That was one of those wtf moments in this film. Here is a quick fun fact before we wrap up, they started filming this movie before the script was finished. That explains a lot. This movie is truly terrible and if your thinking of buying the Jurassic Park trilogy on Blu Ray or something don't waste your money. Just buy Jurassic Park and The Lost World separately. This thing is one of the worst sequels ever made and one of the worst movies ever made. The final grade for Jurassic Park III is an F.

Remember that pulse-pounding opener that offered only the most minimal tease as to the carnage that would follow? Remember the long slow build up to the eventual unveiling of the Dinosaurs and sharing Dr Alan Grant's wonder at the first sighting? And the same adrenaline pumping thrill when the Rex first broke loose? Well I'm sorry to tell you that the same rapture is absent from the third instalment in the franchise, but on a second look this isn't so much of a hindrance as you might realise.The film makers this time around realise that offering us only the barest glimpses of Dinosaurs will not have the same effect anymore. We've already marvelled at the herds of Brachiosaurs marching before the sunset so now, we can get stuck right into the thick of the action without hesitation. As a consequence Jurassic Park 3 is considerably more light-hearted than it's predecessors (Sam Neil in particular seems to be having a blast playing Indiana Jones's reptile bothering cousin again) and if you approach it as such, it's a very enjoyable movie.There's no theme park backing or evil corporate agenda behind the plot as Dr Alan Grant is hired by the rather odd married couple the Kirbys (Tea Leoni and the ever watchable William H Macy) as a guide for a special Dinosaur spotting flight over Isla Sorna. And before you can say no secret hidden agenda here no sir the cast are once again running through jungle, screeching in fear for their lives as monstrous prehistoric beasts pursue them through the undergrowth. And here is where we're treated to the real stars of the show, the Dinosaurs themselves.T-Rex however plays a much smaller role passing the torch to the new king of the thunder lizards, the monstrous Spinosaurus. This may have rankled with some fans but the new addition to the menagerie makes for a remarkable creature a 60 foot predator with a snout filled with teeth and the kind of temper that'd put a pro tennis player to shame. The early clash between this new apex creature and the former tyrant lizard is one gob-smacking (but painfully brief) highlight and not even the rather silly Peter Pan-style gag involving it swallowing a mobile phone can ruin it.That aside, there are also plenty of fast-paced set pieces to keep the pace at a constant high. The raptors return once again and there's also another fresh menace in the shape of the Pteranodons; colossal winged reptiles that weren't actually dinosaurs but a whole other species entirely. The scene where the cast gets stuck in their massive aviary is a riot and if you've ever found yourself being pecked at by seagulls on Brighton pier, just imagine it but a thousand times worse and you'll get the idea.Not the gob-smacking brilliance of the original by a long shot but with the refreshingly daft approach, it's certainly better than The Lost World (which was to all extents and purposes a remake of Aliens but with Dinosaurs instead of extra-terrestrials). It does suffer from the lack of Jeff Goldblum and the non-climax is a big let down but as popcorn munchers go, there are far worse ways to spend an evening.

The characterizations were very well done. The suspense well done. You cared about who lived and who died. Spielberg/Crichton did a great job at presently a fantastic (read unbelievable) story as believable, part of which was an apparently plausible way of resurrecting dinosaurs. I guess we knew that the kids wouldn't die and Neil/Dern would probably live too, but even so the suspense scenes with the Raptors were remarkably well done. And everyone else was well done, so we cared to the very end.I didn't care so much for _JP2 Lost World._ Occasionally Spielberg loses self control and as he did the _The Temple of Doom_. Watchable. Just. Once.Spielberg is only billed as an Executive Producer on _Jurassic Park II_. Instead the reins are turned over to director Joe Johnston, who promptly rides the franchise off a cliff. Johnston's claim to fame is Jumanji. And it shows. This is Jumanji with Dinsoaurs. I know what Johnston was thinking, but what was Spielberg?Take the plane crash on the island. A shot of the plane falling towards the ground begins with a close-up of the passengers faces saying Wooooahhhh! through one end the ripped-open fuselage, pulling back as it falls vertically into the ground. Not a bruise! It was like a cartoon.Then when they stumble upon the Spinosaurus eating a carcass, Grant says Everyone be very still!. They all turn and run. And then Grant runs. The Spinosaurus chases them, but they outrun it, at that by first outrunning him across a grass plain!!! Again, a cartoon.Maybe Joe Johnston was trying to make this a light hearted comedy. But heck; *COME ON!* This is set on a remote Island with vicious reptiles with big sharp teeth. A Comedy? Nah. Comic relief? From what? The scenes which could be tense/dramatic *are* the comic relief. Johnston isn't funny. Not one bit.JP3 becomes a cartoon. Cartoon Characters are indestructible, so you don't have to worry about them. This completely killed the suspense. Some characters did die, but you knew who they were right from the moment you saw them. When you realized Tea Leoni/William Macy were parents, you knew they wouldn't die because that would upset the kid. It was that formula. When the boy came running out of the jungle, the audience isn't surprised. More like well, duh... Apparently the characters knew this too, because they walked brazenly without any concern about what might be creeping up on them, and talked loudly (and often shouted) as they went. Imagine how much better these scenes would have been if they darted though the undergrowth, whispering and looking over their shoulders as they went? That's pretty fundamental film making, but one Joe Johnston doesn't grasp.Presumably Joe Johnson thought he could make the Spinosaurus seem scary to us by having it kill the T-Rex at the beginning. Well, it didn't work. It didn't look scary and seemed pretty silly. Spielberg's T-Rex really did have screen presence; It's expression and actions were those of a bloody-thirst meat-hungry dinosaur. But Johnston's Spinosaurs looked and acted like an angry Turkey.The Raptors were lame. All they want is their eggs back. (I was waiting for the CE3K aliens to land and make hand signs to them.) The supporting cast was killed off within maybe half an hour, only leaving the characters you knew would live. You knew Nick wasn't going to die, so when he disappeared under the Pterodactyls, you knew he'd be back. (He was.) Besides, the characterizations really were crap. The bond between the boy and his parents is unconvincing. The boy and Grant together are like two people in an Elevator.I was glad to see Sam Neil and Laura Dern at the beginning, because I know good actors avoid sequels because they're often crap. I (incorrectly) surmised that because they were both here, it would be good. They must have tempted Neil with big bucks, but he risks B-grading himself here. Laura Dern's performance is a cameo.The script writers should be flayed too. It wandered aimlessly. Stuff that could have been developed like the raptors talking, the boy surviving or Ellie/Grant's relationship don't go anywhere. Even Leoni/Macey reconciling. These things go for 15 seconds of dialog. You're left expecting something to follow, but they never do. Plot holes and stupidity galore When Grant and the boy meet, instead of bringing the others to safety, they go back to the Boy's hideout and eat. There is a dream sequence with a talking dinosaur which just isn't funny. If you do something like that, at least make it funny! We are also expected to believe Grant and Nick were too stupid to make sure the check didn't bounce before agreeing to the trip. There's more, but you get the idea...The ending, thirty Marines suddenly making a beach landing (heard of helo recon guys?) is just dumb.I say (half in Jest) maybe Johnston could have saved his movie if he'd cast Robin Williams in Sam Neil's part. I understand Kennedy/Spielberg are putting together a JP4. Here's a warning Audiences can get sucked into seeing a bad film by well-crafted publicity, but when they see a bad film they bank it and you end up paying for it next time.

Jurassic Park III was the biggest disappointment of the summer of 2001. The trailer looked great but the movie is not. It is easily the worst of the three films. This movie lacks the excitement that the first two had. It doesn't really start moving till the end. The scene which it starts is the Pteranodon scene, which was very exciting. However, thats about the only standout action scene. The others are very poorly done. Well actually the first scene of the movie with the fog is kind of creepy.  The Special Effects are still impressive but they are losing their freshness. They were eye popping in the first two movies but there just good here. There is actually one scene where the effects look sort of fake.These movies have never been actor movies, the dinosaurs mostly overshadow the actors. But the acting was still a little better than ok. Here, Sam Neill is flat. Laura Dern has barely any screentime. Tea Leoni is very out of place. William H.

As well as dazzling the eye and quickening the pulse, it inspired the imagination.'Jurassic Park III' marks the first movie where the studio takes the JP license and runs with it. Anyone that read Crichton's book could say that 'The Lost World' was actually the first, but here we seem to have a real attempt to turn a once fresh, serious, event movie into a routine franchise. It's a surreal cringe to think that 'Jurassic Park' might be another 'Friday the 13th style series of endless sequels - each one more rehashed than the last.  I'm glad there's a 'Jurassic Park 4' in the works because someone needs to pump this series with new life - and fast.Not that 'Jurassic Park III' is a total failure by itself. It's just that when a series starts out with an idea as innovative as 'Jurassic Park' I don't know how any subsequent movie could improve or inject something new into it. JP3 takes the simple way out. It toes the Hollywood line of thought that people only go to these movies to see people running from, screaming at and being eaten by dinosaurs. Ok, that is some of the fun... but director Joe Johnston simply settles for being a late night B-movie amusement instead of instilling any suspense and excitement into the proceedings.It's hard to really fault Johnston for the film's ineffectiveness. The talented director of 'The Rocketter', 'Jumanji' and 'October Sky', this is an example of a complete studio mismatch between director and material. This same awkward marriage of independent talent and big Hollywood production goes for writers-for-hire Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor as well. Apparently, when your previous films are as brilliant and daring as 'Election' (and the Laura Dern movie 'Citizen Ruth') you get a shot with a 'Jurassic Park' movie. Despite their considerable talent in other generas, nobody behind the camera here is in their element. Still, in their element or not, a monkey could have come up with a better catalyst for the plot then a goofy hang-gliding accident. Oops.As for the story itself. When the original movie came out it was like a wet dream for video game designers who now had a ready-made license to put people and dinosaurs together without any brain strain. What came out of it was a subsequent game for the Sega Genesis called 'Jurassic Park Rampage Edition' featuring scenes from Crichton's original novel, like a pterodactyl fight and a ride down the river rapids, not included in the movie. 'Jurassic Park 3' is like the movie translation of that game. It's like the 'lost scenes' from the original. There should be a DVD feature where you can meld the two and form the ultimate Jurassic Park ride. Also like the game, the movie doesn't really end as much as it just stops cold in it's tracks and starts ushering people - dazzed and bewildered - out of the theater. The scenes themselves are pretty spectacular in their execution and it's nice to see them come to life. Along with that, the vibrant color palette, some remarkably detailed special effects and well sprinkled doses of humor here and there elevate the movie above its mindless script to being likeable, watchable fun. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni look embarrassed, but it's great seeing the unflappable Sam Neil (and Grant's trusty hat) back in action.

With only a handful of characters, there's not much suspense about who's going to get it, nor any big surprises in how that happens. A lower budget might lead to more thoughtful marshaling, but not as far as the characters are concerned. The actors playing Billy and Erik annoy tremendously, while the late Michael Jeter, playing the leader of a trio of dim mercenaries, does not stick around nearly long enough. In a film as sparsely populated as a Beckett play, such poor resource management is hard to overlook. We get plenty of CGI, but nothing we haven't seen, except a couple of new dinosaurs who roar and snap their teeth pro forma. Show me something new. Billy's fate feels like the result of a quick tack-on after a poor initial audience screening, and his out-of-the-blue paragliding exploits stretch the conventions of even this series (where 10,000-volt fences have been known to barely muss the overtended coiffures of young boys.)Though directed by Joe Johnston, this remains Steven Speilberg's baby, which means you can count on a few things. The woman will make it through alive, the hero will make witty asides while wearing a rain-soaked fedora, and the kid will show spunk and enterprise well beyond his years (seeing Erik suddenly show up in his shrubbery costume was the single biggest groan in a movie full of them. Of course the movie's for kids, but do they have to rub it in?) Amazingly, violating Speilberg's no-guns provision in which no character can accomplish anything positive with a loaded weapon not pointed at a German, one pistol does manage to come in handy. It's a flare gun, but a welcome change of pace still.I liked Sam Neill a lot, and found myself enjoying William H. Macy and Tea Leoni's portrayal of the unhappy couple despite myself. Leoni deserves a better career than she's had. I'm not sure whether the film is sending up their yuppie self-absorbtion or celebrating it (three or four dead people and a crashed plane is a hell of a bill for relationship counseling, wouldn't you say?) but I'll say the former and enjoy it for what it is. The action sequences are reportedly rejected storyboarding from the first movie, but work surprisingly well for second-hand cobblings, not thrilling so much as effective in moving the plot along quickly. JP3 is not a good film, it's not even fair, but there's intelligence and talent behind it all the same.Ultimately, the fault here is not one of a director's lack of vision, or writer's block. It's that the third time around the Park, the wonder of dinosaur-gazing seems gone, and much of the film has a tired, put-upon feeling, like We're here because you want us here, not because we want to be here. They say we're due for Jurassic IV in 2005, but I for one would gladly vote them off the island if they gave me the chance.

That one was directed by Steven Spielberg and it was, to say it in one word, Amasing. It was a landmark in film history.Since that one did as well as it did at the box office and it was also well recived(won three oscars)it was given that a sequel had to be done. And it was, in 1997 The Lost World Jurassic Park came out. It, also did amazingly good at the box office though was not near as criticly acclaimed as the first one(it did accualy receive one oscar nomination for best sound).And in 2001 we all went to see the third installment in the series. Jurassic Park 3.This film starts with Eric Kirby and Ben Hildebrand going parasailing near Isla Sorna(Site-B). But, when they are in mid air a Dinosaur attacks the boat underneath and they are helpless. They manage to cut themselfs free, but only to glide in over the dino filled island...Dr. Grant(Sam Neil) is still in paleontolegy. He is trying to raise fundings to his projects, but without any biggers successes. Then one day Amanda and Paul Kirby(Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) contacts him. They give him and offer to come with them as their guide when they are going to fly over Isla Sorna. since they offer him a fat pay check he gomes a long, with him comes Billy Brennan, his partner. Once they are flying over the island they land the plane, someting Alan does not like.After that it all goes to hell. People dies and all hell breaks lose. Alan also finds out that Eric is Amandas and Pauls son.So, what did I like about this film? The acting from Sam Neil and William H. Macy was very good. Teo Leoni on the other hand;no. Alessandro Nivola did ok as well, the same with Trevor Morgan and Michael Jeter, but those who stood out were Macy and Neil.I like the story. They go back to the 'civilians trapped on the island' concept, with I think is way better that what they had in The Lost World('militarys trapped on island').This one is directed by Jeo Johnston, the man behind Jumaji and October Sky. I think that some people think that this one is not as good as the first two only because Steven Spielberg not directd it. Joe Johnston has done a good job directing this one in my opinion.What bothered me? The script. It sucked. Some bad dialouge. They were doing rewrites on the set, and it was not a writter who did it, it was the actors(Macy and Neil). That is NOT supposed to happen.(They also started to shot without a complete script). There is to MUCH action in this one, it starts off right away. In JP1 they spend like 40 m to build up the characters and then the action kicks off. In this, BAMM, like that. We do know Sams character from the first one but there are several other new ones that we know nothing about.This film is also way to short(81 m) for that much action. It is like the writers have only one thought in their heads, and that is action, action and action. Sure, a film like this needs action, the first one had it and the second one had alots off it. But this one is only 83 minutes long and it has like 7 or 8 action sequenses.I did like the dino fight. really cool. it looks so real. The 'bird cage' sequence is also pretty good but then the other ones are, well, not that good.And the raptors in this one are smart. Yes, smart. Smarter than primates. Ok. Maybe they were, I'm no expert or nothing but in this film they set trappes for the persons. They talk to eachother. call for help. Gimme a break!And there is one weird thing in this film, and the endSPOILERS when the guy stands on the beach. Why the heck is he standing there? Why? Maybe it is supposed to be funny, I don't know. And the a second later there are marines on the beach and helicopters in the air. Later when they fly off the island we also see ships, three of them if I am not mistaken. Now How the **** does Elle Sattler, a nobody, manage to call the military and convinse them to go there to save Alan and the others? Not only that, earlier in the film, Paul Kirby say that the embassy had told them to 'forget it' or something like that. Then, the marines are AMERICAN, pretty fast americans too. They manage, in only a few hours, to assemble the soldiers, send out the ships and sail to the island. Not that likley to me.So in concluding, it is an OK sequel to an OK sequel to a masterpiece. Good acting, great dinoes -- bad script and pretty lame ending.6.5/10  "},{"Title":"Exactly What You Expect","Date":"7 May 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  JP-III delivers exactly what you would expect.

To be honest, when the film ended, I felt a little robbed by the lack of a 'Jerry Springers Final Thought'.Summing up, I can't help but remember a scene in which Erik holds up a huge jar of T- Rex pee.

This is better than the Lost World but not as good as the original. Although I don't think anything could top the original. The Tea leoni character is annoying sometimes, but not as bad as the kids in the first JP. My only minor complaint about the movie is that some things are too conveniently placed. Without revealing too much, there is a scene that features characters running along the side of a fence while being chased by a dinosaur, the thing is that about 60 feet down the fence is a convenient opening for them to slip through before the dino catches up.

Technology at it's highest, Jurassic Park emphasized a thrill ride of a story with visual effects that were beyond impressive. It's sequel The Lost World was obviously a step down from the first with the impressive special effects against the weak backdrop of a story, and a ridiculous ending that had movie audiences wanting less. This time, Jurassic Park III, is essentially different from the first two. Sans the Spielberg touch, Jurassic Park III is a B-movie that has essentially dropped the dreadful exposition that we knew all too well in the first and even the second one. This time drawing on good old fashioned suspense with our troubled heroes on the run, and introducing new creatures. Part 3 is in fact, better than the second one, especially the ridiculous climax from the sequel, but not all that much better. The predictibility factor reaches an all time high in this one, which could barely be found in the first two films. There is less human carnage and more suspense jacked up. But there are fewer and more subtle surprises that be found in this. And I only have one thing to say about the dinosaurs There's only so many times you can see another velociraptor snarling and fighting before it becomes tedious. It's obvious that part 3 could never match up to the magic of the first one, because it was all about timing, and in today's post-Titanic, special effects driven films, Jurassic Park III is just another entry that is nothing more than good old fashioned entertainment, short that it is. If you go in expecting something like the original, save your money. But if you just want a straight through action adventure, then see Jurassic Park III. On a neutral note, there are rumors circulating that Spielberg is interested in making a Jurassic Park IV.

It does fail in the department of character development, and the ending is really too abrupt, but this movie is such a relief from the second one that I hardly cared about its shortcomings.  For a third installment, JP3 isn't half as bad as it could be--  It could have even been great with just a little tweaking.   They need to return to those dinos the same sort of quirky behavior and personality they had in the first one, and spend a little more time on dialogue between the characters and maybe a little less on thrill effects... Comparing 3 to 1, there is a glaring difference in that the original JP spent a lot more energy building up the story and the people in it, while 3 spends too much on chases and escapes.  There is also a dislike factor of two of its characters (This married couple which is pretty uninteresting) which leaves Dr. Grant and the Kid to carry the whole thing-- they need to throw in a little more People Action, keeping in mind that The Human Zoo can be just as interesting as the prehistoric one, and complement it to a very positive end.  It's also becoming *necessary* in this age when computer-produced creatures don't draw the wow that they used to.   Still, #3 is a vast improvement over #2 and that's worth commendation.  I'm all set for JP4--  It's sounding pretty good and here's hoping they can get Neill and Goldblum together again.

It's just to provide a prolonged, Oh dear! The dinosaurs are attacking! How great is our peril! Excuse me, animals don't act like that. A shark might bite a surfer once, but once it tastes fiberglass -- even though it also tasted blood -- Not food registers in its teenie weenie brain and it goes off and looks for some seals or fish. But JPIII's predators keep chomping on an airplane fusillage, and a boat, without once getting a taste of food. And they persist and persist and persist. Even making the bizarre plot assumption that they were being genetically engineered to attack anything that might have people in it, these critters would have long since died out from having spent all their time trying to eat empty jeeps.Then we have the party startle a T-rex munching down on his prey. The T-rex then abandons his prey half-eaten to go chase the teenie humans. Again, animals don't act like this. They'll do something to scare off the people, which they perceive as scavengers after their dinner, then go right back to dining.Then we have the mega-dinosaur that evidently preys on T-rexes. Why go after prey with big teeth when you have a nice fresh carcas right nearby that T-rex is abandoning?The behavior of the people is even more bizarre and inexplicable.So if you like R.L.

The original Jurassic Park is naturally an unbeatable classic that started the whole Dinosaur hysteria. I enjoyed JP2 too, but the final of that movie was a real letdown.

This is how Johnston, cast and crew made their way through a 100 million dollar motion picture. But I don't need to tell you any of this. Whether you've heard the news or not, it'll all become patently obvious if and when you cross paths with this action-smart, story-stupid sequel.Like the wrecked buildings and ravaged genetic laboratories that Dr. Alan Grant visits when he finds himself stranded on an island of dinosaurs, the third Jurassic effort stands as only a hollowed, corpse-like reminder of the original, raided of all back-plot and substance. Where there were once potent ethical implications, there is now action. Where there was once social commentary, there is now action. But who's to blame here? Where else could Johnston have gone with this relatively exhausted ongoing storyline? The industry executive setup We've got a huge market for an island full of dinosaurs, but no rational or convincing reason as to why any character would end up there. The industry executive solution We don't need a reason. Lighten up. Have fun. If you're smiling, then we aren't technically stealing your money.But perhaps this is all overburdening the issue. Sam Neil does do a good job of re-hashing lines that read like water-doused kindling; We probably won't get off this island alive, This is playing God, you know the drill. Any issues his dramatic, monotone dialogue addresses were dually covered (and then some) in the original. Neil also does a good job of totting around his quick-tongued, dim-witted posse of fools, including William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, who play the divorced parents of a boy caught alone on the island after a parasailing accident leaves him stranded. Psssst there's your plot.The fact of the matter is, Johnston knew he had no outs. With no capacity for further originality or expansion, Jurassic Park 3 could only solidly capitalize off of one thing. Give the people what they want, feed them their own tails when there is no tale to tell. And action is what you'll get. The fast paced, digitally perfected sequences rarely let up, growing in intensity and sheer aesthetic believability as the movie progresses. Jurassic hasn't gone CG like Star Wars. You won't find outlandish, graphically animated figures of The Mummy variety. These dinos look as real as they ever have, but show up throughout a lot more of this picture. With full-sized, animatronic models that weighed up to 5,000 lbs, moved limbs at speeds of 100 mph, and could pick up 5G's of force per movement, the dinos were more present than the actors in the majority of scenes. And this is only fitting.Perhaps Johnston would have made a bigger mistake had he actually tried to insert an innovative plot or theme or group of memorable characters into this feature. He cut a lot of the fatty sequel excess - protracted melodrama, bunk character bonding, and distended revelations - for a much more streamlined, action-stocked vehicle. Although the film's overall visual rendering is more drab and much darker than the former two, the (at times) humorous one-liners and on-going comedic bits (for instance, a ringing cell-phone in a Spinosaurus' belly) contrast well with the heavy effects, and give the movie the feel of a genuine, old-school popcorn flick.Does this make scriptless direction, storyless action, and the abandonment of all formerly pertinent themes and social issues an acceptable solution? Jurassic Park 3 may have bite, but unlike the original, it gives you nothing to chew on.

With a run time of barely 90 minutes, the tiniest of plots and an almost smaller cast group, I could hardly think of a more appropriate description.In all honesty though, taking a compact approach to this film was probably a better idea rather than producing another overblown, over-long effort like The Lost World.Let's face it, these films are never going to be oscar winners (except maybe for technical awards). They are just meant to provide sheer thrills and cheap, unchallenging entertainment. Without any meatier content, the best way to provide this is to keep it short and sweet and get us out of the cinema before the monotony of rampaging dinosaurs sets in.Jurassic Park 3, in a nutshell kicks off with Sam Neill's character from the first film heading back onto another dinosaur island with assistant Alesandro Nivola and ex-couple Tea Leoni and William H. Macy. The latter grouping's young son has been stranded on the island for 8 weeks after a hang-gliding accident and for some reason they believe he can survive this long against mobs of man-eaters. With a bit of coaxing, our resident dino-duo end up joining them.This is where plotting ends. It doesn't take long for everything to go sour and before you know it everyone is alone in the jungle with more lurking predators than Arnie would ever be likely to face. From here on there are more loud shocks and close calls than you could imagine, with a large array of old faves and new dinos slicing and dicing from every direction.These setups are always what make the Jurassic Park films, and because this one keeps it so compact, these moments aren't spoilt by unnecessary plotting, grandiose speeches or techno babble. All we are left with is the sweet dessert minus the distraction of the main course.In terms of cast, the four above-mentioned big names aren't really necessary, although they do have a pile of fun running around screaming and doing their best to attract dinosaurs. Everyone else is (unsurprisingly) dinosaur fodder and usually disposed of in inventive manners. What more could you ask for??On the down side, there is some sensationally dismal dialogue (you're just as bad as the people who made these dinosaurs) and the effects, although not terrible, don't have the same awe-inspiring quality as the same film.Still, as far as blockbusters go, Jurassic Park 3, thanks to its compact production style, generally hits the spot in entertainment value. The conclusion seems to hint that more is to come too. I guess the producers don't believe that the compact idea that  worked so well here applies to the rest of the series. Time will tell I guess.7/10 "},{"Title":"Next time around, the script will be even stupider, and the raptors will be composing violin sonatas","Date":"17 June 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  When a film lacks the courage to play the RIGHT plot development, opting instead to give the audience what it wants, this is a bad, but forgivable.  What's unforgivable is when a film lacks the courage to play the right plot development and opts instead to give the audience what it DOESN'T want.  That's what happens here.  (At least, that's what happens unless I have an unrealistically high opinion of popular taste, which, admittedly, isn't hard.)  When the two adventurers reveal that the real reason they've kidnapped Dr. Grant and risked their damn fool necks is that they're looking for their missing son, whom they're SURE is still alive, even though any reasonable person would realise that (a) he must be dead by now, and (b) even if he isn't dead by now, the attempt to rescue him would almost certainly prove futile ... well, surely any audience with blood flowing through its veins will be longing for the parents to be proved wrong, for the rescue party to fail to find any evidence that the child is alive or to find irrefutable evidence that he is dead (either would do), and for the two selfish, idiotic violators of international law to return from the island sadder but wiser ... but, of course, we can sense that the narrative is being driven by autopilot from one cliché to the next, and that this won't happen.  And indeed it doesn't.  The boy is alive and he is rescued.  (Three men die in order to save the life of this one boy, but Amanda and Paul see no need to worry about that, because, hey, they're other people's sons.)I'm not sure that this miserably stupid film (rule of thumb the intelligence of a Jurassic Park movie varies inversely with the depicted intelligence of its raptors) is any more ludicrous than its predecessor; its basic story is, if anything, better motivated.  But make no mistake it's far worse.  In The Lost World, Spielberg seemed to be going through the motions, shooting a script that bored him, and even so he brought the story to life in a way that Johnston could only dream of doing.  To see Jurassic II and then Jurassic III is to understand the difference between rubbish that works and rubbish that doesn't.Even the photography seems to have gone badly wrong.  This may have just been the particular print I saw - I suspect it was - but the fact remains the colours were sludgy, the shadows were misty, the blacks not nearly black enough ... exactly as though the film had all been badly under-exposed.  Did anyone else notice this?  Did I see a dud print, or was the under-exposure deliberate, something which made it easier to insert the (not particularly impressive) digital effects?

The movie is made up of a string of really great scenes, most are as good a ride as the best of the first two movies. But it was frustrating to see them so uninventively strung together.I knew going in that Spielberg didn't direct. I also knew that the music was not by John Williams.

Lethal Weapon 4 was a great example of a good 4th installment after a bad 3rd movie. Though it doesn't need to be Spielberg, the director of JP4 needs to be a good actor's director; someone capable of really bringing the characters out of the actors (e.g. Bryan Singer or Stephen Frears).I read a few other reviews before seeing JP3 and I can't help agreeing that this movie was a great ride, but only a 'good' movie.

But let's be honest, do we really care?  All I ask for my hard-earned money is a competently made thrill ride that features big dinosaurs chasing after measly, little humans.  And on that level, JPIII is a pretty damn good success.  Certainly, this series is turning out better than the Jaws franchise.In this third-go-round, Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant, the now-world famous paleontologist who's having trouble coming up with grant money thanks to the fact that everybody in the world knows real dinosaurs exist.  Thus, Grant is a bit easily goaded when a couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) offer to pay big bucks for him to give them a little tour guide of the dino island.  Reluctantly agreeing, Grant brings along his protege, Billy (Alessandro Nivola), and they all head off to Isla Sorna.Not all goes according to plan, once Grant finds out the couple is really searching for their son, who was stranded six weeks ago.  Then there's that slight complication when this really big dinosaur called the Spinosaurus rips apart the airplane the group arrived in.  Afterward, there are only five survivors, and they set out to look for the missing boy and a way off the island.Plot-wise, it would probably be easier to simply state that a bunch of people get stuck on an island with man-eating dinosaurs.  After all, thrills would be the only reason anybody would watch this kind of movie in the first place, yet I find it funny I keep hearing complaints about bad story-telling and little characterization.  Really, the general movie-going public has got to re-evaulate their expectations a little more if they don't know what to expect out of a movie called Jurassic Park III.  Things such as story-telling and character development mean little to a movie about dinosaurs, much less a third film about said dinosaurs in a series, but those elements are adequate enough for the thrill-ride experience to work.Directed by Joe Johnston, this movie still often has the look and feel of a Spielberg film.  There's a bit of sentimentality here and there (as opposed to almost zero in the The Lost World), particularly in the beginning, with the scenes between Neill and Laura Dern (these moments work quite well), and later on in the film, between the estranged couple, played by Macy and a very annoying Leoni, and their son (these moments don't work so well). It's these scenes that lead me to question how so many people can proclaim this one superior to the original because of no sentimentality when it clearly has some.  Really, what I learned from such statements is that some people out there are just desperate to come up with something to bad mouth Spielberg.Johnston is not quite as good an action director as Spielberg.  By that, I mean there's not as much build-up to the attack scenes, nor is there really that much suspense, especially when compared to the nail-biting finale in the original and the trailer park scene in the The Lost World.  Johnston gets to the action quickly, almost as if though he were afraid he'd lose our attention otherwise.  It feels a little sloppy at times, but at least it eventually builds into that thrill-ride experience.The excitement delivered in spades, thanks to moments such as a nice little drag-down knockout fight between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex.  The guy I was rooting for didn't win, but it was still a damn good fight.  The raptors are sorely underused here, and there were a lot of possibilities Johnston could have come up with, especially set inside that village.  But, unfortunately, he abandons the enclosed setting (which really could have led to a lot of great thrills) and sticks to the jungle.Mind you, the jungle is still set up for quite a bit of fun.  The Spinosaurus makes several more appearances, one of them telegraphed by an amusing riff off Jaws and Peter Pan.  The pteranadons are put to good use here, with a sequence set inside a cage that's fairly exciting.  Sure, that evil stare that one pteranadon gives is pretty unintentionally hilarious, but stuff like that is appreciated in a B-movie.Speaking of B-movie, this one's a little more obvious of its roots than its predecessors, which is a plus.  JPIII has a pretty good sense of humor, as shown during a laugh-out loud dream scene that mocks the series itself. William H. Macy also gets in quite a few good laughs, a lot of them at the expense of the character himself!Special effects are what we would expect, meaning they're mostly excellent, with the only real complaint being that some of the dinos seem a little too CGI and the Spinosaurus' animatronic origins are far too obvious.  Mild complaints, though, considering the effects are really very impressive.Acting's also decent, with Neill, Macy, and Nivola registering positively. Michael Jeter's actually pretty likeable as a mercenary and Trevor Morgan is a kid who doesn't save the day or act as comic relief, thank God. However, Tea Leoni's just annoying, as she just about always is.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is about her that irritates me so; perhaps it's her speech pattern, or maybe just her general lack of acting ability.Don Davis' score is noticeably John Williams-ish.  The jungle drums from The Lost World are replaced by a more traditional action/adventure theme, which is effective enough if nothing spectacular.  The original movie's main theme is present, too, though for some odd reason, it felt oddly inappropriate to me.  I guess I was just hoping for more of the dark tone and atmosphere the second film gave us, and that musical theme from Williams (which is great, I'm not trying to knock it) sounds way too bright in tone and awe-inspiring to punch that feeling home.Where Jurassic Park III really stumbles is the ending, which is incredibly abrupt and lacking a bit in basic logic.  I'd go a little further, but I might spoil things somewhat, suffice to say that judging from what I saw, raptors don't really have very good auditory perception and we'll just leave it at that.Given that this is a third movie in a series known primarily for its action/special effects, I'd say Jurassic Park III rates quite highly as an entertaining action/horror excursion.  Perhaps not quite as intense as its predecessors, it still works considerably well, and it's story doesn't quite have as many idiocies as The Lost World, as it is known infamously for. JPIII was also probably the best sequel in a summer chock full of them. The Mummy Returns was a colossal disappointment, Rush Hour 2 pretty much repeated most of the same mistakes of Rush Hour, and American Pie 2 is...the sequel to the already dreaded American Pie.  Anyway, JPIII's good fun, and I guess it says something positive when I actually don't mind the prospect of another sequel.

But to be quite honest, many of the criticisms I've read here on IMDB have been completely unjust and blown out of all proportion. No.. it's NOT the worst motion picture in the world, and I can't quite understand why anybody would say such a thing, except to appear clever to our fellow reviewers. JPIII is a fairly decent action movie that should be seen on the big screen with a large group of friends. Not worth watching twice though. THE PROBLEMS   Apart from avoiding dinosaurs, the screenplay doesn't have any clear gut goals for Dr Grant and Co to pursue, which does makes it harder for the audience to emphasise with the main characters. The characters in this movie don't take matters into their own hand, they are not driving the movie forward to it's envitable conclusion. All they do is avoid dinosaurs - boring! If we look at the screenwriting techniques employed in Jurassic Park, it's easy to see why the original was far more exciting. For example, the characters were split into two groups; Dr Grant and the children had to find their back without being eaten, while Dern's bunch had to restore power to the island. This setups up two goals for the audience to follow, thus adding considerable interest to the story. It almost has the effect of watching two films at once, but with more cohesion. Thirdly, there is very good saying that applies here, less is more. If you cram too much action into a motion picture, particulary one without any worthwhile goals, then the audience are going to become desensitised.  By the end of the movie I was glad we didn't have one last showdown between Dr Grant and the Raptors.To the director's credit, Johnston is good at staging action sequences and the special effects shots are well thought out. I'm also glad he decided to remain with John William's brilliant score, it would have been pretty foolish to leave it out. However, Joe doesn't know how to handle suspense or horror scenes unlike his predecessor, Steven Spielberg. The legendary director knows how to use pace to create that eerily feeling of suspense, whereas Johnston is just content with giving us a rollercoaster ride. I also felt the screenwriters didn't take advantage of certainly opportunities that could have added more depth to the characters. Bringing two divorcees to the island is a good idea, but there is very little conflict between them - a chance sorely missed. If handled properly it might have made Macy's near death experience more heartfelt. And of course, there are the usual number of plot holes that plagued most blockbusters  1) In spite of being considerably larger than the T-Rex, the Spinosaurus managers to sneak up on Dr Grant when Rex can't even take a step without causing a small earthquake under it's feet. 2) There should have been soldiers guarding the island from nosy tourists or foolish poachers.  3) Can you really hear a phone ringing from inside a giant dinosaur? Probably not.  4) Dangerous Pteranodons have flown the coup and the army does nothing?Still, I would have overlooked all this if the movie had been better.

The effects are better then JP1 but time and technology moves on and the impact is lessened, we do finally get to see a big dino fight.A big gripe with JP3 is that the horror aspects have been so diluted.

There is minimal plot here - no scientific jargon or plausability whatsoever, though, and compared to the original it is almost a failure.  Based on two premises, (1) that velociraptors can communicate with each other on a high level, and (2) that a recently separated couple's 12-year-old kid goes missing on a dinosaur island off Costa Rica, you can probably figure out where the film's going to go if you've yet to see it, given twenty seconds thinking time.  Great action scenes, and those dinosaurs are continually going to amaze me - in particular the scene in which two massive carnivores are going at it while the small party of humans, led by Sam Neill, tries to avoid being squished in the process.

I guess they figured that it is better to have no story than a stupid story (see JPII). Dr. Allen Grant (Neill) is tricked into returning to dinoland by a couple trying to find their son, who was lost on the island in an inane parasailing accident in the opening scene.  Once there, it is the movie version of `Survivor' where the creatures carnivorously vote the cast off the island. The chase begins very early in the film, pre-empting any hope of a meaningful storyline.Director Joe Johnston started his career as an art director, doing visual effects for `Star Wars', so it is no surprise that this film emphasizes visual effects.  In this respect it is superlative.  The integration of computer generated images and animaltronics is state of the art and brings us a realism that could barely be surpassed by being amidst the dinosaurs in real life.  They have improved the look and movement of the dinosaurs and have integrated them more realistically with the actors.  Despite having a lower entertainment value from a screenplay perspective, this film is pure genius as regards visual effects and uses vanguard techniques that will surely become commonplace in sci-fi films of the future. There is not much to be said about the acting.  There isn't much meaningful dialogue.  All the actors are effective at looking terrified and then looking relieved only to be terrified again five minutes later. The only way I can rate this film is to average two components.  The story is a 2/10 and the technical component is a 10/10.  So I'd have to give it a 6/10.  It is worth seeing just for the visuals, but don't waste your time if a strong screenplay is your primary consideration in selecting a film.

The amount of detail and work that went into this production is amazing, and gives you a good idea of why budgets for films like this run into the tens of millions.The story itself (if you suspend your believability threshold for a few hours) was mildly interesting. The egg plotline was about the most outrageous thing I've seen in a while, and there are some interesting holes and unanswered questions what actually happened to the speedboat crew? why did the boy leave his companion to die hanging in the parasail? how did the Marines know to storm the beach exactly as the group comes running out of the jungle? For that matter, how could the Navy have deployed two amphibious vessels to that part of the Pacific in that short amount of time, based on a phone call from a paleontologist?

In the third installment of the dinosaur epic, virtually every plot element &#150; nay, every shot &#150; seems like a tired rehash of the ones found in the two previous works.  The only difference here is that the dinosaurs manage to serve as unwitting family therapists for a tiresome divorced couple and their precocious young son.Sam Neill, the star of the original film, returns in the role of nerdy paleontologist, Dr. Alan Grant &#150; and his presence merely reminds us of the power that was generated by this material before it lost its originality and luster.   With nowhere left to go with the concept, this third version is reduced to little more than a series of monotonous chase sequences involving the actors running around like mad through masses of jungle growth in the foreground while some impressive looking dinosaurs wreak havoc in the background.  It seems inconceivable to imagine that it actually took THREE paid writers to come up with a script as lacking in originality and interest as the one we have here.  The anticlimactic ending is particularly ludicrous and incredible (not to mention faintly distasteful since the final shot turns out to be a close up looking straight into a pterodactyl's rear end).  Unlike the previous two films,  `Jurassic Park III' fails to generate even a modicum of chills and thrills.  There is, literally, not a single scary or suspenseful moment in the entire film.  Where is Steven Spielberg when you need him?   (Joe Johnston took over the directorial chores for this outing).  At least Spielberg knows how to get the adrenalin pumping &#150; even with hokey material such as this.The real problem with this film lies in the nature of the series itself.  Unlike the `Star Wars' films, which provide us with an ever-evolving story line and set of characters that help to make each new installment an integral part of a varied whole, the `Jurassic Park' franchise is pretty much limited to finding new excuses to get people in front of those rampaging dinosaurs.  The writers of this latest version, desperate to bring even a trace of originality to the concept, play with the childish notion that the veloceraptors are actually able to communicate with each other.  In other words, we have left the world of `reality,' where dinosaurs are allowed to be dinosaurs, and have turned these magnificent creatures into reptilian versions of ourselves.  What could be more arrogant?With this third edition, the `Jurassic Park' series has hit its proverbial brick wall.

If you're looking for some cool action scenes featuring dinos chasing and chewing into people, some tense moments, and a B-movie feel, you might enjoy the summer aspect of this popcorn flick. This film doesn't come close to its previous incarnations in terms of story, laughs and interesting characters, but it does provide for some loud, good times every 10 or 15 minutes (think slasher but with dinosaurs!). The movie is also very short, so you aren't really all that bored between the action sequences. Of course, if you're already sick of seeing dinosaurs crunch into people, and don't really find mindless action summer movies all that entertaining, I would personally suggest that you never see this movie and live a fuller life. For those who do intend on seeing the film, be prepared for some uninteresting characters, yet another boy genius-type kid and Sam Neill weighing the whole thing down with his uber-serious moments, cliched dialogue and idiotic moments of talking to himself (read explaining the plot to the audience - I think they're talking to each other - uuuhhm and who are you talking to, Sam?).You're also not gonna give half a crap about the bogus mom/dad/son reunion that they decided to slap into this chomp-fest and will certainly roll your eyes after you see how one cellular phone could survive being thrown off a plane, eaten by a dinosaur, digested by the same, c*****d out, searched and found by certain humans, rained upon and then used to make a long-distance phone call. What on God's name were the screenwriters and director thinking there?!? But moronities aside, this movie is really all about action and dinosaurs, and if that's all you're looking for, you'll likely be somewhat amused by it all. Either way, the film barely lasts an hour and a half, so it won't be like you're investing too much of your time into it (is that an endorsement or what?!?). I'm also not sure why they even brought Laura Dern's character back for one scene and I personally would have liked to have seen more killings and more hardcore dino-stuff, but alas, maybe the next time around. Overall, the film succeeds in providing for some thrills, some chills, and entertaining moments here and there but fails in providing us with a plot that maintains interest, characters who we should care about and much originality (other than those crazy flying thingamajigs). See it for cheap fun, otherwise...move on!

I had heard it was a little more gory than the original (let's forget the sequel) but I have to say that I must have missed it. The velociraptors were back, this time talking to one another no less. Sam Neill tries valiantly to make this more than an obvious cashing in exercise but fails nonetheless. The arrival of pterodactyls was welcome and were strangely absent from the first episode. Little to make you jump or smile or cry or frown. Looks pretty but you get the feeling that maybe this cash cow should finally be put out to pasture after a lifetime of dedicated service. It boils down to being just some more dinosaurs in a plethora of movies depicting much the same thing. The original was so successful because of it's FX and originality, at the height of public interest in all things genetic.

Grant needs money bad to fund his diggings, so he reluctantly accepts the offer. But when they arrive at the island, it turns out the Kirbys had other motives. They have a son who is all alone on the island, and they want to save him at any cost. Grant has to face his worst nightmare once again. Oh, and their plane crashes.The Lost World was a huge disappointment to me, it was too silly, with irritating characters and it had a stinker of an ending. But fortunately, Jurassic Park 3 is everything the sequel should have been. It has bigger and meaner dinosaurs, and more suggestive environments and exciting scenes. The Spinosaur is great to look at (although he was a bit too scary for me), but my favorite dinosaur this time around was definitely the Pteranodon, the bird-dinosaurs. That scene was more exciting than anything that The Lost World had to offer during its whole running-time. Joe Johnston is certainly a good choice if you want action.The effects have not been modified that much since last time, but they are still spectacular. Of course you can see when it´s CGI-effects and when it´s Stan Winston´s mechanic dinosaurs, but still. My only complaint about the dinosaurs is that the classical T.Rex wasn´t showcased that much. And for the sequel (yes, JP4 is already on its way) it would be cool to see some water-based creatures. It was a relief to see Sam Neill again, oh have I waited for his return! He makes a solid performance as Alan Grant, and the supporting actors (William H Macy, Tea Leoni, Alessandro Nivola, Michael Jeter), do fine jobs as well. Trevor Morgan was a bit too much of a mix of Young Indiana Jones and MacGyver for me to appreciate, but he wasn´t all bad.Everything was great with JP3, untill that ending&#133; I mean, what was that? Did they run out of money, or ideas perhaps? Yes, it is actually worse than the ending of The Lost World (!), which means it´s really, really bad. It ruins the overall impact, sadly.Still a great roller-coaster for the whole family, and 90 minutes of running time is perfect. Now I´m looking forward to seeing the dinos for a fourth time.* * * ½  "},{"Title":"Just a Sequel...","Date":"14 October 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"   Right from the first shot, an aura of genericness that is common to many sequel movies became apparent and persisted through the end. Perhaps it was the lack of touch of  Spielberg & Co. that caused this movie to lack a distinctive edge. This is not to say that the authors (not Michael Crichton) did not try to up the ante. The characters do encounter dinosaurs that are bigger and smarter than in the previous movies, but the movie itself seems smaller and dumber. Smaller because we follow the fates of fewer people overall, the action moves through fewer scenarios and the film is over a half an hour shorter than the first two installments; dumber because it stretches its credibility further than the previous movies. Granted, suspension of disbelief comes with the franchise, but there are situations in this movie that violate its internal logic. For instance, only after the group gets stuck on Isla Sorna, the Kirby couple learns that Dr. Grant had never been on that particular Island before.  If they did their homework well enough to get the number one paleontologist to accompany them to that destination, then they would have had to come across this  detail.On the positive side, the movie had many suspenseful moments despite having fewer gore scenes, it made a sincere effort to be different by introducing the thematic element of the odd couple and it had quite passable special effects. The effects, though they were fun to watch, did not break any new ground, however (with the possible exception of a fight between two giant carnivores early on).  On the contrary, it was surprising to see that this movie probably employed live action effects much more than its predecessors, which, in a sense, is almost a step back.All in all, this movie will certainly be enjoyable to most fans of the genre, but the fact that this is just a sequel is conspicuous in more than one aspect of the movie.

This movie has just about sealed the fate of the Jurassic Park franchise. I didn't expect the movie to be as good as the first Jurassic Park but this movie can't even compare to the disappointed sequel The Lost World. Even though The Lost World wasn't too bad of a movie, it wasn't the best of Steven Spielberg's work. Jurassic Park 3 even falls below par of The Lost World.The story takes place a 4 years after the events of The Lost World. Sam Neill returns to take the role of Dr. Alan Grant who has just about returned back to his old life. That is until he is approached by a couple Paul and Amanda Kirby. They trick him into joining their crew to look for their son who was lost over the island of Isla Sorna (The second island) during a paragliding accident.Soon enough, things turn bad and Dr. Alan Grant once again has to keep himself and his peers alive from the horrors of the island. The storyline is pretty weak and the movie doesn't explain anything else about InGen's experiment, the only thing this movie has in common with the first two movies is the characters and setting.The thrill hardly reached a climax and was a bad excuse at throwing scenes to scary the audience. The special effects didn't improve on what we have already seen in the previous films. The role of the Spinosaurus didn't live up to the hype and besides the scenes with the Raptors, there isn't much expose on other dinosaurus. As I mentioned early, the storyline is weak and it was just about them trying to escape off the island (been done before in Jurassic Park) and along the way being thrown with lame action.Joe Johnston has done a terrible job at directing this film and I have no idea why the producers would want to make another Jurassic Park after The Lost World, this movies is all about milking all the money possible out of the Jurassic Park franchise. At least they could have given us a more memorable movie that this. It started with a bad note and finished with a bad note, not a movie that you would want to watch, even if your a Jurassic Park fan.

JPIII is the perfect summer movie. Unlike II, which was too long for me, this movie goes by quickly and pleasantly.GOOD QUALITIES Dr. Alan Grant is back, eight years older but not wiser! The special effects(CGI)are as magnificent thanks to thousands of special effects wizards.(The dinosaurs move and run as realistic as ever) The animatronic effects are great too thanks to Stan Winston and his team. The action is packed in a tight little 95 minute package which is good! (Never a dull moment) The comedy is good, which I think the series needs as of this point. They've got a new dinosaur loose in the series, the spinosaurus, which is very cool.BAD QUALITIES It has imagination but lacks originality.(It's the same old same old but ten times better) Some of the dialogue is so retarded that at times it's unbearable! Tea Leoni's character, Amanda Kirby, is very annoying.(I was kind of hoping for her to die) The script is bad(the biggest drawback)and it took four people to write it.

What does Spielberg think he is doing?  First this then AI. Jurassic Park 3 is no where as good as the original and it is even worse then number 2.  The plot is weak as anything, despite the fact that the Jurassic Parks are not exactly well known for their riveting plots. However there are several unrealistic points disregarding the fact that the entire movie is about really angry dinosaurs trying to kill some really stupid people.  Along with this are some irritating bits.First of all Sam Neill's character at first seems hell bent, dead set straight about not returning to the dinosaur island then changes his mind in a couple of ticks after a pair of complete strangers claiming to be multi-millionaires offer him a blank cheque.  Oh no, it's not as if you are going to dis-trust a couple of weirdos offering you a hundred million bucks. Like this guy has a moustache and that girl is hot so I can trust them.When the group predictably and inevitably land on the island Tea Leoni goes screaming her head off for her son like a headless chicken despite Neill's fruitless attempts at shutting her gob.  Don't worry its okay I think the man-eating dinosaurs will love my screaming voice.  The fact that the audience wanted to bash the supporting actress's head in right from the start did not help.Then come the dinosaurs.  Why the hell are they so angry?!  The dinosaurs are seriously pumped up about something or other.  They are incredibly mean and aggressive.  Okay I understand, these are scary dinosaurs but they are just too aggressive to the point of fakeness - if that's even a word.Now comes the creme de la creme.  This ten year old kid or whatever he is manages to stay alive for some 2 months on this island while two commando ex US marines armed with grenade launchers and SAS assualt rifles are picked off within 10 minutes of arriving on the island.  This kid jumps out of no where like jungle boy and saves Neill's life with some tear gas.  Like tear gas is not dangerous or anything it just temporarily vapourises your retina. Sure a 10 year old could use that.  I m sure his muscular 10 year old baby arms were good at battling the 500,000 tonne spinosaurus with attitude. These dinosaurs really had attitude!  Can you believe it - attitude!? This part just made me laugh and the rest of the movie was farcical I just could not take it seriously.  The movie lost the atmosphere, it lost its fear factor, it was no longer a movie just a heap of special effects.The film is fairly short too.  It just came and went.  I think it just took a couple of months to shoot using old dino models and the rest was done in front of a computer screen.I watched this in the cinema and the nincompoop of an attendant forgot to turn on the surround sound, which did not help either.

It succeeds mostly because it doesn't try too hard to be a sequel to Jurassic Park, it seems like a film all on its own. If I had to complain about something, the kid story is far too unbelievable to trick even the dumbest viewers and the characters sometimes do stupid things. Despite that I really enjoyed Jurassic Park 3 and it kept me highly satisfied and entertained for the overly short running time. The dinosaurs look fantastic; the film is awesomely entertaining and improves on the quality of the 2nd outing. The film also improves because it is much scarier than the first two Jurassic Park films. The scenes may not have as much build-up or suspense but in the moment, right then and there, they are absolutely horrifying, more so than the first two films. The new dinosaur creation, The Spinosaurs, also helps to give the film a slice of originality and creativity. The acting isn't great and the absence of previous director Steven Speilberg shows in dramatic scenes, but this remains a highly crowd-pleasing and enjoyable summer horror adventure flick that I'm sure you'll enjoy if you don't expect too much from it.

Suffice it to say that when Sam Neill is tempted back to the dino islands by a huge wad of cash via William H.

In fact, you pretty much know who's going to survive based on salaries in this movie.  And the rest of the film has a similar taint to it gouts of money thrown at the film to make it look decent and fistfuls thrown at the audience in the hopes that the audience will throw money back.

For JP movies I am willing to toss a lot out the window for a good thrill take away character development, pacing, plot continuity even, but at least exhilerate me!

I just couldn't stand it. A great disappointment. Then, in 1999, Mr. Lucas did the same with The Phantom Menace, and I realized it was a sort of Hollywood disease.

It's not going to be as box-office-success as The Lost World. I was pleased this sequel was 30 minutes shorter, though. It kept all simple. It has no villains, dinosaurs were leading characters again. It was not ambitious at all. In fact, my favorite scenes were those in which characters were not even in the island 1)When Dr. Grant asks for money for his research, and the audience just want to know about Jurassic Park and the San Diego's incident. 2)When talks about his theories with Lovely Dr. Sattler. 3) That wonderful sequence comparing a huge dinosaur and that stupid purple one named Barney.

This sequel ranks up as a stinker like Jaws 3 & 4. JP 3 is a perfect example of how Hollywood's creative endeavors have become extinct!I had the impression this movie was written and produced in the same day. The script is sooooo flimsy, the dinosaurs have more personality than the human characters, and all the cell phone antics are so idiotic. The movie is so lame the original musical score from the original JP movie was reused (talk about lazy)! And for crying out loud, the lame-ass scene including a Barney the dinosaur cameo makes JP3 an utter joke. And for all Sam Neil's character boasting of how the Raptors are so intelligent, the Raptors get fooled into his blowing into a Raptor fossil (and magically reproducing their sound)! Oh yeah, the raptors are looking right at the doctor. So much for superior intelligence. The boy who miraculously survived on the island for so long by himself hardly looks like he has been fighting for his life from ferocious and savvy dinosaurs. He looks as if he as been staying at a Holiday Inn-all clean and well-fed and poorly disguising himself with leaves and branches.The only part of this movie that had some decency (other than when it is finally over) was with the Pterodactyls. However, the movie demands great leaps of faith from its viewers. The boy gets taken by a flying dinosaur and dropped onto a nest. The doctor's assistant miraculously puts on a glider and soars through a dense pea-soup fog and finds the boy with no problem. Yeah right! Later, four pterodactyls are seen chomping on the rescuing man, but at the end of the movie all he has is a like a scratch on his shoulder! I guess those particular pterodactyls were vegetarians.The lake scene with the Spinosaur is completely laughable! The viewer is supposed to believe that a cell-phone will faithfully and perfectly slide up and down a boat while a ferocious spinosaur is shaking the same boat like a rag doll. Please!!!The ending of the movie is an absolute abomination! The ending is proof that the so-called writers had no clue how to write a script. The army shows up to save everyone! What a joke! I actually felt this is where the movie could have been entertaining.the army could have engaged in heavy artillery fire with the dinosaurs! But no, the ferocious dinosaurs are now no where to be found and everyone gets to leave the island as if punching out the time clock at work!I sincerely hope this is the last JP sequel!!!! 1/3 star out of 5!

I was thoroughly satisfied with the 1997 sequel. This one clearly suffers from the completely different crew and writers. It should never have been made, and isn't worthy of being part of the Jurassic Park legacy. When Steven Spielberg said no to directing a second sequel, they should've quit right away. Although it certainly wants you to enjoy it, I really couldn't get myself absorbed in this banal story. I knew this movie was going to sink from the moment those people arrived on the island. The music was completely terrible. It was the recycled John Williams theme from the first movie, but it wasn't even recycled that well. It sounded different, strange, and didn't come close to generating any sense of awe the original had. The music by Don Davis throughout the movie is completely lackluster or badly recycled from John Williams. When Alan Grant and company arrived (read crashlanded) on the island, the action starts and never stops for a second, and I'm not saying that as a compliment. It's just so damn hard to follow. One moment they escape from the Spinosaurus, and right the next they meet a T-Rex. After that the T-Rex gets killed by the Spinosaurus, and our group immediately meets a band of Velociraptors. The whole movie is nothing more than dinosaurs, silly jokes, and no story at all whatsoever. At least THE LOST WORLD had elaborate action sequences that lasted more than two seconds. And Jeff Goldblum to make us laugh a little. And some decent John Williams music. It was no masterpiece, but at least it took itself a little bit seriously. There is no suspense at all in this movie. There is nothing here to match the T-Rex-and-cars or T-rex-and-trailer action sequences from JP and TLW. Remember when Sarah from the second movie was lying on the breaking glass in the trailer? Weren't you on the edge of your seat? Or when T-Rex was breaking into the kids' car in the first movie?JURASSIC PARK III is immensely inferior to the first two films in terms of pure action and adrenaline. OK, so there is more action than you can think of. But the suspense utterly lacking. The ending here is absolutely awful. Remember in TLW when the T-rex escaped from the boat and roamed around the city? Wasn't that exciting, funny, and surprising? Or in the first, when our heroes were saved from the Velociraptors by the T-Rex? These were inventive, and satisfying climaxes. In this film, the climax is nonexistant. The movie just ends. It all but ends with a bang. That's what these movies are supposed to do.JURASSIC PARK III is not an awful film. But it is an average action film. It is a very by-the-numbers effort. It couldn't have been much better, though. This is a classic case of unnecessary sequel. The second movie worked because the script was decent and the director knew how to thrill an audience. But after that movie he had had enough of action films and refused to direct. Also the usual scriptwriter (David Koepp) didn't sign on for the screenplay. Hiring a new director, a new screenwriter, as well as a completely different crew was a bad idea. Why make another sequel? To make money? This movie is actually doing pretty poor business. The story is such an appallingly shameless rehash of the second film. In that movie, the idea of dinos roaming free without fences was fresh. JURASSIC PARK III has nothing new to offer.

By their acting you'd never know there was a thing that would actually kill a T-Rex, which makes me wonder, why would something so big be at all interested in a couple of tourists when there is so much bigger game available?The special effects were terrible. The standard terror of the firstT-Rex jeep scene and the Mercedes SUV destruction scene in 2 were waaaay better than the plane mashing scene in 3. The action in 3 was so fast, and so zoomed in close that I could hardly see what was happening, which is a pain.The idea of these creatures getting smart was great, but the direction didn't land it home in such a way to create that real sense of dread that it should, based on what we saw in 1 and 2.

Ten minutes into the movie and an awkwardly scripted scene raised some doubts about the latter point. I could sense we were already being rushed into the dinosaur effects ridden action by the bluntness of the conversation, during which Sam Neill explains to Laura Dern that the dinosaurs are more intelligent than they had previously thought. What a coincidence that this is relevant to the events that happen later. So a boring, inadequate excuse to get Neill to an island full of dinosaurs later, and the action begins.It seemed to me that the main point of this movie is to show some footage of dinosaurs attacking people. There is little reflection on the people affected, as in the first two Jurassic Park films. All we learn about Sam Neill's character (Alan Grant) here is that he would rather study fossils than be chased around an island full of living dinosaurs. Hardly a profound statement about human nature. The only underlying theme here is to address the moral questions and dangers involved in tampering with nature's processes of creating life. Unfortunately, the manner in which it is explored is rather unimaginative (and inconclusive). For example, there are some freakish looking baby dinosaurs in test tubes, who have apparently had some rather unsavoury experiments performed on them. Sound familiar to any other sci-fi fans out there?While a film does not, of course, need to be realistic to be entertaining, this movie is, at times, so unbelievable it seems ridiculous. In particular, the fate of the child lost on the island. And three mercenaries, each armed with rocket launchers, feeling the need to run from two dinosaurs. Half of the plot seems to be based around many of the central characters being incredibly stupid. Stupid enough not to adequately prepare for the eventuality that upon visiting an island full of dinosaurs they might be attacked by some. The effects on the dinosaurs are virtually flawless, as previously in the series. Several new types of dinosaur have been introduced, most noticeably the Pterandons and the Spinosaurus, which is basically a bigger, scarier super predator in the vein of the T-Rex. While these are impressive to watch, there is very little of the suspense that made the previous films in the series so entertaining. The focus here seems to be on providing fast paced, adrenaline-charged action.Unfortunately, none of it really ends conclusively, which left me feeling dissatisfied. There are also some rather misplaced light-hearted moments, that only serve to loosen the tension yet further. Although the mobile phone ring-tone joke is funny.Jurassic Park III feels like an old monster movie, with the Spinosaurus looming throughout the film, the characters being as stupid as they are, and the plot being as scrappy it is. I didn't hate the movie, but after being thoroughly entertained by the older films in the series, I was extremely disappointed by it. 6/10 "},{"Title":"Nice graphics, nice cast, nice try...","Date":"19 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Having watched Jurassic Park and The Lost World, I was eager to watch the 3rd in the JP series. Although Lost World was not as good as the original Jurassic Park, it was still a high quality movie. Based on what the producers of JP3 said, this one had to be the best so far. It seemed that either they lied or they are quite full of themselves... either way, JP3 does not meet the high standards JP and Lost World met.Let me go into further detail. Note that I might be revealing a few things here, so for those of you who haven't watched it yet  don't blame me if I spoiled it for you -) First of all  the dinosaurs are graphically the best ever made. In terms of motion, they're the best ever made. To put it simply  they're brilliant !Item 2  the acting of the cast is excellent. Sam Neil does a great job (as usual) and the rest of the cast doesn't lag far behind.Item 3  the quality of the plot isn't even close to JP 1... the basic concept is great, but that's where the good stuff really ends. There's been no deep thinking about the whole plot and what effect it has on JP fans and people who are new to JP. Basically, they seem to have forgotten to put it on paper and have 100-200 people reading it.Item 4 (watch out, I'm going to reveal things here...)  Not only is the plot terrible, the end is the worst I've ever seen in a movie... replace the end by a decent escape from the island and you get a movie that rates 1-1.5 higher here on IMDB. Be serious  there's no way  a. The rescue team (let's call them like that, not spoiling too much) could have gotten there that fast. b. They would do that, causing a political incident. c. Go through that much trouble for 5 (?) people. So it's far from realistic. They should have come up with something more realistc than this...Item 5  you clearly notice a difference between the directors... now that Spielberg's gone, you see camera movements changing to exactly those moves they shouldn't be making... JP 1 and Lost World had excellent directing... I've noticed quite a few flaws in terms of wrong use of panning, sweeping, etc. I suppose it's the difference between a good director and a very good director.Who's to blame for these things ? Probably everyone... the story isn't right (blame the guys who wrote it... JP1 and Lost World were based on a decent story by Crichton, now they've written their own... the result is clearly visible), the directing has flaws... The only people we can't blame for much are the people who took care of the graphics (both the models and CGI) and the actors.I suppose it's a matter of whether you like watching movies with lots of action and nice graphics... if you're looking for a good story as well, you might as well save your money and wait for it to reach your local TV channel.

I would be very surprised if Spielberg had any major creative involvement in this movie at all.  Joe Johnson's background is mostly in the special effects department and his flare for story, characters and depth are limited.  Sam Neill is the only semi-interesting character in 'JP III'.  William H. Macy's character is a nerd who would not survive this whirlwind of nature and the worst performance is by Tea Leoni, who plays a screaming, neurotic and naive wife and mother.

Enough, however, is enough and this third installment is nothing more than a quick buck.  Steven Spielberg decided he just wanted to be an executive producer and he gave the directing honors to pal and special effects geek Joe Johnston, whose previous outings in blockbuster territory were &#145;Honey, I Shrunk The Kids' and &#145;Jumanji'.Sam Neill is back as Alan Grant who devoted his life to raptor intelligence, claiming everywhere that he's never going back to the island.  But when Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and his estranged wife (Téa Leoni) ask them to be their guide while visiting Isla Sorna (the second island) Grant faces a dilemma.  He needs money for his work and the Kirbys promise him a lot. Before you can say &#145;the fast-food restaurants are gonna have a field day' the dino's are back on screen.  As usual they come in all forms and shapes; there are raptors (to me they are like old friends dropping in every couple of years), compys, pteranodons (great scene!), brachiosaurus and a bunch of others.  The T-Rex is underused which is a shame but in pure Hollywood &#145;bigger is better' way Johnston and his team of writers (three!!!) have come up with the Spinosaur a predator in every way of the word.  After a really short &#145;Hi we're back, do you remember Grant' beginning the movie kicks off with a Spinosaur &#150; T-Rex battle which serves no other purpose than to show off some effects and to tell the audience that the Spinosaur is really the meanest bad-ass among lizards.&#145;Jurassic Park III' is a ninety minute chase movie.  It resembles a video game version of the &#145;Wacky Races' cartoons.  I didn't care about the characters at all, except for Grant because we know who this guy is. Somehow I liked Alessandro Nivola's performance because he seemed the most human.  But William H. Macy (a great actor), Téa Leoni and that damn kid Trevor Morgan (why do these movies always have to have kids?!) are the most ludicrous, unlikely family you're gonna see on screen this year.  There is zero chemistry.  And I don't wanna see scenes of bonding and getting back together bull****.  I wanna see a frightening monster attack popcorn flick. In many ways &#145;Jurassic Park III' is exactly that.  Action scenes follow rapidly and some of them almost reach the level of the first.  Don Davis (who took over from John Williams) delivers a rousing, adrenaline pumping score while making hefty use of the famous Williams themes.  All this makes up for a nice cinematic adventure.  There are stupid, even lame jokes (to my own surprise I kind of liked the cellphone running gag) and the ending is preposterous, but overall, this is what I expected.Too bad though that movie moguls enjoy f***ing up a franchise.  The first one was such an amazing movie, mixing wonder with incredible suspense; the sequel was a very disappointing King Kong &#150; Godzilla rip off and this one is just a no-brainer cartoon where the death of a character has no impact at all.  Roll on number 4?  I'm there but with low expectations.

Sam Neil's character should know the island well enough to know his way around. OH NO, let's arbitrarily make this a DIFFERENT island than before so Sam doesn't have that luxury. A boy is dead, but OF COURSE it's not the important boy. The other boy is missing but MIRACULOUSY he appears out of hundreds of square miles of jungle.

The boy gets chased by dinosaurs but BY GOLLY somehow a companion has salvaged a shredded parasail and made it work perfectly, ripchord and all, and the boy is saved.

Everyone listen to the real Jurassic Park fan.  I have been a fan ever since the first second of the first Jurassic Park. Why?  Because I loved dinosaurs.  And to make a true dinosaur film (feast your eyes on the other two Jurassic Parks), you have to rely on the facts.  First off pterodactyls can't eat people, and they don't crawl on the floor, ok? Second, the Spinosaur is not that huge.  Thank you for listening me on that minor dinosaur analysis.  Now for the movie.Ah, yes.  The movie Jurassic Park 3 is finally in theaters, and it looks very interesting.  Hence Mickey's speech in Scream 3  The last part of the trilogy, it's break all the rules.  Jurassic Park 3 did not break any rules, except for the fact that the dinosaurs are poorly analysed.  But it still delivered the same rules, and that is not necessarily a good thing.The movie Jurassic Park 3 is about Dr. Allan Grant (Sam Neil, who is coming back from the first one), a paleontologist that is payed by a divorced couple Mr. Kirbey (William H. Macey, who should stick with dark comedies), and Mrs. Kirbey (Tea Leoni, who was good), to bring them to Isla Sorna to help them find their son, who got into an accident and is landed on the dinosaur-infested island.  When they get there, they are attacked by a spinosaur, and some of them die.  The spinosaur (as I have mentioned before that he is not the big) is now our big predator.  No!  Not the T-Rex or the Velociraptor, but the Spinosaur.  This is a letdown.  Now they have to get off the island.  This is followed by an attack by the Pterodactyls. This movie's biggest letdown was that it wasn't a survival movie, but a pick up the kid and leave movie. At the end, the velociraptor picks up his egg and leaves, then the helicopter arrives.  The idea of a smarter breed of Velociraptors wasn't developped!  There was no climax!  There wasn't even a big showdown with a T-Rex!  All of this happened in an exasperating amount of time of 1 h 25 minutes.You might think Oh yeah, like he lost interest at the end, but actually, I lost the interest at the part with the Spinosaur in the river.  That wasn't a good enough of a showdown for me.  What I wanted was the T-Rex to come and kick that big thugs butt.  But he didn't.  Even when they were in the Pterodactyl bird cage, I heard a sound and I was hoping that it would be T-Rex.  It wasn't.  Some dinosaurs that I could have recognized from the 5th grade made cameos, but the characters didn't exactly confront them.  For example, a Megalausaurus (a T-Rex with a horn) comes to eat them, and then he takes one whiff of Spinosaur crap and leaves, that's it.  A Compsognathus (the smallest dinosaur there ever was, who had a major part in killing a character in Jurassic Park 2), made a cameo, but theirs was smaller.  The compys looked at the building, and then they left.Another thing that bothered me is that the kid had been living in a dinosaur-infested island for 8 weeks, and he never god eaten.  He should have been dino dinner.Now, for the good things.Same Neil!  He was one good thing.  I'm glad he came back. The other thing was that when there WAS a velociraptor attack, it was worth it. That's all for the good things.  William H. Macy should not have been put on the cast. He is a sissy in this film.A warning  T-Rex dies at the beginning.  WHAT?!  MAJOR LETDOWN FOR JURASSIC FANS.  The movie should sound really bad coming from a hardcore Jurassic fan, but hear me on this.  I pity anyone who paid a lot of money to see this film, and I pity the people who have anticipated to see this film for such a long time.  Sam Neil and the Vlociraptor attacks were the only thing that saved this film from pure fail-ness.So,3/10 (which is the lowest I would ever give to a Jurassic Park)I hope another one comes, and I sure as hell hope it's better than this. And please, this time it WASN'T directed by Steven Speilberg, but Joe Huston.  That was yet another letdown.  Steven Speilberg would have known what he was doing.

This movie certainly won't be able to answer any of them for you. Except for maybe one Yes, at least it's better than The Lost World. Ooh, and maybe another one So this is what happens when you shoot a movie without a finished script.If you knew that big, man-eating reptiles inhabited a certain spot in a certain place in the world, wouldn't you have the common sense to stay as far away from that place as possible?  OK, well, neither did anyone in this movie, namely Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan), who decides to goPARASAILING within close proximity to Isla Sorna, the *other* island where genetically revived dinosaurs are running around.  Eric is then inexplicably surprised when he's attacked by some big scary flying creatures and must make an emergency landing.  His parents, Paul and Amanda (played by the always brilliant Bill H. Macy and the consistently irritating Tea Leoni), decide to go to Isla Sorna to rescue their son.  At least those two show some semblance of brain power and realize they'll need help, so under false pretenses they lure Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and one of his students, Billy (Alessandro Nivola), away from yet another under-funded dig in Montana, to help them in their search.  The Kirby's also hire some extraneous folks from Rent-a-Mercenary.com, because the dinosaurs have to eat someone. If you can sit through the boring first half hour of this movie you're golden. Once everyone gets to the island things start to heat up and at least there are some pretty-looking CG animals to keep you occupied. Another thing that may help ease the pain leave your sense of logic at home. At no time did I ever believe the public at large would allow an island like this to exist, especially since there are dinosaurs living there that can FLY AWAY if they want to.  Anyway, back to the effects.  Since that T-Rex is just *SO* '93, we now have a Spinosaurus, which resembles a giant duck.  However, the Tyrannasaurus does end up making an appearance, during which it has a pretty intense fight with Dino-Mallard.  Also making another go at stardom are those super-brained Raptors, now enabled with the gift of squawk-speak (oh, right, that whole bird theory again).  In addition, for those disappointed with their absence in the first movie, there are plenty of winged Pteranodons, a glimpse of what happens when good pelicans go bad.  Actually, most of this movie  *looks* good, that is if it relates to the dinosaurs. Industrial Light & Magic couldn't be bothered with the other effects, so they were probably done by the new kid, who worked on them at home using his Macintosh G4 and a flatbed scanner.The weak side of this movie (well, one of the weak sides) lies in the lack of real story  Kid crashes on island, parents crash on island, parents try to find kid on island.  Chaos ensues.  Wasn't that kind of like the first two movies?  Dr. Grant is too busy lecturing everyone on the evils of making giant ducks to leave any breath for constructive thinking, and Billy is too preoccupied with the wow factor that made the first JP so magical.  The others in the group are just a little too dumb to do much of anything at all.  So the film rambles along its little road of action sequences followed by more action sequences (but they're at least good sequences), until it ends up running on vapors for the last 15 minutes.  At this point, all the effects have outstayed their welcome, and we all just want to go home.  My grades for Jurassic Park 3 (New grading system!

After viewing this movie it is easy to see that Spielberg never intended another sequel but since it was obvious that one would make a ton of money he put his name on it anyway. It was as if director Joe Johnston asked him if it would be okay if he borrowed a location or set, a few computers and graphics program to make dinosaurs and throw together a 90 minute movie with the Jurassic park name on it in return for royalties.This movie in a nutshell adds nothing to the previous two movies. The second movie was inferior to the first also but it at least entertained the idea these dinosaurs could be accidently or intentionally brought to the mainland( San Diego since every other city has been decimated by giant monsters)but all this movie offers is the idea that Raptors talk back and forth(big deal, we saw that in the first two) and a Spinosaurus which I had to read the previews to find out what it was since they don't mention its name in the movie.Character development is virtually non existant. Kid gets lost in an area that apparently everyone knows by now is inhabited by dinosaurs but goes para-sailing with a friend anyway. Parents dupe Sam Neill into helping them rescue him. Thats it. No trying to develop a plan to get rid of these animals to right the wrong of creating them in the first place or even destroying the island itself in an explosive finale.If this had any name other then Jurassic Park on it I would have probably enjoyed it more. And Sam Neill does make a valiant attempt at continuing his role from the first one(and shame on him for doing it). But as far as the Jurassic Park franchise goes this barely ranks above a b movie in my book. The first one made you think WOW! this could happen, the second made you think this could happen as a result of the first, the third didn't make you think at all. Any more of these and you'll probably see raptors running in the streets with hockey masks and chainsaws. You have been warned.

That leaves the other hand, which has the burden of holding all that is wrong with the movie story-wise.  There are so many points where you, the audience member will want to shake your head and say What? or possibly Why? and most definitely Huh???  The characters are annoying (the ones who live, which are easy to pick out...the names above the title and of course the kid.)  The rest are quickly dispatched Star Trek Style. The remaining ones, plunging through the dino-laden jungle like an especially loud herd of elephants, made me want to yell SHUT UP! if only they could have heard me.  Unfortunately, no helpful dinosaur showed up to eat them as I wished. Which is surprising considering the never-ending supply of dinosaurs on the island.Many things do not make sense in this film, from the relative durability of structures (the dinosaur retaining fences do not hold, but the Spinosaurus is put off by a half-demolished hut...) to the raptors so intelligent they can count their eggs, figure out some are missing and pinpoint the location of the thief, but never quite manage to outwit the supposedly smarter humans (except for the aforementioned appetizer people.)  And the ending was soooooo lame.  I don't need to reveal it but boy was it unbelievable.  Too easy, like they just gave up on the story and decided to end the movie.  I could never tell what the time of day was, it seemed to switch from morning to afternoon, to morning and then to night all in about 15 minutes of screen time. Many more items could be mentioned, but they can be summed up as lazy screenwriting.For the record, I liked Jurassic Park (the original) very much and this doesn't hold a candle to that flick.  I liked the dinosaur effects in all three movies, but although they should have been better in this film they weren't.  Maybe more dinosaur sequences would have improved the story.  My three year old son was unfazed by the dino fight scenes, they weren't that scary.  I was startled many times by the exceptionally loud noises, but not the menacing dinosaurs.  I wish it would have been a better story, but have pretty much come to expect this state of affairs in Hollywood today.  Too bad for us.

Have I seen any part of this scene yet? No, no, great, it'll get good again.I have to admit, that's what kept going through my head while watching this movie. The exciting action pieces were all that carried this fairly flimsy movie through its meager 95 minutes. The plot isn't really thought through, at least compared to the original, which went out of its way to be logical and set up the story. And it still offered some excellent action (my favorite being Ellie vs. the raptor when she was turning on the power). I also liked The Lost World, though I haven't seen it in a long time. As far as this sequel goes, it seems to be in a mad rush to cart everyone off to the island, for a fairly transparent reason, just so we can see a handful of characters run around and spout bad lines. The plot has been turned over a hundred times, so I don't need to waste time explaining. It isn't the most intelligable scenario I've ever heard of, and Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) seemed a little too willing to be a part of it all, after mentioning earlier on that nothing could bring him back to those dinosaurs. And I would have expected him to be only a little more upset by the fact that he was ONCE AGAIN stuck on an island with the man-eating prehistoric beings, running for his life. A little too calm for my tastes.Amanda and Paul Kirby's (Tea Leoni and William H. Macy, respectively) rekindled admiration and love for one another once stuck in this nightmare seemed terribly inplausible. I can see people working together to survive, but falling in love again? I don't know, running for my life with my ex probably wouldn't turn me on to them again. And their wayward son Eric (Trevor Morgan) is so terrible a character, you wonder why we couldn't have likable JP kids again, like in the original, and even the sequel. (Okay, so the girl sneaking along on the trip in The Lost World was sort of a annoying, but I still liked her character.) Eric is way too resilient, and to have survived for 8 weeks, when in a matter of minutes, two very tough adults, armed with weapons, were killed once they arrived on the island, just doesn't make sense. When he's finally found, looking like some Lord of the Flies reject, smirking about how he survived for so long, you sort of wish he wasn't found at all, or ended up being the sound heard in the dinosaur's stomach in the distance (and not the phone--God, that was weak.)And for further complaints, Billy's (Alessandro Nivola) decision to bring along the raptor eggs made no sense, since he should have known better. It seems the only reason that happened was to give an excuse for why the characters were being hunted down, other than, The dinosaurs are hungry, and then, so later on, when he rescues Billy from the pterodactyls or whatever the hell they're called, or however it's spelt, he can redeem himself and be a hero. Sort of a tired idea. And last, but not least, Ellie (Laura Dern) is so terribly wasted! Why couldn't she come along. She and Alan have such amazing chemistry together, I would have loved to see them back together. The characters that ended up on the island had zippo chemistry, and no one seemed to really fit with anyone else.Anyway, the movie does have its merits. The action pieces are fairly exciting, though lacking some suspense. Still, they were carried out fairly well, and went on for some time. Made the movie almost seem to be a non-stop adventure, had it not paused for Amanda and Paul to make up, or for Alan to spout some wisdom, and Eric to be precocious.As for the acting, it's minimal at best. Sam Neill gives a good show, and I like his accent. He brings some depth to the characters in the movie. William H. Macy is a great actor, but gives a fairly weak performance here. Action movies are not his forte. I think he's better in good comedies and dramas. He belongs in a better movie than this. Tea Leoni, actually, isn't too bad here. She has a good delivery of most of her lines, and I loved her big freak-out scene, with the body in the parachute. She executed that one brilliantly. Would have liked some more of that type of panic and frenzy from her, she did it well. Alessandro Nivola is also fairly good, and I thought he gave a likable show, at least before we found out about the eggs he stole. Trevor Morgan is annoying as the requisite kid, and I could have done without him in the entire movie. Michael Jeter has a limited screen time as Udarsky, and I didn't like him. His voice got on my nerves, and he even got a chance to scream like a blubbering idiot, which only made me happier to see him go. And Laura Dern, reprising her role as Ellie, is terribly underused, and I really liked her limited performance. It's too bad she didn't show up more often.Overall, Jurassic Park III is not a great movie. As a whole, it's a disappointment. But there is some great action, and for fans of the original score (sorry, that doesn't include me, it sort of got on my nerves after a while), it's here again. The production standards are a little lower (check out the terrible backdrop scenes in the close-ups of the earlier hang-gliding scenes) and the setting is a slightly smaller scale, and sort of feels like it's an adventure through the junkyard of the previous two films. The acting and story are so-so, but at least it's sort of fun. In the end, I recommend it for some mindless fun, but don't waste nine dollars on a ticket, and wait for it to come out on video.

There is very little to the story but it's enough to keep the movie interesting in terms of plot.  That was pretty much how the first 2 were, but it was never the story that kept the movies exciting.  It was the dinosaurs, and there are plenty of them in this one.  There's even a fantastic showdown between the mighty T-Rex and the all new Spinosaurus.  Although it was very entertaining to watch, the dino battle should have been left for the end, instead of near the beginning, but that is only a minor complaint.  Then there is the length of the film, WAY TOO SHORT.  Some of the action scenes could have been more drawn out, and there could have been more room for character development, but, once again, another minor complaint.  The movie is everything it promises to be, and it never wears out its welcome.  For my money, Jurassic Park III is one of the best movies of this summer, bested only by Planet of the Apes.

It was great!The first half of the movie has a very interesting plot showing how Alan Grant has figured out more about the Raptors' way of communicating. At the same time he is scared to death only thinking about returning to the island in order to find out more about the dinosaurs, until a rich couple pays him to be their guide in an airplane guide over Isla Sorna. Of course the plane crashes.The director has added one creepy nightmare scene and some great action scenes throughout the film. The music and sound is loud and clear, and especially in the first half you get everything you expect from a good action-movie. However, when the plane crashes, everything changes.To show what Alan Grant meant about how the Raptors communicated, they have made the Raptors sort of Disney-like in their way of responding. In stead of being scary, they look cute. In addition, the entire rest of the movie is actually about how the dinosaurs can be very scary, but at the same time very fascinating. Hollywood can't leave a film without morals either, so the parents of the boy the crew is looking for are divorced, but I'll leave it to the reader to figure out for himself how the ending turns out. There's plenty of family values to «learn» from in JP3.However, what disappointed me the most, was the music. John Williams, the master composer of almost all the Stephen Spielberg films, made the music to JP1 and JP2, but this time they hired someone called Don Davis who made a wreck out of the whole Jurassic Park score, and almost made no original music of his own. There might have been some good arrangements of the beautiful John Williams theme, but they were not many.But, as I said in the beginning, I recommend that you see the movie, because it's one hell of an intro!

Even the mediocre-at-best The Lost World is better than this thing.Sure, the dinosaurs look great - one might go so far as to say that they look better than ever.  And some of the action set pieces are pretty fun, though none of them come even close to the first T-Rex attack or the climactic Raptor chase in the original Jurassic Park.But the film cannot overcome its own flaws.  I'll be the first to tell you that the Spinosaurus is a wicked-cool dinosaur.  But there's not even the slightest attempt to explain why this beast, apparently bigger and badder than T-Rex, pops up in the third installment without having appeared or even so much as having been mentioned in either of the first two.That sort of sums up the fatal flaw of the entire film it's pointless. Nothing is ever adequately explained.  None of the characters, even the venerable Dr. Grant, is given anything interesting to say or do.A note for the writers and director Johnston Pay attention, as you seem to have missed some important lessons in drama class.  A standard story structure for a film such as this would be Rising action, climax, falling action, roll end credits.  The path you've chosen instead rising action, roll end credits.  Additionally (MINOR MAYBE SPOILER UPCOMING), well...let's just say that the deus ex machina plot resolution is weak at best.  I'd really like to learn more about the digestive system of a spinosaurus, though, since apparently a sattelite phone can pass through it unharmed. (END SPOILER, THANKS)So...my reccomendation?  Dust off your VHS or DVD of the original Jurassic Park to get a dinosaur fix.  If you're headed to the the theater, go for Planet of the Apes instead.

It has its thrills and fun and is probably one of the best examples this year of mindless fun.Jurassic Park 3 starts of with a young boy who's paragliding near Isla Sorna (Site B from JP2 The Lost World). He crashes down and his parents start looking for him. They hire Alan Grant who knows the dino's best to guide them through the island. Billy, Alan's protegé, and three mercenaries come along with them. Of course, the plane crashes and we're back in the good old world of 'Oh and ah, but soon it'll be running and screaming.'What can I say? I liked the film very much. Of course there werre flaws, but I'll get to them soon.What was great? The actors were fantastic in their roles. Sam Neill and Laura Dern act like they never and the new people (William H. Macy, Téa Leoni, Alessandro Nivola) are perfect added in the JP-franchise. The script was good enough, not pretending to be more than it is a big popcorn flick. The dino's... The dino's were (as always) awesome!!! The Spinosaurus who kills the T-Rex in the first half hour, the raptors with their 'new' intelligence and the pterodactycles (is this written right?) are just breath-taking CGI. The pacing of the film was perfect. Johnston introduces us to the characters in the first 20 minutes and then... WHAM! We're in the middle of the action and we never get out until the end credits. Joe Johnston is a perfect replacement for Spielberg (who disappointed us all with JP2 The Lost World a bit). Another cool thing was bringing in the birdcage, which also featured in the original Jurassic Park-novel by Michael Crichton. Remember they did the same thing with the waterfall in The Lost World.Now then what was not so great? First of all the length of the film 88 minutes. All those screenwriters (most of them uncredited) couldn't come up with something more? One big final battle? Which leads us directly to the ending, which is too quick. Another thing the three mercenaries die too quickly. If they lived a little longer, we could know them better and decide to care or not care if they died, but now they die so quickly that we don't.Then there were three things I liked to see in the movie, but which weren't in it - Paul and Amanda Kirby visiting Ian Malcolm who refuses to go back with them (since he was the one who actually was on Isla Nublar, Alan wasn't) - The film should've take place on Isla Sorna, the original Island. It would make it more believable that they actually hired Grant for the mission and it could provide some cool scenes with Alan revisiting some good old places like the Tyrannosaur-paddock. - The ending. When Alan calls Ellie, it would've been cool if Ellie called John Hammond immediately. He has far more influence than she has and it would make it even more believable when all those marines show up.Despite these flaws, I really enjoyed the movie and rate it a 8/10.

And here is where my review comes into place.The summer of 2001 has greatly dissapointed me, there has been not one decent movie that has captured audiences everywhere and broken Box Office records.  It seems to me JP3 was a huge dissapointment.I will start with the upper end of the movie.  The graphics, the sound, good thrills, and new monsters make this movie an average sequel.  It was good to have Sam Neil back in the driver seat.  He is great in this role, and in my opinion is what really kept me from hating this movie.Now the black part.  For one I really don't know why the twelve people that wrote this movie couldn't put together a better script.  The beginning was okay, the body of the film was slightly below average, and the ending of the movie, made me darn right angry.The beginning sets off good in reuniting the characters, and telling why they need to go back.The body was below what I expected in the fact that 3 or 4 people died right when they got there and the worse part of that, was I didn't even see who died or when and where!  That whole scene with the airplane left me dazed and confused at who was even alive and how they died.  Too many people died at the beginning and you knew who was going to live and who would die before you land on the island its too simplistic.  The script had no imagination at all in the chase scenes and no new approach to the way the dinosaurs were. In fact the whole movie seems more cartoon fiction than science-fiction adventure.The ending was such a joke because of what made the first and second movies so great, the raptors and the thrill of them hunting the characters.  You will be as stunned as me when you see how they survive when surrounded by a herd of raptors.I think this movie had potential, but was greatly deminished by the lack of effort by the writters, and the director.  I think Speilberg is the only man who can man handle JP series, and better be in for the next one or the whole Jurassic Park name will be greatly ruined.

A.I. was visually spectacular, but none of the characters were very likeable or interesting.  JP3 is one cool effects sequence after another -- the characters just marching from set-up to setup.Other than Sam Neill and maybe the kid none of the other characters in this movie really brought much to the screen.  William H. Macy is a terrific actor but he seems sadly out of place.  Tea Leoni is a good actress and a lovely lady, but she manages to be as asexual as possible in the role and the script didn't really give her much depth.That said, the movie is entertaining and aptly short -- it only runs about 90 minutes.  The directors thankfully resisted the temptation Spielberg gave into with A.I.; the temptation to keep going and going until the Special Effects guys got tired.  There are a few new dinos in this movie, the pterodactyl sequence is especially well done.The credits, ironically, state that the movie is based upon characters created by Michael Crighton -- but that's not true.  Clearly the movie is based upon characters created by evolution.  The humans in the movie are merely chum for the real stars to chase and eat.

Not only is it a sequel with no grounding in the popular Micheal Crichton novels, but Steven Spielberg wasn't interested in having anything to do with it either. Still, the show must go on, as long as there is money to be made. What results is a film that performs well below any low expectations that a movie-goer may of had. For example, not only does the picture do away with such novelties as plot, it goes so far as to abandon the fundamentals of plot structure. The premise of the plot contains gaping holes, the suspense and action sequences are not built properly, there is no development of characters, no climax to the film. Things just sort of happen, and usually these things are quite stupid. The acting itself is quite hard to judge, because the script doesn't seem to call for any true acting to be done. The cast does what it can... Most seem to be going through the motions until it is their time to be eaten. William H. Macy seems to be doing this movie only for his own personal amusement of doing an action film; he plays his part with a certain light-heartedness that mocks the absurdity of it all. Macy knows this movie for what it is. Sam Neill, on the other hand, takes his role far to seriously, as if he is making a desperate attempt to be once again recognized as a serious actor. Sadly, this movie is not the vehicle for Neill to bring his career back out of obscurity. Even Laura Dern embarasses herself by making a few short cameos; both her and Neill appear to be confused that they are there for original Jurassic Park nostalgia only.Much is to be said for the complete lack of plot. I personally believe that it was completely improvised; the cast might have been instructed to do whatever they wanted, as long as every 5 minutes they ran around and screamed a lot. The digital dinos were added later wherever they seemed to fit. Events are so random that one wonders if the screenplay was a Mad Lib that the writers filled in as the shooting of the film progressed. It is baffling that people could be paid so much and come up with so little. The only positive thing about this movie is that it does attempt to throw in a few omitted scenes from the first two Jurrasic Park novels, namely the aviary. However, considering the context in the rest of the movie, even fans of the books will find it hard to enjoy even these small pleasures. The special effects are quite impressive in some scenes, but in others it is almost like their budget came up short. In the end, there is an odd mix of near-perfect special effects and what appears to be rubber dino heads on sticks being waved vigorously in front of the camera. Even the good special effects are wasted, however, because the dinosaurs are constructed to look cartoonishly evil with longer snouts, pointier teeth, longer claws, longer tails... these are not the believable dinos of the original but, rather, computer-generated reptiles that have obviously been altered to look much more vicious. The raptors are made so intelligent in this movie that at times you are wondering if the characters will accidentally stumble onto raptors doing advanced calculus theories. Oh, and they talk to each other in silly squealing raptor-speak. The ending of this movie is utterly ridiculous, and, even worse, this completely inane finale is completely predictable. In conclusion, if you want nothing more but to see people get eaten by dinosaurs, go ahead and shell out the money. That's all you're getting. Thankfully, the movie is short enough that the pain is minimized for everyone else.

Beginning with the Spinosaurus attack, which was the worst monster movie crap. What happened to the basic, animalistic curiosity that made the T-Rex attack in the original so frightening? Where was the feeling that the animals were acting on instinct rather than the directors whim? I won't even go into depth regarding the CGI Brachiosaurs that looked like their skin had been painted by taggers. Everything shot in this movie that concerned the animals seemed to have a 'look at me, I'm a Dinosaur, ain't I neat?' quality about it. The worst was the This is a new Jurassic Park Movie moment when the T-Rex was killed to make way for the bigger, more threatening Monster.Sam Neil and cast were wonderful and blievable, despite the story that was predictable , and the sudden and unexplained evolution of animals (Can anyone 'splain to me where the Spino came from).I really wonder if those putting this movie together saw the two previous movies, and what focus group made them decide to ignore the  detail and research that went into them (For instance how come the Pteradactyls are just NOW leaving the island, when at the end of the Lost World, they were clearly seen roaming free).This was just painful, angering and a waste of money. It lacked any of the intelligence or thought process that was in the first two, and was just a stupid reason to look at Dinosaurs, that were not even done as well as the first two movies (except for the Sam Winston Animatronic ones, and YES you could tell the difference this time).Universal Pictures usually only has good movies when Spielberg puts one out (probably bailing them out of the debt they get in for shuffling out the other crap they put out all year) and they always have to push the envelope by plodding out half baked sequels to his good work (Can anyone say JAWS?)

The answer is simple - If they were answered, there would be no movie.  This picture is as simple as they come, and considering it's so much fun, it makes up for its shortcomings.JP3 is much more visually imaginative than The Lost World Jurassic Park.  Its action scenes are more involving and pleasing.  I'm not going to say the special effects are improved, because, in my opinion, they're on the exact same level as the first two, including one scene (special effect) straight out of 1998's Godzilla, but the movie does make better use of them, including a fantastic scene of a pteranodon carrying a boy across canyons.  I still can't tell if the boy was CG or the real actor in front of a green screen.  Also, another imaginative scene involves the boy jumping from one rocky pillar to another.

The only thing that might have kept me away from this one is that Steven Spielberg, who directed the first two Jurassic Parks, wouldn't be behind the camera for this one, but instead take the role of the executive producer. Then I found out that the director would be Joe Johnston. I had seen two of his films (Jumanji and October Sky) and had enjoyed both of them. So I figured that the movie couldn't be very bad, especially since they brought back the main character from the first film, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill). I didn't think that JP3 would be as good as the first film, but I thought that it would be better than the second. I was right.Jurassic Park 3 takes place after Jurassic Park and The Lost World. When a wealthy adventurer named Paul Kirby (William H.

But when they get there, the plane crashes and Grant, the Kirbys and the rest of the people on the plane are suddenly stranded on an island full of dinosaurs. And if you've seen the first two films, you'll know that that's not a good thing.Sam Neill returns as Alan Grant, and gives a fairly good performance. Other performances include William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, Alessandra Nivola, Michael Jeter, Laura Dern (Who makes a small appearance in the film, reprising her role from the first film), and Trevor Morgan as the Kirby's son Eric. I thought that some of the best performances were Alessandra Nivola as Alan Grant's assistant, Billy Brennan, and Trevor Morgan as Eric. Laura Dern was good too, but see wasn't in much of the movie.

The feeling is the same as the one you would get if they had had troubles during filming and had had to finish the film because they were paid to do so. And what about the script...? It's simply a collection of nonsense. Almost every scene is a carbon copy of Jurassic Park's. I couldn't give credit to my eyes when Alan accepted (again) to go to the island for money. Incredible but true. The music is like they had the Jurassic Park sountrack CD and used it. There's nothing new, just the same themes for each scene. And what's the relationship between Alan Grant and Ellie Satler? Are they married? Are the kids his sons? It seems like they aren't married, but, where is her husband? They don't say a single word about that in the whole film. It seems like they don't know what will be best in Jurassic Park 4. Yes, that's something really evident in many scenes. And it's also evident that Jeff Goldblum didn't accept to do this horrible film (or perhaps asked for a lot of money) and thus he wasn't here. That explains that scene where Eric Kirby tells Alan Grant that he also read Ian Malcolm's book, and that he thinks he's too clever by half. That line (those aren't the exact words anyway) doesn't make sense at all with what we saw in JP and JP2, and it sounds like a sentence for Goldblum's future in JP4.My only hope is not to see more Jurassic Parks... at least in this horrible line.

Dinosaur attacks are good and all, but a good movie needs some breaks in between for characters to develop, etc. You could tell that several characters were expendable from the start (i.e. the parasail operators and the mercenaries), which eliminated any surprise. In contrast, no main character died, even though two came close. The Spinosaurus, which was the main dino in the film, was poorly done, because it looked rather robotic.  It also seemed to go after the people relentlessly, which is cool if it's a smart dinosaur like the raptors, but the spino was big and dumb, and it could've gone after any other dinosaurs. There certainly wasn't any shortage of them.  Why is this dinosaur featured so prominantly in this film if it never appeared in The Lost World? The raptors got worse also.  They got smart and could make sophisticated noises though an air chamber of some sort.  At one scene, they appear to be carrying on a conversation as if they were cartoons.  They never had any really cool raptor surprises.  Twice, Grant was surrounded and twice he got away, the second time by blowing on a horn. On the brighter side, Grant got friendlier, while still giving the impression of a tough guy.  He even had a few funny lines in the movie.

Other than that minor issue, I would give this action packed film a 10!P.S. if you don't agree with me please send me an email stating your opinion, thank you.

JP3 is a great summer thrill ride, with no real turn-offs both in acting and wrting. Joe Johnstone and the Dinos do a splendid job keeping the pace and keeping you interested, in fact, I'd say Sam Niel was better in 3 than he was in 1.Maybe it was the fact that their is only one child in this movie, but he acts like an adult so there is no real this-is-a-kiddie-movie backlash.There was also a lack of the hokey-ness that plagued the previous two movies, more so on #2 than on #1. All in all, I'd say this was a very well done summer action flick, perfect for a little escapism. If I had any qualms about JP3, I'd say it was probably a little short, and others have agreed. You don't hear that said about many movies these days with the trend towards overblown affairs (Pearl Harbore). It could be construed as a compliment.The ending of the movie definitely leaves it open for sequels just as the previous versions have done, and can you blame Universal ? They know a good money maker when they see it. With technology progressing the way it does so rapidly, by the time JP4 comes out, we'll all be able to render a T-Rex on our Dell powerbooks !

While it's certainly not the best film ever made, it certainly is far better than its reputation. It's hard to disagree that the series was pure formula at this point, but I guess that is why I find it so hard to hate it delivers exactly what one would expect from a crazy dinosaur flick great special effects, well shot chaotic action, and plenty of mildly creepy moments. Director Joe Johnston knows how to direct both action and horror without going too over-the-top and in that regard, he did a solid job here. Granted, there is not a whole lot of depth to the whole story (the fact that there were multiple screenwriters is somewhat evident). However, minor story problems aside, it's 90 minutes of pure spectacle that holds up with repeated viewings and is definitely competently edited and put together (something that can't be said for many big-budget studio pictures these days).

I'll be very honest.  I have been hyped for this movie for the last 3 years since it was announced.  Just a few weeks before it was released, I was getting a bit worried that it might not be as good as I imagined.  I was proven wrong.  The formula running in this really works.  The characters may not be the best in the world, but they are developed really well for the kind of movie that this is.  I saw a nice growth of Grant's character.  Action-wise, you couldn't ask for better.  This movie has more dinosaurs and a lot more action than the first two combined.  It's easily one of the best popcorn movies of 2001.  If you're interested in story, it's there, but not exactly the most delving plot for a film.  It's a simple story that just works, and very well in my opinion.  I personally liked it better than The Lost World because it goes back to the essence of Jurassic Park in that it is a story of survival against the dinosaurs.  So in closing, I liked this movie a lot.  It continues the saga with a fresh new approach to it while still remaining faithful to its roots.  If you like a good edge-of-your-seat adrenaline ride with some nicely rounded characters, go see this movie.  If story is more your thing, steer clear because this one is not going to challenge your intellect.  So sit back, buckle your seatbelt and enjoy the ride.

J-III falls victim to the former following a simple overused plot  kid gets lost, separated parents join together to find son, they all encounter dangerous situation and bond in a newfound family in their attempt to survive.  Of course, in this film, the dinosaurs provide the catalyst for the danger.  These creatures are fun to watch and give us a delightful fright every few minutes. They are certainly worth the price of admission.  Sam Neill, William H.

Only Trevor Morgan as the young, lost son excels in an emotional portrayal equal to his role in The Patriot. Bottom line  if you want a creative and innovative science fiction trilogy, stick with Back to the Future.  However, if you want all the fun and don't care about intellectual storylines to work the brain, Jurassic Park III will certainly suffice.  Watch it with your pet lizard;  he'll like it too.

This, however comes as no surprise to anyone.On the surface, JP3 has some enticing perks effects-wise.  I heard rumors of a Spinosaurus/T-Rex rumble and was instantly intrigued.  The movie even seemed to be coherent plotwise at first....... Then i went and saw it the day it came out.From a truly entertaining perspective, the movie was appreciable. Dinosaurs, attacks, and action scenes were quite impressive as expected. The Pterodactyl segments were my personal favorites, both because they were amusing and flowed well.  Unfortunately, the aforementioned rumble was rather disappointing in my opinion due to brevity and simplicity.  I mean, T-Rex, king of the dinos, getting usurped by a new, bigger, badder beast, should last more than the 25 seconds and 2-3 charges that it was composed of.  It's a freakin' clash of the titans moment.Overall, the technical aspects of the movie were amazing,and although some of the editing was a little jumpy, it fit into the frenzied atmosphere of Isla Sorna.The major downfall had to be the *ahem* plot (or lack thereof). Convaluted attempts to connect it to its predecessors (e.g. Elie & co.)  lead to dead ends.  The post-marriage conflicts and resolutions of William H. Macy and Tea Leoni (what are THEY doing in this movie, anyway?) in the middle of intermittent Spinosaurus and Raptor assaults are basically space-fillers. It made me miss events that happen for a REASON (e.g. having to reboot power systems, electric fences, phones).  It was sad that Laura Dern became a little spot part in a scattered plot that revolved around a little family spat that i would expect from a generic Julia Roberts-esque flick.  It's really a shame that none of the characters ever gets much depth...But at least a few people die, right?  Watching this movie was fun, but painful at the same time.  Spielberg could have at least directed it and put it off til after A.I.  That way he could have atoned for The Lost World . I just wish sequels these days had a purpose other than to pull revenue on the drawing power of a previous work.  I guess that's just wishful thinking.At least the big Marine/Army invasion thing at the end was unexpected. Too bad they didn't get a chance to rip into the renegade 'saurs (a la Aliens).JP3 might have been cool if it wasn't driven by bloodlust and carnage that never really put up (see low death count).I gave it a 6 out of 10 for its excellent effects, pure entertainment value and decent camera-work, and its superiority to the other forgettable sequel.

This is a film in which the plot exists only as a thinly-veiled device to set up scenes of dinosaurs attempting to consume people.  Spielberg's mistake with The Lost World was that he seemed to think he was doing something bigger and more glamorous, and he fell short.This is a movie out to have a good time; it's a Saturday matinee Ray Harryhausen monster spectacular, and it has it all.  The effects, as expected, are incredible.  The dinosaurs are more real than ever before, including a few choice cosmetic touches such as more interesting skin colorations, and little dorsal spikes.  The raptors benefit the most from this, since we have earlier comparisons, but the work is excellent all around.Does it make a lot of sense?  Not particularly.  Would a predator really single-mindedly pursue a meal across the island when it could just as easily return to its own territory?  Would a pteradon pick up a human being without spearing him with its talons, then present it to its young still alive and kicking?  Clearly, the answers to these and many other questions is no, but does it really matter?  This is a monster movie, not a Discovery channel special.The biggest problem is with the appearance yet again of the velociraptors. This is their third bow as the villains, and they're getting a bit old. With some two hundred species catalogued, was it really necessary to keep going back to the well on these?  Fortunately, the new species that are featured are well-used, particularly the pteradons, whom I personally have been waiting for all along.It also touches (briefly) on the effect that an island of living dinosaurs would have on the world.  How interested would paleantologists be in digging up fossils if they could just fly out to Isla Sorna and watch live specimens?  Would rich, risk-taking tourists buzz the island looking for thrills?This is a solid adventure/monster film in the tradition of the 60's and 70's classics.  It has little to say about man's place in the natural order, or the nature of extinction, but it does have a lot of very cool chases, and that's it's job.

One of the main reasons for this is that the sense of wonder and excitement has gone from the original's ground-breaking CG effects.  Heck, you get these sort of effects on TV adverts these days.So there really has to be something going for a film, other than great effects, to enthrall an audience.  So here is the plot.  Stupid step-father takes step-son para-gliding next to off-limits dino-island (Isla Sorna) to do some dino-spotting.  Towing boat unexpectedly loses crew, hits rock and pair have to para-glide onto dino-island. ooops!Estranged Dad and Mum con famous - though hard up for cash - research palaeontologist into accompanying them to island for a fly-by with a hidden agenda; rescuing son. Mixing all this together is a Director whose credits include Jumanji and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and its, cue lots of running around screaming stuff.  There is one good thing going for JP-3 though.  You really do want the Dinos to chomp nearly everyone because they are bone-stupid and not very nice people to boot.Any film whose basic plot is derived from an act of gross stupidity, really is going to struggle.  Dead Calm is another good example (and er... wasn't Sam Neill in that one as well).There are some notable moments; the Terradactyl on the bridge and the Spinosaraus v T-Rex fight spring to mind and one real comedy touch, nobody move a muscle. The only new addition to the franchise is that the Velocaraptors have a language (really), there is a new dino-kid (Spinosauras?) on the block capable of stiffing a T-Rex (now that IS impressive) and we are introduced to some Terradactyls, but that's about it folks.  Sam Neill is watchable and has a bit more of an aggressive, or maybe that's just p***ed-off, attitude, and there is about 5 minutes of Laura Dern to brighten the day.So JP-3 doesn't really make it, but if you enjoy creature features, you will enjoy this one.

However, there are just enough cute little jokes that you are distracted from the tissue-thin plot, cardboard characters, and logical inconsistencies. Basically, the movie goes like this Young city boy gets lost on island - Group of adults goes to island to look for boy - Eeeeek! A dinosaur eats someone - They find the young city boy's belongings - Eeeeek! A dinosaur eats someone - They find the young city boy -; Eeeeek! A dinosaur eats someone - They make for the shore to get off the island - Eeeeek! A dinosaur eats someone -They get off the island - Happy pterodactyls (or however you spell it) flying off into the sunset in search of greener pastures and lucrative sequels.  Very linear, undercooked story, but not a bad start. Unfortunately, that's as far as they take it.I also found that some distracting demands were put on my suspension of disbelief. For example, when they find the young city boy, he's been on the island alone for two months. Somehow, in this time, he has become a Dinosaur Commando - not only evading the purple people eaters, but surviving by his wits. But okay, I'll deal with it. It's no worse than the unbelivably thin characters inhabited by Sam Niel, William H. Macy (a personal favorite of mine, but again not given much to work with here) and Tea Leoni.  The people are in the movie just to give the dinosaurs something to chase and eat. Which is fine, actually.As I said earlier, the saving grace of the movie is the cockeyed humor. There's a great gag involving a cel phone, and an even funnier juxtaposition of raptors terrorizing humans intercut with Barney the Dinosaur. Beyiond that, I'd say that some of the film's strengths lie in things NOT salvaged from JP1 and JP2 - mostly, the absence of truly irritating children and Laura Dern, who is a lovely woman but completely unbelievable playing a paleo-botanist....especially with the sound of the wind whistling through her empty head.There's some nice blood and guts for the 13-year-olds and the dinosaurs look neat, if a bit too colorful. But please don't be an idiot like the couple in front of me at the theatre who brought thier 5-year-old to see the movie. JP3 lacks the suspense and sheer horror of the original, but it could still be pretty disturbing to little kids to watch people get thier heads ripped off by what are basically monsters.

OK, maybe I'm being a little unfair, being as how the original JP was one of the greatest movies of all time.  But while the second couldn't hold a candle to the first, this most recent can't get the candle lit.I can understand that JP3 is a fantasy, and a certain extent of imagination is needed to appreciate this type of movie.  But one can only suspend so much disbelief.  If you want to be one who truly believes dinosaurs can be brought back to life, fine.  But when a group of people venture off to an abandoned island on a journey no one else knows about to a place where dinosaurs run wild, it is absurd to think that anyone will survive. People in real life who are trapped in situations similar to this--like falling into a gorilla pit at the zoo--rarely survive, and when they do, it is proclaimed as a miracle.  JP3 was too much of a miracle movie for me.In general, the movie looked to have promise, but, without giving anything away, the ending was too anticlimactic, the body count was too low, and there was too much comedy from William H.

The tagline is merely stating the audiences torture that they had to be subdued to for the length of this film. Thankfully this chapter of the trilogy is the shortest, but its still an hour and a half of my life that I would like back.This film is aimed squarely for kids, with a lot more dinosaur moments than the first two films, but the plot and the script are wafer thin. Now don't get me wrong I loved 'Jurassic Park' and 'The Lost World' but at least they had decent plots and Steven Spielberg at the helm. JPIII however is directed by Joe Johnston (who also directed such classics as 'The Rocketeer' and 'Honey,I Shrank the Kids') so the magic is completely lost.The main outline of the story is as follows a rich family is upset by the loss of their son Eric. He crash landed on Site B (the island from JPII) after a paragliding accident.His parents desperate to find him employ Dr Grant (Sam Neill) to give them a sort of tour of the island, (as he is the only one with the experience,even though he states he would never go back to the island for 'anything on earth or heaven', its amazing how money changes this and how characters personalities change in sequels) but with the hidden agenda of trying to find their son.Obviously, things go wrong. The plane crashes after a dinosaur attack, so they are left to fend for themselves. Some of the characters get eaten by the dinosaurs, some don't (we've seen it twice before). Eventually they do find Ben (yay!!), as if we thought otherwise and escape the island via the help of Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern).The plot is poor, the script is weak, most of the acting is dire and the direction is laughable.

The storyline was more original and noble than I had antispaited but afterwards felt it was only an excuse to make another film. The only thing that saved this movie was Sam Neil. It was great to see his character devolop more and yet he was overshadowed by continully being the voice of reason but yet never listened too. William H. Macy was blatantly misused for this film. I mean it was a medicore performance by a superberb actor not his best work. As for Tea Leoni any no name and or actress with half a brain could have played Amanda. Waht saved this movie from being a total waste of money was the kid Eric. The fact that he was able to survive and stay alive for that amount of time is well to say the least hard to swallow but also you understand why he was made to be that resourceful.If you are looking for more bloodshed than you best see another movie. The movie was advertised as No Walk in The Park. As far as I could see if you were a character who had more than 4 lines you were going to live. I mean how many people died maybe 5 and of those we actually only got to see 3 of them get eaten and or torn apart.The fast action pace of the movie left well something more to be desired. The 90 minutes you sat at the movie theatre to watch this film could have been spent better else where. The introduction of a new dinosaur was a gamble and I would say not one that paid off. I mean come on a Spinasours or however you spell it. No one wants to see they're favorite T-Rex get beaten by some idiot with a spine on its back.(it really just looked like a T-Rex with a spine on its back). The action sequence between the 2 dinosaours was amazing but could have been longer. It was nice to see the new addtion from an old dinosaour in the Terdactyl, but also the parachute save was rather well one might say unrealistic. You can easily see why Speilberg refused to do this film. The plot and or storyline was used up and there was no new spin on it at all. It was an original attempt to get to the Island but after that it was run for your life theres a dinosaour chasing you. The fact that Raptors evolved and had intelligence is rather insulting yet cool at the same time. The fact that they were not hostile and only technically got one kill but left the others alone kind of defeats the purpose of having them in the film.This film would have made more sense by being the 2nd in the series rather than the 3rd. The special effects are just that and nothing more but are kinda old considering they are almost a given now in almost any film. Dispite an attempt to make a superb and memorable film this movie is nothing more than a good action film soon forgotton after it comes out on video. If you're looking for a good action movie than go see it. If you're looking for a new twist on an cool idea than see another film. All in all if you're bored go see it if not don't waste your time.

Granted, it's not a likely contender for the position of most philosophical film of the year, however it was never presented as being so.  The dialogue may be strained at times, but neither is it the focal point of this film; it does work well in supporting and advancing the storyline (almost to the point of being utilitarian).  The action sequences, although lacking the suspense of, say, the shockwave/water glass sequence of the first movie, do not disappoint in terms of pure, visceral excitement.  The characters, although not presented in great depth, are (Mrs. Kirby's annoying bullhorn stupidity aside) above all else *believable* - it is in this that Neill's true genius as an actor lies, and it is for this reason that I personally would like to see him cast more in movies with more developed scripts.  The dinosaurs in this movie take on much more distinct personalities than in either of the two previous entries, to the benefit of the overall feel of the film.  The greater variety of them in this movie was a pleasant surprise (the ankylosaurs were worth the price of admission for me), most particularly the very well done addition of the Pteradons.  I particularly enjoyed seeing the further development of raptor intelligence (making them all the more terrifying, while removing some of their monster taint).  I also got a kick out of various throwbacks to the first two movies, such as the Grant vs. technology bit, the deja vu all over again open-checkbook advances of Mr. Kirby, the kid's references to Grant's and Malcolm's books, the T-Rex as an occasionally heroic figure, and the closing fade-to-credits parallel of the first movie's flock of birds.Aside from the disturbingly abrupt and overscaled ending, this movie was an enjoyable thrill-packed theatergoing experience; I give it a 7 out of 10.

What could possibly be bad about this movie?  My, my, so many CHOICES!  Alright, when I went to see this movie I knew what to expect.  Just knowing that Spielberg wasn't directing and Koepp wasn't writing was enough to tell me that this movie was going to suck royally.  But, hey, there's always a possibility that Johnston just might direct something good and then we could all forget about Jumanji.  Guess what?  It ain't gonna happen.This film (if you even have the nerve to call it that) was more predictable than a day-time soap.  In fact, this movie is so predictable that I was actually able to tell exactly how the movie was going to start off.  The words 'Jurassic Park' on black.  And then three claw-marks are scratched through it.  That's what I told my friends, and guess what?  That's what happened.There were a lot of things wrong with this movie.  First of all, the Spinosaurus somehow finds its way onto Isla Sorna, even though in the Lost World (although not as good as the first is a hell of a lot better than this piece of crap) it's nowhere to be found.  One thing I liked about the movie, though, were the raptors.  Well, just their appearance.  I thought it was pretty cool to see colorful raptors, even though the whole thing conflicted with the first two films.In the previews when Tea Leoni says So this is where you make dinosaurs and then Grant answers in his quiet all-knowing sort of way No, this is where you play God you figure the naughty InGen scientists must've screwed with the dino DNA or something to make 'em super-smart.  Instead it turns out that they're like that naturally, even though they are nothing like the ones in the first two films!  In fact, these dinosaurs are so smart that they are capable of setting a trap.  But the thing is, these animals don't even ACT like animals.  They act like human beings would, plotting and acting really smart and stuff.  In one scene, a raptor casually bends down and breaks a guy's neck (he must think he's Steven Seagal, or something)... and then leaves his body!  They don't even EAT him!  No animal would EVER act like that.  And I cannot stress that enough.And then everything happens really fast.  The T-Rex (practically the star of the first two films) makes his appearance abruptly, and within a minute and a half exits in a very demeaning manner.  Who knew a fish-eating reptile could snap a Tyrannosaur's neck?  Well, until I saw this movie, I didn't! I also felt that you really didn't get to know the characters all that well. Who the hell cares if they're killed?  I sure didn't.  And the inaccuracies and plot holes (My GOD, the PLOT HOLES!) go on, and on, and ON.  Then, by the time the movie is over, I turn to my best friend and ask him what time it is.  He says  317.  I couldn't BELIEVE IT!  The movie had started at 140 and the first ten minutes or so was all previews (in fact, the previews were the best part of the whole mess.  It's cool to see a teaser for 'Spiderman', and 'The Musketeer' looks pretty groovy)!My God, the movie was only ninety-one minutes long!  The first two films (and they were brilliant films, I tell you) were both over two hours each. With this movie you could have used that extra fourty minutes or so to throw a little plot in there!  Hell, even some CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT couldn't hurt!  Also, the music was not in any way suspenseful. The only time I came even close to jumping was when poor Doctor Grant nearly fell to his death after placing his foot on a faulty step.  Please, just give us John Williams!Bottom Line  This movie is one of the worst I have ever seen.  At first I tried making up reasons why it wasn't so bad.  Well, the special effects were okay or That scene with the pterosaurs was pretty cool and Hey, Grant is in this movie! but in the end I really must admit it.  And the worst thing about it is the crude attempt at humor.  My God, if you're desperate enough to have Grant dream that a raptor is talking to him then throw Malcolm in there!  Malcolm could have made EVERYTHING better!  But then again, even Jeff Goldblum knows a bad script when he reads one.  Who were the three or four geniuses who thought this trash up, anyway?  On the plus side, I really DID think the scene with the pteranodons kicked ass. Rating  ** out of A Helluva Lotta Stars.

They did not balance out.First, it tried to have characters. The divorced couple were very obviously brought together by the experience and the love for their son. They get along now.The famous paleontologist, Grey, now appreciates the young, naïve Billy for who he is. Some people want to be astronomers, and some people want to be astronauts, preaches Grey. The astronomers get to study and love beautiful things from safety-- But they never get to touch them, says Eric, the lost son. Right, Sonnie. And astronomers get right up there to mess around with things, but they don't really appreciate them. Billy wasan astronaut. You know what the last thing I said to him was--Sorry, Grey, but I have to cut you short here. On to the second thing; it tried to have a plot. What? It did? you say. Yeah, the raptors. In the beginning, Grey gave a speech about raptor intelligence, saying they could communicate. Then Billy made a raptor larynx and blew on it to make raptor speech noises. Then they were in the old base on the island and a they trapped a raptor and heard it make a noise. Close up to Grey's face. He's calling for help. And finally Grey talks to the raptors himself to save his life. It's a strong plot because people didn't believe him when he lectured.However, this plot is lame, and it seems like a good plot when I say it, but in the movie it's not obvious at all. It's poorly dealt with, as is the character development. You would totally miss it if you just came for thrills and dynonici plunging their claws into people's backs. Of course, if you came for that, you'd have left happy and wouldn't have been complaining.So, I liked it because it WAS thrilling, and when they wanted you to be grossed out, you were grossed out, and when they wanted you to be scared, you were scared, and when they wanted you to be happy, you were happy. It had funny moments, like Grey's dream of turning and seeing Billy as a raptor who says Alan.... That was outrageous. I thought it was hilarious when Eric was being pecked and prodded by the baby pteredactyls. That was HILARIOUS.But the main reason it was absurd was because the whole reason Jurassic Park I and even II were worthy of any attention was because of the neat-o, brand spanking new, collosal, amazing animatronic life-size dinosaurs that were built and operated. Now it's just a computer. You know, computers, like in Tomb Raider, The Mummy I & II, Final Fantasy, Cats and Dogs, Paulie, Toy Story, Atlantis, 75% of kid's television, 100% of all D*sney movies in the last five years, &c &c &c. Wow. Computers. Maybe it was a big deal in Money For Nothing, but computer dinosaurs have been done, are old, and, besides still being adorable, do not do it like animatronic dinosaurs.Of course, animatronic dinosaurs probably could not have done it either. You need something new. So instead of writing a script we could do without just to spend years animating dinosaurs biting people's heads off, come up with new, interesting dinosaurs to grab our attention.Despite how negative this all may have seemed, I think you should go see the movie. If you don't, you will have to be tortured by guilt. See it. I mean it. It's a laugh, it's a thrill, but it's no Money For Nothing. I spent five dollars for it, but I also spent five dollars on an Arlo Guthrie record. It was well worth the five bucks I spent on it, though Alice's Restaurant was much more worth it.

The sentiment is nearly unanimous 'we brought the film in on time and it looks great! It's a crowd-pleasing hit!' But waaaay in back of the screening room some over-eager intern has her hand raised. Excuse me...but like, who is the main character? The producer's quick answer would of course be, who cares? We brought the film in ON TIME AND IT LOOKS GREAT. Oh and who are you? Oh who cares, you're fired. This ill-fated intern has a valid concern. Who the heck is the main character in this thing? The closest thing it has to one is Alan Grant (Sam Neill), touted as the only returning character from either of the first two films, even though Laura Dern does make a cameo. But his character is still very under-written. He doesn't drive the plot the way he did the first film. So it's not Grant. Who then? Nobody. Hmmmm, a true ensemble. Well, Traffic this ain't. Even an action/adventure movie needs a main character and JP3 has none. Having no true protagonist, you wouldn't need an antagonist either. JP3 has several to choose from, but none of them is any more a villain to Dr. Grant and company than the Storm of 1900 was to Galveston. Spinosaurus is hungry and very protective of its territory, likewise with the teradactyls, and the raptors just want their eggs back. I wanted to give Dr. Grant and those mercenaries some advice The next time you take money to fly to an island full of carnivorous dinosaurs, at least wait for the check to clear! Anyone that money-hungry and naive deserves to die (but not by dinosaur, which would be almost an honorable death). There are probably five people in the world this stupid, but not possibly in the same place.If there were an Academy Award for 'Use of Fog in a Motion Picture', director Joe Johnston would surely win. He uses it magnificently on more than one occasion here. There is no doubt he was tapped by Spielberg to direct this because of his reputation in the field of CG and special effects, which goes back to Star Wars. That's one area JP3 most definitely delivers on. The creators of these dinosaur movies know that's what people are coming to see. In this third film, the effects aren't necessarily better, there's just a whole lot more of them. I still think the dinosaurs looked better in the first two. Spielberg's name is on 3, but his touch is most definitely gone. Johnston is more than just an effects guy, he proved that with October Sky, but he'll need more practice before he has a handle on horror. His own style has its merits and it works for its purposes here, but it's just much different. In a way, these films are thinking persons' horror films, new age monster movies. Spielberg took horror to a new level with Jaws, then employed some of the same tricks on the original Jurassic Park. The series has changed quite a bit over the years, even changing genres The original was a horror/sci-fi/adventure story, whereas JP3 is pure action/adventure. There's nothing really profound about it other than residual ethical questions from the first two films. What's really missing is the element of horror that the original, especially, had. Spielberg took a long time with his set-up. The park, the storm, Dennis Nedry, the grandchildren he twists the rope tighter and tighter--textbook horror--then, when we first get a look at that T-Rex, he releases it. No one was disappointed. Then the raptors! The whole thing was executed with surgical precision and there will never be anything like it. JP3 can't boast of anything like that kind of structure. Like the original, it hits you with new species in waves, only to revisit them over and over. The script doesn't know exactly what it wants to say, nor is it sure what story it's telling (nor who's). The story is troubled in many areas, the result of this being a combination of the best parts of at least three writers' script drafts. A film like this goes through so many changes during production, the script disappears. You just look at the footage you have and do the best you can. I'm guessing JP3 was really written in the editing room. Holes in the script? That would be easy to say if there actually were one. How do you point the finger at the writer when one person didn't write it? I feel sorry for the WGA people who had to decide who would end up getting credit for it (but more sorry for the writers themselves, whos work is only evident in pieces strewn here and there in the film). Blame the editor? Well, no, Robert Dalva (the guy credited with the editing) did the best he could.The actors? They too are just doing their jobs. So now everyone's head is turned to Mr. Johnston. Well, like Billy, Alessandro Nivola's character, he had only the best intentions at heart (and look at what happened to Billy). JP3 ended up being this big, beautiful mess of a movie with no one to point the finger of blame at for its defects, and no one to really take credit for its merits. To give it a grade, I fall back on the one true barometer there is for a film like this did I have a good time at it or not? Yes, I did.

The plot is too artificial (stupid boy hang-glides into Jurassic Park island, ignoring all the warnings and his idiot mother decides to mount a rescue, oblivious of all the people who die, kidnapping Sam Neill and basically prancing around like a trip to the park).The ending is the worst I've seen in a long time - if you've seen Lord of the Flies, you'll know what I mean. It was as if they just got tired of making this turkey.The only good thing about this film is Sam Neil, who's looking and acting better as he gets older - ala Harrison Ford. Also, notice how his hat has changed from the first film and is now the standard Indiana Jones issue. Cool, but not cool enough to save this mess. Do yourself a favour and watch Evolution instead.

But if you can't identify with the story you can't identify with the CGI, except to notice its professionalism. The actors for the most part did a good, professional job. But they couldn't act past the limitations of the script or the limitations of the story.Unfortunately, JP III is one of the movies where I kept glancing at my watch and waiting for 90 minutes to pass. I suspect it might be better suited to video than to a theater, since part of the theater experience is audience participation, and audience participation was painfully lacking during this movie.

I answered without hesitation that was the worst movie I've ever seen.What a quick and painful slide down the road of movie purgatory has this film taken the Jurassic Park series. The very fact that it is now being called a series is false. The Jurassic Park blood sucking money making machine is more appropriate. Why was this movie made?-to make money, and lots of it. What was not accomplished in the first movie, let alone the first sequel(which was bad, but not to this extent). What story line or idea did they feel they could further devellope? The movie is only 90 mins long(which could be regarded as it's best quality) showing that the makers knew they had no real substance to make the movie any longer. The entire movie consits of stupid characters running away from the big bad dinos.Of course these dinosaurs are the main attraction of the film. Yet I seriously thought that they looked LESS real then they did in the first movie. It was almost like the computer graphics have become to good, and to smooth. It was like the dinosours were to smooth to look like they were really walking on our earth. The most convincing dino in the film was Barney( who makes a brief cameo).There is so much wrong with this movie it would take years to write it all. The characters for example. Dear Lord....was I supposed to care about these people? I could not of cared less if they were all eaten in the first five seconds(except for Alan Grant from the first movie). What sort of effort was there to develope these characters and make us care about them? Many people woudl now say that they were cardboard cutouts, yet I feel that that would be an insult to some of the finer brands of cardboard on the market today.There are several scenes in the movie that come to mind that were laughable. Maybe some people were horrified by the thought of a cell phone ringing inside the stomach of a dinosaur, but I wasn't one of them...stupid. The scene with the ALAN raptor, disgusting. The part when the people first get on the island, and literally two seconds later they are running back to the plane horrified because they saw a big dino...WHAT DID THEY EXPECT TO SEE???. The scene where the young heroic Billy swoopes down to save the kid in his parachute...laughable(me and my friend actually cracked up). There are many, many more.However, despite all of this, the thing that makes me hate this movie so much is that it will be associated with the first movie, of which it has nothing in common. The first movie was great, yet now it has being marred by two horrible sequels, the worst of which being this one. The point of the first one was to show a theme park gone wrong, to show that sometimes we can get to involved in our own power and forget about the consequences. What was the point of the third one? Dem dinos are a getting bigger? What made the first one good was it's excellent pace, it was never in a rush, yet it was never boring; JP3 was both. In the first movie we actually cared what happened to the characters, we just didn't in the third movie. The point or goal of the first movie was to scare, entertain, and actually give us some scientific background upon how this creating dinosaurs could actually be done. What did the third one do? show stupid, faceless characters running away from big dinos, that was there point. Oh, but wait, maybe I'm wrong there, that wasn't the point of the third one, there point was something much more easy, something that had nothing to do with quality and all to do with money.They missed the point.

The thought that dinosaur DNA could be trapped in bugs, then extracted and an actual dinosaur could be re-created is amazing. The first film was a classic. Another brilliant film from the master film maker Steven Speilberg (A.I, Jaws).The original was such a scary and intense film. The second film, and you knew there would be a second, was not as good, but good in its own way. It can't really compare to the first one, but it had its points of great suspense and amazing action. Now, the third film (is this a trilogy??) is a Jurassic failure. It's so short the whole film feels like a dumb Fox action show.It has no emotion, terrible acting, and a plot that has been done with the first two, only the first two did it better. Here is the plot people get stuck on the island and must get off before they are eaten by the dinosaurs. They throw in a whole bunch of crap about a kid being stranded, and a divorced couple, that is pitiful. When watching the movie, ask yourself...Do these people really seem scared?. No! They don't seem scared at all, and they just keep running and making the wrong mistakes.When you watch a good action movie, your heart should race and your blood should flow. This movie made my heart crawl up and die, and my blood freeze over. The only good action scene was when the T-rex&spinosaurus were fighting, which was WAY to short anyway. In the end, the film is sad and dissapointing. The idea of Jurassic Park is so great, and the first one was a true masterpiece...it's sad that this trash should even have the same name.I hear they are making a fourth, and they will probably make a fifth. That's what happens when a great movie comes out...they run it into the ground so by the end, its just trash. The same thing happened to Jaws, another brilliant Steven Speilberg movie. To close up my review, Jurassic park is a masterpiece, one of a kind film. The second was good action, not great and nothing like the first. The third, is a Jurassic failure. At least Steven and Michael could see that.

The first had breakthrough effects but the characters were dumb, the dialogue was mostly about chaos theory, and rebooting computers, or jokes about blind dinosaurs and their dogs.There werent as many dinosaurs as one might expect from the title.The Lost World tried to rectify this situation--there were about twice as many dinosaur scenes(although even it used them sparingly),the story had more conflict(hunters vs gatherers) and the characters had a motivation that was more sketched out than in JP 1. And--the dinosaurs were real characters in the story! This time--the exploitation aspect of genetic engineering was addressed. We saw how the dinosaurs, despite their immense size and power, were the victims.JP 3 brings back Sam Neill, who tended to be overshadowed in the first movie by Jeff Golblum's character. Goldblum got the better lines and poor Mr. Neill(who I will always remember as the grown up Damien) was left babysitting the two annoying children for much of the film. Here, Neill gets to do more as Dr. Grant, interact with the dinos of Isla Sorna and come out with more appreciation for the genetically engineered dinos than he had after part 1.Story wise--its pretty standard bubblegum fare--though they tried to give it a few twists. In some ways the characters were more developed than in either Jp or the Lost World, but somehow they were still far less interesting than the dinosaurs. At least in LW most of the character decisions  were directed at issues involving them. The child in the movie wasnt as annoying as in the other two films, although the recovery of lost offspring had already been explored before.As for the dinos themselves--they had a little more personality than they had in part 1, but were not as well depicted as they were in the Lost World. In that film we saw dinosaurs acting like dinosaurs(as opposed to monsters). They were shown defending themselves, fighting off pesky humans with cameras, drinking water, slipping on the ground, scratching themselves, creeping over shyly with the encouragement of a parent to give the villain his comeuppance--much more in keeping with the spirit of a Ray Harryhausen or Willis O'Brien film. JP3 returns us to the monster depiction for the carnosaurs(exception for the velociraptors, who for a change arent quite the one dimensional baddies they were in the other two films).There are a couple of good scenes, namely the Spinosaurus and the Aviary sequences. But the fight with the T-rex and the Spinosaurus was a BIG letdown. It must have lasted all of 30 seconds. Compare that with the Ymir-elephant fight in 20 Millions Miles to Earth, or a similar confrontation in Valley of Gwangi--or better yet the original King Kong.  All three JP films seemed to take every opportunity to cut away from the dinosaurs. It is most infuriating!The T-rex fight really should have been moved to the end and expanded.It would have been spectacular.The ending of the movie is rather rushed--but the final sequence from the plane is really what should have been seen at the end of the first movie.As it stands the three Jurassic Park films have their pluses and minuses,  but for my money, the Lost World was still the most impressive in a film series that had so much more potential than it realized.

Nature made them extinct. Today, their computer generated counterparts may soon suffer the same fate if Hollywood can't come up with a sequel more exciting than Jurassic Park III. Don't get me wrong -- the movie is entertaining and has some funny moments. But when compared with the fierce, heart pounding awe we felt when the original Jurassic Park roared into theaters eight years ago, the latest incarnation is pretty flat. The director of the first two installments, Steven Spielberg, relinquishes the reins this time (he stays on as Executive Producer). His seemingly logical fill-in is Joe Johnston, a man who's studied under Spielberg and who's spent his career making Spielberg-esque family adventure films like Jumanji and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. But as hard as he tries, Johnston is no Spielberg. The action sequences are fine, but they lack the tension and sly choreography that only the master can supply. Spielberg can create more dread with two rattling cups of water (remember those ominous ripples from the first film?) than Johnston can with a whole species of ILM-created dinos. The new guy also has trouble giving the dinosaurs quite as much personality as the ones in the previous films. He's not helped by the effects department, which seems to be slipping. The new Big Man on Campus, Spinosaurus -- think T-Rex, only with a big fin on his back -- is a little too rubbery to be believed. That said, Johnston is to be applauded considering the thankless task he had presented to him -- make yet another fun summer blockbuster about dinosaurs run amok on a tropical island. We haven't just seen this before -- we've seen it twice before. The results are all the more impressive considering the script was reportedly thrown completely out the window just prior to shooting (the final screenplay is partially credited to Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne, the duo who wrote the ingenious comedy, Election). The lack of a complete script may explain why this installment is the shortest (barely more than 90 minutes) and has the simplest plot.Two of the movie's key action sequences (a river encounter with a big dino and a terrifying journey through a giant bird cage housing pterodactyls) are wisely lifted from passages of Michael Crichton's original novel that never made it into the first film. Not surprisingly, this is when the movie is at its best. The sequel also advances the evolution of the raptors -- in this film, the raptors have gained the ability to talk to each other. They're also getting smarter -- they're now able to set traps for their human prey. It's a nice new twist, but if this film series wants to avoid extinction, it needs to get off the island once and for all. The last 20 minutes of The Lost World teased us with the intriguing premise of a T-Rex romping through suburbia. Why not a whole movie of that? (Suggested title It Came From Jurassic Park!) There's room for this franchise to grow if the writers have enough imagination. In this film, the dinosaurs seem to be evolving at an accelerated pace. What if they continue to get smarter and smarter as they reach land? By the time Jurassic Park VII rolls around, they should be smarter than humans. They would start to take over the world and by the end of the series, people would be the ones becoming extinct. I can't think of a more fitting ending for a sci-fi saga that is essentially a cautionary tale about the foolishness of mankind messing with nature.

I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, but never before did the girlfriend and I *want* to leave a movie; wished it to be over; felt so *embarrassed* for being there, squirming in my seats as our senses were bombarded with the worst acting, special effects, script and, worst of all, movie chiches, seen on the silver screen in along time.OK, to sum up this movie... Ok, there's this island, right? Near Costa Rica. And it's got dinosaurs on it, right? Lots and lots of 'em. And the movie starts out with two people para-sailing near the island, and they get stranded on the island. Next, the parents of this child lie and scheme the scientist from the original movie to fly with them on the plane as a honeymoon present. Again, the only reason the couple is able to prod Dr. Grant onto the plane is the same way he was prodded onto the chopper in the original movie - his excavation sites are facing a big For Closed sign and if he takes part in this adventure we'll fund your projects for another 2 years, blah blah, big dino yawn! Well, the plane lands, several people get eaten, the plane takes off, but a dino blast of its super long tail sends the plane crashing. More people get offed. There's a chase via raptors. There's another big fence. More people die and then... the Marines. Yep, the Marines - one of the most idiotic and contrived, hurried endings ever to a movie.And that's about it, folks. Lot's of dinosaurs and lots of people dying. Oh yeah, and Williams' great musical score.What doomed this movie right off the bat was that it didn't come from a Crighton novelization, as the two previous movies had, so one right there should take this movie with a grain of salt. Other factors that doomed it, of course, was the utter lack of characters in this movie and outrageously stupid dialogue, whispered by all the actors and actresses to keep up the Jurassic Park tradition, of course.Each movie is sparked by a new discovery - in this case they wanted to introduce the new big daddy on the block, one that puts poor old T-Rex to shame. The other, of course, was a silly notion that Raptors could communicate to one another. Boom, with those two plot points in hand, the movie was made.The dinos in the movie are by far the worst in the series, as more effects are relied on CG and less on animotronics. The rapots in the end sequence where they talk to the humans was utterly disgraceful. And another scene, where the tall plant eaters walk over to the boat the protagonists are riding on, swooping down toward the camera, was so much worse than the scenes from the original movie. As Phantom Menace clearly showed, CG graphics a great movie does NOT make.The movie carried about itself a blanket of confusion. Why were the boy and his dad (step-dad, mom's boyfriend, gay male lover?) were para-sailing in the first place? How did Dr. Grant's sidekick recreate through rubber foam the vocalics of the Raptors? Who was the man in glasses who sat behind Dr. Grant in the airplane and knocked him unconscious when he began to protest the plane landing on the island - and, was he the same man, moments later, who was torn in half by Godzill- er, the finned dinosaur? How can a man decay in just a matter of weeks in the parachute? How can Raptors on an island evolve communication in just 2 years when it took Humans more than a million years to do so? How and why wasn't it explained better how the boy got T-Rex's pee sample? Why did the dinosaur not attack the heroes when they were shoving hands into big piles of manure (wow, how original, yet another scene borrowed from the original movie? Why did Godzilla (for lack of a better word) chase the heroe's halfway across the island, following their boat for miles submerged underwater when the thing had the brain capacity of a male tiger? What the hell was going on at the movie's climax when the raptor wanted her eggs back from Dr. Grant. Grant tooted on his buddy's Raptor throat whistle, and the two species exchanged a spirited discussion before the raptors took the eggs and ran off. HUH? And finally, how the hell did some yells through a satellite phone alert Larua Dunn to the fact that her ex-boyfriend Grant was getting attacked by Godzilla on an island half a world away and, on top of that, how the hell did she convince the U.S. government to divert two aircraft carrier groups and two platoons of M-16 totin' Marines to storm the beaches to rescue four insignificant people? Ay-yi-yi!!!!Finally, the movie was basically Aliens. Remember Cameron's great sequel to the original? Little girl lives and survives among the aliens, gets rescued by men and women with guns, most of those men and women get slaugheted, Alien queen backs away from killing due to the human's threatening her eggs?

With all those things aside, the plot was pretty simple and acceptable, leaving the dinosaurs plenty of screen time.I felt the film maintained a comparative realism throughout also. Although, for such a hostile environment, the characters that should have suffered a grisly fate of the dinosaurs seem to always survive extravagantly. The survival should have been more chaotic and less predictable, with one supporting character living through with a story to tell, or maybe even no one surviving the uneventful jaunt to the island. That's my only gripe against the film.Expect no surprises like that though, just your standard summer thrill ride (within it's limitations). I'm sure the studios wouldnt want to plaster an apocalyptic ending on a big Summer Blockbuster anyways, or gore their big named Hollywood stars halfway through the film.

A new cast and new dinosaurs also help in making the film appear to be more original and fresh.While Don Davis's musical score isn't as majestic and powerful as John Williams's score for the previous films, it does serve its purpose of heightening the action.The special effects are very good but not quite up to par with those of the first film. The CGI dinosaurs have a `computer tint' to them. The animatronic dinosaurs are quite effective, however.In fact, I only have two real complaints with this film. Where the first film was perhaps too slow in its pacing, this one feels very rushed; some scenes fly by and don't give you an opportunity to catch your breath. With a running time of only 90 minutes, one would think the film could have been lengthened to draw the story out. The finale is also a little too `audience friendly.'

The original is a classic; the second has debatable value, but I personally enjoyed it quite a bit; the third combines elements of the first two with a rather thin plot to create a lighter, somehow comical version of the first film. Yes, they get stuck on the island. Again. Yes, Dinosaurs eat people. In fact, they attack almost at once. The new baddie, Spinosaurus, chomps T-Rex some fifteen or twenty minutes in just so you know the new guy is tough. Then it's run to coast, call for help, fight a few raptors, get attacked by Spinosaurus a few times, play with Pteranodons, etc. Is it enjoyable? Yes, yes it is. Is it entertaining? Yup. Is it intelligent? Well, unlike the first film, this one has no debates over the morality of what was going on, no discussions about what should and shouldn't be done, and no real moral center. So, no, it isn't particularly intelligent. The ending is pretty satisfying, though, and leaves things open for part four, which has potential to be as solid as the first one&#133; IF it's done right. There are lines in this film and in the others and in both books that, if used correctly, could build into a well-though-out plot. Let me give you an example there's a conversation in JPIII that runs something like this `Spinosaurus? I don't remember that being in InGen's catalogue.' `It wasn't, which makes me wonder what else they were up to.' In the Raptor Room, they find small tanks with baby raptors in them. Long dead, but with wires and electrodes attached to them, as if some strange experiments were being done. So what does this bode for part four? We've got smart raptors, free Pteranodons, odd InGen experiments, and an international incident because the dinos aren't all on the island any more. Plus, Spinosaurus can swim, and I'd say raptors probably could, too. And then, of course, there's Biosyn and Isla Nublar, both ripe with possibilities. There's room for more, BUT please, don't get them stuck on the island again! It's getting old!

I don't buy it--the main character, Dr. Grant (Sam Elliott) is portrayed as anti-park.  He loves his dinosaurs the old-fashioned way--digging them out of stone.Now, mind you, he's seen the past come alive in a previous encounter where he was thrashed by a T-rex and ravaged by raptors.  Nevertheless, he got a closer look at the beasties than anyone else.But now, with dino activity rumored on a nearby island, we are to believe that the old fossil hound doesn't want to get a peek at the real thing. Especially in light of his raptor theory--they could have become the dominant species on Earth if not for that pesky asteroid that brought the curtain down on the dino era 65 million years ago.Here's the revised version for JPIII  Grant's in a funk, bolting out of dino dreams, getting all hot and sweaty about it.  He realizes his worst fear he has to go back--to test his theories, to see what makes a pterasaur sore.So he recruits some old friends(like Laura Dern who could have phoned in her part this time around) and gets dropped on the island.  Bad things happen right away and he gets that old feeling again--that while dinosaurs may be cool, they aren't very nice.But this time, old Grantie has to rescue Laura who's been snagged by a band of female-loving raptors--that aspect is touched on towards the end of JP3 with the main raptor giving a nudge to Tea Leoni(rather than taking her head off).Now this would have used the same basic components of III--dino effects, cell phone in the crap scene, etc.  But no kids, no dumb husband-and-wife stuff, no preaching.As for the actual movie--some good scenes but you're never really transported to the island to shake in terror as these computer-enhanced monsters.

Goldblum got the better lines and poor Mr. Neill(who I will always remember as the grown up Damien) was left babysitting the two annoying children for much of the film. Here, Neill gets to do more as Dr. Grant, interact with the dinos of Isla Sorna and come outwith more appreciation for the genetically engineered dinos than he had after part 1.Story wise--its pretty standard bubblegum fare--though they tried to give it a few twists. In some ways the characters were more developed than in either Jp or the Lost World, but somehow they were still far less interesting than the dinosaurs. At least in LW most of the character decisions  were directed at issues involving them. The child in the movie wasnt as annoying as in the other two films, although the recovery of lost offspring was already explored twice before.As for the dinos themselves--they had a little more personality than they had in part 1, but were not as well depicted as they were in the Lost World. In that film we saw dinosaurs acting like dinosaurs(as opposed to monsters). They were shown defending themselves, fighting off pesky humans with cameras, drinking water, slipping on the ground, scratching themselves, creeping over shyly with the encouragement of a parent to give the villian his comeuppance--much more in keeping with the spirit of a Ray Harryhausen or Willis O'Brien film. JP3 returns us to the monster depiction for the carnosaurs(exception for the velociraptors, who for a change arent quite the one dimensional baddies they were in the other two films).There are a couple of good scenes, namely the Spinosaurus and the Aviary sequences. But the fight with the T-rex and the Spinosaurus was a BIG letdown. It must have lasted all of 30 seconds. Compare that with the Ymir-elephant fight in 20 Millions Miles to Earth, or a smilar confrontation in Valley of Gwangi--or better yet the original King Kong.All three JP films seemed to take every opportunity to cut away from the dinosaurs. It is most infuriating!The T-rex fight really should have been moved to the end and expanded.It would have been spectacular.The ending of the movie is rather rushed--but the final sequence from the plane is really what should have bene seen at the end of the first movie.As it stands the three Jurassic Park films have their pluses and minuses, but for my money, the Lost World was still the most impressive in a film series that had so much more potential than it realized.

Well higher budget movies especially summer efforts are consisted of expensive special effects...which is no bad element but offers movie goers a fast action adrenaline pumping movie.There are however one or two movies per summer, with a high budget that will get the must see value...Jurassic Park III is one of them.So what about those special effects then? Well only one word can fully illustrate them and that word is AMAZING.ILM and Digital Domain deliver some of and if not the finest special effects since Buena Vista's Pearl Harbor, who's visuals were also provided by ILM.Speilberg's absence from the directors chair for JP3 was a huge disappointment to fans of the series...however Joe Johnston has done more than a fine job, but rather a near perfect job.He, like Speilberg recognises a unique style and structure that make the whole film flow from danger to happiness to laughter and to fear.If Johnston is not at least nominated for best director at the next Academy Awards then there is something seriously wrong.The musical score for Jurassic Park back in 1993 was one of the finest score ever heard...by John Williams of course.John Williams was reasonably missing from the crew line-up for JP3, he did provide the main theme tunes and extra themes but the new musical composers have done a more than average effort.I would go as far to even say that the music for JP3 is amazing and tremendously satisfying than the first and original movie.The cast line-up for JP3 is also perfect, and the return of Sam Neill and Lara Dern was the missing element from The Lost World.As they say 'the originals are always the best' and the cast for JP3 is the perfect suit for a movie so satisfying and groundbreaking as this.To sum up, Jurassic Park III will definitely go down in the history books in one way or another, it will also be nominated for more than one Academy Award.Putting it bluntly The Lost World is blown away and fans of the original 1993 movie will take to JP3 like no other.The big question that fans are asking is is it better than the first? My answer to this in all fields is YES.Go see it now, as it is best viewed on the big screen.

While it's doubtful that it's going to be anyone's favourite in the series, it should please fans of both previous films.The wonder element from the first film is still there as we see herds of 'nice' dinosaurs but given that it's all been done before, director Joe Johnston wisely gives us more of the humans versus dangerous dinosaurs scenarios that made the Lost World so much fun.The script could have so easily descended into humourless cliches, but there is a pleasant tongue-in-cheek sense of fun present the whole time which is significantly aided by such a strong cast.The one main advantage the film has over the first two is a likeable child character.  This kid is not just there to scream - he's survived on the island for 8 weeks, knows his stuff and is generally more composed than his parents.The main problem with the film was the ending.  It finished just when I was expecting one more climactic dinosaur encounter.  To top it off, someone turns up alive who clearly should be dead, which had the distinct smell of test screening re-shoot about it.Aside from these two quibbles, the film was exactly what I'd hoped for - a rollercoaster ride which is immensely fun while it's happening, but leaves little impression afterwards.

He has reached back into the pages of history that saw his rise and done what all good modern filmmakers do - taken something familiar and given it a new twist. Apparently boning up on his Watergate trivia, Spielberg has taken that favorite of Nixon mouthpieces the non-denial denial, and given it a new, cinematic twist. He has made a non-movie movie.Most cleverly, he passed on the director's duties to Joe Johnston so moviegoers will not be tempted to state It must be a movie! See, Spielberg's name is on it.  Looking at the progression of Johnston's work from Honey, I Shrank the Kids to The Rocketeer to Jumanji it seems he too has been doing his share to get to the non movie movie as well. October Sky is looking more like the exception than the rule. Spielberg has also gotten writers Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor III to get on board this non movie movie idea as well. Hopefully they will escape back to greener pastures that produced Election and Citizen Ruth. So what is Jurassic Park III? Luckily, I spent the day Monday at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California and not dying from a brain aneurysm on Goliath I am here to tell you that without a doubt what this 95 minute series of images most resembles is a trip to the theme park of your choice. All you are supposed to remember are the thrills, not shuffling along for 20 minutes to get there. Just like in the movie, I saw and met other people (we can call them characters if it helps) as we filed up to the attraction. In the case of Monday, there was the nice trio from Orlando who I rode Riddler's Revenge with just like there's this trio headed by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni in Park who we get to know just as well.In fact, Leoni is that hyper affected woman you get stuck next to who screams shrilly from start to finish. Only in her case it was acting in way so unbelievably life threatening to the other characters that their inaction had me wanting to belt this woman so badly Ike Turner would blush. If a films success should be judged by the emotional reaction it elicits, then congrats, Steven, I have never wanted to hit a woman so bad in all my life. Sure NOW really appreciates that. So what are the big attractions? Well, we have the Overhead View Ride,  the Crash The Plane Ride and about half a dozen Run Like Hell Rides. There are parts that were lots of fun and parts that just weren't worth the wait in line. My least favorite was seeing how much Taylor Nichols has aged since first breaking out in Metropolitan and Barcelona, the Good Lord, Have I Aged  ride. Don't get me wrong, I had a great time Monday helping Time Warner AOL pad their bottom line by going on Viper and Batman, so too parts of  Jurassic III - The Ride, Not The Movie.  There were some great visuals, nifty new creatures and a few sequences that were very effective. Just don't call it a movie because then we have to get into things like story and character, something you just don't find in theme parks unless you provide them through your own imagination. Which, it seems, all the otherwise talented people behind JP3 expect you to do with their ride as well.

The Lost World was mediocre.  Jurassic Park III is a surprisingly enjoyable blend of its two predecessors.  It combines everything that made the first film great with everything that made the second film stupidly entertaining.  You get amazing atmosphere and subtle, eerie effects, while at the same time, being blown away by very blunt and in-your-face shock-horror.  They mix to make for a very suspensful and scary summer thrill ride.I think the best thing about it is the variety is offers.  Unlike The Lost World, whose action was practically identical to the original film, it offers new and exciting hazards for the cast to overcome.  In the first two films, there were only two main threats, the Tyrannasaurus Rex and the Velociraptors.  However, in JP3, the T-Rex is almost completely absent (he makes a pleasing cameo early in the movie), and a great twist is added to the Raptors.  Also, two new dinosaurs are thrown into the characters' faces, the Spinosaurus (who even the T-Rex fears) and the Pteradon, a flying dinosaur.However, like all films, JP3 has its flaws.  These flaws include an almost entirely unbelievable ending, which in my opinion, came too soon, the movie ended before things had a chance to wrap up.  It probably won't win the Oscar for best picture, but when you get down to it, good acting, great special effects, a pretty good script, and amazing action make this one of the best summer popcorn movies in years.

After the abomination that was The Lost World, all my expectations for any sequels were pretty low.  Being a huge fan of the first one, I was already prepared to have the series plummet into mediocrity, destroying the integrity of the first film.  Despite my low expectations, or maybe because of them, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  As the movie opened, and I heard the familiar JP theme music, I knew it was already a step in the right direction, seeing as The Lost World was practically void of  the great compositions John Williams established in the first movie, this was a refreshing surprise.  Of course as is the case with many summer `blockbusters', anyone looking for a deep story and complex characters need not apply.  This movie solely relies on it CG dinos to deliver the goods; and that they do.  It cuts right to the chase and gets the human prey...uh, I mean characters, straight to the island without delay.  And that's when the fun starts.  While the first movie set up it's action sequences with building suspense and tension, this movie mostly just throws them at you in large quantities.  The sequences are fast and exciting, with some truly amazing special effects and sound assaulting on you senses.  While the action is great, a lot of about the movie is a little hard to swallow.  A little more realism would have been much appreciated and would have been a nice change of pace from the usual predictable Hollywood formula.  I'm sick of the `separated couple get thrown together under extreme circumstances and rekindle their love' angle.  It's been done to death.  Speaking of death, there should have been a lot more of it.  Ok, so the movie is PG-13, but I don't mean it had to be a blood bath, but I have to figure that if you get all these humans stranded on an island overrun with dinosaurs, they have no weapons or shelter and are supposed to be facing these `super intelligent' velociraptors, you'd think at least half of them would become dino-food right?  And I don't buy the kid surviving on the island by himself for 8 weeks.  The ending also leaves much to be desired.  It seemed very anti-climactic and leaves you expecting more, some sort of grand finale that never comes.  Ok, so far it seems like I didn't enjoy myself at all watching this movie, which isn't true, I actually had a great time.  But being such a huge fan of the first one, after watching this movie it made me realize that this movie had the potential to be so much more.  It seems like the studio has become complacent and isn't trying very hard.  The ending also hints that a sequel might be in store for us in the future.  I'm not too sure if one should be made.  While part of me can't get enough of seeing these CG dinos battle it out on screen, unless this series takes a drastic turn in the right direction, it might end up being nothing more than another Friday the 13th.  I really hope that doesn't happen. This movie is sort of a catch 22 for me; I had a great time watching it, but since I actually enjoyed myself as much as I did,  made me wonder how much better it could have been if it's flaws were fixed.  After all is said and done, the next day at work I recommended it to everyone I spoke to.  So while nowhere near the caliber of the first movie, it runs circles around the second.  Should make a really nice DVD.

One exception, the pteridactlys look awesome, that is the only good scene in the movie. You get tired of the woman in it and begin to root for her to die. The plot is pointless and is just another opportunity for dinos to eat humans. I can see why steven speilberg was just a producer. He wanted to stay away from it. In the first one, Allen Grant knew the raptors communicated to each other and in this one, he made a big deal of it. To end I just wanted to say that I was glad I spent my free ticket from the ultimate dvd pack so I don't have to see this movie again. I just wished they could have made it better than it was, it had some good potential.

I loved Jurassic Park 1 and bought it as soon as it was made available.  When J.P.2 came out, I saw it the first day it opened - and was more or less disappointed in it. Too much bloodshed and jump scenes, but then these are dinosaurs.  What would we expect if such a thing became a reality?  I really didn't have any desire to see it again, until J.P.3 was made.  The very same day I saw number 3 and after I sat through the 90 minute film, I went out and bought, then viewed, number 2 just to compare.  Big difference.  Even though J.P. 2 was bloodier, it had by far the best 'fleshed' out story line than the first and - certainly - the third installment.  If Spielberg had added 20-30 minutes more to J.P.3's length just to add some depth to his characters, the movie might have topped the first two, or at the very least, been equal to them.  Still, the dinos are great eye candy and I loved every minute that they were on the screen. Kudos to the CGI team and others for incredible realism!!  Too bad the actors were given such miniscule script.  It was a great cast; the acting was terrific (especially T. Leoni's too real reaction to too many stresses - even though I thought what an idiot the character was to go half-crazy screaming through a dino-filled jungle.  Personally, she responded the way I would, I think! But, I was sitting safely in my theater seat, so it was easy to be critical! ).  Yet, with all the intense acting, they just couldn't fill in the gaps that Spielberg created when he made them bit players ( no pun intended) in this dino flick.  Steven should have given more screen time to creating real people.  However, I am planning on seeing it again with my husband ( I went with the kids while he was at work) and I am prepared to buy it, too, once it becomes available.

A lot. It was one of Spielberg's worst movies, and here's why 1. It was stretched it out to 2 hours.  The first film could still work at 2 hours because it was a concept few of the audience would be familiar with, so it needed to establish itself.  2. Where the hell was Sam Neill?  3. Isn't this just King Kong? It seemed to try too hard to be original, and somehow ended up being completely UNoriginal.  4. It went WAY overboard at the end, as Spielberg has a strange tendancy to do.  Luckily this habit was not used in the first film.I was worried that JP3 would have the same problems.  I am glad to say that it does not.  It cuts it down to 92 minutes, Sam Niell IS in it and it doesn't TRY to be original, it knows it cannot put forward any good, new ideas.In a way, I am glad Spielberg did not direct, as he may have done what he did with JP2.  So the addition of Joe Johnston was a welcome change.The story People on island.  Dinosaurs on island.  Dinosaurs chase people and roar.  Very loudly.  Hey haven't we heard this before?  Well, I told you it wasn't original.First, what I didn't like about JP3.  Tea Leoni.  She just annoyed the hell out of me, all the way through.  Secondly, despite me being pleased that it was short, it did seem to end quite abruptly, almost as if they weren't sure what to do.But, despite these flaws, I did enjoy the film very much.  It reminded me that sometimes with films, you just have to sit back, stop analysing it and enjoy what you see (something the young kids in front of me were obviously doing, as they walked out the cinema declaring it was probably the best film they had ever seen).  Sam Niell is still great, and William H Macy is in fine form, as per usual.  And the bit with the pterodactyl.  That hadn't been done before, so it was nice to see something original.  The way it emerges from the mist was actually quite SCARY.Plus, the effects are great.  The dinosaurs actually ARE real.  I think. And they roar.  Very loudly.  See this film with no high expectations, and enjoy it.  And stop analysing it, for god sake.3 stars (out of 5).PS.

Sequels are usually attempts at making more money and satisfying the publics craving for more carnage, wile some films like Aliens escaped such fates, Jurassic Park III will die a worse death then most sequels. The characters are a hopeless crew of stereotypes and hallow personalities that are doomed to die or barley survive. I was eager when i heard Jurassic Park II was going to be better then The Lost World and that the character of Dr. Alann Grant would be revived (some missed Malcolm to some extent, I agree - Malcolm would have given the movie a slim chance). What appalled me more then the series of questionable discrepancies was that Dr Alan Grant's character degraded form a brilliant scientist to a lost soul whose bested by a pree-teen multiple times. I was amazed at the life-like Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) displayed in the first and second movies. I was stunned when the spinasaurus acted more like a stiff robot at points, as well as the T-rex, I then saw the poor CGI quality in all but the raptors (who were the only redeemer of the movie). For only the misely 90 minutes length, the satellite phone stunt,Spinasaurus skat incident, the baby Petrandon attack, the seeming understanding between the survivors and the raptors, combined with the insulting marine arrival at the end, coupled with the Pteranadon escape led to a cataclysmic disappointment. Im not one to diss movie usually, but at the end of this one i stood up at the and voiced my displeasure. for lack of plot, character undevelopment, lack of effort on the CGI staffs part, add views of dinos, this movie was not worth it.

It was definitely a worthy effort, but it came up short in many areas. The first is suspense. SPOILERS TO COME....... The audience has little time to build a fear of the unknown on the island. The spinosaurus was quick to attack. Definitely too soon. It seemed like one attack came right after another by each of the species. C'mon.....!! I didn't find myself gripping the seat, fearful for the characters. Right after the spinosaurus chase, 20 seconds later, they're face to face with the T-REX(his only cameo) The fight between the two was decent. The first movie had more build-up to the action. My biggest complaint for JP3 is no climactic ending. No final showdown. The raptors circle them, exchange glances (and eggs), but that's it. Then the characters are saved. Where's the suspense? The acting could have been better. One thing about these movies....yes the people scream, but they just don't act like a regular human would confronted with a dino that was about to take their life. A little too casual. I wouldn't dare walk through the jungle not knowing what was watching me. But then you wouldn't have a movie....but they should still act more terrified. Dr. Grant's reaction to the Kirbys' deceit was not very convincing. He was hardly ticked for more than a minute. Think about it....he's faced these creatures before...one would think he would be scared as hell considering what he went through last time. I thought he was going to hit Macy (I didn't care for William H. Macy or Tea Leoni in this movie.....these roles should belong to more unknown actors.) The plot seemed to resemble the second.....a rescue. Nothing more. Lost World and JP3 both had stranded people venturing through the jungle to safety. The first movie had a great plot. Lots of substance. The second two movies use a little plot just to get the characters out to island for a game of cat & mouse. The special effects were excellent. I don't know how they do it so well with computers and real footage, but it all looks real. The pteranadon sequence was a fresh look for JP, something new beyond the raptors and T-REX (but they are still great). I enjoyed the new situations the characters encountered, like the boat river attack and the pteranadons. Lots of action, but sometimes a little too much. I think the first movie was the best, because it was the first. My theory on sequels is that when we first see a new idea onscreen( in this case,realistic dinos in a park) movie goers love it. The second time, when the sequel is viewed, we think Been there, done that We want the same substance in a new idea, but not too far-fetched (Like T-REX in San Diego) It takes a supergenius to make a sequel better. I believe if JP3 had been the first of the series, we wouldn't like Jurassic Park so well cause we would find it boring. Another example.... Everyone loves Star Wars and always will. I think of all movies in the trilogy, it is the worst. Cause it's not the one I saw first ( I can't decide if I like Empire or Return better). Even though it has good characters and story, I believe if Phantom Menace was the first movie ever released with the star wars subject and theme and with its awesome special effects and action, and then Star Wars came out after it, people would say Whoa..who made this awful thing. Darth Maul vs. Qui-Gon and Obi Wan saber scene was a LOT more entertaining than Alec Guiness standing there poking a stick at Vader. I'm not saying I like Phantom Menace better, I'm saying that's the way it is for sequels.  One of my regrets about Phantom was its lack of Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, etc.....but that's obviously because its set in the past......and for a star wars movie to be star warsy, it has to have those characters, because that's who we grew on. It just wasn't the same without those characters, but what can you do? That's why I hope Episode 3 has Darth Vader, TIE Fighters, stormtroopers, X-Wings...some of the old star wars stuff. Anyway Back to JP3. I have a few minor flaws that I can't get over. First, if the air space over the island is restricted, how on earth did they get a boat out there in the beginning for parasailing? Hard to believe they didn't get caught after leaving Costa Rica or wherever. I doubt they had permission. Second gripe, how did the kid survive for 8 weeks on the island.......very unbelieveable. A KID!!!! I don't see it happening, with the dinos and all. Even though he had the truck and the compound as refuge, those two places weren't dino proof. He would have been dead in two days. Third complaint, the island looked large, and their chances of finding the kid in that amount of time were skeptical. Grant wasn't even thrilled to have found him. Finally, the cell phone in the spinosaurus? They wouldn't hear it, especially from that far away. No way. All in all, the movie was well shot, exciting (not suspenseful) at times, great special effects, and some humor. My only regret about the series is that in the story, the rest of the world knows about the dinosaurs' existence. It would be better if the island and its contents were still secret but to a select few. My score....... 6 out of 10.

Exploiters vs. Preservers (although in the third movie the debate is toned down to touching vs. watching)Needless to say, there are more.The dinos are great, although the hyped fight of Spinosaur vs. T-Rex was too short.  But there are problems.1.  When the plane falls to the ground, it looks like it's a lot further than 16 feet (the height of the spinosaur)2.  In the water, the spino is standing up with what appears to be only its feet in the water (at the crane), but the dino was just seen swimming toward the boat, which can't be in water much deeper than the crane!  While the homage to Jaws is nice, could it be a little more realistic?  The difference in water depth is too exaggerated in too small a distance, to my understanding.3.  If the raptors are so intelligent in this movie (talking to each other, communicating, etc., basically acting like primitive humans) then why did the female in the first kill all but two of the others?  Bad PMS day? Cowing others into submission would be a better way than killing them, doncha think?4.  How did Kirby know Billy's name?  I was expecting a well, I met this guy earlier scene (probably on the cutting floor) where Billy explained to Grant who Kirby was.  Nope.5.  The T-Rex didn't have to chase the humans too far to run into the Spino's territory (unless the Spino just looks to kill T-Rexs (hinted at here, but that DOES NOT fit the Spino's characteristics as understood today)) so any notion of territoriality of predators is kinda quashed.Three were good points though.1.  The raptors. 2.  The ankylos (one of my fave dinos). 3.  The sat phone. 4.  The aerie (from the original story, good use of a lost piece). 5.

My only conclusion is that they wanted to show off a couple of new dinosaurs that we never saw in the first two. I come to that conclusion because besides the raptors, those two had more screen time then any other (we only see one T-Rex for only about a few minutes).The plot borders on cliché, the story is A-typical and the film goes by a bit too fast as well as being filled with a lot of oh my Gods in a possible attempt to reinforce the audience how horrifying living dinosaurs are to us Homosapiens - as if we really needed it told to us. My biggest complaint is that there are a lot of things that never pay off, including the ending. (Even The Lost World had a much more satisfying conclusion.) As the film begins to finish, that's when you begin to hope that the film isn't really over... is it? It seems to have been tacted on as some last minute stunt situation and it looks as though some new window is going to be opened for the story, but sadly, it is the end and that's when you've come to the dreaded conclusion that there was nothing really to the film's backbone and that showing off cool dinosaurs was really the root of this film (and it seems as though we didn't really get much of that either to be honest with you). Absolutely nothing in this film pays off anywhere. Not the plot, story or even the film's core purpose for being made (if you don't include profit as that purpose).There's also a thing about the Velociraptors having evolved more intelligent. Something else that never really paid off either, perhaps only laced into the writing as means to ground that the film could have had some actual point. While on that subject, how could, in less then a decade time span since these animals were reborn, grow that much smarter? I mean, these are the same stupid things that ran head-first into a reflection in the first one, so could they grow smart in such a small amount of time? I figure there'd be at least a century before they reached that level of intelligence, if not, longer. Evolution seems to work in a hurry for story convenience this summer. (First in a Duchovny film and then in a Leoni film? Think about it people.)On the subject of special effects, besides the points where they used animatronics, the effects didn't come off all that well. I was watching something on the Discovery Channel the night before and I'd have to say the dinosaurs looked better there then it did in this film.Good points There is some good acting and some good opportunities to show off dinosaurs ravaging poor humans. I also saw this in a good part because of William H. Macy (one of my favorite actors) and the John Williams score is great as his always are. Plus bringing Dr. Grant back is good for those who found Malcolm (and Jeff Goldblum) annoying.An okay film worth seeing for some things cool, but it lacks the magic of the first and so little is accomplished that you more then likely won't remember too much of it afterwards.

This film is just an excuse to get Sam Neill back on the island getting chased by dinos, and what's wrong with that?  I feel sorry for all the people that didn't enjoy it, they seem to have lost their flair for movies that are just fun to watch, not to analyze.  Usually it's the critics that do this, but this film's actually gotten pretty strong reviews, because they recognize that it accomplishes what it's trying to do.  What kind of criticism is it to say that it's not realistic??!!!  It's called science-FICTION for a reason. Why you would see a dinosaur picture expecting realism is beyond me.  Sure, Dr, Grant is too easily persuaded to go back by the island, but did you really want them to waste 30-45 minutes of the movie coming up with an elaborate way to get him back there that would probably not be any more believable anyway?  No, we all know he's gonna end up back there, so just get him there, and that's what they do.  Sure it has no character development and they're all one-dimensional, sure the plot is predictable, sure it left the door open for yet another sequel, but so what?

How can you judge a Jurassic Park movie for subjects worth disscussing after The Godfather? This picture deserves credit for what it does...entertain. Joe Jonston has given me exactly what I wanted...a thrill ride. A short, light, fast paced adventure movie. I'd also like to thank the director for having the balls to break away from Spielberg's style, which makes this movie feel fresh and almost detatched from its predecessors. All I can say to those who were arrogant enough to criticize this picture as if it were an oscar contender is...grow up. Hollywood is changing, even if for the worse, it's definately changing.

The beginning may be somewhat boring, but that's what you should have come to expect from this trilogy. The movie is shorter in length than the first two; not necessarily a bad thing by any stretch. This actually forced less boring stoppages of dialogue and more dinosaur encounters. Because let's face it, if your going to an action movie expecting lots of dialogue and story developing most of the time you will be sorely disappointed. It was nice to see the introduction of 3 new dinosaurs that were unseen in the past Spinosaurus, Pteranodon, and Ankylosaurus (wasn't named in the film, the one that looks like a tank). There were times when you could tell that some of dinosaurs were computer generated, but for the most part they seemed real. The only thing that really bothered me was its very abrupt ending. Kind of let me down. I'd say even 10 more minutes of leading to the ending would have made it much better. Most of the different action scenes were very thrilling, I personally liked the Ptranodon scene best of all, which is no surprise when you consider Johnston's skills in making good scenes involving flight. One more thing I want to touch upon before I finish, and this contains a small spoiler about the number of people that die. I've seen people complain that not enough people die, but I think these people may have just been spoiled by Lost World. Many people died in that one in various scenes, but that was also due to dinosaurs interacting with more people. In the first Jurassic Park, 5 people died. In JP3 4 died.Overall, I'd just like advise you to check this movie out at least once. If the only reasons you are going is for gore, people's deaths, and dialogue you will be disappointed from in those aspects. But I'm sure you will love the major action sequences and the faster pace of this movie than its predecessors. It's worth a look.

Steven Spielberg refused to direct, rumors of on-set strife and rewrites, and the inherent risks of being the third part of a series all weighed on its pre-release life.I am happy to say that none of this mattered. Jurassic Park III is an all-out action movie with stellar setpieces, high tempo pacing, and taut direction. It is a 90 minute dino-fest, which is all that I expected from this third installment. It wasn't quite time to move the dinosaurs off the island, and it didn't need the scientific preaching of the earlier two. What it needed were dinosaurs and more dinosaurs.Is the plot standard strand and rescue fare? Yes. We know who will live and who will die from the first time we all the characters. But, the design of the film is amazing. None of the dinosaur sequences are too drawn out, nor do they end too abruptly (like the raptor escape in TLW).The animals are phenomenal. ILM and the rest of the technicians have brought out dinosaurs more real than ever before, and they are a pleasure to watch in and of themselves. The Spinosaurus and the Pteranodon (which is NOT a fake animal) are tremendously well-realized, and the sequences involving them are well worth the price of admission.Overall, the plot is generic, but it is great fun. Was anyone expecting an Oscar caliber movie? No. Was it meant to be an entertaining, loud, bigger, and meaner actioner? Yes, and on this, unlike other movies in the summer of 2001, it was a great success. Go see it, and enjoy it for what it is a great summer action movie, with great dinosaurs to boot.

JP III is in one word terrible. Being a Michael Crichton fan I fear that both his characters and story have been ruined by what is only a money making machine. Although the film opens well, in the respect that we have to give some reason for people to return to the island, after that its downhill. Sam Neil (Alan Grant) once again plays the part well but development of character is reduced to running around trying to be a hero. The other characters are merely there to provide bate. Lack through action ends up giving way to splices of action, basically an excuse to have people running around. It does not fell anything like the first two films, even though on of the main characters returns (again most likely due to the money) The film builds to quickly, the scene of the T-Rex and Spinosaurus should surely have been saved to the end. A scene where Alan Grant falls asleep and sees a raptor talking is cringe worthy, and the use of the mobile phone only adds to what amounts to some humiliating scenes, destroying the first two films. The special effetcts try and out do themselves, often looking not half as good as the first film which was made nearly 10 yrs ago. Some scenes are played out nicely, if only they had been interwoven with an interesting plot. The Spino seems unbelievable, looking fake at times, trying to out do godzilla almost. Where was the T-REX? we see him once-although he was used in both the previous films he is still the audiences favourite and was ignored to a terrible degree.I was expecting something dark, brooding and exciting.

Jurassic Park 3, directed by Joe Johnston, takes the audience a few steps into a new direction. First of all, the third film gives of somewhat of a vibe that reminds us of the first. Two of our favorite characters, Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler, are thrown back into the mix of prehistoric terror. The director does a good job of showing what happened to these people's lives after the events on Isla Nublar. Second, the film returns the original idea of the everyman being hunted by dinosaurs. (As apposed to The Lost World being bombarded by scientists and different experts in the feild.) The third and probably the most powerful factor in the movie is the new dinos in introduces. The new king of the jungle, the Spinosaurus, a dinosaur that barely anyone had heard of until this movie, is the major catalist to much of the adventure. The Pteranodons also offer what I think is one of the greatest adventure moments in one of these movies. A nice touch is also added by expanding on the theory of Raptor intelligce, for once showing the creatures as smart problem solvers, not monsters. To sum up, I give this movie a 8 out of 10 stars. It's better than The Lost World, but nothing could ever live up to the original Jurassic Park. It offers adventure to the max and will leave you satisfied in the end!

What were the best parts of the first Jurassic Park film? The parts with the dinosaurs, of course.  The second film tried to give us more dino-action, but when the story moved to San Diego the T-Rex was not the only one guilty of running amok (wink, wink... Mr. Spielberg). Jurassic Park III is a fast-paced, exciting, roller-coaster ride of a movie.  There is plenty of dinosaur action and mayhem, and the characters are there to serve the story.  So what if there isn't that much to it. What does one expect?  The movie quickly moves us through the setup and into the action.  Sam Neill does a wonderful job of reprising his role as Dr. Alan Grant, and the companion characters do a fine job a creating plenty of situations that make for some rousing action set-pieces.  Bravo Joe Johnston for stepping into some big shoes and making a fun popcorn movie that, while not as novel as the first in the series (how could it be?), is every bit as enjoyable to watch.

While the movie was entertaining, there were a few problems.  The first is the length.  The movie was definately too short!  The movie ends abruptly without a final chase or final battle between the dinosaurs.  In the first there was the T-Rex vs. Raptor finale which was truly awesome. The second had the T-Rex romp throughout San Diego, but this didn't have anything.The second problem was that there wasn't a good range of dinosaurs. Sure, they added the Spinosaurus, but it just played like a replacement for the T-Rex.  Imagine how good the film would have been with the Spino AND the T-Rex!  That would have been great.  The addition of the flying Pteranodons was excellent.  The flying terrors had the best scenes of the entire movie. The Raptor made a return, but it wasn't anything that you haven't seen before in the previous films. The third problem were the chase scenes.  Some of them had no suspense! There were no memorable scenes such as the T-Rex van attack in the first or the Raptor sequence in the second.  The chase scenes are extremely quick, and just as your getting into the sequence it ends.  This is apparent in the legendary T-Rex-Spino fight. It was practically over before it started. They should have put that as the finale, that way there was more suspense as to who would be the victor. The ending was terrible.  Enough said. In conclusion, the action was great, but everything was too short.  There is probably going to be a fourth Jurassic Park movie, so maybe the problems with this one will be corrected in the next.

Also, one of the big, albeit cheesy plot points is that Grant has discovered through fossils that Raptors were smarter than they had ever imagined.  So, the raptors in JP3 are now really smart, which is really frustrating to watch because they weren't anywhere near as intelligent in the first film.  Also, Grant discovered that Raptors can communicate, so right on cue, the raptors in this film talk to each other, which they obviously didn't do in the first film. But, I suppose those are just a few minor problems.  The biggest problem of the film is its abrupt ending, which comes out of nowhere.  The audience never really got an epic finale, as the movie just ended in an incredibly hokey way after one of its action sequences. Overall, the film is very entertaining to watch and downright creepy in some spots.  What it lacks in intelligence it makes up in excitement.

By my count, there were 12 different species, more than Jurassic Park, or The Lost World.Now I am a huge fan of JP, my tenth birthday was dedicated to it. To this day, Jurassic Park is probably still my all time favorite movie. Of course there are other movies I like more, but JP probably had the greatest impact on me. For all of third grade I was positive that I was gonna be a paleontologist. Four years later, came The Lost World. Still a fan of JP, I read the book two times by the time the movie came out. When I finally saw it,opening day of course, I was bitterly disappointed, especially because of the ending, but it eventually grew on me, and now I accept it as a true sequel to Jurassic ParkBut back to Jurassic Park III, after LW, I decided not to set myself up for another upset, so I went in, sat down, and enjoyed the movie for what it was, a thrill ride. At times I stopped and thought, Spielberg wouldnt have done that, (for instance Grants little nightmare on the plane, that was a joke, and not a funny one) But all in all I think Joe Johnston, did a pretty good job, but not as good as Spielberg.

The special effects are top-notch, and the sound is superb.  But this movie has to deliver the goods since the first movie was an absolute theatrical triumph.  The goods were almost delivered.  But left you thirsty for more.  There were too many events I was waiting for that didn't take place.  I thought for sure the dino-urine was going to be used as a survival tactic.  And having us believe a young boy could survive for 8 weeks sent my eyes rolling just like the female gymnast kicking the dinosaur in the head in JP2.  And why didn't Eric's stepfather cut himself down from the tree?  And wouldn't you think that if a little boy lost his beloved step-father, you'd think he would have been a little emotional over his loss.  But there's no reference to him at all.But the movie was impaling from the opening scene.  And your eyes never leave the screen, as you feel engrossed in the spectacular feel of realism.  The use of the cell phone was creative and very clever.  And you'll find yourself constantly looking behind the characters just in case they missed a dinosaur following them.  There's a sense of urgency throughout the movie.  I, too, wanted off the island.  And then, when that moment finally arrived, I was disappointed.  I wanted to stay and try to survive a little longer.  And that's the only downfall of this movie.  A military attack on the dinosaurs would have been interesting... Prehistoric monsters versus modern-day machinery!  But the movie quickly ends, leaving a taste that JP4 is already in the works.  The realism, mixed the awesome special effects, and bringing back Dr. Grant makes this a great movie.  The abrupt ending only makes it a good movie.  Dammit Hollywood... I wanted and expected more!

I loved THE LOST WORLD, but thought it took a little too long to get going. But JURASSIC PARK III is already kicked into overdrive before you know it. As soon as the group arrives on the island, it's the first of four non-stop action sequences in a row (the runway sequence/plane crash, the first Spinosaurus attack, a T-rex chase, and a Spinosaurus/T-rex battle), making for one big long adrenaline rush.And it's great to see the underrated Sam Neill back among the dinos. The rest of the cast is good Alessandro Nivola, William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, and Trevor Morgan. The action scenes come at a quick pace, but the quiet dialogue moments in between (while not exactly Oscar-worthy) are good as well. Joe Johnston has a flair for aerial elements in his films (THE ROCKETEER, OCTOBER SKY), and the Pterodactyl sequences in JPIII are quite good. I also thought Johnston did a good job making the film seem like a Spielberg film while not entirely doing so, still maintaining his own touch. Same for Don Davis's score, which puts John Williams's original themes to use to provide continuity, while at the same time adding his own touch to the soundtrack.My only complaint is that the film seems to end a little too suddenly. I was also hoping for a bit more exploration of the abandoned worker complex, and perhaps a glimpse at some other unknown dinosaurs that were created. As it is, the only new dinos are the Spinosaurus and another one that shows up briefly near the end, a sort of small version of the T-rex, with reddish-type skin and a horn on it's snout. But those are just small complaints, and the fury of the action helps me to overlook them.Another thing I liked were the subtle references to THE LOST WORLD. The San Diego incident is briefly mentioned during a lecture, and upon their discovery of the worker complex, Grant pauses for a moment to inspect the very same truck Jeff Goldblum ducked into for safety in THE LOST WORLD. You can tell it's the same one by the way the door window is broken from the raptor that attempted to break through in that film.Who cares if the story is not great? Films these days hardly ever have exceptional stories. JURASSIC PARK III is full of gut-wrenching action, and that's all that matters. I actually prefer it out to the others because it has a great pace and doesn't have a lot of scientific explanations and such that get in the way. Of course, this was necessary in the first film (which is still a great film), and THE LOST WORLD had to introduce it's new characters. But JPIII lets us gradually get to know our new characters as the film starts, without bogging down the screentime to introduce each character.So when it comes down to it, JURASSIC PARK III is a well-directed action flick that delivers what all fans of pulse-pounding action films like. Hopefully this film will do good business, because I'm eager to find out what Spielberg's really great idea for a possible JP4 is.

That being said, let me give you my views on what may also be the last film in this series.First, let me touch on the plot, or the lack thereof. I would like to know what Joe Johnston and Steven Speilberg were thinking when they made this movie. Obviously it was not Let's come up with a shooting script before we start filming. The pitch must have been something along the line of Let's get Sam Neill to reprise his role of Dr. Alan Grant and have HIM go to Isla Sorna. We can come up with the rest as we go. And its evident. Nothing memorable at all as far as dialog. At least Lost World, which in my eyes was the best of the three movies, had stupid cliched one-liners that were quotable. This film's biggest line is Look out! They should have used that as the tag line, and saved some people some money.The acting, while bad, was no where near as bad as most cheap b-movies I have seen in the past. Once again, some of the best acting is done by the digital dinosaurs, but I will give credit where credit is due. Sam Neill did a great job with what he had, and the reason for them to be on the island in the first place, Trevor Morgan (who plays the boy, Eric), was much better than any of the previous kids. One of the reason I did not enjoy the first movie was the lousy performance by the children, not that Malcolm's daughter in the second movie was much better. Both mercenaries could have been played by anyone on a street corner, and William H. Macy was entertaining, but I can't stand Tea' Leoni to begin with, and she wasn't very good here.The effects were what you expect from a Jurassic Park movie. With television quickly catching up to what you see in feature films (the recent Walking with Dinosaurs being an example), they might need to up the ante a bit with the next film, but they did a fine job here. The new big boy on the block, the Spinosaurus, was well animated and effectively creepy, as were the cool pterodons, but my hat's off to the team that worked on the raptors. Superb work, guys. I really, really liked what you did with them by making them individualistic and extremely graceful and fluid in their movements. I hope your successors keep up the good work.Now on to my final point and my biggest complaint about the movie, the ending. So abrupt was the ending that I considered sticking around through the credits just to see if there was more. There is no closure here, and it raises a whole new level of questions. Things were brought up in the film that I expected an explanation for an we never get it. In one scene, it is mentioned that the Spinosaurus was not on the list of In Gen bred animals and the discussion brought up the question as to what else was on the island that did not make the list. I am still waiting for an answer. And how did the pteredons get out of the birdcage? I understand that Tea' Leoni left the outside door open, but she clearly ran through two seperate set of doors to get out with Trevor Morgan. What the heck?!? And why didn't the smaller carnivore (which I am assuming is a Centaurasaurus(sp?)) not attack them when they bump into it in the movie?Maybe the DVD will answer these questions, and as I stated in the beginning maybe the possible (and likely) sequel will answer some of them. Until then I am left wandering...

Obviously, when you throw together dinosaurs and humans interacting with each other and chasing each other, you tend to find big audiences young and old. JP3 is no different in its deliverance of non-stop action and is a step in the right direction of the franchise. In the latest installment, we find Téa Leoni and William H. Macy as rich parents looking for their son who wound up on Isla Sorna because of a parasailing accident. Both actors are so much better than the overrated Vince Vaughn and Julianne Moore from The Lost World. The special effects are spectacular, although the story line is a bit rushed at times (the film clocks in at about 90 minutes). Director Joe Johnston has a knack for good popcorn movies. He did wonders with `Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,' `The Rocketeer,' and `Jumanji.' Yet, he does much better with true-life human dramas as he did with `October Sky.'  JP3 has a lot of action, chase sequences and such, but you can't help but feel like it's the popcorn that's filling you up, and not the movie. The editing is a bit choppy in places as it was hard to follow some of the darker chase sequences such as when the Spinosaurus attacks the group on the riverboat. Still, I left the theater feeling much more satisfied than when I saw JP2. Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm is sorely missed, but at least we get to see Sam Neill and Laura Dern reprising their Dr. Grant and Sr. Sattler roles.

This film lacks the good acting, nice story lines and crisp direction of the first two movies. I remember from Lost World, it was thrilling right from start when the little girl discovers the velociraptors on island beach. The new movie does not thrill at any moment. A movie such as this can usually overcome bad story by providing thrilling action sequences, spectacular sceneries and good special effects and it could have done that only if more work had been done. Lost World had twice as many dinosaurs than this movie and I have seen better quality dinosaur effects in Disney's Dinosaur than here. Also, there were no nice daylight shots of the greenery or beach side of island. This movie feels like a cheap follow up to two of the biggest blockbusters on the movie history. This installment in the series is an insult to the name Jurassic Park.

From beginning to end, I lose count of the number of times I was like come on, gimme a break!  bad bad bad, even by big-budget Hollywood standards.What amazed me most was that I expected just that I've come to expect big-budget Hollywood films to be nothing more than vehicles for computer-generated eye candy.

Maybe its because I just saw final fantasy yesterday, and next to that every other piece of CG animation looks like cheap trash.Bottom line there is no reason to see this movie.  If you want character and/or plot development, simply see any other movie, which is bound to be better than this one.  If you want to see nice CG eye candy, see Final Fantasy.  If you really really need to see dinosaurs (again), rent one of the other jurassic park movies.  Trust me-this movie is not worth it.

This time, William H. Macy and Tia Leoni play a rich, adventurous couple that hire Dr. Grant (Sam Neill, picking up a paycheck) and his assistant, Billy Brennan (played with beefcake jiggle by Alessandro Nivola) to take them on a tour of Isla Sonora.  Of course, a tour is not their true intention.  I found it hard to believe that Dr. Grant actually fell for it.  However, I could see Grant being swayed to return for the real reason.  But that is of no matter.  What does matter is that the stupid people go there, get stranded and, as Jeff Goldblum so aptly put it in The Lost World, `First there is the 'oohing' and the 'aahing'.  Then there is the screaming and the running.'  Let's face it, that's what we're here for.  This time, the addition to dinoland is the big, bad spinosaurus, a predator supposedly more vicious than the t-rex.  Whatever.  After the t-rex attacks in the first two we've seen it and done it!  One clever moment with the spinosaur puts a high-tech spin on the crocodile with an alarm clock in its belly in Peter Pan.  The addition of the pterodactyls is quite fun.  I wish more time was dedicated to them.  Instead, Joe Johnston's connect-the-dot filmmaking races us through several Rube Goldberg setpieces before abruptly ending at the hour and a half mark.  I suppose young viewers will get a kick out of it (parental note  this movie is rated PG-13 for a VERY good reason), but overall, it lacks substance.  The wide-eyed innocence of the first and the dark menace of the second (my favorite of the bunch) are gone.  I would prefer this to be the last visit to the land of the lost.

The characters are better than in Lost World, they're not as stupid.  Because they were sort of forced on to the island for the search and rescue.  The only moron, was the guy who stole the raptor eggs.  But it wouldn't be a Jurassic Park movie, without humans doing dumb things in it.  And they had me believe that dinosaurs are smart, that they can build traps, climb fences, and so on.  I thought dinosaur brains were tiny, unintelligent animals.  Ahh, but these are velociraptors, they're the most intelligent.  Whatever guys.  Visually, just like the ones before this film, the movie is done very well.

A movie must first of all have a credible story and well-rounded characters, then second, great special effects. This movie seems to be gunning for a running sequence of special effects with no real plot in sight. Somehow the chase scenes appear disconnected and awkward appearing more like sub-plots rather than ingredients of the main plot. Not that the main plot was very engaging--it wasn't. The ending was abrupt and affected a stunned Huh? from the audience. There was no grand ending sequence, no great showdown (the last fight-scene was as energetic as all the other fight-scenes so there was no REAL intro to the ending), and major loopholes gaping everywhere!I felt that the actors were adequate but under-utilized. The director is clearly no Spielberg. Unlike the first installment and the second, to a lesser degree, there weren't any jaw-dropping or hold-your-breath or scream-out-loud or grab-your-neighbor's-arm sequences. JP3 has certainly lost the magic of the original Jurassic Park movie. The frightening scenes were actually quite mediocre, one scene involving the raptors being laughable!The cinematography grew increasingly boring with scenary that became monotonous after 45 minutes. The fight scenes were chaotic and disorienting without a clear sense of perspective. In most of them there wasn't even a decent built-up of suspense. Spielberg would have had a build-up (remember the trembling water when T-Rex would be creeping round the bend? Or the raptor-in-the-kitchen scene in JP1?) and that would have added to the screams when the dinosaur lurched up and attacked.T-Rex is hardly featured in this movie which is a pity because he clearly is the star dino of the JP franchise. The new dinosaur Spinosaur does have some pretty exciting scenes but he does not have the screen presence of the classic T-Rex. Sadly, those frightening scenes looked really half-baked. So much potential, so little realized!On the good side, the flying-dino scene was the most memorable and the most captivating. With the movie getting a little more exciting at this point, it was truly a pity that the movie ended not long after that. It was really a HUH? moment. That's IT?!Overall, the movie was half-baked. Half-baked plot, half-baked ending, half-baked characters. It was like a sponge cake taken out of the oven too quickly. Maybe with a 2002 release, JP3 could have done some justice to the JP trilogy. The dinosaurs look great and scary enough (though the rators looked strangely like GREMLINS from Gremblins 2!), the actors had potential. Blame it on the ding-dong who wrote the script and the amateur who directed the movie. A disappointing turn. I would advise you to save your bucks on another movie but you may still want to grab this movie just to catch a rare glimpse of two awesome mean, ferocious dinosaurs going for each other's throats on your BIG SCREEN Spinosaur vs. T-Rex! Now, that's a sight...worth ONLY half your ticket. Still, it's quite a sight.Enjoy.

Great new dinosaurs appear on screen and chase the dull humans with no mercy. Although the script is pretty stupid on the plot department, the action sequences are really interesting, and they are a lot. Not just two or three big action sequences just to have some adrenaline. There are actually three new species for the third Jurassic Park, we get to see an Allosaurus, some Ankylosaurus and the Spinosaurus, which is pretty scary and can beat the hell out of any other dinosaur around. But the amazing thing is that the Velociraptors still are scary and menacing. I think the Jurassic Park films feature some of the best computer generated FX ever, and this one tops the other two. Some daylight scenes seem too real, although there are some which still look computer made, like the ones with all the herbivore species next to the river.There is violence, mild but still way better than Godzilla (1998), he chase scenes are really tense, and the Pteranodon sequence is one of the best moments in the movie. This JP is a no-brainer for sure, but it's one hell of a ride, way better than Tomb Raider, Pearl Harbor, and most of the summer trash that has been running in theaters this year.

Here,all you get to see are savage dinosaurs attacking the group of humans time after time. The beauty of watching dinosaurs interact are no more there. And believe it or not,the dinosaurs are smarter this time around having learnt such skills as using bait to trap the troublesome humans AND use satellite phones. (seriously)! Sam Neill is back as Dr. Alan Grant and he plays his part quite well having done it before in the first movie. The others are merely characters for the dinosaurs to chase and eat...you cannot connect to their suffering or terror. Which actually makes you root the dinosaurs than the humans! There is ONE young boy...something I think is a requirement from the producers...you know,to excite the children, but here the guy is so 2 dimensional,you'd wish he was just eaten up by the dinosaurs. The storyline is nothing to shout about,in fact it's just about 10-15 minutes of story backed by the endless chase of dinosaurs. The movie itself is very short,about 1 and a half hours. I was really expecting more from JP3...it was a good thing Spielberg stayed away from this movie...it would've been one of the few pitfalls in his superb career. However, the dinosaurs are really awesome...they never fail to impress you and were very realistic,but then again...it's not something you haven't seen before.I really don't see the Jurassic Park franchise going anywhere... and I pray to God there is no Jurassic Park 4.

It doesn't take the greatest mind to realise what will happen next.... The best thing that can be said about the third Jurassic Park is that it's very short by comparison with the first two films (around 85 minutes) but it has enormous problems not least of all with turgid and by-the-numbers direction, hackneyed editing and a script and plot written on the back of a candy wrapper.  It's a series of disconnecting set pieces, which verge from humans meet dinosaurs, get chased by dinosaurs, talk, cliched pathos, hamfisted humanism, detacted violence, more chases. The End Perhaps very little children might get some level of thrill seeking from this, but anyone over 10 will be bored, not just by the over-familarity of the film, which is more of a franchise cash-cow than a creative enterprise, but by the real lack of care and imagination on view.  if kids have been weaned on films much more violent than Jurassic Park, they will think that this is really childish stuff. Paradoxically, young children may not be able to handle the sometimes jarring violence. At least films like Shrek blend elements for both children and adults; that takes skill, intelligence, wit and talent which is totally absent here.  Even the poor attempts at humour in this film are lackluster and half-hearted. As I said, It is short film and that will be the only antidote to keep you going if you're tugged at the knee, begged to be taken by your nearest and dearest- the little people. On a positive note, the special effects and sound design are excellent giving an air of tension and some effective shock moments.  Although the whipping up of tension is ruined by the by-the-numbers direction and jigsaw puzzle editing. After seeing this film, I can only conclude that Hollywood is in total free-fall and can't see further than the bank.  It might be nice to see Jurassic Park 3 as a benchmark for Hollywood to rethink their policy on cheating the audience with little more than the kind of short-attention span plot synopsis that a child could come up with. In the final analysis it makes no really difference, this film is critic proof and those that enjoyed the first two (I hated the first sequel) will enjoy being fed the same tasteless and bland auto-pilot approach.

So it comes as no surprise that director Joe Johnston, whose most popular work back in 2001 consisted of mediocre fare like Honey, I Shrunk The Kids (1989) and Jumanji (1995), failed to squeeze any life out of the extinct prehistoric monsters on show. Even the writing talents of Oscar-winners Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor - who co-scripted with Peter Buchman - struggle to bring any dimension to the film's ensemble of disposable characters.When their son Eric (Trevor Morgan) goes missing while para-sailing near to the dino-infested island of Isla Sorna, his wealthy parents Paul (William H. Macy) and Amanda (Tea Leoni) look to launching their own rescue mission. As their guide, they approach Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), one of the survivors from the events of Jurassic Park, to whom they offer a big pay-cheque and the promise that their plane will not touch ground. Paul and Amanda have some explaining to do when they inevitably land on the island and are soon running for their lives from a hungry spinosaurus. The velociraptors have also become more intelligent, learning to vocally communicate with each other, and do not respond nicely when Grant's assistant Billy (Alessandro Nivola) steals one of their eggs.It's no surprise that the franchise stagnated for 14 years following this third instalment. Little more than a re-hash of the first two movies - characters scream, run, get eaten, and make stupid decisions, while the true stars, the dinosaurs themselves, still impress. There's little pity to be had for the characters as we are urged to accept that Paul and Amanda would let their young son adventure near to an island now famously inhabited by ravenous monsters, and then ignore every piece of advice offered to them by the expert they employed. Even Sam Neill sleepwalks his lines and fails to bring any life to Dr. Grant. It all just seems like a pointless exercise, like everyone involved were simply seeking a nice pay day, and any ethical questions raised in the first two films are ignored in favour of somehow squeezing in yet another dinosaur attack.

Not the first, and certainly not the second. Just this one that I am reviewing. This came first just before I saw the first one being brought back in 2013 in 3D. With that said, the movie is about Alan Grant who is a survivor from the first one as he is still studying dinosaurs as he has been offered by a couple to be their tour guide as he brings Billy along, and things turned out to be a set up. They pretty much kidnapped him for his help to find their lost son, Eric who has been missing for eight weeks. So they go out to find their son, and try to get back home. This whole premise as you are reading really does play out like a B movie as you may have seen in any other movies that carries the same scenario. I first once did like this movie, but as time goes by it doesn't hold up really well. I don't hate it, but I don't consider this to be the absolute worst. I say it is the weakest, but not the worst of the worst. What is good and bad about this movie? The good is that it is really nice to have Sam Neill come back as he does give a good performance, and pretty much the best character in the movie. The other cast all did fine, but there was nothing much to root for. I can like two or three characters, but the others were just there. The music by Don Davis is very well scored as it does have some of that Jurassic Park feeling. The special effects are again like the second film, where they are parts that look slightly dated but for the most part they are really good. It has some neat actions, but nothing much to say about. The bad is that I don't think Joe Johnston does a good on making the movie. He did okay, but he just keeps missing on the boat. Also, the pacing is only an hour and a half long. When I first saw this movie, I was like Really? That's it? It just leaves me to wanting more, because it needed more action and excitements. The story is what it is, and never I find it original. In spite of some of the issues that I had, I can still watch it as a time waster and I can't hate it because I grew up with it. Overall, the movie was okay.

Sam Niell effortlessly slides back into the role quite well, and should provide comfort food for Jurassic Park fans like myself and others. If anything in this film, aside from the dinosaurs are worthy of your time and attention, it's Dr. Grant. We also have a nice cameo from Laura Dern who returns as Ellie Sattler.

I did in particular liked Alessandro Nivola's character Billy, but I didn't care for the rest of the mercenaries or the couple who are looking for their missing son portrayed by Tea Leoni and William H.

This time around I didn't buy into the reason why everyone was forced to go back to that island once more. I thought overall, the film was thinly written, sloppy dialog, and just kind of shoehorned in. I mean after the events of the first two films, it's well known and publicized that dinosaurs exist once more so why in the world would anyone attempt to go near that island. Also, going into spoiler territory here, but if Ellie is able to rescue Grant and the others, by calling the US navy and the marines, why didn't the Kirby's(Macy and Leoni) do that to rescue their son? I also found that Malcolm's excuse to go back to that island was kinda lame in the second film, but he was forced into it because of his girlfriend, but for Dr. Grant, even if he was bribed by the Kirby's, he's smarter than that. But I guess money can change people's mind. Despite the characters repeating the same mistakes and getting into same situations again, the pacing is brisk and the dinosaurs are as cool as ever with some impressive visuals. We now see the Pteranodons in full action and they're just as deadly. The Velociraptors never fail to be threatening and vicious and this third entry displays their intelligence even more which was quite intriguing to watch. The Spinosaurus is introduced, and new dinosaur villain and single-handedly destroys the T-Rex. One thing I can always commend for the Jurassic Park franchise is their smart use of blending animatronics and cgi together.

This island has become breeding ground for John Hammond's magnificent creations and a magnet for thrill-seekers eager to encounter them. When a tragic accident maroons them, Grant discovers the reason his hosts have invited him along. In their attempt to escape, the group encounter terrifying new creatures and Grant is forced to learn the dreadful implications of his raptor intelligence theory.....The thing about this movie is that if you take away the maguffin of the child in peril,this is just a watered down version of the first film, and when you look at it that way, it seems a pretty sparse affair, and sometimes looks like a low budget movie.Neill looks tired and fed up, and the rest oft he cast are going through the motions. The set pieces are just poor retreads of the first movie, and for a film that's later, the effects are poorer than the groundbreaking original.It doesn't have the Spielberg magic, and Johnston should have done this in his sleep, but the end product doesn't feel magical, and it leaves you feeling a little empty.

JPIII is simply content to pit humans vs. dinosaurs as the humans seek to escape the dinosaur domain alive, and does so, as I said in the title, efficiently, confidently, and entertainingly. Unlike the first sequel, which gave us the brave but bemused and not dinosaur-savvy Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) JPIII has the good sense to reintroduce rugged, resourceful, Indiana-Jones-like paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant in a latest attempt to save someone from dinosaur-infested Isla Sorna. That someone is resourceful, plucky 12-year old survivalist Eric Kirby (Trevor Morgan), stranded by a parasailing mishap. Eric is certainly a refreshing improvement upon the first sequel's whiny, peevish Kelly (Vanessa Chester). A third plus, at least initially, is Dr. Grant's able, young, handsome graduate student assistant Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola), who comes along for the rescue attempt.Somewhat unfortunately, JPIII counterbalances these competent characters with Eric's nondescript parents Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) who poses as a wealthy businessman willing to subsidize Dr. Grant's research in exchange for his son's rescue, and Amanda Kirby (Téa Leoni), Paul's tenderfoot ex-wife. Both participate in the rescue, even after Paul reveals he is merely a hardware store owner, and Dr. Grant exasperatedly punches him for the hoax.Off the quartet goes to Isla Sorna, where they are, naturally, stranded when a gigantic carnivorous Spinosaurus dismantles their aircraft and slays the mercenaries accompanying the group for protection. Despite their encounters with the Spinosaurus and T-rex, the latter which is killed in a vicious knockdown battle, the quartet becomes a quintet when they find Eric quite alive and quite well near an enormous aviary. The Spinosaurus was the first new angle in JPIII, the second is the eventual discovery of towering winged Pteranodons nesting within the aviary. The Pteranodons chase them as well. The group's progress is impeded by Eric's out-of-their-element parents, and, surprisingly, by Billy's appropriation of velociraptor eggs in a misguided attempt to fund Dr. Grant's research. Dr. Grant discovers the theft and severely chides Billy as no better than an avaricious corporate suit. Billy redeems himself by using a parasail to save Eric from a pteranodon's clutches and disappearing into a stream. The remaining group drive off the attacking Spinosaur with a crane and a boat fire, escape a surrounding pack of velociraptors by communicating with a shell that simulates their cries and giving back their eggs, and manage to contact Dr. Ellie Satler (Laura Dern) with an elusive cell phone for help in getting off the island. They get off the island, find Billy injured but safe, and see the freed pteranodons fly off the island for a possible third sequel.I liked JPIII because it is a stripped-down, just-long-enough, straightforward dinosaur adventure. Furthermore, we learn more about more dinosaurs (carnivores and herbivores) and realize they are far more than villains that chase and eat people. Also, the characters, even Eric's stereotypically clueless parents, test their mettle and will for survival and eventually earn our respect. Finally, the CGI beasties are as awe-inspiring as ever and advance in our estimation because of Dr. Grant's scholarly admiration of them. One can find lapses in JPIII, such as the T-Rex's willingness to leave the carcass it's feeding on to chase little humans, and a 40-pound pteranodon's questionable ability to pick up an 80-pound kid (besides pteranodons are fish-eaters). Nevertheless, JPIII is a thrilling, suspenseful ride (especially the sequence when Dr. Grant desperately calls Ellie on the slippery cell phone, gets her 3-year old son instead, and tries to get the Barney-distracted child to get mommy on the line). And yes, it's much better and more intelligent than The Lost World, and on a par with the first Jurassic Park.P.S. After three Jurassic Park movies, what's left for the putative third sequel to cover? Okay, we have the escaped pteranodons. But is that enough? All I can think of is that unscrupulous InGen scientists somehow obtain the dinosaur zygotes from the first movie, perform some cross-breeding on the mainland, and create new dinosaur hybrids, including humanoid dinosaurs (from the velociraptor embryos).

WAY better than The Lost World","Date":"16 November 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" The original Jurassic Park paved the way for CGI and anamatronics, also bringing several actors to light. The story, acting, writing, and special effects are all superb. An edge of your seat adventure film with amazing twists and character development. The sequel, eh, not so much. David Koepp did a terrible job writing the screenplay. I couldn't care less about the dialogue, it was all boring and stupid, poorly misconstructed facts. Second of all, the characters couldn't be more unlikeable. The characters are all annoying, especially the know-it-all Sarah Harding, and the only ones that aren't are Dr. Ian Malcom, his daughter, Eddie Carr, and Roland Tembo. Everyone else is hopelessly boring and annoying. Not to mention that the main characters (partictularly Sarah Harding and Nick Van Owen) are responsible for nearly every death in the movie. They steal bullets from the people who saved their lives to protect the dinosaurs that tried to kill them multiple times. And they also unleash vicious dinosaurs on their camp, killing who knows how many people, but that's okay, they just wanted to make sure the dinosaurs weren't put in a zoo! Who cares how many people die! And also, Sarah and Nick are always saying that you can't disrupt their environment, and proceed to steal a young t-rex and mend its leg. Rightfully so, they are pushed off a cliff. But the effects and most of the acting is still pretty awesome, and to its effect, the movie is still pretty good. But enough about that one, now let's get to JPIII. I honestly can't understand why people hated this movie so much. This film is a very fun thrill ride, that I loved. How can people love the first sequel more than this one? Just because Spielberg directed? In this one, Spielberg isn't in it, but people automatically shun it or blame the film's flaws on the director because of that. And that isn't fair. Sure, this movie has flaws, but it isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. For example, chief amounts of criticism are drawn towards the fact that the t-rex is killed off by a much scarier and stronger dinosaur. Because the t-rex was the big guy in the last two installments, people have shut their minds so they will accept no less than the t-rex, when there are thousands of other potential candidates. Why are people so close-minded? Okay, the Spinosaurus is faster, stronger, more agile, bigger, and stronger than the t-rex. Not to mention the fact that it has a larger bite radius and arms that it can actually use. In reality, the Spinosaurus is just a better dinosaur and killer, but people feel the need to pick at every last detail, when, in reality, this is an awesome movie and one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. Also, there was one reviewer who stated that it was predictable when they were attacked in the InGen lab. Well, DUH! It was foreshadowed! It actually showed a raptor running into the building! Besides, it isn't the director's fault that the movie was predictable! Again, because he isn't Spielberg, it won't do. I do have a few problems with this though, but only two major ones. * The raptors can TALK to each other. Okay, as much as I love the raptors, thinking that they have developed a language is absurd. Although it is original, the idea makes absolutely NO sense and therefore bugs me more than anything. * The Pteranodons fly away from the island at the end because (The 'burbs reference here, Someone left the gate open.) Although these prehistoric reptilian clones tried to kill them all savagely, and when they reach civilization, will most likely create a nesting ground and will kill more innocent people, do these people care? No. And do they tell the military who is with them? No. Um, why??? All in all, this film DOES have its flaws, but it is still an improvement over its predecessor and it is very fun to watch. Not to mention other threequels (thought it up myself) like Jaws 3, Amityville 3, Superman III, Spiderman III, etc, are MUCH worse than this awesome, suspenseful, well written film. 8/10 stars. ) "},{"Title":"A Compulsory and Artificial Cash-In","Date":"14 February 2011","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Michael Crichton's cautionary saga of humanity's unchecked biological trifling had by this time unashamedly entered the flat surface of bluntly revenue-chasing amusement, the same region that the Rocky, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th and other trademark blockbusters came to fill as original casts and directors began their mass-migration to other ventures. Having accumulated some box-office cred on Jumanji, about a splintered family fleeing from feral animals, this one film in the series that's neither directed by Spielberg nor based on a book by Crichton indicates a sensible manufacture within the thin function of director Joe Johnston's specialty. The idea of human characters has been substituted practically by folding-carton patterns, each of which performs either of two functions to escape from dinosaurs or to be consumed by them. When you think about it, that essentially means there's no need at all for human actors.The initial Jurassic Park was a tour de force of suspense and adventure sheathed in a thrilling present that employed vanguard visual effects and digital sound to totally convince us that dinosaurs could exist afresh. The Lost World, though disparaged by some, essentially streamlined the crisply paced action and adventure, just as Jaws 2 did for its Spielberg-helmed predecessor. But somewhat like that sequel's shameful cash-in descendants, this numbly entertaining film simply repeats the basic gimmick with far less technique and human interest. Here, there's no upsurge to the first emergence of the dinosaurs, they're abruptly there. Character interface is shoddier than obligatory, it's, to all intents and purposes, absent. Each action set-piece is presented in a standard way, leaving no scope for anxiety or dread, not to mention any that even comes close to the Jeep sequence in the first film, for instance. And the entire thing is over so quickly that it barely feels as if to have been experienced.The story, to the degree that there is one, has paleontologist Dr. Grant reluctantly voyaging to Isla Sorna as the salaried guide for William H. Macy and Téa Leoni, an alienated couple hunting for their son, who's disappeared there. Grant, along with his protégé, Alessandro Nivola, almost immediately find himself in the unchanged sort of life-and-death predicament as the last time he was here, being pursued by Raptors, Tyrannosaurus, and the new Spinosaurus. Also along for the jaunt are Michael Jeter and John Diehl, who virtually have Expendable Character Actor outlined on sandwich boards.It's poignant to find that the most skillful scene, a reunion between Grant and his past subordinate, Laura Dern in a cameo, involves no actual dinosaurs. All that happens on Isla Sorna is cyclical and mainly dull, barring the sporadic bald reference to classic Spielberg films, which is also rather sad. There are some fresh dinosaurs at the table, some airborne, though they work to the same effect as all the others. The raptors have been promoted to Ubermensch level They now consult one another, though not in English; I was imagining subtitles. In the meantime our first love, the T-Rex, has but a fleeting, base cameo. The effects, while basically convincing, appear to have been done at a bargain price Some of the dinosaurs, even some of the new ones, are visibly less refined and worse, transparently CGI.This children's slasher flick, this computer-game-and-action-figure promo, lacks a genuine high point. It more or less finishes with a cumbersome, economical lack of creativity where conflict is rapidly and gruffly worked out with the manufactured intervention of running time rations. This is in proportion to the film's largely mediocre arrangement. The movie unproductively fantasizes about reproducing the human interaction of the first movie a modest romance and an adult-child friendship. In this case, though, it's compulsory and artificial.The filmmakers transparently trusted that reprising Sam Neill would contribute a flavor of authenticity to this production that it might not otherwise have had. And, to offer him scaffolding, they've contrived a troupe of first-rate character actors. Nevertheless, since the characters are so weakly written, no sum of ability or familiarity can matter. Considering the bits and pieces he has to ply, they can be pardoned. It was almost certainly silly to look forward to something fresh or innovative to emerge in Jurassic Park III anyway. On balance, the modus operandi has long been set up for this variety of cinema, though it shouldn't have been excessive to anticipate at least a fraction of excitement comparable at all to that of the prior two films.

Steven Spielberg kept the plot tight and the action spectacular, but the drama was sparse. Ah well, nobody went to see a tearjerker, they wanted to get that chill in their bones when the T-Rex was introduced and the raptors came out of the shadows.Then came The Lost World, where Spielberg lost himself in a long but successful combo of drama and more terrifying dinosaur effects. It was no Jurassic Park but it was still a cut above the rest, a great thrill ride that was entertaining and scary.And now comes Jurassic Park III, and it works so well because it's so damn shameless. This one finds a rich couple coaxing Alan Grant (Sam Neill reprising his role from the first film) into being their tour guide on a flight over Isla Sorna, Site B where there are still dinosaurs living naturally in their own habitat. The area is not only restricted but the couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) actually land on the island with intentions unknown to Grant- to find their missing son who disappeared when parasailing on the coast of the island.About ten minutes into the film the plane has crashed and left the group, (which also includes a nerdy pilot and Grant's ambitious paleontologist protégé Billy), hopelessly stranded. Not to mention at the hands of a new, bigger and badder carnivorous monster, the Spinosaurus, who sports a gigantic sail and boasts a huge mouth full of razor sharp teeth. He puts the T-Rex to shame (but where the hell was he in The Lost World, where another group of people was also on Isla Sorna?). As soon as the eccentric couple's intentions are clear to Grant, they have to stick together and survive the brutal, never-ending attacks from various dinosaurs while they search for their teenage son (Trevor Morgan.) The movie really is literally shameless, moving at a lighting fast pace and throwing in every action movie cliché into the mix possible, at the same time introducing tons of new species of dinosaurs into the story that weren't apparent before. There are plenty of satisfying chills and the movie keeps you entertained for its short running time of 90 minutes, but it lacks the Spielberg charm, style and brains that made the first two movies so much more original and fun.

Having enjoyed the previous installments very much, I was looking forward to the further adventures of these characters and the creatures they fought for survival against. Unfortunately, instead of a sequel that took chances and showed us new sights, we got more of the same. I hate to say it, but III is an example of rainy afternoon entertainment instead of classic entertainment.Pros Decent performances from the cast. Moves at a brisk pace (It better at 84 minutes). Though we've seen most of them before, the effects are still excellent. More beautiful eye candy in the form of tropical scenery. An OK score, but the main theme is overused a bit. Some great set pieces and scary moments.Cons Though the acting is fine, some characters are kind of annoying. Also, some characters do the stupidest things.

Aside from the addition of a couple species of dinosaur, this film brings nothing really new or exciting to the table. Instead of a new setting we get the island again. Yawn!

Personally, I think it's a worthy addition to the trilogy. Jurassic Park III is simple- a simple plot, only 80 or 90 minutes long, but less is more. The dinosaurs aren't just more of the same. The rex is replaced by the Spinosaur, who's supposedly bigger but definitely leaner and meaner. The pterosaurs are seen battling humans for the first time- taking the man vs. nature struggle to the air. The struggle is also fought in the water for the first time as the Spinosaur can swim. On land, we have the raptors, but they're revised, and they're smarter than they were in The Lost World, which makes them more interesting.Sam Neill, who starred in the first one, stars in this one as well after being left out of The Lost World. (Perhaps in fairness, Jeff Goldblum starred in the second and was left out in the third). Neill is good here. One flaw of this movie, though, is the special effects.

It was poorly executed and easily topped by the following sequel, Jurassic Park 3.Why is this? Because the logical step, after the studio had created a cinematic masterpiece about dinosaurs, should have been to get right down to the nitty-gritty about dinosaurs living in the 20th-21st centuries, which would be 'They Effing Eat People!' That is the big difference between JP 3 and the predecessors. It skips the whole dramatic, scientific tedium, and gets right into the larger-than-life Spinosaurus eating human flesh, dominating the T-Rex, and creating an atmosphere of chaos. This is what dinosaur movies should be like now that JP1 has taken care of all of the dramatic awe and wonder parts of this. Lets see the dinosaurs draw people into their habitat, and consume them! After 90 minutes I have had enough anyhow.The makers are never going to get another Oscar for making dinosaur movies(most likely). So give the people what they want!

The plane crash at the beginning of the film and the spinosaur attack is as good as the main-road scene from JP1.

I'd like to see a best-of-seven playoff series between these two predators, because I still think T-rex would have held his own more often than not, what with his bigger, more massive jaws and all. If fact, that's what this movie really should be about. Unfortunately, the rest of this movie is a little too contrived, far-fetched and boring. Some little kid gets lost on the island and Sam Neill is roped into going back on the island to save him. Personally, I couldn't care less about the kid. Tea Leoni was fun to look at, so when the movie got boring I prayed for more Tea Leoni shots. Clearly this is the worst of the trilogy (I've heard a fourth installment is due in 2008, which would certainly pique my interest). However, I give it a 5 because it's still pretty lively and I feel like it has to receive a better score than the third movie of the Carnosaur trilogy just on principle.

One should not go expecting anything as massive on the lines of Jurassic Park or the Lost world and the third part really does not compare to either of them. The effort itself has been one on a much smaller scale. The movie is completely devoid of story. As you expect, Sam Neil and a few others crash on the island and they have to escape. So they try and they do. Nothing unusual happens and there's no twist in the story. The ending is quite pathetic.

I was told that it really sucked, but I beg to differ. It doesn't suck, although it's not the best--it's good in parts.Paul and Amanda Kirby (Macy and Leoni) are a seemingly rich couple who hire Alan Grant (Neill) to give them a tour of the island. Little does he know, though, that they really want him to help find their son, that they're not as rich as they say, and that their son is on the island he never went to. Danger lurks on the island, ready to leap out at them and have them for dinner&#151;including the mighty new creature that wasn't on the other island a spinosaurus.(Funny line from Grant about not getting paid&#151;made me think of the first movie, and the amount Hammond paid him.) Grant brings along Billy (Alessandro Nivola) because the whole coming along thing was his idea to begin with. They never showed this part, but that didn't bother me. I was just glad that Billy gets to go. Without him, the movie would've been less exciting.Two or three others go with them, which are eaten one by one. The surprising thing is that Ellie is on this one a bit, too, and she's married with kids&#151;and not to Grant. Disappointing. I did know that they never married, though, because I read the books.Anyway, the main bad guy is a spinosaurus. Keep in mind that scientists aren't sure if they were quadruped or biped, due to uncertainty about the weight of the sail. They could've been that way. As for the raptors&#151;don't get me started on those. On all three, the raptor is portrayed as being big--which they aren't. Deinonychus is.Anyway, this movie isn't as bad as anyone says. It definitely has its parts, some of which are funny. Go watch it.

Kid gets lost on island. People go to rescue him. Dinosaurs on island are smarter than previously thought. That's it.Only weeks before JP3 went into production, the script was changed, and the producers were all praising the new version, saying they'd gone for a stronger story at the last minute.I shudder to think at what the previous script must have contained. Is it possible to have less story than JP3? JP3's story is just an explanation as to why everyone is on Isla Sorna, and then into the mayhem. And I saw it THREE DAMN TIMES at the cinema.

The sad thing is that to the ones who respect the concept that made JP unique originally can be real badly disappointed with this after TLW's let-down climax. Yes, Jurassic Park is part of the monsters eating people genre but the very reason it was successful in the beginning is also the reason why it has lost all of it's true content to be replaced by plain dinosaurs eating people. You see, the one thing that ever made this concept unique was lost right after the first movie. Jurassic Park was about three things in major 1 Dinosaurs being brought back to life with complex genetic engineering which poses an issue far greater than the mere capability of being able to do so.2 Dinosaurs evading public awareness with their mysteriousness when almost every other monster film of similar shape has made it's creatures well known for people, something The Lost World's ending completely evaporated.3 Characters you can actually be surprised by.So what remains is what we've seen before, dinosaurs posing dynamically in front of cameras and press while dangling screaming victims from their mouths in imitation of King Kong. Why is this? Because the majority of fans spending cash to the trilogy don't care about anything else in their movie night. They are the common dinosaur fans, not fans of Jurassic Park as a unique concept. So the one single thing that made the first movie a success has ever since drowned and faded away to be replaced by cheap canary tricks to quote Spielberg himself. The first film was a one-time wonder thanks to it and, now that the fandom of JP's true concept shrunk badly from the 90s, it is clear why this film forgot so much of what the first tried to imply and has condemned itself to be just like any other dinosaur film with no true relevancy whatsoever outside I'm bored so I'm watching this entertainment. And that eats away the experience of  being at Jurassic Park above other prehistoric imitations like acid. So, for a fan loyal to the concept such as me, this movie is irrelevant at best as it's only true magnetic pulling force lies in the dinosaur effects when the story is obviously a cheap gimmick to make it happen when it could have been more. And that's kinda weak. 4.5/10.

By the time of JPIII, CGI was completely run of the mill. If the original had not been fueled by the Gee Whiz factor of the newness of the technology, its own plot problems and character issues would have been more apparent. This is not to criticize JPI - I liked it a lot - just to put some perspective on it. I do think that JPI did something pretty impressive - it actually improved on a fairly weak book. The original JP book was a great idea masquerading as a story - the movie actually fleshed it out nicely.JPLTW was a fairly wretched waste of celluloid. Horrible, silly, annoying characters, a nonsensical plot, poorly manufactured suspense. JPLTW really was about as bad a sequel can be. This was particularly troubling because Crichton's book The Lost World - which predated the movie - is a spectacular improvement over JPI. Unfortunately, the filmmakers took the title of Crichton's book and none of its gripping story. This movie not only fails on its own, but fails massively when compared to the material they had in front of them - material which would have made a great movie if they would have simply followed it.JPIII, coming after the pathetic LTW, had nowhere to go but up. The filmmakers clearly saw the excesses and failures of LTW and decided to solve them by stripping the story down to an adventure yarn. This is somewhat similar to what the filmmakers later did in Terminator 3 to similarly successful effect. They toss in some new cool dinos - finally getting us the pterodactyls from the original JP book - and tell a very simple story very well. JPIII is not a great movie but it holds together well and ultimately makes sense - two points which were sorely lacking in LTW. In fact, after LTW I expected nothing from JPIII and I was pleasantly surprised at the vast improvement.Because of the watchability of JPIII, I have some hope that ultimately JPIV will be equally watchable. Tell a decent adventure story, spiced with some cool (if dubious) science and it could work. Hopefully they will keep everyone involved with LTW away from it and it will develop from the teams that did JPI and JPIII.

The point of using genetic engineering to make dinosaurs is interesting. I think this may be a possible way to make dinosaurs in real life. The second reason that I like the movie is the events in it are very exciting.For example, when the plane that Dr. Grant took wanted to leave the island Sorna, the spinosaurus, a kind of dinosaurs which is bigger and more fierce than tyrannosaurus Rex, appeared and stood on the runway. The plane bottom flew into the back of the spinosaurous and crashed into the jungle. The spinosaurous followed them into the jungle and wanted to eat them. Then they met a Tyrannosaurus Rex when they were escaping from the spinosaurous.The two dinosaurs fought together and Dr. Grant leaded them ran away under the fighting. One of the other exciting parts is the student of Dr. Grant, Billy, who has also came with them, stole two of the velociraptors' egg's so the velociraptors surrounded them for getting back the eggs. At last Dr.Grant used a tool to pretend the sound of velociraptors and made them left. One more reason that I like the movie is the sight and sound effects. The movie had done a very good job on these and these made me feel very exciting. The roaring of the spinosaurous, the scary sound of the velociraptors, the skin of the Dinosaurs and some others also seemed real.

It is overrun with dinosaurs, new ones and old ones from the Jurassic Park franchise, and they look fantastic. When we look back at the original Jurassic Park when it came out in 1993, we marveled at the wonderful special effect dinosaurs, so by 2001 when Joe Johnson's JP3 came out, the dinosaurs were ho-hum, which is a shame, because they look fantastic. The setup to the plot is interesting, a young child is stranded on the dinosaur-infested island and his divorced parents (William H. Macy and Tea Leone) want to get him back. They enlist Dr. Allen Grant (Sam Neil), the scientist who battled the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, to help guide them through the island.

First things first. Jurassic park III is NOT a bad film, despite other IMDb comments you may have come across. As a film fan, and a Jurassic Park/Spielberg nut, my only MAIN sticking point with the film is that the sense of awe and suspense has gone from what the first and indeed the second had. Maybe this has something to do with Spielberg giving up the directors chair to Jumanji director Joe Johnstone. Remember the suspense of the T-Rex jeep attack in the first film or the Raptor attack in the kitchen. It left you with a sense of awe, a sort of chill as you see just how vicious some of these animals were. This is not on the agenda in JP3, the agenda it seems is thrills thrills thrills.These Thrills are very good though, with the best section of the film having to be the 'Bird-Cage- scene. A scenario that would have shone in even the original JP. The Raptors are as fearsome as ever, but the story follows an 'increased intelligence - subtle- approach with the raptors which only distances further that suspense. The 'new' dinosaur on the block is Spiny (spinosaurus) and while being a good addition to the roster, involved in a couple of good sequences, doesn't quite live up to the boots he's trying to fill...Mr T-Rex. In a greatly directed scene the Spino kills a Rex. Very impressive to watch but in all honesty, the director chose the wrong winner. It seems for every good scene that makes you sit up and take note, there is another to make you slouch again. Without giving anything away, Grants 'dream' on the plain,the 'jungle-kid' Saviour scene and the 'ringtone' scene are those that make you slouch, and for a lot of people, maybe even cringe.Sam Neil (Grant) is excellent at his role again, and bringing in William H. Macy and Tea Leoni as the Kibys adds to the impressive acting cast, helping boost the credibility of the film. The directing is very good and Stan Winstons animatronics improve all the time. It doesn't seem like anyone has made any errors with Jurassic Park III apart from totally misjudging what exactly it is that the viewer wants to see with this continuing saga.Jurassic Park III is well made and entertaining throughout. It isn't overly clichéd or delving into the deep and meaningful. Its a blockbuster. a very well made one.

With the high expectations raised by the first part, in an attempt to live upto the high expectations, in THE LOST WORLD, Spielberg, it seems, tried a bit too hard, making a mess of the movie altogether, making it much too long, much too boring.However, JURASSIC PARK &#150; 3, is surprisingly much better than THE LOST WORLD, especially, since, it isn't directed by Spielberg.  OK, so it has the same dinosaurs, and has them chasing around and killing the humans, who repeatedly happen to drop themselves by amongst the dinosaurs, for some strange reason or the other. Well, if THE LOST WORLD was solely about dinosaurs chasing around humans, with a very sorry ending giving out the message `don't mess with nature', this one however, has dinosaurs chasing around humans, but with the feel of a fast-paced action movie! In JURASSIC PARK &#150; 3, the director doesn't try to complicate things by trying to bring the dinosaurs to the city and try to make a GODZILLA and a JURASSIC PARK at the same time, but concentrates wholly on the action taking place within the island itself. The movie is incredibly short, and is action-packed, with dinosaurs popping out from every corner of the screen, without a moment of respite; and before you know, the movie ends.Unlike THE LOST WORLD, the straightforwardness of JURASSIC PARK &#150; 3 is what makes it a highly viewable movie. There are however, certain things, which this movie could have carried on from THE LOST WORLD, like JEFF GOLDBLUM, and his sarcasms, reeking with pessimism.  The movie is packed with action from the first scene to the last, without trying too hard to be intelligent. Since it doesn't try to achieve much, but only try to entertain, it is short, and makes the viewer want for more.Rating 7/10   "}{"Title":"As a fan of the series, I wasn't disappointed.","Date":"15 July 2003","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Jurassic Park 3 (JP3) is part of a welcome trend among recent popcorn movies that they are not one minute longer than they absolutely have to be.  In 2002, neither The Scorpion King nor Men in Black II ran longer than 90 minutes, so the tendency is becoming particularly prevalent among sequels.The compact running time of JP3 contributes to its strength, because as the third movie in a series about people struggling to survive close encounters with man-eating dinosaurs, it doesn't have anything new to say, and the filmmakers were honest enough to avoid pretending that they had more than 90 minutes' worth of ideas for it.In such a short movie, there's obviously not much time for character development, but even so I like the early scenes that show how Neill's Grant character has changed since the first JP movie the scene in which he tells Dern (as Sattler) I'm the last of my breed is strangely touching, and one of the movie's biggest laughs comes when he prepares to answer questions after his lecture and causes most of the raised hands to disappear by saying Does anyone have a question that is NOT related to Jurassic Park?I'm especially glad that Neill was able to reprise his Grant character from JP because his subsequent career has been disappointing, ranging from mediocre movies (In the Mouth of Madness) to unforgettably awful ones (Event Horizon).  He's in fine form in JP3, giving a performance perfectly suited to the material I love his deranged yet tongue-in-cheek smile when he says Either way, we probably won't get off this island alive, as well as the priceless look of fear on his face when he realizes at one point that he's surrounded by velociraptor eggs.William H. Macy and the late Michael Jeter are the other two cast members whose performances are so entertaining that they make the movie worth seeing despite its indefensibly ridiculous story.  Macy's character is reminiscent of his career-making role in Fargo, and there's even a hilarious scene in JP3 in which the other characters realize that he's been lying to them, and when he grasps the situation he awkwardly tries to talk his way out of it in the same manner that his Fargo character might have done.Jeter's character does little besides wisecrack, but he does it flawlessly he was a solid supporting actor and we will miss him.As I mentioned, the story is noticeably weak, but even so I don't fully understand all the negative comments for JP3 because when I first saw it in the theater the flaws in the script hardly mattered.  The dinosaur sequences really deliver the expected thrills when I first saw the spinosaurus attack on the airplane, I was a little amazed by how intense, well-directed and superbly edited it is.  In fact, I'm impressed by it no matter how many times I see it.Obviously, people have a right to dislike this movie, but some comments dislike it for reasons that I simply don't understand.  Some have complained about the acting, which I don't understand because as I said Neill, Macy and Jeter are all solid and appear to have had a good time making this movie.Joe Johnston was the ideal candidate to direct this movie in lieu of Spielberg because he tends toward movies which consist largely of characters running from special effects, such as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Jumanji. I believe he did as good a job directing this movie as any other director could have done (even Spielberg himself), so I don't agree with people who say that the movie is badly directed.This movie really pleases the kid inside me, because in many respects it's a deliberate throwback to the B-level dinosaur movies of the pre-JP era indeed, JP3 is closer in spirit to the original King Kong and virtually every B-movie dinosaur-adventure made before the era of blockbusters and CG effects, than it is to Jurassic Park.  None of the earlier movies necessarily had the same plot (desperate parents trying to rescue their kid from a dinosaur-infested island), but any of them COULD have had the exact same plot as JP3, and many of them were similar anyway.So JP3 is a worthy sequel because it brings the series full-circle in a very interesting way in the first JP, Spielberg was consciously trying to make a new kind of dinosaur movie that depicted dinosaurs as animals rather than monsters, and depicted a plausible scenario whereby they could exist in the modern age.  After the tongue-in-cheek transition of JP2, JP3 is a complete regression to the dinosaur movies of the 1950s, with a ridiculous scenario and the dinosaurs serving merely as larger-than-life movie monsters.This doesn't mean that JP3 is great cinema, exactly, but when a movie is as fun as this one the regression should be cause for appreciation rather than contempt.Several people have complained about the contrived ending, but I like it for a couple of reasons.  First, it's similar to the actual ending of Crichton's JP novel (more so than the first JP movie), especially because it provides the setup for yet another sequel!Second, JP3 doesn't occur in what I call the Real World it's a fantasy-adventure.  Even if movies are still bound by certain rules, I'm occasionally amused by one that cheerfully tosses credibility aside at the end.  Because of plot devices like the one in JP3, the phrase deus ex machina (hopefully everyone knows what that is) still has relevance.So JP3 isn't exceptional, but it works as an old-fashioned B-movie adventure and a guilty pleasure, so the flaws in the script hardly matter.  In fact, I'll go see a fourth JP movie on the big screen if it's ever made, even if the same director and writers who made JP3 are credited for it.  What can I say?  I'm a fan.Rating 7 (It's lots of fun, worth at least one viewing.)

Joe Jonston did a good job with what he had. The script was ok, but it was written at the last minute. Some of the acting is good, but some isn't. Sam Neill is always great.

Leoni was ok, but she seemes a little out of place as did Michael jeter. The supprting cast was good, but some were not even given enough time to prove themselves. The plot is paper thin and 84 minutes(without credits) is short for A jurassic Park. But it is the perfect summer popcorn movie. Action, adventure, and a little darkness help the movie.

If you like one and two, give it a shot, you'll either love it or hate it. Recently Spielberg has been talking of Jurassic IV having an incredible base story.

However, their real goal is to land and try and find their young son who was lost there 8 weeks earlier in a parasailing incident. They land, but crash upon takeoff, trying to evade a T-Rex.That all happens quickly, and the rest of the film is to see if they can avoid being eaten, see if they can find their son, and see if they can somehow make it to the ocean. Not everyone survives, but the 5 principal characters do. This Jurassic Park film introduces several new dinosaurs, and the Raptors are smart enough to plan and communicate with each other. We see flying dinos for the first time.The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and I don't think we the viewing audience should take it seriously either.  After all, we know that having an island of dinosaurs in 2000 is impossible, so the whole thing is just a big fantasy. Retrieving the cell phone in a pile of dino dung!

As I have found almost uniformly with other DVDs, the Dolby track is much more aggressive in the subwoofer channel. In fact, during the dinosaur fight in chapter 6, the sound levels at my listening position often got as high as 92 to 95 dB, and the subwoofer bottomed a number of times.  The same chapter in DTS, at the same receiver volume setting, had peak volume levels of about 88 to 90 dB. This means the Dolby track had four times the signal going to the subwoofer. This is too much.  The DTS track sounded more natural.The DVD has a number of interesting extras, the ones I found most interesting were the behind-the-scenes making of footage.

The second one was disappointing, cluttered with big-name hunters and a tacked-on, badly directed San Diego finale. The first was good, a little corny in spots, yet there are some dinosaur scenes (not enough of them) that are phony the reclined animiatronic Triceratops, and the Brachisaurs in a night scene. Jurassic Park lll retains the best actors from the first, Sam Neill, seasoned, earnest and looking fine, as well as, in a smaller role, Laura Dern, whose character is refreshingly NOT married to Neill's. Shanghaied into returning to the second island by a concerned couple (Tea Leoni and William Macy), they are once again chased by bizarre creatures. There are many brilliantly executed set-pieces, photographed in realistic CGI to a pulsating score and with only a few cornball conversations; the direction is great.  In between the mayhem are scenes of great visual beauty as we view some gigantic, spreckled Diplodicuses and other beautifully rendered creatures - no phony-looking ones here. Even the opening credits are very imaginative. The ending opens it up for a fourth in the series - hope it happens!

Sam Neil is excellent as his performance as Grant (again) and the dinosaurs as majestic as in the first. Lost World was more of 'Jurassic Park as Carnosaur 4' with little to emphasize on the dinosaurs (particularly the raptors that merely popped up in long grass and eat baddies, why Spielberg made it I don't know). There were also more 'beauty' scenes in this one (eg Brachiosaurs exiting the lake in the original) which is a bonus. I heavily recommend this to anyone with kids age 10-15.

Still, if I were to pick one of the three as being the most together, I'd pick this third installment.  It's around 90 minutes long, and this has two positive (and one negative)effects.  First, I'd classify JP movies as adventure, rather than horror movies or even sci-fi. As such, good adventure movies benefit from a fast pace.  Let's face it; the plot holes inherent in such a genre are more easily swallowed when the movie comes at you at breakneck speed (case in point; just about ANY Nick Cage action movie!) Second, the movie has less time to get bogged down in romance or 'revealing character features,' and again --- in action movies, this is a good thing. Action movie characters, by their very nature, need to be archetypal (that is basic.)  Too much characterization is actually a bad thing!  But there is one problem with JPIII that is length-related; the ending is truncated. It's in keeping with the rest of the movie, but it did leave me somewhat dissatisfied. Still, this movie was a fun romp; a great movie to chow down on popcorn and take an emotional roller-coaster ride.  Oh, and while there's plenty of suspense, there's little gore, so if the six- to eight-year-olds can handle the suspense, at least they won't be having nightmares, most likely.  Enjoy!

Some guy must have said, Yeah, have some kid lost on an island populated by dinosaurs, and have a group of people look for him, oh yeah, we can get that guy...what's his name...Sam Neill that did the first film.  He can go with them.  Essentially, that is the crux of Jurassic Park III. Hovering just around ninety minutes, the film has so little to offer in original storytelling.  I mean, you know with a film like this you are going to get certain cliches, scenes, etc..., but this story was just so empty from the start.  The script, which was also the biggest flaw with Jurassic Park  The Lost World, is, to use a cliche, weak as water.  The script for the first film was very good.  It explained the scientific possibilities of dinosaurs living in a modern world, etc...  It had more than one plot strand going on at one time.  The second sequel, and this one, shamelessly try to push one story to its limits...and each story has very definite limits.  What's wrong with making the film a little more complicated in terms of plot.  Audiences are not as stupid as to not be able to follow more than one line of thought and action.  How bout having a film that DOESN'T have a child protagonist.  There's a thought! So much could be done with the technology and scope of these projects if they were just utilized in a more sophisticated story.  Yeah, okay I know people expect people to be killed(not much of that in Jurassic Park III by the way), but how about showing something other than killer instincts of dinosaurs.  Wow!  That would be a concept!  Well, enough of my sermonizing about the film industry treating audiences like ninth graders without minds.  There are some good things about Jurassic Park III.   Hmmm...let's see...yes, Sam Neill does a pretty good job again(the rest of the cast sucks...sorry for my frankness!).  Tea Leoni and Bill Macy are excrutiatingly bad as the parents of the kid who can survive eight weeks alone, untrained on the island when experts are killed off in seconds after landing!  Laura Dern has a brief cameo with little to do really except look real nice in a very tight pair of jeans.  The talents of Michael Jeter are wasted in his thankless role.  The special effects are good, and at least in this film, a wide variety of dinosaurs are shown(not just the T-Rex and the raptors).  In fact, the best part of the film is the encounter with the Pterodactyls.  They are impressive.  The film is not real bad, nor real boring...just very, very, very disappointing.

The fact that Speilberg had backed out was the main thing for me.  In fact, before the trailers began to roll, I had a conversation with my freind about how bad the movie was going to be.The whole movie has little lapses that we, the stupid moviegoers, are expected to simply overlook.  The Spinosaurus is the villian , if you will, of the film.  It's the biggest, baddest carnivore out there.  So then why haven't we seen it in any of the other films?  OK, maybe it wasn't in part one because it wasn't popular enough to gain commercial success of the park.  But in The Lost World, where the team walked all over the island, there is no excuse as to why we hadn't seen it before.  The writers try to excuse it by having the characters notice that the Spinosaurus wasn't on the original list.  Grant says hmmm, make you wonder what else InGen has been up to.  And they leave it at that.  Any decent movie with a plausible plot would have come back to that point and developed it later.  It's obvious that they knew it was a plot gap and were trying to subtley excuse it.Also, there is a decent scene involving the pteradactyls, which escape into the free world. The closing scene shows them, finally free from their prison, finding a new home.  Why is this a flaw?  Because the final shot of The Lost World shows a free Pteradactl!!!!!  This is an insult to anyone who has seen the second film.  How could they have done this?Also, Tea Leoni, amongst other characters, is just a plain moron.  She spends the first half of the film, fully well knowing that she's in an island inhabited by some of the deadliest hunters ever to walk the face of the eart, yelling and calling into the woods.There are some good moments in the film.

The first two in my book,were excellent,but in this third installment(and lets hope they don't make another one),it lost the intensity of the original,but the dinos in this one are much more meaner and very dangerous. Even though this film runs no more than 90 to 93 minutes,and it is much shorter. By the way,didn't they learn there lesson in the first two installments not to go into territory that was already inhabited by blood hungry lizards who didn't like humans to interact with them? Well,in this one an estranged mom and dad inexplicably sends their 14 year-old son to paraglide too close to the island where the dinos roam (what were they thinking?),and naturally the kid lands there,and-in a ruse equally hard to swallow idiotic parents(played by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) into tricking Sam Neill's crusty Dr. Alan Grant and his assistant Laura Dern(from the first film) back to the site of Jurassic Park. Here cool-looking pterandons and a gigantic sea creature which scared the heck out of me,finally get their day as well as the return of those no good raptors. However,the human characters here are so dull and stupid that its really rooting for the dinos who make lunch meat out of there prey. Baaically another theme park ride for the summer to keep audiences in their seat and to scare the wits out of them. The only that was missing here is Jeff Goldblum,in my opinion which could have gave the film some comical relief. Spielburg serves as producer here,giving the directoral stuff to long time protege Joe Johnston,and for the musical score,I'm like where was John Williams when we need him the most? However,the compsoer Don Davis did an excellent job here,but the film itself could have been better. By the way,lets hope they don't make a TV series here,because there is a Lost World already made for the small screen.

The original JP was a modern film classic, like Jaws, that was not written with the intent of a sequel. So, any attempt at a sequel will appear to fall short.  However, when you look at this film on its own, it is a very enjoyable action film, with plenty of cool dinosaurs to keep audiences wowed.Like the previous two films, this films puts a group of people in the midst of a dinosaur infested island.  However, this installment comes across less preachy than JP2, owing to the fact that Jeff Goldblum (Ian Malcom) is absent from the cast.  Instead, this film focuses more on the dinosaur's social behavior (specifically the raptors).The way the dinosaurs were handled in this film, specifically the raptors, will make dinosaur fans happy.  After the dumbed-down dinos in JP2, it was nice to see intelligent raptors again.The plot of this film is somewhat linear, and predictable in places. This does not interfere with the enjoyment, since the action sequences are incredible, and there is a good amount of comedy worked in.JP3 follows the pattern of previous JP movies when it comes to which dinos to show.  Give the audience some glimpses of the herbivores, but put primarily carnivores on screen.  The aforementioned raptors play a large roll, as does a new JP dino, the spinosaurus.Bottom line this is a formula movie.  If you are wanting plot twists and a deep message, this movie won't be for you.  But, if you are just wanting a fun summer movie, watch JP3.

It gets a lot of flack and deservedly so, the film is a poor excuse to get another film in the theatres to make money. Let's look at the reason they go back to the island. A couple trick the poor Dr. Grant into going back to the island. He thinks they are flying over it, when in reality they land on the island to look for their son who has disappeared on it. Start the dino attacks.This film is famous for two things, one is the Spinosaurus, the so called new king of the jungle. We are given a small useless fight scene between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex to prove this point. Ram it down out throats, we get it a new dinosaur that is more dangerous. The second would be the Pterodons stuck in their bird cage. An exciting sequence yes, but something small that is stuck in a ridiculous film. Given that the point of this film is really useless, I like to look at it as a simple popcorn flick that serves no purpose other than to give the viewer a decent time at the theatre. The first two were at least based on books. The film does give decent chase sequences but we don't care for the characters other than Grant, from the first one. How the kid survived is a brain teaser. He'd be dead in reality, also how the boat they were parasailing on was destroyed and the crew killed is a plot hole to me. There are theories, but to me it's just lazy writing.Jurassic Park 3 is a short film too, they basically arrive on the island, find the kid, then leave. The sense of adventure is lessened in this one than the previous two. The stakes aren't as high and the new dinosaur is pretty much a yawn. This is the obvious weakest entry in the series which I guess makes me appreciate even the weaker Spielberg films even more.

He's still studying the theory on how Velociraptors work and communicate together and considers all the dinosaurs he encountered on the trip from the theme park to be genetic monsters rather than animals. He meets with an entrepreneur (William H.

The animatronics were also a little less than the ones in the predecessors. I didn't really like the revamped designs either. Sure, it's nice to keep your dinosaurs up-to-date to new scientific discoveries, but not when it contradicts the previous movies! The plot wasn't really as interesting either, overall the movie felt too small-scaled in comparison to its predecessors. I felt that the running time was too short, too.Now, there are also plenty of good things about JPIII. I liked to see Grant and Ellie again. The Spinosaurus, though unnecessary- they mistakenly thought the audience had grown tired of the good ol' T.rex- was an interesting and refreshing new addition, and the Spino/T.rex battle was nice. It wasn't overdone or stylized, which was good. Although in the end it was a bit unrealistic that the Rex's bone-crushing bite didn't kill the Spino. The aviary scene was definitely the height-point of the movie, it was well-directed and exciting.Aside from a not-so-great script, I think some of the bad things can be attributed to Steven Spielberg not directing. I know he doesn't always make good movies (never really cared for Hook), but I think JPIII would have been better than it is with Stevie in the director's chair rather than the producer's.

That's what these films are about, after all. if you want a treatise on the dangers of genetic tampering, read the books instead. At least with this second sequel, the &#145;plot' has been kept deliberately threadbare, letting the film flow from one action scene to another, unlike the ponderous pace of The Lost World.I couldn't hear most of the exposition at the beginning of the film due to all the kids chattering in the theatre. They just wanted to see the dinos, and so did I. Thankfully, character development is kept to a minimum, and we're thrust back onto Site B in no time. In a throwback to the original book, we get Pteranodons this time round (the technology and budget obviously stretches to flying dinos now), and this section of the film is inventive and exciting, and well-handled. There's less blood and gore this time round, and quite a bit more sly humour, and the welcome return of Sam Neil, reprising his role as palaeontologist Alan Grant. It's a shame Laura Dern was present only as a cameo. All told, this is a fun way to pass an hour and a half, and anyone not too jaded after seeing the first two should lap it up.

I'll admit that the story isn't the most original, but it works well. The t-rex spinosaur fight was cool, but I just wish that it was longer. In fact, I wish the whole movie was longer. It clocked in at over 90 mins. Yes, the movie was great, but I think that it could have been a little better if it was just a little longer. Hopefully the DVD (Which I will buy when i comes out) will have some deleted scenes or additional footage. I know that I am being picky.

Another four years on however, and this time Spielberg takes a back seat as Joe Johnston takes the helm.JP3 skips over The Lost World as if it didn't happen, which isn't altogether a bad thing considering the disastrous reviews it received. Instead we begin with Dr Grant (Neill) trying to raise money to fund his archaeological dig. Despite pledging not to return to either of the dinosaur islands (we know where this is leading.) a rich couple (Leoni and Macy) offer him a large gift to escort them on a flyover visit to Isla Sorna - the notorious second island.Of course, with 100 minutes to fill things are never going to be that simple, as the couple's ulterior motives are revealed along with (surprise, surprise) their party becoming stranded on the island.Jurassic Park without Spielberg was supposed to be like bangers without mash, Morecambe without Wise or Chris O'Donnell without a bad movie to his name. Instead Joe Johnston has created the sequel that The Lost World should've been. Gone are the trite scenes with dinosaurs running amok in the city, gone is the annoying Jeff Goldblum and gone is the clichéd boring dialogue that sent us reaching for the popcorn.True, we do have to endure Tea Leoni screeching like she'd just been forced to sit through An Audience with Carole Smilie, but in the end there are more ups than downs. There are even a few throwaway lines to see who's really paying attention plus the ultimate punishment idea for people whose mobile phones go off half way through a show.A disaster movie is never going to be a Shakespearean play and the director Joe Johnston seizes on this as he exploits the audience by giving into what we want dinosaurs bigger, faster and much more real. Why else would you go to see a dinosaur flick if you didn't want dinosaurs?As with all dinosaur films, the actors are merely bi-products, used to spout a few lines before the next dino pops up looking for lunch. The quality of the CGI graphics and real life models though are simply breathtaking, with the Pterodactyls particularly standing out.JP3 was never going to live up to the original - nothing compares to out first glimpse back in 93, but if all else fails and you find yourself getting bored then you can always revert back to the timeless classic of betting on who will get eaten next.7/10  "},{"Title":"Eat the rich! or they saved the best(version) for last","Date":"24 July 2001","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Just when you thought it was safe to visit exclusive resort islands for the very rich (can you imagine the fear rich kids are growing up with now?)...Either I'm just a sucker for good comedy (from subtle to very absurd) or the first 2 JP's had bottomed out my expectations for a decent script, but JP3 comes out on top. There are none of the make my day swaggering jokes or toilet-seat killings; more like Jaws (we're gonna get a bigger boat, right?). It avoids the nauseating extremes of focusing on kids(JP1) or gore(JP2) though it still clarion blasts the FAMILY UNIT (human or dino)(which doesn't make these family films - would you take a kid to Texas Chainsaw Massacre?). However, at least the idea has some practical benefit (as shown by Laura Dern's rescue which speaks volumes of her unrequited love, and echoes an earlier joke that people aren't whom they seem - her government Public Relations husband obviously is more than that).The film is more traditionally paced, and even manages to build suspense before the chase scenes, simply by NOT showing things. There's beautiful island photography, and some beautifully intergrated F/X scenes (the stampede, the Ptero's). There's a nice bit of speculative science about raptor intelligence which is, of course, immediately validated (though they're certainly not smarter than dogs/wolves when they fall for the oldest decoy trick in the book); also some continuity with the second movie when Dr Grant ranks on Dr Malcolm 's book. Some obvious flaws the editing makes it seems unlikely they could outrun the predatory/stampeding dinos. Dr Grant seems glad dinos escape the island. And after all the deaths little Eric still thinks it's all worth while. He's a leatherface waiting to happen. But the acting, or reacting, is up to snuff. Like the Indiana Jones movies, the third one is the best. PREDICTION Just as plot themes crossbreed with the ALIEN series, JP4 (like Aliens4) will have Laura Dern cloned with a brontosaurus which will fail as a TV pilot for an Attack of the 50 ft. woman series.

AGGH!Sorry to go off like that, but this movie shouldn't have been made.  Sure as far as visual effects go the dinosaurs look good, but after Toy Story, Babe, Shrek, and even the recent Final Fantasy, doesn't having good looking dinosaurs have a similarity to being valedictorian at summer school?

This is NOT JURASSIC PARK 1.5, it does NOT take place between JURASSIC PARK and LOST WORLD.  It is JURASSIC PARK III, and it does take place eight years after the terrible incident at Isla Nubla.  Now, not only is it a different location but a different director, Joe Johnston, who takes over the helm as the director for the third (and hopefully, the last) of the JURASSIC PARK trilogy. It's been eight years since Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) paid a visit to Jurassic Park compliments of John Hammond and Ingen.  After coming near death several times, Dr. Grant made a vow to never step foot around Isla Nubla again.  In fact, Dr. Grant doesn't want to see another live dinosaur again!  For the last several years, Dr. Grant has been doing theories about velociraptors how they can communicate with each other.  He is a world wide celebrity for the adventure he encountered and wrote a book about eight years ago.  In fact, those are the only questions that Dr. Grant gets from his audience members, that and the San Diego incident four years ago that he had no part in.  Dr. Grant is approached by thrill seekers Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni).  They are willing to give a large donation to Dr. Grant's research if he helps them charter a plane over the island to see dinosaurs up close.  Dr. Grant doesn't wish to go back but after the thought of having more money for his research, he bites the bullet and travels back to the island and brings along his young assistant, Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola).  When they reach the island by airplane, Dr. Grant is telling the Kirby's about the dinosaurs when he is told that they are about to land.  Dr. Grant puts up a fight and realizes that the Kirby's are not looking for thrills, but for thier missing son, Eric (Trevor Morgan) who had disappear for eight weeks with Amanda's boyfriend, since the Kirby's are divorced.  The Kirby's also hired a hunter, Udesky (Michael Jeter) to help them look for thier son.  And to make matters worse, their plane crashes and Dr. Grant is on the island that he has never been on.  You see, they are on Jurassic Park site B, Isla Sorna, not Isla Nubla, so this complicates the situation. I at first felt very skeptic about JURASSIC PARK 3, being that it wasn't directed by Steven Spielberg.  I then felt more worried that it was only ninety-three minutes running time, thirty-five minutes shorter than the other films.  And that this film was directed by the same man who did JUMANJI and HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS.  But after watching this film, I found myself to enjoy it quite a bit.  In fact, I thought it was a very enjoyable sequel.  I guess you can compare the JURASSIC PARK trilogy to the DIE HARD trilogy.  The first one is the classic, the second one o.k. but not great, the third is better than the second but not as good as the first. I did enjoy how much exciting and entertaining this film was for the third go around.  And I did enjoy it more than THE LOST WORLD, when I also enjoyed the LOST WORLD.  Johnston manages to give JURASSIC PARK 3 the Spielberg touch with the excitement, family values, suspense, and humor. I have to give kudos for Johnston for doing a good job, as much as he did with his last film, the barely seen OCTOBER SKY.  The acting for a major summer film is also respectable.  Tea Leoni is so-so as the worried mother, at times she is o.k., at other times she's annoying.  William H.

Macy does deserve to get casted for more major film roles.  But if anyone walks away for the acting, it's the always excellent Sam Neill.  I have never seen a bad Sam Neill performance and I always enjoy watching him.  I thought it was Sam Neill, and not Jeff Goldblum who made the original JURASSIC PARK fun to watch.  And with this film you can see the proof, it's Sam Neill carrying this film again, and it's more enjoyable than to watch Neill than Goldblum, who can be a good supporting actor, but not the main star.  And the dinos are again a treat to watch.  The fimilar faces of the Velociraptors and the Tyrannosaurus Rex, to the new faces of the much bigger and scarier Spinosaurus and the errie flying Pteranodon's.  The fighting scene between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus is fun to watch, but it seems too short.  However, it's made up with the scary scenes with the flying Pteranodon's who attack our heros. JURASSIC PARK 3 is one of the more enjoyable films of this summer, but it has the obvious sequel suffering, not as good as the original.  But for a sequel, it is decent and enjoyable, and this will make the fans of the original JURASSIC PARK who disliked LOST WORLD to have a enjoyable time as well.  Like I said earlier, let's stop the series here, while they are ahead, otherwise it's going to get tiresome. ****1/2 (out of five) "},{"Title":"what took them 4 years for this one?","Date":"16 July 2001","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I was very disappointed by JP3.

The thrilling, very creative and interesting task of.... reaching the coast. They meet a couple of dinosaurs on the way and hardly anyone gets killed. No background story. They tried to make it interesting by the fact that the raptors can talk to each other, but they never really used it. The raptors just looked at each other, screamed a little, and ran off. The movie had hardly any suspense. And it ended too quickly. There was no highpoint or anything. They reached the coast and the movie was over.I was very disappointed and so was my wife.If they make a JP4 they should give a really interesting plot, like set it 100 years in the future and there's a Jurassic Park in every major city, or Dinosaurs are used as working-animals and revolt or something. There are so many possibilities, but JP3 didn't use any of them.The only thing I liked was the ringing Dinosaur. That was funny.

Its first sequel is nothing to write home about. The sequel of the sequel even less so.Somewhere in the middle of the movie, someone digs into a steaming pile of dinosaur poop, and that is pretty much how the moviegoer must feel watching this film. The characters to be rescued are for the most part so idiotic you hope they get eaten. Caprona had a better pterodactyl scene than JP III. In fact, if you haven't seen that Doug McClure vehicle from the 70s, rent it instead of JP III. Caprona is far more amusing, and its primitive special effects (yes - they decorated a glider plane to look like a pterodactyl and scoop up a Neanderthal in 1,000,000 BC fashion!) at least have a palpable physical reality.JP III is a muddled mess of robotic acting, implausible character motivations, boredom at yet more dinosaurs eating stupid people. Of course, THE STEVE was no longer at the reins here, but Joe Johnston has directed some pretty decent movies, like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and Rocketeer, so what went wrong? The real blame goes to the script writers. Sam Neill and Johnston should have just 'said no' when they saw the steaming pile of you-know-what that is the script for this film. In fact, a simple piece of advice any movie that credits 3 or more script writers, be as cautious as a movie directed by Alan Smithee before investing your time. Or you will lose two hours of your life, as I did.The film still has professional production values, and the actors attempt to act, so it gets 4 stars because I reserve 0-3 for even worse.

One of the primary elements which made the first two movies so successful was the high level of suspense that Spielberg devoted to them. I did a little research on Joe Johnston, the director, and could have smacked myself for expecting more. Although I am a serious Robin Williams fan, I absolutely detested Jumanji and he directed that, too. Go figure.Although Dr. Allen Grant is brought back for this third installment, the other principal characters are portrayed by William H. Macy and Téa Leoni (as Paul and Amanda Kirby). I liked neither of their characters, and Téa Leoni was stiff and appeared to be a living stop-motion character. William H. Macy was adequate as a duplicitious man with ulterior motives.There were some good elements in this sequel; it was fun to watch and still held a sort of morbid fascination, but the story was of the mainstream popcorn variation and I found it lacking for that reason, principally. The Kirby's kidnap Alan Grant and take him to the second dinosaur-laden island in order to obtain his assistance in saving their son, Erik, who has become stranded on that island. I hated the mainstream addition of the kid. Why do that? They had 2 kids in the first movie, and brought in Malcolm's daughter in the second. Why keep dragging kids onto these islands? It does nothing to help the franchise. Ironically, Sam Neill and Trevor Morgan (as Erik Kirby) were the bright and shining stars in this installment. There is a new dinosaur, one larger than the T-Rex, whose addition to the second island was a complete and total mystery due to the fact that the second installment (The Lost World) supposedly took place on this same island, and this new dinosaur was not present. He was instead ... what? Off watching Friends? The CGI quality in this production was decent, though I detested the addition of feathers to the heads of the raptors. Let science hang! I liked the raptors as they WERE! But I did like the inclusion of pterodons. I have been expecting to see them since the first installment.The best line in the movie? I rescued your hat! delivered by Alessandro Nivola as Billy Brennan.It's sad to say, but the hat is the real star of Jurassic Park 3. I still found it mildly entertaining to watch. I don't have the slightest idea why, but it was still somehow...amusing even though it totally lacked the charm and edge of the first two.I look forward with great anticipation to Jurassic Park 4 (even considering the detested feather factor) and were it the Fiend's perfect world, Spielberg would be back to direct it.It gets a 7.3/10 from...the Fiend .

And another thing Michael Crichton wrote two novels about Jurassic Park. Not three, but two. That's the way it was intended to be. I mean, don't you have the slightest curiosity as to why the scientists keep going back to the darn island? The answer is simple Crichton didn't intend for them to. But for some odd reason Johnston felt he could just grab a camera, buy a poorly-written screenplay, toss in a couple of special effects, present it to us under the franchise name of Jurassic Park, and make just as much money as its predecessors.

An 11 yearold boy survives for 8 weeks in a hostile environment which a large well-funded corporation could not.  Disbelief is greatly suspended as a supporting actor survives an attack from 4 or 5 hungry pterodactyls, and Dr Grant makes peace with the Raptors by communicating with them. Oh yeah - Laura Dern has a cameo.Wa-f***ing-hooApparently Spielberg and Joe Johnston were out to flex their SFX muscles and show some new dinosaurs (especially one that could kick a T-Rex's ass) that they didn't in the first two, as well as to lead the way for some sequel involving political relations with a newly formed raptor democracy.  I imagine some Raptors take humans hostage in their Washington DC embassy, and a team of specialists are inserted to rescue the hostages without killing any raptors (who have just developed nuclear weapons).  Of course Dr Grant would be the reluctant leader/translator along with Ellie Degler (who's young son was on a tour of the embassy with his kindergarten class) and a large team of extras to be devoured in new and unusual ways.  Of course Dr Grant's nonspecific pessimism regarding politicians' dinosaur red tape will be played up, and some new mutated form of raptor will astound and terrify the team.  Ultimately, all important characters will live as will only one of the extras (most likely the one with the most lines).  Peace will be reached with the raptors just before their embassy turns into a spaceship and blasts off.  The movie will end with a Dr Grant telling a notso funny joke about raptors and humans and everyone (despite the gruesome memories of their numerous acquaintances dying horrible deaths in the previous 2 hours) laughs heartily.

I mean, I laughed more in that movie than I did in Germany's comedy production of the year. The plot is non-existent, the dialogue defies description (what would you talk about in life-threatening situations? Yep, losing weight and the weather) and they could not have done a worse job fitting the action scenes together to form a movie. In addition, the ever-so-popular American family values are emphasized to the point of absurdity (My son! I love you! Oh, big carnivorous beast standing in the background- no matter! My SON!!)The predictability of this movie starts with the opening credits where my friend and I just sat grinning at each other, anticipating the claw that would make the III. I loved Jurassic Park and boykotted The Lost World because I was convinced any sequels would ruin the first one. I watched this third one for fun (I swear, whenever I wasn't clawing at the seat or looking away because the eating scenes seem to be getting progressively gorier to make up for progressively bad plot, I was laughing my head off). Now I finally did watch Lost World, and while it was not as good as the first one, compared to this third one it's a cinematic masterpiece. And finally, before I go on to individual scenes, I have to say everything in this movie seems to be recycled from the prequels. Their flight over the island (even the music is the same!), their entering the building, overgrown with vines, the river raft scene is from JP1's novel, as is the pterodactyl scene, and so on and so on...they even stole something from Lord of the Flies. And I hear that after JP3's success, JP4 is already a sure thing. I don't know whether to laugh or cry about this one...-SPOILER WARNING-Some of my favorites from JP3 Tea Leoni's getting out of the plane on an island that's known to be dinosaur-infested, whipping out a MEGAPHONE, and starting to yell around. I'm paraphrasing a little here Dr. Grant doesn't think that's a good idea. WHAT? SHUT UP!! WHAAT? AM I TOO LOUD?!?!?! Ooops, a dinosaur! Now where did he come from? The raptor scene has already been commented by another user- it's just plain ridiculous. Raptors bargaining with the humans- if you give us back our eggs, we won't eat you. Either they're supposed to be too intelligent or too stupid. Grant's scaring them away by calling for help doesn't help. And while we're at it, they barely escape the hungry raptor, run for their lives, and Grant- stops, gapes at it for sheer eternity and comments, Oh my God! It's calling for help!! Oh, great realism. I'm not sure whether I should view the cellphone scene as further evidence of the incredible stupidity of this movie or see it as one of the few ironic hints that this movie takes itself just about as seriously as we do. (the other one would be Grant hearing a raptor talk to him in his dream, which is genuinely funny). After seeing him hunt and eat dozens of people in TLW, I find it hard to believe that T-Rex is suddenly being displayed as a scavenger (which he probably was) in this one. Furthermore, why should he fight with the spinosaur then? If one's a hunter and the other's a scavenger, they're not rivaling species. There are many other examples abound- I hate to break it to you, but everything about this movie except the dinosaur special effects is garbage.

However, this movie is more like The 3 Stooges Meets Jurassic Park. I couldn't stand Tea Leoni's character and kept hoping she would get eaten by a dinosaur. Unfortunately, my hope was in vain as this film followed the Disney-style adventure to an absolute T. There was no way the child was going to come to harm, nor his parents. It was very much like The Lost World in that you knew Spielberg would never allow harm to come to children. It really detracted from the suspense element. As soon as you saw who was in the plane on the way to the island, you could easily predict who would get eaten and who would make it off the island.Back to Tea Leoni. What was she thinking??? Or perhaps I should say, what was the director thinking? What a lame female lead! At least with Julianne Moore and Laura Dern, the women showed an ounce of competence! Teo Leoni acts not like she is on a dinosaur island, but more like she has just come across Scooby Doo. Terrible, just terrible. I fully appreciate comedic moments in suspenseful films to relieve some of the tension, however this movie had very few actual suspenseful moments and the comedic moments were more worth of an Ernest movie.Why does Spielberg insist on having children as the action heroes? Jurassic Park was a very exciting movie, but then he had to go and introduce the Wonder Twins in The Lost World. Killing a raptor by a parallel bars routine?????? It's the same rubbish in this movie, a 12-year old survives for 8 weeks on the island whilst mercenaries don't last 5 minutes. It's the same reason The Temple of Doom was the worst of the Indiana Jones and Phantom Menace was the worst of the Star Wars movies. Just leave the kids at home!! There is no reason to make them all into super-heroes, it just detracts from the adventure and the suspense.Sam Neill, as usual, was excellent. Other than the dinosaurs, he is the one holding this picture together. I just can't help feeling disappointed for what could have been a great movie. The dinosaurs were incredibly well done, and there were a lot of them. It's just the acting, plot, and general story which were lacking. And what was the editor thinking including those terribly unrealistic para-sailing shots at the beginning???? There are some good distance shots, but then the close-ups are so obviously shot on a set that I cannot believe they let that pass. Sloppy, just sloppy. To think they could bring dinosaurs to life in a realistic manner but then leave in shots that look like they come from a 1970's TV adventure is just ludicrous.5/10 "},{"Title":"Not as good as the first better than the second","Date":"23 February 2015","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Jurassic Park 3 was not as good as the first and much better than the second.

Since 1992, to be exact, when the first Jurassic Park came out. When the sequel came out several years later, I was in line. And I was swiftly and painfully disappointed. However, I did enjoy it as one of those so-bad-it's-funny sort of movies. Now comes JPIII, a film that, when I heard that it was in production, I scoffed and swore I'd never go. But, when many critics approved of it, I thought that it wouldn't hurt to go see a matinee.And that's exactly what it was worth. It's a Saturday matinee. It's a Saturday, and I did see the matinee show at 500 PM. And it was as fun as any movie I've seen in a long time. There were problems. The exposition was convoluted and difficult to fully understand (how did Mr. Kirby (Bill Macy) charter a flight anyways? Who were all those supporting characters who bought it so quickly? Why are Sam Neill and Laura Dern divorced? Why the heck are there dinosaurs we never saw in the second movie, and, better yet, why are they always running into them?). Suspense, however, is built very well. Maybe not as well as the first movie, but still quite well. The two new dinosaurs are the Spinosaurus Aegypticus (sounds made up to me) and the Pterodactyl. Both are awesome sights, especially the spinosaur. The scene where they find pterodactyls is the most exciting in the film. I'm glad to see Sam Neill back. Even more glad to see Jeff Goldblum gone (his career is so in the toilet it's not even funny; there's a great jab at his annoying character in this film). Glad to see that Laura Dern has a reduced role (kind of wish they had kept her out all together; her cameo, and the way she comes back later in the picture, felt incomplete and silly). Bill Macy and Tea Leoni are great supporting characters. Trevor Morgan is good as their son, even if it is unbelievable that he could have survived there for two months when the dinos are so darn intelligent (he kind of has a Newt (Aliens) thing going for him). The one really awful character/actor is Alessandro Nivola as Billy, a grad student who accompanies his teacher (Neill) on the expedition. He's nothing but a mimbo (cf. Seinfeld). He can't act and his character is annoying. I nearly clapped when I thought he was pterodactyl food, but his deus ex machina reappearance in the end dropped this film down a notch in my mind. If he returns in the sequel, I probably won't go. All in all, 7/10.

I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan. I loved the first two movies in the series, and now comes the third movie Jurassic Park III. I wasn't sure that I would like this one as much as the first two films since Steven Spielberg decided not to return as director (he does return as executive producer). But to my astonishing surprise, I really did enjoy this second sequel to the big box-office smash from 1993. It's not quite as good as Jurassic Park and just a step down from The Lost World. Jurassic Park III is a movie that is so much fun that I didn't particularly care if the story was weak (which it is). I would have to say the storyline of Jurassic Park III is weaker by comparison to the first two films. However, when I go to see a Jurassic Park movie I go to see it for two reasons action scenes and special effects. And Jurassic Park III delivers on both accounts big time. Sam Neill returns as Dr. Alan Grant, the dinosaur expert from the first film who vows that nothing could persuade him to return to that island populated by genetically engineered dinosaurs. But one day an estranged couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) ask him to be their guide in a plane trip over the dinosaur island Isla Sorna (where most of the events in The Lost World took place). Then things don't go exactly as planned. The plane crashes on the island, and now Grant, the couple, and a few others spent most of the time running from dinosaurs. The couple apparently hide a secret from Dr. Grant. The main reason why they're traveling to Isla Sorna is that their young son (Chicago native Trevor Morgan, who you might remember from the movies The Sixth Sense and The Patriot) gets trapped on the island after his parasail crashes, and they're trying to rescue him. Sure this premise is ridiculous, and there is quite a bit of stupidity throughout. But hey, this is a summer B-movie that is entertaining from start to finish. The performances are nothing special, but it's fun to watch these actors running from dinosaurs. It's nice to see Neill back in what has got to be by now his most famous role, and also encoring from the first film is Laura Dern, who turns up in a cameo as Dr. Ellie Sattler. But obviously the real stars of the movie are the great special effects. These dinosaur effects are super, no doubt about it. The T-rexes and the raptors are back along with a couple of new dinosaurs, which  includes the huge Spinosaurus and the flying Pteranodons. They steal the movie, as they did in the first two outings. The director of this outing is Joe Johnston, who specializes in special effects pictures (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Jumanji) and even though it may not be as good as Spielberg's two JP movies, he does an effective job nevertheless. The thing that surprised me the most about Jurassic Park III was it's short running time (92 minutes). The first two movies ran about 2 hours long. That didn't bother me at all. In fact, it was kind of nice to see a short movie for a change. So many movies nowadays run overlong and they don't need to be. Here is a film that's just good fun. And at least it's great to see that this Jurassic Park series hasn't disintegrated as badly as the Jaws movies did. *** (out of four) "},{"Title":"One of the best summer blockbusters so far!!!Fantastic!!!","Date":"22 July 2001","Score":"5 out of 11 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Having the first JP films and loved them, my expectations for the 3rd were very high, and i am pleased to say I was not dissapointed.It had elements from both of the previous films while adding a few new, and very good touches, for example the dinos looking as real as ever, the intelligence of the raptors and the new dinosaur, Spinosaurus which probably was one of the best i've seen in the series.The characters were well written by making them act like humans really would in a situation like this, no Rambo gun-ho style take on the world action here!!The actors and actresses chosen were fantastic (it was excellent to see Sam Neill reprising his role as Dr Grant!)I gave the film 9/10, I would have awarded it 10 if it wasn't for the daft ending.One of the best summer blockbusters so far!!!Fantastic!!!

Sam Neill gets a welcome return to the franchise as Alan Grant ( far better than Jeff Goldblum as the tiresome Ian Malcolm ), with support from William H Macy, Tea Leoni and Alessandro Nivola. Of the supporting cast, Macy steals the show as the out-of-his-depth Kirby.The novelty value of Jurassic Park's amazing special effects has worn off by now, so the film must rely more on a decent script and good direction to wow audiences. This time, the script gives an intelligent reason for the characters heading out to Isla Sorna ( Site B from The Lost World ), provides some set-pieces which are a little different to those from the previous films, and Joe Johnston does a fine job in the director's chair. I have only one minor complaint about the film, in fact - and this is the fact that the Raptors return, a species of dinosaur I've never found particularly interesting. Nevertheless, at least the script develops them somewhat, and gives them a little more character.Ultimately, then, a good summer blockbuster, a far better sequel to Jurassic Park than The Lost World was, and a far more conventional JP film than many of the internet-spread rumours would have you believe...

My favorite scenes are the plane crash and watching Macy's character fumble for change to operate a candy machine in a deserted lab.Also in the cast are Michael Jeter, Laura Dern and Alessandro Nivola. Dinosaur fans will be greatly pleased. Macy is near perfection. Leoni is extra easy on the eyes.

The developments with Grant's character is really good, the CGI occasionally looked impressive, one or two of the animatronics looked good, the action sequence with the flying pteranodons is great, maybe one or two jokes work... and that is it. To be completely honest this is a movie that I grew up with but now I almost completely hate it. It's lazy, it doesn't take much risks (with the story/characters) and the risks that are taken are insulting, nothing really Happens, yet there is a lot to talk about. It's a rehashed story with uninteresting characters. It can be described as a perfect train-wreck. My first main issue is that the story and characters are lazily written. The basic story is a rescue mission that runs for 90 minutes. It's a bad sign when a movie has such a sickeningly simple story, underdeveloped characters and 3 writers. It could have worked as it's own individual movie but not as a Jurassic Park movie. It took the B-movie route like the Jaws series and didn't care about continuing the story thus making the film feel like a dumb special effect cash cow. The rest of the characters are forgettable, expendable, annoying and pointless. There is even an attempt to make you feel sorry for one character after he supposedly dies. This doesn't work because we aren't given much detail about the character or what his personality is like. Suddenly, he is brought back from the dead... what was the point? A lot of people who do like this movie compare it the first two saying, The other two took themselves too seriously and this was some good B-movie fun! The first two were so good because of their themes and creative ideas and this one just doesn't care and goes for goofy rental action movie. It borrows so much imagery and plot devices from the first two and it's painful. It isn't horrible as a movie, I just can't enjoy it. 4/10Ciaran's Review Jurassic Park 3 almost ruined the entire Jurassic Park series for me. How? Well the movie was just cheap, with a pathetic excuse for a story and a wide range of 'new' dinosaurs to lure audiences in. I believe that after about 30 minutes or so the movie knew the story was fading and so multiple references are made referring back to the original film. The CGI is decent but not brilliant, Grant's character development is good and some jokes are funny- but the movie is ruined by dumb action scenes. Whenever i ask someone how they would rate all the Jurassic Park movies usually JP3 comes in with the second highest rating- this always disgusts me. Many people say JP3 is better because it contains more dinosaurs and has better action scenes... People like Spinosaurus over T-Rex rampaging through San Diego...Ladies and Gentlemen the world has gone mad. As i said before i despise this movie as it almost ruined the previous two Jurassic Park films. Jurassic Park 3 in my opinion is a sin on the dinosaur movie community.

Maybe it was that Spielberg handed the franchise over to his friend Joe Johnston who admittedly seems less confident than Spielberg does, therefore taking a flatter, more risk-free approach to directing the action sequences than Spielberg does. To his credit however Johnston keeps the film moving at a quick pace and it is never boring which is more than can be said for The Lost World Jurassic Park, a film with spectacular and enjoyable action scenes and numerous scenes in between that fell flat.The script for Jurassic Park III was written by the team behind Election, Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, who polished and built upon a script by rookie writer Peter Buchman (who has recently written for Soderbergh's Guerrila). As you might expect from this writing team and without a source novel to draw from the plot devices leading into the action scenes frequently seem a bit, well... retarded (especially a scene late in the film involving Raptors and a 'challenge'). Then again, the humor, dialogue, and opening scenes of the film leading into the action-packed second half greatly benefit from this writing team and improve drastically on The Lost World Jurassic Park. I also don't look for realism in chase movies involving dinosaurs, I look for good adventure atmosphere and lots of action.Johnston does a good job as director, but the film could have been better under more experienced and confident supervision. While in the first two movies Spielberg would create tension and 'wow' moments through expert guiding of the camera during action scenes Johnston's film is more straightforward and safe. The cinematography here is a bit problematic from Shelley Johnson, who tries to expand on the Janusz Kaminski trademark of bright lighting and ends up with a film that sometimes looks a little like a soap opera. Don Davis' music is alternately good and horribly misguided, as well (his original score, I mean, not the recycled John Williams compositions).Still, despite all these flaws the film ends up being a good way to spend 92 minutes. It moves at a brisk pace, the action scenes work, and the characters are all fairly sympathetic. Once you get past the fact that Jurassic Park hit upon a rare sort of big budget movie magic that will never be replicated by any given sequel Jurassic Park III is just a good time at the movies.7.5/10 "},{"Title":"Great entertainment","Date":"10 June 2004","Score":"10 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  I'm surprised by all the negative reviews this film has got on IMDb.

And once again I really enjoyed it.I don't really like Tea Leoni at the best of times, and I found her prominent presence in this movie to be one of it's minus points. It it was a real shame that Laura Dern's character wasn't given more to do instead (like actually accompany the expedition, rather than just sit at home in the States with her kid and answer the phone). But that aside, the other characters were fine - I even thought that the brat kid Erik was quite likable - and of course the dinosaurs were magnificently brought to life yet again. It was also nice to see some new dinosaurs like the spinosaurus, the ankylosaurus and (best of all) the flying pteranodons - focussing just on T-Rex and the raptors for a third time would have been too much of a good thing. The story was a bit predictable I guess, but that said, it wasn't supposed to be a documentary or tax the brain too much. It's pure entertainment and in that respect it delivers.As someone else pointed out, the ending was perhaps a bit weak - a skirmish between the U.S. Marines and the raptors would have made for an exciting climax to the film - but all in all I'd give this one 7 out of 10. If an extended version (click on alternate versions to see a list of deleted scenes) was to ever be released on DVD, I'd certainly buy it.

I had no idea that I'd be waiting on them before we'd be leaving the movie cinema. The length of this film truly astonished me. I never counted on such a fast, lesser storied film, but that's what this is. It is about a group of people being chased by dinosaurs. That's really all you need, and the audience expects it so the filmmakers delivered. It's flawed definitely and I don't buy the ending no matter how stylishly the screenwriters rescued their characters from the certain doom of Raptors. The film has Neill(who is tricked by Macy and Leone who tell him that they desire to see the dinosaur island to sight see)assisting Macy and Leone in finding their missing son on the dinosaur island of Spielberg's Lost WorldJurassic Park. Nivola is his protégé as they somehow try and survive on the island long enough just to find the boy. The film has some amazing action set pieces, specifically when the crew is trapped in the remaining half of their plane as it is being attacked while on top of a tree, a dazzlingly suspenseful chase through a pterodactyl birdcage, and being chased through a laboratory by raptors. The film moves at a brisk pace not focusing on character development, but instead honing in on the action and tense plot of walking through an island forest with no telling what dinosaur lurks around a tree or bush. I found the film hard to swallow, but the action scenes and visual effects deliver. It's short enough, and is so fast based you might not have time to dwell on specifics. I find the ending, when the family is closed within a circle surrounded by Raptors, a bit silly(not to mention the entire military landing on the island just because Neill calls former flame Dern, who must have unspeakable power in federal government), but this film makes up for the flaws with intense chases which almost never cease. I also thought the cast is too good for such an exercise, but this film certainly has an advantage with them being there. It's an entertaining quickie to just sit back and munch on.

It's filmed in a beautiful exotic adventurous jungle. Unfortunately, Tyrannosaurus Rex has a supporting role but there are loads of 'new' predators in this one (great special effects too). Sam Neill reprises his role and leads the new cast that includes Téa Leoni and William H. Macy. There's a funny moment where Neill's Grant takes a dig at Goldblum's Malcolm. I've always liked Leoni's sense of comedy. She doesn't have to rely on contorted facial expressions or slapstick to be funny. Her approach is more subtle. She just has to say the dialogues a certain way and that'll do. With William H. Macy, you just have to look at him and that will get you laughing (I mean that in a good way).

The trailer made it look like a good, fun movie to watch, when it is, in reality, nothing short of terrible. I'm going to go against my own rules in this review, and mercilessly spoil the movie, because, to be perfectly honest, you'll only waste your time watching it.Hearing that neither Steven Spielberg nor John Williams were returning, an alarm went off in my head. This alarm, however, was quickly stifled when I learned Sam Neill and Laura Dern were reprising their roles as Alan Grant and Ellie Sattler. I should've known better.The plot is flimsy, constructed around one or two memorable scenes from Michael Crichton's novel Jurassic Park that had to be omitted from the original movie (due to budget or time constraint, etc.). All the same, these scenes are (pitifully) the movie's only highlights (but rather poor ones at that). Also, the movie is littered with inaccuracies and plot holes. In the original JP, dinosaur embryos had to be kept at a low temperature (-10°C, according to Crichton's book). JP2 took place four years later; JP3 takes place four years after JP2. So how is it that the dinosaur embryos were perfectly preserved (emphasized in a sweeping shot that is an altogether too-obvious set-up for a Velociraptor attack) despite being stored at far over -10°C for eight years? And that's just the tip of the iceberg.The highlights of the first two movies were the dinosaurs. But all of a sudden, I couldn't care less about the advanced special effects. It doesn't matter how much damage a Spinosaurus can do; if it looks as ridiculously fake as it does here (they went overboard with the special effects), I'm not interested. In addition, the Velociraptor looks like some completely new dinosaur, changing drastically (in just four years? Evolution moves fast!) from its look in the previous two films.I addressed a flimsy plot before. Let me point out that the great big, even more dangerous challenge that faces the heroes in JPIII is&#133; wow. The Velociraptors can communicate. Let me take out my watch paint dry kit.Whereas the first two films were ingeniously crafted thrillers, JPIII is obviously crafted for quick profits resulting from the franchise's popularity. Apparently, Joe Johnston wanted to do JP2! I'm glad he didn't I hate his direction style. Scenes that are supposed to thrill or scare are so boring and dumb. As soon as the characters enter a facility where embryos were once kept, I knew they were going to be attacked by a Velociraptor. That's how bad this is.It amuses me to read Roger Ebert's review for the original Jurassic Park, and apply arguments that were inaccurate from his review to JPIII. The human characters are a ragtag bunch of half-realized, sketched-in personalities, who exist primarily to scream, utter dire warnings, and outwit the monsters, he said about Jurassic Park. Nonsense, I say! Mr. Ebert merely had a vision of what Jurassic Park III was going to be like! Because, really, what do we learn about the characters by the end of JPIII? The mercenaries all died right away, and all we learned was that one of them filled in for someone who got sick. (How lame!) We learn that some young kid managed to survive on the island for EIGHT WEEKS when the adult who was with him didn't even get the chance to get down from his parachute before dying. And how did he survive? He hid&#133; in an abandoned truck&#133; With two gas grenades he never used&#133; And he was safe in the back of it, too, despite the fact that the Velociraptors now know how to open doors&#133; His parents were going through a divorce, but got together because of his disappearance. Yay. We learn mom is a bad driver and dad has a hardware store (who, by the way, can somehow afford to buy four cars in three years; one was an SUV and another was a Buick). And yeah, the main thing they all do is screaming. (If anyone wants, I can still find that paint!) The only word of praise I have is for Sam Neill, who flawlessly reprised his role as Alan Grant. But he couldn't save this movie.Finally, the stupidest move the makers of JPIII did was replacing the T-Rex. We see it in ONE scene, where it is killed by the Spinosaurus. And then it's gone! Apparently, a dinosaur that was non-existent four years ago has magically become king of the dinosaurs. (Another plot hole!) The T-Rex always was and will be the star of Jurassic Park&#151; some lame, swimming dinosaur (who apparently swam far enough from the island to kill the crew of a boat that was rather far from shore&#133; LAME!) with a sail on its back will never replace Mr. T-Rex.

Yes those movies were great and indeed it even made the politics interesting but fast forward to the prequel movies and here you had movies that could write themselves with action, adventure & a myriad of subplots. Despite all that the movies were not successful. Jurassic Park III does not try to beat the first movie but instead tries to be an enjoyable watch.I thought the movie was very good. It had a small cast and most of the energy of the film emanated from the Dinosaurs. It was better than the second movie which had a much more in depth story involving Ingen and a T-Rex running around town. This movie was slow and careful. We get a moreintimate experience of the Island similar to the First movie. It lacksthe grandness of the original. The visuals are more important in this movie.Sequels should emulate or have this movie in mind when thinking of doing a sequel to other great films.

Once again Jurassic Park brings back deadly velociraptors and even though Jurassic Park always messes up the size of the Velociraptor they are still as awesome as ever. One thing I don't get is why an adult would take a child any where near an island with ferocious and supposed to be extinct creatures. Some body might say the adult didn't know, but then how did the kids mother and father know to contact Dr. Grant. That was never explained. Also I didn't think that the T-Rex should have been killed off. In the end I forgave all the flaws because of that brilliant twist at the end. I really thought that Billy was gone. Any way, a while ago I was looking for maybe another Jurassic Park and I came across something that said another sequel was coming out in 2012, well now it's 2014 and it says its coming out in 2015.

It has a been-there-seen-that feel and lacks the huge suspense build-up of the 1993 original. Whereas Jurassic Park took a whole hour to get to the dino-action, this second sequel jumps to it in the first 15 minutes with a huge fight between a spinosaurus and a t-rex. Of course the former beats the latter to show the audience who's the baddest mofo on the island. (Incidentally, one dinosaur expert pointed out that, although the spino is larger than the t-rex, its head and maw aren't. In fact, the more slender and crocodilian shape of its head would make it virtually impossible to do what it does to the t-rex. Besides, the spino was basically a fish-eater).In addition to the spinosaurus, we are treated to a good pteranodon scene and another velociraptor sequence (but nowhere near as good as the original), not to mention brief scenes with brachiosaures and anklyosaures.The best part of the story is the return of Sam Neill as Dr. Grant and Laura Dern looks great in a cameo part, but the rest of the characters are weak and forgettable. In fact, the story is merely a clothesline that links the many dinosaur attack scenes in the jungle.At only 1 hour and 24 minutes (or thereabouts) before the credits role this is not a deep story with fleshed-out characters &#x96; flesh-eaten, maybe, but not fleshed-out. If you thought the original film had a weak story and characters, double that here. But the dinosaurs look great and the action sequences are thrilling. These may be worth the price of admission for some but, at the end of the day, Jurassic Park III is just really forgettable.GRADE C "},{"Title":"Step aside T-Rex, Spino's here!","Date":"19 October 2012","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" When I was a little kid, about 6 when this movie was released, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! especially the tumbling plane fuselage action.and it's totally brilliant, going with a new carnivore instead of with the same old T-rex, the fight scene between the Spinosaurus and T-Rex was like Move over Rex, you've had enough screen time! it is very symbolic on how the (JPIII's) director & Writers managed to introduce a new Anti- Hero well, So I give them two thumbs up.

But of course, Spielberg is no longer the director of the series, instead it is Joe Johnston who completely twists the original Jurassic Park movies that we once loved... and still do. With a 4 year spread between each movie, it was kind of hard to know what to expect when the newer one was released. Jurassic Park 2 was a successful hit, providing the same model as the first but with a different perspective. In this one, it seems like everything changed. The most significant difference is the effects. The dinosaurs in this one aren't remotely comparable to the first two. These dinos look almost animated, way worse than the original movies. Of course the T-Rex was well made and the raptors were created differently, the new dinosaur, the Spinasauraus, is an absolute disgrace to the trilogy. I can see what they tried to do here, but it just doesn't work at all and they really fell short in terms of effects. The acting also takes a weird twist, incorporating actors that we've never seen before. Sam Neill returns as main character and does his job well, but everyone else was just too new and too inexperienced to be able to insert into a series like this. They tried making something totally new out of an established series. The adventure part is probably the only decent upkeep about this movie. It is a lot shorter than the two other films, and spends a lot less time talking about nonsense. But instead, you've got the main plot of the movie which is now find our son, which is a radical turn of events from the two others, which had a climactic, theatrical storyline. Also the actors spend a lot of time finding that the fact that they are stranded on an island, is a joke almost. The movie lost it's edge theatrically, it is a lot less stressful but I do admit that some sequences are pretty well thought out. I thought that the best part about this movie was the pterodactyl scene, which is very different than anything we've seen so far. However, the movie does not live up to the main series' expectations. It is definitely the trilogy's downfall, and cannot be compared to the first two. If I had to suggest this to someone, I would say if you're a die hard Jurassic Park fan... get this film. It is a solid addition to the series and you will most likely watch it once every year or two. But if you are a mediocre fan, I suggest you to simply rent this. It had way too much wasted potential and nobody should base this series off of this film. All in all i give this a 6.7/10, it is not a bad movie but could've been ten times better, had Spielberg been the director.

This whole, lets bring a new dinosaur in and replace the old ''king of the jungle'' dinosaur with it idea didn't work to well. The new dinosaur is the Spinosaures which early in the movie gets into an altercation with the old Jurassic Park sponsor ''T-Rex'' and after a brief fight the Spinosaures snaps the neck of the T-Rex and is the new king of the jungle. But even that can be forgiven had it not been for heartwarming loving family scenes in the movie. They just come off cheesy.Example...Eric meets up with his parents ''whom tricked Dr. Grant and his assistant into bringing them to the island''. Anyway when Eric first meets up with his parents they play this overly gushy orchestrated music, the whole scene just comes off as cheesy and embarrassing. And again we are confronted with more family oriented cheese when later that night Eric and his mother and father are sitting in a tree, His father ''Paul Kirby - William H. Macy'' precedes to tell us a story about a fishing trip go awry in which the tow truck driver who had to tow Paul's car and boat out of the boat launch gets angry when his tow truck is pulled in as well and ''threatens to punch his lights out''...It wasn't funny and it totally takes away from what Jurassic Park is supposed to be IMO.Another annoyance of mine is the character Billy...Billy serves as Dr. Grant's trainee basically. A young ambitious paleontologist. Billy does something really stupid halfway through the movie ''Steals Raptor Eggs'' which in turn leads the ever lethal Raptors to pursue them across the island. Dr. Grant doesn't learn of this until later. After a brief confrontation with the Teredactycals in the aviary scene Billy uses a ripped parachute to save Eric from certain death, After which the Teredactycals turn their hostility to Billy, he is last seen being pecked to death as he floats down the river. Billy SHOULD have died in this scene, if anything for dramatic effect. But instead he shows up alive and well at the end of the movie...Well battered from his encounter...But alive none the less.What else...Let's see...I love Sam Neill, the name is a great actor and I really loved him as Dr. Grant in JP1. But in JP3 he was given some...Goofy dialog. Example...During one scene they are being attacked by Raptors...Grant and his gang get the upper hand on one of the Raptors and get it stuck behind a huge iron door that encloses a cage...The Raptor shrills and makes these weird chirping noises...Grant responds to this with...''My god! He's calling for help!''...How do you know that? I mean I know that paleontologist generally know more about dinosaur behavior than anyone else...But come on...And another scene, when one of the Raptors circles their group in the jungle, Grant advises that everyone get down because he's challenging us.Jurassic Park III provides some entertainment...But it just doesn't live up to what it could have been.6/10 stars.

That is not to say that there are not elements to enjoy in this third entry in the JP franchise. In fact, this entry is infinitely more painless than the Spielberg-directed atrocity The Lost World.Having realized that Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm served better as a supporting character than a lead, this entry thankfully brings back the reliable Sam Neill as paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant. Grant is more than happy to have left the denizens of Jurassic Park behind and to return to the excavation of fossils. Unfortunately, he is plagued by funding woes and curiosity seekers. Fate seems to smile on him and his student assistant Alessandro Nivola in the guise of a wealthy married couple, William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, who claim to have gotten permission to fly over the island and want him to act as a tour guide for an exorbitant fee.Naturally Neill can hardly decline, and naturally the couple have misrepresented themselves. To cut to the chase, the ragtag group end up trapped on the island simultaneously looking for escape as well as any sign of Macy and Leoni's young son, Trevor Morgan, who was previously stranded there.Among the improvements from the last sequel are the return of Neill to the lead. It never did make any sense why a chaos theoretician with no knowledge of dinosaurs would lead an exploration a la The Lost World. It is also nice to see Laura Dern back albeit in a glorified cameo appearance. The visual effects continue to amaze and we get the introduction of some fascinating new creatures (the spinosaur and the pterodactyls). The film also develops the rapters in a rather intriguing direction, although it never completely fleshes it out. There is also a truly breathtaking moment aboard a boat on a river with a brachiosaur leaning forward. The film is refreshingly short and sweet, literally flying past.On the down side, the brevity does not allow much time for development. Director Joe Johnston moves things along at a healthy clip, but the tone he sets for the film is oddly light and sorely misses the tension that Spielberg brought to the original (although even Spielberg failed to bring that to the next installment). Additionally, while Johnston has a workmanlike grasp of action sequences, none of the subsequent set pieces seem as exciting as the initial plane crash and attack by the spinosaur. Another problem is that there are so few people on this adventure that it becomes fairly obvious early on who is not going to make it, and said characters are eliminated ridiculously early into the adventure.Another thing is that the new characters as a rule fail to bring much to the film. Macy and Leoni alternate between mild amusement and annoyance as the estranged couple searching for their son. I have yet to figure out why the series feels compelled to shoehorn a kid on each on these jaunts - it fit fine in the original, while not at all in its sequel. That said, Morgan is at least competent and not the embarrassment of Vanessa Lee Chester in the prior film. The late Michael Jeter seems almost laughably miscast as the mercenary leader. Nivola is the exception to the rule here. His character ostensibly has a reason to be included in the action and has as close to a character arc as the film allows. He is sexy, believable and always seems on the verge of breaking out into something stronger, but the film never truly allows it. On a side note, I have a sneaking suspicion that the fate of his character was altered to accommodate how well he connects in the role compared to some of his co-stars.In the end, this is an enjoyable, visually entertaining romp that is a marked improvement over the prior entry, but lacks the punch of the original. Hopefully, there is another sequel looming somewhere in the future that will allow the action to step completely away from the isolation of the islands and which does not feature Vince Vaughn.

I liked it slightly better than the lost world but didn't come close to the greatest dinosaur film ever made Jurassic park one. If you're looking for a ninety minute B movie with dinosaurs chasing people and occasionally eating them with no moments of wonder, the film works. If you want awe, see the original.

From there they must watch out for Velociraptors, Pteranadons, and the largest predatory dinosaur Spinosaurus.I liked and disliked the new dinosaurs that are in this movie.Spinosaurus was pretty cool. He gets to take down Tyrannosaurus and kills some people but Spinosaurus really is not in this film as much as he should be. I thought he was going to be the main antagonist throughout the film. Instead he attacks the group as they land and later appears briefly and breaks a cage and then does not show up again till the end.Pteranadons get a larger role in this film than in The Lost World. Really I did not find the Pteranadons that cool or interesting and if you want to be technical they are not even a true dinosaur.The Velociraptors are also not in this film that much. One of the main complaints I have for this film is that it is too short and really should have been longer to include some more dinosaur parts.The story is bad in this film. How could Grant be tricked so easily by the Kirby family and not realize they were tricking him. Grant is supposed to be smart. Also they do a poor job explaining where the Spinosaurus came from.It is good to see Grant back but he is about the only interesting human character in this film. I really hated Mrs. Kirby played by Tea Leoni. SHe is just so boring and emotionless throughout the film. Also William H.

This should have taken place at the end of the film rather than at the beginning. I think they wanted to show how Spinosaurus is superior but the battle between those two dinosaurs was easily the best part of the film but it happened too soon and after nothing compared with it the rest of the way. Jack Horner was involved with this film and he has always criticized Tyrannosaurus and I think he just wanted to make Tyrannosaurus look bad in this film.The music is just as good as it was in the other two.I liked the Spinosaurs and Grant.

The second movie was shallow in the sense that there was no plot and story or anything special to look for. But the second movie still had a Spielberg magic to it and it was possible for us to overcome the monotone that sets in the second movie. Even though the story line and the progression of the movie was predictable in the second series, it still was a very well handled movie. But the third part fails miserably to do anything good. The third installment had nothing new to offer. A typical case of the same story with a different setting! This time Sam Neill's character has been tricked into going onto the dreaded island. From the very start the whole idea of losing a son on the forbidden island and then tricking a scientist into helping them is absurd on the face of it. We are given a dysfunctional couple and a very weird idea they use in order to get them a guided tour of the island. There is not such a great breakthrough in the graphics. They remain decent though they seem cartoon like on certain occasions. New types of dinosaurs have been introduced and there origin has been explained away in a rather unbelievable manner. We have all of a sudden coordination skills and intelligence being bestowed upon the dinosaurs. They have been raised to status of being almost like humans! There is a point where Sam Neill surrenders the stolen egg to the dinosaurs and they go away with satisfaction and assurance. They clearly are shown to communicate, coordinate and camouflage. One wonders how such intelligence arises. As such, the story line is very poor and the overall direction is not so great. But that still does not mean that the movie is completely worthless. The movie still can be considered as a good watch. But it lacks the magic of the first movie and it definitely lacks the Spielberg touch of both first and second movies.

I don't think it is a good as the first but it is certainly better than the second and the dinosaur footage might well be considered the best yet. This is a straight adventure/rescue story. Sam Neil is hoodwinked into returning to the isle of dinosaurs to act as a tour guide. He is only supposed to narrate what is seen from a plane that will never land. As it turns out, the plane does land and the purpose of landing is to search for a lost boy. The good doctor was shanghaied because the parents of the boy wanted someone with experience running from large carnivores. By the end of the film, everyone has plenty of experience. If I had one real complaint about this one it is the suspiciously good timing of the marines who turn up to save the day. That didn't destroy the story, though. By the time that happens, everything is pretty much over. As with the second in the series, there are plenty of new dinosaurs at which to marvel. These include some that may pave the way for yet a fourth in the series.

I can remember back to my younger years as a student when I played this dinosaur game on the computer. It pretty much showed you every dinosaur there ever was. It had real videotaped footage of the dino's in action. There was an Allosaurus chase among many others. In this movie there are more dinosaurs than some people had thought before. They dinosaurs eat a few people and some dinosaurs are nicer than other dinosaurs. The real thriller here is that Sam Neil somehow has a black daughter. By black I mean African-American and not like Gothic. I could understand if he had a Gothic daughter. Always telling her he's going to study dinosaurs. I'd be Gothic too if my parent told me he was studying live dinosaurs. Anyway she is black through some way or the other and he is not black; however, he occasionally has black in his wardrobe. A focal point of this movie is that they kidnap a baby t-rex and in maniacal crazy killer t-rex fashion they try to eat the people that took the baby. The baby soon learns to speak English and translates to the parents who are still not impressed with the whole situation. The black daughter is also a gymnast and manages to woo the t-rex's with back flips and toe touches. Harelik plays a nice role as someone I can't remember. I think he was more in the background as someone you aren't supposed to remember, so I think he did his job because I can't remember exactly what he did in the film.

The result isn't as disappointing as Part 2, but it does have quite a few dumb moments which unfortunately mar what could have been a very enjoyable dinosaur romp.Jurassic Park III sees Dr. Grant (Sam Neill) returning to real live dinosaur territory after a couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leone) convince him to be their guide on a flyover of Isla Sorna. However, the sightseers have a hidden agenda they are really on a mission to find their son, who was lost in the area a couple of months earlier, and they are determined to land on the island...This simple set up means that it doesn't take long before everyone is running for their lives, pursued by raptors, T-Rex, and new lizard-on-the-block, Spinosaurus.As you would expect from a Spielberg produced flick, this one features top-notch digital and animatronic effects, coupled with plenty of impressive action set-pieces. The film sure looks great, but one can't help but wish that as much attention had been paid to the script as to the visuals.Sometimes it's hard to keep a straight face try not to roll your eyes in disbelief as Grant goes Dr. Dolittle on us and speaks 'raptor' using a 3D model of their 'voicebox'; attempt not to smirk when a ringing telephone swallowed by the Spinosaurus warns the survivors of the creature's impending appearance; and I guarantee you'll laugh when a boy is snatched away from hungry baby pteranodons in the nick of time... by a base-jumping paleontologist in a hastily packed parachute (which he found hanging from a tree!).Before you know it, the whole film is over, wrapped up with a silly rushed ending that seems plucked out of nowhere.However, because my expectations were much lower with Johnston behind the camera than with Spielberg, I actually didn't feel quite so let down by JP3 as I did with The Lost World. In fact, at times I was able to just switch off my brain and enjoy it for the above-average dumb monster packed spectacle that it is.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.

The story was believable (assuming that we have all suspended our disbelieve to accept the terms of the entire trilogy) and the cameo of Laura Dern was nice.

So, for the third time we get to watch an adventure involving people and prehistoric creatures, no matter how contrived the story was. A boy and his uncle (or some other adult) end up at Jurassic Park (go figure) and his parents con Dr. Alan Grant into taking them there to rescue their son. Nevermind that the boy should have been dead within his first few hours on death island, but for Alan Grant to get conned by two relatively dumb and lame parents was also absurd.Once past the unimaginative story to reunite Dr. Grant with the park, the movie goes well. Besides the regular dino menaces, there was a new addition. There was a big bad carnisaur, even bigger and badder than the T-Rex. It was definitely good they added another creature character, and they even had to battle Pteridactyls as well (which was cool). Of course, the special effects were good, as was the setting, scenery, and suspense. Albeit, this wasn't nearly as good as the first, but it was still good.

I am a great Dino-sized fan of the first to Jurassic Park films by Steven Spielberg. The first one was a classic masterpiece, one of the greatest films ever made. The second one was underrated. It was still a masterpiece for me. Both of them are so successful in the box-office, so plans for another sequel, not based on Crichton's novel, are well-prepared. Eventually, JP3 (the abbreviation for Jurassic Park III), although not a tanker at the box-office, wasn't as successful as the first two, but nevertheless, it's still fine entertainment. The film brings back Sam Niell for another round as Dr. Alan Grant to escort a adventurous billionaire couple on an aerial tour at Isla Sorna, the Dinosaurs' breeding ground. What happens? Their plane crashes and they come face to face with another group of deadly Dinos.For something of a monster movie, it was kinda good. But it is highly unnecessary. It's just like a chance to put a group of unlucky individuals in a frightening situation, as in death. Throw back some of the original films' characters, and voilà! It's an official sequel.Nevertheless, as it is, JP3 so rightfully deserves a place in this JURASSIC PARK fan's heart. The fact that it delivers everything it promises is exactly what anyone who went out to see JURASSIC PARK III could possibly want. It's just another walk in the park, but that feels fine.

The scheming and desperation and repentance of William Macy's character creates pity and disgust and frustration which is not only well demonstrated by the other characters but can be felt by viewers, as well. The audience can participate in the emotional flow. I enjoyed the interjected humor and the way the action was balanced out. And like with JP1, I'm glad the director realized that an action movie could also be scenic. I'm ready now for 2008's JP4. "},{"Title":"Not Dino-mite! But better than Part 2","Date":"1 January 2007","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" For Jurassic Park 3, Steven Spielberg steps back, and assumes the mantle of Executive Producer. In the directors chair this time is Joe Johnston. Based on Johnston's CV, he was eminently qualified for the job. In fact I can't imagine a man more suited to the world of Jurassic Park than Joe Johnston. He tends to specialise in films that are action-packed thrill rides that intriguingly feature a jungle. Films like the superb Honey I Shrunk the Kids and the engaging Jumanji.And I'm pleased to say Johnston did a fine job with JP3. It's a better sequel than The Lost World. Granted its got an extremely sketchy plot, and takes place on Site B again, a place I despised in the last outing. But at least the action scenes are done with Johnston's consummate skill. And even at a slim 90 minutes, I had a much more fun time than I did with Part 2.JP3 heralds the welcome return of Sam Neill as Dr Alan Grant. And the early scenes with Grant's character are surprisingly poignant. Eight years ago, Grant was on top of the world. He was one of the world's foremost paleontologists, he was in a blossoming relationship with his beautiful girlfriend Dr Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern who makes a brief cameo here) and his work was acknowledged and respected.But time has not been kind to Dr Grant. Alan and Ellie are no longer together. They're still friends but she's happily married with children. Funds for Grant's research have dried up over the years, and many people have lost interest in his work. I felt real sadness for Grant here. Which made me realise how integral his character is to the success of the Jurassic Park series.Grant has been studying the intelligence of Velociraptors, and gets a chance to study them up close and personal when a couple, Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H Macy & Tea Leoni) want Grant to be their guide on Site B. Their son Eric was lost there during a paragliding accident, and with the authorities unwilling to help, Grant is their only hope.But no sooner have they arrived on Site B, our intrepid heroes face dangers and dinosaurs at every turn. JP3 may have the thinnest plot of the trilogy, but I enjoyed this film far more than the last one. The problem with TLW was although Spielberg staged some very exciting moments, there was nothing else to the film beyond that. They were just a loosely connected set of action scenes, with each one trying to outdo the other. But Joe Johnston has managed to incorporate some fascinating new dimensions.First off, the stars of the previous JP films were the T-Rex and the Velociraptors. In JP3, the T-Rex takes a back seat...to something much worse. If such a thing is possible.The badass dino this time around is actually a new kid on the block. The Spinosaurus. I've never actually heard of one, but apparently they did exist, and if JP3 is to be believed, its a much worse killing machine than the T-Rex. Makes you wonder why its so exalted.The Spinosaurus is one lean, mean eating machine. A huge snout. Razor sharp jaws. A deadly looking spine on its back. And its bigger than a T-Rex. It gets some marvellous moments too. Like the heartstopping sequence when it attacks their plane. And the wonderfully choreographed battle between the Spinosaurus and the T-Rex. It's a thrilling fight. And looks like something right out of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World.That's the great thing about JP3. The variations on tried and true methods. Spielberg didn't try anything different in Part 2, which is why the film suffered. But Joe Johnston has crammed tons of new ideas into this instalment. We get to see flying dinosaurs for the first time. And the swooping, soaring Pteranodons are a sight to see. They're not only a majestic view, but quite frightening too.And the Velociraptors, the scariest dinos in Part 1 have been given something else to do too. We've always known how intelligent they are. But here, they've developed to the point where they've acquired speech. Fortunately the film doesn't try anything cheesy as translating their grunts, but this added level of intelligence heightens their scare quotient.Johnston doesn't leave the actors out though. Neill is as impressive as ever, and its nice to see he's evolved over the years. He seems more comfortable around children now, and his scenes with Eric are great. As for the actor who plays Eric, Johnston does a great job fleshing out his character, making him a resourceful boy capable of fending for himself. He survives two months on his own on the island without any help. That's one thing I like about Joe Johnston's films. The children in his films can be capable, young adults without seeming precocious or obnoxious. I love Eric's comments on Jeff Goldblum's character Too much chaos. Everything's chaos with this guy.William H Macy is OK, but only puts in an adequate turn. Almost like he's doing a poor man's performance of Jerry Lundegaard from Fargo. Tea Leoni is relegated to the position of annoying screamer. But Allesandro Nivola's pretty good as Grant's protégé, who makes one questionable decision that plunges our heroes into a series of dire consequences.JP3 is a bit episodic. It's basically a series of disasters our heroes must overcome to survive. And the ending is surprisingly abrupt, not to mention disappointing with help handed to them on a silver platter. But I enjoyed it a hell of a lot more than Part 2. The final image of pteranodons flying off into the horizon clearly signifies developments for a further saga. Not sure what else they can do with the franchise, but with Joe Johnston back at the helm, it should be nothing less than bloody entertaining!

I don't know what it is about it, but it has a feel much closer to the originals, and it makes it quite enjoyable. In this Jurassic outing, Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) is back, and now is an author telling his tales from the park (his book is rivals with Ian Malcom's). He gets trapped on the island again when taking a couple (William H Macy and Tea Leoni) on an in flight tour, and the plane gets trapped in a tree. Where the first film focuses more on the T-Rex, this one focuses on the raptors and their intelligence. Watching this, it was actually a pretty good movie, all except the extremely abrupt ending. Where you expect to get another thirty minutes of Dino action, we get a tacked on and quite annoying ending, however the movie is still very good, for what it is. In the battle between protagonists being Sam Neil or Jeff Goldblum, I find Neil is much more tolerable and Goldblum is much better as a side character.My rating *** out of ****. 85 mins.

The survivor's are trapped, without communication to the outside world, no way to reach safety & surrounded by various carnivorous Dinosaurs both small & large...Directed by Joe Johnston I thought Jurassic Park III was an OK time waster, you know it's one of those big budget Hollywood films which has no soul or real purpose other than entertain & dazzle with state-of-the-art special effects & it's extravagant set pieces. The script by Pete Buchman, Alexander Payne & Jim Taylor is something of a mystery as it was widely reported that the film was shooting before the script had been completed, in fact William Macy spoke to the press & criticised the film over this aspect. Maybe that's why the film turned out so shallow? Maybe that's why the character's are cardboard cutouts? Maybe that's why the dialogue is so simplistic? Maybe that's why some of the ideas here are never really followed through? Maybe that's why the whole Raptors being intelligent & even being able to 'talk' to each other comes across as just plain stupid? Oh, & why did the script have to include yet another annoying kid? Who knows? The film certainly moves along at a decent pace, it has the requisite number of action/special effects set pieces (some of which were apparently left over ideas from the scripts of the previous two Jurassic Park films which also says something in itself) & as a Hollywood spectacle it's perfectly reasonable. I don't know, it's watchable in a popcorn kind of way but ultimately it's shallow & lives or dies by it's special effects.Director Johnston does alright, there's a distinct lack of tension & there's not much in the way of scares either plus he ruins the Raptor's by making them intelligent. The new Dinosaur's are cool & as expected the special effects are top-notch, they're pretty much flawless. I particularly liked the flying Pterodactyl's & the scene when they attack Alan & co. is my favourite part of the film. There's not as much blood in this one & the whole tone seems lighter, only a couple of people get eaten on screen this time around.With a supposed budget of about $93,000,000 Jurassic Park III is as well made as the previous entries & definitely has that Hollywood polish about it although they didn't spend much of that on the music as it's the same John Williams theme that is used throughout the previous entries. The acting doesn't matter that much, everyone plays second fiddle to the Dinosaurs anyway. Interesting according to the IMDb Jeff Goldblum & his character Ian Malcolm were included but he injured his leg during the first few days of filming & dropped out, a shame as he is the best character in the Jurassic Park films.Jurassic Park III is good solid popcorn entertainment, the special effects are predictably impressive & if all you want are action set pieces & Dinosaurs then this is just about as good as most out there.

Hollywood. Not enough real life situations (Eric, not matter how good a Boy Scout he was, would NOT have been able to survive on a dinosaur-filled island for 8 weeks), and far too much in the way of 'overacting' (if that's possible). Téa Leoni annoyed me a lot in this film- SOMEONE STOP HER SCREAMING. The typical Hollywood end didn't appeal much, but still... it is American. Watching most of the mercenaries die in the first few minutes wasn't particularly appealing- where's the psychological element of waiting for them to get picked off??? Come on! Also, the noises the dinosaurs made... poor, to say the least. The first film had amazing, floor-shivering roars, and genuinely scary snarls and squeaks. This film obviously employed some guy making snarly noises into a voice disguiser for a phone. However, the bad points are few and far between... the only other one I can really think of is the end. It felt far too rushed, as if the film crew just realised that they had £5 left in the piggy bank- Hang on, guys- we're about to hit the red- take 6, and call it a wrap.These bad points aren't enough to condemn what is essentially an enjoyable, and intelligent, film. A fair amount of the dialogue is fairly snappy, but not in places where it would be inappropriate. You've got to love some of the prophetic fallacy! The first encounter of the raptors also made me smile... mainly because I was waiting for Téa Leoni's character to get what she deserved. The fight scenes, dinosaur between dinosaur, were awesome. I still think that killing the original anti-hero of the first film is an unforgivable act, especially as the science books say that the killer is inferior, but re-using the same villains is wearing- as many horror films have proved...What I prefer about this (macabre as it sounds) is that you actually get to see people being eaten. The Lost World relied too heavily upon the psychologically effective blood-in-the- water (a good way to cut down on special effects by pouring a lot of red food dye into the water...). So it's refreshing, at least. The scene with the plane is also very good- atmospheric? Just a bit! The raptors also manage to create genuine suspense, and the way they are portrayed is chilling. I was also a fan of the large birds ;).In isolation, this film is a definite 7 out of 10- some bad points, but nowhere near enough to turn it into trash. Compared to the other 2... well, it can't hold a candle to the first one, but comes close to the second one. Roll on Jurassic Park IV, but do spare a thought for Jurassic Park III, and give it a go!

The most crucial thing is Spielberg's directorial touch. Joe Johnston is not nearly as skilled a film maker as Spielberg and it is clearly felt. Johnston has a pretty good flair for the action scenes but the emotional, human based scenes are severely lacking. Luckily Spielberg is still a producer on the film allowing him to have some influence on the final product.Acting wise the film has taken a step down from the two previous films. Spielberg put a lot of effort into making all characters seem well rounded in both of the previous films in the series but this approach seems to have been abandoned somewhat for the third film. Sam Neill is a welcome return and even though his character is nowhere near as developed in the first film he still produces the best performance by far in the film. William H. Macy is decent but not the best I've seen from him. He is, however, adequate. Téa Leoni is more stiff in her acting. Even though I usually like her, her performance in this film seems somewhat forced and not completely believable. Where the film truly suffers is with the characters of Billy and Eric (played by Alessandro Nivola and Trevor Morgan). Neither of the characters are believable. Especially not Eric who apparently has survived for 8 weeks on an island inhabited by hungry dinosaurs. This is preposterous to say the least as Trevor Morgan comes off as being a spoiled brat rather than a Rambo-like survivor. The fact that he survived for 8 weeks is casually explained with him being hard to ground when he was younger(!). I mean, how ridiculous can you get.The film isn't bad, however, and has many entertaining sequences. The effects have naturally improved and the dinosaurs look more realistic than ever before. New concepts have been added to some of the species. Like, for instance, a row of feathers on top of the male raptors heads. As with the previous films an incredible attention has been paid to the details and this provides for a high level of credibility that these creatures might actually exist. Some scenes really had my blood pumping like in the previous films and this is where Johnston proves his worth. The best scene is undoubtedly a battle between a tyrannosaurus and the new addition the spinosaurus which is even larger than the tyrannosaurus. This scene I can watch again and again. Even though I prefer the tyrannosaurus as a symbol for the films I think it is appropriate that a new, fresh dinosaur was used.The moral aspect is not as clear in this film as it was in the previous film and is only ever mentioned in one particular scene and it seems clear that the film was just made to prove how far the level of effects had progressed and the film proved that they have progressed pretty far. Conclusionary Jurassic Park III is not as good as neither of the previous in the series but it is entertaining and worth a look if only for the effects sake.6/10 "}{"Title":"Not bad; but ultimately pointless","Date":"18 August 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I came into this movie not knowing what to expect. Over the years I have found myself becoming something of a Jurassic Park fanatic for some unknown reason, but after The Lost World I was cautious as to what Jurassic Park III could bring to the table.What I like about this movie is it doesn't try to overachieve It knows it's role and plays to that. We are thrown back onto Jurassic Park Site B through a transparent plot that only serves as a small bridge to what the viewers came to see Dinosaurs. From the minute they land on the island, it's one dinosaur encounter after another in rapid fire succession. Just as our characters get out of one hairy situation, they find themselves smack dab in the face of another danger, usually in less than five minutes. The movie rarely lets up in this regard.While some might argue that this leaves little room for character development, it does manage to eek out some amusing lines For example, throughout all of the original Jurassic Park, Alan Grant was not the type of person who likes kids. Slowly, over the course of the film, he starts to become attached to Lex and Tim (the two children). Here, in Jurassic Park III, Grant finally finds a kid with whom he can identify with. But, ultimately, the plot goes nowhere; you can practically pick every character who dies within 10 minutes. There is a very clear line between who's an important character and who isn't.Luckily for us, at 90 minutes, the movie doesn't wear your patience very thin. By the time When Dinosaurs Attack!! starts to get old, the credits aren't far off. What we are left with is a harmless movie that has it's fun moments, and for the moments that *aren't* fun, they're at least much better than a lot of the cringe-worthy sequences we had to endure in The Lost World.

Okay, he did direct Honey, I Shrunk The Kids but he also did The Rocketeer and Jumanji, which doesn't bode well for a director of popcorn entertainment.Jurassic Park III is, therefore, something of a surprise; in terms of plot the script by Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor makes the previous movies seem like a Robert Ludlum book, but we also avoid one of the biggest flaws of the two earlier movies - Jurassic Park was a third over before it got going, and The Lost World Jurassic Park took an entire hour (i.e. up to the overlong sequence with the cliff) before it took flight... a problem that Hook also had, which suggests that his detour into grown-up movies gave him time to get his pacing problems over with. That or get better scripts. But this time the movie has an abbreviated running time, which means that there's no real room for messing about - it knows the audience has come to see people in danger from dinosaurs, and it delivers.Johnston's no Spielberg in terms of building tension or sustaining action scenes (it doesn't really build to a climax), but the movie's got enough sincere performances and excitement, along with some nice moments of humour, to help you accept that ultimately it doesn't mean that much. Not that it's supposed to, but you do like to get something extra from your movies - this is certainly better than the second sequel, but lacks the impact of the original.Incidentally, since this movie - like the second sequel - takes place on the second island and not in Jurassic Park itself, the movie should really be called The Lost World II Jurassic Park, no?

The very premise of this franchise is, well, extinct. In 1993, when the original Jurassic Park came out, people were on the edge of their seats for one simple reason - this looked like actual dinosaurs, interacting with humans. Nothing like it had ever been seen before. 1997's sequel tried to compensate for its lack of originality by being ultra-violent. This third installment has no new tricks up its sleeve. As a result, instead of being properly terrified, the audience thinks to itself, Hey, the dinosaurs are back. Cool.JP3 compensates for that familiarity by simply adding more dinosaurs. Running a half an hour shorter than the first two, this film still manages to pack in more dino-bang for your buck than both of the originals.

So here I go again.Jurassic Park was most definitely one of the greatest movies ever made.  It combined the enthralling special effects of Steven Spielberg, the creative genius of Stan Winston, the writing of the talented Michael Crichton, and the excellent themes of John Williams.  In other words, it was very near perfection.The Lost World was a flop.  And Jurassic Park III is obviously an attempt to get the series back into gear.When I first started watching the movie, I didn't feel the same excitement that the first one brought.  Quite possibly because of the new director.  Or maybe Don Davis' disgusting themes.  Or perhaps it was just because it tried to hard to look like the first one.  But somehow I felt that Jurassic Park III was separated from the other two, that Alan Grant was totally different.  We didn't even get to see Mr. Hammond.The special effects aren't as great as its predecessors.  The T-Rex is barely believable; something just looks wrong with it.  The spinosaurus is nothing compared to the sheer magnificence of the T-Rex in the first movie.  It just doesn't have the power to drop your jaw, most likely because it has a lame entrance and is not much different from the T-Rex anyway.The actors do really well, I think.  Sam Neill remains one of my favorites, and Alan Grant has also been a favorite character of mine for a long time.The concept of going back to Isla Sorna and finding something new (the spinosaurus) is kind of weird.  It doesn't even seem like the same island as it was on The Lost World.  The compound is not the same, and the raptors look different.  One thing I do like, however, is that this movie is a little brighter.  In The Lost World, it was almost always night, making it a very dark movie.  This one wasn't so nasty.  But the first one had the perfect balance, combining both day and night.  This one is too bright.The plot is obviously not one of Crichton's.  Unfortunately, this movie is not based on one of his books.  However, that may be a good thing, considering how badly The Lost World was ripped apart in the conversion from writing to screen.  But it's easily discerned as not Crichton's work.Don Davis' music is simply awful.  He attempts to re-use the main themes in the exact same spots they were used in Jurassic Park, which didn't fly well with me.  They needed John Williams in there.  I have never liked Don Davis since his performance in the Matrix, and he certainly didn't do well here.  His music is kind of screechy, lacking any themes other than Williams' originals.But Jurassic Park III is a little more like the first one, which makes it better than The Lost World.  I enjoyed the thrill ride (although extremely predictable) and expect to see better things when Jurassic Park IV is released.Despite my hard opinion of this movie, I actually enjoyed it and would recommend it to any thrill lover, especially those who are fond of the Jurassic Park series.

There is almost no film by Johnston that wasn't entertaining. However, I disagree that JP3 was actually darker and more involved than the previous two movies, like previews and articles depicted. I wasn't expecting Jurassic Park III to surpass the wonder of the first one, and I wasn't expecting it to be as disappointing (the Lost World was still pretty good) as the second one.As a fan of all of the Jurassic Park movies, I could say that this had the nicest and yet quickest pacing. It also had the best special effects of the three. One thing I've noticed is that the first two took place mostly in the dark, especially when there are special effects. Now, you actually get to see the texture of the dinosaurs. The dinosaurs in JP3 tend to have more color, thanks to Industrial Light & Magic and visual effects supervisor Jim Mitchell.One thing that the third installment lacks are likable characters, with the exception of Sam Neill as Alan Grant. New characters aren't as humorous, but this could be because of the abscence of director Steven Spielberg. And even Joe Johnston has the potential to put humor in his characters to make them a little bit more likable.Overall, JP3 was a good addition to the Jurassic Park franchise. I can guarantee that there will be more movies. Hopefully Steven Spielberg will return as producer, because if he doesn't, then Jurassic Park will end up like Batman when Tim Burton left.

The lost world is my favourite film because it continued on from Jurassic Park, this film has nothing to do with The lost world!Where did the Spinosaurus (the dino with thing on its back) turn up from? Did just magically appear? How come we didn't see it in other films?Oh and when that T-rex was killed by the Spinosaurus, would the mate of the T-rex not have killed the Spinosaurus? In the lost world the T-rex went after Sarah and Nick for taking the baby T-rex.I should stop bad mouthing the best film of 2001. Any LOTR fans wanna argue? This was the best film this year!The special effects were good at parts and terrible at others. One of the good parts was when the Pteranadons (flying reptiles) attacked Billy. They looked real! The Spinosaurus well, you could make something more real looking in Paint!Oh and it never explained what happened to Billy between getting attacked and ending up at the coast!This is a good film and the action was great but a different predator for JP 4. Please!!!!! The Spinosaurus was crap, how about a Giganothosaurus(biggest carnivorous dino) or T-rex?Another thing how could the Spinosaurus break down a fence but not 2 smaller doors?This is the greatest film of 2001 and I'm hoping Joe Johnston doesn't make 4 but another by Speilberg would be welcomed by me. 8 out of 10 "},{"Title":"As good as the original","Date":"3 February 2002","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Although many sequels fall short of excitement of the movies that spawned them, Jurassic Park III is as thrilling as the original.At first glance the Kirbys (Téa Leoni and William Macy) seem to play the requisite Stupid Couple whose adventurous spirit is responsible for the plight of the entire plane, which is stranded on Isla Sorna - the second dinosaur island.  It turns out that they are really no longer married, but desperate to find their son Eric and the man he was with, Ben Hildebrand, Mrs. Kirby's new love interest.  In the opening scene Ben and Eric are taking an illegal parasailing tour of the island, when the pilots of the boat disappear in the fog.  Ben and Eric, of course, get stranded on the island and require rescuing.JP3 brings back some of the cast from the original movie, and I was glad to see returning performances from Sam Neill (Alan Grant) and Laura Dern, (Ellie Degler) although Ellie's role is little more than a bit part.  The sardonically humorous Jeff Goldblum (as Ian Malcolm) is missing, as is Richard Attenborough (as the park's conceptionist John Hammond) but they were included in JP2.These performances combine to tell the tale of a family and its guides who must constantly evade a large, unexpected predator as well as a persistent pack of raptors which seem unusually bent on catching the party.  The third group of dinosaur enemies comes from the air, as for the first time the reptiles take wing in Jurassic Park.Overall this isn't a film that I'd expect to sweep the Oscars, but it is worth viewing a few times.

An 8 in my rating is considered great.  A 9 is excellent and a 10 is excellent and a classic. There are only a couple of movies I give 10's to so consider my rating in that sense.From the start I liked the way the movie was filled with suspense and stomach wrenching scenes.  It had a good balance of highly volatile scenes and some calming, slow your heart down scenes.  The balance is set for an action movie so there are a lot more suspenseful scenes than slower ones.It's not easy finding a good plot that will bring us back to the island where the dinosaurs were created.  There had to be a real reason to go back and something different to see when we got there.  Jurassic III filled the bill.The special effects were terrific!  I watched The Making of Jurassic Park III after seeing the movie and found myself admiring it even more.  The work that went into it was astounding in order to give us, the audience, the feeling that what we were watching was real.  Make sure you watch the bonus material if you get the DVD.This could be my favorite of the three Jurassic Park movies.  I know I can watch if more than a couple of times without getting sick of it.

There may be other things but these appear to be the main ones that reviewers tend to focus and rate a movie on.Thus, taking all these elements together into consideration how does this movie rate? Well, strictly, put it doesn't - neither did the other Jurassic park movies - nor should they - because the movies weren't written or directed to reach a high level of each of those elements. If one element was focused on - its special effects, in bringing dinosaurian to `life'. The movie was created to entertain the audience in order to appease the masses in order to return a reasonable profit margin. The whole focus I think with movies like these is to purely entertain people who want to spend an hour or two away from reality, to use their imagination to transfer themselves into the realm of sci-fi fantasy. I believe that's what Jurassic Park movies are, sci-fi fantasy. Not strictly horror or a monster movie because these so-called `monsters' happen to be based on fact (fossilized bones). The first Jurassic Park movie did very well because it was the first, to put dinosaurs on screen (the most realistic to date), with very state of art special effects. Thus, Its becomes very difficult to pique the same amount of interest in sequels, to do something very different. Its not that the first Jurassic Park was that much superior in storyline, but its storyline is inherently more in-depth because sequels tend to play off an established storyline rather then create a whole new world.If you are person who can get lost in a world of imagination then all three movies a very effective, and all three bring out the main characters of the movies, the dinosaurs. Whether one is better than the other, its matter of personal expectation and perception. For movies like these actors are very important but in-depth characterization need not be. They are not the focus even though they do bring out the storyline. Personally, I liked the third one the best. The reason why is I didn't go into the movie theatre with an expectation to see a flawless storyline. Plus, I made the mistake of reading the books first, and thus, had the expectation of going in expecting an onslaught of scientific facts (which drew me into the book the first place).If you think long and hard enough, all movies that have ever been made has had at least some flaws, gaps of logic, or inaccuracies in them because the movie averages around 1 to 3 hours long, and like a plan or strategy cant possible take into account every possible or scenario or element. Therefore, plot holes are inherent in all movies. Thus, in my opinion criticism regarding plot holes is pretty much redundant.Why did I go see this movie then? Because I'm a movie buff and a dinosaur fan. I just wanted to see somebody's perspective of what they think dinosaurs would be like if they were alive today. Frankly speaking, all three movies have a lot of inaccuracies and wild speculation in regards to dinosauria. And frankly speaking, that's okay, because these are not educational documentaries. And if you want to be educated on things dinosauria then read something from Jack Horner, Robert Bakker, David Norman, Thomas Holtz, or the like.However, having enjoyed the movie and the depiction of dinosaurian, I do have some comments on what I would liked to have seen done more in the movie. It would have been nice if the directors and screenwriters were more accurate with dinosaur facts. Instead taking Hollywood liberties with the facts, they could have taken more liberties with speculation of current dinosaurian paleontology instead.For example in Jurassic Park I velociraptors were far too big (at least twice the size - perhaps more based on the deinonychus) in the account of fossils sizes found with this species, Brachiosaurs did not chew like a cow (their jaw structure would not have allowed those movements); Lost World, stegosauria had their back plates in two parallel rows rather than a line of alternating plates (across two rows), pachycephalosaurus would have had severe head damage banging into that vehicle like that  (its skull is actually shown to be porous and fragile under strain); Jurassic Park III the tyrannosaurus should have made a least some damage to the spinosaurus if not killed it, when it bit into its neck (esp. with the expected power of  its powerful jaws).  I could go on with the inaccuracies, but you get the point.I instead would have liked to see speculation on the connection between birds and dinosaurs (esp. dromaeosaurids) and have seen colourful theropods with feathers on them, and perhaps vast difference between male and female. And maybe shown some species start to evolve into birds.  It would also have been good to see more of the speculated paternal instincts of some dinosaur species like the hadrosauridae or some theoropods (esp. nesting rituals), or the defense strategy of ceratopsians against predators (moving into a circle) If they created a park with flying reptiles like the pteranodons why not also include the sea reptiles like plesiosaurs.But like I said, this isn't made to educate. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and I liked them all.

The action sequences are very impressive, so if the audience wants nothing more than a stranded rescue team outrunning exotic-looking beasts which are attempting to devour them, then this is their lucky day.

The movie is short.That right there summarizes all of the positive aspects of this entire 'film'.  Action-packed?  yes.  Meaningful?  hell no.  Dinosaurs still cool? not this time.This plotless romp through the jungle does not need to be seen to be understood.  It can be described in well less than 25 words with ease. Cast flees through dinosaur infested island to escape.  If I were to say more I might be forced to us the word lame situations and poor supporting acting in access so I won't even start.There is one scene that really hits upon what this film is all about.  It is early in the show so it won't really spoil anything.  Macy's character, a rich guy apparently, is trying to motivate Dr. Grant to go with him back to the island.  Macy pulls out his check book and says Tell me, what's it gonna take?  They script writers must have been present when the cast was brought on board because I imagine a similar conversation being told to each actor/actress.  Tell me, what's it gonna take to put you in cardboard-thin roles in our sad excuse for a script?Unlike the original don't expect to get too attached to the characters.  My comment about they shallowness is hardly a joke.  When they die, unlike the first JP, I could hardly care.  It is however a slight improvement over The Lost World where there were more bit-roles getting eaten than I could count.My final complaint lies with the guest-stars of this movie, the dinos.  In the first movie the raptors were more ambiguous.  They were new and scary, the perfect combination for an enemy. They were hunters, silent trackers and killers.  In JPThe Lost World they've decided that their Rambo-esque lifestyle had been overused in the first movie.  So the raptors were demoted to packs of wolves attacking deer-like humans.  But this lamer way of portraying those pesky raptors is changed again in the 3rd film.  Neil opens the film by discussing about how smart he thinks the raptors are.  This right off is a bad sign.  It turns out he's right (surprise!) and they're the most smart monsters that has ever been brought to life.  Perhaps too smart. I was happy when the beasts could open doors, but now we have them speaking German?  I think we might have noticed this behavior in the first couple movies.  But I guess Spielberg overlooked the fact that the Raptors talked amongst themselves about 90% of the time.  If they had I can now see what Bob Peck was getting at when he said that one raptor had killed some of the other raptors.  I was itching to kill them after they had finished their first couple of screeching speeches.Don't expect the quality of the first movie nor the intricate, yet dumb,attempt of the second.  JPIII is an action film, and nothing else, a genre that I hope we'll grow out of before I'm feeding worms.

His theories now seem to fall on barren soil because as a scholar said any scientist who wants to study or discover anything can just finagle a trip to the island. Grant is firm in the hypothesese that the dinosaurs on the island are nothing more than genetically engineered monstersA chance to improve his financial stance comes when two thrill seekers show up and ask for him to guide a strictly air-borne observation of the island for thier anniversary, offering that they can write all kinds of numbers on a check and ask what will it take for his assistance. Anyone doubting that even wild dinosaurs could drag him back there should atleast see this set up in play before making a pronouncement. He agrees, perhaps a little longing for a second look at some Pre Hi giants played a part aswell. Rather than try to break the news up front about thier true intentions the couple and thier three 'professionals' simply ignore his attempts at narrating the tour and prepare for landing, finally seeing red he leaves his seat demanding YOU CAN'T LAND THIS PLANE! before one of the goons thumps him from behind.The story moves a bullet a gate from that point. Some successfull humour is scattered throughout the movie and it never seems to take itself quite seriously but at the same time it never goes spoof. It is almost heartbreaking for a dino divotee to see Trex get it's kneck broken by a solar powered scavenger that they have turned into some bi-ped crocodile. One thing that is also annoying is that now they have added some hind-neck hair to preserve a bird-like appeal with the raptors, that's fine for the individual movie except that the raptors have now changed pattern, form and size three times. Lost World's justification for the change was that what we were seeing was the males of the species, Nublars original inhabitants were all female. I don't know what they saw to justify walking into such a wall as that of breaking continuity with the species in part 3.With the original movie Spielberg was advised by the experts that Terranodons were not capable of the kind of aggressive manueuverability that they wanted for a climactic helicopter attack, it was also cut from The Lost World but here they have gone and used the fiction for an aviery action sequence, Terranodons are taking flight with human beings in thier claws which would according to experts not have been capable of. The ending is hardly an opening for a sequel concidering what a dull movie would spring from it, mind you the basic idea is about the only place a self-respecting sequel could go (this one comes close but doesn't really fit the bill). I have also heard people say that a dinosaur in the movie is completely fictional which is completely not true, they are all existing fossils being used in the 'size matters' school of creature feature. Viewers will note early on a small exchange between Grant and his pal noting that Spinosaurus was not on any of Ingens lists, concidering they could have got away with slotting Spiny in it's speculation as to why they drew attention to it but here's something to note. In the original, watch closely when Nedry is in the storage lab and note the names you can read as he fills up his pressure pack can, you will see Metriachanthosaurus (Met-ree-uh-canth-o-saurus) which is an earlier and smaller version of Spinosaurus (they are both in the Spinosaur family).This after seeing it seems small as a movie, not so much brief but just concise. If creature features are your gig, this one is a very traditional form of one and well worth seeing, also if it's some lavish dino action and thrills that your after look no further, it will bate your appetite until the inevitable JP4 arrives.7/10 "}{"Title":"Gimme More DINOS!","Date":"31 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" I didn't know what to expect when I first sat down before the movie started.

He had to be since there were no Nedry's or Ludlow's to worry about.

I guess in a way making sequels becomes infinitely harder to do as the surprise element is gone and it's especially true of the Jurassic Park series. Prior to the first movie, no had ever seen a dinosaur on screen so realistically portrayed and that element created a buzz. The subsequent movies had that `been there, done that' feel so where do you go from there? In this case (and Lost World) it means more dinosaurs, more gruesome scenes and more running, which isn't bad as long as you're not expecting anything more. This installment brings back Alan Grant (Sam Neil) with a bit of a cameo from Laura Dern. Other than that, the rest of the cast is basically new. The movie revolves around Grant being persuaded (promise of huge funding for his digs) by a couple to be their `dinosaur expert' on an alleged vacation fly-by of Isla Sorna (the island from the Lost World). Reluctantly Grant complies, mostly for monetary reasons, and he goes on this supposed fly-by with his research aid. Little does he know, the couple (played by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy) have plans of rescuing their young son who about a 2 weeks prior crash-landed while parasailing near the island and hasn't been heard from since. Grant soon discovers that he's been duped into something he has absolutely no interest in doing and basically does what he can to get off the island as quickly as he can. His morals kick in and he does the right thing but reluctantly. The storyline is there and was basically well told. Sam Neill has always been a superb actor and he does a very good job here but for some reason or other I felt it wasn't quite up to his level in the first movie. It might have something to do that he's really nothing more than a baby sitter to a bunch of ignorant city folk and if I were in his shoes would have left these people to fend for themselves if they displayed the level of ignorance they did. William H. Macy has always been a good actor and there really isn't a lot you can say negative about his performance, however, I've never been a big fan of Tea Leoni and she really doesn't do anything here for me. She portrays the distraught mother in search of her lost child but comes across dumber than a stick. Who in their right mind, knowing that they're on an island full of vicious prehistoric animals the size of large buildings, goes crashing through the forest aimlessly yelling?? Any sane person would never do that, no matter how distraught they were. Self-preservation would be the first instinct to kick in, especially after surviving a crash landing and a beating from a large vicious dinosaur. While I wasn't real fond of some of the human actors, the dinosaurs were pretty darn good. The special effects were quite well done and they didn't rely completely on CGI. The mechanic dinosaurs held their own and in a lot of ways made the scenes more real as the actors had something to work off of. I particularly liked the one scene where the mighty T-Rex fought the Spinosaur; something we really haven't seen in the other two movies and it gives us a bit of a possible look at what living back then would really be like. Overall, I liked it and would recommend it as a matinee but like I said in the beginning, it doesn't have that `Spielberg' feel to it even though he produced it.

The story is thin, there is very little build up of suspense, the ending is perfunctory, etc. etc. But unlike some many movies today which have such pretensions of grandeur, e.g. the awful  Mummy II, Planet of the Apes, to name two, Jurassic Park III really has no aim of being  a great science fiction story;  I beleive it was designed to be nothing but an adrenalin rush, and on that it delivers. The special effects are amazing, some of the dinosaur scenes really freaky and startling, the lighting, the entire look of the film, quite wonderful. The plot was improbable and illogical, but at least there was some humor, a minimum of sentiment, and at least the characters didn't annoy me.In a way, Jurassic Park is like one of the mindless monster movies of the 50's., updated to today's technology. No, Jurassic Park III is not a great movie, but it was a lot more honest and enjoyable than a lot of what I have seen this year.

I didn´t expect that many negative reviews. Ok the movie didn´t have me at the edge of my seat, but i truly believe that it doesn´t deserve to be described as trash.In my opinion the story isn´t that bad at all. Obviously they had to find a way of placing some people on one of the dinosaur islands and i think the way this happens is quite good. ( If you want to see a movie based upon a great story go watch the others - a ghost story with Nicole Kidman )The acting is pretty good throughout the whole film and especially Sam Neill and Duchovny wife Tea Leonie come up with a fine performance. Only Mr. Kurby seems to be in the wrong film. I liked his role in Boogie Nights, but since that film i have to laugh every time i see him. I just can´t take him seriously anymore -)Another thing many people dislike is that the T-Rex isn´t part of the cast anymore. Well that´s not too bad a thing. We already saw the Rex in the first two movies. As far as i am concerned that is enough. And i do think that he was replaced by some dinosaurs who were worth watching as well.There is plenty of action and the movie is defintely not too long.( 1 h 25 min. )But i have to admit that there are facts which separate J.P.III from very good movies. The dialogues are really bad and after the first 30 minutes the characters are basically running away all the time. I think they were running even more than good ol´ arnie and his friends in Running Man did.The story starts off alright, but isn´t developed during ther movie. And the end is absolutely horrible!!! I had a good laugh at that. Since i compose music myself i was disappointed by the score. Mr. Williams created such a great score for the first movie. Now some other guy is doing a remix of it. you do get to hear the theme from time to time, but it is always a bit different then the original one. That is a shame.So all in all i give   7/10.

I mean I knew JP III could not be much worse than The Lost World (what the heck did Crichton think when he wrote that book??? Probably &#145;If the first part was such a success and I would get that kind of money for a sequel I should come up with some more dino &#150; crap!'). And that was what he did. But the screen writers here actually came up with a pretty good concept.OK not all was good in this film. Michael Jeter (Udesky) was terribly cheesy (SPIOLERS AHEAD!!!) and I was terribly glad that my feeling he would die soon came true quickly. (SPOILERS END!!!) The rest of the cast was pretty OK with the exception of Laura Dern (Ellie) and Sam Neill (Dr. ALAN GRANT). Bringin those two back was a much better move than bringing Goldblum back, cause let's be honest Dern and Neill outplay Goldblum with their eyes closed and their hands behind their back. Those two are just great.In addition to that there were a few surprises in this movie (at least for me). (SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) Like in the beginning with Ellie and Alan, when I thought they were married but they were not. Or when I thought the chord to which the the paraglide was connected would break, (the zooming in on the chord gave me that impression), but it did not! (SPOILERS END).Another good thing about this movie were the effects. OK they were not as groundbreaking as in the original but they were good. The new dinosaurs all looked good. The fighting scenes were good (although not very bloody (TOO BAD)). I really like the Pteranodons (big dinosaur birds) they had in this film they were great. Just as the direction by Joe Johnston. I mean he created a good film with some really cool shots and even 2 scenes that reminded me of the original Jurassic Park. The ending scene and the scene with the boat and the herd of dinosaurs in the end. Those were really scenes that made this film surpass the stupid rip &#150; off Lost World (I leave the Jurassic Park part out on purpose). Better actors in leading or supporting roles and more epic scenes. Though as complimenting as I might be now, there were bad things too. Like in the ending, the way everyone was &#145;rescued'. Way too fictional and overblown. But the ending shots made up for that.After the huge success of Jurassic Park (over 900 Million dollars worldwide), The Lost World (over 600 Million dollars worldwide) and this one (which will probably pull about 410 Million Dollars Worldwide) there is no doubt there will be a fourth installment. I do not need it, but I will watch it (probably) if I like the Trailer, but only under one condition. Bring back Sam Neill and Laura Dern and please let them share more time together on &#150; screen. THANKS (for NOTHING???)!!!!

I honestly didn't believe that after JP-2 Hollywood could retread the same basic plot again, namely crazed Dinos chasing humans. However, this serial film is one of the few that I've seen that hasn't been more absurd than its predecessor, two exceptions were the Star Trek and Star Wars series. As a rule, most multi-sequels don't follow an intelligent formula and rely on cheap thrills or laughs to get by. JP-3 is actually fairly original, and viewers can catch on quickly even if they've never seen the first or second installments. It's got a fair number of frights and shrieks, and of course at least one idiot who you actually want to see get eaten whole.

Aside from a brief mention at the beginning, the San Diego T-Rex fiasco was avoided, and instead JP3 focuses where it should A jungle-island with lots of big dinosaurs chasing little people. And it sure is fun!No analyzation of the directing, because it's not really anything to be noted (which is good, don't distract from the dinos). No analyzation of the acting, because with Neill, Leoni and Macy, you know you're gonna get good performances in roles that don't require much else. No analyzation of the plot, because it simply doesn't exist.JP3 holds true more to the originals' flare of just sitting back and enjoying the dinosaurs. Granted, the original truly is a horror/thriller classic, with great acting/directing/plot, some truly memorable scenes, and an idea that had never been done in such a way before. But the novelty is gone, and Spielberg and Co. realized that inventing new places for dinos to roam just didn't work. So back to the basics. Jurasic Park III isn't a classic movie of course. It certainly isn't as good as the original. But it is much better than the second one (Much like the Scream trilogy the 3d is done in a self-parody type of style that makes it much more enjoyable to watch). So give it a watch, but don't analyze it, please, because it just isn't that kind of flick (although I must say the end is just so incredibly tacked-on and off the wall).7/10 "},{"Title":"Good film, bad ending.","Date":"10 August 2001","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Sam Neill is one of the best actors in existance and he even manages to out do his performance in the original film.

And though this may be the least scientifically accurate one, it is still a great, short blast of fun.Following the legendary Jurassic Park and the critically panned The Lost World Jurasssic Park (my personal favorite in the series), Joe Johnston directs this short, quickly paced, and very fun dinosaur movie.  With an okay premise, simple and understandable characters, and the always excellent presence of Sam Neil and William H. Macy, Johnston directs the movie like a good old fashioned Ray Harryhausen film.The story takes place after Isla Sorna (Site B) has been made public, and the world knows dinosaurs are now alive and well.  And of course, like anything interesting and extremely dangerous, stupid tourists want to see them!  Such is the case when the son (Trevor Morgan) of a divorced couple (Macy and Tea Leoni) goes sailing around Isla Nublar with his mom's new boyfriend.  Naturally, as is the case of anyone going near dinosaurs or trying to videotape Godzilla, they end up getting stranded on the island. Talk about bang for your buck.Enter Alan Grant.  Still digging in the hot Bad Lands for fossils, he's strapped for grant money.  So Macy and Leoni ask him to be a tour guide while they fly over Site B, never mentioning their true intentions of landing and looking for their son.So, despite the best of common sense from Grant, the plane lands, is attacked, and you've got a few really unlucky people on the worst place in the world.The film moves quickly, and is about 20-30 minutes shorter than the previous two.  I preffered the more dramatic aspects of the series, but I loved the atmosphere of quick adventure and fun this movie brings.  It works in a Ray Harryhausen kind of way.As a dinosaur enthusiast, I'm also glad to see more dinosaurs (though I still love T-Rex more than anything but Allosaurus).  We get Pteranodons (NOT pterodactyls!), a quick cameo of what I'm pretty sure is a Ceratasaurus, and the well hyped Spinosaurus.The scenes with these dinosaurs are excellent (even though the Ceratosaurus bit is really just a joke).  The Pteranodons attack, the Spinosaurus's introduction and finale, all are very tense and executed well on screen.However, there are, naturally, some setbacks.  And if any of you say plot holes and characterization, go watch American Beauty.  This is a dinosaur action movie damnit, not a serious drama!The main problem for me is that the suspense is somewhat killed when a 40 foot long dinosaur can't catch up to a group of mindlessly scrabbling humans.  That's what, among other things, I loved about the Lost World lots more dinosaur food.  They manage to stay far ahead of the Spinosaurus (except on water), and it loses its thrill.  Luckily, this doesn't happen in any scene with the pteranodons and the velociraptors.Which, however, is another problem.  Although the T-Rex is traded in for the Spinosaurus, the velociraptors are abundent, which is the problem.  We've seen plenty of the velociraptors in the previous two, and trying to make them more intelligent and altering their looks for this outing just doesn't cut it.  I would suggest more of the aforemention ceratosaurus.But my big complaints is really just nit-picking scientific details, so its nothing big.  The fact is that this movie is really quite less acurate to common theories on dinosaurs than the previous two.  For one thing, i doubt a Pteranodon would go after something so large as a human when its mouth is designed to catch fish, or feed an healthy teenager to its young.And for the hyped up Spino vs. T-Rex fight, the Rex would've one easily. While the Spino is bigger than the Rex, its only by about 4 feet in length. And while the Spino did have a longer head and bigger hands, it was much more lightly built than a Rex or even an allosaurus.  Its teeth weren't designed for taking down large, struggling prey, its jaws were weakers, and the Spinosaurus's trademark spine is a giant weakness.  It would have been easily damaged during a fight with any large prey.  The Rex was more muscular, had teeth and a jaw designed to crush bone, binocular vision, excellent sense of smell, and a brain twice the size of the Spinosaurs, Acrocanthosaurus, or Giganotasaurus.  Spino was just there because it looked cool.Still, the fight was cool, but not up to anything Ray Harryhausen has done.Overall, this is a well, but not excellently, made diosaur action movie. And just the words Dinosaur Movie make me want to see it again.  I'd give it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.

A sequel was definitely inevitable...Then, in 1997, The Lost World Jurassic Park was released. It was a big disappointment, because the characters were mainly flat, boring and uninteresting. People craved for more, and the franchise lay dormant and silent for a while, no word coming out whether or not there will be a third installment in the mega franchise...Come 2001. A THIRD movie is released, entitled  Jurassic Park 3. It was one of the few chosen saving graces of this summer season, and it does its job with an energetic passion.Jurassic Park 3 had one of the biggest July openings ever, raking in $19 million in its first day. Although it basically had a nonexistent plot, JP3 was saved by its dark atmosphere, bloody deaths, aggressive leading dinosaur, and tension-wracked suspense.JP3's plot is simple. A divorced couple, hire Dr.  No force on earth or heaven could get me to return on that island, Grant and his assistant Billy Brennan to look for their son on Isla Sorna. You'll later learn that the Kirbys, as the couple is called, had to trick Grant and Billy by offering them a blank check. They also aren't billionaires. Anyway, things go wrong as the film's new bad guy, the Spinosaurus, attacks them aggressively. He even kills the T-Rex just because he wants to chase them!They now have to get out of the island and, in the process, rescue the Kirby's son, Eric.JP3 had very good graphics. This is also one of the more positive aspects of the film. The Spino-Rex Fight was done perfectly, but I wish it was extended. It was only 30 seconds long, and I think audiences need a more elaborate fight to see.Overall, Jurassic Park 3 is a great summer blockbuster that's worth your dollar.

While the plot isn't too good, the movie is pretty entertaining. I heard that the movie was the darkest and most violent in the series, but after seeing it, I hardly agree. I think the first is the most violent (and darkest for what the series is). I expected to just see dinosaurs chasing, fighting eachother, and eating people... but it almost seemed like they didn't have enough of that. Well... there was a lot of chasing, but in terms of eating people or anything else, the movie was a letdown. The hyped up Spinosaurus vs. T-Rex fight was a disappointment, and was about 15 seconds long. I expected the Spinosaurus to be truly frightening... to dwarf the T-Rex in comparison of being scary and mean... and although he did cause some suspense, he didn't gather up nearly enough to compare to the first JP. I don't know... maybe the effect has worn off after 2 movies. Or maybe it was the cell phone thing that killed the element of suprise. There also wasn't enough extras to be eaten. While the Spinosaurus, Raptors, and Pterodactyles were good FX, everything else seemed to need work.I actually liked all the characters with the exception of Tea Leoni, who was extremely annoying. I was at a point where I wanted to see her get chomped. I blame it mostly on the writers.Despite all the negative aspects I've mentioned, the movie is entertaining in being more of a tv pilot than an epic summer action. It was like this week on JP the series, we find out that the raptors can talk to eachother.I still give it a 6.5, or 7 out of 10.

There are many reviews out there criticizing this film for its lack of plot and character development, but that's nitpicking. The simple fact is that Jurassic Park 3 is a fun film. It's no work of art, just a good, thrilling 90-minute ride that delivers all the goods.The second sequel has Dr. Grant going along with a divorced couple to find their son, who has disappeared somewhere in Isla Sorna, an island populated by dinosaurs. They crash land their plane and the inevitable dinosaur carnage ensues, with all of the minor supporting characters getting eaten very quickly. The surviving group soon has to battle vicious raptors (who can now communicate with each other, in order to set up elaborate traps for the human victims) and battle with the gigantic Spinosaur, who is even more deadly than the T-Rex. As you could probably tell from the summary, the film doesn't waste too much time with plot. It goes full bore into the action and doesn't let up. The most exciting sequence in the film is when the group stumbles into a giant birdcage for pteranodons. This part of the film is very intense, and the flying dinosaurs are truly menacing. Another highlight of the film was the Spinosaur, a huge and frightening dino that provides for some tense scenes. Sam Neill returning as Alan Grant helped, and they don't turn his character into a soppy mess as they did with Ian Malcolm in The Lost World. One other thing I appreciated was that the kid didn't turn out to be some obnoxious plot device, like the girl in Lost World. You actually like the kid.Let us now compare two movies JP3 and Tomb Raider. Both films have the same apparent distaste for plotting and story, and both films have several plot holes and confusing moments. The only difference is that Tomb Raider was boring as all hell, and Jurassic Park 3 was exciting. This is the way to make a summer movie. I could harp on and on about the inconsistencies in the script or the flaws in the plot, but I don't need to because the action scenes pay off, and I was entertained. And that's all that matters.

There were numerous new dinos to look at and study as well as new characters, Dr. Grant and Ellie being the only familiar ones.

Like most sane people, I loved the first Jurassic Park.  And, also like most sane people, I didn't care for the second. It was a real shame they screwed that up because the book was so good.  Eh, I'll save that rant for another review.  But, when I was going into Jurassic Park 3, I wasn't expecting much.  I knew the story would be about as flat as paper and the characters would suck.  Well, I was right.Ask yourself, what was wrong with JP2?  I'll tell you.  The movie had too many characters with too many motives and had a plot with a hundred pointless turns.  The thing that made Jurassic Park work so well was the situation.  A bunch of people in a theme park attacked by the attractions.  The added plus was the attractions were dinosaurs.  The second movie has a bunch of people going to another island for no real reason.  Okay, there was reason, but it was still stupid.This is where JP3 comes in.  Grant does not want to go to the island.  In fact, he's kidnapped (which is the only good plot twist in this movie).  Once the movies gets to the island, a giant chase sequence begins.  I heavily enjoyed this movie because it showed us more dinosaurs with less plot.  The Lost World tried to camouflage the stupid situation with a complex plot.  But Jurassic Park III never tries that.  It knows how stupid it is.  Basically here's the movie People get on the island, dinosaurs chase people, people get off the island.  Oh come on, you know there is a happy ending.  I won't tell you who lives and dies though.The fun of this movie is not the plot; it's the TERRIFIC dinosaur action.  This movie takes a more realistic look at the dinosaurs and a scarier one too.  The special effects are amazing.  One of the greatest scenes in the movie happens in the beginning when a T-Rex (everyone's favorite carnivore) gets into a fight with a Spinosaur (a much bigger dinosaur I have never heard of).  The camera moves around the fighting beasts in a handheld shot, panning 360 degrees.  I must say, I was worried about ILM with the Mummy Returns's crappy special effects, but they have REALLY redeemed themselves now.  The Pterodactyl sequences are equally amazing.So, in conclusion, this is not a movie for you Film Scholar people who think Brazil and Dark City are the greatest movies ever made.  This isn't for you hip writers who think David Mamet is God.  This is for the average Joe who wants to see some Dinosaurs eat some people.  I am a huge action movie fan, and let me tell you, this movie has some of the most breathtaking action sequences I have ever seen.  I have two sides to me the film side and the movie side.  The film side is the guy who likes Mamet, David Fincher, and other artistic stuff.  The movie guy loves good popcorn movies.  Believe it or not, they were both impressed with JP3.  The film guy was amazed at the camera work and special effects work while the movie guy was just impressed by the cool dinos. Sure the beginning and ending suck.  Sure it has an unbelievable plot twist (it involves the kid, but I'm not telling you what it is).  Sure the dialog is horrible and the characters (other than Grant) are stupid.  But the whole movie isn't made for these things.  It is made to impress you with cool dino action.  I was also impressed how the movie manages to make fun of itself and it's predecessors.  Several satirical jokes are made that I found rather amusing.  So, in final conclusion, if you don't like this movie, well, you're no fun. Oh, PS this isn't a kids movie, folks.  I know JP and JP2 were family friendly, but this one isn't.  The dinosaurs are extremely realistic, so just think about that.  Real dinosaurs aren't like Barney; they're monsters and I can guarantee your kid (5 yr to 10 yr) will be scarred for life if you take him into this.  This is more of a horror movie than an adventure movie. There were several small girls in my theater when I saw this, and boy-howdie did they cry and moan, Are the dinos coming back!?  Don't let them come back mommy!.  Oh, and don't take them to AI either.

THE LOST WORLD JURASSIC PARK infuriated me in MANY ways with it's bad casting, bad characters, PC pushing, and terrible ending. JURASSIC PARK III, however, was a very pleasant surprise. It is the JURASSIC PARK II that should have been.It IS, of course, not as good as JP, but then again there is NO way any sequel could be. There is NO way you can break the ground twice. JP was a ground-breaking movie. You just cannot do that again, no matter how great the effects are this time around (which they ARE better than JP). JP III DOES follow up the first one in ways the second movie didn't. Allan Grant is back. He was my favorite character in the first one so having him back makes this one (unlike TLWJP) feel like a Jurassic Park movie. The sense of awe is back briefly with the initial fly-over of Isla Sorna and when the group is on the river. What is also back is the JP Theme by John Williams. TLWJP DID have the JP Theme for a few seconds after the John Hammond scene and in the end credits, but it needed it throughout, like JP III. One of the big reasons the first one was so good was because of the music, which (like Spielberg's directing) I feel Mr. Williams was very off in the second movie. Seeing the pteranadons FINALLY make an appearance in a JP movie (they were in the original book) was VERY good. YES, they WERE REAL creatures, though NOT actually dinosaurs. It was also great to see the Spinosaurus (also a REAL creature). I'm glad to see someone FINALLY showing that there were carnivorous dinosaurs OTHER than T-rex. Ellie Sattler was also good to see back. I liked her purpose in the movie as Allan's guardian-type. I WAS sad to see that she and Grant were not together, though. I feel the only problem with this movie was it's length (which I've noticed MANY other people had a problem with). The film DID seem a tad rushed in a few places, but I think it's all-around fine. What we really want to see in a JP movie are the dinosaurs, not build-up and resolution. Let's not fool ourselves. TLWJP and JP III ARE action movies. I don't believe the first one should be put in the action genre, but second two should and that's OK. Again, what do we expect? And, again, you can't break the ground twice.One question, though When Erik says to Grant Billy was right, what in the world was he talking about? What was Billy right about? They never say. Oh, well. Not important, I guess.Overall I give JP 10/10, TLWJP a 2/10, and JP III an 8-9/10. JP III is worth seeing.

How many times have you gone to a movie and had a life altering experience? It didn't actually change my life, but it certainly altered my perspective on technology. When I went to J.P.I in the summer of 1993, those were real dinosaurs up there on the screen. Of course, I knew they were really just movie magic, but that night it was mighty easy to believe in magic. My favorite thing about J.P.I was the sensitivity portrayed between the key characters. The Allen Grant character interacting with Laura Dern, and especially with the kids. Then they had sarcastic Jeff Goldblum playing against the sensitivity, which made him very funny and enjoyable to watch. But, make no mistake about it. It was the heart in that movie that made it so wonderful. A few years later, J.P.II came along. What was that all about? Spielberg went with the sarcasm of Goldblum to make the movie work. What was he thinking? You figure a person like Spielberg knows what he's doing, and then you find out he may well have been flying blind after all. So, what's good about J.P.III? The monsters are good, especially the flying ones. The sense of humor is pretty good. Allen Grant exudes the sensitivity that is so important to make these J.P. movies work. Macy is the bomb. I & II have wonderful characters. What's wrong with III? I think they really missed the boat with the fear factor. In J.P.I, everyone on the island understood what a tremendously scary situation they were in, and they convinced me! It was not the scary dinosaurs that invoked the terror in me, it was the terror I felt from the human characters. In J.P.III it was just wrong that, unless there was a dinosaur breathing in their face, most the characters seemed oblivious to their dire situation. My son said the movie wasn't scary. Well, no wonder he felt that way when even the participants seemed to think they were merely hiking through a boy scout camp, unless they happened upon a monster.

The dismissive remarks of young Eric about how preachy Malcolm's book on the dinosaurs was, which meets the approval of the returning Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is a beautiful in-joke puncturing of the hot-air balloons that weighed down Lost World.

What wasn't inevitable was that it would be any good. Thankfully, new director Joe Johnston has stepped into Uncle Steve's shoes to deliver a popcorn movie of the very highest calibre.The plot is at a bare minimum. A little kid and his step-dad go missing after hang-gliding over Isla Sorna, the island of dinos that we saw in The Lost World. Obviously, folks Tea Leoni and William H. Macy have not resigned themselves to the fact that their son has become dino food in the eight weeks they haven't seen him, and con Alan Grant (Sam Neill, reprising his role from the original Jurassic Park) into giving them a guided tour as they fly over the island. As you would expect, not everything goes to plan and the passengers are left to fend for themselves on an island crawling with nasty dinosaurs - more variety than ever before.Leaving out dragging plot which blighted The Lost World, Johnston has pulled out all the stops to deliver thrill after thrill as the ragtag bunch of characters try to get off the island alive. Essentially, the movie is a 1 and a half hour string of dinosaur set-pieces, with raptors, pteradons (winged things) and spinosaurs thrown into the mix, as well as some breathtaking landscapes and seamless special effects. What Johnston has achieved is no longer a special effect - these dinosaurs are real. They look real, move realistically and fight realistically. For once, you cannot differentiate between CGI and the real thing.William H. Macy and Sam Neill are superb in their roles as dorky, worried father and smooth, calm palaentologist, and elevate an otherwise average script to something much better. Tea Leoni is annoying as usual and survives one too many scrapes for my liking, but her son gives an irritation-free performance. The ending is a little convenient and the movie ends a bit abruptly, leaving you to wonder what happened to the last 20 minutes, but it allows you not to think about it too much and simply enjoy a 90-minute pure thrill ride.

It has just enough to make it a worthwhile film. Sam Neil is fantastic as is William H. Macy, the rest of the cast isn't awful either. The spinosaurus was a fantastic addition and most of the effects were phenomenal. The plot was engaging..... but something was missing.Another user commented that hollywood seems to see only as far as the bank and I would share this view. Watching JP3 reminded me in many respects of tomb raider. Every event we witnessed seemed a token of what could and maybe should have happened. Like tomb raider, JP3 comes across as nothing more than an extended trailer! The raptor plot was barely explored, events and characters from the previous two films were whispered in passing, the t-rex made one scene and that merely served to assert the dominance of the spino. Worst of all, the subversive intellectual plot lines from the first two dropped for an extremely cheesy and unnecessary family values plot saved only by Macy's convincing but strained performance.Apparently there were numerous re-writes of the script. It is easy to imagine that there was once perhaps a purely intellectual script and a purely adventure script. JP3 comes across as an incomplete amalgamation of the two, desperately trying to offer interesting twists (like where did the spino come from since it wasn't on Ingens list and why did no one come across it in the lost world?) but failing to deliver and instead offering up a platter of short scenes to the fidgety and easily bored MTV generation that make up the target audience.

The second one wasn't great either, but it was better than this.  JP III totally lacks the suspense of the first two (the first is one of the most edge-of-your-seat films ever), and very many elements of it are borrowed from other movies. Having just seen it about half an hour ago, I can recall one thing that came from the first JP, two things that came from the second, something out of Alien, and of course, a little Godzilla here and there.  Now of course, the special effects are fabulous.  Everything in JPIII looks great (with the possible exception of Tea Leoni's boring hairstyle.)   Yet at the same time, I came home from the theater and looked up spinosaurus and pteranadon in the dictionary to make sure these were real animals that actually lived on earth once.  They were, but somehow these things looked like something made up for a movie (not to mention the bit about the velociraptors being able to talk to each other and possibly be smarter than dolphins or even us.)  These things may indeed be factual based on all current paleontological research, but I think it was safer to use average-intelligence velociraptors, and T-Rexes and other familiar species that don't appear quite so... mythological.  Despite the great CGI effects, I somehow felt from time to time like I was watching a dinosaur movie from the 1960s.   I appreciated all the actors; I'm glad Sam Neill was back, and I wish Laura Dern had had a bigger role.  The newcomers did well (but heaven forbid that children young enough for Sesame Street should see this movie and witness Mr. Noodle getting mauled by a raptor!)  There is also virtually no profanity, which is a definite plus.  The absence of Jeff Goldblum makes this JP a lot less funny that the others, but there are a few very clever humorous moments. But the plot is rather uninspired, disjointed, and the movie is amazingly short.  It's eye candy and excitement, but no real thrills, at least compared to the other two.  And then there's that abrupt ending.  It left me saying to myself, Is that it?  This is not good for a movie with Jurassic Park in its title. Spielberg didn't direct this one, and I think it shows. Maybe III is simply enough, or maybe if there's a IV (which I'm sure there will be), we should hope that Spielberg directs it, and hope for a better story and two full hours to tell it.

But the raptors aren't computerize and they look and move like a real lizard. The scientists still disagree with how them raptors should behave, but at this point those things are just opinions.One of the thing I truly love the most (a little bit of spoilers) is that T-Rex is no longer the big bad dino. There is a new bigger and more powerful than T-Rex and its fighting scene with T-Rex is just amazing (whose the victor of the fight you should probably can all ready guess.

But then as time went on and I saw footage, I was very impressed. And now, after watching a sneak preview of it at my work tonight, I still am impressed. The sequences with the dinosaurs are effective and jolting. The raptors are truly as awesome as ever. The new spinosaurus is also quite scary, and the pteranodons are WICKED. The scenes with them are truly new and something not seen before. Showing the young boy attacked by the baby pteranodons was freaky and makes you shiver. My favorite scenes will always be those involving the raptors, because they are the most vicious and therefore the most satisfying in these kinds of movies. My only complaint - which is very small - is that this film didn't have ENOUGH chase scenes. It had a lot, it's true, and all of them were very impressive, but I still left feeling like there should have been MORE, LONGER chase and strategy scenes. Scenes like in Lost World where Ian is fighting a raptor off in the car while Sarah and Kelly are digging away in the barn, then Ian races from the car into the glass room, the raptor jumps through, Ian races into the barn and fends off another one...Scenes like this where it was nonstop Watch out!..WATCH OUT! OH!! WATCH OUT!! True, the raptor scenes in Jurassic 3 were the best in the film, where Alan stands, turns around and comes FACE TO FACE with one, and then suddenly he's surrounded.

NO it doesn't have a moving storyline, nor complex character development. Did you really expect it to?I'll admit I'm a bit of a movie elitist, often looking down on my friends when they jet off on a Friday night to see the brand new blockbuster. And they look down on me when i try and convince them that subtitles aren't all that bad.  But i was excited about this movie.  I was excited because i had no expectations whatsoever (after The Lost World, who could?).  No, wait, i did have one expectation i wanted to see dinosaurs run amok and eat people. If you go to the theater expecting that, i promise you won't be disappointed.  Let's face it folks, Jurassic Park is dead.  With the first film an action film icon, and the second one the butt of all sequel jokes, Joe Johnston had quite a job ahead of him.  How could a director pit his action scenes up against the same man who did Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Jurassic Park?  It's impossible.  So instead of going to this film and constantly comparing every nuance to Chrichton's dinos, or Spielberg's directing, just relax, pop a few Valium, and watch dinos attack things and munch on people. I did, and i came away feeling ok.I enjoyed the pterodactyl scene very much, it was probably the best action sequence in the film.  Johnston manages to orchestrate some suspense while at the same time introducing a new dinosaur that doesn't try to out do the others.  That was the reason the new Spinosaurus lacks some chutzpah, because he's just a meaner T-Rex with a different snout.  Ah, but flying dinosaurs we haven't dealt with yet. There's several lighter moments which actually don't hurt the film, as well as a handful of references to the past two films which keeps the fans interested.  True, the plot's thin, as well as the characters, but Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is a much more enjoyable (and believable) protagonist than The Lost World's Ian Malcom (Jeff Goldblum).  I would say that a rugged paleontologist has a better reason to be facing off against dinos than a quirky mathmatician.So if you're dead set on spending the afternoon watching something intellectually stimulating and though provoking, better not see this movie. But if your eyes have started to hurt from subtitles, and you've had a strange desire to see large lizards create panic and terror, then this is the movie for you.

The raptors are advertised intelligent in the this film, making it a large point to note they're ability to communicate. And evidence supports in favor that deinonychus, which has to be what the Jurassic Park movies are portraying as velociraptors, were capable of this. Furthermore I believe it's the first time one of the dinosaurs were actually a main character. An argument could be made about that but personally I believe a true main character has to show intelligence and emotion. The iconic T-Rex in the previous films was just an animal, a supporting character at best, which is okay and it was entertaining. Speaking of, dispatching Tyrannosaurus was bold, daring, and took on a lot of criticism but I think it paid off, making room for a real predator. Acting was decent and the plot was fine, despite taking major fire from a lot of people. All and all a good film, don't let poor ratings shy you away, this film is definitely fun. My theory, just because it wasn't exactly the same thing people wanted to burn its reputation and found reason not to like it that just aren't there.

But soon after they land on the island, their plane gets destroyed in an accident. Will they find the boy; and more importantly will they be able to safely get off this dangerous island?Review After directing the first two blockbusters of this money- spinning franchise, Steven Spielberg decided to hand over the reigns to his protégé Joe Johnston for the third installment. Neither was Michael Crichton commissioned to write another novel to form the basic premise of this film. Although his unforgettable themes are still present, but even the maestro John Williams also vacated his place. So, does the magic diminish? Certainly not!'Jurassic Park III' is clearly intended to be just a terror experience; which could be the reason for Spielberg opting out, who generally specializes in life-altering cinematic creations. Yet, considering 'The Lost World' had failed to meet his towering standards; JPIII with less expectation doesn't do badly at all. The scenario here is grimmer; the arrivers fewer and less resourceful and the time spent on the island the maximum. All this contributes into building a sense of heightened danger making it the most terrifying film of this franchise.JPIII has a running time of just 90 minutes; unlike its prequels which were nearly 130 minutes long. Although that severely cuts down on the fun; it's still better than TLW where not much happened despite a longer duration. At least to compensate for it, the real 'fun' (struggle for survival) begins much earlier than the previous two. Due to its length the story never gets the scope to expand and clearly the script isn't the strength of this flick; unlike the prequels. That's the difference between adapting a literary work and manufacturing a screenplay.Although the script borrows some of the many unused sequences from Crichton's previous novels, why couldn't the run-time be extended by incorporating more such scenes is beyond me. There are a couple of doubts in the plot; but those aren't gaping loopholes like in TLW.One interesting aspect of this franchise has been the discussions among the central characters which are often as engaging as the thrills. JPIII doesn't disappoint on this front either, as there are quite a few engrossing conversations among the leads often laced with the characteristic humor. Ironically,one of the main points of interest in this film was the intelligence of Raptors. But disappointingly the Raptors hardly inject the same amount of terror this time. With the T- Rex only making a cameo appearance, two of the most feared dinosaurs of the franchise hardly create an impression here.But impression is certainly created by the newcomers and previous side- players. The Spinosaurus replaces the T-Rex as the chief-terrorist of this film. Not only does it vanquish a T-Rex to assert its superiority; it swoops down on its prey to crash the visitors flight and then literally crushes it into a piece of log, it breaks through a wooden fence and even swims underwater to wreck the survivors' boat. Needless to say all these sequences are nerve-wracking! But special mention has to be made of the Pteranodon which till now only featured in the concluding scene of the two prequels. Even here it repeats its act by soaring into the clouds to create the most beautiful ending of this franchise. But it also finally gets the opportunity to show its 'talent' in the terrific bird-cage sequence. It's easily the highlight of this film.But more than the dinosaurs, the heart & soul of JPIII is the one & only Sam Neill as Allan Grant, who was sorely missed in TLW. Returning eight years after he stole our hearts in Jurassic Park; he looks a bit aged but still retaining the same old charm and aura of dependability. Wearing his trade-mark hat he delivers some of the funniest lines with a straight face; and with the same expression he stands composed in the face of extreme danger. With his large eyes which speak volumes, he scans not only the hidden dangers present in the surroundings but also the hidden truths in the human minds. He once again becomes the epitome of dependence, the lone hope for the survivors to escape these creatures. This was exactly what Jeff Goldblum, as Ian Malcolm lacked in TLW. Neill single-handedly raises the bar a few notches for this film; as without him there are doubts if this film would have worked at all. Trevor Morgan as Eric, who reminds of a certain Daniel Radcliff, impresses by putting in a performance more matured than his age.JPIII would always remain special to me, as despite being the last film of the franchise till date, it was the first film of the trilogy which I had the fortune to witness. Watching captivated in a theatre, I still remember the sequences which had captured my imagination some 12 years back. Ironically, the dream sequence in the plane was my first introduction with a dinosaur sending a momentary chill down my spine! But the sight of 'real' dinosaurs scurrying in herds beneath the plane generated a gasp of 'dinosaurs!' from my wide-opened mouth. Similarly, the scene of the Spinosaurus staring from the woods, with the ring-tone of a satellite phone in the backdrop; made for a really eerie feeling. Last but not the least, the spectacle of the herds of Brachiosaurus staring down from the skies, remains my favorite scene from the film; just like the similar classic sequence from JP.'Jurassic Park III' as a cinematic experience doesn't come anywhere near 'Jurassic Park'. But as a terror movie it certainly fulfills its objectives better than 'The Lost World'. Only one request to the makers of 'Jurassic Park 4'; please get Sam Neill back, even if he is 66 at that time!

In saying as such, we mean to point out that rather than enchanted monkeys on motorbikes popping up here and there to cause strife, Raptors capable of educated guesses are the ingredients; rather than late-19th Century Big Game hunter Van Pelt appearing here and there for the odd skirmish, an extraordinarily large dinosaur in the form of a Spinosaurus comes along at varying times to cause havoc and serious damage. The first one worked well as a pot boiling thriller, especially when all the electronics went off and we essentially saw mankind stripped bare of its modernity thus thrust back into a primitive state of existence wherein it was forced into confronting a very real, albeit prehistoric, threat of dinosaurs. Toss in an ample slice of characterisation involving its lead and his forced exposure to dealing with his pet hate, that of kids, as well as having to battle against a would-be romance between an apparent rival and the woman he's dating, and you had something which worked to a decent level on the array of strands it headed down.The second veered off and away from the beaten path too much and for too long to actually enjoy, with the third bringing it right back down to Earth in its providing a director, in Joe Johnston, whose ability to deal with causality driven monsters/beasties/threats/episodic chaos is proved, sees him do the business with a film set on a tropical dystopia following an array of people ill equipped to deal with what they're facing. There are no superfluous company-come-conglomerates takeover sub plots; there are no city-set Godzilla homages, nor indeed are there too many characters to get busy depicting.As was with the second film, we open with a child and their relative where they ought not be &#x96; enjoying themselves in the vicinity of a dinosaur infested island somewhere in Central America. Here is the, by now, obligatory sequence featuring the dinosaurs misbehaving at the bereft of a bystander; the film's first instance of it neatly syncing up with 1993's Jurassic Park in its refusing to show the beasts but getting across their threat via a young boy named Erik (Morgan) and his foster-father's illegal parasailing ride over restricted waters. The ride goes wrong, and both Erik and the guardian end up crash landing on the nearby island populated by the very dinosaurs they sought to catch a glimpse of whilst riding high in the skies. Cut to a number of weeks later, and Sam Neill's Alan Grant is still good friends with Laura Dern's character from the first film. Neill makes a welcome return as the film's lead; as its anchorman, his low tone and worn features pleasingly replacing that of Goldblum's sardonic put-downs; monosyllabic understatements and generally neurotic presence driving the last.Grant is the last of his dying breed, and continues to dig for fossils as well as speak publicly on an array of issues linked to his practise, in spite of the fact events from the first two films dog his career reiterating a real resentment to what he was caught up in. With money to fund these digs and fossil extractions in short supply, enter William H. Macy's businessman Paul Kirby, with his wife Amanda (Leoni) in tow, and a proposition which would see Grant come out with a large cash sum if he were to take them close to where that Central American island from the first dinosaurs are.Things take a change for the worse from here on in, with ulterior motives possessed by the Kirby's and their mercenaries becoming clearer &#x96; one question we ask ourselves is as to why the Kirby's appear to take Grant out in the evening, with the proposition in mind, to a seedy looking pool hall/diner bar establishment when they're seemingly a lot richer. The party of around half a dozen, as well as Alessandro Nivola's character Billy - a good friend of Grant's, end up stranded on an island once upon a time more inclined to dinosaurs as a means of experimentation than entertainment; an array of new beasts and improved older ones propping up the means for conflict. Trueer intentions for being there rear up in the form of the reveal that Erik is the Kirby's son, Grant more interested in getting off the island and home than anything else but there is room for meagre characterisation in the form of the fact the Kirby's are actually estranged and here find time to get back together; Billy gets a shot at redemption after he makes some poor decisions of his own and there is pleasing room for Grant to revisit his child orientated prejudices from the first film when he gets to bond with Erik before anyone else and discovers what good company he actually is.The film is ultimately mere spectacle, something driven by an engine of episodic causality and often fun action. Much was once made of the Spinosaurus &#x96; I recall DVD extras going on and on at length about its design; the thing a huge dinosaur unlike any other and the chief foil to that of the characters getting away safely. There is a poignant early instance of the Spinosaurus coming face to face with and fighting the T-Rex, with the 2001 vintage eventually overcoming both the classes of '93 and'97; but is the film any better because of the Spinosaurus' presence? Would it be any better or worse had it just been the T-Rex popping up here and there like before? Irregardless, dressing up old models is the farthest one feels one can go in criticising it because it is a good, clean honest crack and is difficult to get as riled about as one did about The Lost World.

Joe Johnston, a more than capable director himself, stepped in delivered a decent timewaster, but failed to give us anything new and didn't even bother to attempt an epic.Above and beyond all things, what cripples Jurassic Park 3 the most is the brief running time. The film fades out at the 84-minute mark, which is just unacceptable. The previous films were epics and both clocked in at over 2 hours. Why on earth did Universal take their biggest franchise at the time and cut it down to this? It beggars belief. The film feels like a TV pilot more than it does a cinematic event.Strange since the budget was $30 million higher than Jurassic Park in 1993. But the effects have improved drastically in that 8 year gap. I was never too keen or impressed with the CGI in the first film. The dinosaurs just didn't look right, but if you dared to criticize the film at the time you would have been shouted down.A lot of story concepts came and went before they, unimaginatively, settled on a same again scenario with yet another extended chase on Isla Sorna. Some of the scenes are even recycled unused sequences that never made the final script edit in the first two. At least they brought back Sam Neill as Alan Grant and had a small role for Laura Dern. William H. Macy provides great support too. It's good to see him do action for a change. And the kid in this one is far, far, far less aggravating than those annoying brats in the original film.John Williams didn't return, instead leaving the scoring chore Don Davis who made an adequate, if hardly memorable, attempt. All the good stuff is Williams' themes from the other movies. And since he made a few themes for this one I will assume that any noteworthy cues within were actually Williams' contributions, and not Davis', who I have never really liked.The action IS brilliantly done though, and the Spinosaurus, the new villain is quite scary. But just as it builds up to a big showdown,the film just...stops. What were they thinking? There's no payoff, no defining money shot. It just ends! That is my biggest problem with JP3. The familiar plot, and the lack of originality are forgivable, but rolling the credits at 84 minutes is a joke.I still recommend it for the action, sound design and effects alone.

The Lost World Jurassic Park was a disappointment, however, and so is the third installment in the series, the pithily titled Jurassic Park III. Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), survivor of the first adventure, has continued his career as a paleontologist and reluctantly agrees to be a guide for Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Téa Leoni), a couple who wishes to make a trip to the dinosaur island and promise to fund Grant's researches if he comes along. It turns out they have more on their minds than just a sightseeing trip; much to Grant's chagrin. Of course, the members of the team consisting of Grant, the Kirbys, a few mercenaries and a young paleontologist named Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) get stuck on the island and have to fight for their lives to make it to the coast and call for help.At first it looks like Jurassic Park III could be a pretty decent movie Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) from the first movie is featured in a small role and there are no annoying kids squeaking all the time (at first, that is...). Unfortunately the movie soon becomes pretty much what I feared it would be running and screaming in the dark with no sense of amazement or adventure. The story doesn't waste much time for character development or pondering the justification of gene technology and just jumps straight into action. Well, action can be very entertainment when done right, but here it is nothing that wasn't already done better in the first films of the series &#x96; the sense of adventure is missing. The dinosaur effects aren't as amazing as in the first Jurassic Park (or at least they don't feel like that anymore), although the addition of Pteranodons and communicating Velociraptors is a cool idea even if the scenes aren't ultimately as exciting as they sound like. Maybe the most effective moment in the film is the sudden appearance of a Spinosaurus after a cell phone ringtone is heard faintly in its direction &#x96; more such moments of astonishment would have been needed to make the film a good adventure.While there are enjoyable things to be found in Jurassic Park III, such as the majestic score music (even though the best musical themes are recycled from the first movie) and the charisma of Sam Neill in the lead role, they just aren't enough to make the movie a truly worthy sequel to the first JP. The Lost World wasn't great either but at least it had the fun finale on the streets of San Diego, and whereas JP3 lacks such a climax, it may entertain action-adventure fans who accept the fact that it can't be as good as the original. Watch it if you liked The Lost World; otherwise, don't get your hopes up.

You get a mediocre adventure film like JP3. In my opinion, this movie didn't really need to be made. I feel it's existence actually taints the reputation of one of my favorite movie franchises; it's one of the most unnecessary sequels since 1989's The Fly II. This movie finds Alan Grant (Sam Neill) convinced by a suspicious married couple into taking them on a guided tour over Isla Sorna but their true motivations soon lead to the group becoming stranded on the island.The movie has a good cast but it doesn't seem to do it any good. Sam Neill reprises his role as Alan Grant from the first film but his performance almost seems wasted here. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni play Paul and Amanda Kirby, the married couple who convince Grant to lead them. Seriously, why is Macy wasting his time in this movie? I've got more respect for him; I like him as an actor and he deserves better than a lame/pointless sequel. Leoni REALLY got on my nerves. From the start, I was hoping to see her become dinner for the raptors if it meant I wouldn't have to listen to her screeching any longer. Michael Jeter, another actor I enjoy, is wasted in a minor role as the organizer of the expedition. With so many good actors in this film, I should've enjoyed it a bit more...As usual with the JP series, the dinosaurs look fantastic for the most part. I did find it kind of odd that somewhere between the first two movies and this one, the dinosaurs all seemed to evolve with colorful party patterns on their skin. The movie continues to introduce more and more dinosaurs, which I don't understand. How can different dinosaurs appear on the island with each visit? Is it really possible that the gatherer team from the first trip to Isla Sorna wouldn't have seen an ankylosaur? Or the spinosaurus? I refuse to believe that Malcolm's team could've wandered through the island as much as they did and NOT found this raging dinosaur...especially since he appears to be EVERYWHERE. Although, I did enjoy the addition of the pteranodons to the mix.The movie never really explains the spinosaur's sudden appearance other than an offhand comment from Grant claiming that it was one of InGen's secrets. I hate the idea of the spinosaur, if only because I feel it was brought in because director Joe Johnston wanted to make his JP film bigger than the previous. So, to outdo the previous two films and make his movie more extreme, he mysteriously brings in this spinosaurus and even throws in a battle between the spinosaurus and a tyrannosaurus so he can show the audience, See! My dinosaurs BIGGER and SCARIER than your T-Rex!. I was let down with the concept from the spinosaur's first appearance.JP3 isn't a BAD film, it's just menial. There is nothing special about it. The cast, while it has it's share of good actors, feels wasted on a lame story. There were more than a couple instances when I felt the story was weakened the unexplained incident in the opening, the escape from the island, and the fate of Grant's assistant, Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola). It's a story with enough plot holes and frustration that I felt it single-handedly killed a franchise.

Johnston's direction is very mediocre here for the film completely lacks the excitement of its predecessors, which were skilfully helmed by Spielberg.The technical aspects are polished to an extent but despite the advancement in technology over the years, it appears quite inferior to the previous chapters. Production design team continues to impress with their well-detailed set pieces, Cinematography encapsulates the film with similar ambiance of its predecessors yet the usual intensity is deeply missing this time & Editing isn't up to the mark either.Despite its 93 minutes of runtime, the story becomes static at various moments & since the character arc is nearly non-existent, it doesn't help the cause either. The film also removes the mighty T-Rex from the central position it held in the series so far, going for Spinosaurus this time which never really looks intimidating enough. The raptors are as vicious as ever, feature a slightly modified design but their behaviour is much exaggerated.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Téa Leoni & others, and all of them are as lifeless as their respective characters. Even the dinosaurs are lacking the magnetic screen presence they had in the earlier chapters for Spinosaurus isn't a worthy successor to T-Rex, Raptors are actually close to speaking in human dialects plus the sequence involving Pteranodons is possibly the only cool stuff in the picture.On an overall scale, Jurassic Park III is an unrefined, unnecessary & uninspired continuation of the saga that shouldn't have been disturbed in the first place. While the die-hard fans of the original & dinosaur aficionados might find something redeemable here, there's simply no denying that most of it is a boring ride. Lacking the creativity, imagination & wonderment of its predecessors, Jurassic Park III is a highly inferior sequel that brings its uncooked meal in an already degrading package.

Its sense of awe and wonder, and of course the velociraptors are what mad me love the first film. Obviously I was excited at the prospect of there being a third film, but when I saw it in the cinema I couldn't be more disappointed. Firstly, the whole feel of the film was different from the first two, simply because the direction duties went to Joe Johnston, an amateur compared with Steven Spielberg.Secondly, despite what many critics have said, I felt that the dinosaurs in this movie were no where near as realistic as those used in the original two films. In fact, the person I was with leaned over and said to me quite plainly, 'They look fake'! The dinosaurs didn't look frightening and lacked any real menace/danger that was so evident in the first film.Thirdly, the film's emphasis on humour, such as the mobile phone scene, just pulled the whole movie franchise down a level. In my opinion, the Jurassic Park films worked much better with less lame, stupid humour, and with more subtle, witty comments, which were provided by Jeff Goldblum in the first two films.I have to admit, the plot in this film is weak, and the ending is completely bizarre, and just ends up making the film one complete huge joke. As one critic said, it makes the first two films look like examples of 'epic and classic filmaking'. Quite right so. For anyone interested in seeing this film, I warn you to STAY AWAY, and watch only the other two in the trilogy, as, quite frankly, this is an example of how a sequel should not be made.

It featured a stellar cast, good writing, groundbreaking special effects and an inspiring theme from John Williams. Which made it all the more surprising that the sequel &#150; The Lost World &#150; could be so poor. Mediocre acting, poor writing, irritating new characters and one of the most ridiculous plot twists in the history of cinema. However, even with all that, it is still far superior to this insipid instalment &#150; hopefully the last of the series.It is hard to pinpoint exactly where the problem lies. Rarely has a film combined such awful writing, acting and directing. The writing, however, stands out as the worst part of this film. It is astonishingly dull and monotonous &#150; there is an incredibly dull exchange of dialogue, then there are some noises, then everyone runs around for a while. Repeat for two hours. The scenes between Tea Leoni and William H. Macy are particularly insipid, with writing that would be more at place in a particularly bad daytime soap, and acting to match. It's possible to laugh at first, but it becomes very painful after a while. There comes a point where you just hope the dinosaurs are going to eat them all, but you know exactly who will survive from the very beginning. As for the dinosaurs setting traps and so forth &#150; it's almost on a par with a T-Rex wandering through suburbia without attracting any attention.The acting...pedestrian at best, just plain awful at every other time. Neil at least tries to give some effort, but when most of his scenes consist of grunting &#145;Run' (cue a lot of noise and running), there really isn't much he can do. At least Trevor Morgan isn't too awful for a screen kid, and the scene with the son of Laura Dern was pretty amusing. Speaking of which, was that really Dern? Either the makeup department has had a day off, or there was a really weird camera angle there.The direction, which was poor in the second film (from Spielberg, of all people), has certainly not improved. The long zoom-in for every 'dramatic' line (ie. 'run') may have its place in a TV show, but it is unacceptable for a major film. It's cheesy and simply looks bad. For examples, look at pretty much any shot of Sam Neil. Furthermore, there is very little to distinguish any of the assorted running scenes, so that they just become a dull, indistinguishable lump. Compare this to the very distinct scenes in the original film, and you can see just how far the series has fallen down.Perhaps the final scene sums up the problems of this film best &#150; an abrupt, meaningless end, with the usual insipid exchange between Leoni and Macy, and a hideous butchering of John Williams's beautiful original theme, which sounds as if it is being played at double speed.In all, it's dull, predictable and ultimately painful to watch. We can only hope that this is the last of the series, but, as this film demonstrates, the lure of money is often far too powerful. It certainly seems to be more important than producing a quality film.

Instead, what you get with Jurassic Park 3 is a pointless trick played on the unsuspecting movie goers (even though you should have seen it coming) by the greedy executives who wanted to milk the last drops of the Jurassic Park franchise. First of all, it's not even a Spielberg film anymore (he had the right idea not to get involved creatively), which would explain the lack of good imagery and a sense of adventure, as was apparent in the original Jurassic Park and even upheld quite a bit in The Lost World. But here we just get a pathetic hour and a half of senseless action with very little imagery. You would think that the advances in digital technology could make the visual effects better, but they somehow look less believable than the original, which suggests that very little attention was paid to the quality of the movie.And then there was the plot, or the lack of one. We all know that Jurassic Park is a big title for modern audiences, but there is a lot more to a movie than just selling the name. It almost seems as though the movie was bad on purpose, just because the producers knew that they could get away with it and still make money. That is how sad the film industry has become. Don't you as an audience member want something more than just a quick put together of random effects? Don't you want to be really entertained instead of just being fooled into it? I mean, why did it take three writers to write this story? What did they do, take turns writing a half hour each?Even the blockbuster films from just a few years before seem like quality movies now when compared to today's garbage. Movies like the original Jurassic Park and Independence Day can at least be remembered as difinitive blockbusters. But what we've had recently with Jurassic Park 3 and The Mummy Returns is just annoying garbage that no one will even remember by the end of this year.Then there are those who would argue that this is suppose to be a popcorn summer blockbuster and can stand behind the excuse of not having to be an actual quality movie. But let me tell you, in its respective genre, a summer blockbuster can still be a good summer blockbuster or a bad summer blockbuster. Just because it will undoubtedly make money doesn't mean that it can't be good. Wouldn't you rather have a good-entertaining movie as a opposed to a forgettable-entertaining movie? Or else we're all going to look back on this someday and say, Damn, I can't remember any movies that I liked that year. Because even if you liked Jurassic Park 3 now (which means that you are in dire need of a good film), I guarantee that you would choose not to sit through it again years from now.My solution to this headache, or my suggestion to those who disagree with me, is to go back and watch the original Jurassic Park. That is what a real action-adventure blockbuster should be. Made by a director with the capabilities of capturing daring images that will enhance the viewing experience, instead of assuming that the half-ass digital effects will do the job. Or better yet, see something like Star Wars or Indiana Jones again, and then you'll realize what an actual disgrace Jurassic Park 3 is to the blockbuster genre. Probably the only thing worse than this movie is knowing that it is part of a franchise that was once respectable and cool. But as far as I'm concerned, I will never consider Jurassic Park 3 as part of my Jurassic Park collection.

Needless to say, I loved it at the time. And even when I saw it again recently it worked for me. Jurassic Park may not be up there with Raiders of the Lost Ark or Aliens, it's still reasonably solid entertainment. I thought The Lost World was a complete dud. One of the reasons I wasn't really that interested in a third instalment of the series. When Spielberg hired Joe Johnston (I hated Jumanji) to fill the director's chair my interest almost much died completely. Almost, because I did decide to go see it.And for the umpteenth time this summer I was disappointed. The first twenty minutes are character exposition (read cardboard exposition) scenes. A lot has been made of the film's short running time. The strange thing is, it doesn't feel that short. Those first scenes are so badly written (I doubt if there's a single worthwhile line of dialogue throughout, actually) you'll think you've been sitting in the theatre for an entire hour. After that I thought the movie would pick up, but after five good minutes the pace dropped again and it becomes one of those tedious 'wait-for-the-action' type films. Worst of all is what the screenwriters have chosen to fill the action gaps with dull character interplay, rather unbelievable (and completely unnecessary) revelations about the raptors and even the introduction of the obligatory kid (a device which has been over- and misused after Aliens). On top of that there doesn't seem to be any effort on Johnston's part to keep the tension sustained between attacks.Now, you could just chalk a lot of the un-amazingness up to over-exposure to CG dinosaurs, with the BBC's Walking With Dinosaurs and Disney's Dinosaur (a project which really should have been made silent and by Paul Verhoeven) having been released since The Lost World. But that's not it. The set-pieces here play more like traditional action sequences without requiring the audience to go 'ooh' and 'aah' at the latest in virtual vermin (although there still are a couple of those shots slotted in). So lack of wonder isn't the problem. What is? Try rushed editing, shocks that don't shock and no suspense whatsoever. I can take bad dialogue, a downright stupid storyline and cardboard characters in a summer blockbuster, but I do expect the set-pieces to be either ultracool or nerve-wrecking. Here only two, maybe three scenes approach some form of excitement.And it's with two of these (a crash/ Spinosaurus attack and a dinosaur fight) that the movie, 20 minutes in, seems to be breaking stride. If only Joe Johnston managed to keep it up for the rest of the time. Any other points left to discus? Well, the ending sucks, I hate the way the climactic attack is intercut, you'll see who the victims and survivors are within seconds, the humour mostly misses the mark and at times the CG dinosaurs are below par. Then there's the acting; seldom was a cast this uncharismatic. You can actually read the dollar signs in Sam Neill's and William H. Macy's eyes (otherwise fine actors) and Tea Leoni is so terrible you'll want her to be eaten as soon as possible.In short An extremely formulaic, very badly written sequel. In fact, the short running time is the only thing that makes it reasonable watchable.

In retrospect, I cannot imagine why.  There is very little of this Jurassic Park that had not been tried in the previous two.  Sure, they tossed in a few new interesting dinosaurs.  They also used Sam Neil, an actor that often catches my interest.  Unfortunately, it seems that the dinosaurs have a better dialogue than the actors.  The first few scenes without the prehistoric actors are almost too painful to watch.  Even the visual effects have some weak points, which include the obvious use of blue screens and the silhouette of a helicopter in one of the other scenes.  The music is very similar to a few other films I have seen... Jurassic Park and JP The Lost World.  The plot is rather simple, people get stuck on the island and try to escape without being eaten, much like the first two.  At the end of the film, I was actually angry for having been duped into buying tickets and wasting my time.  My girlfriend was mad at me for dragging her to this movie.

Please!!  The raptors as portrayed in the first film possessed intelligence far beyond their cranial capacity, but I suspended my disbelief and simply enjoyed a fine piece of movie-making.  I failed to do that in Part III.  The silly plot of this film was a very flimsy excuse to get Sam Neill et al. back amongst the dinosaurs, which this time around were rather more unconvincing than they had been in the original Jurassic Park.  The Spinosaurus and the raptors were no longer animals - they were movie monsters.  And this film showed as much respect for realism as the majority of monster movies.  Spinosaurus, an animal about which scientists know very little, was given a fish-eater's skull but with bone-crushing T-rex-like teeth.  Worse than that, it lacked the spark of life that Spielberg's dinosaurs seemed to possess.  And that, I think was the crux of the problem - Spielberg's deft touch was absent.  Okay, so The Lost World was a pretty poor offering ... but it did have its moments, and compared to Part III it suddenly doesn't seem so bad.The saving grace of this film was, in my opinion, the pteranodons.  They were new and different, and unlike the Spinosaurus they were very convincing.  Their first appearance was genuinely scary, and for me was the highlight of the film.The cast was okay.  Sam Neill is always value for money, and William H Macy is, I am convinced, incapable of giving a bad performance.  But they all suffered from having to recite uninspired dialogue and do the very stupid things that the 'plot' demanded of them.  Apparently they threw out the original script at the start of the shoot and made it up (practically) as they went along.  It's hard to imagine how the original story could have been worse than the final product.Still, it was high energy entertainment, and at under 90 minutes did not outstay its welcome.

If folks were looking for some comic relief, he offered some; maybe no guffaws, but some warm-hearted moments. And okay, maybe the plotline was thin, but after the cloning aspect is played out in the first movie, what do you do? Get some people onto the island(s) and have them cavort with the dinosaurs, big and small, meat-eating and herbivores. There's not a lot you can do with the set-up to begin with.

Also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly enough dinosaurs.  And many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, just made cameos and didn't do much considering how cool they are.(START SPOILERS) Then there were the Pterodactyls.  The figures I've read put their body weight at about 15 pounds, while the movie made them look closer to 300.  Worse, they didn't get to eat anybody, or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up.  There was no ending to the movie, either, it was just, all of the sudden, credits.

The new dinosaur (Spinosaur) Looks good from a far but closed up, The Spinosaur looks really fake. The raptors are more of a joke than a threat, there is a scent with them that is too stupid to believe, and you end up laughing more than gasping.

Jurassic Park from 1993 was not a very good movie. It was very predictable and you could see in advance who was going to die and who was going to stay alive.In short it was a little boring,(and the book was even worse). And yet it wasn't a total disaster. There is at least one scene that became a classic which everyone copies ever since and it has some idea's which if they were more developed the film would be better. The Lost World Jurassic Park was a much more entertaining film, largely thanks to the decision to take the T-Rex to the big city. It was done in such a fun and I saw it as a parody to than upcoming Godzilla(and when Godzilla was finally out,it proved to be the worse of the 2 films).So now we reach our current film and there is no good words about it. It is simply a bad movie. I have a theory about JP3. Spielberg didn't want to make it. He didn't think he have anything new to say and he was busy with 2 other,more important, projects(A.I. and Minority Report). Universal studios wanted a third sequel so eventually Spielberg agreed making the film but retain the title of executive producer(which meant that he get some percentage of the profits, but has nothing to say on the film).To show you how bad the film is, here some guiding points for watching it1. If a child disappears in the first act of the film he will show up later on the film, managing, miraculously, to survive a place where adults are having hard time to survive.2.If the parents of the child are divorced, by the end of the film, they will get back together. The father will prove himself to be worthy of the woman love and admiration. (This is suppose to be and action movie and we get a film which reinforce the value of the American family.Yack!!!).3. If one of the good guys do something bad, that he shouldn't have done he will redeem himself and will get the chance to be only badly wounded instead of getting killed.Beside the written above, the film is a re-hearse of idea's from the first 2 movies. The idea that the dinosaurs are intelligent creatures was use in the first film. The idea that they are very paternal was use in the second one. The second idea is put against the human angel. The dinosaurs are portrait as more caring for their offspring(even the unborn), than the human ones.Joe Johnston, the director, can't handle an action film. He has made all the wrong decisions in directing the film(and it should be mentioned here that Jumanji,one of his previous work,suffered from the same problems)and it looked like he tried to copy someone else instead of trying to be original. The ending of the film, beside been a re-shot of the first film, show a lack of judgment from all people involved. If the flying dinosaurs(and I can't pronounce their name) are so dangerous why even let them leave the island? Only the screenwriters and the producers know.The only 2 good things in the movie, which helped the movie get a 3 out of 10 from me instead the 1 out of 10 it deserved, were the special effects, which should not be surprise and Sam Neill whose dry tone was on the verge of been cynic. A tone which said Yes, I've been there and yes it's a repeat, but I get so much money so why the hell not to do it.In short. This is film to be avoided. It is waste time and a waste of money. Both should be spent somewhere else.

Kitchen. To date Jurassic Park remains my favourite movie of all time, no questions asked. The sequel? Flawed, yet brilliant, replacing the serious, moody Sam Neil with Jeff Goldblums' goofy, pessimistic Ian Malcolm and introducing INGEN as more of a relentlessly capitalistic corporation than just John Hammond and his smug-yet-blundering team of scientists meant that The Lost World was far enough removed from the original to lean more towards the action genre than the sci-fi/horror that came before, successfully expanding on a fantastic idea. Now, at some point I'm going to have to mention the film in question, as much as it pains me, so here goes.It's laughable. By now the entire planet knows about the Park, yet no government organisation has made any attempts to do anything about, no INGENesque investors have attempted to profit from the islands, the world has conveniently forgotten all about it (conveniently allowing the standard foolish tourists that such second-rate, they're-coming-to-get- you films need, access to a large collection of assorted predators). While a film about a theme park full of genetically engineered dinosaurs is not exactly what you'd call realistic, the idea that the world would do nothing about it is not ridiculous, it's just bloody stupid.So where next? Well, we've done a T-rex, a spitty-thing and 3 Raptors (JP1) We've done 2 T-rexes, a baby T-rex, a pack of Raptors in the long grass and these weird, tiny little dinosaurs who you could blatantly smash to pieces with a small stick, yet still manage to eat the bad guy from The Big Lebowski (JP2)... Oh! I know we'll bring in this BIG dude to ruin the t-rex's party, introduce the Pterosaur cage from the first book, and lets give the raptors their own language -therefore enhancing their level of evil- make them smaller and give them a few feathers!! Even though they're allegedly the same as the animals in JP2. And Dr. Grant also mentions in the movie how the Spinosaurus was not on InGen's list of dinosaurs, it was a top secret experiment that was hidden from the public (convenient!).So as we have established, this is a film built on a relic of an amazing idea for a film, it hurts me personally to know that because of it two of my favourite films will never join the great trilogies of my generation, and if the rant above doesn't dissuade you from wasting your time on this lurching Frankenstein, then maybe this will; It is an admirable goal and a daunting task to try and emulate the work of a great director like Spielberg, and in no way does any aspect of this film match up to what has gone before it, but not only that, it also makes no attempts to expand any more than JP2 already did, it lacks creativity, the acting is poor -the return of Sam Neil does nothing to draw the viewer away from the awfully-stereotypical drone of the hired guns there to supply a bit of fodder for the dinos- and the climax of the film is -quite frankly- a bit of an anticlimax. All in all I would rather this film be scrubbed from the annals of history and the whisper of its very name made punishable by death. The worst part? They're bringing out another one.

A tragic accident maroons the party of seven, and they must attempt to escape with their lives. Third Times The Charm! No, no it's not. Here we are given the third installment in the Jurassic series directed by Joe Johnston, who brought us Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, The Rocketeer, Jumanji, The Pagemaster and many other pretty good ones but this one right is where something went in a complete different direction. Shorter runtime than any other of the Jurassic park films, we are still handled a outrageous Dinosaurs but this time with no eagerness. The only robust thing I found redeeming in this film is seeing Sam Neil reprise his role as Alan Grant, he's mostly the only sturdy thing that held this film together. Other characters in this I found obnoxious are the roles played by William H. Macy & Téa Leoni, two greats talents that are given such irksome characters that give off vibes for you to start perceiving for throughout, they just manipulated Alan and we need to start being sympathetic towards them? No thank you. If you were expecting enticing dinosaur fun, you expected.......wrong, there is a fight between a T-Rex and a Spinosaurus that lasts about 20, 25 seconds which altogether is really discouraging and a complete misspend. The dinosaurs aren't even amusing in this, the writers made them really treacherous and solemn and instead of the magnificent use of animatronics in the past, we are given fully functioned CGI dinosaurs that are so evidently that it's not even funny. When those end credits pop up on the screen, you distinguish that you have just sat through a hour and a half of full disappointment. There is so much silliness as well that do not make any actual sense but can make just chuckle a little bit, I won't go deep into detail but just trust me on this. Overall, Jurassic Parks III exceeds to point from unlikable characters to where a lot doesn't seem to make sense. Sam Neil was only reason why I stuck all the way through and he surely was the only character I enjoyed!

The threadbare plot involves an irritating divorced couple played by a very annoying Téa Leoni and William H Macy looking for their son who is lost on the island. They convinced Sam Neill's character to help, yet end up basically kidnapping the man, because he's the last thread connecting this stinker to the first Jurassic film - not that he's really the best man for the job. Leoni's character is nails on the chalkboard horrible and Jurassic Park III is basically just a bunch of dino chases and attacks stitched together by a script that was made up as they went along. At least it's mercifully short. A dream scene involving a velociraptor saying Alan is the stuff of bad movie gold, unfortunately that's about 5 seconds long and the rest of the film is just obnoxious.

Jurassic Park and The Lost World excelled at the premise of dinosaurs on an island and then along comes Jurassic Park III to cause the film, let alone the entire franchise, to go down the drain. Within this film are fatal mistakes that destroys the movie as a whole.The film is just a dinosaur attack film. Yes, The Lost World is like that too, but Jurassic Park III can not even do what its predecessor did to make it work on some note. The Lost World had the herbivores also be dangerous. Jurassic Park III made it so the carnivores are dangerous and the herbivores are friendly to humans. With that in place, the humans go running through herds of dinosaurs that are actually just as dangerous as the raptors that are chasing them. To add to the annoyance of the dinosaur attack film, the first thing that happens when the group settles down is that plane is attacked and two people are eaten by the Spinosaurus.Nothing new is added to the film. The entire reason there is a film is because someone got stuck on the island and the group goes to rescue them. If I recall correctly, that is the same reason there was a plot in The Lost World. Even minor moments are stolen from the other films like Billy has a lucky bag, same as Sarah. The plane crashes because of the main dinosaur, the trailers are destroyed by the main dinosaur. And so on. Actually, the nothing new thing is a lie. They had new dinosaurs and new dinosaurs attack. They redid the raptors, replaced the T-Rex with the Spinosaurus, and added Pteranodons as another dinosaur to attack. The writers spent little time working on an original story that was not done in the previous movie and instead spent time adding and changing the dinosaurs.The film is poorly written, complete with comical and one dimensional characters, dinosaurs that bring nothing interesting, and has no tension because there are no twists on who will make it or what the dinosaurs or the characters are going to do. All in all, Jurassic Park III is the worst film of the Jurassic Park franchise and a bad movie altogether.

And before it's over, he'll know a lot more, but at a price he'd rather exchange for ignorance than pay if he had it to do over again.	As far as Grant is concerned, Jurassic Park is history and something he'd just as soon forget.  And he definitely had no intention of ever going near one of those islands again, but just as the funding for his archeologic dig is about to dry up, a man named Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) shows up with deep pockets and a willing checkbook.  It seems that Kirby and his wife, Amanda (Tea Leoni) are adventure seekers, and for their wedding anniversary they've received permission from the Costa Rican government for a low fly-by over Isla Sorna, where the products of InGen are still thriving and roaming about freely.  They want Grant along as a kind of tour guide, and though his instincts tell him not to do it, he reluctantly agrees for the sake of his dig.  And after all, it's just a simple fly-by and they won't really be getting close to the island at all.  But we all know better than that, don't we?  Soon Grant and the Kirbys, along with their pilot and two other gentlemen, are winging their way toward the land that Grant wishes Time would've forgot.	The plot is fairly simple and straightforward, the cast is great, the special effects are outstanding, and Johnston keeps it all on track and moving right along.  Most importantly, it's fun and exciting, with just enough tension to keep you going until the end.  It's a far cry from the original `Jurassic Park,' but that is to be expected; there's no way to recapture that special sense of wonder evoked by that very first glimpse of the island and those dinosaurs, and that's what really separates the original from the sequels.  You can only discover something once, and after that it becomes a matter of simply pursuing more of the same.  But it's kind of like discovering chocolate cake; that first time is great, even something special, but it doesn't mean you don't enjoy it just as much the next time around, especially if it's good cake.	Malcom is sorely missed in this one, but it's good to see Dr. Grant back, and Sam Neill slips comfortably back into the role as if he never left, picking right up where he left off without missing a beat.  And Macy can always be counted upon to deliver a solid performance, no matter what role he's playing; he's simply one of the best character actors in the business, and he does an excellent job of bringing Kirby to life here.  Tea Leoni is also a welcome addition to the `JP' family, and though this part is hardly a stretch for her as an actor, she makes her character believable, and she and Macy work very well together.	The supporting cast includes Michael Jeter (Udesky), Alessandro Nivola (Billy), Trevor Morgan (Eric), John Diehl (Cooper), Bruce A. Young (Nash) and Laura Dern (Dr. Ellie Sattler).  This isn't a film that purports to be insightful or anything more than what it is, which is good, solid entertainment.  But like space shuttles and Moon walks, `Jurassic Park III' is a big movie that is bound to be taken for granted to a certain extent, which is kind of a shame.  Because from Steven Spielberg, who started it all, right on down through all the rest of the cast, crew, technicians (or perhaps we should call them `magicians') and all of the rest who contributed to the monumental task of bringing this film to the screen, they did a flawless job and made it look easy.  This may be pure entertainment, but it's also art in it's purest form, and the filmmakers responsible should be acknowledged for their achievement.  Contrary to what many may think, those dinosaurs didn't put themselves up there on the screen.  And a film like this is nothing less than a tribute to talent, dedication and craftsmanship-- and without a doubt, it's what the magic of the movies is really all about.  I rate this one 8/10.

Just because Steven Spielberg directed the previous two Jurassic Park adventures, this one being directed by Joe Johnston (October Sky 1999, Jumanji 1995, The Rocketeer 1991) raises the curiosity of how good/fun it can be. Under the 'simply wanted to see it' motivation, I found suspense, thrills, drama and action for teenagers, parents, faithful Jurassic Park followers (Sam Neill's back, and Laura Dern briefly appears), and just about for everyone who wants to be entertained and enjoys survival storylines. (We are reminded that Sam was not in The Lost World JP2.)Welcome to Isla Sorna - JP3. It is one continuous adventurous ride, with no overlong drawn out action sequences. There are plenty of cliffhangers to keep your adrenaline going for an hour and 33 mins. Subliminally it felt longer - it was well edited, with not a moment wasted, providing just the right amount of 'breathing' segments along the way to let you pick up little details/clues in following the story. You may say it's a tidy script there's not a line of dialog that was trivial. There are reasons why each key character is there and why something's said, and amidst all the adventurous urgencies with the effective menacing Stan Winston's dino-creatures, you'll click and realize it was no passing remark that was uttered earlier by Tea Leoni as Mom, William H. Macy as Dad, Trevor Morgan as Eric the son, or Alessandro Nivola's Billy, assistant to Sam Neill's Dr. Grant. Even the brief scene of the little boy (as the son of Laura Dern) pausing in front of a TV screen provided a 'close encounter' suspenseful moment. Hm.There are fleeting reminders of Hitchcock's The Birds, jungle aura of Tarzan flicks, a rescue moment from Gold Diggers The Secret of Bear Mountain, and Rob Cohen's Dragonheart. The camera's everywhere right on the water surface, high up in the air, close-up on faces, down amidst the jungle and trees, bringing us to previous Jurassic Park locales, going underwater, struggling along on a half-capsized boat during an eventful downpour&#133; The indispensable sound effects, and additional new music by Don Davis (along with reprise of John William's original JP theme) rounded off the excitement from this Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment adventure fare.

I was left wanting more, and this movie deserves a special edition with extra footage, but that is probably better than wanting less. The film also scores points for parodying movies of this type, and is a shameless example of cinema as amusement park ride in its purest form, although the finale chickens out in the end.

I started with this point to demonstrate the diversity on which one between 2 and 3 are the worst ones. Do you like something trying something, aiming high and failing or something that aims lower and on it's merits fails. In all honesty though, I think I prefer this one while the second one just padded itself out, trying to be the grand epic story that the first one was while this?... It's a bit better.The plot is that Alan Grant is still studying Dinosaurs and is approached by a wealthy man to go into the island from the second movie to just sight see with his wife. Grant refuses but then accepts thanks to his money. On the island they find out that he isn't rich and the reason why they're doing this is to find their lost son who was on a boat ride dumb enough to go into a quarantined zone, thanks to the last movie.The biggest weakness with this movie is that while it does try to be more like a B-Movie I don't think it takes that many advantages with it, I mean it's Jurassic Park - It's not like people won't flock to it. It just kind of sits there when I can name hundreds of other B-Movies that manage to be more entertaining and memorable with less then a quarter of this movie's budget.With the fun out of it that just leads to me seeing too many plot holes in the movie, even more then the last one. My favourite bad part of this movie is at the end where on the helicopter they see Pterodactyls flying in the distance and Grant says they're looking for new nesting grounds while the whimsical music plays... That's not whimsical, that's terrifying and how did they get out of the bird cage anyway? It's just stuff like noticing that that really detracts from the enjoyment of what is essentially a turn off your brain experience.Although the rest is actually pretty good. I mean sure the effects aren't that good, the characters are bland and there is almost no reason for this to be made at all, but this is meant to be played up like a B-Movie. It doesn't succeed at that but it isn't trying to be grand and epic like The Lost World.The problem at the end of the day is that somehow it tries to get away from being as fun as it could have been. It just sits there in some kind of mediocrity trying to either be a B-Movie and take itself seriously while never achieving either. The best thing I can say is that it is much better then the second one, but so far - the first one is still my favourite.

This time, the people stumble across Site B (from the second movie), finding it a derelict place overrun by prehistoric wildlife, including bigger, badder, and smarter creatures.There are a few good thrills to be had with Jurassic Park III. At this point, the special effects have been refined to look sharper and move smoother, and there are still some huge animatronics being employed. Thus, you get a lot of good-looking dinosaurs running loose chasing people all over the island. This includes the epic Spinosaurous, which makes its introduction by fighting and defeating a T-Rex in mortal combat. There are also raptors everywhere, which use more cunning than before to hunt down their prey. On top of that, there's also some Pteranodons in a giant bird cage (from a scene that was in the original novel but never used before). The dinosaur action is modestly satisfying and pretty fun.Unfortunately, the story leaves much to be desired. It is great to see Dr. Grant returning as the protagonist (and Dr. Sattler in a smaller role), but he winds up being surrounded by a bunch of the dumbest dorks imaginable. The whole plot revolves around an estranged and dippy couple that lost their son; they go so far as tricking and manipulating Grant and his protégé to the island. Once they all finally get there, it's just one dumb move after another, followed by lots of running and screaming. The film becomes a bit more endearing with the chase scenes, and the characters' human sides become apparent, but there are still some dumb things that happen that ruin all creditability (including watching a smartphone travel through a dinosaur's digestive system and somehow work underwater to relay an unintelligible message that somehow prompts the military to show up in the end...yeah right). Of all the faults with this film, however, the one thing that's always bothered me the most is that there's nothing new involved; it's just another island adventure with little connection to previous events, and nowhere else to go. The movie doesn't advance the arc of the series at all (though I haven't seen Jurassic World just yet, I have a feeling you can skip this one no problem), so it comes off as a mere throwaway adventure.This film has good-looking photography, including some decent POV shots. Editing is solid. Sam Neill is as fun to watch as ever. Laura Dern is barely in the movie; what little screen time she has is fine and dandy. William H. Macey and Téa Leoni are excellent at playing the dippiest characters imaginable; Trevor Morgan does a fine job in his role; all the mercenary characters are fun to watch, and everybody else is just peachy. Writing is pretty weak, and there's hardly any dialogue that stands out. This production uses decent-looking sets, props, costumes, locales, and special effects. Music rehashes all the old themes.This film has its share of cool action, and it often tries to recapture the same sense of wonder and whimsey that made the first film endearing. However, the plot doesn't hold much water, the characters are frustrating, and the whole movie doesn't leave as much of a lasting impact as the last two.3/5 (Experience Average | Story Marginal | Film Pretty Good) "},{"Title":"Return to the island","Date":"11 June 2015","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" History is crazy when you look back on things, in 2001 I remember being so pumped for another film in the Jurassic Park series I saw this one in theaters with my brother. The film had me on the edge of my seat during the scenes with the DinosaursBut looking back on it the film did hurt the series that we know and love. For one thing it is directed by Joe Johnson. He just didn't seem to fit the role of director. That's like replacing your best Quarterback for a second string QB just won't work. Plus the film took out the beloved Tyrannosaurus Rex with in seconds just to bring in a new dinosaur Spinosaurus? I mean all Jurassic Park fans know that The T-Rex is the flagship Dinosaur along with the Raptors and you can't have a film like this without the other.There is just so many wrongs it's hard to pick up the rights in this film but I will share my thoughts on the good.The plot of the film is center around Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) along with his partner on the dig site he was working on Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) were ask to their guide as they fly over Isla Sorna Site B with Paul Kirby (William H Macy) and his wife Amanda Kirby (Téa Leoni) however things are not what they appear to be as they also accomplish by three mercenaries Mr.Udesky (Michael Jeter) Cooper (John Diehl) and M.B.Nash (Bruce A.Young). The Kirbys have a real hidden agenda their real intentions was to have Dr.Grant help them find their son Eric (Trevor Morgan) who was lost on the island due to a accident. However two of the mercenaries are killed by the Spinosaurus as their only way of escaping their plane crashed as then destroyed by the Spinosaurus.To make matters worse they are also chase by Velociraptors. So pretty much most of the film is spend with the characters being chased and running away from the Dinosaurs like a game of cat and mouseWhat's another knock on the film is that the relationship between Dr.Grant and Dr.Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is no longer the same as it was in the first film that really show case one of the red flags for the film, I mean I would have love to see Ellie and Alan still together but no they just ruin that relationship for us.Another bone I have to pick about this film is that the effects for the Dinosaurs are just a let down the first two were far superior while there are a few effects for the Dinosaurs like the Pteranodon scene that has good effects. Also the film is only 90 minutes long making it the shortest film of the Jurassic Park movies which is another knock on the film.The good I like is that Sam's performance shows how he was meant to play Dr.Alan Grant only he could be that character no one else. Laura returning as Ellie was better than nothing. Also there are some tense movements in the film like I love the scene the Raptor was pretending to be inside the glass tube when he really was behind it I love how well that was build so that is one plus I can give for the film.Also the setting of the island looks more swamp. The music once again matches the story of the film as you can always count on Jurassic Park to make some of the best music in a motion pictureThe plot was interesting despite some knocks, Just wish Alan and Ellie were still together that is one thing that could have made the film better. Overall I will consider Jurassic Park 3 a mix bag I'm giving the rating I give because I love Jurassic Park it just this film could have been better if it wasn't being rush I give Jurassic Park 3 an 7 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Bad, But Not as Terrible as I Thought It Would Be","Date":"11 June 2015","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" The aspect of Jurassic Park III that I liked is the fact that Dr. Alan Grant is restored as the protagonist in this installment, making for a more intriguing focus than when Goldblum was the protagonist of The Lost World.

I set my expectations super low for a film I vaguely remember seeing around the time it was released, which means I haven't seen the film in roughly 14 years.Just like in The Lost World, I can't believe how idiotic some of the characters were in this film. In The Lost World it was the old man who was extremely dumb sending people into danger again after being responsible for the tragedy at Jurassic Park, and now Kirby is the idiot for tricking Dr. Grant and his sidekick Billy into helping him rescue his son on the second island on which InGen was creating dinosaurs. It is brave of him as a father, but all the arrangements he made were stupid - Dr. Grant is a dinosaur expert, not the head of a rescue squad, the mercenaries Kirby hired weren't really mercenaries, and of course everybody except Grant, Kirby and his family, and Billy, are killed.What doesn't make too much sense is that Kirby couldn't convince the U.S. embassy to help rescue his son, yet Ellie (Laura Dern) is able to convince the navy and marines to rescue Grant and everyone still alive on the island after one phone call from Grant.This movie reminds me of a shorter version of Saving Private Ryan in a way, but these people are risking their lives for one boy, not one soldier, which creates a different emotional connection than Saving Private Ryan.The quality of the film just doesn't seem to match up to the original 2 - the CGI is overused in this one and looks worse than the CGI of the first 2, and the robotic dinosaurs are utilized less, which kind of breaks the illusion of the movie. The writing is bad (by the way, what was Alexander Payne doing co-writing this movie? that was a strange credit to see) with dialogue about driving 5 miles under the speed limit intending to be meaningful (I'm not joking, it's that bad) and we lack dialogue as well as the theme of the ethics of recreating dinosaurs overall except for one instance when Grant says this is playing God, referring to what InGen was doing.The movie held my interest at times, but it was a fairly bad 3rd installment for this movie franchise.

JURASSIC PARK III takes those decades of learning - and gives us Running and Screaming a lot.Totally lost the plot; the corporations and marketers and unevolved apes who call themselves filmmakers have forgotten what made dinosaurs such a wonder in the first place. It wasn't Running and Screaming From Them. The majesty, the mystery, the alienness of dinosaurs to current fauna; the thought-provoking concept that all the dinosaurs we know of are actually more successful as a species than Man, having thrived for millions of years (while homo sapiens has been in recognizable form only 100,000 - some say even less after viewing Rob Schneider movies); the fact that at their reign, certain dinosaur species were the largest animals on Earth; the foods they ate, their herd habits; the fact they were NOT REPTILES but a sub-Group of Archosaurs; the fact they are more closely related to birds than reptiles or mammals - all these things make dinosaurs intriguing and wondrous.But JURASSIC PARK III has Running and Screaming.Sam Neill is once again Dr. Alan Grant (remember him? From JURASSIC PARK, 1993, sensibly sidestepping THE LOST WORLD, then insensibly stepping in it with this one) is tricked onto that OTHER island with the dinosaurs - Isla Sorna? Isla Nublar? - who cares? When does the Running and Screaming Express leave? Only two subplots are worth mentioning in this film - that of the velociraptors' communicative abilities (through noises made via an air chamber in their skulls); and the heartbreaking fallout between Grant and his student sidekick (young, muscular, blonde Allesandro Nivola, one-upping Jeff Goldblum as The Sexyboy).All the rest is Running and Screaming.William H.

The feature saurian (meaning the One That Does The Most Chasing of the Running and Screaming People) is a Spinosaurus, bigger than a t-rex, with a sail like Dimetrodon (even more believable than those glued-on sails on 1950s iguanas) and with hands that actually work. Early on, we are treated to the Ali-Frasier of Dinosaur ringside - the Spino versus the Tyranno. There can be only one. Because the effects department complained.For effects adrenalin, for believability of the dinosaurs, this movie is unbeatable. That's why it still scores in high mediocre. I don't mind seeing all the dinosaurs - it's what the movie turns them into that vexes me. I'm terribly vexed. They are simply Things To Run From. The few seconds of wonder come in barely noticeable snatches (where John Williams's majestic theme would try and manipulate us into sharing the moment).When I was a kid watching all those stop-motion movies (JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS, VALLEY OF GWANGI) and those stinkers with iguanas with glued-on sails (KING DINOSAUR, THE LOST WORLD 1960), I was always aching to snatch a glimpse of something prehistoric - invariably there would never be enough prehistoric stuff (and the cave women never slipped nipple out of their furs). And when we did see the feature creatures, it was disappointing at best, as they were on a rear projection or interacting very suspiciously unrealistically with the actors.So I'm envious of kids today who get served up movies like JP III; kids who are here for the same reason I was there back then - for the Running and Screaming! And see lots of prehistoric creatures in grand interaction with people.But back to the subplots When Grant finds out that the entirely-likable Billy has stolen some raptor eggs (for the best research intentions and funding), he belittles him so thoroughly that we feel Billy's humiliation like a hot flush. And we understand why Billy would later sacrifice himself. We wish we could see Grant retract his scathing derogation, but we don't.The science of dinosaur communication, appearance and habits has grown exponentially concurrently with the JURASSIC PARK films. Subsequently, the velociraptors in the films have evolved from from being dull brown to sporting rudimentary feathers and various colors; in JURASSIC PARK they simply roared, now in JP III, they're honking and yipping all over the place like chicks at a slumber party - intelligence greater than primates.  I say, old chap, that's all dashed interesting - but - shouldn't the original DNA have brought out those characteristics in the very first cloned dinosaurs (in JURASSIC PARK)? Just because WE'VE discovered it only now doesn't mean that they weren't always like that - their DNA should have reflected that! Yes, fans, I have indisputably proved that JURASSIC PARK is Only A Movie! I forgot to mention the Running and Screaming.Last scene shows pteranodons flying out over the ocean, the kid asking, Where do you think they're going? To JURASSIC PARK IV, of course.

But unlike the second one, I actually consider Jurassic Park III a descent movie. Flawed yes, but it isn't really bad.The main problem is that it's just completely pointless. This was the only Jurassic Park Novel not based on a book, so was there any point in adabting it. It's also a little too kid friendly, almost like it was dumbed down a bit for a wider audience even though it's PG-13. Some of the CGI didn't age well at all, and Joe Johnson's direction isn't nearly as good as Steven Spielbergs. Pretty much every other problem is nitpicking.Now the fact that this isn't based on a book actually makes this better than The Lost World. That film didn't have anything to do with the book it was based on except for the basic plot of going to another island of dinosaurs. This film actually has a few elements from the second book that weren't in the last movie. The action scenes are pretty entertaining. I like the characters. Sam Niell is a better lead than Malcolm. It's just a short fun movie.Jurassic Park III is flawed, definitely. It isn't nearly as good as the first one, but I found it to be an enjoyable flick.

Sadly the Lost World diminished the respect of the first through conventional action sequences and atrocious array of protagonists and when this third number was scheduled for release in 2001 the word cash cow may have been uttered, and whilst this is true, there is redemption.The opening sequence sees a man and a young lad paragliding near to Isla Sorna and after a bizarre fog shot they must let go of their rope and are soon flying into the island. From there the plot brings back a few familiar faces in Sam Neill's excellent Alan Grant and some new protagonists which are quite flimsy. William H Macy is the unlikely hero, Alessandro Nivola is the aspiring learner whilst Tea Leoni is cringe worthy as an exasperated mother.Thankfully the different personalities match up in a blissfully tantalizing plot that introduces us to a Spinosaurus, pterodactyls and less compys. The problem with the second film was in fact the dinosaurs, too much action and trying to capitalise on the established usage of the first. Jurassic Park was brilliant because of their minimal screen time, less was most certainly more and that principal is close to being matched here.Perhaps the Spinosaurus is used too frequently but bar that the extensive plotting of the other action montages are great. The raptor trap was brilliantly staged and I challenge anyone to admit they weren't a little scared when we saw the raptor in the centre.Jumanji director Joe Johnston manages to effectively generate adrenaline through such well used shots during the dinosaur attacks but the tension is further mounted through the anticipation. He is very aware of the characters on the island and makes them isolated and with such dark lighting and negative protagonists this generates a fast moving plot that justifies its specified genre.The score has improved since the last film as has the dialogue and scripting in general. There is no terrible humour more sweet jibes at others whilst the romantic intention between Macy and Leoni is initially corny this fades into desperation to find their lost son.This is a fully packed adrenaline rush that is easy to watch and redeems the failure of the previous release and is a fine way to round off the series. Talks of a fourth release are still just talks and since author Michael Crichton passed away in late 2008 it is arguably best to leave the work on a high which captured his marvellous concept and generated some great big blockbusters that can be watched over and over again.

The film was hardly a masterpiece (the story and some of the characters were fairly unrealistic, many easy-to-notice and major bloopers), but the films finer points over powered the weaknesses.Jurassic Park was basically a special effects demonstration, but a well crafted one. With that said, Jurassic Park III has more in common with its predecessor than many would give it credit for. However, JP III lacks the fore mentioned finer points that made the original work. The acting is flat, quite flat. Even Jurassic Park veteran Sam Neil, who gave a solid performance as the charter Alan Grant in the first film, is stiff in his acting this time around. The other issue is the film's pace. Jurassic Park had suspenseful timing. It would build up tension and then release it at well chosen moments. Jurassic Park III tries to just throw dinosaur themed action at you as fast as it can, without effectively building up the moment. As for the story, well it is actually pretty lame. It is a sad excuse for a sequel plot.The cinematography in Jurassic Park III isn't poorly done, but it can't compare to the cleverness of Jurassic Park's constantly iconic and dramatically chosen points of view. Not all in this movie is bad. The dinosaurs themselves don't disappoint. If anyone in Jurassic Park III should be nominated for best actor, it should be one of its CGI or animatronic cast members who are actually more convincing than the flesh and blood human cast. There are moments when it is a real challenge to tell apart the late Stan Winston's practical dinosaurs from Industrail Light and Magic's CGI ones. It is a pure delight to watch the roaring, hissing, winged, and clawed creatures interact with the scenery, fight, and destroy on the screen. If only they could tear apart the lame story and dull characters in the process...

But, if you liked it the first two times you may well like it again. I will admit the scenery was better this time, the terrain covered much more exciting. And after watching the horrible CGI in Snakes on a Plane, it is nice to see a film made by people who could make convincing digital creatures over ten years ago. Still not as good as the original dinosaurs, but the budget and a tighter schedule are likely to blame for that. Why are these people not working on all the other really bad films?I guess Jeff Goldblum had to pull out of this film because of a leg injury. That makes me sad, because Ian Malcolm is by far the best character in the series. Instead, there is a brief exchange between Sam Neill and a kid about Malcolm's books being preachy. For shame. Preachy or not, Malcolm was the only one who really knew what was going on.This film gave me exactly what I expected dinosaurs.

One way to change the focus a bit would be to hire a new director for a new creative outlook on the project, as was done by Spielberg-appointed Joe Johnston. The poor man must have had an enormous amount of pressure on him to not destroy the world Spielberg had so masterfully created in the first two films in the series. Johnston indeed doesn't tank the series here, but he is certainly no Steven Spielberg, and so the overall quality of the film falls, as would be expected. Johnston seems adept at picking up where Spielberg left off, and it is clear that effort is being shown to continually push the envelope in terms of special effects and constant thrills and tension. Indeed, not a minute has passed since the humans landing on it before they are already attacked and people start to die. This is one of the main flaws in Jurassic Park 3 - it continues the non-stop thrills theme the first two demonstrated, but seems a bit more blatant in doing so. The incessant action, while enjoyable seems a bit too unrealistic and staged to be entirely enjoyable. Even the huge action setpiece of T-Rex versus new enormous predatorial dinosaur Spinosaurus, which exhilarating and highly enjoyable seems ridiculously gratuitous, which subtracts from the fun somewhat. And I find it hard to understand how with such excellent dinosaur special effects, a destroyed plane after a crash can look so much like cardboard...All in all, it seems like all the best moments in Jurassic Park 3 are ones that we've already seen countless times before. It's still all fun, but not executed nearly as well as in the Spielberg films, so one feels as if one might as well be watching one of the earlier movies. The sequence in the tyrannodon bird-cage is the exception - thrilling, breathless, tense and wonderfully executed, it is easily the high point of the movie. However, there are still decent performances present in Jurassic Park 3 Sam Niel gives the film his all, reprising his gruff palaeontologist character Alan Grant from the first film, he is easily the highlight of this one. William H. Macy and Téa Léoni are believable as parents, frantic to find their lost son, and have excellent chemistry with each other, though both come off as annoying quite often during the movie, and it is of course nice to see a tiny appearance from Laura Dern, also reprising her character from the first Jurassic Park movie. She and Sam Niel still show superb chemistry, and it's a shame her part wasn't larger in this movie. So all in all, Jurassic Park 3 is an entertaining enough movie, but still falls short of echoing the quality of the first two films. All the best moments are ones we've already seen many times before in the earlier two movies, in which they were executed better. Still, JP3 seems a valiant attempt by all concerned, if fraught with too many cheesy moments and unbelievable situations to be entirely credible. Still an entertaining way to pas the time, but when in doubt, see either of the first two - they are much stronger and more entertaining films, and in the end, JP3 just seems like a weaker relapse of them.-6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Spoiled ROTTEN!","Date":"6 August 2005","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":" Just watched this movie again for the umpteenth time, as I get psyched up for Peter Jackson's KING KONG this December.

In JPII I get to do that as often as I like. And I like. I like to pretend now and then, even at the tender age of 55.

For such a short movie (92 minutes) it sure took a long time before the film moved to the island.  I had heard that it was short and thought that the film should not take too long to get to the island, but it did.  Running time is the second worst thing in this movie.

The filmmakers seem to believe that a bigger dinosaur with sharper teeth will bring new thrills to the audience, but there are very few thrills at all.  Flying Pteranodons attack the group in countless scenes of near death escapes.  There  is no character development, except for Macy and Leoni, who somehow find time to reconcile their dysfunctional marriage on the romantic Jurassic island (yes that is sarcasm).  The climax is so unbelievably ridiculous, that you will roll your eyes.  All I have to say is that no cell phone would work after traveling through the stomach acids of a dinosaur and coming out the other end.

The third volume of the dinosaur thriller really is quite disappointing. Even though I wasn't expecting much out of it, as I've heard the second and third movies are usually really bad compared to their predecessor, I still came out saying, That doesn't deserve to be a movie.One factor which I think played a part for why I didn't like it as much as the first two was the switch in direction. Steven Spielburg gave the reins to his production cohort, Joe Johnston. Now, while Johnston did a fairly good job for someone who was taking over a large movie franchise empire, there was too much riding on this movie that even Spielburg could fix to make perfect. But, I think the final outcome would have been considerably better than Johnston's version. No offense to Joe Johnston.Another fact was the lack of plot. Not only was there no creative genius theory as there was in the first one, this movie had no real plot. Unless you call two divorced people looking for their son on Isla Sorna and getting involved with dinosaurs a plot. The movie was just non-stop action. Which is ok if you like that kind of stuff. But for me, I need a method behind the madness type of influence. I can't just see lots of running around, lots of dinosaur chases, and lots of worried faces and expect to walk out of the theater with a satisfied grin. Perfect example The Matrix. There is a lot of heavy metal warfare, lots of chase scenes and action, but the movie really has great theoretical support from Andy and Larry (Wachowski), who came up with the mind behind it. I think they could have expanded upon the fact that the dinosaurs can talk to each other, thus drawing out the creative genius portion of the movie.I was very disappointed with this movie. Minimal action, practically no deaths, and a thin plot line. Hopefully Jurassic Park IV will be better. <rolleyes> "},{"Title":"Just barely worth watching...but only once ***spoiler warning***","Date":"23 July 2001","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  ***spoiler warning***This film, though ridiculous, manages to be entertaining.  The trick is to check your brain at the door and not expect anything but to be entertained. The film just barely manages to do this, so it might be worth your time.Having said that, I still feel compelled to spew my thoughts about this movie and what bothered me about it...Will there never be a good CGI dinosaur movie?  The 1st JP was solid and stands the test of time.  And the characters aren't nearly as annoying as in its sequels; in some respects, they're even likeable. Still, it's not particularly great.  JPII was execrable (although the dinosaurs were still amazing.  Disney's DINOSAUR was similarly awful, with its awful, cloying, talking dinosaurs.  And then there's JPIII...JPIII is better than TLW JPII, but still displays the same annoying character-types, though III does the audience a favor and gives us less of them, so it gets points there.  The body count is also surprisingly slight at 3, so there's none of the excessive carnage of II.  But anyway, on to the thing that bothers me about this film basically, it's the fact of all these aggressive dinosaurs.  I can understand the raptors pursuing the humans; they're just the right size and easy to run down.  But what about the Spinosaurus, the upstart to T-Rex (in the franchise, anyway; I don't know where it stands on the evolutionary timeline)?  This thing is absolutely hell-bent on devouring these tiny tidbits that would barely serve as an appetizer.  At one point, it smashes through a thick iron and concrete fence to pursue them.  Either it really, really, hates humans, for some reason, or really likes how they taste, but no creature would expend such a tremendous amount of energy for any good-sized prey animal, let alone such a paltry payoff as a couple of humans (no matter how good they taste).  Especially not when there are large herds of large, meaty, herbivorous dinosaurs everywhere.  They certainly wouldn't risk injury by smashing through a fortified gate.Then there are the Pterodactyls.  These also are tremendously aggressive, viciously attacking the humans as if they're their normal prey.  Not only do these things strike me as being far too vicious, they also seem way too big (and the mechanical models used for close-ups of their faces don't look all that real).If it looks like I'm over-analzying this film, I'm sorry.  I know how that annoys some people.  But if one can't express one's opinion, however trivial, on a forum like this, what can one do?  I also know that this film is geared for nothing but entertainment; a big, loud, comic-book thrill ride.  But is that all this genre is going to be?  Big, loud, toothsome dinosaurs chasing loud, stupid, uninteresting humans?  If so, I'll have to say this is the last ride for me.By the way, I left one CGI dino movie off the list above and that's the 3-D IMAX film T-Rex Back to the Cretaceous.  The T-Rex scenes are awesome in that movie but also, unfortunately, very scant, which I'm assuming is because of budget constraints.  Most of the movie deals with a paleontologist and his daughter.  Still, it doesn't have to do with dinos doggedly pursuing people and it's worth watching for the amazing 3-D effect.

There've been a lot of comments about how much of a thrill ride this movie is, but I'm not so sure...  Isn't it only a thrill if you care at all about any of the characters?  Tea Leoni does what I'd thought impossible upstage Julianne Moore in the category of Annoying Character.The Plot.  Not much to report there.  It's more like an excuse to get the action going. (I think the plot is familiar by now to anyone reading up on this movie, so I'll proceed with that in mind) Again, why should we care about anybody stupid enough to send their kid parasailing off the coast of an island teeming with aggressive dinos?  Or mindless enough to shout at full volume right after being attacked by a dino said to be larger than T-Rex (actually just longer).  More dumbness the man who accompanies the kid onto the island (and saves his life) is reduced to a skeleton and never mentioned again.  Tea Leoni gets entangled with this skeleton and after screaming her fool head off and running off into the jungle still screaming (again, with several carnivorous dinosaurs lurking about) but is otherwise remarkable unbroken up about it, considering it was her boyfriend.  Anyway, the skeleton is nearly picked clean, but the boy's parents are somehow absolutely certain he's alive.  Of course he is, but the fact that he does puts a severe strain on the suspension of disbelief.  How clever and resourceful would he be without leftover supplies such as gas grenades? When asked how he collected a beaker full of T-Rex pee (to scare off other dinosaurs), the boy replies You don't want to know.  Um, actually, I kind of would, but dumb as this movie is, I don't expect an answer.  You're just expected to believe this kid could survive for 8 weeks on a hostile jungle island on nothing more than candy bars.  Right.  Sure.The Spinosaurus.  One reviewer commented about how much cooler it would have been if the Spino fought the T-Rex at the end of the film.  I couldn't agree more.   Actually, I was kind of upset that the T-Rex's neck got snapped I was expecting a rematch between the two and maybe have the Rex save the day (sort of like in the first movie).  Perhaps they could have the Spino chase away the raptors and the T-Rex confront the Spino.  But no.  The ball was dropped and all we got was the the frigging army showing up at the island to save the day (BOOOOOO!  HISSSSS).  Probably the most anti-climactic ending ever seen.  Anyway, this Spino creature is described on the JPIII's very website as being primarily a fish-eater and that its teeth were conical, whereas the T-Rex's teeth had cutting edges. Really, which do you think would win in a fight?  Frankly, I think the T-Rex would reduce the Spino to mincemeat.  T-Rex is still king.

He scavenges both the book and movie versions of Jurassic Park and the Lost World and attempts to piece together an intelligible work to submit to Professor Spielberg.  Unfortunately, Johnston's interest in the subject matter is obviously limited to box office profits. It would be nice to see a film that was bold enough to portray dinosaurs as the awe-inspiring, radically unique creatures of yestereon that made my childhood visits to the museum so exciting (Disney's Animated Dinosaur does not count).  Instead, JP III surrenders to the terrible lizard image by portraying the dinos once again as ever-hungry disaster machines.  And the plot is so tiring.  How many times can Hollywood writers get a bunch of people on an island to get eaten by dinosaurs?  Oops, was that a spoiler?  With the attention to detail afforded to this film, that is about as close as you get to a spoiler. Even the special effects that were synonymous with the first film are laughable in this installment.  The only potentially visually intriguing scene in the entire movie was plagued by dinos that seemed to have been constructed at Jim Henson's Creature Shop.  And don't count on Sam Neill or William H. Macy to save the day (even though they most certainly do on Isla Sorna). Neill's once firm Dr. Grant is now goofy and stumbling.  Macy might have been good, had he not been paired with Tea Leoni.  Leoni is most certainly eye candy, which may be why she was cast, but she is very unconvincing as Macy's on-screen wife.  The couple is creepy at best.  Alessandro Nivola's is predictable playing the generic Billy Brennan who seems to be Dr. Grant's understudy/adopted child.  And last, but definitely least, Laura Dern makes a small appearance to explain why she isn't in most of the movie and to remind us it is better to stay at home than to get eaten by dinosaurs.  The only oddly suspenseful aspect of the movie was that I never knew who was going to die next, simply because any of them could have died and it wouldn't have made the slightest bit of difference.

But they were way off from even the velociraptors in other movies. The scenes also seemed choppy and didn't really add to the story line. If you took all the island scenes and mixed them up you would have gotten the same story set up. This movie sacrificed movie plot for the special dinosaur effects (which are only impressive if used correctly - which they were not). Too much was told to the audience instead of being shown by scenes and subtleness. I don't like the part where allen grant and Ellie were in their kitchen and all of a sudden allen has a revelation that he explains in detail which gives away all suspense that people might have.

I mean we all know they are bad and vicious from the first movie, so that wasn't needed to drive the point that these are bad creatures that will kill. It just would have been a terrifying moment for the audience to find out that the velociraptors are talking to each other and they can communicate attack patterns. Also the camera work was shaky in some of the birdcage scenes. You never knew what was going on and therefore didn't really feel any danger for the characters.

If I were the screenwriter, I'd have the raptors, after taking the eggs, become vicious again. The group takes out the T-Rex urine, and splashes it all over the raptors. The raptors become confused, when suddenly the Spineosaurus, smelling the urine, comes and battles the raptors. The group makes a dash for the sea, where the Spineosaurus races after them. The army then battles the giant creature.THAT'S an ending!

The first film had depth. The first film had wonder. It had character. I'm not talking about the characters, I'm talking about the film itself. JP2, and to a lesser extent this movie, were far more concerned showing you as many different types of dinosaurs fighting in different ways than showing you the wonder and majesty of these animals. They tried to make a movie that was the last half of JP1, without the first half (Which many people hated. As a dinosaur lover since before I can remember, I loved it) and they ended up with a dozen or so strung together scenes with no reason behind why they were strung together.Or maybe the glamour is gone the third time around. In any case, if you plan on seeing this movie, and you have not seen JP1 or JP2, I suggest you go rent them first, and after seeing them, remember that this one is much more like 2 than it is 1.

Both are capable actors going way beneath their talent. Trevor Morgan plays their son who is about as bad as any kid who wanders away from their parents at the mall.

The entire tale revolves around an ill-gotten trip to the island of the first film, where dinosaurs now roam free. The script has its good moments, and Sam Neil's reprisal of the lead role from the first film is a plus.That said, the problem with these movies is that once you've seen the first one, you've kind of seen them all. The basic plot is that there's a terrible problem where a group of people are being chased by dinosaurs. Some people get eaten. Some don't.

He doesn't even manage to snack a handful people, which is embarrassing in connection with the ludicrous actions of the humans. And taken that the main plot is about a boy living for several weeks under those creatures, i salute to the director/writers for making the Dino's look this stupid (beside the obvious aliens-ripoff-idea).The movie simply jumps around between stereotypical oh it's so close i don't think they'll make it-action-scenes, oh my god, this is an abomination of nature-Sam Neil and long and boring character scenes without ever making anything look interesting.

Both Michael Crighton and Stephen Spielberg must be furious at the deterioration of the series, based on the poor quality of this sequel...just go back and watch the brilliance of the first JP. Even JP II was better than this, and that's not saying much. If not for Sam Neill's involvement this time around, I'd have dismissed this one entirely.  He's the only character I had any sympathy and admiration for, every other major character in the movie added nothing to the film.  I especially kept praying that Tea Leoni's character would get eaten messily by the Spinosaurus throughout the film.  Her constant screaming and whining was just annoying. Whatever happened to the smart and CAPABLE female character? Tea's character could take a lesson from Julianne Moore's character in JP II, now there was a tough lady.  William Macy's character was too one dimensional and I couldn't understand why he still loved Tea's character.  She's a shrew! The son was pretty self reliant, but a little too smart alecky.  It was nice to see Laura Dern turn up in this movie, but her role is miniscule and is an utter waste of her talent.It is obvious right from the beginning of the movie that the script was being worked out as it was being filming, which may be okay for other movies, but is inexucusable for this one. There are so many plot holes and inconsistencies, it's pitiful.  I found the climax to be a bit hard to swallow, and a tremendous let down (like most of the film itself). Too deux ex machina for me. *WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!!*My real problem with the end of the movie is that it contradicts everything the previous JP films have set up. There's simply no way that the raptors would let the group go just because Sam emits a cry for help on that dinosaur artifact. Tea's character stole the raptors' eggs (why?), the raptors know this, and the raptors have not shown to be merciful in either of the previous films. Based upon their previous behavioral patterns, the raptors would have attacked the humans and at least killed and eaten a few of them (let them start with Tea's character).The raptors' behavior in the climax makes them look stupid, which forever tarnishes their reputation as fearsome and intelligent creatures.  You could actually say that for most of the dinosaurs in the movie, from T-Rex to Spinosarus to the Pterodactyls.  Apparently the Pterodactyls are just like modern birds, since the ones in this movie fly right beside the rescue helicopters at the end, presumably towards the mainlands (why don't they attack the humans in the helicopters?).And how did Laura Dern's character know where the hell the group was to be able to alert what appears to be the entire US Armed Forces to rescue them? Sam's character doesn't mention anything to her about locations in his desperate, too brief, and half inaudible distress call, there are tons of islands in the area, and the rescue parties get there faster than Speedy Gonzales. Finally, why couldn't the stupid parents do the same thing in the beginning after their son's disappearance and avoid this catastrophe of a movie from ever happening?!!?

At no point was the movie ahead of the audience, well written, or innovative.  No one questions the technical expertise displayed here, but it's beginning to seem as if we've reached a point where screenplay and actors are used simply to construct a venue for the newest special effects.  The only good thing that can be said about this movie is at least it's not Hollow Man.

Very bad.  So bad, in fact, that there's little, if anything, that can be salvaged out of this rancid film that could remotely be considered good.  Sure, it'll make its money . . . in fact, it'll probably make enough to ensure a `JP4' (shudder) . . . but if you're considering going to see this movie, I'd strongly advise you not to go.  In fact, I'll beg you not to go.  Please.  This is easily one of the worst films released in 2001.  The ill-advised plot of `JP3' is as follows  Doctor Alan Grant (Sam Neill), desperate for funding on a dinosaur dig, accepts a strange offer from a wealthy couple, Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) - take them on an aerial tour of the original Jurassic Park island, and receive unlimited funding for his research efforts.  Since he only expects to have to fly over the island, he's abruptly surprised when his plane actually lands on the island.  It turns out that the couple's fourteen-year old son Eric (Trevor Morgan) is lost somewhere on the island, and they need to find and rescue their precious child.  Of course, the plane gets wasted by dinosaurs shortly after touchdown, so now Dr. Grant, the Kirbys, and the rest of the plane's crew must fight for survival as they find themselves being hunted by the ravenous dinosaurs, who, according to Dr. Grant, may be smarter than most scientists ever thought possible . ..On paper, this might have seemed like a good idea, but on screen, it's utterly preposterous and stupid.  The story is so thin, it's almost embarrassing.  Every line uttered in this film is essential to moving along the main plot.  It sounds like the actors were given Cliff's Notes instead of a script.  While there's something to be said for economy in dialogue, `JP3' pushed it to the point of being ridiculous.  (The line `Did you hear something?' - which must have been uttered at least five times during this film - is apparently code for `A dinosaur will be jumping out of the shadows in the next ten seconds.')  There's no real reason given to care about anyone in this film; the fact that they're trapped with vicious dinosaurs is apparently supposed to be reason enough.  Since the characters are stupid enough to bring most of their miseries upon themselves, though, it's difficult to feel sorry for them.The behavior of the characters is ludicrous.  `Jurassic Park Island' is apparently infamous for being filled with vicious, man-eating dinosaurs - so, what does Amanda (Tea Leoni) do the instant the plane lands on the island?  She goes stomping into the wilderness - away from the rest of the group - armed with ONLY A BULLHORN, SCREAMING HER SON'S NAME AND SIGNALLING EVERY DINOSAUR ON THE ISLAND THAT A HUMAN SNACK HAS ARRIVED!!! There's at least two dozen other examples of this scattered throughout the film, examples of pure, abject stupidity on the part of the characters.  Dr. Grant keeps muttering at various points during the movie (just in case the audience missed it the first six thousand times it gets mentioned) that the dinosaurs must be smart . . . well, yes and no, Dr Grant.  The dinosaurs in this film are indeed relatively smart in comparison to the humans in this film, but only because the humans are such thick-skulled dimwits.  Brain-damaged field mice would be considered smart in comparison to the  humans in this film.Even in terms of just being a fun, dumb movie, `JP3' fails appallingly . . . all thanks to director Joe Johnston.  It's hard to imagine that somebody with a big budget and ILM-created dinosaurs could possibly make a boring movie . . . but Joe Johnston does just that.  Flat, dull, and unimaginative describe the action scenes involving the dinosaurs in `JP3'.  (And the scenes without the dinosaurs are pure Sominex.)  Dinosaurs pretty much just waltz into the appropriate scenes and start attacking people - there's virtually no attempt to build tension or to try to deliver maximum tension or impact with the creatures.  It's as though the audience is supposed to just sit back and marvel at how impressive-looking the dinosaurs are, and that should be exciting enough . . . here's a newsflash, Mr. Johnston.  It's not.   For a big budget, special effects-laden film, this is possibly one of the least visually impressive movies ever made.I genuinely feel sorry for Sam Neill and William H. Macy - on screen, they almost look apologetic for the terrible lines they have to deliver.  They try to put in some good performances, and they must be given credit for trying . . . but considering the garbage they're working with, it's no surprise that they can't pull it off.  As for Tea Leoni . . . good gravy, who told her she could act?  Every line she utters is pure crap - hammy, unbelievable, and delivered with such uncertainty, I became convinced she was reading off of a badly shaking TelePrompter.  I've seen worse performances . . . but they're usually in `direct to video' releases.  Did nobody else audition for this part?  Horrendous.`Jurassic Park' and `The Lost World' weren't exactly great films, but they were fun and entertaining, and possessed a certain sense of wonder and fear that made them worth watching.  `JP3' possesses none of the above positive criteria.  It does, however, possess the ability to inspire loathing and nausea from its abysmal direction and pitifully sparse, rotten screenplay.  To put it mildly, `JP3' stinks like an overflowing port-o-john.  The movie's a bad, bad joke.

Probably a lot like Jurassic Park III, an almost unwatchable third entry in an otherwise solid film series. Lacking the fun, suspense, and overall entertainment value of the first two films, Jurassic Park III is filled with moments of unintentional humor, tedium, and disappointment all around.Jurassic Park III begins almost identically to Jurassic Park The Lost World. A few people are enjoying their vacation a little too close to the dinosaur-infested Isla Sorna, and ends in disaster. One of these unlucky victims is an unlucky boy named Eric. Eric's divorced parents (who curiously were not with the boy at the time of this accident) are determined to go to Isla Sorna and find him, despite the dangers. They also manage to trick Dr. Alan Grant to come along with them (as well as a friend of Grant's named Billy Brennan). As expected, chaos ensues when they reach the island and there doesn't appear to be a way back home.I wonder if Jurassic Park III was initially planned as a children's film. The body count is much lower than that of the previous two films, and there's more chase scenes than actual violence. The characters seem more like cartoon characters than actual people, and the tone of the film feels more like a sitcom than a Sci-Fi action flick. Not to mention one scene that where three of the main characters are digging through dino doo, as well as an unbelievably awful dream sequence involving a talking dinosaur. My theory is further supported by Eric, the 12 year old son of the Kirbies (the couple that convinced Grant to come to the island with them) who survives on the island by himself for eight weeks and proves remarkably resourceful. This is a dramatic change from the children of the previous Jurassic Park films, but not a positive one.The fact is, the Jurassic Park films already require you to suspend your disbelief a bit, but Eric's impressive survival skills (among almost a dozen convenient escapes) pushes it all over the line.On the bright side, Jurassic Park III doesn't have a the horrendously slow beginning that the first two films had. The original film took at least an hour to really get going, and it took The Lost World a good 40 minutes. In Jurassic Park III, the chaos starts in about 20 minutes (which also shortens the overall run time to about 90 minutes). Unfortunately, the chaos isn't much more exciting than the talking in the first 20 minutes.While the first two Jurassic Park films were extremely suspenseful and unpredictable, Jurassic Park III is almost the opposite. Any and all boo moments can be seen from a mile away, meaning that successful scares are few to none. The action scenes are uninteresting and lack excitement. One scene in particular seems almost an exact copy of the dangling trailer scene from The Lost World, only much shorter, and lacking any suspense.Much of the suspense comes from the small body count. Now, there's no right way to say this part, but here goes More people needed to get eaten. I already mentioned that relatively few people get eaten, but it needs to be emphasized. Adding to my theory that this was initially supposed to be a kid's film, basically all the main characters live. At one point, it seemed Jurassic Park III might have changed it's mind and killed off a semi-important character, but we later discover the character didn't die at all (and I might add that this weak twist was also highly predictable).The entire film seems very cheap and just thrown together. The special effects, while not bad, are far less impressive (and believable) than those of the first two Jurassic Park flicks. And editing seems to be rushed as I spotted a large number of continuity issues.The acting is weak, though this has more to with the script than the actual performances. Because the characters in the film are mostly idiots (some seems unusually stupid), the actors appear to be idiots as well, which is something a film should never do. Especially irritating is Tea Leoni as Amanda Kirby, portraying the single-most stupid and annoying character in the entire Jurassic Park film series.John Williams did not score this third entry (despite his involvement with the first two), which only adds to both this film's slopped together feeling, and my ever-growing respect for the composer. However, replacement composer Don Davis does a pretty commendable job at utilizing Williams' existing themes. While Williams refrained from frequent use of the original's themes for The Lost World, Davis uses them freely and frequently. The score isn't as skilled as either of the previous entries in the series, but it's plenty of fun, and includes some very spirited arrangements of the main theme (especially at the end).Downright awful in almost every respect, Jurassic Park III isn't funny, isn't exciting, and isn't memorable. Having more in common with the Honey I Shrunk The Kid sequels than any of the Jurassic Park films, Jurassic Park III is a highly flawed and highly disappointing movie in just about every regard. And yet, this is not the end. After over a decade of being in Development Hell, Jurassic Park IV is finally getting made, which will hopefully wash out the bad taste that Jurassic Park III has left behind.

Dr. Alan Grant is still working on the fields. When a young boy goes missing over Site B, his parents track down Grant and tell him they want a fly over tour of the island. He reluctantly agrees for a large sum of money, but when they get there and land, he finds out that they're not rich at all, and they want him to lead them as they look for their son. Unfortunately, they don't know that there were two islands, and this is the one Alan Grant has never been to before. Jurassic Park III marks Steven Spielberg's departure from the series, and also the series' fall from grace. The acting, plot, and special effects are the worst here, and it makes you long for the crew of the first film.Steven Spielberg and Michael Crighton wanted to stick to dinosaur fact when they made the first two films, and they did a good job of that. In this movie, they try to make it look like the Velociraptors have evolved and they look more like birds now, complete with feathers sticking out of their head. They even hold intelligent conversation with each other, which makes the movie even more ridiculous. The main dinosaur of the movie switches from the T-Rex (which has only a small cameo in the film), and is now a Spinosaurus. This is another dinosaur ruined by the movie. The real Spinosaurus was 18-20 feet tall and far less vicious than the T-Rex. In this movie, it is closer to 50 feet and relentlessly stalks the people on the island. The Pterodactyl scene is so unbelievable that it makes me laugh. The whole plot of this movie is unbelievable and makes no sense. The style is different, and the dialogue is corny. This movie is a far cry from the first two films.The acting in this movie is astonishingly bad. Sam Neill was great as Alan Grant in the first film, but now he's just wooden with no emotion. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are terrible as the parents of a missing boy. They don't show any real determination in finding him. All they do is walk around and call his name. The other actors in the film aren't even worth mentioning.The first two films were really awesome, and this movie just ruins it all by trying to be so much better that it ends up worse.

So the real dad and mom drag Dr, Grant on a 'tour' get stranded (go figure) and spend two hours running for their lives after they find their sun eating 20 year old nestle crunch bars in an old truck for 8 weeks.

They *say* that they're a rich, affluent pair of thrill seekers who want Grant along for his expertise when they intend to go on a plane tour of Isla Sorna (the site of the second movie). As we can figure out, they're not playing it straight with him, and have another motive in mind. Predictably, the plane *does* land on the island. All Hell breaks loose as yet another gang of raptors and a particularly nightmarish menace called a spinosaur stalk our not too bright protagonists.Jurassic Park III really isn't all that bad. Of course it's going to come up short when compared to the first movie, but the filmmakers have crafted a reasonable thrill ride with a very good pace. Unlike the other movies in this series, this runs a mere 93 minutes (84 or so without the end credits), which goes to show that this kind of entertainment doesn't need to go on for very long. One understandable complaint is that the dinosaurs here don't do a lot of people munching; only a few characters get gobbled up, and you can pretty much guess who they'll be. This does manage to be somewhat intense nevertheless. It's *not* without its sillier and more annoying moments (the nightmare sequence comes to mind), and Ms. Leoni is unfortunately obliged to play the kind of twit whom we all hope and pray becomes dinosaur chow.All things considered, this is still better than the average SyFy cheese fest, if only because of the substantial major studio budget and the very talented crew. The special effects this time are variable - sometimes the dinosaurs look great, and sometimes they don't. The entire night time segment on the river is a solid set piece, and things culminate in what is a hilariously over the top resolution.Another thing giving this an edge over a more typical B movie is a cast of pros. They play the material for all that it's worth, with Neill doing a good job. Trevor Morgan is appealing as the obligatory child character Eric, and a couple of truly excellent character actors - Michael Jeter, John Diehl, Bruce A.

For starters, the film is way too predictable for its own good. As soon as the plane sets out you can pretty much pick who is going to live and who is going to die. As the film moves along there's actually very little suspense because you just know nothing is going to happen to certain characters. I'm going to avoid spoilers but what happens at the very end to one character was a very big joke. Another problem is that there's really not too much of a story but I'm going to give the film a minor break here because it actually falls into a B movie territory.

Once again the special effects, a mixture of CGI and real effects, are perfectly mixed in with the actors and for my money the effects were just as good as what was seen in the previous two movies.Another plus is that we're given a terrific cast of characters and while no one delivers Oscar-quality work, they're at least fun to watch. It was great getting to see Neill return for his role and it was nice getting to see Laura Dern as well. Both Macy and Leoni handle their roles just fine as does Trevor Morgan and Alessandro Nivola.Several people have attacked the B quality of the story but to me it works as long as you don't take it too serious. In fact, it really does play out like a nice little B movie that you'd see from the 1930's or 50's. JURASSIC PARK III is certainly minor entertainment but the important thing is that it keeps you entertained.

I thought the first one was good, but slightly overrated, and that the second one was average. Over time, I've come to elevate my view on the first film. However, out of the three, it is this third film that remains my favorite.The plot is simple. Sam Neill's Dr. Grant character is lured back to the island by a couple who's kid is stranded there. The film is fast, the dialogue stays on course, there is just enough room to segue into side plots without overdoing it, and everyone seems to be rolling along. William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are fine as the couple looking for their kid, and Alessandro Nivoli is also good as Billy, Dr. Grant's protégé here.The film doesn't ask you to think, but manages to keep your attention. There are plenty of dinosaurs to go round. If you want a fairly fast-paced action flick that deals with dinos, this is a good choice.

The story is a little predictable and far fetched, if not utterly ridiculous in places. And the effects are nowhere near as good as the first two films. One bonus is there is more sunlight in this film than the second so some of the action can actually be seen! But at the end of the day it's not THAT bad as some of the other reviews may claim, and is still quite fun and jumpy in places (though maybe less screaming by the woman would have been nice!) The film did have great parts to it that maybe could have been used in the first and second to give us a longer feature for those instead (and stay away from mainland cities too!) Overall, it's got dinosaurs. It's a bit of fun, and it'll pass the time on a rainy day. It's also a good starting point for kids and dino films as it's the mildest of them all.

THE DINOSAUR for example It isn't the T-rex who is the dominant, 2. it does not feature all the main characters from the last movies(I may understand this, but I wouldn't say it affects the movie, Alan Grant and his daugther is still in this), BUT they do very well anyway.

Listen&#x85;you hear that? and then Run! And that will tell you the whole story. Jurassic Park III is nothing more than a creature feature. It's a high-tech creature feature like its predecessor The Lost World Jurassic Park, but unlike that film, which was energetic and fun and most certainly unlike the first movie, which was full of spectacle, Jurassic Park III is a bland creature feature. It's not a total disaster and it's not hard to sit through, but unlike the first two movies, it just does not have the zest and energy and this could be attributed to the departure of Steven Spielberg as the director.In the movie, Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is asked by a pair of wealthy entrepreneurs (William H. Macy and Téa Leoni) to be their aerial guide as they fly over Isla Sorna, the island where genetically-engineered dinosaurs run amok. After being offered a huge paycheck, Grant agrees, and sure enough, as you'd expect, the plane crashes and the survivors are immediately running from peril from the prehistoric monsters roaming the jungles.And all that follows this is nothing but setup, and then running from the dinosaurs. Now this formula was used extensively throughout the running time of The Lost World Jurassic Park, but it was done with such efficient timing and energy that it was riveting entertainment. And the first Jurassic Park had a lot of dinosaur attacks, but what made it so special and profound was the sense of awe and majesty and wonder that Spielberg instilled into his mechanical and computer-generated creatures. The first movie had our jaws hung in awe and admiration, the second had us on a roller coast thrill ride. Jurassic Park III tries to mix a little of both of these, more the latter than the former, but in the end, it's too cliché, a little tiresome, and impoverished of imagination.Nobody really expects interesting characters in a Jurassic Park film, although it would be nice to see some. So the cast is really two-dimensional in terms of personality. But we don't go to the theater to see them. We go to see the dinosaurs.So what about the big lizards of Jurassic Park III? Well, again, they're the best thing in the movie, but even they are a little watered down. Visually, they are moderately impressive. The combination of life-sized animatronics and computer-generated imagery is well-done to generate the illusion. But what these dinosaurs lack is a sense of profound presence. We don't really feel any menace or majesty about them. Even when a dinosaur is tearing a person to shreds, there isn't much impact on the audience because the dinosaurs are losing interest as well. The new dinosaur antagonist, a spinosaurus, is convincing in appearance but very dull in terms of the way it's presented whereas say the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptors of the first two movies had a lot of screen presence. The t-rex has a cameo in this movie and the raptors are over-exaggerated to the point where they become unwieldy instead of realistically scary. And the other dinosaurs? The herbivores. Completely boring. Remember the magical moment in the brachiosaur scene of the first movie? It was spine-tingling and beautiful. There is none of that in the third movie. The only dinosaurs that are given any consideration are the meat-eating predators. Because the movie is more or less relying on them to save the day, expecting the audience to believe dinosaurs to be only scary monsters.Perhaps I'm being a little too rough on Jurassic Park III. There were a few moments including a fun scene where the characters contend with a pack of pterodactyls in a giant birdcage that I really enjoyed and the movie did not overstay its welcome due to a very rapid running time. In the end, I didn't hate the movie, I just didn't think it was on the same level as its two predecessors and wasn't all that enjoyable of a movie. I hope that Universal continues to scrap plans for a fourth movie, because the Excessive Sequel Syndrome is coming into effect and the Jurassic Park series is starting to run out of steam.

After all, it is tedious, annoying, and all too common, to have dinosaurs, aliens and various other monsters with human drives and emotions.  JPIII lets them be the inscrutable creatures they would have been.  And, as with the creatures, JPIII lets its people be people. There's no wise-cracking side-kick, no impossibly spunky child, no overwrought emotions.  Dr. Grant is a genuine scientist, tired and wishing he were anywhere but that island, but still capable of wonder.  The Kirbys act like normal people would under the circumstances.  Their hysterics are reserved for extreme moments and pass just as quickly, slipping back into their mundane behaviour as soon as the danger passes. There are no bigger-than-life heroes here; no comic relief.  Because of that, Jurassic Park III may have the kiss of death about it.  People wanting Die Hard action with sassy Rush Hour dialog are going to be disappointed.  JPIII doesn't follow the Hollywood mentality for stereotyping both character and action. Of course,in this era when films are critically panned for not being predictable, it seems unlikely that JPIII will be treated kindly.  But if you are bored with the clinical entertainment of Tomb Raider and Pearl Harbor or the blatant emotional manipulation of Castaway and AI you should find JPIII refreshing. Real people.

The movies went in their own directions, and were fine, but it always bothered me a bit that they strayed from the books in a number of ways. Well, this third movie pretty much takes all the missing pieces from the two books and slaps them together in one amazing dino fest. There aren't any drawn out lectures on why the dinos are and were a bad idea, or anything on extinction. What there are are imaginings of sequences from the books that were not in the last two movies. The pteranadon attack and the raft ride from the first book are adapted, fantastically. The new carnivore, Spinosaurus, is amazing to watch, and you forget that his sudden presence on Isla Sorna isn't explained at all. Personally in movies like that I let those things slide. The characters are as good as they need to be in a movie like this, and the end, which some people think is too abrupt, is fine as far as I'm concerned. The action is at a fever pitch, much moreso then the past two, where there were freqeunt rests between the action. All around, this movie breathes new life into the series. I hope they continue to explore new ideas and come out with a fresh and original JP4.

The thing is I think most people like it. There might be more negative reviews, but even some of the critics are liking it! Some people are having problems with it's story, it's acting, it's character development, even it's CGI!STORY What else could you have done for it. What clever idea can you do to get dinosaurs chasing and eating people. Well there isn't. So I really wouldn't dis the story line. I thought it was better, by far! Better than TLW's! ACTING We were introduced to really good actors. Sam Neill, who is certainly my fav. actor, is excellent in this film. He makes everything around him seem very believable! William H. Macy, a great actor who is really known from his great film Fargo, plays his character very well. Tea Leoni, she really hot in Family Man, plays her charater well, but has an anoying scream. But, please, is that what why we say the movie is bad? Trevor Morgon, yes he's a kid, he did well and found himself not anoying like TLW's KELLY. Not high wire gymnastic stunts! Alessandro Nivola, this guy plays in Face Off which I really don't remember seeing him in, does a great job! He made me care about his character. Micheal Jeter, Del in Green Miles; always liked him, does good too. Funniest lines are from him!CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT Ok, everybody on here seems to have a problem with it, when there really isn't. Every scene had character development up till the moment of the spinosaur. All of them had motives, and that was good. Maybe I really didn't quite get to know NASH or COOPER well enough, but they made great snack food for SPINY!CGI I hoped no one had a problem with it, cause I sure didn't! None of the dinosaurs seemed fake. Unlike in TLW, REX had some fake problems with his feet! Watch it and pause and see for your self! The rex vs. spino battle was something no ther movie ever had in history. Making it look real I mean!A problem that one of the commenters had was this Not only did Grant's wife know that they were at Isla Sorna, but sent all these troops to rescue them. Clearly he did not listen or watch anything that was said or seen in the movie. Ellie is not Grant's wife, and she is not his girlfriend. Her husband works for International relations, so he has connections! And Grant clearly said to her on the phone, SITE B, which is Isla Sorna! Other problems people are talking about is the action. How can the action suck? It was has more than any other movie. Mindless action? What's mindless about it? Basically this meets the first Jurassic Park's level or surpasses it. That was one thing Jurassic Park had missing, was not enough action. And the series was really not meant to be a Masterpiece only a thrill ride and awing movie! Nothing more, and nothing less. And I guess TLW missed something too. It missed freshness, which is what JP3 gave. TLW was just a rehash. So I give JP3 10/10!

My next greatest disappointment was that this movie left me wanting more.  There just wasn't enough time to fully develop the full potential of this storyline.  The more I think about the good parts made me feel that there could, nay should, have been more.The best part of the movie was the return of Dr. Alan Grant.  I was disappointed with the second instalment because only Ian Malcolm returned (don't get me wrong, I did enjoy Jeff Goldblum's performance, but he just wasn't the chaotician he was in the first instalment).  Kudos to Sam Neill for a bang-up performance.The special effects were awesome, and the new look for the raptors was cool.  The brief but impressive battle between the big dinosaur and the T-Rex was cool; I only wished that it lasted longer with greater detail.The only thing is that this movie should have been longer.  In that extra span of time, they (Grant and Billy) should have been briefly discussing why the appearances of the raptors changed and about how this new dinosaur came to be, one that was not included on Ingen's list.  Mutant aberrations?  Too much in-breeding?  Something to do with amphibian DNA?  It would have been nice to hear their take on it, but if they need to cut costs, why not cut out scientific discussions.Although its only been my first viewing of the movie, it seemed as though Grant and Billy were unable to catalogue the dinosaur with the spines.  There were a few guesses, but Grant dismissed them.This movie left me asking the question, Why?I do not claim to be a dinosaur expert, but I have to ask  with so many large herbivores (which may not be quite right to begin with considering the number of carnivores in such a small area), how is it that everything is so lush and green?  According to the informational documentary Walking with Dinosaurs, such herbivores take many years to grow (providing that they survive), and they eat continuously throughout the day, and even knock over the trees to the ground if they have to.Another question (although they did not dwell on it much in the movie) would be (and I hate to do this, but)...***SPOILER ALERT***  ***SPOILER ALERT***  ***SPOILER ALERT*** ...how is it that a kid at the age of 15 could survive in a land infested with carnivores for eight weeks?  Not only that, but he was hiding at the Site B compound, right smack in the middle of, if memory serves me, raptor territory.  Reading Grant's two books and Malcolm's book would not prepare anyone for the vigours of surviving a prehistoric world.  They just referred to the kid as being resourceful.  Great.  That explains everything.  He should have been a dino treat within a few days.I have other such (or similar) questions, but I will no longer bore you.  I just have a (bad) habit of over-analysing movies I really like.  In a few days, it will all be a distant memory.Despite how I feel about the negative aspects of the movie, the action and suspense were enough to cancel them out and more.  I just loved this movie, and I cannot wait to purchase it, hopefully later this year.

The relationships between the characters are quite cliche, especially the divorced couple who joins forces to rescue their child and by doing so they rekindle their love. But it works. The cast is superb and you really care for those character (in fact, it's not hard to figure out quite early on in the movie who's cannon fodder and who's going to survive).    The dinosaurs are great looking as usual, but the thrills are also exciting and original. We are even treated to a brief fight between two big dinosaurs and some new dinosaurs species that were featured in the original book, but were absent from the first two movies.   I only think that the climax could have slightly more... Er... Climatic, and considering how frightening the evil dinosaurs are, it's a bit of a shame that the movie is not really scary or gorey.

The movie timing is perfect, it runs very smoothly. I don't understand why people complained about the length. It has a great mix of dinosaurs. Less deaths, which actually makes for a more suspenseful movie. You don't say `Oh, this one is going to die.' You actually FEEL for these characters. The effects are fantastic. In fact, there were only 3 small scenes that you could tell the difference between CGI and Animatronic. Sure, it doesn't have a thick plot, but the only reason JP had a plot is because it had a book to base it off of. LW tried to have a plot independent of its book, but failed. Jp3 is EXACTLY what the JP series needs. The comedy was FAR from corny like a lot of `critics' have said.I also don't understand how people think it is stupid to have dinosaurs just for the sake of showing them, but I disagree. After all, what do you think the Parasaurolophus mixed in with the Brachiosaurs were for in the original JP. Let's not forget the Gallimimus and baby Triceratops in LW.

Anyone who saw this film and posted a negative review obviously missed the point entirely of this picture.This is a great movie, and a worthy successor in the famous (and successful) Jurassic Park franchise.  Spielberg was not in the director's chair for this third installment (he had promised the late Stanley Kubrick that he would do A.I.) but his protege Joe Johnston (who also directed rampaging CGI animals in Jumanji) did a marvelous job and brought his own touches and techniques onto the scene, giving the series a fresh new look and feel.Despite complaints that this movie is only 90 minutes long, a lot of action is packed into that time.  The movie never felt too short, and the 92-minute time is just right.  You think it would be better to have an extra half-hour of pointless talk or meaningless action just to say that this movie is 120 minutes?  We already know the background story, so that kind of thing, present in the first two JP movies, is not needed here, and is graciously absent.If you know your dinosaur facts, then you know that the raptors are not laughable, but are actually as accurate as they have ever been, as new discoveries prove that they really did in fact have feathers and were able to communicate.  Also, accept the fact that the tyrannosaurus was not the largest carnivore.  Just because we give an animal a name that means tyrant lizard king doesn't mean it really was one, and we know that the spinosaurus seen in JP3 (which WAS a real dinosaur) was indeed larger and stronger than T-rex, as were several other carnivorous dinosaurs that aren't seen in this film.This, like JP1 and Lost World, is not a kid's movie. Don't be fooled by last year's Dinosaur that all dinosaur things are kids stuff.  JP3 is scary, violent, and intense (even moreso than the first two), and it is meant for teens and adults.  Shame on the parents who bring their preschoolers to see this movie, only to have them scream and cry throughout a few of the movie's more panicking sequences.  Send the kiddies off to see Shrek and leave this one for the age 10+ crowd.Sam Neill is back as Dr. Grant (thankfully... no offence to Jeff Goldblum's character) and Laura Dern makes a couple of (sometimes humurous) cameos.  The cast of humans are all great, and the human element - character development, etc. - is stronger than it was in the previous installments.  But the real stars are the dinosaurs.  In 1993, everyone said Wow, those movie dinosaurs look real.  With this movie, you will be saying These aren't movie dinosaurs, they ARE real.JP3 has a terrific story line and plot.  In one sentence, I would say that this is one big wonderful entertaining thrill-fest.  Not all movies have to be complicated pieces of artsy-fartsy junk filled with symbolism and iconography and complex plot twists.  Sometimes you just want to relax and be entertained by a big popcorn thriller without having to think 40 steps ahead in the action.  Jurassic Park III fills the bill perfectly, and then some.

Sometimes they come out okay, but most of the time they are a disgrace to the original. Well, Jurassic Park III might have been cashing in on Jurassic Park a bit, but it is still a solid action movie.Sam Neill reprises his role as Dr. Alan Grant from the first film. He has recently been trying to get funding for a new scientific process revolved around dinosaurs. His theory states that velociraptors used to Talk to each other by means of vocalization in the throat. High pitched screams, if you will. Unfortunately for Grant, no one really cares about this - they all want to hear about his experience at John Hammond's Jurassic Park. A tired Grant, exhausted from having to explain all the time, now ignores questions about the park, as we see in the beginning of the film when he says, Any questions? And everyone raises their hands. He then says, Any questions NOT regarding Jurassic Park? Everyone puts their hands down.Desperately seeking money for his funding, Grant reluctantly agrees to fly over Isla Sorna - site B of Jurassic Park (the island in the first sequel) - with rich explorers/couple William H. Macy and Tea Emma Thompson lookalike Leoni. But after their plane lands on the island, Grant realizes the truth behind the couple's story...and comes face-to-face with a new breed of dino.Jurassic Park III's respect for the original comes in very handy. It is easy to see that the filmmakers were ready to try again after the awful Lost World sequel, and they pulled it off well.Steven Spielberg has since handed over the reigns to new-yet-old director Joe Johnston. `'Jurassic Park' is one of those turning points in movies,' Johnston states. `They put a living, breathing dinosaur on the screen. These are hard movies to make.' Well, if I do say so myself, `Jurassic Park III' is every bit better than `The Lost World Jurassic Park' and a step down from the original, which is where sequels should be. Not that I don't like sequels to surpass the originals. I do like that. But sometimes sequels try too hard to overcome the original (`Lost World') and fail miserably. What Johnston and team did is great. They knew they couldn't beat the original, so they spiced it up in other areas. They didn't re-hash the original.For instance, there is more of a man-against-nature feel in this film. Dr. Grant and friends are trapped in this marsh land and are surrounded by dinosaurs. Unlike they could in the first film, the humans have nowhere indoors to go. It's man-against-nature, and it creates a very pleasant mix of paranoia and suspense for the audience, and some lush landscapes.At times I feel like I could reach out and grab the marsh they are in. Unlike some films (including the original, to a certain degree) the plants don't look fake. They have the same look as the first film (remember all those ferns?) without looking as cheesy. They don't look like plastic.And much is the same with the ever-improved dinosaurs. The detail on the dinos is amazing in this film. Their muscles move care-free, their skin has the coating of a lizard, and we feel like they are real. There is an excellent scene with a fighting t-rex and spinosaurus. You simply can't get your dino fix any better than that.If you read my original review on `Jurassic Park,' I state how much I hate it when CGI is not-so-seamlessly blended with puppets and plastic models. One scene the creatures are moving carefree when they are digitalized, in another they are puppets that move slow with no muscles. Well, that's what I enjoyed about the `Jurassic Park' trilogy. THE DINOSAURS LOOK REAL WHEN THEY ARE CGI AND PUPPET. You can't tell when it's CGI and when it's fake puppets. We can thank the best creature effects man out there Stan Winston, whose work I have appreciated since `The Terminator' to `Predator' (extra koudos on that suit!) to `Terminator 2 Judgment Day.' Winston is the best, plain and simple.And the acting in this sequel is nothing to fuss about. Unlike the complete one-eighty Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) did in the first film-to-sequel - from annoying guy to brave, annoying guy who thinks he's smart - Grant is the same as always. He reminds me of Indiana Jones - and no, not because of the hat. It is because his personality is the same. He doesn't really enjoy what he's doing, but he does is anyway, because he is Grant, and that's his job.William H. Macy uses his acting ability to full advantage here - I still say he'd make great as Ned Flanders if they ever made a live-action `Simpsons' movie/show.I have read both `Jurassic Park' books by Michael Crichton. The first novel is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have read a few thousand. It easily blends everything you want in a novel. Something about the way Crichton writes gets me hooked even if the story stupid. I recently read `Rising Sun.' Most books I start to read nowadays I read one hundred pages into and drop. I've been guilty of this with John Grisham and Robert Ludlum novels. But I finished `Rising Sun' in a few busy days. What I'm trying to get at here, is that Michael Crichton is one of my favorite living authors, if not THE favorite. And I must say, his books have been done justice - well, at least the first one. I respect that one of my favorite books by one of my favorite authors was treated well. The third film wasn't based on a book, but it still does justice to the roots of the tale, and that is always good.`Jurassic Park III' is more than just a surprising sequel.4/5 stars "},{"Title":"Oh dear, oh dear oh dear oh dear","Date":"16 January 2002","Score":"7 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  Simple as this, this movie wasDull, boring, unorginal, BORING,and those are just the words which i can be bothered to think about, this movie sucked big time in every sense of the word.The acting in my opinion wasn't so bad as to spoil the film, it was bearable altho at times i DID want to kill Doctor Grant.

However, by the end of the film, it was apparent that this hope was indeed false.  The cinematography was a bit too cartoony, especially during the plane crash/T-rex sequence.  Are we watching an action/sci-fi film or the latest episode of Looney Tunes? Also, while the dinosaur effects were indeed impressive, it seemed to me that the CGI artists utilized a little too much artistic license while creating them. It is true that we don't actually know what color dinosaurs were, but having purple T-Rexes running around is a bit of a stretch.  Finally, I would like to comment on the ending (If you haven't seen the film yet and would genuinely like to, then I suggest reading no further).  To the viewer, it would appear that the writers ran out of ideas come the end of the screenplay.  It is for this reason that the MARINES rescue Dr. Grant and his fellow travellers.  The ending lacked an overall feeling of suspense, which was instead replaced with abruptness.  Perhaps so much of the budget was spent hiring Sam Neill and William H.

These dinosaurs seem they're more from the ASBO generation of harassment than 65 million years ago, causing such provocative hassle for our cast within just ninety minutes.There is too much wrong with this film and although a few of the DVD special features provide some 'excuses' concerning the drastic change, it doesn't redeem the fact that it has detracted from the mysterious magic and awe of its forerunners.

Macy and Tea Leoni) as their anniversary gift to each other.It turns out that he's not what he seems and in short course, they end up trapped on the island, with some very large, very dangerous, and very hungry predators (and a few velociraptors that are using vocalizations to communicate) who want to make lunch out of them.It's an exciting, fast-paced movie, once it gets going and it doesn't let up until the very last frame.Because of the advances in computer-generated imagery since the first movie, this film easily looks and feels more real than the other two movies and the director shows what he can do with the technology available to him.This film would also be an excellent point to end the Jurassic Park series, in my view.

Joe Johnston does a really good job though. It's obviously going to have a different approach to the material because of this, but ultimately it works quite well.Admittedly, it's a significantly different kind of film. It's extremely fast paced and by this I mean you have the cast already on the island and being pursued by the main dinosaur on the JP3 logo within the first 15 minutes! There are some things that seem unanswered in the film but overall I feel these things can be looked over. Also the sprinkled attempts at humor had me laughing but at the same time had me raising my eyebrows because it felt slightly out of place in the world of Jurassic Park.The film is a lot shorter. It's about an hour an a half as opposed to the other films being over two hours long. So overall as you can see, it's quite a bit different from the other two. But this is a Joe Johnston film, not a Steven Spielberg film and I feel the director shouldn't try to totally duplicate what was done before him and that he needs to make his own movie. Just so long as he doesn't change things around so drastically that it is no longer the same. Thankfully Johnston still captures that old adventurous Jurassic Park feeling and provides highly memorable and breathtaking action sequences. Sam Neill, who is one of my favorite actors, is back and reprises his role as Dr. Grant and it's really great to see him back in the hat! While the plot may be very simplistic the film does enrich the world of Jurassic Park. Obviously Ingen is still up to no good and creating dinosaurs that weren't originally 'on the list' as was stated. Here we have the addition of the Spinosaurus, Ankylosaurus, and various other dinos.The music by Don Davis is superb. He integrates the memorable themes by John Williams and uses them superbly in his own original music.The special effects by ILM are terrific as ever. Some of my favorite big moments being the confrontation between the T-Rex and Spinosaurus, The Bird Cage sequence (especially the build up to where the Pterondon is walking on the bridge) and the Brachiosaurus greeting the boat. It's a fantastic quick journey back to the island of dinosaurs and I must say it's a fun and highly memorable one!

(more on this later)The good bits? - There's only one kid in this, and he is less annoying then either of the two from the first film. There is a greater attempt to portray the Dinosaurs as the stars, which is how it should be - If you want to watch Sam act, watch something like a death in Brunswick or The Piano.The set pieces were done very well, particularly the carnosaur-carnosaur fight and the way in which the Velociraptors were not simply shown as cartoon villains worthy of moustaches, but rather behaving like intelligent predators.On to the aforementioned deliberate mistakes with the dinosaurs1) The Spinosaurus Egypticus - Roughly the size of a T-rex, NOT noticably bigger, the sail indicated a cold-blooded animal, as such the idea that it could despatch a similarly sized and protected hot-blooded animal (theT-rex) when the T-rex had more advanced teeth (serrated, larger sockets in the jawline for more muscle power/bite) and would be able to move and react a lot quicker is a tad laughable.2) A full-grown Velociraptor stood a decidedly less-impressive three feet high weighing at most 15kgs. Rather different than portrayed in the entire trilogy. What they did get right is the large brain/body-size ratio making the Dromaeosaurid family (to which it belongs) up to three times smarter than the smartest T-rex. What they should have done from the outset is show Deinonychus, the Velociraptor's bigger cousin standing over five feet tall and weighing 80 kilos. This dinosaur was so advanced that some paleontologists believe it may have had primitive feathers. The biggest dinosaur in this species was the Utahraptor (no prizes for guessing where it came from) at around Twelve feet high and weighing close to a ton.3) Pteradons (the flying creatures represented) weighed about 35 pounds, could not have even lifted the kid in the picture, were far more lightly built and a full grown man could easily have crushed the neck of one. Incidentally, all Pterodactyloids were reptiles, not dinosaurs!Food for thought - Glad that the series has generated so much interest in the subject!

The effects were very amazing, and awe stunning ( warning, may be too much for the younger children this time around though)  this movie is honestly for the people a little older and who can handle the intense and dazzling effects.  The plot wasn't bad, there was just not too much depth thats all, that doesn't mean it sucked.  This film is not Jurassic Park, but it is most likely the closest that we are going to get to it again though.  I liked this movie a lot.  I gave it two thumbs up, and so did everyone else I saw it with, the first time (out of the two times I've seen it) the film got an applause, never got that at the second film.  I liked it and i am very excited to get it on DVD right away.  I will say though, that this was a surprise, but this is the best that they are going to do, if there is a fourth, they are going to have to work very very hard to top this one off, and it will be impossible to top Jurassic Park off.  One thing that may help if they would have to make a fourth, would be to keep some of the original actors from either the first, or the third, and then add a few (smart)new comers, but if there wouldn't be some people that you love from the 1st or 3rd, then there may not be anything that you will want to go back to.  It will also be hard to top off those effects.  I think that this movie was really good, and it was nice to have a good movie this summer, so far many of them have been a disappointment.

I expected too much out of it, and what was the stuff about T-Rex getting onto San Diego. Let's keep them on the island, I ended up only seeing it maybe three times in theaters. And I'm still debating on whether I should buy the DVD. And now, ironically, four years later, Jurassic Park III hits the big screen. I am one of those hardcore JP fans, and I must say that this movie was one of the greatest sequels Hollywood has ever made.When I first heard of them making another sequel, I thought, Oh man. But then, the news started rolling in. Sam Neill is going to reprise his role as the infamous Dr. Alan Grant, who was sorely missed in the second film. I thought he did such a fantastic job, that he topped all of his other films. Then came Laura Dern as a cameo. She does a great job, and it seems to be more than just a cameo role. It was a vital role for this film to be a success. William H. Macy, Tea Leoni, and Trevor Morgan, make the characters realistic, and I'm not usually a fan of Tea's, but this film made me want to go back and see her other films.Then, of course, there are the dinosaurs. Spinosaur kicked major butt in this film. He knocked the crap out of T-Rex. The raptors were finally smart. The first one, they were mysterious. In the second one they were clumsy and stupid, but in this one they were very intelligent. They learned to set traps, and learned to look at all their options before attacking, thus proving Grant's theory about their intelligence. I've only seen it once, but trust me, it won't be the only time. I plan to see this film more than ten times in theaters, and, not to mention, buy the DVD when it comes out in December.

The whole movie is filmed in nature and it's such a pleasure to watch it.  Your eyes will be satisfied, the settings are amazing.  As for the dinosaurs, I have never seen anything like it!  They are incredible and I doubt it's possible to make them look more realistic then this.The movie is full of action, just like many people have said, it's a THRILL RIDE.  You never get bored, it's non stop action.  Another good thing is that there's also humor at the right places.  In my opinion, all the actors played their roles perfectly.  The action sequences are incredible and very realistic.  In other words, the dinosaurs react and move just like they would probably have if they were alive, they are  based on real scientific research.Also each action sequence is basically a story on its own.  It's not literally dinosaurs chasing humans the whole time, the action sequences are much more sophisticated and very different from each others.  IMO, this new director has done an incredible job.  I also enjoyed seeing the flying dinosaurs (I forget their name) and of course Spinosaurus, T-Rex, Raptors among many others.This is what a dinosaur movie should be like, they are in THEIR surroundings & territory (meaning the forest) which is incredible to see.  It's probably my favourite Jurassic Park movie and I suggest to everyone to go see it and judge for yourself.  If you don't, then it's your loss.  I recommend it to anyone who loves dinosaurs/nature or action movies in general.

I guess there is nothing to please you all. For goodness sakes it was better than The Lost World. The only reason you like to put TLWJP above JP3 simply because it was directed by Spielberg. Yes Spielberg can direct good movies, but he not perfect. He failed at The Lost World and your just gonna have to admit it.JP3 is everything The Lost World should have been. Acting is what it should be.As I heard from one of the commenters we don't want purple t-rexes around here. First of all there weren't any purple Rexes. Not even close to the color purple. Which makes me wonder if you even saw the movie. Next I heard someone say the effects wasn't as good as the first. The effects have improved dramatically from the first looking even more real than ever. If you noticed that the dinosaurs actually had their muscles jiggle when ever they were supposed to under the skin like real animals. The skin was made with more detail and they basically up the anty a lot bigger than ever.Don't listen to me, don't listen to the people who hate this movie. Just go and see for yourself and make your own opinion.

It is jam-packed full of incredible special effects, great actors, imagination, humor, suspense - everything you could possibly ask for in a movie!The film did indeed have a plot ( which many people said there wasn't). There was a beginning, middle and an end. Jurassic Park /// portrayed how a group of people REALLY would survive on the island. We had heard all the science in the first two movies. Now is was on to the action.First of all, the dinosaurs. Industrial Light & Magic did a phenomenal job on the special effects. The scene where a Pteranodon grabs Billy in the water was simply perfect, just like the rest of the movie. It was nice to see the dinosaurs reacting more with their environment this time around. E.g. moving bushes, eating grass, splashing water. Stan Winston also excelled himself. The mixture of CGI and live action was nothing short of perfect. It was nice to see the dinosaurs portrayed as animals rather than pure killing machines like in The Lost World. The Spinosaurus was a nice change from the T-Rex. After all. T-Rex had been the main star of every dinosaur movie since movies began. Not very 21st Century is it?The actors. Sam Neill really made his presence felt in this movie. He was his same old loving self from the first Jurassic Park. That was needed in this movie. Tea Leoni did a fine job acting Amanda - a much better improvement than Julianne Moore (Sarah Harding in The Lost World) who did not stop talking throughout the entire movie. The way Tea acted when coming face-to-face with a Velociraptor was spine-tingling. She was so scared. William H. Macy also acted his role well, as did Alessandro Nivola and Trevor Morgan. Laura Dern also made a very nice appearance.The script. Even though it was written as they filmed the movie, the script proved to be a success and had many memorable quotes. Alan's speech about Astronomers & Astronauts was by far the best piece of writing I have seen in a film in a long time.The ending was short but nevertheless good. The Pteranodons flying in the clouds was a perfect way to end a perfect movie. At last we saw something believable, unlike the San Diego scene in The Lost World. The main Jurassic Park theme was enchanting and enough to bring a tear to the eye. The original feeling of the original Jurassic Park came flowing back. Joe Johnson captured the Jurassic mood with his brilliant directing as did Don Davis with the score.As a conclusion, this movie does not deserve the bad comments it gets.  It is a true Jurassic Park. I recommend this movie to anyone. Buy the DVD or VHS now!

Spielberg had left the project (except for his role as producer), and the film was reportedly a mere 90 minutes long, but for some reason, I still held high hopes for this Joe Johnston-directed dino-flick.  Fortunately, the dissapointment of the second film was immidiately washed away by the high-octane thrill ride that is the third installment of this once-again-great franchise.  People have complained of a weak story and cheesy dialogue, but honestly, what do these people expect?  For a movie of its kind, the dialogue is actually both intelligent and humurous, and the story, though by no means original, is still exciting and attention-keeping. The performances are all decent to great, with talentless Tea Leoni giving probably her best (though still mediocre) performance of her career.  Macy and Niell both shine in there roles, each one utilizing a subdued and natural style that works well with the loose and exciting pace of the film. The new major new dino-the Spinosaurus egypticus is a great replacement for the T-rex, and it provides some of the films scariest and most thrilling moments.  The pteranadons, which are thankfully not referred to a dinosaurs, are also a great new addition, as the scene with them is probably the most tense and terrifying of the film.  Overall, a great followup after the dissapointing second film, which makes me happy to once again think of this franchise as on of the greatest ever.  Bring on #4!

The special effects in Jurassic Park III don't disappoint either. It's amazing what can be done when it comes to bringing these dinosaurs to life.

Anyway...on with JP3...JP3 was a great movie!  First of all, the special effects are incredible!!!  There are some scenes that put my jaw on the floor because the dino looked sooo real.  As far as story goes, this film is nothing terribly complicated, but that is just fine with me.  I went into the movie to see some dinos, and I got just that.  I think I liked the story because it's simple, but feasible (given that Jurassic Park exists)!  Also, it doesn't throw in a bunch of useless, lame sub-plot points (like the girl in JP2 being a gymnast).  I would agree that the movie was a bit short, but that wasn't anything I couldn't deal with, it was a short and sweet movie.  The acting was fine as far as I could tell, I didn't have any problems with it.  One thing you have to keep in mind is that these actors are acting with nothing in the shot, or if there is something to act against, it isn't anything mildly intimidating.  I give all the actors props for being able to make it believable.  I noticed that some people on this site said that they thought the ending was horrible, I disagree, I thought it was fine.All in all, I'd have to say that if you like both of the other JP films then it's probably safe to say you'll like this one.  But if you didn't like one or the other, you may be disappointed.  I'll leave you with this, don't go into the theater expecting a thought-provoking, deep movie, just sit back and be entertained.  Also, appreciate the dinosaurs, a lot of people put a lot of effort into making the dinos look that good, so give them some credit.

So interested people go and see the island from the outside and do not go in it (duh!). It's bad enough already being a paleontologist, but because now that everyone knows there are living dinosaurs it becomes harder for paleontogists (like Dr.Grant) to get any funds. Which makes sense why he took the Kirby's offer (anyways Grant thought they were just gonna fly over it). It's a good little story, but it makes sense. Some people just can't think or are unable to fully analyze films. The only flaw I see in this film is when they said Eric Kirby was on the island for 8 weeks (unbelievable).

Spooky atmosphere, great dinosaur effects, and a rather simple, yet involving story all draw you in. The movie is indeed short, yet too much film can be just that. Any longer and the movie would've outgrown what it is, a thrill ride from start to finish. Joe Johnston, who did great work with Jumanji, really takes the movie and runs with it, and one really has to admire the filmmaking. In a world of movie cliches (which the end thankfully doesn't cave into) and drawn out action films trying to be something they aren't, Johnston has trimmed the fat, making JP3 a action-packed machine of a summer popcorn movie, and a movie that leaves you begging for more.

Unsurprisingly, Spielberg has ditched the franchise and passed the leash of it onto Joe Johnston who directed the uninspiring 'Jumanji.' Was this a good decision? Let's find out.OK so we haven't got off to the best start, a director who doesn't exactly have excellent film history really doesn't help things, however, in comparison to some of this years blockbusters, it is just about average. Jurassic Park 3 throws up a few surprises which is its saving grace.A nice touch is the return of Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, being a supremely popular character in the first film, it was practically inevitable for her return, though her character is a little scarce on the ground for our liking. Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant makes a predictable reappearance.The story is adequate to keep audiences sustained through an exceptionally short running time of just 83 minutes. The words too short spring to mind even before watching the film, and this is even more evident at the finale.A short, but well shot introduction gives us an insight into the separate characters lives as well as providing the basis for the whole film itself. This is a clear-cut no nonsense action movie, all well and good but it means the movie lacks the witty, humorous dialogue that made the previous two films so different and enjoyable, that's not to say Jurassic Park 3 doesn't have it moments, but they are scarce.William H Macy and Tea Leoni star beside Sam Neill and Alessandro Nivola along with an array of other forgettable characters that one by one are picked off by the dinos. The acting is adequate rather than inspired but all the characters give likable performances, especially Nivola who plays his character with a much needed cautious approach and provides us with some of the movies most hair-raising and enjoyable moments.Casting is one of the fundamental flaws in this film, Leoni is simply not right for this type of movie and her clumsy character only makes the films serious feel deteriorate as it progresses, she struggles to keep up pace with the other actors. It is a shame she is not picked off as lunch. Sam Neill provides us with a very watered down Alan Grant and his performance is severely lacking for a lead role.When people think of Jurassic Park, they think of excellent special effects; this is true to an extent, the CGI remains unrivalled but the animatronics feel very much like leftovers and lack the realistic movements of their predecessors. Jurassic Park fans are going to be disappointed.From the director of 'Jumanji', a childish storyline is expected, so this is not such a concern, but even so, some of the decisions the adults make are ridiculous, leaving us most definitely; rooting for the dinosaurs. Jurassic Park 3 does have some excellent and very memorable scenes however, the giant bird cage is exceptionally entertaining and brings back the Jurassic Park feel to the film. The finale is good, but a little short, though this is just a minor consideration that doesn't need to be taken into account.The saving grace of this film is the story's unpredictability, keeping the audience guessing right until the very end. It may be a little thin on the ground, but it is unpredictable nevertheless. Jurassic Park 3 is a good way to pass the time, but not a strong film on any basis. It lacks the story and in depth characters of the previous two films and will also leave audiences feeling short changed. One can only wonder how great this film could've been if Steven Spielberg had returned to the helm of this franchise. An efficient but soulless film.It just has about enough meat to get your teeth stuck into and enough to keep the franchise going a little longer. JP 4? Yes please, but only if Steven Spielberg is directing.

The story and setting, plus the mention of San Diego, make it an obvious follow up to 1997's The Lost World, though Jeff Goldblum does not return, Sam Neil does, as fan favorite Alan Grant. The movie was met with considerable hype due to the return of two memorable characters from the original film, one being Alan Grant, and the other being Ellie Settler. To me this film always seemed far too rushed for a Jurassic Park movie, the beginning of this film is the better part, and could have been way longer. Instead the whole point of this movie is to make Sam Neil return to the island. Along with him are a husband and wife who are named the Kirby's, played by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni who are searching for their son after he vanished in the area while on a holiday trip with his unbiological father. Why they were even there to begin with, seeing it's restricted is unclear and stupid. The character Kirby played by William H. Macy is quite funny, likable and overall a good asset to this film. The main antagonist is not the T-Rex anymore and is instead replaced by the Spinosaur, which I don't mind at all but the 25 second battle between the two in this movie is shocking. The T-Rex gets its neck snapped! That's how our child-hood hero goes out, great! The movie tries to stick faithful to the original by using animatronics for the dinosaurs, but here they just looked more like machines than animals, the way their heads jerked so suddenly just revealed how poor the hydraulics for this films movie magic was. Sam Neil as Alan Grant is very poor in his role the second time round, he just looks bored and there's nothing he does in this movie that's memorable, the same can be said about the movie itself. At 90 minutes long what can a movie even do!? Seriously, it just flashes by, the other sequels all go for over 2 hours, which means there was obviously something in them that was needed to be shown, but here the only reason is to make money. Alan Grant returning is great but why ruin his character, along with Ellie Settler, they aren't even a couple in this film. The CGI somehow looks even worse than it did in the original and overall this movie just fails as being something Jurassic Park related. Watching all four of these films is unnecessary, skip this one, nothing here is important, it's just a formula for making money which the makers obviously knew. Stamping Sam Neil's name on this movie is what got everyone pumped for, and I don't think it was fair for him to leave this franchise on such a poor note... The only redeeming factor in this film has to be some of William H. Macy's acting, and maybe some of the action scenes with the Pteordactyles... Other than that, a very disappointing sequel with no wow factor and a disgrace to Sam Neil's beloved character.

This third installment has some fine performers in it -- Bill Macy, Sam Neill, Tea Leoni, Laura Dern -- but that's it for the good stuff. They must have received splendid checks.The original Jurassic Park had a lot of bang for the buck. Just for example, that leisurely sequence in which a cartoon character teaches us dummies about DNA and how to extract it from a mosquito and all that. It followed the classical structure of King Kong. There might be a crisis followed by a temporary resolution. Then another crisis and resolution, but of greater importance. Then another, and so on, until you have King Kong wrecking half of New York City or dinosaurs running loose in the staff cafeteria. Or a shark sinking a fishing boat, to cite another example of the classic narrative structure.Nothing like that here. It's aimed, I suppose, at an audience that is impatient, unwilling to wait for the gradual build up, biting their tongues with the desire for immediate gratification during a suspenseful preamble.Nope. Here, an airplane crashes on an island full of man-eating dinosaurs in the first few minutes. The first human being is eaten after about fifteen minutes. Well -- actually, he's snapped up, chewed a little, then spit out into a mud puddle so he can try to crawl his way to freedom and be eaten again. A supersized meal.It's all noisy as hell, pounding music, screaming people, roaring monsters, crashing trees, smashing airplanes, horror galore, teeth the size of mastodon tusks, and none of the women disrobe.I'd call it a disappointment, only it's not. It's precisely what any sane devotee of the fast buck would produce -- a frantic ripoff of a modestly entertaining and financially successful earlier movie. It's practically an operational definition of decadence.Of course we've always had monster movies, before and after Universal's Frankenstein in 1931, but they usually had some kind of class. There weren't ALWAYS people getting ripped apart on the screen.I can't help wondering if this cheapening of an art, done at enormous expense, isn't resonating with public taste in some foul infinite loop. The more the kids see of this crap, the more simple-minded they want it to be. Hard-core pornography went through such a cycle. The original porn movies, like Deep Throat, had stories, however banal they may have been. But the producers of those gems quickly figured out that the narrative structure was too complicated, took too long, required some indulgence on the part of the viewers, so compilation porn movies evolved. No stories at all, just a handful of dreary episodes slapped together.Well, how about it? Why have a story in which Neil is hired as a guide to help Macy and Leoni find their lost child on the island? Why bother? Why not just have a series of episodes in which people we don't know or care about get eaten alive with a Wilhelm scream while grotesque monsters ululate behind them, in line sort of, waiting for their turn? In other words, the movie raises a genuine aesthetic question. How decadent can a thing be? Just exactly how low can public taste sink? Are its depths plumbless?

Tea Leoni and William H. Macy pull off a decent job too, although Alessandro Nivola (playing Billy) seems a little out of his depth at times. While Trevor Morgan gives Eric his all, fans of realism may baulk at how headstrong and unfazed he seems through it all, given his character's age of 12 and his long term stranding on the island. Unlike the first two films, director Joe Johnston adopts a much shorter running time of 93 minutes, bracing viewers for an all action experience. In some ways this works, as there are some truly breathtaking scenes involving the dinosaurs themselves. However, it prevents any sort of character progression, which was a very obvious and well-liked feature of the first two films. Similarly, stalwart fans of the original Jurassic Park won't appreciate Johnston's refusal to incorporate any sort of climax; instead, the action starts early and pretty much stays at the same pace, which may annoy viewers who like to be surprised and teased. That said, the effects involving the dinosaurs remain outstanding, and some of the many action scenes strongly rival the tension found in the first two films. The musical score is still strong, and the script, while nowhere near the strength of its predecessors, still convinces enough to hold its own.Jurassic Park 3 is by no means a BAD film. If you're a dino fan, or just want to see Sam Neill don the famous hat one last time, then go for it. It's just that in making the picture an all-action roller coaster, a lot of the depth found in the originals seems absent, and without that, the subtle touches that made them so magical also vanishes. It's arguably this that prevents Jurassic Park III from being as truly great as its bigger brothers were.

This fact is a house-hold term factor for Hollywood by now. Joe Johnson pieces together the best story they could manage and it gets the job done I guess.Sam Neil is dragged into this mediocre 90-minute tale, along with William H. Macy and Tea' Leoni. The comedy is off-beat and doesn't fit the film but enough of the bad. On the positive side, are dinosaurs are looking better than ever. It seems the color scheme has drastically altered; every dinosaur now is as bright as a tropical bird. I'm disappointed the Spinosaurus vs. T-Rex battle is set up at right at the beginning. The ending to me is kind of weak. IF anything that should've been the climatic end scene with the T-Rex taking victory. Probably the thing that lacked the most in this film. Don Davis does a decent score, but John Williams can never be topped.The trilogy factor will haunt movies forever&#x85; "},{"Title":"A disappointment to the Jurassic Park series","Date":"3 September 2001","Score":"2 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","Review":"  First of all I'd like to say that I am a huge, huge fan of the JP movies. The original is one of my all time favorite films. Second, I would like to say that, unlike many other people, I was not utterly disappointed with The Lost World. It was a fine movie, it just lacked something the first one had an abundance of. Anyway, when I first heard that a third Jurassic Park film was being made, I had my suspicions. I knew that film-makers like to cheap-out on the audience when they make a second sequel so my expectations weren't very high. When I saw the film, however, I was very surprised. Not surprised that it was better than I thought it would be, but surprised at the fact that it was considerably worse than my expectations. What made this movie so poor? Let me just say this although recently film-makers are trying to convince people otherwise, even if a movie has great special effects, story is still the most important part! The entire script to JP3 could have been written like thisYoung Boy OH No! I'm trapped on an island with dinosaurs! Help me! Parents of Young Boy Please save our son Dr. Grant. Dr. Grant Reluctantly, I will go with you. (They get to the island) Cast Oh No! Dinosaurs are coming! Let's run away! (They run away) Cast Oh No! More dinosaurs! We must run away again! (They run away) Cast Look, some more dinosaurs that we must run from! (They run away) (The End?)When the dinosaurs start over-shadowing the human actors, you know the movie isn't that good. Though I liked the introduction of new dinosaurs in the film, there weren't enough classic dinosaurs from the first one. The raptors were of no interest at all in this film and frankly, the one scene with the Tyranosaurus was an insult to giant carnovores everywhere. I was deeply angered and even saddened to see the king of the dinosaurs dethroned in such an embarrassing way. The one thing that sparked my interest about this film was that there was a fight between a spinosaurus and a T-rex. I sat in the theatre in anticipation for the big duel between these prehistoric heavyweights. What I witnessed was a short little skirmish that ended with the T-rex getting killed off before the humans even get a chance to run from him. If the makers of this film wanted to make a fight that would last in our memories they should have made a lengthy and elaborate one that would have made a great finale. In my opinion, a battle between two seven ton titans would have been a much better climax than the insult of an ending that was given to us.Well, that about wraps up my review. If you want to see a good dinosaur movie, see the original Jurassic Park. Avoid this one at all costs.

This film is strictly by the numbers, but it all appears to go too fast-it only lasted 90 minutes! While I love the beauty of nature, it is hard to enjoy this film, where the characters just run around pointlessly. It has none of the magic of the first two. It jumps into the action to fast, with the viewer not having time to absorb it all. It really is one big scene, with them just running around for the whole movie. It ends ridiculously, and it is SO predictable. Really awful, and the raptors even talk to each other! Well, lets hope there will never be a jp4!

Follows the scifi tradition of robots that are able to both evolve and replicate more intelligent editions to battle humans. In this case, the robots have evolved a superkiller to protect the island, knowing that humans will return soon. They can talk of course. But the fliers disagree and decide on a run and proliferate strategy.Standing orders are to kill the men and save the women and children for experiments, and always to defer the killing to the big guys if possible. But one of the intruders steals some eggs, the greatest taboo. Makes it necessary for the spino to kill a few small dinos just to keep order, but the rebellion grows.The fliers do get involved in an undisciplined way, and they are exiled to another island. The smaller raptors who are keepers of the eggs do confront the intruders and get the eggs back. Wheels turn and the lack of discipline (plus some gasoline) allow the bad guys to barely escape. Then the good guys have them, then the bad guys show up with all their machines of destruction.We are led to believe that the dino robot population kill the spinos and devise a new, more powerful protection for the next episode combination dino/war machines.

Basically tourists Ben Hildebrand (Mark Harelik) and Eric Kirby (Mean Creek's Trevor Morgan) are parasailing around the island of Isla Sorna, where the dinosaurs where engineered and nurtured for Jurassic Park, the boat pulling them is attacked by an unseen creature, killing the crew, and Ben is forced to uncouple the line before the boat crashes, he and Eric with him go sailing into the wilderness. Paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) has become famous as a result of writing a book about his experiences on Jurassic Park (Dr. Ian Malcolm also wrote a book which is mentioned later), while his friend Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is married to Mark Degler (Taylor Nichols) with two children. Alan discusses with Ellie how raptors are more intelligent than they previously believed, he also discusses his theories at an auditorium lecture, but the audience only want to ask him about Jurassic Park, or the incident in San Diego, but later at his dig site his assistant Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) demonstrates a replicant of the larynx of a Velociraptor, made with 3D printer. Alan is next met by Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) who invites him to dinner with his wife Amanda (Téa Leoni), the offer him funding for his research if he will guide them on an aerial tour over Isla Sorna, to see the dinosaurs in their natural environment, he reluctantly agrees, joined by Billy, and the Kirbys' mercenary associates, Udesky (Michael Jeter), Cooper (John Diehl) and pilot M.B. Nash (Bruce A. Young). On the plane Alan hears the Kirbys' real intention to land on the island, his knocked out when opposing and wakes to Amanda using a bullhorn to call out to someone, this attracts a Spinosaurus to attack and kill Cooper and Nash and destroy the plane, the fleeing survivors briefly lose the dinosaur, only to encounter a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Spinosaurus returns and the two carnivores fight, with the Spinosaurus killing the T. Rex, the group escape into the jungle. The Kirbys explain that they are on the island to find their missing son Erik and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, Paul and Amanda are divorced, exploring the island they find the parasail entangled in the trees, Ben's decomposed body is attached to it, they also come across a nest of raptor eggs, they take the parasail with them. The group next find an abandoned InGen compound, soon they encounter a Velociraptor, during the ambush it calls out to its pack, the group flee into a herd of Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, causing a stampede, Alan retrieves Billy's dropped satchel, while Udesky is wounded by the raptors, Amanda, Paul and Billy try to help him, but they realise the raptors had set a trap for them, one of them finally kills Udesky. Alan watching them suspects the Velociraptors are searching for something, they ambush and corner him, but is rescued by Eric, he has been surviving the eight weeks he has been missing in an overturned supply truck, the next day the two of them are reunited with Paul, Amanda and Billy. They survive another encounter with the Spinosaurus, then Alan discovers that Billy has stolen two raptor eggs, hidden in his satchel, this provoked the raptor attacks, Billy thought they would be worth a fortune to fund their research, Alan decides to keep them to ensure the group's survival. In the facility the enter they climb down the stairs into a foggy caged area, it is only when the fog clears they realise they are in an aviary, used to house Pteranodons, which attack the group, Eric is rescued by Billy using Ben's parasail, but he is attacked and apparently killed by the Pteranodons, the rest of the group escape the large bird cage, leaving the door unlocked in panic, in a small boat they make their way downriver, heading to the coast. At night, Alan tries to contact Ellie on the satellite phone, but the Spinosaurus attacks the boat, Alan is only able to say the words The River! Site B before being forced into the water, Alan and Paul scare it away setting leaked fuel on fire. The next day the group are close to the coast, but are ambushed by the pack of Velociraptors, Alan has Amanda hand back the eggs, while he uses the 3D-printed raptor larynx to confuse the pack, they run off with the eggs. In the end the group reach the coast where the the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps are waiting, called by Ellie, on a helicopter they discover Billy is seriously injured but alive, as they leave they see Pteranodons flying free, Alan guesses they are looking for new nesting grounds. Also starring Taylor Nichols as Mark Degler, Julio Oscar Mechoso as Enrique Cardoso, Blake Michael Bryan as Charlie, Sarah Danielle Goldberg as Cheryl Logan and Linda Park as Hannah. Neill is still likable as the intelligent guide, Leoni could have been on longer, and supporting stars Macy, Leoni, Nivola and Jeter do their parts fine, but as with the other two films before, the dinosaurs brought to life by the fantastic CGI special effects and models are the real stars, including newly evolved or whatever Spinosaurus Eegyptiacus which seems more dangerous and aggressive than the good old T. Rex, it may be same old same old most the way through, and the ending a little dashed off, but you can't help but get into the action, especially the pterodactyl attack scene, an entertaining science- fiction adventure. Good!

It`s not the worst blockbuster film I`ve seen but it has committed the sin of becoming a franchise film . It does deserve some brownie points of having humourous scenes like the dream sequence of a talking dinosaur , but the plot of Dr Grant being coaxed back to Dinosaur Island where a group of humans attempt to survive against flesh eating prehistoric monsters is something I`ve seen perhaps a little too often . It is a mildly entertaining film but after seeing THE MATRIX and THE LORD OF THE RINGS audiences have rightly come to demand something a bit more from a Hollywood blockbuster  "}]
