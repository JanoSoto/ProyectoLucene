Why? It's hard to say exactly. Sure, the acting is great and the story is terrific, but what makes Tampopo so special is harder to define. I like to think of it as optimism; the belief that people in this world still do nice things for other people. Or maybe that romance can strike when you least expect it. Sure, this is a movie about food, you've heard all about that, but more importantly it's a movie about people. People working together, eating together, striving together, and accomplishing together.The script is flawless. Every scene blends into the next, and takes you someplace new. The narrative sidetracks away from the main story from time to time, leading to the most conceptual and entertining scenes. Tampopo is an adventure on a very small and personal scale. It's a charming movie, unlike any other I've seen, well worth a look.

This is one of those rare movies that are made with so much emotion, you can't help but be affected by what's going on before your eyes. I found the movie to be funny, touching, shocking, sensual, weird, thoughtful, cute, etc. The love of food is apparent throughout the entire movie. It kind of reminded me of Like Water for Chocolate, the way food was revered in the story. The movie is done in an interesting way. Mainly, it's about a woman named Tampopo who is left in charge of her husband's noodle shop after he dies. Having problems with maintaining a general quality to the place, especially with the cooking, she receives assistance from a rugged cowboy-type. Along with several other characters, they help to turn the place into something special. Occasionally, the story veers away from this plot to follow other characters in food-related scenes. For instance, there's a vignette about a group of girls being taught how to eat noodle soup properly by an etiquette teacher at a restaurant. They notice another patron in the restaurant, sucking at his noodles loudly but clearly enjoying them. The girls then do the same thing, prompting the teacher to follow suit, all of them sucking away at their noodles with the most exaggerated sound effects I have ever heard. This results in a scene so hilarious that I had to stop it and rewind it after it was done. Soon after, the story goes back to Tampopo and the other characters in her universe. There's other characters that are returned to periodically, like this white-suited gangster and his moll. Their scenes are erotically charged and quite striking. It was funny but at the same time it just grabbed me attention wise. There's a moment where they pass a raw egg yolk back and forth through each others mouths without rupturing it. It's done slowly and erotically, the two lovers obviously enjoying this really weird thing we're seeing. I have to say I've never really seen anything like that in a movie. All in all, I was pretty much entranced from the moment the movie began. I really didn't think I was going to enjoy it this much! It's really funny and it shows a side to Japanese cuisine and how serious it is taken there that I had never known before viewing this. I recommend this movie from top to bottom and I think it has deservedly earned a spot in my all-time faves list! If you are interested in Japanese culture and you appreciate food in the least, you owe it to yourself to track a copy of this down and watch it, especially if you like a good bowl of ramen!

But anyone who gives it a willing and open mind will find a deep respect within drawing them further into the movie. Should the simple viewer happen upon this movie, it is necessary to understand that it is not an American movie and only slightly emulates one, therefore it must be expected that certain aspects of the film will escape one at first. There will be certain chapters of the film which appeal more than others, but it is crucial to make an effort to be considerate of the fact that Juzo Itami was not necessarily making Tampopo up to be an international success. What is truly mindblowing is that this movie is nearly twenty years old! I am completely in awe each time I see this movie, and it never fails to make me stop and watch as Goro is instructing Tampopo on why the customer must, MUST, be observed upon entering the shop while Gun complains that the pork slices are too thin.

Slurp!","Date":"6 October 2002","Score":"17 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" There are any number of very funny scenes in this lightly plotted and highly episodic romantic comedy from acclaimed Japanese director Juzo Itami. You may recall him as the guy who got in trouble with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia, because they didn't like the way he made fun of them in Minbo no onna (1992). You may also know that he committed suicide at the age of 64 in 1997 after being accused of adultery. He is the son of samurai film maker Mansaku Itami. I mention this since one of the things satirized here are samurai films.But--and perhaps this is the secret of Itami's success both in Japan and elsewhere--the satire is done with a light, almost loving touch. Even though he also takes dead aim at spaghetti westerns and the Japanese love affair with food, especially their predilection for fast food noodle soup, at no time is there any rancor or ugliness in his treatment.If you've seen any Itami film you will be familiar with his star, his widow, Nobuko Miyamoto, she of the very expressive face, who is perhaps best known for her role as the spirited tax collector in Itami's The Taxing Woman (1987) and The Taxing Woman Returns (1988). She has appeared in all of his films. Here she is Tampopo (Dandelion), a not entirely successful proprietor of a noodle restaurant. Along comes not Jones but Tsutmu Yamazaki as Goro, a kind of true grit, but big-hearted Japanese urban cowboy. He ambles up to the noodle bar and before long establishes himself as a kind of John Wayne hero intent on teaching Tampopo how the good stuff is made. Along the way Itami makes fun of stuffy bureaucrats, macho Japanese males, heroic death scenes, Japanese princesses attempting to acquire a European eating style, movie fight scenes, and God knows what else.The comedy is bizarre at times. The sexual exchange of an egg yoke between the man in the white suit (Koji Yakusho) and his mistress (Fukumi Kuroda) might make you laugh or it might just gross you out. The enthusiastic description of the yam sausages from inside a wild boar is strange. Surely one is not salivating at such an entre, but one can imagine that such a delicacy might surely exist and have its devotees.Indeed an Itami film has a kind of logic all its own. An exemplary scene is that of the stressed and dying mother of two young children, who is ordered by her husband to Get up and cook! This (reasonably relevant) scene is juxtaposed with the one with the college professor which is about being and getting ripped off--which seems to have little to do with the rest of the movie, yet somehow seems appropriate, perhaps only because they are at a restaurant. Another typical Itami scene is the businessmen at supper. They hem and haw until their chief orders and then they all pretend to debate and consider, and then order exactly the same thing except for one brash young guy who dazzles (and embarrasses) the old sycophantic guys by order a massive meal in French with all the trimmings.The climax of the film comes with plenty of musical fanfare. As Goro and others sit down at the counter, they are served Tampopo's final culinary creation, the noodle soup now hopefully honed to perfection. As the tension mounts, a musical accompaniment, reminiscent of something like the clock ticking in High Noon (1952), rises to a crescendo. All the while Tampopo sweats and frets and prays that she will triumph, which will be in evidence if, and only if, they drain their soup bowls! (Do they?)The final credits roll (after some further misdirections and some further burlesque) over a most endearing and ultimately touching shot of a young mother with a beautiful and contented infant feeding at her breast.Perhaps this was Itami's best film.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

It is hard to define this film as anything but a story of life through culinary perspective. Major aspects of our every day experience are looked at by introducing food into them, sometimes resulting in a very comical effect. From the first scene, to the last few moments, you will probably be amazed by sheer originality of this movie. Simply coming up with ideas they came up with takes a unique and incredibly approach. Something that has never been done before.In a sense, I can only compare Tampopo's approach at making us 'taste' what we see with a 2006 film Perfume which managed to describe olfactory experiences with as much success. But unlike Perfume, Tampopo also juggles around few other interesting movie genres just for the fun of it. If you watch carefully, you will begin to see western elements, gangster movie and even a police crime, all in one movie. They might not seem connected at first, but they will make sense in due time.Overall however the side stories are only there to keep us interested in the main event. If you thought that tasting things in cinema is impossible, wait till you see Tampopo.10/10 for great cast, humour, story and acting. "},{"Title":"Once upon a time, not long ago.

One article said that it would be easy to introduce the rice into Eastern cultures, because of the way the traditional Eastern cultures viewed food as a sacred thing, especially rice. I seem to remember that certain rices, usually based on the color, were reserved for different things. I think dark rice was served during ceremonies or as a signal of an upperclass status. But the point was, that certain cultures view food as such a holy, sacred thing that other cultures may not.That's what Tampopo is all about, the beauty of food. Kind of reminds me of Cibbo Motto's first album, Vive La Woman where ever song is about food. In Tampopo, we may start with Tampopo's painstaking quest to be the best noodlemaker, but eventually, we get little strings of skit-like stories interspersed throughout the picture showing the different ways food is valued. In the beginning, for example, the film opens up in with a couple in a theater, and the man in the white suit talking about how he didn't like to be disturbed by the sounds of crinkling bags of potato chips and other assorted theater food. Meanwhile, he and his date are being served quite a fine feast (considering they're only in a theater) when they arrive at the theater. Something unusual for me as well funny, and as you will see in the rest of the movie, something completely different. You may never look at food the same again.The main story is that of Tampopo, a noodlemaker at Lai Lai. One night a visitor, Goro, stops in her restaurant and gives her advice about the quality of her soup. In sort of a parody of Rocky, Goro trains her to be the best noodlemaker in a way that the Lai Lai into a temple of noodles. She starts to meet people along the way who are noodle masters themselves who will train her how to take care into each noodle and so forth. So precise and everything else. As the story continues, we see a master and his trainee learning how to eat a bowl of soup. The rituals, the caressing of the meat with the chopsticks, and all of that. We see the couple who place a sensuous value upon food, using it somewhat as a substitute for actual sex. We see a man who's wife is on her deathbed, but manages the strength to get up and cook rice for the family before dying. We see a series of homeless vagrants who tell Tampopo about all the exciting foods and beverages they've been working on. They describe brilliant French cuisines and one man even notes that he's worked fifteen years on perfecting a type of sake. In another part of the film, we briefly see some Japanese businessmen in a restaurant. All order sole except for one, who I think is something like an intern-type, who goes through great effort describing the meal he wishes to order and what it is made of, even the beverage. I think this movie is pretty funny for us American audiences because the idea seems so stupid everyone is so serious about food. Asian cultures may look at this differently, and find it funny because of things the characters say (like the dentists who remove a man's absess in his tooth and have to run to the window because it smelled so bad), knowing that they too, hold food in the same value. It's really remarkable the context that the film can be taken simply because of an unusual subject food. This movie shows how nearly every facet of life revolves around food.Don't watch it on an empty stomach.

This film is without a doubt one of the most sensual, generous masterly realized movie of all times. It is to be hold close to Fritz Lang and Kubrik masterpieces, but obviously in a completely different register. It would take me all night to decipher the various reasons why this pure marvel is so good. But this is not required. It is simply a tale about life and death, and the ongoing process of sex and food in between the two. Epicurism was never thought to be a Japanese value, until we Westerners with all our believes and convictions, realized that Japanese culture encompasses much more that our restrained field of philosophy. This ode to life touches all aspects of our arrogant human society in so many FUNNY and touching ways that I could hardly compare it to anything else watched anywhere else. In a way it is an encyclopedia of human traits. Maybe La Grande Bouffe would be the closest contender on SOME aspects only. But Tampopo goes much further in my opinion.

It is an excellent example of the ability of the Japanese to laugh at themselves, at those things that are peculiarly Japanese, and at their love affair with western (and particularly American) culture.The Japanese have long had a tremendous admiration for the nerve and individuality of the Americans.  They admire those traits mostly because they are all but forbidden in Japanese society.

Well, if there can be spaghetti and sauerkraut westerns, why can't there be noodle westerns? Tampopo isn't an eastern western like Red Sun but instead a contemporary comedy spoofing a trope of the genre; it's about a truck driver Goro (Bull) who drives a truck with bull horns and along his way helps a widow called Tampopo (Dandelion) to renovate her noodle restaurant. In the end, he drives off into the unknown right after uttering See you, partner.Of course, that story is just there to overwrap countless other short segments which deal with the significance of food in people's lives, linking it with sex, crime, family life and death. The short segments unfold naturally, sort of following the main storyline, which then takes over, usually with screen wipes and iris transitions. The movie ends with a long shot of a baby being breastfed - a new life begins, and starts craving food immediately. The movie has a pretty fetishistic approach towards food; not only does it insist on showing us hunger-inducing close-ups of noodles, but some of the short stories usually deal with food in a sexualized manner. For example, the old woman with a food squeezing fetish, the eating etiquette class for women referencing frigidity, or any scene with the gangster in a white suit. After opening the movie by breaking the fourth wall, he is seen licking salt, lemon juice and whipped cream off his girlfriend's nipples, and then proceeds to prepare a prawn meal with her stomach and to exchange a kiss with her using an egg yolk. Later he eats an ostrich out from a teenage pearl diver's hand and makes out with her. After getting shot, he, in his dying breath, conveys a secret sausage recipe to his girlfriend. There's also a scene where a dying mother cooks one last meal for her family (ending with a shot of a speeding train, to highlight her passing). Food as a ritual, as a culture barrier and as a way of life, is obviously the primary motif in Tampopo.Like many other Juzo Itami films, this one is a satire as well, not only because there's a lot of hidden side-jokes regarding culture, but also because it takes a traditional male job, a ramen cook, and inverts the tradition by making the cook a female (Tampopo). One last thing the movie is known for is the controversial killing of a live turtle for a meal. However, at least it was eaten by the crew, which is more than you can say for other films that feature animal abuse.Tampopo was sort of re-imagined in 2008 as The Ramen Girl, but even though I haven't seen that one, I can't imagine it getting as close to the original's feel and atmosphere. I love the unconventional storytelling in Tampopo, the well-timed pacing and, most of all, the short side stories. It's the reason why dozens of noodle restaurants around the world are named Tampopo and the reason why Itami became known in the first place.

The main narrative follows two truck drivers, Gun (Yamazaki Tsutomu) and Goro (Watanabe Ken) who stumble upon a run down, unpopular ramen noodle shop. The shop's owner, Tampopo (Miyamoto Nobuko), is running it all by herself and isn't too experienced in the art of making good ramen. After a brawl, Gun and Goro take it upon themselves to improve Tampopo's cooking and redefine her shop. The film not only focuses on this narrative, but is interspersed with brilliantly transitioned scenes of people's interaction with food a white-suited yakuza (Yakusho Koji) and his mistress perform erotic acts with food, a group of homeless turn out to be master chefs, a young corporate subordinate upstages all of his superiors with his knowledge of French cuisine at an expensive dinner, an old lady sneaks around in a supermarket just to feel the food, among others.Never missing a step, Yamazaki Tsutomu fully embodies the character of Gun. His tough assertiveness, along with the willingness to fight and instigate others, gives him many of the characteristics that John Wayne's famous cowboy persona's had. In fact, the entire cast is filled with likable, charismatic characters. Tampopo is spunky, determined, and easy to root for&#x96;we want her to succeed in her quest for ramen- making perfection. Yakusho Koji is also a welcome presence with his depiction of the erotic possibilities of food; in one scene he cracks an egg and the yolk is passed around between his mouth and his beautiful mistress's. It is ultimately the way in which these characters are portrayed on screen that gives them such a likable presence. Food is universally loved&#x96;showing characters and their intense passion for food strikes a chord with everybody. It also makes you hungry.Itami's use of scene transitions is brilliant in its unobtrusiveness. Scenes suddenly shift without the viewer even noticing&#x96;it's seamless perfection. For example, there is a scene in which Tampopo is exercising outside under Gun's supervision when a group of businessmen in suits walks past. The camera decides to follow the businessmen to their destination, a French restaurant, to watch them order their food, then follows the waiter out into the main seating area where it stops to observe a group of women receiving a lesson on proper Western dining etiquette (eating without slurping&#x85;although a Western man in the restaurant is slurping his noodles loudly, much to the chagrin of the teacher). As the businessmen's waiter passes through, the camera follows him back to the business party. You can't help but enjoy the way this all works&#x96;the transitions make for a creative and ultimately successful approach to telling a story with multiple plot lines and random happenings.Itami created a masterpiece here, one that should be seen and loved by everyone. There are not many films that display the kind of warm splendor that Tampopo emanates. You cannot avoid smiling throughout the movie. The characters become deeply involving and one cannot help but feel connected with them. This is the ultimate film for food lovers. Try to avoid the pangs hunger while watching. I couldn't.

It goes through many genres, not the least of which include Gangster, Samurai, and getting even more interesting... erotica. Also there are quick quips at melodrama and others.Secondly, westerns have systemic narrative structure, and this film breaks down most narrative structure within the first five minutes in a sort of post-modern self-recipricality.

Itami does not seek to expose and ridicule, but sprinkles loving touches throughout the story of a widow's struggling noodle business. In an early scene, Goro recounts how his master taught him the mysteries and treasures of the ramen bowl, and how he delicately assigns each segment its own personality; each slice of pork, each strand of noodle (smooth but strong!), the slowly sinking seaweed. Such an ode to a simple staple meal could be inserted in many films about food, and Itami only slightly exaggerates. And it's effective too - films about food should make you hungry, and imbue you with the same sense of passion for cooking as the characters do. I made noodles immediately after watching this.

A lone wanderer (he has a young Ken Watanabe in tow, who does not do much) drifts into a bar on a rainy night and quietly threatens a drunk scoundrel, before being beaten soundly offscreen by 5 men (they later have a 'rematch' which ends in them congratulating on each other's prowess). Later, in a voyeuristic and mysterious moment heightened by the soundtrack, Tampopo is lead by a stranger through back alleys and grimy shops to a slit in the wall, which reveals not a secret conspiracy or cult, but a man preparing soup stock. When a rival restaurant is challenged, the stride into the scene fanned out like a posse from a western, looking for retribution. In the climatic shoot-out, the banging drums once again make this tenser than a meal could ever be, and the camera slides slowly across each taster (and here the sound design is just both incredible and funny - not horses galloping, gunshots or an iconic whistle, but slurping, slurping and more slurping), before the music crescendos with them downing the soup in unison. And after the whole affair, Goro wanders away to yet another story, like a Blondie or an Ethan Edwards. Tampopo remains earnest herself, Miyamoto giving a delightful performance. There is much played straight in the narrative of revitalising the noodle joint; lessons in dissecting each facet of the customer's body language, needs and personality, timing the preparation of each bowl and memorising orders to a tee could fit snugly into a similar movie as a training montage. In one particularly shining moment, she echoes the biting criticisms of a rival's noodles and all she has learned while bobbing in and out and behind Goro, all with the adorable creased smile on her face. She reacts to failure with teary disappointment, and to success with delight and dedication. It is in fact the aspect of playing it straight that creates much of the comedy. Food is taken very seriously, even by the homeless, who compare fine wines like they were at the dinner table, not crouching in a rubbish dump. And like true food snobs, they lament about declines in product quality and the departure of the human touch, but that is complimented by the loving way in which a rice omelette is delicately fried; maybe they do know a thing or too. They, like Tampopo, talk of food with wide eyes and sly smiles, and are completely and utterly earnest.We see the same in the little vignettes sprinkled throughout the main story, and it creates an outrageous and absurd humour. A young man sees his older colleagues all order rather plain meals, and then inquires at length about the fine cuisines on the menu, and then keeps going and going, all while he is being prodded to hurry up. Weeping children are told to finish every last bite of their meal, just like at any dinner table, only this one is cooked by the dead wife. The silence of a posh socialite lesson is invaded by the slurping of a man nearby, and then to the horror of the elder, the attempts by her students begin to form a cacophony of slurps that only increase in volume and intensity! And then there is the sort of desire that approaches sensual levels, quite literally (First, caress the pork with your chopsticks). A slurp of an oyster (a strong vaginal symbol) turns into a heated sensual exchange, and the music makes it out to be some heavenly beauty and romance. And the main couple engage in a series of fetishized sexual acts involving a struggling shrimp shrimp against the bare belly, dipping body parts into cream, and something out of a drunk party game (I've seen it with ice), which involves slipping an egg yolk between each other's mouths. This is so so sincere, and their bodies shake with delight even as I shuddered in disgust. And at the end of their own little story, the gangster has been fatally shot, and his poetic final words turn into a long winded spiel about the yam sausages and the best garnishes to go with them. This is absolutely hilarious, because first Itami hits all the usual clichés (the shhh-ing of the weeping lover, the leaving of a memento, the reminiscing of a long bygone time), second because it goes on for far longer than these death scenes usually go on, faking out the audience several times, and finally because it is still treated as absolutely serious - I mean, listen to the music. And the final image is a perfect combination of the hedonistic urges that Tampopo is made up of - a baby eagerly sucking on a mother's breast. Even an infant knows what it wants.

It is moving, amusing and sad. Beyond its emotional content it has a philosophical depth which is not conceptually elaborated but which permeates it like the subtle flavour of a perfect noodle stock.The main characters are all fairly thoroughly rounded and battered by the abrasions of life. Without hiding their sadness, we see their joy in appreciating small achievements and subtle pleasures. There is a simple storyline but it's not the main point of the film. The real content is in the development of the characters and their interactions, and the subtly exaggerated comedy of the world view expressed in the film. There are numerous side-plots which range from extreme violence to hilarious eccentricity - a gangster is horribly murdered in front of his girlfriend; an elderly woman infuriates a shopkeeper by sneaking around the shop squeezing items of food.Tampopo is an absolute joy and offers a refreshingly original viewpoint on the possibilities of film making.

The story doesn't always follow this basic storyline which is kind of interesting but confusing as well at times. The movie is really about food and the way that the Japanese culture views it. They throw in mini-stories that revolve around food obsessions including a couple that begin the movie talking to us(the audience) and are shown at various times using food in their sexual encounters and their other normal activities of life and death. The main storyline starts with a couple of truck-driving noodle soup enthusiasts visiting a restaurant then helping the woman named Tampopo and becoming her coach. There is a sweetness in the relationships between her and her teachers, especially the main character that likes to wear a cowboy hat(which they use to spoof westerns a couple of times). The extra stories that the filmmakers throw in are a little more vulgar which makes for an interesting contrast of styles. The movie is funny and fun to watch for the most part and gives you a good idea of how the Japanese like their Ramen!!

From first frame to last, this magical movie transports you to a world that most humans have almost forgotten, where real feelings and sensations are the stuff of life. And death! All with food as the basic ingredient.The film revolves around the basic plot of the hero arriving to save the damsel in distress but frequently branches off to individual nuggets, pearls of wisdom, just plain weirdness, flights of fancy and pure hokum that would serve no purpose in any other setting but here serve to provide the most satisfying cinematic meal I can ever recall. No kidding.The references throughout the film mix a reverence of Japanese and European food culture, nods to the western film style and many other in and no-so-in jokes that sometimes only become clear after the third, fourth or fifth viewing. It's a keeper and you will come back to it - and for sure it a GREAT date movie, or just one to share with good friends. Oh, but it's no Disney flick. If I'm painting too rosy a picture, it should be noted that there are real tragic moments in this film too - the scene where a young mother dies just after cooking her last meal for the family and then the distraught father makes their even more distraught kids eat 'Mom's last meal while it's hot' lives long in the memory. There are also moments of bladder-loosening humour and I won't spoil the jokes by telling them here. It's a living film.Bound to appear on the favourites list of anyone who sees it. Such a shame that it has not had more exposure. I first encountered it on UK's channel 4 TV sometime around the late 80's.

The movie would be a breath of fresh air if all it did was constantly make you hungry, and make you laugh (it does both). On top of that, the fascination with food technique allows you to observe, say, a rice omelet being made before your eyes in about a minute, with a few skilled flips of a sauté pan. And the like. Perhaps best of all, the main plot is sidelined here and there to explore tangential events which meditate on the connection of food to sensuality, youthful folly, animals, teeth, family, friends, class, death, homelessness, etc. Piling another layer of astonishment to the abundance of conceits here, the entire thing references the standard John Wayne western, where a drifter comes into town, changes everything and just as quickly leaves.Tampopo is breath-taking! Rarely is a movie composed entirely of striking, unique, masterful, memorable scenes like this. I wish people who rave about schlock like 'Cinema Paradiso' would view this film. I wish people who were declaring the hyper-obvious There will be Blood a masterpiece, could see Tampopo so they'd understand what a movies potential is. The food vignettes are terrific comedy. This is just wonderful, whether you're poring over and deconstructing its many layers, or just sitting there, laughing hysterically.

How to make a rice omelet is included","Date":"15 February 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Tampopo has been compared to everything from a Shane-like Japanese western (loner comes riding into town and winds up helping, against the odds, a young widow with a little boy) to an episodic Tati-like film that uses gentle humor to show what a lot of us are like. In a way, it has the same sensibility as My Uncle...there's not a mean-spirited action or person in the movie, and we wind up liking the people we meet in the film. Like My Uncle, it doesn't have a Hollywood ending, but a conclusion which is both satisfying and poignant. Tampopo, however, is its own movie, not a derivation, and a fine movie it is, too. Goro (Tsutomu Yamaguchi) is a long-haul truck driver. With him is his young co-driver, Gun (Ken Watanabe). It's dark. It's raining and they're hungry so they pull over and stop at a small noodle shop. Inside are some rough characters, led by a drunk guy who is giving loud advice to the cook and owner. She, Tampopo (Nobuko Miyamoto), is behind the counter hustling steaming bowls of noodle soup. It's not long before Goro intervenes after telling Gun to go back to the truck. The next morning he's bruised, aching and wakes up in the noodle shop. And when Tampopo begs him and Gun over breakfast to honestly tell her what he thought of her soup, he does. It wasn't good, he says. Tampopo is determined to do better and begs Goro to stay and teach her. For the rest of the movie we're on a kind of surreal, metaphysical journey to learn how to make a masterful bowl of noodle soup. Along the way, we're going to encounter stories that have nothing to do with Tampopo and Goro, some stories that have a glancing relationship to them, and some that are very much part of their story...and the stories all are humorously odd, a bit off-center, and funny. We even have two death scenes, one so over the top as to be awe-inspiring (Note to self Decline any offer to eat grilled wild boar yam sausage). The thing they all have in common is food...an old woman lasciviously squeezing the fruit and cheese in a modern supermarket...an awkward salaryman at a private luncheon with the elderly bosses, none of whom can manage the French menu and play follow-the-leader by ordering sole, clear consume and beer. Last to order, it turns out he can handle the menu and goes for the quenelles, the escargot and a specific wine vintage. He may not have a long career but it's a funny and satisfying moment...or the young wife who each week drops off her aging husband at a fine noodle restaurant for lunch, but then must quickly leave for an hour to visit the bank, accompanied by the young chauffeur...or food as an aphrodisiac, with dancing shrimp on a naked tummy, new uses for whipped cream, and a raw egg passed back and forth by mouth between two lovers. (Note to self Take a pass on that one, too.) We learn all kinds of good things...how to cook a rice omelet for Tampopo's little boy that had my stomach grumbling with hunger...sharing grilled Korean kalbi, snipping the hot, marinated meat from the short ribs, wrapping it in lettuce and munching...filling a thin pancake with a smear of hoisin, shredded scallion, pieces of crisp duck skin with fat and some duck meat, then wrapping it up and chewing it down. Most of all, we learn about noodle soup, the different kinds and styles. It's not just the broth that must be outstanding, so must be the noodles. I see improvement, but we want customers to line up, says one friend and adviser discussing Tampopo's noodles. They're beginning to have depth but they still lack balance, says another. They're not alive enough. They lack vigor, says a third. And they still lack profundity, adds a fourth. Tampopo has some exacting teachers. All things sooner or later have their conclusions, and so does Tampopo. The side stories eventually are resolved, Tampopo's noodle soup is a great success. We don't know what might happen with Goro, but the drunken lout we met at the start of the movie has turned out to be a nice guy. And he likes Tampopo more than he lets on. We close with one of the happiest and most satisfying images about humans and food there is...a baby contently and single-mindedly having lunch at the breast of his young mother. It's a charming end to a charming movie.

She's not helped by the fact that, frankly, her noodle soup isn't so good, as Goro tells her after an altercation with the drunk Pisken, one of her regulars. So, in the spirit of Shane, Goro decides (with the help of some friends) to help Tampopo make the perfect noodle soup.This is the main thread of the story, but weaved in amongst it are a succession of vignettes that show the role of food in Japanese society. Some are funny, some touching and some revel in the sensual pleasure that food and its eating can bring.Standout scenes include ordering lunch in a French restaurant for a group of salarymen; a teacher at a finishing school trying to show a group of young women how to eat spaghetti, Western style; a family eating the last meal made by their dying mother, not to mention the infamous scene with a gangster, his moll and a raw egg yolk (not to mention crayfish!).Each interlude is insightful in some way about the role of food in Japanese life. The role of women in this is touched upon too; each time something positive or good happens, somewhere along the line a woman is involved. In fact the film as a whole tells us a lot about the Japanese character, not just how it connects with food.The ending is probably predictable Tampopo's reinvigorated shop becomes a resounding success, but in all honesty, just like life itself, the journey to that point is the most important and interesting thing.

So I'm disappointed to say I only liked it this time. The movie follows a spaghetti-Westernish story of a woman learning to become a master noodle chef in a world where it seems people think about little else but noodles, interwoven with various quirky episodes portraying food obsession. I recall this movie being very funny, but this time I find it more odd than funny. It is a fascinating way to look at the world and some of it is very clever. On the other hand, some episodes seem dumb or pointless to me and the director is a little too willing to commit to a long shot of something not especially interesting, like people eating noodles in real time.While I didn't like it as much this time around, it is a fascinating portrayal of Japanese cultural via food. It's also a movie that made me very curious to try that sort of noodle dish. I only have once. Oddly enough it was at some food place at an airport in the Midwest, but I quite enjoyed it.

Japanese prefer FRESH food, unlike North Americans who are content to eat food as far removed from its source as possible and probably several days or weeks old...funny enough, in traditional Japanese society every thing is believed to have a spirit and therefore eating a vegetable is equal to eating an animal, cooked or not, so from this perspective eating a raw carrot is no different than eating raw shrimp...which by the way, they are not live, they are simply raw, but they are still moving... shrimp are the cockroaches of the sea - I wonder if people would post the same rants on animal cruelty if they were eating live insects? Everything alive, consumes SOMETHING to survive, there is no cruelty here, there is no vivasection, no maiming for sport, no torture for pleasure, just aspects of eastern culinary culture that is misunderstood by westerners.*** French Cuisine - the vignette with the VIPs eating in an expensive restaurant are looking at a FRENCH menu, it is NOT Italian*** the homeless guy prepares Omrice (Omlette Rice) for the young boy with the deftness of a skilled chef - many westerners are not familiar with this common Japanese dish because it is akin to American macaroni and cheese - something our mums prepare for us as kids, not usually available in Western Japanese Restaurants! This dish is usually made with day old left-over steamed white rice and mixed with left over diced chicken, green peas, sliced onion and American Ketchup, enveloped in a plain omlette, topped with more Ketchup...Japanese kids love it!

Yes it is a comment or satire of society but more specifically about the dependence of society on woman or the importance of a woman's role in society.

Food is life in Japan (as anywhere else), and it affects every aspect of it. Is it odd for the gangster character to introduce the movie by talking to us, the audience, in an attempt to make us a participant in the art? Is it a coincidence that an old master instructs in the complex subtleties of eating noodles at the beginning of the movie, and a baby reflects the simplicity of enjoying the most basic of nourishment sources at the end? The seemingly unrelated interludes/vignettes also offer not-too-subtle hints of Japanese culture group conformity (business lunch/spaghetti etiquette), the marginalized/disenfranchised (elderly, criminal, woman/mother), and of course sex (raw egg, oyster, and dentist office). The frequent appearance of trains/monorail in the movies has caught my attention, but it simply teases me as I try unsuccessfully to grasp what it might suggest. Of course, none of this is essential to enjoy the movie. It is more than enough to just sit back and savor the sights and sounds of delicious food being prepared and eaten.

Two guys happen upon a woman named Tampopo (Dandelion) trying to manage a run-down noodle shop and they decide to help her turn the place into an economic and gastronomic four-diamond establishment.  They succeed.  That's the plot.  The whole plot.But the film is fleshed out with episodes, usually unrelated to one another, some of them as amusing as anything ever put on the screen.  Every single sidesplitting one is played and directed in a straight-faced way.I'll give just one example.  A gangster and his beautiful moll are about to make love.  They kiss passionately.  The camera moves in for a closeup of their lips and we see that a raw egg is being slipped back and forth between mouths.  The couple progress to foreplay in the nude.  The foreplay consists of the man slapping a clear plastic pint of live shrimp upside down on his lover's belly.  The shrimp skitter around on her flesh and she titters and writhes with desire.  Later, alas, the young man is shot multiple times by rival mobsters.  He's sprawled on his back in the dirt, his white clothes soaked with blood.  She rushes to him and kneels beside him, weeping.  He goes into the cliche of the last dying words, barely able to gasp them out.  What does he tell her?  That he loves her?  That he regrets his disreputable life?  No -- he launches into an outrageously long story about hunting boars when he was a child.  The boars would eat nothing but yams, when the yams were ripe.  They became stuffed with yams and nothing but yams.  Then when they were hunted down, the boars yielded long strings of intestines that were packed with yams.  They were like yam sausages, you see.  I don't think I caught the tail end of his narrative because I was dissolved in laughter.The whole thing revolves around food in its various forms.  People rise from the dead to cook a final meal for their grieving families.  They prepare the most mouthwatering rice omelettes imaginable.  Proper young ladies learn how to eat noodles without making vulgar sounds.  They do all sorts of things with and about food.  Cuisine is to this movie what sex is to Italian comedies.Do not be put off by the fact that this movie has subtitles.  In poor movies subtitles are a distracting nuisance.

He is facing the camera and he begins addressing the audience of the movie Tampopo! Then, the credits roll. That's certainly unusual, huh?! The main story is about a rather run down noodle shop owned by a lady named Tampopo. Two truckers enter the shop and get in a fight. The next morning, the one trucker who got beaten up is fed by Tampopo. She asks him and the other trucker what they thought of the noodle dish she'd made them the night before, so they reluctantly tell her it was BAD! She wants to make it better but just doesn't know where to start, so she asks for their help. The hero of the story (the guy who got beat up) it a bit of an obsessive nut about ramen and he takes her under his wing. Through the course of the movie, they meet various people who all agree to help her--one helps her improve her broth, one to improve her noodles, one to remodel the restaurant, etc. All this is done with a healthy dose of heart and a light comedic touch. Despite this ONLY being a noodle restaurant, it seems at times reminiscent of either Rocky or the Magnificent Seven! Additionally, there are several small stories that seem to randomly enter the movie from time to time. All center on the theme of food and those who adore it. Particularly strange is the same gangster who has an intense food fetish. Be forewarned parents, the scenes he has with his girlfriend are a bit graphic. Even the end of the movie stresses this same theme as the camera pans onto a scene of an infant happily sucking away at his mother's breast!

The French new wave consisted of three types of ideas. They had notions about explicitly acknowledging the camera. That's such an ordinary notion these days that it is impossible to appreciate. And in any case, no French thinker invented the idea.A second component was the importation of key stereotypes from American movies applied in a real world context in a manner of folding fiction into reality (with the irony that the reality itself was fictional). This is what the average critic associates with New Wave.The third component was the most trenchant, but is nearly impossible to recognize today, much less appreciate. Society was undergoing change &#151; not in the radical way we all thought at the time, but in a more subtle, nuanced way old means to accommodate damaged society were being replaced by new ones. Those new ones are immune to the old challenges and seem now like God made the world that way from the beginning (about 3500 ago?). New wave film challenged these old strictures in a direct manner as its primary task. Since we can't see the target, we miss the point all together and (in a sad irony) take the stories at face value.Now into the long still tailwind enters Itami who makes a New New Wave film. It fits the mold in all three ways, but those three are more clearly seen by this American viewer.We have the acknowledgment that it is a film, what with the camera whose presence creates the linkage among stories. And the copious references to past movies. In this case the references &#151; I'm talking tone and style here, not story and character &#151; include as many Asian (mostly Japanese) references as western.We have the standard American film stereotypes. In French new wave that was the gangster, in Italian new wave, the cowboy. Here we have both. Film as food. Film as food. Perfect, nuanced, deep film as similarly sacred food. This even starts with a film-within prologue with the gangster talking directly to us about the intent.Its a novel idea, doing a new new wave film and making the references to the nature of film being about the nature of food. To make it explicit is a scene where older Japanese thickheads are embarrassed by a younger Japanese who is extensively familiar with the French vocabulary. There's a similar scene on the Italian side, pungently misogynistic.But it is the third element that fascinates me. That element does as much damage to all things in Japanese society as it can, those elements that are arbitrary yet solid. These are a little more accessible to this viewer than the fairly ephemeral concerns of Godard and Truffault.Japanese in general inherit many things in their life from the Chinese giant. All these things they differentiate from their Chinese origins by extreme elaboration. Everything becomes extremely stylized, so much that the most pedestrian of Chinese things can become the basis and meaning for an entire Japanese life. Things like tea, flowers, drawing, packaging... Even a lowly bowl of soup, the soup that factory workers would eat at a diner becomes a matter of celestial obsession.I'm not Japanese, so these stabs don't tingle. But I can recognize them, most of them.Along the way, we have &#151; in the gangster, his moll and her idealization as oyster and oystergirl&#151; one or two of the most sensual cinema images in existence.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching. "},{"Title":"Food Porn","Date":"1 August 2014","Score":"0 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" This is quite literally food pornography in many scenes. You can accurately judge the whole film by the credits scene, which is a 2 minute close up of a woman's nipple as she feeds her baby.The film documents the rather Japanese obsession with food and the correct way to eat, prepare, or order it. You can tie it into sexual repression and the replacement of enjoying food instead of enjoying sex. (There is no kissing or sex between any of the characters in the two main love stories, unless food is in their mouths.)The main story of a woman seeking to become the best noodle chef is supplemented by several short scenes of random strangers that are loosely based on the food theme as well, but otherwise have nothing to do with the main narrative. A lot of people would probably like this film a lot more if those unrelated scenes were cut out, leaving the main narrative at about 1 1/2 hours. As is, they are often very seriously filmed while meant to be darkly, bizarrely comical. I don't think many people will find them funny, and some scenes actually reinforce a lot of negative ideals in Japan. For example, a couples' food fetishism beginning when a gangster buys an oyster from a child diver (she might be 12 or so) and eats it from her hand, whereby they start making out. A husband attempts to keep his wife alive a few minutes longer by demanding she make the family dinner before dying. An old lady with dementia damages all the food in a grocery store while inspecting it, and the store owner chases her around the store.These highlight very real issues in Japan. Ignored mental illness in the elderly. Rigid gender roles and unhappy marriages. The worship and fetishization of young girls by men old enough to be their fathers. Far from being a document of these issues, the film does not seem to censure them in anyway, and actually to support them a bit. Take them out and you're still left with a main story that has hollow comedy, is mired in boring details, and has an irresolute love story. And it's all built around the idea that a woman needs a team of men to teach her how to be a good noodle cook, despite one's comment that I never believed a woman could be as good of a noodle chef as a man!Frankly, it's a movie that is cleverly directed, but whose story and tone were archaic at the time, and are even more disgusting by modern standards. Look elsewhere for depth or entertainment.

The requirements for showing movies at ninja night were, that the movies had to be either kung-fu or so retarded that they were hilarious.Have you ever laughed so hard that you stop breathing and fall down? This is one of those movies. Apparently, it was made before things had to make sense. This movie displays the logic of a six year old child combined with John Wayne and a drug dealer.I found the part with the terminally ill mother so funny that I had to go outside to catch my breath because I was hyperventilating. It is the only movie that could possibly make a terminal illness funny. "},{"Title":"Animal Cruelty!","Date":"11 March 2006","Score":"1 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I have mixed emotions with Tampopo. It is an unusual wonderful comedy about food. However, there is REAL animal cruelty involved in this film and therefore, makes the movie worthless.It begins with live shrimps that are used as a sexual object. This scene is wonderful, but why do we need to see this torture to the fish. The most horrible scene is the scene with the Sea Turtle. The turtle is butchered in front of our eyes and is bleeding for many seconds in front of the camera. In my opinion, this is a crime.Films are the illusion of the real life. Therefore, animals should not be used to satisfy our need for entertainment. There are many films that show animal cruelty in a sophisticated way, without hurting a single animal. (Amores Perros (1999) or Cold Mountain (2003))These films use high quality animatronics and dummies, and look exactly like the real thing.I would like to see a cut version of Tampopo, without the scenes that show animal cruelty. These scenes really don't serve any purpose in the film. Without it the film is great anyway.

This is directed only to the people mentioned in my subject line. So I suppose any did not find this helpful marks beside my review will indicate how many animal haters there are on IMDb. Sad.Plain & simple, we see a bunch of animal cruelty and torture in this film. It's not necessarily gratuitous; from what I've read about Asian culture it's perfectly normal to cut up a turtle and bleed it alive. But I thought the sensitive viewers out there ought to have a heads up. Scenes like that may ruin your fun.Ciao.*edit* My post is not long enough, so jeez... I guess I'll mention a few other foreign films that might disturb you with live animal killings. (The American Humane Association obviously does not monitor films produced overseas)OLDBOY (Korea) - Squids are eaten alive, writhing & struggling.ANDREY RUBLYOV (Russia) - A horse is shot to deathMANDERLAY (Denmark) - donkey butchered. The scene was later cut.AMORES PERROS (Mexico) - dogs killed (?) questionable... no one's talkingAPOCALYPSE NOW (filmed in Philippines) - buffalo partially decapitatedIf this kind of stuff doesn't bother you, then no problem. But to the more sensitive viewers, you may want to research all foreign (non-AHA regulated) films before watching. Ciao again. "}]
