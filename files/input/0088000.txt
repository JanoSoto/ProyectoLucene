What kinds of films influenced American Pie and Road Trip? It is easy to point out films like Porky's, Animal House and Fasttimes, but somewhere forgotten in all this is Jeff Kanew's hilarious flick REVENGE OF THE NERDS. This is not only entertaining and funny, but it contains what has to be considered a blue print for success in campus comedy. Take lots of people getting drunk, jocks ostracizing nerds from there way of life, the weak rising up to take back what is just as much a right as it is to others, and of course lots of nudity featuring an abundance of gorgeous women. What you have here is a great recipe for success.What made Revenge work is that it didn't try to pretend to be something that it wasn't. This was an exploitive sex-fest and it worked well. What it also had was a funny script and one that we could all relate to. I mean, who hasn't felt left out or relegated to the side lines while someone else gets all the glory? Besides being extremely funny, this film touched on something that we all can relate to.Revenge of the Nerds is another of the teen films that was hilarious and it ended up spawning a slew of sequels. Avoid them and see this one again. It's worth it, especially if you were a teen when it came out. And if you are a teen now, this is a treat to watch. This is one of the films that writers study when they are thinking what they can put into their film to make it crude, rude and raunchy. This should be a must see!9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"I'm PROUD to be a nerd","Date":"9 May 2005","Score":"44 out of 63 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I first saw Revenge of the Nerds when I was ten (that's right, ten).

After I saw ROTF, I was finally proud to call myself a nerd (albeit not one who wears glasses, has buck teeth, and has his pant legs halfway up his calves).It's especially great that the nerds were such a diverse group of people (Booger may have been gross, but he clearly had a brain).And there's also an interesting thing about the cast. Robert Carradine must be the only person who has co-starred with both Jane Fonda (he played the brother in Coming Home) and with the guy who played Booger. And I never realized that Stan was played by the same guy who played Roger on Happy Days.So, if you're any kind of individual who has spent his/her life getting bullied, this is the movie for you!

The film does not really go anywhere much at all, the jokes work only about half the time, and it is all a bit short on its content, but despite all of this, the film has a pleasant and rather enjoyable nature not common to the average college comedy, and this makes it a rather uniquely likable film overall.

Yes, the film is predictable as they come as we've seen this formula a million times, but it's watchable thanks to some wonderful set pieces, outrageous dialogue and on target performances by Robert Carradine, Anthony Edwards, Curtis Armstrong (memorable as Booger), John Goodman, Ted McGinley (no that is not a misprint), Larry B.

When the nerds form their own chapter of the Tri-Lam fraternity. When they are bullied continually they decide to take matters into their own hands and fight back with the Jock's own games.If there's one genre in the world that I hate it's the American college jock/nerd comedy.  Whether it be the Animal House or Porky's or more modern ones &#150; I hate almost all of them!  So when I watched this I watched it with a certain fear.  However the plot makes redresses the balance by having us support the nerds!  It's well plotted so that it isn't just them becoming just like the jocks but instead learning their own lessons.  Of course it is rude at times and does fall into being just silly and slapstick, but it's mixed nicely with some good sentiment and more gentle laugh.The cast is great (in retrospect).  Anthony Edwards is a real surprise in this post-ER time.  Likewise Busfield is strange after 30-something and West Wing.  Less so but Moonlighting's Curtis Armstrong is funny to see.  And lets not forget James Cromwell (or Jamie as he was called then!), John Goodman and black 1970's star Bernie Casey!  The nerds are all good &#150; rising above their caricatures to start to bring out characters.Overall this is a spin on the frat-comedy so it is a little juvenile and silly but the fact that it is spun towards the nerds makes it that little bit refreshing to watch compared to so many where our `heroes' are arrogant, annoying jock-types who sponge off mummy and daddy just to get drunk at college.  Not a great movie but much better than anything else post-Animal House - I'm with the nerds!

While this one is much milder than some of the others, it does have it's moments of raunchiness.The story is simple two young men are attending Adams University; but find out quickly that their type (the gawky, glasses wearing, intellectuals) are treated like nobodies. In fact, any male who isn't a jock or a WASP isn't even allowed to live in the dorms. A group of misfits including the two main characters Lewis and Gilbert are forced to live in the gym. They do find accommodations but they continue to suffer humiliation and embarrassment from the Alpha Betas. And so, like in the title of the movie, they get REVENGE.This is a movie that certainly can't be made today. Affirmative Action certainly would be in place to disallow discrimination on college campuses. The villains make fun of anyone who isn't like them. Still, when it's all said and done the film sends out a message that you should be proud of yourself and how you look and not let anybody tell you otherwise.Yes, as an 80's film you'll see every requisite of the decade, but you'll also see something that's a portent of the future. The Nerds raid the women's dorm so they can cause a distraction so others can install cameras in the bedrooms and showers so they can be spied on. That has become very popular on the 'Net.As for the cast Oh my! You'll never see this intriguing mix too often. Like in Freaky Friday, you'll see a lot of actors who made it big on T.V.Ted McGinley - The leader of the Alpha Betas. He's been on a zillion T.V. shows. I always thought he was more of a nerd than jock.John Goodman - Head coach of the football team. He looked so lean. Along with Roseanne; he's a superb supporting actor in major motion pictures but a weak lead actor.Anthony Edwards - Gilbert Lowell. Dr. Mark Greene on ER. Considered a heartthrob during those years.Robert Carradine - Lewis Skolnick. Member of the Carradine acting family.Timothy Busfield - Poindexter. Elliot Weston on thitysomething.Matt Salinger - Danny Burke. The son of The Catcher In The Rye writer J.D. Salinger.Curtis Armstrong - Booger. Remember him from Moonlighting?Even James Cromwell makes a brief appearance as Lewis' father.As for the comments of Julie Montgomery's beauty; sure she's beautiful. Especially if you like the Kate Moss, Calista Flockhart, J. Cynthia Brooks, Paris Hilton, Samia Ghattas, etc. skin and bones body. I don't, myself.All in all, this is still a good film that does its job. Just avoid the sequels. None of them are good and lack the bite of the first film.

The whole story revolves around brains vs brawn, determination in the face of adversity, and, ultimately, pride in what you are, whether popular or not. The Nerds are ingenious at times, and, despite occasional despair, never quite give up the ship. I hope I'm not making the film sound serious, because it is definitely NOT really serious. It has an awful lot of humor.

Also, just to avoid the wrath of the blindly patriotic, I am by no means saying that other countries and cultures don't have their share of downfalls too.So, to back to the film&#x85; Due to its age, (30 years), one can possibly, (yet begrudgingly), forgive some of the casual racism and homophobia used to gain cheap laughs. However the film really hits rock bottom with its multiple scenes/sub-plots that show sexual abuse in an entirely positive light.There is a highly unlikely, yet possible, chance that the above could be overlooked if the film's humour compensated for the offensiveness, or if the rapey/homophobic/racist plot elements were done tongue in cheek &#x96; BUT THEY WEREN'T &#x96; in spite of what people might claim.Now-a-days I watch certain things, which I enjoy to various degrees, but make me yearn for my stoner days as I know my amusement would be amplified.

This was before Bill Gates rolled over the world and held us up for 100 billion dollars by being a thug nerd. It was during a time when society from President Reagan to high school administrators was championing American virtue rather than intelligence. It was a time when sexual equality and respect for intellectual matters took a few giant steps back. It was before Columbine. It was a time when the jocks ruled.In all times, ordinary comedy pokes fun at the prevailing values and, after the fun, ends with a simple moral. And so it is here. What makes this movie so remarkable are the two morals, one serious, one half-joking.The first is that nerds are better at sex. Despite its titillating wrapper, it presents a profound insight into American society, even today -- though the stereotype of `nerd' has drifted quite a bit. The second is that most people in society are not in the privileged, celebrated  class, at least not in ways that they value.High school comedies fascinate me. That's because high schoolers are faced with a very small selection of personality types among which they must choose. Those who fight the choice actually constitute one of these types. I believe the number to be constant at seven, but that's my own theory. By setting a comedy or drama in high school, something all of us have been through, you get huge shortcuts in setting up the world of your story. The seven types are immediately recognized and you can get on to your parody or whatever you intend. This film is notable in addressing the nature of the world itself.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

But the odd get even, as the tagline states, by forming their own fraternity and proving their power as a four-eyed, accordion-loving, chess-playing group.Of course Revenge of the Nerds wasn't meant to win any awards. It's supposed to be a crude comedy for older teens. The trouble is, none of the crudeness works. The nerds place hidden cameras to watch the popular girls undress. They secretly distribute topless photos of a snotty cheerleader in the bottom of cream pie plates. They smoke pot and throw lame parties. None of it's particularly funny.This film doesn't even work on a level that other unfunny comedies sometimes can. A comedy can be entertaining without being hilarious. But Revenge of the Nerds tries to be little else other than a dumb comedy. At its conclusion, it attempts to deliver a feel-good message about being yourself, but by then it's impossible to take anything it has to say seriously.I really wanted to like this film.

I was keen on watching it again though because it was one of those films (in fact it was the first T&A movie that I ever saw) that I had watched numerous times when I was young. I guess I related to the main characters in these films, being somewhat of an outcast, though unlike these guys, never having a friend, or a group of friends, that I could fall back on (that is until I met the Dungeons and Dragons dorks at the State Library).It is interesting to look at some of the perspectives of this film, in a way the suggestion that the nerds of this film tend to (if they manage to survive high school and college) end up being much more successful than the jocks in this film. There is a lot of subtle imagery in it though, with the jocks being a part of a fraternity known as the Alpha-Betas, suggesting that they are the premier people on the campus.There are things that differ between my experience of university though because, being an Australian, campus life here is much different. Firstly we do not have fraternities or sororities. They simply do not exist. Secondly there is no faculty of sport in Australian universities, so you will not actually encounter anybody like the Alpha-Betas here.The other interesting thing about the characters in this film is that while it is reflective of campus life in the United States, it also brings to mind how many of the Alpha-Betas, being the sporting heroes, are unlikely to live out their days in luxury. Sporting heroes (and others in the entertainment industry) become millionaires, however it is the nerds and the geeks who become billionaires. However, the future is generally not at the forefront of people's mind when they are undergoing persecution. Granted, Gilbert does speak of Nerd Persecution at the end of the film, and I guess in a way it does exist, however in this film they use their brains to fight back, and they win. It is also interesting to note that the Alpha-Betas use fear to rule the campus, and it is only when that fear is broken (by everybody coming to understand that anybody who is not an Alpha-Beta, is by definition, a nerd) that the power of the Alpha-Betas is broken.However, while this film may have some place in my heart, it is still a T&A movie, and to be honest with you, I really don't find it all that funny anyway.

They acted like the Mary Sues and Gary Stus you'd read in fanfiction. They're too annoying, they're way too impossible to like or care about.Plus, where are the other cliques like the punks since they were a clique in the 80's, so why aren't they there too? Another problem I have with the film is the writing which is the script itself, it's not so good. The dialogue is more annoying, the acting didn't help although actors such as John Goodman tried to make the best out of it.And the jokes aren't very good, they're just not funny. The thing is, call me bias or anything but I felt that the film was trying to imitate Animal House but it failed so badly at doing that. If John Landis was somehow offered to direct the film and rejected it, I can see why.The only good things about it were John Goodman and Bernie Casey, they played their roles and made the best out of the script they were given.And the choice of music is pretty good, the theme song is pretty catchy, a bit annoying but catchy.I'm sorry to the Nerds fanbase but this film just isn't very good, bash me and flame me all you like but it won't change my opinion.Overall, 3/10 from me.

Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards star as two college bound nerds who find that college life isn't what they expected. It's nothing more than a continuation of high school as they get picked on my jocks and laughed at by the pretty girls. But now they've finally had enough and they decide to stand up for themselves and fight back against the jocks and to wipe away the nerd stereotype for good. A collection of exaggerated antics ensue, and it all makes for a wacky good time.Like I said, Revenge of the Nerds has everything you could expect from an 80's comedy. It fits the formula almost too well, which might be why it has achieved an underground cult status. For me, I think the 80's comedy formula just doesn't work and it doesn't entice me as much as a more offbeat or alternative comedy film might. Revenge of the Nerds is just silly, crude, and over the top, but it's certainly not trying to be anything it's not. So for this I can enjoy this nutty little film for what it is. I didn't find it particularly hilarious, but it has its moments and it's certainly a nonstop ride of entertainment. It's not exactly my thing, but it's plenty fun for what it is.It's unfair to judge Revenge of the Nerds as anything other than a very straightforward comedy, so I won't look at it as anything other than that.

Yes, it really is that poorly conceived.The movie is almost entirely plot less. It consists of a couple of nerds, played by Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards (later of E.R. fame) who go to a new college, join up with other nerds, and have various encounters with the jocks. For much of the running time they perve on naked women and trick others into having sex with them. It's misogynistic, and fairly unpleasant.Unfortunately, the film is just too stupid to make more of an impact or to allow oneself to get offended by it. There are lots of famous faces in the cast, from John Goodman to Bernie Casey and one Jamie Cromwell, but none of them have a lot to work with.

I will be the first to say college is a place that like high school, has a kind of hierarchy that is unfair. However, while coaches do make money and have some pull, they are not going to literally run a college campus, nor or smart kids, or nerds going to be tormented to this degree. Snubbed, yes, but I just did not see the name calling and such like depicted in the film when I was at college. To many older students, people who are middle aged so things like that are not going to happen as much. Now I do see a lot of the things happening in this film being like a high school cause I myself faced things like seen here during my time in high school. If only I could go back now and relive it at the size I am now, I would enjoy ripping the arms out of my fellow students' sockets. Or when one of them came up to me and said 'remember me', it was permissible by law to smash their faces in. Why did I have to become big and strong enough to destroy people at an age when it is frowned upon? Sigh...I digress, this film looks at a couple of guys starting their time in a college where they are sure things are going to be different. Well it is not, but during the course of the film, the nerds of the film do things that are just as bad as what the jocks do. There are some funny scenes, but at times one thinks that it is going to far such as tricking a girl to have sex with you, I guarantee she is not going to be as pleasant upon finding out the deception as she had here. There is also the idiotic robot, I do care how smart they are, they are not going to build a fully functional robot capable of the things this one is depicted as doing. Still, I liked the nerds trying to join a fraternity, liked the competition, the movie does have some funny things. It also has stuff that makes no sense, seriously why is Booger one of the nerds?

"},{"Title":"Elements, Factors, and Aspects of Revenge of the Nerds","Date":"18 June 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" An iconic film of the 80s, Revenge of the Nerds has served as a prototype film for many of the college films that have come out since this time frame. While we see this film as more of an afterthought in our modern era, Revenge of the Nerds was viewed as a breath of fresh air when it came to hilarity within the everyday life on a college campus. The theme of the film has mainly to do with the everyday stereotype of Jocks vs. Geeks, and the everyday struggles of the nerds at the hands of their more superior opposites. Yet mostly, the theme within this movie relates to the everyday college life of students in general.The plot mainly centers on a group of geeks trying to outsmart and establish themselves on the campus of Adams College; all while trying to avoid utter embarrassment and humiliation at the hands of the Jocks. The leaders of the nerds, Lewis Skolnick (Robert Carradine) and Gilbert Lowe (Anthony Edwards), are in a battle to establish the nerds into a fraternity within the campus after their frat house was overtaken by the jocks from the football team; with Stan Gable (Ted Mcginley) serving as the main antagonist from that group. What commences throughout the film from this point is a series of back and forth jock vs. nerds games that conclude with the nerds being embarrassed and humiliated the majority of the times. As the film progresses through these series of subliminal antics and humor, the culmination of the horseplay concludes within the school's Greek Games, in which the nerds finally overtake the jocks from the football team and claim a final victory.While the plot centers mainly on the shenanigans of the characters, it is hard not to ignore the nature of some of the action that goes on mainly within this film. Content such as the language, brief scenes of nudity, and overall complex of the setting depicts mainly what a typical college campus was like. The acting when it came to this content is comparable only to more modern films within The American Pie films. Speaking of which, this film is pretty much a pioneer for those types of films; like The American Pie and Van Wilder sequels. In these films, the themes are pretty much the same when it comes to the hilarity that is portrayed throughout the various scenes of these films. Additionally, what makes these movies so similar in comparison is the use of the camera angles and lighting within their scenes of humor.In terms of the camera angles, there is a serious approach to extracting numerous humorous content through the use of Telephoto Lenses, Fish-Eye Lenses, and the changes of camera angles through the use of zooming and panning. Likewise, the lighting within the various environments is more contemporary than anything, but when it comes to the humor scenes, there is more of a dusk kind of look whenever the nerds are humiliated in front of others.With all these factors mentioned, The Revenge of the Nerds is indeed an 80's classic; due in large part to the way that the nature of its humor reflected to the era of the film. While seeing it now clearly shows areas of old school, it is regardless a freshening experience due to how life is viewed without the modernism that we are accustomed to in today's world. In essence, this is simply just a movie about a group of new students who do not fit in any of the other social groups because they are fat, not attractive or nerdy group together and form their own fraternity. And although it does suffer from a predictable storyline, it is still an enjoyable movie. To fully enjoy this movie you need to appreciate, and be a fan of 80s comedies otherwise this may not appeal to you. This movie is definitely not for children or those who don't like bad language or nudity. However if you enjoyed other 80s style comedies this should appeal to you.

And Revenge of the Nerds is no exception. Characterisation is scant, jokes obvious, dialogue clich√©d, and performances running the gamut from bad to worse. Yet it is the heart to this film that made me keep watching, long after I normally would have switched off.At times it is nasty natured, that I give you (I'm fairly sure the protagonists voyeuristic acts in the girls dorm is illegal), and it doesn't exactly paint the youth of any generation in a good light (this was 1984; things have only gotten worse), but the main thing that kept drawing me in was the romance between Anthony Edwards and Michelle Meyrink as Gilbert and Judy. They have chemistry, they're cute, they work together. They're kind of at the centre of this film, and it's a good centre to have.The plot doesn't really matter, because it's just an excuse for some set pieces and punchlines, but at times it seems like the writers have looked at certain scenarios, and stuck the same punchline on each of them (David Carradines nasal, annoying, yet amusing laugh).I did find it a little hard to believe that David Carradine would pull with campus hotty Betty Childs, played by Julia Montgomery in a performance that doesn't really require any acting skill other than the ability to deliver lines saucily, and to not be embarrassed when she gets her breasts out (she does both of these). However I did find it a little hard to believe that she would be won over by Carradine because he is good at sex, and when he said that all nerds think about is sex, which is why he was so good at it, this provided a contradiction with earlier dialogue from him, as well as a complete non-truth.This, and the fact that a character such as Ogre (Donald Gibb) would be in a university at all, are the only real bum notes the film pulls. I did also have a problem with some of the nudity, as it felt out of place, and gave this film an 'R' rating when it probably would have grossed a lot more with a PG-13. As I have mentioned, a lot of the acts in this film are illegal.Pluses include the wonderfully rebellious 'Booger', played to perfection by Curtis Armstrong, the final speech, delivered to Queen's 'We Are The Champions', and a party that begins as an awkward affair, and descends into a drug-fuelled orgy (remember kids, drugs are bad!).At times it is a little hard to know who the audience for this film is, because it is an incredibly sweet movie, with a message that is good for kids, yet it has, as I have mentioned, scenes of nudity, drug taking, and a bestiality joke that made me feel a little uncomfortable.Yet there is a nice message here, and the ensemble pulls it off nicely (if you can forgive the horrendous gay stereotyping). I'd put it in front of The Great Outdoors and behind Planes, Trains, and Automobiles on a sliding scale, and that is not bad company to be in.7 stars.

Amidst all the sex and party-obsessed college stereotyping and seemingly unrealistic projection of the high school nerds vs. jocks concept onto the college scene, these nerds are pretty likable characters and their pranks make for the most classic college movie scenes outside of Animal House.Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards play high school best friends (and bonafide nerds equipped with ridiculous inhaling laughs) who struggle to fit in to the college scene. When the jock fraternity -- the Alpha Betas -- burn their house down, they kick the freshmen out of their dorms and somehow they all get stuck living in the gym. After fraternity rush only the nerds are left homeless, so to get out, they try and start a fraternity, eventually gaining charter status with Lambda Lambda Lambda, a historically black fraternity.At odds with the nerds are the Alpha Betas and their sister sorority the Pis. Both groups try and make life a living hell for the nerds, who decide to use their high IQs to fight back. They kick it off with the infamous panty raid, busting into the Pi house and stealing the girls' underwear while also installing surveillance cameras in bathrooms and such. Once you get over the hump that there's no feasible way for Revenge of the Nerds to ever take place and that jocks and nerds would never have a rivalry going in a college setting, this movie becomes classic. There's a lot of clever scene writing which completely makes up for the one-dimensional characters -- namely the jocks. In all other movies it would all seem completely stupid, but Nerds delivers with just the right attitude to not provoke your criticisms.The nerds and their nerd girl friends are also great characters. Lewis and Gilbert as the lead nerds are really quite endearing. There's a naivety in their performances that keeps them from turning into completely nerd stereotypes. Also, the writing team doesn't try the pointless technique of providing subplots for all the other members of the Tri-Lams. They might be stereotypes, but their comedic value is greater because they fill out the off-color picture of the nerds. Truthfully, there are so many ways Revenge of the Nerds could have slipped and become a mediocre movie, but for these reasons it remains one of the more memorable college frat movies of all time.~Steven CVisit my site http//moviemusereviews.com "},{"Title":"Still a riot after all these years","Date":"7 August 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Geeky Louis Skolnick (the excellent Robert Carradine) and his awkward best friend Gilbert Lowell (an equally fine Anthony Edwards) find themselves the odd men out at Adams College. Louis, Gilbert, and a bunch of fellow academic misfits start their own fraternity. When the jocks fiercely persecute the quirky frat, our nerdy heroes decide it's time to fight back against their cool, yet cruel oppressors. Directing Jeff Kanew, working from a bright and witty script Steve Zacharias and Jeff Buhai, relates the lively story at a constant zippy pace, stages a bunch of amusing throwaway gags with considerable aplomb, and maintains an infectiously good-natured tone throughout. Granted, we get the expected dope gags and leering female nudity, but fortunately the humor manages to stay on the right side of raunchy and raucous without ever becoming too crass or sleazy. Moreover, the appealing cast play their parts with tremendous energy and enthusiasm Carradine and Edwards make for utterly engaging leads, with tip-top support from Ted McGinley as hateful head jock Stan Gable, Julie Montgomery as stuck-up cheerleader Betty Childs, Curtis Armstrong as blithely disgusting slob Booger, Larry B.

Comic highlights include the nerds' disastrous frat party, a rowdy panty raid, Booger always cheating at cards with Takashi, Booger's monstrous belch, and the nerds performing a simply amazing song and dance routine at a talent show (complete with funky rap singing and gnarly break dancing!). Best of all, there's even a positive central message about standing up for yourself and being proud of who you are.

R.O.N. was probably intended to be a B movie however, it ended up being far more than that, similar to the phenomenon that Napoleon Dynamite had 20 years later. The film features a somewhat unique perspective of the underdogs overcoming adversity. Although this film is probably geared more towards being a teen flick, it certainly can have a much broader audience appeal.Robert Carradine's performance of Lewis, the head geek, is so on target, I think he may have type cast himself into that character. Though, his choosing to remain with the franchise for three additional sequels is somewhat questionable as they were of inferior quality scripts. Timmothy Bustfiel is also great as Poindexter, as is Curtis Armstrong as Booger. Anthony Edwards certainly became the biggest star of this bunch, and was amicable as Gilbert, the more introverted of our favorite nerds. And this was just before John Goodman started on Rosanne.Aside from all the various geek clich√©s that are featured in the films, there is ample potty humor & shtick, some marijuana humor, and plenty of T&A. Definitely is worth the 90 minutes to watch, and better to rent than try to watch on TV, as the language and nudity which makes it funnier is cut.

I love this movie for many reasons. It is well acted..and a great feel good movie-- if you are in a bad funk, watch it and you will be smiling in no time. I am a female so personally I could care less about the nudity involved but the theme is genius. The party scene was a classic. Sadly they would never have something in a teen movie like this today. The nerd topic has really never been touched upon like this until now and in a way that even the most clueless athlete could understand-- People have feelings and everyone has a little of everything in them. So many people have had miserable experiences in school and although we all knew about it no one cared in the schools if they were tortured verbally or ostricized and it was never really acknowledged in this depth in a movie. The movie is not THAT deep-- but it gets points across without being aware and without being preachy ( until the end-- which was too sappy IMO --that is why I gave it a 9 instead of a 10) It is satirical as it gets the point across well. Nerds deserve to be treated with respect and have so much to offer to the world and do-- but are always unappreciated. Even the jocks do see and are truthfully jealous of the nerds when they see how their abilities ( fixing up the house and their awesome inventions etc) have an advantage. They might even like the nerds but would never admit it. As silly and juvenile as these plots seem they are genius in the fact that they are explored in this movie in a unique way. I could watch this movie over and over-- I have seen it at least 15x since 1988. I do not own it now bc one of my kids friends borrowed it and I never received it back... ) Stay away from the sequels-- nothing to compare to the original....

We were doing a game in which you had a partner who would observe you at close range while you were walking around the classroom. This partner would then have to exaggerate your walk twice first a little bit, then a lot. Everyone laughed at the first bit of exaggeration, but everyone knew that the second part was going too far. Thus, the stereotype line you can't take your stereotypes too far.I also have a theory that works a little like the Uncanny Valley. If you're going to have stereotypes in your movie, you can't take them too far, but you can't take them too lightly. Thus, the perfect point to be is just before the stereotype line. If you can manage to get there, your movie will be funny. Revenge of the Nerds hits that point. And as such, it is very funny.Nerds is home to a whole bunch of stereotypes your giant-glasses nerds, your gay black guy, your super-smart kid, your lazy drug-maestro guy, your big dumb jock who doesn't say much, your football coach who hates everybody, your Bob Balaban school dean, your nerdy guy who tries in vain to play the violin, your Japanese immigrant who doesn't speak English all that well, your nerdy woman. However, this film manages to get the stereotypes to just the right level, making each and every character extremely funny.It also doesn't hurt that the plot works. Yes, the plot may be a little generic, but somehow it works here. It's probably because of the occasional deviations from traditional slapstick comedy structure that this movie really works. In truth, I may have never seen a funnier movie. I certainly have never seen one this funny with a score this good and a cast that works so well together.My recommendation? Just go buy the movie.

The Nerds were sick and tired of being picked on by their enemies, so they fought back. Using such tactics like liquid heat in their underwear(Flyer). Personally, the jocks were jerks. McKinley and Gibb could be reasoned with, but Sallinger(Burke)? I wanted to tear that sunnivamutt's freakin' head off--and make bookends with Goodman's character(Coach Brown), too. Why was that guy a Brown? Insult to my last name! Whoa now, lets not go too far to the left. Armstrong's Booger Dawson wasn't no angel, either. The other nerds were fine and all, but Dawson royally sucked socks! He was definitely called Booger not because he picked his nose, but mucus could be found between his ears instead of a brain. Overall, the movie earned a 5 out of 10. The idiots who wrote the script made the film too crude and crass for its own good. The nudity was not a problem. In fact, I would rather see the whole cast nude from the 20th Century Fox logo to the end credits than to put up with the screwed-up dialogue from some of the characters, especially butt-wipes Booger and Burke! The sequel and the two TV Movies were much more fun, especially the second TV Movie, Nerds in Love. Wackier, Sillier, and Booger was less of a Booger there.

The real Revenge of the Nerds is being an established adult and telling the jocks to throw some salt in the bag and make sure the damn fries are hot. The movie is interesting at this point simply because it shows how much attitudes have changed in a relatively short time.  If you're a computer geek like me it's scarcely believable.

Here, we will see that, regardless of the ending, the nerds never got their revenge.The stereotypical jocks, the Alpha Betas, have no reason to hate nerds. From the beginning, the character Ogre merely pigeonholes two innocent freshmen as nerds. The motive behind the character is never laid out. I surmise it is a cultural standard for the 1980's to hate nerds, and we as the audience are expected to understand that. This is the crucial point that one must remind himself of constantly as he watches this movie. To watch this movie in the 21st century is to endure a staggering barrage of prejudices against race, sexual orientation, and of course against those with high IQs. In fact, watching this movie now will jar your perception about prejudices in general; it will make the viewer say, Hell, I didn't even know that was something worth being prejudiced about. The viewer will simply shake his head and ask, Why? And I say now why? Why was there just so much hatred against intellectualism in the 1980's that Hollywood devoted a full-blown movie to it? This question is virtually screamed when analyzing Dean Ulich. Dean Ulich is a self-identifying nerd with no backbone (note that nerd and no-backbone are not synonymous, although that's apparently a stereotype in this film). Dean Ulich runs a school where an entire building on campus burns down, and he brushes it off. He moderates a Greek council where there is no such concept as conflict-of-interest. Obviously, if this were real life, the Dean would have been impeached and sued in civil court for a motley of negligences, ranging from a house on campus being broken into and overrun with pigs to condoning an entire police force from looking the other way as soon as it has to do with fraternities (what else would campus police do then?).Overall, it's difficult to muster the suspension for disbelief when people are spying on girls in the the bathroom (illegal wiretapping), impersonating as someone else while having sex (rape), and cheating their way to win in the school's most important social competition (using illegal drugs in a competition, especially when trichloro-methylene, if real, would be an extremely dangerous drug for consumption). The antics will prevent suspension of disbelief, and if the 1980's were really like that at college, then God help all those born with the savage moronicism of the almighty Alpha Betas running through their veins. The prevalence of this Idiocracy is supported by at least three sequels, none of which can be readily memorable.A couple of miscellaneous points about the movie (SPOILERS HERE) 1. They couldn't find a nerd who could actually play the violin??? 2. When they call for a nerd gathering, the first person to come was not a nerd... 3. The only way the nerds won were with the backup of the very masculine black Lambds. This, for all intents and purposes, ruined the point of the entire movie.

Anthony Edwards is a blast as his best pal Gilbert. He'd be reduced to a mere cameo in the second movie and written out of the 3rd and fourth movies altogether.

Upon arrival they quickly discover that people like them are treated different, when a popular fraternity called the Alpha Betas run by Stan Gable (McGinley) carelessly burn down their house they seize control of the freshmen dorm for their own. With no place to go the displaced freshmen move into the gymnasium until they find a place or be accepted into other fraternities. Joining our two heroes are child genius Harold Wormser (Cassesse), violin player Pointdexter (Busfield), nose picking Dudley Dawson aka Booger (Armstrong), Chinese exchange student Takashi (Tochi) and Lamar Latrelle (Scott). Aiding the Alpha Betas is their neighbouring sorority The Pi Delta Pis. Further complicating the situation is Lewis's developing crush on Betty Childs (Montgomery)a popular cheerleader, sorority sister and Gable's girlfriend.Two of my favourite scenes in the film include Lewis disguising himself so he can have sex with Betty in the fun house and the most surprising part is when she falls in love with him and dumps Stan then she declares I'm in love with a nerd.The other scene takes place after the Lambdas win the homecoming games and return to find their house totally trashed and almost destroyed and Gilbert finally decides he's not gonna take the abuse anymore and goes to confront the enemy.The ending was pretty awesome because this group of ordinary young men fought for their rights and won against the beautiful people, seeing everyone including Gilbert's girlfriend Judy (Meyrink) joining the crowd was entertaining. The song We Are The Champions fit that part perfectly.Other cast members included John Goodman from Roseanne, Donald Gibb, Matt Salinger, Bernie Casey, David Wohl and Jamie Cromwell as Mr. Skolnick. they delivered good performances.For fans of comedy and nerds out there I recommend Revenge Of The Nerds it's a sure crowd pleaser.

Fortunately, you don't have to be a masochist to watch Revenge of the Nerds, as it is not painfully bad. But it does help to have an IQ below 80. While I am not the world's expert on bad movies, nor have I read a scholarly dissertation on the evolution of dumb, dumber and dumbest movies, my guess is this paean to stupidity served as a prototype for subsequent excuses for inflicting bad scripts on the eternal adolescents. It lowered the bar for the minimum standard of quality for a movie and still return a profit, but there were even worse movies to come that lowered the bar a notch at a time, until it was impossible to make a movie any dumber without encountering the Springtime for Hitler effect. To give credit where credit is due, I guess it takes a certain amount of talent to deliver a nerdy performance, unless you are the genuine article. The trouble is, any resemblance between these characters and actual living, breathing human beings is purely coincidental. James Cromwell comes close to avoiding looking like a walking cardboard cutout, wisely stepping back a notch from hyper-over-acting. Too bad the youngsters didn't take a cue from this pro. Actually, Curtis Armstrong, Booger, probably delivers the only decent performance.And it must take a certain amount of talent to produce (I hesitate to say write) a script that never for a moment comes within 45 degrees of realism. The movie is almost plot-free, but does manage the stumble from one gag to another in an only mildly inebriated and entertaining fashion. OK, I will admit that I did laugh at some of the gags, which were presented in a deft fashion. If not, I would have rated this a 2. You can watch this and enjoy it, if you are in the right mood. But to credit Revenge of the Nerds with establishing a genre is historically inaccurate. First there was Animal House in 1978, though before that, there was Saturday Night Live, the TV show. Then there was Porky's in 1982. Porky's cost $4 million to make, and at last count had raked in $105 million. It was the original adolescent, sex, revenge movie. It was clever, cute, original and had good acting. Revenge of the Nerds came out in 1984 in an obvious attempt to cash in on this trend. It's made money, too, probably mostly because of all the teenage boys wanting to see naked girls. Hey, these are some hot bods! But there was nothing in the least clever about the nerds' revenge. It was all downhill from there. On the other hand, Porky's director Bob Clark turned around and made the classic Christmas Story in 1983 based on Jean Shepard's short stories. Not a nude girl in it. It is one of my favorite movies. My point is, in talented hands, you can make an adolescent movie spiced with sex and hijinxs that can work on multiple levels and have some quality and class. But I guess this is too much work for some directors.Porky's is far better than it's reputation. Heck, I would say it is a classic of its genre. Definitely a worth see. There is enough realism that you can imagine real people and situations like this.Yes, Revenge of the Nerds is amusing and not particularly painful to watch. But with a more talent and effort it could have risen to the level of being a good movie.

What makes someone one of each? Some say you're a loser if you're too smart, nice, and don't conform to the beautiful people's way of life. But most of us know that that's just ridiculous, not to mention shallow, and that it's best to be yourself and not care what others think of you. Even today people get picked on in school for being different, but they shouldn't let it get them down. That's ultimately the message in 'Revenge of the Nerds,' a film that the people involved thought would be something only a few people would see and that would end their film careers before they began. Well lucky for them and us it turned out to be one of the funniest and most unforgettable of comedies of our time.Pros Perfectly cast and acted. A concept that is both kind of silly, but also cool. Plenty of funny lines and hilarious sequences. Neat score and fun soundtrack, including a catchy title theme. Swift pace. Has a lot of heart and the characters come off real rather than as cartoon characters. Though not a movie to make you think a lot, there is a nice message here. A slam dunk finish.Cons Pretty dated now. Some stereotypical characters.Final thoughts The studio may not have believed in this film when it was made, but the people sure wanted to see it. How could a movie called 'Revenge of the Nerds' not be a hell of a lot of fun? Sure it's very 1980s, which isn't such a bad thing if you're an 80s nut, and pretty silly at times, but everyone had their hearts in it and it's just so much fun. One of those movies that never gets old.My rating 4.5/5 "},{"Title":"Rude,crude and raunchy but deservedly successful","Date":"27 March 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Rude, crude and raunchy but also consistently good humoured and almost consistently funny. This is a film that it is impossible to commend but whilst it should have sunk into oblivion long ago, it still has enough consumer appeal to remain readily available. In fact it is even well on its way to becoming a cult classic. The reason is partly of course that most of us enjoy any film about underdogs who are being abused by their more successful contemporaries but find a way to strike back and earn their place in the sun. None of us can hope for a continually successful life without setbacks, and such films provide necessary encouragement at these times. This was an early example, and it may even have saved a few unhappy young nerds in unsympathetic Colleges from suicidal thoughts. So roll on ROTN, continue to earn new DVD releases and to maintain a user rating that remains just above the unviewable range. - 5 stars is probably about fair.

The political incorrectness is hilarious for it's absurdity, and the fact that few people even blinked an eye at it then.

Hitler, too, had encouraged such bullying, to either weed out or toughen the weak, although I would have to give even if not especially him at least enough credit to where, much more probably, no such double standard would have been so piously, rancorously enforced, under his jurisdiction! . . . The physical education instructors, especially, were always emphasizing militarism, and encouraging their closest friends among the students to relentlessly pursue their favorite sadistic pastime, of systematically destroying the self-images of every nerd on campus, so as to feed off the condition of degradation which resulted! . . . Moreover, most females, who otherwise whine about brutes, are characteristically at the vanguard of this persecution; until it's hardly any wonder that so many males symbiotically cleave, sexually, to other males, where they can both play the female role, with relation to one-another! Many females also aspire to being men, while feeling smugly certain they can have it both ways! . . . Such cleverly amusing satire may, however, only succeed, overall, at unoffensively smoothing out too many of the roughest edges! Thus, for a much more grimly candid portrayal of the kinds of damage people succeed at doing to one-another, until it's sometimes vomited right back out, Charles Bronson's Ten to Midnight deserves much more scrutiny! Personally, I thank God, Unto This Very Day, that, Unlike Warren Stacey (Gene Davis), I Shall Always Continue, as I Always Have, to Aspire To Being An Angel!!!. . . However, it's actually James Dean, in Rebel Without a Cause, which is my own much more realistically normative Cup of Tea! I struggled, in school, and at home, with exactly the same problems! The details of what Jim Stark had to endure, internally, too, as the kind of person he was, were all very accurately portrayed, with relation to me; save, that is, for his most tragically climactic experience, in the middle, as well as the hopefully promising ending. Parenthetically, Plato (All Remember Sal Mineo, Don't They?), too, was a Dismally Unheeded Warning, Even To This Very Day, and Despite So Many More Of Them Now! Moreover, I Had To Experience What Plato Felt, Too; But, Again, Thank God, Not The Kind Of Thing He Finally Ended Up Doing!!! . . . Even My later experience, as Cal, in East of Eden, shall continue, Thank God (minus any doubt about what He Wills!), keeping me as intact as it did him, since I haven't yet reached the very end of it. But, as for Giant? I'm just lucky enough, at least, never to have had the money--or the racism!!! For another glaring view of this kind of problem, compare the difference between the Jonas Cord, Sr., of Brian Keith, in Nevada Smith, and Leif Erickson, in The Carpetbaggers! Consider, also, a very old man, in Amadeus, who never could quite grasp the answer to a question which had been perpetually in front of his very nose! Burt Lancaster's Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz, was a more valuable gift of longevity, bestowed by Woodrow Wilson; although Cordell Walker, Texas Ranger, wasn't so lucky with a little boy he had just about talked out of suicide, before the boy slipped accidentally and tragically to his death! Many continue to ask why the Lord, if there really is one, after-all, permits such senselessly wasteful tragedies to occur; while, at the same time, He's undoubtedly asking why almost everybody permits such expensively vital lessons to go no less thoroughly to waste! Kirk Douglas said it well, several years ago, in a television ad Prospective suicides don't really want to die, they just want to stop the pain!!! But as for Mark Twain's Sid Sawyer? There's real nerd, the kind who is just looking for trouble.

There is Curtis Armstrong as Booger and you'll never recognize Timothy Busfield as near-sighted Poindexter. Tormented by the brothers of Alpha Beta house, the nerds exact their revenge and the movie culminates in a puerile panty raid of the Pi Delta Pi sorority and the nerds' high-techno performance in the contest for best musical revue on campus. Big John Goodman is the mean coach. Revenge of the Nerds is a raunchy, brainless farce, full of ethnic stereotypes. All the jocks are muscle-bound and mean and all the sorority sisters are manipulative bimbos. Revenge has a totally unsubtle message, but it also has its funny moments. Revenge of the Nerds is a juvenile comedy where the little guy gets his and the jocks and sorority bimbos get what's coming to them.

It is dated, and one has to understand the 80's macho, old beer commercial perfect, women magnet type of guy attitude of the time.  Forget the Boy bands of today, the macho jocks would have chased these wimps out of the school dance!  Unless you had some slick political skills or played a mean axe (guitar for those not from the 80's) the top of the food chain ruled.  Talk about computers, bad dress, or social slowness labelled you a nerd.       Now the computer geeks rule in 00's; there is true revenge.  The movie like animal house looks very dated.  Animal house has been copied too death to the point that the shock value is gone, and so is the humor.  The heros of animal house are viewed as the jerks of today for whoever had their childish pranks pulled on them.  Animal house led the evolution for revenge of the Nerds, where the pranksters became the norm and picked on the nerds.  The dated part is where the social out casts get sympathy, where now a days people worry that the weird nerd could go nuts.  They have a Walton's joke that no one would get know, and a couple of the nerds would fit in today's grung or PC crowd.  The part that keeps this film on top is the writing.  What the nerds lack in social skills, looks, and muscles they make up in brains.  They get their revenge on the Jocks, with some dated non PC tactics that make me laugh.

Soon all the nerds on campus come together to try and fit in but it's clear that if they want respect they're going to have to destroy the jocks.

The humor is pretty much all over the place as we get the typical nerd jokes but all of them seem so fresh here. The stuff dealing with them getting kicked out of their living quarters is mildly funny but the real greatness here really picks up towards the middle of the film when the nerds try to throw a party and nothing goes as planned. With the help of Michael Jackson's Thriller, this entire sequence becomes one of the most memorable from all the teen/frat comedies of the decade. Everything from the boring acts to the eventual pot-smoking gives us one major laugh after another. All of this leads to the various stunts with the nerds getting their revenge and the screenplay is so well-written that you can't help but enjoy every step of the way. Another major plus are the performances with Carradine and Edwards really making their characters very memorable. As soon as we meet these two we like them and want to see them achieve their goals of being respected. The entire supporting cast is good with standouts including Curtis Armstrong as Booger, Brian Tochi as Toshiro, Julia Montgomery as the sexy Betty Childs and Ted McGinley who most will remember from Married...With Children.

Basically, all those movies are in the same genre misfits strike back and win the day. That's what it is. In `Animal House' it was a pack of college slobs; in `Stripes' it was Bill Murray and his gang of oddballs; in `Police Academy' it was Steve Guttenberg with his rip-off pack. Now, I'm reviewing `Revenge of the Nerds,' another comedy about nerds and how they conquer the `cool' people. Thank God this one is funny, and not another rip-off, i.e. `Police Academy.'As I write this, I have never seen `Animal House.' I know that to be a `movie buff' `Animal House' is a must-see, but I just haven't gotten around to seeing it yet; not having it at my local video rental store and the television companies never putting it on TV doesn't help, much, either. So, with that in mind, `Revenge of the Nerds,' is, to me, the best college-geeks/misfits comedy around  - perhaps even better than `Stripes' (though that is pushing it, a bit). After a bunch of nerds are shipped off to college, they are utterly devastated by the fact that they are picked on constantly (though I don't understand how that can be anything new for those guys). The jocks of the college ridicule them publicly, causing them to retreat to their college dorms.But now, they've had it up to here, and they are making a strike against the oppression.Robert Carradine leads a low-star cast full of geek-comedy stereotypes the loveable slob, the token black guy with `riddim,' the full-of-himself jock, the snobby (and busty) cheerleader, etc&#133; Fortunately, the characters are almost a pun on those of comedies like `Animal House' &#150; they don't take themselves too seriously. The actors have fun with their roles, and that's always good to see. Robert Carradine proves to be a good actor - not the greatest in the world, but surprisingly convincing. I'm pretty sure he's the brother (son?) of John Carradine; I think so, at least.The jokes in `Revenge of the Nerds' sometimes fall flat (the burping contest rings to mind) but the film manages to mainly stay on course with what it tries to do have some fun, and entertain the audience, while giving slight courage to the nerds of these generations.Along in the joke category are the pranks the nerds pull on everyone who ever made fun of them; they make a great array of booby-traps and pranks that would threaten even Macaulay Culkin's mad skills. The pranks are very funny, although a few get out of hand (the plate picture). Ask me why I like `Revenge of the Nerds' so much and I can't really tell you why. Granted, it's not a whole lot different (or better) than the ill-fated `Police Academy.' Still, it has some sort of `feel' to it that a lot of eighties comedies had and have, that just make the film worth watching. It grows on you. It's a bit like the feel of a campy movie, except for a comedy. I'm going to have to think of a name for this eighties comedy-film feeling. Perhaps I'll call it `campeight' or something like that. I don't know. I just know that `Revenge of the Nerds' is good entertainment.Before I bought `Predator' on DVD about a year ago, and before I bought it on video (yes, this has to do with `Revenge of the Nerds'), I rented it out on video in 1999. I had already seen it, of course, but I felt like watching it again. Anyway, before the film, there was a commercial where the camera scaled this decorated room with all kinds of gadgets and `nerdy' stuff. Finally, the camera came to rest on a chair, and the back of someone's head. Then, that `someone' turned around to reveal&#133;Robert Carradine saying `We're ba-a-a-ack!'I instantly felt both happy and sad.It was a commercial for `Revenge of the Nerds II Nerds in Paradise.' I must say that the commercial made it look good, but the sequel is just so-so. The jokes mostly fall flat, and are very reminiscent of the `Police Academy' films and their downfall(s). I just felt like adding this pointless paragraph to this review to tell you readers to ONLY watch the second film if it is on television. It is NOT worth renting. With that in mind, go see `Revenge of the Nerds' part I and have some fun. It's pure entertainment, and is very `campeight.' )3.5/5 stars -John Ulmer "},{"Title":"Not the 80's Comedy Gold one myth hope for, but still quite Funny,","Date":"27 July 2015","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Revenge of the Nerds is a decent movie with a fairly well developed storyline and a good comedic cast. It certainly has lots of great moments, there are many scenes that had me laughing out loud, it's characters all have very different personalities which makes for some terrific moments, the soundtrack is also fantastic, offering some pure eighties music. The film has the same problem several films from the eighties have, and that's that they forget about the story or set up of the movie on several occasions and just get carried away with themselves making jokes and offering slapstick images for the audience, this can get irritating at times as it will leave you wanting the story to move forward some more, also because of the constant comedy, it becomes hard to care and sympathise with the main characters. It's called Revenge of the Nerds, but I don't feel like the revenge is ever fully realised, even the ending dosen't offer a complete closure to the story and let the audience know that the jocks have gotten their just desserts and the nerds now reign superior, it wasn't a clear or fitting finale. It's quite funny at times, but I don't think Revenge of the Nerds deserves to be considered one of the great comedy movies of the eighties, but it is certainly worth the watch if you ever see it on television.

But 'Nerds' shows us that superficiality does not always prevail.But sadly, it does a lot of times. Just not in this movie, which is a good thing!And not just the 'superficial' aspect not just 'I'm hot'. There's this kind of violent attitude towards that which is different, and that has been going on in society forever. Plus the Alpha-Betas lying about various situations and 'playing the victim card'.All that said, I haven't read anything about how Lewis and Betty had become husband and wife for future sequels. But I may have just not paid attention. While I feel how Betty fell for Lewis was crazy, crazier things have happened. I did like how she pointed out how they fixed up their home to Stan.Now, is it just me or is 'Stanley' a pretty nerdy name?The Nerds also showed us how three-dimensional they were. The Alpha-Betas were one-dimensional and just liked to party and workout. The Nerds ended up being somewhat athletic, drank, had sex, got high, pulled pranks, and still had time to be brainiacs. And, as I said above, could be handymen.Remember, people The Nerds were the type of guys who ended up being successful and getting married. The Alpha Betas were the guys who after college were still hitting up on 18 year old girls and wondering why they're single 'because they're so awesome.Great flick, got mine at walmart for $5 and it's in my DVD player as I type this.Best characters were Lamar, U.N., and the Japanese guy whose name I can pronounce but cannot spell.

The Eighties were plagued with these mostly asinine teen comedies that pandered to male teens' baser instincts. The truth is some of these films were perfectly acceptable entertainment for their narrow target market but, compared to films of other genres, they're very poor quality. Animal House, which pretty much kick-started the genre, was the best of the bunch, with Porky's, it's bawdy, irreverent Canadian counterpart coming in second. Revenge of the Nerds could arguably be credited with a very distant third - but that 6.4 rating after 14,000+ votes seems way too generous.The story is the typical nerds vs jocks scenario. The nerds here replace the bacchanalian slobs from Animal House, but otherwise nothing much has changed the only classes anyone seems to attend is football class, and all the students are in their late 20s or early 30s. Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards are decent enough in the role of lead nerds, even though, apart from the original-for-its-day idea of having nerds as heroes, they have little of any quality to work with. All the nerds are stereotypical types, with only Curtis Armstrong's Booger really coming across as believable.If you're over 25 - and this doesn't form part of the flashback of your life - the chances are you'll find this a pretty bland concoction, with a few scattered laughs between a lot of misfires.

I think it's a time-capsule teen comedy when the formula worked and well. The film is based in stereotyping, but that is another one of it's appealing traits. It's easy for us who never really felt we belonged in the popular set to side with the victimized nerds for they represent the lonely-hearts who bask in the giant hurdled insult. The film, despite hurling those insults, engagingly loves these nerds and I think that's another key to the film's success. We can understand that without the wonderful performances from the cast portraying the nerds that this film just couldn't fly. The film is also so immersed in 80's pop culture that it is an amusing memory to dredge back up.The film shows the jocks as cretins pretty much abusive in every way. They step over the nerds because they deem themselves superior because of what they have externally than internally. We can see that they have to depend on what they have on the outside(brawn and good-looks)because the nerds completely overwhelm them on the inside. Carradine as Louis and Edwards as Gilbert are definitely the spark plug for the film and are so wonderful and likable, the material looks better. Then you have the gross-out jokes that worked well for Belushi in Animal House in this film represented by Curtis Armstrong's Booger who burps loudest and picks his nose the deepest. And, he can hurl one mean hilarious insult. His quips are the most funniest. Then you have Timothy Busfield as the elder Poindexter who seems to be the most clumsiest nerd of the bunch who sure has a hard time with the robotic maid. You have Larry Scott as the homosexual Lamar where the humorous gay jokes fly. Ted McGinley is the prick leader of the Alpha Beta jocks and Donald Gibb is The Ogre(who probably would be considered a nerd if he wasn't so massive). Then there's the oh-so yummy Betty Childs who is McGinley's girl but falls in love with Louis after she discovers how good nerds actually are at sex.There's this non-PC attitude that reigns supreme as full frontal nudity is in heavy doses and many of the jokes would indeed be considered offensive.

Nerds, the community of brilliance ostracized simply for their inability to adapt to societal standards of normal. The persecuted Nerds will continue to be shunned unless they can compete and ultimately overthrow their adversaries, the Alpha Betas (not really the Pi's since the sorority girl, Betty, eventually falls in love with Lewis). The Alpha Betas, headed by the jocko homos, are determined to keep the Nerds down, and can do so successfully because they run the Greek Council. So, they can get away with pretty much any pranks they play on the Nerds, who are just looking to get a fair shake. The Alpha Betas and, initially, their counterparts, Sorority Pi, are afraid that if Nerds are allowed to participate in the Fraternity system, they'll destroy what Fraternities are all about (jocko homos). I think Ted McGinley's character even says something like we can't let the Nerds in, they'll take over everything.The Nerds find help with a sponsoring Fraternal organization called the Tri Lambdas, an all-black Fraternity organization which agrees to take on the Nerds once they find out that the Nerds can fight back against their agressors. Once accepted by the Tri Lambdas, the Nerds promise to maintain an Equal Opportunity organization.After an hour and half of beers, college hijinks, and naked girls, the Nerds prevail, proving their worthiness following the climax at the Triathalon.

(Warning this is a spoiler.)That flaw is the following. This movie is supposed to make us feel that nerds are oppressed by jocks, and we are meant to see the nerds beat the jocks while not stooping to their level. However, I think that the nerds exhibit worse behavior in this movie than the jocks. All the jocks do is vandalize the nerds' house or insult the nerds. They don't ever, say, beat up the nerds. Nor do they sexually harass the nerdy girls. But the nerds go on the panty raid (maybe this is just petty theft, not so bad) and install cameras to spy on the popular girls when they're naked. And they distribute the naked pictures to the whole school during the carnival. This is ungentlemanly to say the least. But the cherry on the icing is how Lewis puts on the Darth Vader mask to have sex with Betty Childs. Yes, she's happy about it in the end, but what if she hadn't been? Do the ends justify the means? Lewis' behavior was deceitful and sleazy at best.The point I want to make is that, because of these behaviors, the nerds have stained themselves, and they are not really sympathetic characters, although we overlook it because they're nerds, overgrown children essentially. Would we turn such a blind eye if they were jocks? I think that the makers of the movie should have tried a little harder and made a similar film where the nerds had more moral fiber.

Thus, the movie shows how much time has changed. Despite these facts, the movie has aged very well.For a guy who was not present in 1980s and watched for the first time in 2014, I must say that movie has aged pretty well.After Animal House became a hit in 1978, many R-rated sex comedy came in 1980s like Porky, Risky Business and Fast Times At Ridgemont High. They were quite funny, but sometimes they took themselves seriously at a time. Seriousness worked flawlessly in Risky Business, but it felt mismatched in Porky and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This is not the case here. Sure it has all the typical T&A Teen Sex Gross-out ingredient like sex jokes, men peeking at naked girls, drugs, booze, partying, F- word, toilet humor and of course gratuitous frontal nudity,but the fact that movie never takes itself seriously sets it apart. The director of movie knew he was not making another The Graduate, but a very stupid comedy and he did not hide this fact with serious topics like racism(Porky) or abortion(Fast Times).The plot is very simple and you can guess from it's title. The title clearly specifies that nerds take revenge from jocks. Nerd represent nerd and jocks represent jocks. Nothing symbolic here. One of the best thing about movie is it 's character. Just like the film itself characters are slapstick and cartoonish. For e.g.; there is a character named Ogre, who behaves like Marvel superhero Hulk. Only difference is that Hulk is green skinned and has more hair. But the character that steals the show here is Booger. His role here is to be disgusting. Be it burping,eating dirty things or as you can guess from his name taking out his booger ! Booger is played by same guy who played Tom Cruise 's best friend in Risky Business and gave what the f--- speech.The movie is often accused of it's misogyny, but I am at movie 's defense here since a) movie is equal offender. It offends every one . Be it male or female,nerds or jocks, gays or rebels. b)girls were also nasty towards nerds and thus nerds had lame excuse to take revenge and c) it was 1980s.

More importantly, the story also has a serious subtext wrapped in occasionally hilarious social satire. Some such occurs in the climax when the carnival crowd rallies around the nerds. That's because the everyday folks have also experienced personal put-downs from our jocks and beauty driven culture. The nerds may have used their brains to outwit the dominant Alpha Beta's and Pi's. But the appeal of their grievance spreads to the carnival crowd who rally around them. Likely, the movie's real object is to affirm the worth of the non-beautiful non-athletic ordinary person. In short, those of us everyday types who don't appear on magazine covers or ESPN. Good!The fact that the moral is wrapped in an entertaining screenplay makes it all the more effective. Note how the spectrum of outcasts pretty much runs the traditional gamut from gays to racial minorities to social misfits. I guess my only complaint is making the nerdy Lewis more sexually compelling to sorority girl Betty than the blonde Adonis. The point is a good one&#x97; namely, that looks need have nothing to do with sexual performance. But, does the script have to cover every base and spread it on so thick.

As a big hater of Animal House, me writing this review begs the question why did you bother? The answer to that is probably because I liked the title. It has a fun ring to it, and I reckoned that a title like that should spawn a good film. While the film isn't essentially 'bad', it does have a strong scent of deja vu following it around, and while I aren't a guru on the subject of teen comedies; even I have seen the stuff in this movie before. It's got all the clich√©s, from all the kids getting stoned to the geeky kid getting off with the hottest babe in the school. The plot, as you might expect, is paper thin; and it follows the story of a couple of nerds that move to a new college and immediately find themselves at the mercy of a fraternity of football 'jocks', who see fit to tease the nerds because they're nerds.This film came to my attention after the nerdy character in American Splendor gave it such high praise. From the way he described it, I was expecting something in the way of intelligence and maybe even characters that you can identify with. I don't know, maybe real life nerds who went to college in America will find the events of this film similar to events in real life and will therefore find this uplifting or whatever, but for a non-American schooled, non-nerd; there isn't all that much to like. Some of the jokes are funny, such as the 'cool' nerd's poker skills against a less savvy player, but many of them are silly in a not-very-good way.

It gets worse. In order to win a college competition, they sell photographs of one of the women topless. It gets worse. One of the men tricks this same woman into having sex with him by dressing in the costume her boyfriend is wearing. This rape, is not simply treated comedically (like the other sexism), but the victim enjoys it so much she ditches her boyfriend and decides to go out with her attacker. The men involved in all these events are the heroes of the film. As nerds, the film positions them as the victims of discrimination and harassment from the jocks. As viewers, we are clearly invoked to desire and enjoy their revenge against their oppressors. Yet, their most extreme acts of revenge are enacted against the women. Women who are given little or no characterisation. These nerd heroes are mostly white and middle-class, yet they are constructed like an oppressed ethnicity. The fraternity they join is all black until they open their chapter. The climax of the film is a speech in which the central nerd declares 'I'm a nerd, and I'm here tonight to stand up for the rights of other nerds. I mean uh, all our lives we've been laughed at and made to feel inferior. ... Why? Because we're smart? Because we look different? Well, we're not. I'm a nerd, and uh, I'm pretty proud of it.' This is nerd identity politics, which puts their experiences on a level with groups who unlike nerds have the weight of social structures against them (women, African Americans, LGBTQI etc). This positioning serves in the film as a cover for misogyny.
