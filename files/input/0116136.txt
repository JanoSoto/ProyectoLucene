Draco, the dragon, was in my opinion a gorgeous creature and it didn't make it worse that he sounded like Sean Connery. ) Dennis Quaid is always enjoyable, a gorgeous man with an infectious smile. Dina Meyer is lovely as Kara. So what if some of the plot is not 'believable'. It's a fairytale. Anything goes in fairy tales. Heck, that's what fairy tales are all about. Fantasy, imagination. So, when and if you watch/re-watch this movie, do so with an open heart and suspend your disbelief and analytical minds. This is fantasy in the truest sense.

I still love this film...  I could talk about the top-notch special effects of the time and the inclusion of Sean Connery and Dennis Quaid, who performed their roles of noble dragon and despairing knight incredibly well...I guess I just did...but I think there's something else about this film that needs mentioning.Dragonheart is an incredibly uplifting film.  In a day when a lot of movies are chilling visions of the world around us, we need something to show us hope.  Dragonheart, with its tale of a knight who lost his faith and a dragon who was trying to restore his honor, paints a beautiful picture of kindness, friendship, love, and sacrifice that never fails to inspire me.  I am not a man given to displays of emotion, really...but the film makes me laugh and cry throughout everything.And the soundtrack certainly helps.  It is a textbook example of the proper use of a soundtrack to emphasize the plot and emotion.  The beautiful To the Stars remains one of my absolute favorite songs.  I can never listen to the soundtrack without seeing the movie happening again before my eyes.Get the movie.  And get the soundtrack.  You'll love them both.

Loads of these films have the good idea, but the bad production making it a very poor film. This is NOT the case in Dragonheart.For a film to be a success, you need to show as much goodness you have as well as badness. You need to have the equal balance of a nasty character that contains the exact amount of evil to comply with this.In the case of Dragonheart, we have the evil King Einon, demonstrated by David Thewlis. A fine performance to show how much evil can be inflicted by the control of one heartless man.Yet, in every film we have a hero, or in this case, 2. Dennis Quaid plays Bowen, a strong and faithful knight who lives in the service to protect others. Our other hero is the unlikely character of a dragon (Sean Connery and his lovely voice) named Draco. Between these 2 hero's, an alliance is made and they work together in hope of making peoples lives better.The direction, the acting, the costume and the characters all fit together to make this film be, what I believe, an amazing success. I know not many may agree to this, but I think, when you look deep into this film, you can see the true magic that is brought alive by the relationship between these two characters.In my view, an amazing film, an amazing cast and an amazing result.

But for me, it is great, for one big reason I love dragons. I always have. I hate how they are always depicted as evil monsters in most fantasy stories(this would be Tolkien's biggest flaw in my opinion). And here is one where the dragon is noble and kind! Sean Connery, by the way, has just about the best dragon voice there is(Gregory Peck might be a close second).Dragonheart may strike casual viewers(or the terminally unimaginative)as a silly, special-effects extravaganza; but, for people who love dragons, it provides something more.

A decade ago when this came out, I marveled, It's amazing how they can make strange creatures so lifelike. Of course, FX has only gotten better and better.For me, the dragon was the only endearing character in the movie. Dennis Quaid plays the good guy, but he's mostly annoying in here.

Dragonheart is not cynical at all, and is lots of fun for kids of all ages (why is this movie PG13?). If you're looking for a really ferocious dragon, Draco isn't it.  Draco is much more human than most movie dragons (if you want a scary dragon, watch Dragonslayer), but he is very realistic.  In fact, the scenes without him tend to drag, but Dennis Quaid's Bowen is strong as the disillusioned knight.  If you are looking for a deep plot, you won't find it, but that's no big deal.  Dragonheart is more about adventure and dragons than about plot twists and in depth characterizations.

In the beginning Bowen really loved the younger Einon and thats why it is quite painful to see in the first fight scene between Bowen and Einon (at the waterfall) that in fact Einon never believed Bowen's teachings of 'the old code,' you can see the sadness and realisation in Bowen, that Einon is 'bad' and was even at the beginning.Thewlis as Einon-brill-actually Thewlis is one of my favourite actors because of the 'brains' he puts into his characters-take Einon, for example-not outly strong, etc.-but you can see that this character thinks-he's educated he knows what he is doing. You only have to look at the scene with Einon and kara in the bed chamber-look at how Thewlis plays the character-using words, the ideas of 'power' to manipulate her. Of course, its a family film and he is generally a good 'badie' but luckily not a straight-forward, stereotypical one. I must say he gives one of the best performances in the film.Dina Meyer- this was one of her first films I believe and she does well-physically quite strong (which is quite a rarity to see a female who can stand up for herself in such films)but also adding a good character to assist Bowen.Postlethwaite- very funny-I think he's a great actor and I loved him in this-different to a lot of stuff he had done, especially before this film-the character adds a comical touch to the film-but also he just generally portrays a 'good' character.Connery-good, for the voice-you can tell the actor straight away and I think thats why he was chosen-but also I think his voice just adds something to the part.The effects-brill, esp. for their time-even now they still stand on their own and as a viewer you can just relax and freeze reality for a while and believe that a dragon is actually talking etc. on screen.Overall, a great film, that will touch the hearts of many-young and old. This is a film to watch over and over-full of laughs, fights, the odd tears and of course the classic battle between Good and Evil.If you haven't seen it before-rent it, relax, forget everything in reality for a couple of hours and just watch this great fantasy film.

I stumbled upon this movie quite by accident, but now that I've seen it twice, I'm pleased with this discovery. I'm not a fantasy or dragon lore enthusiast, but I found this movie enjoyable on many levels. Sean Connery lending his voice talent to the Dragon (Drako) is one of the most debatable choices in this movie. I personally think it was a good choice since I laughed every time I heard his English accent coming out of a medieval creature. The result? A dragon with a bit of sophistication and class. Also unexpected is the animation quality of the dragon. I expected that dragons would be something evil and harsh, but Drako ended up as an surprising character that was both funny and interesting. One scene in particular Bowen finds Drako serenading Kara by a waterfall. Upon discovery, Drako is embarrassed...well...as much as a dragon could.The story line is linear and easy to understand which leaves more time for the viewer to focus on other things. Dennis Quaid and David Thewlis do a good job acting, although the character that David plays (the evil king) is a bit dim. In fact, he is outright dumb which adds to the humor of the movie. Dennis plays Bowen, the disillusioned knight who manages to be gruff and tough, yet also remains light hearted about his duty. The plot partially follows the classic hero's quest theme. The plot at the end of the movie turned out the way it should have. Towards the 3rd quarter of the movie, I feared that some cheesy ending would take place since the movie hinted at the possibility of some silly conclusion where everyone would live happily ever after and the bad guys would get thrown in jail. Fortunately, the movie took the right path and a more serious ending ensued.This ended the movie quite well and I felt satisfied.I was surprised to see so many famous actors and actresses in this movie. Most of them acted well enough, although none gave any spectacular performances. Only one actor really stood out as miscast in this movie Jason Isaacs who played the evil king's side kick. After seeing too many movies where Issacs is cast as an domineering figure with composure (The Tuxedo, Black Hawk Down, The Patriot), his character in this movie was just too weak. At one point, he comes out of a house half dressed and accidentally drops his shorts (or medieval equivalent) for a brief moment. Overall, this movie was fun to watch. Drako was a surprise and offered a very refreshing portrayal of a dragon (although I can't compare this movie to any other dragon movie). Drako just seems to defy a stereotype I had in my mind about dragons. The cast is solid enough, and the story is one that is simple but interesting. The ending did the movie well. One thing is for sure, you can't watch this movie with a serious attitude. Its lighthearted and comical with a little bit of seriousness thrown in intermittently.

DRAGONHEART is a big budget, special effects-laden epic with some very neat CG the likes of those in JURASSIC PARK, perhaps even better. Thanks to CGI, the dragon here is no longer a clumsy puppet or a stop-motion animated character. The special effects creation here shows how fast special effects can progress over years and years of development. In terms of plot and characters, DRAGONHEART is only partial developed. The characters here lack more interest and the whole plot can't make it all good in the 103 min. running time.Ironically, the most interesting character in the film isn't any of the human characters. It is the character of Draco, the CGI dragon which also features another great leap in special effects, it's voiced by Sean Connery. Given Connery's voice, the character is very interesting and screenplay gives him more interest than any of his human counterparts. His sparing with the human character Bowen (played by Dennis Quaid) is amusing, even if his counterpart isn't exactly as interesting as he is.Other than Draco, the humans aren't very fancy. The hero, Bowen the dragon hunter, although played finely by Quaid (planting his tongue firmly in cheek), the script has not much to offer to him. The villain, played with a sly tongue by Brit David Thewlis, is practically an interesting character, but the script gives him less to do later. The great cast also includes Julie Christie, Jason Isaacs, Dina Meyer (from STARSHIP TROOPERS) and Pete Postlethwaite, all pretty good. The story didn't hold my attention for the entire running time. Perhaps its my lack of interest in the story that prevents it from getting into me.DRAGONHEART isn't unwatchable, not to the very least, but I must say I didn't actually enjoy most of it. It has a number of fun scenes with Connery's voicing of Draco as well as some pretty neat action scenes, but it ain't perfection.Rating **1/2 out of 5.

It could have been taken many steps further if the production team and writers genuinely cared about the film that they were making. Unfortunately, they weren't and could only be bothered in hashing together a quick and easy movie with no substance. I'm not sure what the pitch was to Universal but it seems like a bunch of C-list producers and writers felt like making Braveheart...for kids. Only with a Dragon instead of William Wallace.The plot is so simplistic that it really could be accurately summed up as 'bad king nasty to villagers, knight and dragon help'. Whoa, slow down, man. I don't think I can comprehend so much in a small space of time. Rob Cohen is hardly an artistic director but the action and framing are below even his meagre standards. There are some nice shots here and there but the rest of the film looks incredibly fake thanks to the truly terrible production design.When you take away all of that, all you are left with is a film with a CGI dragon. But in the 11 years since this was released the standard of such effects has improved drastically. Draco the Dragon looks just a little bit too dated, though he is still as cute and lovable as he always was.The problems with the film extend even to the extras. It's bad enough that such talented actors are given such rotten dialogue to work with (why none of them requested to tweak it a little bit is beyond me) but I am assuming that no one bothered to give the villagers in the background any instructions before rolling. You have no idea how distracting it is.Another potential thrown away is the religious element. I guess that no one involved in making the film wanted to offend any kind of faith and erased as much religion from the film as possible. It doesn't even clarify that it's set in Britain either. There are some flippant remarks to Camelot (conviniently just a few miles down the road from any point on the map) but almost the whole film was shot in Romania and the accents are all over the place, as usual.The one, major, plus-point of the movie is Randy Edelman's glorious score. It's the only decent score he's ever composed in his entire career but it's simply amazing. Well worth hunting down the CD for, I assure you.Dragonheart is just too tame and tepid to make any kind of lasting impression. There too many faults to forgive. It's better than Eragon, but nowhere near the beauty of Dragonslayer.

The story of a really annoying prince turned king who is evil and the knight who blames the evil portion of him on a dragon that gave part of his heart to save him is just not all that good. The highlight of this movie comes in the form of the fight between the knight and dragon and their subsequent teaming to help the dragon slayer make a little money. Then the movie goes south again as the dragon is captured and we have just a typical movie without the title character the dragon which makes for a very anti-climatic last portion of the film that ended about how you would expect it to. The effects are okay, not quite on par with a movie such as Jurassic Park, but the dragon looks real enough. I am guessing they tried to keep him out of the movie as much as possible to keep the costs down, unfortunately this hinders the film and it is not as good as it could have been.

A tyrannical king was ruling the nation, but his son Einon (Lee Oakes/David Thewlis) was being trained by a knight Bowen (Dennis Quaid) who tries to teach him the old code of the knights of the Roundtable. However, Einon is a very power hungry young man. During a peasant revolt Einon's father was killed during an ambush and Einon gets stabbed in the heart. His mother (Julie Christie) does the only thing she can do and takes him to a dragon who gives the prince half his heart in exchange that he is a noble ruler. But Einon quickly goes back on his word and becomes a harsh tyrant himself, torturing people and makes a massive fortress for himself. Bowen is angered, blaming the dragon for the Einon's corruption and swears to kill all dragons. The film then skips forward twelve years. Einon is still a tyrant and Bowen had hunted down every dragon, leaving only one. When battling the last dragon they enter into a stalemate, and the enter into a deal where Bowen and the dragon defraud people by letting the dragon scare villages and Bowen 'kills' him for payment. At the same time a young woman named Kara (Dina Meyer), a daughter of a rebel, trys to bring about another rebellion, but her calls fall on death ears. Its only when she is able to talk Bowen and Draco (Sean Connery) into joining the rebellion and train the peasants that they are able to take on Einon's forces.They are good points and bad for this film. The good is the special effects were good, especially for its time. The scenery was also very good and well done. The action and battle scenes were also good, but clean cut enough for children. Now the bad. The acting is poor. Dennis Quaid is not an action hero, and he did not fit the part. As well casting American in English roles a dumb move, and they don't even try an English accent. This was a tread in the 90s, Robin Hood Prince of Thieves had Kevin Costner and First Knight had the wooden Richard Gear. I don't like it when American play English characters. Dina Meyer was poor in this film. I personally think that Julie Christie and Sean Connery only did this film for the money.

We'll keep him visible as long as money allows, and tease you with off-screen cop-outs when we run out of money. In the end, when asked how the movie was, you'll say 'The dragon was way-cool!' and in doing so give it a favorable review.So that's basically all you can do. The movie is just burning time with everything else besides the dragon. They take a super generic and flat script about a last dragon and something about half a heart and fill it with semi-name actors and vaguely familiar faces saying unchallenging and easy-to-swallow lines of dialogue in an effort not to offend you before the next dragon scene. The sword-fighting was of the Swing at Each Other's Swords school, but you aren't there for sword fighting anyway. The red-haired chick from Starship Troopers beats up the big blonde guy from the X-Files, David Thewlis sneers, Quaide grimaces. All you're left to do is wait patiently for Big Sean's voice to start booming, saying all the best lines of course, since he's the dragon and the audience is paying attention when he talks, and he does some dragonish things and generally shows off his computer-generated freedom.

'Cause if Draco really was supposed to be a typical dragon of medieval times, then, believe me, extinction was the only reasonable answer for dealing with such a supremely annoying creature as this.Had the scriptwriters of Dragonheart just left well-enough alone (but they never can) and simply allowed Draco to be just a garden-variety dragon (sans the personality-plus factor), then, yes, I honestly think that this poorly-conceived picture might have faired so much better, in the long run.But, no, these narrow-visioned screenwriters had to go and make big, old Draco a beast who could be reasoned with, had serious emotional hang-ups, could speak fluent English, and, on top of all of that, they had him play the dupe in one of Bowen's shifty, under-handed, little schemes to fleece the gullible peasants out their hard-earned money (otherwise he'd order Draco to promptly trample all over their homes).This ruthless manipulating of Draco by Bowen was a perfect example of how this particular character operated. And it closely tied in with another aspect of Dragonheart's disappointing story that totally grated on my nerves and further convinced me to slap this film with such a low rating.Dennis Quaid played the Bowen character. And to say that Quaid was a royal pain in the neck would be an understatement of the highest order. This Bowen-bozo never stopped complaining about how no one, these days, was following The Old Code. This was apparently a strict code of conduct which dealt with a man's adherence and devotion to such things as honour, valour, courage and truth.And, of course, Bowen, with his starry-eyed allusions, blindly believed himself to be one of the very few gallant and noble men around who still lived by this rigid code of ethics. But the truth about Bowen (a real untrustworthy scoundrel) was that he would've gladly sold his own grandmother's gold-fillings from her teeth just for the sake of making a quick buck.All-in-all - I found this whole phony One-For-All-And-All-For-Me mentality that prevailed throughout Dragonheart's hypocritical, little story to be very, very tiresome, indeed. This frickin' pretentious Old Code business played hand-in-hand with some absolutely awful attempts at humour, as well as some pretty tedious and painfully predictable battle scenes, thrown in for good measure.As far as I'm concerned, Dragonheart was nothing but a badly-conceived movie meant only for tiny tots "},{"Title":"A Talking Dragon Makes This Movie Corny","Date":"31 July 2011","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" While I did enjoy this movie for what it is, I would have to say that this movie was corny.

Unfortunately to Bowen it seems that the heart turned Einen from a good, brave kid into a remorseless, evil lord like his father.It's your standard formulaic fantasy plot, essentially. Bowen is our brave hero, Einen our evil plotting king, and David Thewlis does a great job as the latter, he's extremely unlikeable. The twist is the characters along the way. Bowen joins forces with Draco the dragon and this is his 'heavy muscle' for the final battle. He is also joined by Brother Gilbert, a poetic monk who turns out to be a natural at firing a bow and arrow, and Kara, a peasant girl who has her own personal vendetta against Einen after he blinded and murdered her father.Dragonheart is an excellent film for all the great characters it brings together, and its basically simple plot makes for basic simple entertainment.

Draco looks absolutely perfect!  And who better to provide the voice than Sean Connery?  The instant I saw the trailers for this movie I couldn't wait to see it, and I wasn't let down when it finally came out and I went and saw it.The story is pretty good, and does a good job of keeping you interested.  Since the movie involves a dragon, you have to expect a lot of magical/mystical things to happen, and you just have to suspend reality for the duration of the film.The cast in the film is pretty good.  Sean Connery is the perfect voice for Draco, and he does a fantastic job with it.  Dennis Quaid pulls off a good performance.  Dina Meyer does a good job too.  Pete Postlethwaite and Jason Isaacs are worth mentioning as well.  David Thewlis is the only actor I'm a little unsure about.  His acting is actually quite good, but he just isn't a very threatening guy, so I'm not really sure if he is the best choice for the antagonist.  After a few viewings of the film I got used to him, so I'll just shut-up and accept it.I only have two major complaints about the film.  They are the following1) I deeply wish they would have shown one or more dragons other than Draco.  Don't get me wrong, I love Draco, but I would have loved to see just one other dragon in the film.  I REALLY REALLY wish the Director (Rob Cohen) would have shown the fight between Bowen (Dennis Quaid) and the Dragon near the beginning of the film (when they first introduce Brother Gilbert, played by Pete Postlethwaite).MAJOR SPOILER!!!  ONLY READ IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM!!! ...I WARNED YOU!!!2) The ending to the film was WAY TOO MUCH.  They went way TOO OVERBOARD with the mystical-ness of Draco's death.  Draco disappearing is one thing, but to then have his soul (which looks like a little ball of light) fly up into the stars and become one of the stars in the constellation of the dragon, then have the stars conform into one big star and then explode just to return back to their original places, making up the constellation again?  GOOD LORD!!!  WAY TOO MUCH!!!  Rob Cohen should have just had Draco disappear (in fact, I'm not even sure if I like the fact that he disappeared), and then show the stars and then have a voice-over while looking at the stars.  I think that would be a much more believable ending.Well, that's my two-cents for the film.  I really hope you enjoy the film as much as I do.  If anything, appreciate this film for the special effects!  They're superb!

In it, all involved positively froth over with enthusiasm and unabashed praise for the script, as if they caught religion. And why not the combined ouevre of director, producer, writer, and principal actors is, at best, suspect and unimpressive, so the need to artificially pump up this film (and their respective questionable resumes) is quite understandable. Only Pete Postlethwaite and the uncredited voice of Sir John Gielgud index well into the time and circumstances portrayed. Otherwise, the casting folk should be made to sit in a corner somewhere. To be fair though, their choices may have been limited due to budget constraints, vis-a-vis the special effects needed to justify the flick. And therein lies the film's greatest flaw things would have been far more interesting in regard to character interactions and situations if the dragon were left wild and dangerous (as in the vastly superior Dragonslayer). Instead, we have the dragon (in character, gestures, and facial expressions) overly anthropomorphized. The result is that anything mythic or mysterious (read intelligently interesting) disappears. What we're left with is a high-tech cartoon no better than, say, Pete's Dragon. Ultimately, the blame should fall on the director, Rob Cohen, for being so incredibly anal in his need to have the dragon be Sean Connery. With a voice so distinctive, it's impossible to watch this movie without thinking, Please, God. Don't let them slip in the 'Shaken, not stirred' line!.

There's a ton of medieval movies in Hollywood, the two prototypes being the grim, grainy, serious stuff and the lighthearted, whimsical entries. This falls splendidly in the second category, a rousing bit of sword and sorcery fun from beginning to end. Also, how can you say no to a movie with a dragon voiced by Sean Connery? You can't, that's how. You dig up an old VHS and wade knee deep into nostalgia for a couple hours, revisiting this treasure of olden times (by olden times I mean the 90's. Damn.. that was already over a decade ago). Dennis Quaid, sporting hairdo that would make Dog the Bounty hunter drop to his knees, plays Bowen, a knight sworn to King Einon, (a super young and decidedly nasty David Thewlis) who turns out to be a rotten bastard that wishes to attain immortality using the fabled heart of a dragon, which possesses mysterious powers. Bowen rebels and takes up with the last known dragon of its species, a magnificent creature named Draco (given the magnifishent voishe of Sean Connery), who happens to be the beast that gave half his heart to save the King years earlier. Einon now pursues them, sparking a battle that erupts into the third act with impressive spectacle. Julie Christie, Jason Isaacs and an invisible John Gieldud provide nice supporting turns. The late and very great Pete Postlethwaite seriously steals the show as Gilburt of Glockenspur, a spirited travelling monk who assists Bowen and Draco in their quest. The banter between Quaid and Connery spices things up so that we are just as entranced by their verbal collaboration as we are seeing them in action. Do yourself a favour and avoid the garbage sequel. Rewatch this instead! It's a gem.

Seeing it all these years later, it's clear that I didn't miss much; this is a film that plays out exactly as you'd expect, which is as ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES with an added dragon.The only good thing DRAGONHEART has going for it is that the plot is fairly unusual, setting up intriguing characters who go on different directions to those you might expect. David Thewlis is clearly going for an Alan Rickman vibe in PRINCE OF THIEVES in this one, but he doesn't really come off all that well, and Dennis Quaid's hero is typically dull. The interest comes from the supporting players Brian Thompson and Jason Isaacs are always welcome; Dina Meyer is feisty enough to get her the role in STARSHIP TROOPERS; and Pete Postlethwaite is great comic relief.The elephant (or should that be dragon?) in the room is Sean Connery, playing the voice of the dragon. He's pretty good, but the CGI effects are only acceptable in this one. They're fine compared to a lot of the usual SyFy/Asylum nonsense, but they're a far cry from the quality we saw in JURASSIC PARK. And Rob Cohen's direction is typically bland and soulless.

It's a relevant thought, you see, because as I browsed the reviews I came face to face with an old acquaintance -- the realisation that childlike wonder and imagination are actually rare enough to be in short supply, enough to justifiably call those resources scarce.I raised an eyebrow, vexed, as people complained about realism; I've heard complaints of the improbability of a dragon's ambulatory system without ever the self awareness to realise that with a few tweaks to physics to account for a different world -- one where magic exists as an institution and resource, no less -- along with some fixes to common misconceptions of dragons and animal biology that one could make anything probable. Clever people call this 'escapism,' a retreat into a fantasy, fictitious world unlike our own. Escapism goes so much further than daydreams of attractive sexual partners and fast cars.Here I see in the 'goofs' section that the dragon's wings don't generate downdraft. Who says they need to? A man in Britain created a box that could generate quantum thrust by manipulating lasers. Who's to say that a dragon's lift doesn't work the same way? Cries off realism come only from dull, mundane, typical minds. Not anyone who's especially brilliant would even mistake fantasy for reality in the first place. Truly, if one is unable to discern that dragon's exist in the realm of the improbable, so far separated from our own, then they've bigger problems than 'unrealistic' dragons.The pseudo-intellectual of below average intelligence complains of unrealism, thinking himself clever. The truly clever person possessed of a sharp mind and considerable wit finds the challenge of explaining other realities with their own physical laws fun!So, to wit, this is a lovely film, heartwarming, ingenious, and with a fantabulous showing from Mr. Connery. You may like it, but you should probably only watch it if you're clever enough to understand the distinctions and boundaries between reality and fantasy. Though individuals quite clever enough for that are evidently few and far between.Don't apply if you subscribe oxymoronically to 'I don't want fantasy in my fantasy, only reality with the rules of that even normalised and simplified into mundanity enough that I'm able to actually understand it;' Or if you're inclined to prefer bat-like dragon's over their six- limbed cousins because they're more realistic (without being erudite enough to realise why that statement makes no sense, because playing by those rules the ambulatory pressure problems created by such a large, flying creature would make bat-like dragons every bit as unrealistic). If either of the prior is true, you're not good enough for this film. It deserves a better audience.If, however, that gave you a chuckle rather than fired your ire, you may just be good enough for it. In which case you really should watch it!

His ugly ginger son takes his place but also gets wounded so he's taken by good knight Quaid to a Scottish dragon which can heal humans apparently. He is healed and made to promise he will be good unlike his father, well he lies and turns out even worse, didn't see that coming huh. This angers Quaid as he feels the dragon twisted the young Kings heart so he vows revenge on all dragons.The catch is that further down the line Quaid's knight realises that a worth while deal can be struck with the dragon for monetary gain. So they begin a partnership where the dragon scares the poor dumb peasants and Quaid rides in and saves them...for a few pieces of gold.So the film is set in olde England and does have a reasonable realistic approach in that sense, or at least they try. Problem being the film doesn't look anything like England but in fact looks exactly like where they shot it, eastern Europe. I did get the feeling that most of the budget for this film was used on creating the CGI dragon as everything else looks pretty poor really. This King only seems to be King of a small valley, there is no other mention of the rest of England or any other people outside this valley. His castle is pokey, he doesn't seem to have many troops, there seems to be more peasants than troops or even buildings to house them, everyone wears the same outfits all the time, the wigs are all obvious and hilariously bad and the film keeps circling around the same grassy/rocky areas over and over.The effects at the time were big, they were big time effects believe me, this film garnered much attention because of its CGI dragon. Looking back now its nicely done on the whole but obviously with time the cracks are now evident and the CGI shines through. There are some nice shots when 'Draco' is wet and when he breathes fire, plus the flying sequences are quite good but when he chats with humans it becomes a bit iffy. And yes Draco is his name, draco the dragon, surely they could come up with something a bit more original?.The idea of a knight and a dragon teaming up for a living during the medieval period is a good one but it doesn't quite feel fully serviced here. We only get a very very bare bones look at other peasants, other villages and how they go about this agreement. No sooner have we seen one badly interpreted village scam the plot goes off down this rebellion route against the evil young King. We then get a very very very average looking final battle sequence against...I dunno, about 50 horseback troops and about 100 peasants who were conveniently trained up in the art of war not more than a few hours before.There isn't really any decent lore in this film either, nothing on dragons much. The fact Draco can speak is hugely important I would of thought, it shows he is an intelligent beast, not just a dumb killing machine, surely humans could learn a great deal from this creature. I also want to know if all dragons can speak in this universe, they clearly have magic powers and possible immortality with a human, sheesh there is loads to discover here but we get nothing!. Why on earth would people wanna kill all these super intelligent sentient beings off?!!.It really does all feel a bit low rent...accept for the dragon. In fact the dragon is the best thing in the film really, Quaid looks bad in his blonde wig, Dina Meyer looks ridiculous in her peasant garb, Isaacs is wasted, Postlethwaite is also wasted but Thewlis is actually a decent slimy King...in a bad ginger wig. The choice of Connery as Draco is a good one, no complaints there, in fact its perfect.A fun cheerful fantasy with a surprisingly stirring orchestral score no doubt, but looking back its all very hokey and quite poorly made if you look closer.

The result was this lovable film that has, dare I say it, a burning passion.The story of a dragon (Sean Connery) and a dragon slayer (Dennis Quaid) becoming friends and teaming up against a tyrannical king is unforgettable. This movie is just full of comedy, action, and drama and the cast, especially Sean Connery, deliver terrific performances. It's not often you see a dragon movie like this and with that, it should be commended.I give this movie a 7 for entertainment value and a fiery extra point for the effort in which this was made.

Luckily it starts getting really enjoyable when the Dragon comes into it who becomes an ally of Bowen (Dennis Quaid) who is out to settle a personal vendetta against a Dragon who has turned a student of his into a corrupt ruler in his role as King Einon (David Thewlis in a very convincing role as an arrogant ruler).What makes this film appealing is the fact that the Dragon named Draco (voiced by Sean Connery) is given a lot of personality and hence is able to bond with Bowen. It adds a lot to the sense of humour and the film doesn't become too dark or a film that is based purely on revenge themes.The visual effects were also decent and for what this film is worth, it feels like a B grade film but looks like an A Grade film with the good performances, decent visuals and good cinematography of the landscapes. The production design is pretty impressive too.It still has flaws. The action scenes needed better music score to make it a bit more exciting and dramatic and the story itself is a bit cliché in some respects. Julie Christie doesn't have much to do in her role which is a shame considering she had a good presence in the beginning then was sort of here now and then later on. Dennis Quaid is convincing as a boorish Dragon Slayer earning a living as a slayer and is a likable character.What is also good is that there is no silly romantic subplot which I suspected would have been thrown in which would have made the plot even more cliché but it avoided that even though I thought there were going to be hints at it.So I was surprised to find myself enjoying this. Sometimes films like these that you can just watch and just have a good time are what you need when you don't want to think too much.

Einon's mother takes her son to a Dragon as a last resort in order to save his life, the Dragon gives Einon half of his own heart which saves the boy's life. Twelve years later & Einon (David Thewlis) has grown up to be just as much an evil tyrant as his father was who rules with brutality, his former friend, teacher & knight of the old order Bowen (Dennis Quaid) has turned Dragonslayer since he blames the Dragon's heart for polluting Einon & making him evil but decides to team up with a friendly Dragon he names Draco as well as feisty young woman Kara (Dina Meyer) who together lead a revolt against Einon, his troops & all he stands for...Directed by Rob Cohen this fantasy adventure is one of the few mainstream films featuring a Dragon & while it's nothing amazing I didn't think it was too bad overall. Dragon films are thin on the ground to be honest, there's Dragonslayer (1981), Dragonworld (1994) prior to Dragonheart with Dungeons & Dragons (2000), Reign of Fire (2002) & Eargon (2007) afterwards & none of the films mentioned have been that good or done that well at the box-office. The script feels a bit uneven, while on the one hand you have this whimsical child like fantasy of a friendly talking Dragon there's the other side of the film with a peasant uprising which does get quite violent with necks being broken, people being stabbed, set on fire & one bloke is hit in the nuts with a huge battle axe (ouch) & the two distinctly different tones didn't sit together that well for me. Basically the violence is a little too strong for younger children while the silly talking friendly Dragon is a little childish for anyone over the age of ten. That's not to say Dragonheart isn't an enjoyable film for what it is because it is, it moves along at a decent enough pace, the mismatched partners Bowen & Draco surely have one of the bizarrest on screen buddy buddy relationships ever & it entertains but I didn't think the violence & childish fantasy sat well together & it's a little repetitive & predictable with an ending that goes on for too long, sure the Dragon dies but have an extended scene set to orchestral music with various star shining in the sky is just a bit too much.Dragonheart was made early in the days of CGI computer effects & you can see a lot of time & effort went into them & they hold up really well even now. The battle scenes & fights are good if a little predictable (the good guy always wins & the bad guy gets it) & as a period piece the costumes, sets & props all look the part. Draco the Dragon voiced by Sean Connery looks great, he moves convincingly, flies convincingly & definitely has a personality. In fact Dragonheart was nominated for a Best Visual Effects Oscar along with Twister (1996) but both deservedly lost out to Independence Day (1996).With a supposed budget of about $57,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it & I would have though most of it was spent on the CGI effects, filmed on location in Slovakia. The acting is OK but nothing special, Pete Postlethwaite doesn't get much to do, Dennis Quid is somewhat bland, it's nice to see Brian Thompson in a Hollywood film while Sir John Gielgud has a voice cameo as King Arthur.Dragonheart is a solid enough fantasy adventure that may be too violent for youngsters while a bit too childish for adults, I thought it was good but nothing amazing overall. Followed by the straight to video sequel Dragonheart A New Beginning (2000).

In fact, it is quite a low fantasy movie with the exception of the dragon, which creates some of the high fantasy in this movie. Straight out, it is an enjoyable movie to watch, but it goes little beyond that.A knight is training a prince in the art of honour and chivalry, but the prince has better ideas. When he sees his father wounded severely in a peasant uprising, he does not help him, but rather rips the crown from his hand. It is this event that shows us that the prince is, in his heart, evil. Unfortunately, when his is wounded, he is taken to a Dragon for help. The dragon gives him half of his heart and the boy survives. Unfortunately, all pain that the prince (now King) feels is felt by the dragon. The king does not change his ways, and the knight thus blames the dragon.The movie hasn't got a straight plot, but it isn't twisted either. What it focuses on is the knight, who first seeks to kill the dragon, then befriends him, and then decides to destroy the king's power, only to become king himself. The movie does have a tragic feel to it, as we soon come to know that the dragon is going to die because of his compassion, but it is not the tragedy where we can see the character constantly degrade to a point where he will die. In fact, even though we know he is going to die, it is not because of his actions, but because of the actions of the antagonist, and though we see a minor flag that an act of compassion at the beginning will lead to his downfall, we do not know enough to want to warn him away from doing it.The theology in the movie is quite dodgy as well. Though human theology is not looked at, dragon theology is. The way the dragon reaches heaven is my doing noteworthy and honourable deeds. Unfortunately, if those deeds backfire then the dragon is in big trouble. As such there is no certainty and as such we can be as good as we like, but never be guaranteed because our acts of goodness might backfire.What Christ offers is assurance. There is no being good because no amount of good deeds can get us on the right side of God. In fact by doing pure good deeds we are saying that we are not happy with the way God does things and want to do it ourselves, and thus offending God. As such it is a vicious circle for we attempt to be good, but by being good we are being offensive, which is bad. As such being good does not work, but rather by trusting what God has already done. By dying he has given us the option of accepting that our goodness will never be good enough and thus take Jesus' goodness for ourselves, and his resurrection tells us that he had the authority to do it.As for the movie, it is okay, and pleasant to watch as a fantasy movie, but beyond that it is really not all that much. "},{"Title":"Intellectually weak, but entertaining in a Hollywood way","Date":"18 October 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":" Medieval loving kids, Dragonheart is the ideal film to capture your imagination. As you get older, however you quickly grow out of it when you recognize, that the plot is very Hollywood, the graphics are more dimensional than the characters, and there is no real acting, only play acting. I'm not saying that Dragonheart is a bad film, but it needs a little more.The story takes us into the Dark Ages, in the kingdom of King Frayen. His son Einon is being tutored by Sir Bowen who teaches him fighting, honor and the knight's code. In scene two, a peasant rebellion gets the king killed, and Einon takes a mortal wound. He will die if he is does not get help, but the Queen mother knows what to do. They take Einon to a dragon's cave, where she asks for help. A voice in the darkness makes young Einon swear to be a honourable king, on the Virge of death, the boy swears, and the dragon gives him half of his heart. His pulse is Einon's pulse, and when he dies, Einon dies. Twelve years later, Einon is an even worse tyrant than his father, and Bowen has become a dragon slayer. He blames the dragon for Einon's mischief. When He finds the dragon he seeks, they discover that they have something in common. They were both betrayed by the king and subsequently loath him. The two make a pact to work together. Bowen plans to lead the peasants in a battle against the tyranny. On his side are Cara, a girl seeking revenge for her father's murder, and Brother Gilbert who praises Bowen having seen him kill a dragon. There is going to be a brutal, bloody and fiery showdown.There is no denying that Dragonheart delivers what a good fantasy should for thrills and chills, but it is all part of a plot which has no sense of medieval history or realism to it. Even Dragonslayer, despite being occasionally hokey and with a much smaller budget felt more like the Dark Ages. Dragonheart feels like what it is, a Hollywood movie. As Roger Ebert puts it, it is at times a buddy film. He is referring of course to the partnership between Bowen and the Dragon 'Draco' with the voice of Sean Connery.For a pre-Titanic film, the CG is pretty good. Not only that but considering that the characters have to interact with him frequently it is even tougher for the Effects people to do their magic. What many viewers take for granted is that unlike animatronics, CG beast are never on screen with the actors at the same time. Bowen could be on his horse talking to a marker on a stick for all we know. It is in Post Production when the stick is swapped for a computer generated creature. It is tricky for the actors too, because they must avoid visual continuity problems.What else can I say about Dragonheart, it is a good film for people who like that kind of thing, but it is certainly not a film I'd show in history class, or if you want to impress your friends with intellectual film appreciation. Entertaining as it is, in today's day and age, it feels like just another piece of Hollywood fantasy movie-making.

Though the effects are still serviceable and impressive all things considered, it is clear that significant progress has been made in the years since. However, as the years have passed and the special effects seemed to fade... there are some respectable qualities in Rob Cohen's DRAGONHEART that might have gone unnoticed before.DRAGONHEART tells the story of a Dragonslayer named Bowen (played by Dennis Quaid) and the last dragon left on earth, Draco (voiced by Sean Connery). Bowen is a knight who is the main teacher of Einon, the future King. Bowen's goal is to teach young Einon the old code and help raise up a fair and just leader. When Einon is young, it appears that Bowen has set the young man on the correct path. However, when Einon first gains the throne he is nearly killed by a battle injury.His only hope for survival is to share half of the heart of Draco. Einon's mother the Queen (played by Julie Christie) bring her son and Bowen to Draco and plead for his help. Then, after Einon has promised to rule in peace and honor the old code, Draco heals him by giving the future king half his heart. However, when Einon grows older (played by David Thewlis) he turns against his oath to both Bowen and Draco by becoming a tyrant on the throne. The only hope that Bowen and Draco have of restoring peace to the kingdom is to join together as an unlikely team.Obviously the studios goal was to make this film all about the dragon effects, and while that might have made the film impressive in '96, it takes away from the pace in places. However, underneath the spectacle there is a truly compelling story here.The union of Draco and Bowen is established slowly and their relationship is well developed for this type of film. Much credit is due to the leading performances from Dennis Quaid and Sean Connery. Quaid really commits to the role and gives the character of Bowen a fire and passion that helps the audience buy into the relationship. Quaid's ability to rise above the material and be both charming and honest at the same time is proof that he should be working more. Meanwhile, Sean Connery conveys an aged wisdom as well as an aged wit in a vocal performance that was clearly a blast for Connery. Also, David Thewlis is entertaining as the crazed king. The women in the story aren't the focal point... and thankfully so because the performances from the females in this movie are far from good. Julie Christie seems to be phoning in her performance as the Queen... and Dina Meyer as the romantic interest tries really hard but is just a mess.DRAGONHEART is a light-hearted fantasy that manages to embrace it's silliness while still grounding itself with a well-defined central relationship. It's not stellar film-making, but it's certainly a worthy medieval fantasy (a genre that we don't see enough of anymore).

It *is* nice to see a medieval fantasy movie, especially one released the year after Braveheart, where not all is dark and sinister, blood and pain. There is humor here, and a positive message.Unfortunately, Dragonheart suffers from several problems.The special effects were pretty good; the dragon was seamlessly integrated into scenes, for example. However (and granted, maybe this is just a problem with my DVD or player), it seemed as though the animation stuttered, like stop-animation. That was distracting -- a disappointing sight in a film that came out four or five years after Terminator 2, which introduced fluid, realistic computer-rendered animation. The dragon reminded me of something from Harryhausen - it would have looked great twenty years earlier, but not in 1996. And aside from the dragon, not much else in the movie's effects seemed all that special, including the overdone ending.The writing and the acting, too, leave much to be desired. Right from the start, the situations and the characters' reactions to them are often just not believable. The dialog in particular often seems forced - especially that of the dragon. It didn't seem to make a difference whether the dialog was intended to be serious or humorous; it often came across as contrived or wooden. Connery has done better work.The combat scenes are somewhere above average, though some of the swordplay (presented as serious combat) echoes the fakery of the spear-catching scenes, creating unintended humor and drawing the viewer out of the illusion of the movie.The humor is generally satisfying (with some exceptions), and many moments *are* genuinely touching here, though I found myself affected more by the *idea* that Draco was the last of the dragons and less by anything that the story presented or that the acting did to evoke pathos. The scenes meant to tug at the heartstrings were mostly either overdone or simply fell flat.In all, Dragonheart is an entertaining enough movie - good enough for killing a Saturday afternoon, but substandard compared to other films of the genre. I felt my time was better spent watching the recent TV miniseries Legend of Earthsea, despite its shortcomings. The writing there was somewhat better, and the acting was more believable.G-5/10 average, but could have been much better.

One thing I realized at the first shot was that the cinematography looked like some pupils making a movie for a school project, and it didn't get any better. Though I enjoyed the twist of a dragon and a dragonslayer teaming up to fool some village people, the poor camera, editing, school theater performance acting and a lot of cliches turned this nearly-half-good plot into an unbearable thing to watch.The villain must be the most badly hair-dressed and uncharismatic evil overlord of all history; he looks like a not very intelligent child in the beginning, when he is in fact a not very intelligent child, and when he has become the king, he still looks the same. Huh, I'm scared! If he hadn't been introduced as the king earlier in the movie, he wouldn't stand out in any way from the surrounding people. Just his over-the-top stupidness gives some slight hint that he might be the antagonist, like inviting the woman who has just tried to assasinate him into his private chamber and even letting daggers lie around the place. Well, well, well, she has tried to kill me some minutes ago, then of course she wouldn't try it again, when I'm alone with her, without my bodyguards, would she? This can only be the thoughts of your run-of-the-mill, completely retarded evil overlord.And for one last thing that gave the deathblow to this sorry effort the voice of Sean Connery was okay for me, and I don't care about wrong accents and stuff, but... I mean... this is a dragon! It can't sound exactly like a human! I don't want to go into physics, but the dragon was much much bigger than a human. It has to sound different! It can't be that difficult and expensive to alter the voice of Connery in a way that it sounds deeper, fuller, like some three ton animal with a chest like a large broom closet should sound! Like I said, the visualization of the dragon was nearly flawless (especially for the time the movie was made), but this voice made it utterly unbelievable for me. Every time he spoke offscreen, I thought Oh, there's another person around, who is it? Ah, no, it's the dragon, yeah, right.All this may sound like just some minor matters, and I grant that a lot of minor flaws can still add up to a great movie. This time, they didn't.

I was touched in spite of myself by the characterization of the exceedingly handsome, tender, and nobly valiant Draco.  The idea of a gentle dragon is a welcome departure from the stereotypically vicious beast of myth.Quaid's portrayal of Bowen indicated to me that he's a much more versatile actor that I'd given him credit for, and Connery's resonant voice (a better one they could not possibly have chosen) adds immensely to the dragon's aura of strength, wisdom, and grandeur.  I had thought that I'd long grown beyond empathising with animated or computer generated characters, and yet, strangely, I found myself wishing the dragon were real, and even feeling sorry for the digitally created character as if it were.On a side note, despite the trend toward sequalizing movies, which so often results in the loss of their credibility, Dragonheart was one movie which left me longing for a continuation of its story.  The ending, though emotional and brilliant, left me feeling a certain sense of loss and disappointment that the story ended there.If there remains any significant audience out there that goes for epic tales of adventure such as this one, I cannot help but wonder if Dragonheart might be worth a second wind.

He writes his story to appeal to a particular audience...it could be an audience of children, or it could be an audience of adults. The film studio, however, always with an eye to have a bigger audience decides the film needs to appeal to both adults and children, so they require some changes so the film will appeal to both groups. But, in the end, it is too mature for kids, and too kiddish for adults, and really pleases almost no one. And that's a major problem with this film.On the positive side, the film is nicely filmed, and the special effects regarding the dragon are excellent. Also, the relationship that evolves between the dragon (wonderful voice of Sean Connery) and Dennis Quaid (which takes quite a long time to develop) is quite enchanting...yet also problematic -- it's a little too talkative and emotionally mature (not in a sexual manner) for most kids.On the negative side, close your eyes and listen to Dennis Quaids dialog when he's being forceful. I thought he must have taken speech lessons from Harrison Ford! Not saying Quaid doesn't do a decent job here, however. And then there's the mismatch between a little too much comedy to be taken seriously, and far too much drama to be taken as a comedy.As mentioned, Dennis Quaid as the knight does rather well. Sean Connery, though you only hear his voice as the dragon, is quite remarkable. I'm not sure this is a good role for David Thewlis as the evil king, It's clearly been a long fall for Julie Christie from Doctor Zhivago, although, as the king's queen mother, she has one delicious scene with her son toward the end of the movie. Dina Meyer as Kara, a peasant girl, is okay. And, you're right, that's John Gielgud's voice as the ghost of King Arthur.And, the ending simply ruined the film. Shameful and stupid.Some highlights, yes. But overall disappointing.

Visually, it really is a feast with nice sets, special effects and costumes. And the music is good too. But the story is not bad either. A warrior (played by Dennis Quaid, ex-husband to Meg Ryan) and a dragon stop fighting against each other, but instead decide to join forces against an evil king that was once saved by the dragon. The king is not physically strong at all, but sadly he is immortal, which complicates things a lot. Of course, there is also a beautiful maiden (Meyer looks super-hot here) and a loyal man of religion (Postlethwaite, rip) fighting on our hero's side. It's mostly a fantasy film, but there are many genres included here, even comedy. The initial encounter of Quaid's character and the dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) certainly has some humor to it. It's certainly a challenge for a film like this to be funny, but it worked very well when it did not take itself so seriously. The main villain is played by David Thewlis, a very underrated actor in general in my opinion and one of the best currently working without an Academy Award nomination. He made this film 3 years after Naked what is widely considered his finest performance. But he shines here as well. Looks like he really has a thing for villains although the way the character was written surely helped him in letting it all out, even down to murdering his own mother.Seeing as how there was only one dragon left, I suspected his death at the end and I was proved correct. I knew that there are two sequels, so I was a bit unsure, but in the end they decided to take this direction. I would say that this is the best film of director Rob Cohen, but I am not a fan of the likes of xxx or The Mummy, so I may be a bit biased here. The film's writer also came up with The Fly many years before this, so he sure is no one-trick-pony. It's difficult to name a favorite sequence as there are many great ones. The fight sequence near the waterfall was good, but so was the ending with the dragons turning into stars.

Bowen (Dennis Quaid) is the instructor to young prince Einon. In a battle with peasants, the king is killed and Einon is wounded. Queen Aislinn (Julie Christie) convinces Draco the dragon that the new king Einon follows the Old Code under the tutelage of Bowen. Draco (Sean Connery) gives Einon a part of his heart to heal the young king. Einon turns out to be just as cruel as the old king and Bowen blames it on the dragon's heart. Bowen vows to hunt down dragons. Twelve years later, cruel King Einon (David Thewlis) rules with the scheming Lord Felton (Jason Isaacs) and the brutal fighter Brok (Brian Thompson) by his side. Einon executes Kara (Dina Meyer)'s father after blinding him and 12 years of forced labor. Bowen catches up to Draco who is the last dragon, and they battle to a draw. They reconcile and decide to team up to collect reward from villagers for 'slaying' Draco. They are joined by Gilbert of Glockenspur (Pete Postlethwaite).This is generally a fun rip-roaring old fashion fantasy adventure. This is a movie of cruelest of villains and noblest of heroes. Even Bowen's quest to kill dragons is born of an outrage against the king's cruelty. This is not a movie of subtlety or complexity. It is simply a good dragon fun.

Considering the unbelievable popularity of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy (even today), we could ask ourselves why 'Dragonheart' didn't reach half of that fame. However, being underrated has a good side, as most underrated and less known films are far superior than the eternally popular and overrated ones.'Dragonheart' is an okay movie, worthy for dragon lovers. I am a dragon lover myself. Dragons fascinate me. They're such huge, fantastic and beautiful beasts. I wish dragons existed in real life.Draco the dragon is, without a doubt, the only really likable character in the movie. I don't care much about the others. The dragon is what makes this movie good enough. Without him, the movie would be nothing. The dragon is voiced by perhaps the most popular James Bond ever Sean Connery.Bowen, the character portrayed by Dennis Quaid, is a good guy but undeniably arrogant and much self-proud and at the same time he's a bad guy for one reason he kills all dragons because he believes that all dragons are evil. He wanted to kill Draco as well, but ends up forming a partnership and friendship with him and later realizes he's not evil.Draco was always a good dragon. He only killed those who wanted to harm him, in self-defense. What he didn't know was that giving half of his heart to Einon would be a terrible mistake. Einon falsely promised to be good and to follow the old code but in no time he showed what he really is a brutal tyrant who only pretended to be Bowen's friend so that he could learn how to use the sword.The sad thing is that, in order to kill the bad guy, the dragon has to die as well. This happens because, as they share the same heart, they feel the same pains and all. Realizing this, the dragon doesn't just beg to be killed, he demands. Bowen doesn't have courage to do it at first and you can't blame him for that. That is a horrible thing to do. I'd like to know if there wasn't any other solution. You know, like, maybe the dragon could have found a way to recover the half of his heart that he gave to the villain. That way they wouldn't share the same pain and the evil guy could have been killed without the dragon having to die with him.Much of the filming occurred in the ancient ruins of Spi&#x9A; Castle, Slovakia. The result is beautiful sceneries and landscapes, perfect for an epic film. The action is set somewhere in the late 10th century in England, after the Saxons's conquest of that country.The dragon might have been created by computer, but he looks great and very real - so different from CGI art. This level of perfection is comparable to the dinosaurs of 'Jurassic Park'.

I gave thanks and cried without stopping for a good half an hour. I'd never before cried so long and so hard, out of joy and gratitude at the same time.Dragonheart had convinced me that I too was worthy of being loved! The story takes place in the middle ages. In the film, Draco physically gives half his heart to a man who had just died and in doing so brings him back to life with immortality as an added benefit! It was a nice present, a very big one, very precious, and echoing what I had done the previous day.'My heart belongs to you', I had written to my beloved one.I gave her my heart&#x85; Not only words, not only a greetings card, I gave her my heart ! The striking similarity between my action and that of Draco helped me withdraw from the guilt trip that had began knocking at my door once again. What Sylvette had judged to be inappropriate was in fact a fine act of generosity.There was a great deal of childlike developments, of magic, and of the marvellous in this film. These kinds of things give me nourishment to grow and to believe again in the possibility of better days to come.'The days of dragons have ended', says Draco to the dragon-hunting knight at the end of the film when asking to be put to death.Draco had committed the unpardonable fault of making a present of immortality to a felon of the worst kind and to reclaim this there was only one solution, he had to die too. In order to rid the world of this pest, he had to sacrifice his own life. And in doing so he accepted his own truth, his place among the worlds of God. He was accepting the death of his physical body with serenity.I leave you with some great matter to meditate upon... 'No greater love hath no man than to sacrifice himself for another.'

The latter had better dialog, better storyline, equally good special effects. The only drawbacks I found in Merlin were with regard to casting, but Colin Morgan made an ideal young Merlin for me. John Hurt's voice made a more believable dragon than Sean Connery's voice.These fantasies are fun to watch when they are well made. However, I am always aware that the dragon is the biblical symbol of Satan. Therefore to make a noble beast of the creature is mockery of the Bible. Merlin did not exactly make the dragon a good creature - without the control of a dragonlord it became entirely destructive. It seems ironic to make any kind of pact with a dragon; it is literally making a pact with the devil. But as I say, the fantasy is fun when well done.

By sharing their hearts with us, they mean that they are ready to share not only our joy but also our pain and sufferings.For that time of the year, the creators have done an excellent job in animation and visuals. The performance by every actor was excellent. Sean Connery as Draco the dragon was unbelievable and awesome. The emotions expressed by the dragon are very good. Most of the movies show dragons as evil dark creatures. But, here the dragon is shown as a noble creature. This is a movie of a dragon-human sharing each others love, happiness, friendship, pain and care for each other. Both of them were betrayed by the same person. Both of them share the same pain. Finally, the dragon who shared its heart with a human gave its life to protect the humans. The story is well written. The musical score was awesome as they bring out our emotions very well. It's great film that will touch your heart. A film filled with laughter, action, feelings. An epic battle between good and evil. Buy it or rent it.

Such a reaction can quickly kill any tale that's meant to be set in the real world, but for a fantasy it's perfect, and in the telling of myth it's usually delightful instead of annoying if you can't believe what you see.Dragonheart is a family film that doesn't take its audience for granted at any stage. It's consistently funny, exciting and - in what is the most pleasant surprise of all - actually pretty moving at times. Who would have thought you could grow so attached to a cluster of pixels? - but the team of Quaid and Connery quickly make you believe. Throw in Pete Postlethwaite, who's always a perfect choice for a period film because he can play unworldly without seeming stupid, and all the right elements are in place for a rare good-time film that hits its marks.I particularly liked the role-reversal of a knight working with a dragon in order to outfox humans. It may seem somewhat elementary when it's laid out as plainly as I wrote it above, but in its transfer to the screen it pays off handsomely indeed. Both Quaid and Connery play gruff so well that it becomes a pleasure to hear their sparring exchanges gradually even out into a friendship built upon quiet respect for each other.For all its visual wizardry, this is a film that succeeds due to the efforts of a main cast who are all, without exception, excellent. It helps too that that they've been used in service of a story that has a detectable beating heart. A great big one. Here is a title that contains no lie.

This forever binds him to the creature if one dies, so does the other). Yet the prince grows up to become a merciless tyrant and Bowen roams the land to kill any surviving dragon in the hope of ridding the world of his perverted pupil... when he meets the beast (voiced by Sean Connery), they become unlikely allies.The wisely downplays most of the fantasy elements, grounding everything in a slightly sanitized Medieval reality, with the exception of the CGI dragon, surely a landmark at the time and a compelling creation not only is he believable within the context, he is cinema's first successful CGI main character, half a decade before Gollum and with less performance-friendly means. Credit then not only to Sean Connery who does a noble job, but to Dennis Quaid whose sparing with his CG counterpart sells the illusion.It is this central relationship - eclipsing some of the blander surrounding elements and performances - that really propels the film and makes it work not only for children but adults as well.

Also, the producers trowled the dregs of Xena-Warrior Princess ranks for every character other than Quaid, Connery, Thewless and the guy who played the lawyer in The Usual Suspects.The only reason I watched the thing is because Dennis Quaid has a knack for doing better than average movies.

Dennis Quaid plays a knight who is assigned to protect the young King but when injured in battle the King is taken to a wise dragon who donates a heart in return that the King rule wisely. The King becomes greedy and Quaid blames the heart and vows to slay every dragon he can, with the obvious one remaining. What are the odds of that? Eventually they form a plan where Quaid hunts Draco repeatedly for money before they attempt to dethrone the King. Story is repetitious with a ridiculous climax but the visual effects bring out that young at heart feeling. The dragon is a triumphant visual wonder voiced by Sean Connery who brings personality and purpose to the dragon's sense of worth. Director Rob Cohen has fun with the fantasy elements. Quaid survives as a knight who wishes to repair a wrong, but much of the acting is bad. David Thewlis as the tyrant King is straight forward and too juvenile. Dina Meyers is the obvious potential love interest and otherwise useless. The visual effects are the payoff and unfortunately it isn't enough.

Dragonheart should be taken with a pinch of salt, with a touch of humour and charm; this is a great Saturday matinée movie. With the sophistication of Sean Connery as Draco and the ruggedness of Denis Quaid playing the angry Knight, their role-playing has given us a witty and elegant movie, a nice mix indeed.The special effects are completely wasted, on the small screen that is, this is most definitely for the silver screen, and to waste the opportunity to witness Draco in full flight over the crest of the hill is tantamount to ignorance, a movie such as this was made only for the big screen. The fine colours and detailing of Draco's scales are utter craftsmanship, the use of CGI are apparent, but not in the obvious sense, but when used against the back drops of the open countryside, castles, woods, rivers and lakes the ending results are stupendous.The two leading protagonists, apart from Connery and Quaid, are the very charismatic English actors David Thewlis, as King Einon and Pete Postlethwaite playing Brother Gilbert of Glockenspur, and with an appearance form Jason Isaacs too. Both being exceptionally gifted, we have seen David Thewlis in the likes of the Harry Potter movies, Kingdom of Heaven (2005) and The Omen (2006), and respectively Alien³ (1992), The Usual Suspects (1995) and The Lost World Jurassic Park (1997) and The Constant Gardener (2005). These two actors bring Dragonheart out into the open, with their style, wit and ever-increasing personalities, not a line is wasted.With a musical score too from Randy Edelman, his work on Dragonheart is climatic toward the end; this is a moving and touching score.

The idea of a knight and a dragon teaming up was wonderful, and Dennis Quaid and Sean Connery pull it off terrifically.Just about the year 1000 AD, a young king is mortally wounded, and brought to a dragon to save his life.  But after the boy becomes evil, his mentor, Bowen, becomes convinced that the dragon did something to him.  He now vows to rid the world of dragons.The computer effects on the dragon (whom Bowen nicknames 'Draco' since the dragon claims humans can't pronounce his name in their tongue) are outstanding, especially as he is shown with human-like expressions and mannerisms.  Every part of him is well created, from his massive wings to the spikey crown on his head.This film is a veritable masterpiece among cinema, and is good for anybody that ever wanted to see a dragon as a good guy rather than a mindless beast. Watching this movie is truly a rewarding experience.

But that is all this film is, a kid's movie. It has everything kids need Monsters, swordplay, a pretty girl etc&#133;And as for all the comments saying it is brilliant and original, from what I'm assuming are adults; you have a lot to learn about film. The story was the traditional American buddy movie, which to me seems that to everyone else except Americans it is a tired and old concept. The problem with it being an American style movie is the American Director and Actors playing around in 'England' (in this case Slovakia). Also the 'American warrior comes to save the day' is always a sign of where the money comes from for example another dragon movie &#150; Reign of Fire.PLEASE Hollywood, if you are going to make a movie about England at least use English accents, even better, use English actors for the leads.Speaking of English actors, I find it hard to read some of these ignorant reviews on the performances of some of England's finest actors. Sean Connery, Jason Isaacs, David Thewlis, Pete Postlethwaite, these men are astounding actors. But as a professional actor myself, I know that your performance can only be as good as the director you are working with, in this case not a very good one&#133; sure Rob Cohen can direct a good action sequence (xXx, and Fast and the Furious) and has done work with special effects, but once again if your director isn't an actors director than you can't expect to feel any sympathy for any of the characters. I found it a struggle to watch these brilliant actors waste what could have been a half decent performance. Cohen managed to turn what could have been a quite epic story, into a shambolic buddy movie.So, Yeah, sure get the movie out for your children. But as for me I can sum this up in a sentenceBuddy comedy with dragon and an American who can't do 'English' in ancient England&#133; you do the math.3 out of 10  "}{"Title":"fun movie","Date":"13 January 2004","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  You can go wrong with sean connery as a dragon.

Evidently in fantasy movies dragons can remove 50% of their cardiac system and donate it to a human, granting him immortal life, at least","Date":"28 August 2000","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Fantasy","Review":"  Dragonheart didn't have much promise from the start, which is probably why it is not very well known. Or maybe it's just because it wasn't very good. Okay, it was a fairly entertaining movie, it had amazing special effects, but the entire premise was just asking too much, even for a fantasy movie. I am willing to accept the idea of dragons and dragon slayers, I'm even willing to suspend disbelief to the point where a dragon slayer might form some sort of twisted symbiotic relationship with the last of the dragons as a means of mutual gain, but a dragon giving his heart to a human? Come on, you have to draw the line somewhere. Besides that, Sean Connery was horribly miscast as the voice of the menacing but strangely lovable Draco, the amazing CGI dragon with the interspecies adaptable heart. Sure he's from Scotland so he didn't have to fake the accent (which Dennis Quaid didn't even try to do), but the problem with Sean Connery is that no other actor in the world sounds even a tiny bit like him. When I was watching the film, I didn't see the dragon talking, I saw Sean Connery standing in a windowless room somewhere talking into a microphone. That was the main thing that bothered me about the Dragon; other than that I thought that Connery did a good job as the voice of Draco.The biggest problem with Dragonheart, in my opinion, is that the story is flawed. Like I said, even for a fantasy movie, it is just too much to ask for the audience to believe that a dragon could (or WOULD) donate its heart to a human to save a life. Are dragon's really that compassionate? I doubt it. Maybe I'm just not enough into dragon magic and Dungeons & Dragons and things like that, but I was not too impressed with Dragonheart. Fans of the genre are sure to love it, though.

It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!), but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights, that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!

When I first heard the title of the movie, I was all like, oh, Jesus Christ, now they're gonna show some dull medieval-themed film with knights and wars.It was in 2005, when Danish TV2 decided to air the movie, and at that time I was absolutely fed up with anything medieval, because there simply was too much. But the name Dragonheart - particularly the part Dragon- made me turn on the TV set that evening and watch. Not that I expected much!It didn't turn out to be what I expected it to. Not at all. I expected it to be dull and stereotypical. Admitted, it was a knight movie, but what a movie it was! It was incredibly well made and the concept was impossible to dislike; the friendship between a man and a dragon. It's a beautiful concept. But it was not only that concept, that made me like the movie so much - it was also the humour of it, as well as the variety of events! Dragonheart made me laugh quite much - (Sean Connery as a dragon? Why not, LOL) - and just think about Bowen's air ride - and their little business venture. Not that I like the idea of dragon extermination, even pretended, but their methods to earn their money were hilarious. I cannot forget Draco saying, that the water is too shallow for him to sink, when he was supposed to look slain by Bowen..!!But not everything is to be laughed at. I won't go into further details, but there were places - especially in the end - where one could not help but being stern and sad. I needn't say more....and, technically speaking, the things in movie was also made very good. Everybody and everything looked as if it could have existed for real!I bet I sound very confusing, but it's not because of the movie. The movie is fantastic - much unlike my way of describing it!! The story has everything, that makes a good story - it has a message of friendship, and it is very warm and has plenty to be amused of, too! So if you haven't seen it yet, you'd better do so!

The knight and the dragon could not have been better casted with Quaid and Connery, and there are some hilarious quotes in the movie. And the bad guy is truly evil. Brother GIlbert, the priest, is also amusing; his somewhat goofy character manages to be comic without offending religious folks. Kara is, ironically, the least developed of the characters; her character is too one-sided. She's too serious, so in her case the one-dimensional aspect is not relieved by humor as it is with Brother Gilbert. The musical score is truly evocative; it's worth getting on soundtrack. Though the plot is basically straightforward, the fact that the dragon actually dies in the end is not apparent, though the possibility is hinted at by the dragon's own dialog and the early plot elements. All in all, well worth the $2.00 of renting.

Dragonheart is a great movie for its lightheartedness, action, adventure, comedy, drama, music and fantasy element, while Braveheart is great for its intense drama, gripping plot, great fighting, occasional comedy supplied by the Irishman Stephen and the Scots mooning tradition, and romance. Although one may think that there is not much difference, look again as yes, there is in that the feel is completely different in either movie. Its just one of those things where you love both but in different ways, but equally, because each one has its own high and low points.
