Now I am no prude, but in a day and age when young children are treated to scenes of wart hogs with gas (Lion King) or the sight of a dog hiking it's leg to relieve itself with a commentary(Homeward Bound), it is just nice to have something completely harmless for the little ones. I had to comment because this film deserved more than just to have a listing of In Memory of Waylon Jennings. This film is a credit to the wonderful creativity of people like Jim Henson, who put quality children programs ahead of the easier, poorly made childrens fare.Michael "},{"Title":"My first movie!","Date":"22 March 2000","Score":"7 out of 8 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Family","Review":"  This was the very first movie I ever saw at a theater.

Not only that, they attempt to create a film that is both entertaining and enlightening. For this reviewer, they succeed magnificently. There are many in-jokes, so to speak, in this movie -- anyone who has ever watched the show will laugh whenever one of the characters asks, Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street? and the normal audience of Sesame Street will still be amused by their favorite characters, while learning something about friendship and the meaning of family. Sesame Street, the TV show, was rather daring in that it showed black, white, green, purple, furry, and ... other ... living in perfect harmony. Except for Oscar the Grouch!And, speaking of Oscar, one of the many funny bits (this movie is packed with them, and all of the humor is safe for family viewing) is the Grouch diner. Look for Sandra Bernhard as a Grouch waitress. The cameos in this film are something else; Chevy Chase, John Candy, Sandra Bernhard, even Waylon Jennings, all devoted some of their time and talent to making this roundly enjoyable movie. And listen for the voice of Sally Kellerman as Miss Finch, the social worker from the Feathered Friends Society.Not that all of this movie is funny and light-hearted. There's a few sad moments with Big Bird -- I always get choked up during the One Shining Star song, which features a three-part counterpoint with Bird, Mr. Snuffleupagus, and Olivia all singing about Big Bird being safe back at home. And the Sleaze Brothers' scenes are thinly disguised cartoon villainry. I don't know if any of the Sesame Street characters have SEEN villains before -- Oscar is the closest they have, but he's just Grouchy. He doesn't actually hurt anyone, and the Sleaze Brothers start out nice and friendly to Big Bird.We learn quite a bit during this movie -- we learn that we should never order tossed salad in a Grouch restaurant, for example. We learn that it's never ok to jump from a moving vehicle -- unless we have Gordon's permission. And we learn our real home is where the people love and care about us. But, perhaps the most important lesson is that there are 258 fabulous credits! Hahahahahaha! (thunder and lightning sound here) And, from the filmmakers we learn that you CAN make a family film that includes the entire family (how many times have family films been suitable only for those family members still in diapers?) and refuses to preach? One of the many strengths of the Sesame Street characters is their ability to teach a lesson without shoving it down our throats. We never feel threatened or annoyed by these characters; we're always safe and welcome on Sesame Street.

I grew up watching these actors and Muppets. By 1985, I was too old for Sesame Street and would only watch it while waiting for my younger brothers to finish watching it so I could change the channel to watch music videos. I had a chance to rent it on VHS in 1988 but never did. After awhile, I forgot about the film altogether.Finally, I watched the film a few weeks ago and I realized I missed seeing a joyful movie that is free of the condescending tone and shilling that today's kids fare provides.Big Bird (voiced by Caroll Spinney) is forced to leave Sesame Street by some social welfare group for birds led by Miss Finch (voiced by Sally Kellerman) because they feel children-aged birds would be better off having adult birds and a bird family raising him than the more-than-capable human adults he has for his neighbors. After leaving for Oceanview, Illinois and unhappy with the Dodo family, he decides naively to walk back to NYC and when his friends back home get the Amber alert on the news from Chevy Chase, they all form several groups to intercept him.Unfortunately, the Sleaze Brothers (SCTV's Joe Flaherty and Dave Thomas) also hear the news and see Big Bird as their ticket to $$$. They are able to capture him and it's up to his old friends to free him.What I loved about the movie is that there's no talking down or condescending treatment of the audience. It's just a great children's film that teaches the importance of friendship and devotion to said friends. The actors don't try to change their personas. Maria, Gordon, Bob, Cookie Monster, Grover, etc. are the same people we saw in the T.V. show.The music, sadly, isn't very good but I'm So Blue, sung when Big Bird is captured by the Sleaze Brothers is an exception. When a painted blue Big Bird sings his sad song, you feel empathy for the guy. I doubt if Barney was painted yellow, anybody would show him the same treatment. It would be seen as the greatest comedy scene in Hollywood instead.While the movie is G-rated, adults will see some spoofs from various movies; subtle as they are. The opening song featuring Oscar The Grouch in front of a U.S. flag reminded me of Patton while the food fight featuring Sandra Bernhard (!) gave me flashbacks to Blazing Saddles.It's too bad the film faired poorly in the box office despite critical acclaim. If you can find a way to see this film and your kids aren't Elmo fanatics (he was nothing in 1985) they will enjoy it immensely. You can only then hope we'll revert to more of Follow That Bird and less of, say, Twilight.

The story is simple Big Bird is taken away from his warm nest on SS and taken to live with a ditsy foster family of dodo birds. Homesick and lonely, he sets off on a journey back home while being pursued by his friends, social workers and carnival owners.This movie is pretty much perfect, in it's own way. The all-star cast (a Muppet tradition) just shine and deliver sweet and likable performances with Dave Thomas and Joe Flaherty stand-outs as the bumbling villains. Carroll Spinney also delivers a heart-warming performance as Big Bird. In fact, there's not a dent in sight when it comes to this collection of actors.The story might be simple but would you have it any other way? When comparing this to the sequel, Elmo in Grouchland, this comes off like Die Hard which I consider an amusing comparison. My only real complaint is the forgettable songs.Overall for the kids and young at heart, this is a joy.

Working for the agency, Miss Finch convinces Bird to leave Sesame Street and move across America to live with the Dodo Family.  When Bird misses his friends he leaves his new home to walk back home - not aware of how far it is.  On his journey he meets many people, but several groups are out looking for him too - including all his friends from Sesame Street, a pair of circus owners and none other than Miss Finch herself.Sesame Street is the benchmark for children's television forever as far as I'm concerned - educational and entertaining, it did such a good job that it took me years of school before I stopped pronouncing Z `zee' and did it properly as `zed'.  This film version turns off the straight educational part of the service but ups the entertainment.  The plot is a good excuse for a freewheeling adventure that has plenty of laughs.  Big Bird's sections are a little slower, truth be told, but the supporting searches are very light and funny - Bird has to carry the message so it's fair it should be less funny.The message takes over the educational stuff and is a nicely put one about accepting differences and still being friends.  It isn't heavily made until the end, where the `with your own kind' argument is hammered home.  This is a little heavy handed but can be forgiven due to the level of enjoyment the film gives.  While not aiming at adults per se, the film has plenty for them - the humour never aims low but should be enjoyed by adults and children alike.  The funniest `adult' laugh is accidental and is where Maria turns to Sandra Bernhard and says `I'd like a tossed salad'!  Unintentional laugh of course as the `other' meaning of that wasn't really known in the early 80's! Sorry - I'm just twisted!  Outside of that the biggest laugh I had that kids won't get was the homage to North By Northwest's crop duster scene.The cast is great.  All the old Muppets from the street are here, although it may upset young fans to see Elmo sidelined to a silent appearance at a window but the rest are good stuff.  Bird himself is a little dry but the rest are very funny in small amounts - Grover, Count, Cookie Monster and Oscar all had good lines, as did Ernie & Bert, but Telly is kind of the Muppet nobody really likes!  The human cast of Sesame Street are cheerful and light - as you would expect, but it is the good cameos that spice it up. Chase has a great moment, Kermit reprises his reporter role but is clearly too big for this movie, Kellerman, Candy and Flaherty all have very small roles, although Flaherty has the best song.Overall this is a very enjoyable movie that is perfectly pitched for adults and children - without doing what Pixar do and separating the material for each taste.  The songs are not that great and there is at least one poor one in there, but the film has a fun energy to it that is wholesome but still entertaining and has great dialogue from start to finish. Love it!

It says Sesame Street, we see all our favorite Muppets and humans from the show, but it's the most un-Sesame Street atmosphere we've ever seen them in.  Even the scenes on Sesame Street are odd, because it's not the 'studio' Sesame Street, it's a much wider, more 3-dimensional area.  Theres no counting, singing of the alphebet, any of the things we commonly associate with Sesame Street.  It's just all the characters in a road flick that borders on 'action/adventure movie' with some catchy songs.All in all, it feels more like a regular Muppet movie, just with the SS Muppets instead (of course that transcending legend, Kermit the Frog, has an appearence).  It's cute, although I imagine some small children could be scared by some tense parts, it's long, but it's a pretty good movie.  I actually think adults who grew up on Sesame Street got a bigger kick out of it then kids, who will probably want Big Bird to start playing word games with them again.

It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor. Would you be mine?) and appreciated the way the film was made overall. It has a way of getting to kids and making them appreciate the parents and family they have, and it also has a way of speaking to parents and making them fully realize how gifted they are to have their children. The way Maria, Olivia, Gordon and Linda went on a wild goose chase in the middle of nowheresville, USA to try and get back Big Bird, even breaking and entering the carnival tent, shows just how muchof a parental bond they'd formed with Big Bird.I could go on, but they only give me so much space here.

I always loved them both. Big Bird gets taken to the dodos in Illinois, he does not like it there, so he starts walking all the way back to Seseme Street. Along the way, he meets a singing trucker who gives him a ride while singing ain't no road too long, and then he meets a couple of farm kids, who let him sleep in their barn, and then send him down the road while singing  easygoing . They also help Bigbird hide from Mrs. Finch, who's been after him to take him back to the Dodos. He even hides out in a hayfield while Mrs. Finch actually gets out of her car to go look for him. Lol. At one point Bigbird, while in the middle of a wheatfield whines  l'll never get home! There's nothing around but amber waves of grain. Directly after that, he has a nice imagination sequence of seeing Snuffy. Several of our familiar Seseme Street members drive out to look for him. Maria and Oscar, while together, stop at an actual grouch style restaurant which literally gives you tossed salad. Gordon and Susan go with Cookie Monster, who bit by bit, keeps eating parts of their car. And Ernie and Bert, who fly a plane, and at one point sing an upside-down song while flying their plane upside-down. Then Super Gover flies to go look for him then flies right into Gordon and Susan's car.  Grover!, Gordan and Maria both exclaim. That's Super Grover, Grover retorts. Then there are the two bad guys who run a carnival, steal apples from kids, and kidnap Bigbird, paint him blue, call him the  bluebird of happiness, and have him sing for a group of kids  to be back home again. But he can't get away, they have him locked up. My very favorite part of the film is when a cop (John Candy) pulls the two baddies over. He tells them that they are indeed in trouble for all that they've done, and then one of the bad guys actually starts crying. The cop says to him 'be a man. And the crying bad guy says I don't wanna be a man. OMG. That's all I can say. OMG. Well, that and that I don't think that I've ever laughed so hard in my entire life.

Unlike other Sesame Street productions it can be enjoyable for children well into elementary school, and even parents! All is well on Sesame Street, that is until it comes to the Bird Society's attention that Big Bird is not living with a proper bird family. They send out Ms. Finch, a social worker who is to place our favorite yellow muppet with a bird family. While nervous at first, Big Bird gets excited about the idea of a bird family and is sent to Illinois to live with the Dodos. The Dodos are rather dopey and strange, and Big Bird misses his friends on Sesame Street. Big Bird finally gives up on the Dodos and runs away when they say they do not want him to be friends with Snuffy, as he should have bird friends. When the gang on Sesame Street hear Big Bird is running home they send out a search party to find him, including Maria, Linda, Gordon, Super Grover, Oscar, the Count, Cookie Monster, Bert, Ernie,and the honkers. We then follow Big Bird's journey home to Sesame Street in New York, while all his friends search high and low for him. On his trip he manages to find help from some farm kids and a friendly truck driver, but also gets kidnapped by the Sleaze Brothers, two carnies who want him to be a sideshow attraction in their carnival. It is then up to the rest of the gang from Sesame Street to rescue their favorite yellow bird and take him home! I love this movie. It's something I loved when I was little and even if my daughter watches it over and over I don't get annoyed. It has a solid plot and is not just for preschoolers like many other Sesame Street productions. There is a clear positive message of the importance of diversity and even trans-racial adoption. There is also a good message of don't talk to strangers and shows the danger of trusting people too eager to get you into their car. While some have said this aspect of the movie is too scary, I disagree. It's far from traumatizing, and it is important that children have some level of fear of people who are clearly up to no good. Follow That Bird is both Jim Henson and Big Bird in their prime. It's definitely better than any Elmo movies, and a must for any Sesame Street fans, young and old.

(Check it on the Follow that Bird Wikipedia page) Maria said it best when she told Miss Finch at the end that everyone is happy and there are a lot of different characters living on Sesame Street People, Kids, Cows, Dogs, Birds, Bert and Ernie, Monsters, Honkers and Grouches.The one scene that really gets to me, besides the whole Blue Bird of Happiness scene is at the end when Big Bird returns to his nest and reunites with Snuffy, who he asked to watch over his nest.

Yes, it is a kid's movie, and is therefore corny and the such (they do break out into cheesy songs every now and then...), but it had a unique charm that a lot of B-class kid movies just don't have anymore. And while Sesame Street still exists for kids today, the newer stuff just doesn't seem to be the same. So for all of you out there like me who grew up on old school Sesame Street...I totally recommend you watch this movie....nostalgia is one of the greatest feelings in the world!

Follow That Bird is an emotional adventure starring Big Bird who is having all sorts of trouble trying to find his way back home after being forced to move in with some stupid Dodo foster parents. I was probably about five years old when I first watched it. My mom turned it on one day, and I have loved it ever since. I highly recommend this for the whole family. I still cry at certain parts. Great Movie. Definitely in my top five. Big Bird should have won an Oscar. If you have children, please do not let them grow up without seeing this masterpiece of children's entertainment.

If you have already seen it, you should see Big Bird in Japan or Big Bird in China.

It opens with a committee of birds deciding to place Big Bird in a bird home. The head bird, Miss Finch will personally see to it.    Big Bird is happy with life on Sesame Street. He's got many friends Luis, Maria, Bob, Linda, Gordon, Susan, Olivia, Grover, Cookie Monster, Bert, Ernie, The Count, even Oscar the Grouch, but his very best friend is Snuffelupagus. Miss Finch comes to see Big Bird and tells him about living with his own species. As much as he hated leaving his friends, Big Bird decided to go so he flew (on an airplane) to Illinois to meet his new family, the Dodos Daddy Dodo, Mommy Dodo, Donnie Dodo and Marie Dodo. The Dodos were real dodos. Not very bright at all.Big Bird finds it hard to adjust but the real problem is when the Dodos say Snuffy couldn't come and visit him so one night, Big Bird decided to leave this family and return to Sesame Street. News of his runaway soon spread. News reporters Chevy Chase and Kermit the Frog were on it. Miss Finch vowed to find Big Bird and stick him right back into the Dodos' care. Back on Sesame Street, Big Bird's friends make a plan to find him and bring him back. Bert and Ernie would take a biplane, The Count would go alone, Maria would go with Telly, Honker and Oscar in the Sloppy Jalopy, while Gordon, Olivia and Cookie Monster take the VW and Super Grover takes to the skies. Meanwhile, not too far away, a pair of bumbling con artists, Sam and Sid Sleaze, who own a carnival, are looking for something new for their show. They come into play a little bit later. Big Bird get's a ride from Waylon Jennings and plays with some kids on a farm; Maria and Oscar go to dinner at a restaurant run by grouches so you know it's messy; Super Grover travels with Gordon, Olivia and Cookie, who keeps trying to eat the car; Miss Finch is hot on Big Bird's trail, but when he tries to run away, he's captured by Sid and Sam Sleaze. They paint him blue and have him perform before an audience. Luckily, his Sesame Street friends find and release him. Sam and Sid try to get him back, but state trooper John Candy get's them first.Big Bird returns to Sesame Street and all is happy-- until Miss Finch pulls up. Big Bird convinces her he's happy on Sesame Street so she allows him to stay. So our story has a happy ending. There's an all- star cast here Joe Flaherty and Dave Thomas play Sam and Sid Sleaze. Sandra Bernhardt and Laraine Newman are here too. Like I said, this movie represents Sesame Street in it's good old days! There was another Sesame Street movie done about 3 years ago, Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland which wasn't nearly as good as this one! Perhaps you've noticed that Elmo isn't in Follow That Bird at all. Good. But in conclusion, this is a cute movie. I recommend it.

A social worker, upon seeing that Big Bird doesn't live with other birds, sets him up with a Dodo family to be adopted.Unfortunately he is not happy in his new surroundings, and runs away from home, trying to get back to Sesame Street.  On the way home, he encounters adventure with all kinds of people, and discovers where he really wants to be.  His true home, Sesame Street.I recommend it for Sesame Street aged kids.

Sesame Street has long upheld the notion that family is something which extends beyond blood ties into community, that diversity and difference is to be celebrated and encouraged, and this movie is a complete affirmation of that, delivered in a story a five year old can understand and appreciate.The balances and transitions between happy and sad, good and bad, action and stillness, are all perfectly handled. Almost all the characters are well used (except Grover perhaps) with Spinney as Big Bird as fantastic as always, allowing his oversized innocence to shine through, even in the face of the (perfectly judged) baddies.The direction and cinematography are great - though its just nice to see the Street on film (and actually outside?) rather than the studio-bound look of TV. The movie has hardly aged a day.The plot slides gracefully along, with a real sense of progression, a proper road movie. The four groups of characters moving in converging directions, frequently missing each other. The final scene is a suitably simple, profound, subtle but satisfying finale.To deliver all this in a way that is deeply satisfying to the adults and the small people is a massive challenge that Follow That Bird effortlessly rises to.

That was just one of many of the in-jokes in this film, that adults will appriciate and children will laugh at when they see it as parents.I first watched Follow That Bird when I was 3 years old. I cried my eyes out when Big-Bird sang, One Little Star  and felt empathy for him on his way back HOME to sesame street from Oceanview, Illinois, where he lived with the absent-minded Dodo's.  At a child's most impressionable age, such as 3 or 4,  this movie can do wonders.

The other gang decide to do the same thing, also that meddlesome Miss Finch, the culprit behind this mess. Big Bird meets a lot of new people, one kid mistook him for a chicken, He's an 8'2 6 year-old canary. It took a lot of effort and determination to get Big Bird back to his true home, Sesame Street. When that Miss Finch came back Maria(Sonia Manzano) tells Miss Finch family is diverse, and not discriminant. The last words from Miss Finch was Case Dismissed. No one will ever see that bird ever again. With all the characters there from Bert& Ernie, Super Grover, Cookie Monster, and who else The Count.

But a good question, should Big Bird live with his friends on Sesame Street or live with his own kind which would be birds, in case you have just joined us. Well that is what this movie is about.

And Big Bird's family is the dodos. When Big Bird says Why I'm Big Bird and a dodo says, No your not your Big Dodo.

Sesame Street is the pinnacle of utopia because it has a precise diversity quota. There are Indias, African Americans, Hispanics, a minority of Anglo Saxon European whites, and a diverse animal population.A group of birds come together under the premise that a bird can't possibly happening living with diversity, they must live with their species. They find a new home for Big Bird in and DoDo birds that represent Midwestern white suburbanites who are inherently racist, mentally inferior to liberal New Yorkers, and don't associate with other cultures in Belleville, IL. Big Bird does not like his new home as it is impossible for a dumb Midwestern suburban white to be happy.Later in the movie we white rural Americans operating a Circus. Whites business owners clearly do not mind ripping off children, stealing lunches, or abusing animals to pursue a profit motive. At the end the diverse group must rescue Big Bird from the evil white racist business owners. You see, businesses are inherently evil, and only the government cares about individuals. Thank goodness we have liberal groups such as PETA to go after circus owners.Your taxpayer dollars at work to indoctrinate liberal stereotypes into young children who can't yet reach their own conclusions.

I remember that he was also in China or some other country and he had befriended a little girl.

After seeing Kermit and Miss Piggy on the big screen many years ago, I was hoping to anticipate a movie with just SESAME STREET characters in it. Well, the movie finally came out, although I was getting too old in my ten years for kindergarten and ABC's. Seeing Big Bird going on a wild, yet odd adventure was a different experience even for the smaller tykes who liked and adored him. Bert & Ernie's airplane sequence was the best part, and that easily stole the show. Being young never had been so much fun! Now, it's time to face reality...I felt that making a movie out of a public TV program was a large undertaking. Combining musical songs with big name stars like Chevy Chase is one thing. While there are some bright and shiny moments as usually expected, there are two instances I noticed in the film that doesn't exist in SESAME STREET's light-hearted world. One is the fact that depression strikes when loved ones (including Big Bird) are declared lost or missing. Another is cruel and evil ways; the scene where two circus owners steal a boy's apple on purpose is a proven point there.This is considered to be something that's motion-picture entertainment, and not a pre-school lesson. Veteran fans will appreciate it, but the little kids are better off with BARNEY and TELETUBBIES by now. For collectors of SESAME STREET memorabilia, this movie should help add it on. "}]
