I'd like to offer a somewhat serious but very informal observation of this very clever, funny movie. We've got a non-Westerner (Hrundi Bakshi, played by Peter Sellers) trying desperately to fit into American culture. We've also got a young French woman (Michele Monet, played by Claudine Longet), who is also trying to fit in. Neither of them like or understand what they see. Hrundi seems incompetent, but when he's not bending to American society we recognize that he's really intelligent, intuitive, funny, and caring.As Hrundi wends his way through the hosts' gigantic house, he observes the pitfalls of the American way drugs, alcoholism, greed, deceit, vanity, materialism, sexism, and racism, to name a few. He also observes societal constraints. Michele sees these things too, and she is also the target of sexism and even, perhaps, of misogyny (her date tries to force himself on her and, later, demands that she leave with him or lose any chance of a film career). They interact with people who think they know who they are but, as Hrundi infers, don't really know who they are.The climax occurs when Hrundi demands that the hosts' daughter and her friends wash an elephant they have ignominiously painted (a representation of ideological protest gone wrong, since it's more for entertainment than for anything else). When they start washing, the party turns into a real party. Social lines are blurred as people in different social levels are equalized, for example, when some of the housekeeping staff joins the party. Constraints and boundaries are laid aside and forgotten. The American guests, a group of Russian entertainers, Hrundi, and Michele all join in and have fun together. Not everyone joins the party; the older Americans refuse to participate. But we get the idea that they and their ideals have been vanquished.In the end of the movie, we get a strong and uplifting suggestion that Hrundi and Michele are going to be spending more time together.Subtle humor, clever slapstick, romance, and serious issues -- The Party has them all in good abundance. The best aspect of this movie, however, is that it examines serious themes through masterful,unrelenting humor.

Instead of making his stereotype just a vehicle for laughs, he brings out the pathos and beauty inherent in alienation..instead of using scripted antique gags as an invitation to walk through the role, he transcends each tired joke with impeccable timing and facial expressions.

The film is just made by a group of gags -many are improvised-.We can see that Peter Sellers, a terrific actor, is also a mime -he can do whatever with the expressions of his face and his body-. For doing such film you have to have a very intelligent and patient director, who knows all the comedy's tricks and let actors play with a total freedom... Blake Edwards is an eclectic director who allows that.

Hrundi V. Bakshi urgently needs to be appropriate and polite (he absolutely CANNOT be impolite), but his natural curiosity and unfamiliarity with his surroundings wreak havoc.  He's really quite an admirable fellow, though.  He's unfailingly considerate and reasonable, but brave and resourceful when coming to the aid of another, as in the case of producer C.S. Divot's (Gavin MacLeod) exploitation of Michelle Monet (Claudine Longet).  I find it hard to accept the notion that the characterization is racist, as some contend, unless you consider the very act of a white person playing an Indian in dark makeup racist.  It can't be denied that many westerners find the accent amusing (see Baboo in `Seinfeld,' or Apu in `The Simpsons').  Still, Sellers' characterization of Bakshi is no stereotype, and I don't feel that his portrayal brings discredit to anyone.That aside, this is one damned funny film!  As `anonymous' from Chicago has pointed out below, there are interesting aspects there for your consideration, if you choose to look for them.  More than just a series of pratfalls and sight gags, `The Party' is a multi-faceted creation, as is its central character.

After the opening sequence with the Peter Sellers character wrecking a movie set, the bulk of the film takes place during the night of a big Hollywood party (which the Sellers character is inadvertently invited to). In this, the film is as rigorous as Antonioni's La Notte (also set during the events of one day and night), and the sight gags build and accumulate in a manner that is reminiscent of Jacques Tati (with the same melancholic humor prevading the slapstick). The film is utterly charming, with some acerbic touches pricking the hypocrisies of Hollywood, and the film takes the time to let the characters (especially the two principals, played by Sellers and Claudine Longet in her only major film role) develop.

Hrundi Bakshi (Sellers) is playing the main character of the new film production Son of Gunga Din, but he's little more than a series of accidents waiting to happen. He ends up ruining a set piece, which gets him fired. The producer of that film tells a studio exec to blacklist him. That exec accidentally adds Hrundi's name to the bottom of a party list. He goes, and, as you might expect, ends up destroying everything around him like a small tornado. Most of the film takes place at this party (and the film only really gets funny when Hrundi gets to the party), where we meet various Hollywood phonies and stars who are full of themselves, as well as a few innocent newcomers being beckoned to the infamous casting couch. All these people react in different ways to Hrundi, but most like him and see him as a nice guy who probably doesn't belong there anyway. He becomes enraptured by a young French newcomer named Michelle (Claudine Longet).Peter Sellers made a lot of films, and I have to admit that I haven't seen many. What I particularly like about The Party is the character of Hrundi and Sellers' performance. Sellers'	 films are usually very funny, but the characters are often just caricatures. I really like Hrundi. He could have easily been a gross stereotype. Sellers wears dark makeup to appear Indian, and he speaks in an accent. But Hrundi is not just a stereotype. He is a genuinely lovable person. He does some stupid things, but he always means well. I actually think the character would have been worth sequels.I am sure that Sellers and Blake Edwards were studying the French comedic filmmaker Jacques Tati when they were making this film. There are several scenes very, very reminiscent of M. Hulot's Holiday, Mon Oncle, and Playtime. Hrundi seems to be clearly based on M. Hulot. Of course, I am not accusing The Party of stealing or anything. I'm just happy that someone in Hollywood was a fan of Tati's films, and felt that his formulae would work in an American film. I wonder how well this film did financially. It's not well known at all today. One more note my Lord, Claudine Longet may be the single cutest girl I've ever seen! I don't know if I've seen her elsewhere. I can see why she didn't become a huge star. She's not imposing like others. Nor, truth be told, is she a great actress. But wowza!

Jacques","Date":"26 April 2008","Score":"5 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" It is a little uneven, but if you stick to it you end up liking this warm and fuzzy little film, the only Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers comedy without Chief Inspector Jacques Clousseau. Sellers had played an Indian before. In THE MILLIONAIRESS (1960) he was an Indian doctor working for the poor in London who attracts the world's richest woman (Sophia Loren). That film has it's moments (when the original George Bernard Shaw play creeps out) but this improvised film of 1968 is far better.Sellers is an Indian film actor who somehow was signed up to do a lead part in a Hollywood production called SON OF GUNGA DIN. Sellers' actor is playing this supposed fictional character (really fictional, as Kipling never wrote about his brave water carrier having a family). In the opening fifteen minutes Sellers demonstrates the wisdom of being hired by refusing to die properly (or is he trying to stretch out his deathbed sequence for the screen?). He is shot (while badly wounded) blowing a bugle call to the British troops about to be entrapped by the Indian rebels. Instead of falling down dead he keeps beeping his bugle again and again and again until the director tells him to stop it. Later he ruins a shot where he kills an enemy picket by forgetting that the movie is set in 1878, and Sellers is still wearing his waterproof wristwatch! Finally (I think Stan Laurel would have appreciated this) he ruins the one-chance-only destruction of the fort by explosives simply by tying his shoe on the plunger. Fired after the last (he asks the director if he can still do television), Sellers should be seen no more. But the director and the film producer (Gavin McLeod - later of MCHALE'S NAVY, THE MARY TYLER MOORE SHOW, and THE LOVE BOAT) call the studio President, Mr. Clutterbuck (J. Edward McKinley) and tell him about what has just happened to send the film's budget into the stratosphere. McKinley says he'll see the actor never works in the film industry again, and writes the name (Hrundi V. Bakshi) on a paper on his desk. Unfortunately, he did not realize it is a list of his guests for a fancy dinner party the next day. So Clutterbuck's secretary sends Bakshi/Sellers) an invitation). What follows is a disaster upon disaster improv. Unlike THE PINK PANTHER and A SHOT IN THE DARK, Edwards and Sellers approached THE PARTY as an experiment where they were creating escalating disasters at the dinner party that engulf all the guests. The escalating disasters is par and parcel for the work of Edwards' favorite comedians, Laurel & Hardy, for whom his slapstick comedy THE GREAT RACE (1965) was dedicated to.Sellers arrives at the party and quickly demonstrates the wisdom of inviting him. His shoe is muddy so he tries to nonchallantly clean it off in a pool (the clean water rapidly turns black) but the shoe floats away. Later, due to Sellers' ineptitude the shoe ends up on a tray of canapés being served. Still later, when he hurts his hand Sellers sticks it into a mound of ice on a table, only to find the caterer put beluga caviar within the mountain of ice. His real problem is he is a square peg in a round hole. He can't mingle and join the people at the party, many of whom have hostility towards him (Marge Champion, not dancing in this film, is the stiff wife of a Congressman who just never cottons to Sellers). He tries to laugh at jokes, not hearing them completely but laughing anyway, or laughing at anecdotes that aren't funny. In his curiosity he experiments with the pushbuttons of the living room, causing all kinds of odd, disruptive errors to occur. He even ends up feeding Birdy num nums to the host's pet parrot.Only one person is actually friendly to him at the start - a western film star, whom Sellers enjoys watching. They get on pretty well, except for one mishap with a toy dart gun (though Sellers isn't blamed for it). Then McLeod shows up with his latest protégé, Michelle Monet (Claudine Longet) and a second person turns out to be out-of-place at the party, only a French lady, not an Indian man. In the meantime the problems multiply during dinner, when besides Sellers the host and guests have to deal with a drunken waiter (Steve Franken - best recalled as Dobie Gillis' rich rival Chatsworth Osborne Jr.). The dinner reduced to a shambles between Sellers and Franken (including causing a squab to get twisted into a guests wig - don't ask), the guests do the best they can. I can't get into all the sequences - that spoils the fun here. One of the best deals with Sellers desperately trying to find a place to pee, and finding the bathrooms in use (once by Mrs. Champion), and finally using one in the master bedroom, that he causes a flood in, and even causes the band drummer to lose his drum (don't ask). However, one sequence actually shows that for all the confusion and destruction he causes, Sellers is actually pretty level headed. He confronts McLeod on the latter's miserable treatment of Longet, and shows up the former as a total creep. One recalls that with the other Edwards-Sellers stumble-bum, Clousseau, he is a walking disaster maker - but he is a first rate detective for all that.As I said, it is a little slow at points, and disjointed at times, but stick to THE PARTY. It is a worthy film for it's star and for it's cast.

However, this is a Hollywood set, so when the abrasive/clumsy actor stretches his on-screen role by not dying on cue, his compatriots....er....hurry him along.For 2mins, the specially flown-in authentically Sikh actor (played to perfection by the British comic who'd road-tested the accent in India) whines and squeals his bugle as he's repeatedly shot (more and more enthusiastically) by the frustrated cast, some resorting to a gatling gun(!)....and what Bakshi does later to an unsuspecting fort almost defies description. This may be THE most dangerously side-splitting, tear-inducing and fall-down-funny film prologues....ever.We then immediately segue through a single scene watching this destined-for-the-chopping-block actor mistakenly get invited to a snooty Hollywood party the studio head/party host, General Clutterbuck (his name hints what he'll suffer), first rages on the phone hearing his set was destroyed by an idiot, then distractedly hands his fortunes to his assistant. Bakshi's changing fortunes unfold via Henry Mancini's brilliant juxtapositional scoring. It first presents Bakshi at home playing sitar (recalling Beatle George Harrison's contemporary taste), then launches into Mancini's main film theme as Bakshi receives his accidentally posted Party invitation.This is an insider's spoof--a cinematic mugging of 1960s Hollywood--since Blake Edwards both improvises and lampoons so much of his own industry. With award-winning Mirisch scribes Frank & Tom Waldman, Edwards created (co-wrote) a knowing satire some Hollywood (stereo)types have disappeared, but the crass sexual leeches are still here. The rest of the film is sustained by Steve Franken's rare duck-walking drunk waiter (a decent homage to Charlie Chaplin), and Peter Seller's great precedent for Borat & Mr.Bean.Edwards originally planned a silent film with Sellers to honor silent-era slapstick, but the radio comic (Sellers made his career on British radio's The Goon Show) knew he couldn't carry the movie without words, nor would silent comedy play in a hip 1968 setting. The eventual screenplay, although looking as effortless as it was short (63pp), is masterful its 'incidental' early meeting between Bakshi and Janice Kane(Corinne Cole) establishes her as having the DTs/hallucinating objects in her glass (significant later), but it also hands Sellers a precisely observed joke as he backs away from her uncomfortably, realizing she's mental. Sellers' physical comedy, so precisely set up for him by Edwards, is predicated on Cole's verbal delivery as she insists in a raised voice, But I can see it!.This then is why a purely silent film would never have worked for Sellers.Bakshi creates havoc through many clumsy encounters with inanimate objects the house's bizarre electronic panel is a too-tempting toy; retrieving his soiled shoe from the pool proves increasingly ridiculous; and feeding the parrot with spilling seeds is best recalled with the catch-phrase Birdie num-num--now total lore for the film's actors and fans alike! My favourite is still the prologue, and Bakshi's battle with the (rigged) toilet roll/cistern....and the painting above. These scenes are screamingly funny, often going from bad to worse; with them Edwards & Sellers achieved a perfection of coincidental timing that is every bit as artful as Buster Keaton's. Everyone present compounds the evening's disorder. The Party soon becomes a veritable maelstrom of career-hungry Tinseltowners preying on one another; but Bakshi's match-made-in-mayhem turns out to be Levinson the drinks waiter(Steve Franken). Their yin/yang relationship emerges from Bakshi's inability to drink. Now technically, as a Sikh Indian, he should've worn a turban at all times as well; but it's Bakshi's cultural aversion that convinces Levinson to make up for his shortfalls. Our waiter gets so plastered that he waddles absent-mindedly (with precision timing) through doors and pools with all manner of trays, plates and chairs, driving his boss mad, but never worse for wear.Much of this slapstick is drowned out by white noise, simulating silent films--so Edwards still got his wish. His (actually) partying set used the same live band, which struck up (Ethel Merman's) There's_No_Business_Like_Show_Business every time their baby elephant (last 15mins only) needed the elderly janitor's shovel.The film's only false note is struck by the hostess, who goes into hysterics when encountering sudsy people from the out-of-control elephant wash. Her over-the-top nervous breakdown beggars belief.Conversely, the unheralded performance of the boozy blonde (Corinne Cole) hints a future with our waiter. Their spontaneous/scripted co-dependent sparks are courtesy of Levinson's insulation while gliding through neck-deep foam. He accidentally sabotages Janice's incumbent letch, transferring the man's bribe bottle to her, seeming like a sloshed White Knight. When she fights her way back to pour his drink, Levinson's wobbly lips lock onto hers in stunned/insulated gratitude. This surprisingly sweet payoff had the (unmet) potential to elevate the ending. It also qualifies Franken/Edwards as Master(s) of the Long Joke.Beyond Franken and Sellers, only Gavin MacLeod (Capt.Stubing of The Love Boat(1977-1987)) remains familiar. MacLeod plays The Party's funniest perfunctory (unsuccessful) sleaze--his name Divot(=pit) implying his personality. However it's the thwarted Divot who recognizes Bakshi and threatens to undo his good fortune, considering him meshugga(meshugganah, Yiddish for insane)--handing Sellers the funny retort ...I am NOT your sugar!The Bakshi/Monet romance probably won't succeed. While men read their awkwardness outside her building as full of hope, women recognize their fencing over a painful lack of commonality underneath their pretend-fencing over etiquette. Any future as a couple is bleak he's virtually unemployable as the idiot(....headed back to India), but while The Party's on, none of us have to face the music.The ending could have reflected Franken's contribution better, but The Party is a superbly hilarious time in the hip 1960s.For more production stories please consult John Cork's terrific DVD-supplements.(8/10) "},{"Title":"Laugh until tears rolled down both cheeks.","Date":"31 August 2009","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" I saw this when it first came out and I remember liking it but wondered if there wasn't something more. Like some of the more undervalued films of the era they were held to an unreasonably high standard. Some of the more regarded films have aged rather badly while others which disappointed have held up rather better.Watching THE PARTY the other night I found myself laughing out loud alone in a room. The toilet scene had me uncontrollably. There is no plot of course, just a series of sight gags. It's a throwback to the Mack Sennet days. You arrived at a location with some notes and started filming and saw what happened. Comedy was built and not written out. Some gags are planned but it was incumbent on the artist to build on them. In this case the artist was the comedian-Peter Sellers. The director was more or less the enabler.Sellers does the entire film in a slightly broad Indian accent but while he is a pratt he's not a total idiot. He is moral and without a mean bone in his body. He's just a clumsy screw up and what else would you want for a comedy? Of course he was responsible for more bad pseudo-Indian accents than anyone else in history.And Steve Franken is superb in support as the drunken waiter, a classic comedy part, known as a pi55 act in English Music Hall. This is one of the classical touches Edwards uses. There are more than a few hints that this film is something of an answer to Jacque Tati's sublime PLAY TIME (1967) where instead of making a film on a bespoke set the size of a small city it is done on a single sound stage.The rest is just for laughs. No message, no lesson. Just comedy tonight.And one irony, The Good Girl, Claudine Longet, who needs to be protected from evil old Mr. Divot (!) the lecherous producer (are there any other kind) played by the follicularly devious Gavin MacLeod, was later tried for shooting to death ski star Spider Savitch.

He is heard calling a game on the radio while Sellers' character, Hrundi V. Bakshi, is looking for a restroom. Scully was quite pleased about this, glowing in fact, and I was able to walk away knowing I scored a point with the Hall of Famer.The Party is the kind of pleasure that keeps delivering, in ways big and small. Reading the many reviews here about how sidesplitting the film is for them makes me a little jealous, because the comedy isn't all that for me. It's funny, yes, but it works for me more as a good-hearted film about people without much of a chance in life finding strength and purpose in each other.The key line in the movie for me is when Bakshi, standing up for a pretty girl, is confronted by a nasty producer played effectively by Gavin MacLeod. Who do you think you are? the producer demands.In India, we don't think who we are, we KNOW who we are! Bakshi counters. It's Bakshi's one great stand-up moment in a film which shows him taking pratfall after pratfall, and evidences his secret strength against all the derision around him He has integrity.So does the girl, as played by Claudine Longet, later famous for giving the Rolling Stones the inspiration for one of their classic bootleg songs after she shot and killed her skier lover. Longet is not really a looker in my book, only mildly pretty, but she has great charm and provides Bakshi with a measure of validation in the way she appreciates him and champions him after everything else in her life crashes down. Nothing To Lose, she sings, a great Henry Mancini song that offers ironic counterpoint since she has much to lose in one sense, trying to get her big break, but not in the sense that she is willing to sacrifice her integrity for it.The Party isn't an easy film to describe. Bakshi is accidentally invited to a party, where he finds himself very much a fish out of water. Polite to a fault, he tries to make himself inconspicuous and fails, making a mess of the living room and rocketing a Cornish game hen onto a woman's wig. People walk all over him, but he takes it in stride. When a cowboy star named Wyoming Bill Kelso gives him a painful handshake, Bakshi grins and says he would have been disappointed if Kelso hadn't crushed his hand.The film just ambles along, in its charming way, bathing us in its West Coast '60s ambiance and making us feel like we are watching a very silly festivity go down in real time. The feeling of the film is note-perfect, even when the jokes are labored. We get a sense of a multitude of characters, including a dancing model, a dipso waiter, a frustrated host, and many others, many of whom are only glimpsed in the background and give the film a real sense of being lived rather than acted.Sellers shines as Bakshi, because he manages to give us a character we can really care about even as we laugh at his misadventures. It would be easy to simply have made Bakshi the butt of every situation, but sometimes he's the bystander while others create the craziness, and other times he manages with a sly smile to turn a potentially hazardous situation to his advantage.The Party may be a great example of the virtue of keeping a good attitude about life, and in realizing how much more important it is to be true to yourself than conform to others' expectations. Wisdom is the province of the aged, but the heart of a child is pure, he says, before admitting he doesn't really know what it means. But watching The Party, I think we get a pretty good idea what he meant.

I wish I could recommend this movie more ethusiastically.  It has Peter Sellers during his best period, Blake Edwards in his metier, a properly comic setting, symbols of its times such as painted elephants. Painted elephants???Well, that's the sort of thing that dampens my enthusiasm.  One painted elephant in a comedy like this is one painted elephant too many.There is only enough dialogue to link the episodes together.  There are only a few verbal gags, most of the comedy is physical, so one thinks of Jacques Tati immediately and the association is justified.  Sellers is a clumsy Auslander invited by error to a Hollywood party attended mostly by rather stuffy people.  (He's an Indian for no discernible reason except that it gives Sellers a chance to show us he can do a Hindi accent.)  Like Tati he blunders all over the place, meaning no harm.  He slides off pebbled roofs, falls into swimming pools, sticks his hand into a container of caviar, messes with the electronic controls and causes a pissing mannequin to drench the back of a lady's expensive dress, flips a roast squab onto another woman's elegantly piled hair, and so forth.  Come to think of it, the movie owes a lot to The Pink Panther too.  Inspector Clouseau goes to a party.All or most of these episodes ought to be hilarious but somehow they seem more silly than anything else.  In The Pink Panther Clouseau hangs his trench coat out of sight in a closet and we hear it slide to the floor. It's amusing, since it's consistent with the other things that happen to him.  Most of the jokes in The Party reach that level.  Amusing.  But nothing as outrageous as the scene in Panther in which Clouseau asks his sleepless wife if she'd like him to do that special thing for her that always relaxes her -- then in the darkness we hear him begin to play a squeaky violin.  Or the scene in which R. J. Wagner hides in the bathtub and emerges wearing a sweater that now droops down around his ankles.  It's as if The Party is made up of a list of weaker gags that had been left out of Panther.  When the host's gawky girl shows up with her hippie friends and a juvenile elephant painted with flower power slogans, which must then be washed off in the swimming pool so that everyone can jump in and splash around in the foam, things get stretched pretty far.  And the arrival of the Russian band seems like desperation, a chance to play frantic Russian music.But if it's silly it's also distracting and has its moments.  These are aided by the performances.  The cigar-smoking host -- Clutterbuck? -- is perfect as Sellers tries to formally apologize to him for some gaffe. Clutterbuck is engaged in a polite conversation with another guest while being pestered from behind by Sellers.  He repeatedly turns to Sellers trying to dismiss him -- Pefectly all right.  Happens all the time. Forget about it.  Just have a good time.  And Clutterbuck does all this in a gruff, matter-of-fact voice, without expression, one hundred percent straight, while puffing his pre-Castro cigar.  Carol Wayne, a bouffant blonde, looks like a living Barbie doll.  (What a shame.)  Claudine Longet has the wispy voice and equally wispy manner of a gamine.  (Ditto.)  Most of the other actors are more important because of the way they look than because of anything they do.  The monstrous cowboy figure looks great but doesn't do or say anything amusing.  The drunken waiter has his moments. I enjoyed Hank Mancini's music though, a simple quartet led by a velvety tenor saxophone.  Oh, I know it's not jazz in any pure sense, but who cares?  It sounds relatively sophisticated and is fun to listen to, as opposed, say, to a pianist playing Liebestraum over and over.You know the most outrageously funny moment in the film?  Perhaps the only outrageously funny moment in the film?  At the very beginning, Sellers is playing the lazarooshian beggar in a remake of Gunga Din.  The scene being filmed is the one in which Din saves the regiment by blowing the charge on his bugle and warning the British soldiers of the ambush awaiting them. In the original, Din is shot by the Thugees and dies, his goal achieved. Here, Sellers begins to blow his bugle and is shot.  The call trails off on a feathery note as Sellers collapses.  However, he's down but not yet out. Like the masked killer in a slasher movie he rises again and again, each time his calls becoming less coherent, turning to little spurts and weak random zephyrs, like farts finally, and still he rises and blows as the Thugs continue to shoot him.  It's a moment of monumental and hilarious excess.  A shame the rest of the film didn't live up to those few opening minutes.

But that's what The Party does -- at least for me.Perhaps it is too subtle for some viewers, or they just don't understand the art and concept behind the movie. There are some insightful comments here, such as the connection the Laurel and Hardy. The best is buried way down, years ago. The Party is about a clash of cultures. It is how Americans are viewed by two foreigners Peter Sellers' Indian perspective and Claudine Longet's French viewpoint. It is also about a clash of American cultures, old and young. And most of all, it is about the clash of pretension and unpretentiousness.The humor is not simply the gags, but the absurdity of American behavior and values, as viewed by outsiders. Yet it is made by Americans (aside from Longet and the British Sellers) and is about America laughing at itself (not to mention Hollywood laughing at itself). Now this is quintessentially Sixties (unlike The Americanization of Emily, which I recently reviewed).Perhaps the greatest influence on Sellers was Alec Guinness, with whom Sellers worked with in the utterly absurd The Lady Killers. Perhaps all of Sellers' work can be viewed as a friendly attempt to top Guinness. Guinness was a master of shaping silence. A Passage to India and Star Wars come to mind. In The Party, the humor is not so much in the words, as in between the words.Sellers takes the humor of silence to its ultimate expression in Being There, a role Guinness might have played equally well. But in The Party, it is hard to imagine anyone but Sellers. To fully appreciate The Party it might help to watch Being There first.Given the role of silence in Sellers' performance, it is natural to speculate about its connection to silent films. Here the sad underacting of Buster Keaton comes to mind more than the hyper-acting of Charlie Chaplin. Those silent movie comedians were masters of silence because that's all they had to work with. I wonder how The Party would look with the sound turned off?As another viewer observed, the opening is a parody of Gunga Din. I'm not sure which you should see first. I saw The Party first, and when I saw Good Old Gunga blowing his bugle, I was amazed at how close it was to Sellers, in a sad way. You don't seem to see such wonderful parodies these days. Oh, and then there's Woody Allen's Sleeper, which has elements of The Party in it, particularly Allen as the intoxicated robot butler. It seems that movies often quote and rework old ideas and characters, especially humor. But the great ones still manage to make a creative, coherent new statement, as did The Party.

By then, Sellers' character gets to know MacLeod's latest discovery (and potential conquest) Claudine Longet. Their scenes are some of the sweetest in this mostly very funny movie.

A huge amount of bubble bath was involved in production, with general frolicking all-round. The wit and acting ability of Peter Sellers is brilliant; he's obviously not a lot like the Indian he's trying to portray, but that in itself adds to the fun and parody.The story itself becomes seemingly irrelevant. Indeed, after the first 10 minutes, the film seems to become one huge sketch. The basic plot is that a clumsy Indian actor (Sellers) inadvertently ends up at a party for rich American film stars, and the rest of the film is spent following the actions and reactions of poor Hrundi to the other ethically flawed characters.If for nothing else, I plead the younger generations who are unfamiliar with Peter Sellers to see this movie just so they can see how comedy was done back then.

Good films sometimes overcome their over-rated stars, and this film is fairly well regarded by a lot of knowledgeable people). Sellers was an over-rated actor in my opinion, with a limited repertoire that he exploited to the full (and kudos to him for that), and no amount of ardent fans telling me how wrong I am will sway me from an opinion formed from the evidence that's been shown to me at 24fps. That doesn't mean I think he has no talent &#150; I just don't think he has as much of it as most other people seem to think (and, yes, I've seen DR. STRANGELOVE).If I didn't know better I'd suspect that, in the opening scene of this film, writer/director Blake Edwards was having a sly dig at the self-indulgence Sellers so often displayed in his movies when working with a director too inexperienced or intimidated to rein in such egocentricity. Lampooning GUNGA DIN, Sellers blows that warning trumpet, and refuses to stop no matter how many times he's shot. The scene goes on beyond the bounds of decency until every other actor on the set is emptying their firearm into him. Still he trumpets; squeaky, breathless toots, tuneless laments aimed at the sky as he lies on his back. It works for me as a parody of Sellers rather than a parody of GUNGA DIN&#133; Wait a minute &#150; don't click on that 'NO' button yet. Just because I don't subscribe to the 'Sellers was a comedy genius' line of thought doesn't mean I didn't like this film. In fact I did, and Sellers is actually quite good in it. He's blacked up, and employs an Indian accent that is probably considered offensive these days, but he manages to inject an intelligence and warmth into a character that, for most of the film, is simply the subject of a sequence of borderline slapstick mishaps. He's a stranger in a strange land, as is Michele Monet (Claudine Longet), his kindred spirit, and the land in which he finds himself is obsessed with beauty, success, and status. In his white shoes and red socks and tie he is totally at odds with the stylish and sophisticated West Coast party-goers, but their elegance is all on the surface, while Bakshi's is inside of him.The movie is reminiscent of a silent movie, but more Tati than Chaplin, especially when it focuses on the hapless Bakshi's encounters with modern technology. There is no plot to speak of, just Bakshi wandering around studio head Fred Clutterbuck's (J. Edward McKinley) plush house, grinning inanely at all around him, trying to blend in as he increasingly stands out. The comic timing is often quite sublime, prompting a number of laugh-out-loud moments and, although the film falters very badly in the last third, the relationship that develops between Bakshi and Monet is quite touching. But the ending is woefully misjudged, and at odds with the pace and tone of the rest of the film. It dates the film badly, and comes across as fake and forced.

Bakshi (Peter Sellers) by mistake is also invited to, after already blowing up the set of a movie he was acting in.It's obvious that most of the movie was improvised, as they went along. For most part the movie isn't heading anywhere and consists only out of the one comical event after the other. It makes the movie unique, pleasant to follow and often hilarious but nevertheless the movie is definitely underwritten, so it's both the movie its strongest and weakest point. The movie is lacking a clear main plot and an idea were the movie is heading to. It does make the movie at points a bit tiresome and dragging perhaps, which also causes to make some of the elements in the movie to not work out as intended to.Nevertheless, its fine mostly improvised comedy sequence are often hilarious to watch and make this movie very well worth watching. Most of the sequence are very long in which not always much is happening but its still made hilarious, through the timing and acting of Peter Sellers.Which other actor could successfully and effectively perform slapstick comedy in movies other than made in the '20/'30's/'40's? Peter Sellers is given total liberty here to show his skill and talent. This is a Peter Sellers movie like no other. He already plays a great and hilarious naive Indian character, that pursuits an acting career in Hollywood but thanks to his acting the character and the movie becomes all the more hilarious.The movie does not only have slapstick humor, with a whole bunch of crazy characters but it also features smart well thought out- and executed comical moments, that suit the movie its crazy and light atmosphere perfectly. This is really one crazy party that is wilder than your imagination.Yes. it are its moments that makes this movie such a great and memorable comedy. This is a movie with moments in it, nothing more, nothing less. But nevertheless it are its moments that makes this movie such a great and really memorable one to watch.

I really like this comedy. There's no point of going over what works because I'll be basically repeating what everyone wrote about it here. So instead, I'll just go over the film's weaknesses.The only weakness about THE PARTY is that it's underwritten, too brief and aside from a few memorable moments, there aren't that many iconic moments in it. Or in other words, I simply wanted more! More Birdie Num Nums, more toilet paper rolls spinning endlessly, more focus on the secondary characters, which, for the most part, are as memorable as Hrundi. The film is leisurely paced, which is fine but could have enjoyed a more manic aspect which would have made it possible to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, which is why I'm giving THE PARTY and 8 instead of 10. It just needed to be more fleshed out (for example, the addition of the Russians just don't add anything really).As for my favorite characters, aside from Hrundi (brilliantly played by Peter Sellers) and Michele, they are the waiter (he almost steals the show), the waiter's boss, the drunk blond bimbo and that bitchy congressman's wife. The cowboy (whom Blake Edwards displays prominently) and the Spanish girl were fun but their characters were poorly written. They only added sex appeal to the bunch. The wife and husband were occasionally fun (Save the paintings!). But the worst character was definitely the hairdresser. What a bad caricature. And who was that girl with the tiara? Is she supposed to be a princess? I dunno.Anyway, I bought the DVD, which is fine (the image could be a tad better though) and already watched it a couple of times. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.

Sellers plays a hapless actor of East Indian heritage (an act that would likely be frowned upon in these exceedingly p.c. times, though he almost never treats the character in a demeaning way) who makes an unforgivable mistake on a movie set, causing him to be banned from the industry. Unfortunately, he is accidentally invited to a swanky Hollywood party where he proceeds to inadvertently wreak havoc everywhere he turns! He's barely in the door before he loses his shoe and that's only the beginning. Before long, he's accidentally demolishing glassware, flinging food into the air and destroying original artwork among other achievements. Virtually all of this is done in silence with only background music and barely discernible chatter taking place around him. There is a very limited amount of dialogue in the film, giving it the sort of silent movie quality that distinguished the work of all the greats like Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd and others. Some of Sellers' misadventures are so expertly handled and so jaw-dropping, no amount of audio is necessary in order to find them hilarious. The film is jam-packed with assorted characters including a tipsy waiter (Franken), a blow-hard Western star (Miller), a demanding producer (MacLeod), an uppity matron (Champion) and a nymph-like singer (Longet) who catches Sellers' eye. His real co-star here, however, is the awe-inspiring set. The Hollywood mansion to end all mansions has canals of water running through the living areas, a massive circular fireplace, a motorized bar and a spiral staircase leading to a bridge over the pool. Few areas of the estate are left untouched by Sellers' unintended calamity. Like almost every major studio comedy of the 1960's (and beyond), things continue to a point where it's overkill. The ending is more than a little ridiculous. Still, the eye-catching production design and costumes, the low-key direction of Edwards and the compelling persona of Sellers make this a must-see film. Longet enjoyed a brief bit of success as a singer before making major headlines in 1976 for (accidentally?) shooting her lover. She served thirty days, married her lawyer and retired after that. Sellers would later reprise his Inspector Clouseau character, but this remains the only testament to the hilarity of Hrundi V. Bakshi. Except for a very few moments of dullness, this should put a smile on practically any viewer's face. The film is far too little-known.

For me,one of those is The Party. It must be said right now that comedy,as everyone knows,is a very personal thing-what some may find funny others others will not and just stare at the screen in boredom! Conceptually The Party is very simple-an Indian bit-part actor is accidentally invited to a posh Hollywood soirée and proceeds to create havoc. There are some who might be offended at the very idea of a 'white'actor 'blacking up to play an Indian actor,Hrundi V. Bakshi,but unlike Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau,his character in his film is never made out to be a fool. He may be accident-prone,but he's a much better person than all the Hollywood agents,producers,starlets,etc.he meets at the party,with the exception of Claudine Monet's starlet who begins to see his qualities. Indeed,there is quite a bit of savage satire at the expense of these people.Of course one watches this for the comedy,which starts immediately with Sellers refusing to die in front of the camera and than accidentally blowing up a film set. Once we switch to the party,director Blake Edwards lets the action build gradually,with a great deal of observation. Gags are not thrown at the audience,they are gently dealt out. Take a dinner scene,for instance,Edwards lets us hear the idle chatter and for a while we are seduced into this facile world,and might even miss Sellers being given a chair which is far too small for him so you can just see his head,the waiter getting ever more drunk and finally the climax of the scene involving a piece of food. The Party does require patience,to be sure,but watch closely and there are laughs almost everywhere. Take note also of Henry Mancini's terrific background music which plays almost constantly and comments subtly on the action.Towards the end the film does seem to run out of steam,after side splitting gags involving everything from out of control toilet roll to a shoe on the waiter's tray,it seems to run out of ideas. The only way the filmmakers can climax the film is to make the party more and more wild,with Russian ballet dancers,'hip' youngsters with an elephant,lots of foam,etc. However,the film's final scene between Sellers and Monet is truly charming and beneath all the satire and slapstick there is a great sweetness to the film. It seems that these days comedy filmmakers aim to get laughs just by being ever more shocking. In 1968 they didn't need to.

Bakshi as a kindhearted, naive outsider is a hilarious but, for me, credible invention. Peter Sellers enacts it with amazing precision, grace and consequence.This movie is more or less an American remake of the final phase of Jacques Tati's Playtime, released one year earlier. The tampering with electronic switchboards, the drunken waiters, the funny chairs, the stoic, fat capitalist and the everything-gets-out-of-hand &#150; it's all there, together with a similar, loosely structured narrative style. But whereas Tati worked on Playtime for years with the patience and pedantry of a watchmaker, making it a modern version of a Breughel Painting which addresses social issues, The Party was hastily done. The set design is not very good or innovative. There are annoying spatial discontinuities Bakshi drives up to one of Frank Lloyd Wright's early Californian mansions (possibly the John Storer House) and steps into a rather banal studio landscape that might host a TV show. It has an unpleasant, cheap feel that somehow extends to the cast in general. It leaves Sellers with little support. He has to rely almost entirely on his gags.Incidentally, the expression brrdie num num is unforgettable. In everyday life it can become an ideal surrogate for coarse swearwords. Just try it!

Here, Peter plays an Indian actor who drives everyone to the hilt when he's accidentally invited to a Hollywood studio head's party (when just earlier he had gotten fired from the studio's big picture).The ensuing commotion is amusing, proving how much can be done with a strange character and a few straight faces in one building over the course of a night's party. Sellars plays a very convincing and confused character who, just like Inspector Clouseau, ends up finding trouble by his sheer naivete and a dash of bad luck, yet sees room for humor in the oddest places. He also falls for the obligatory romance.Unfortunately, the film suffers the typical writer's dilemma towards it's end, when all the creative opportunities have been exhausted, yet the film needed more length to qualify for release. As a result, the usual slapstick filler is applied. The cinematography also gets a bit sloppy outdoors with lighting (likely a bad second unit job).Nonetheless, the film has immensely entertaining moments, particularly the dinner party scene and Birdie Num Num. Sellars always knows how to keep an audience's interest, and anyone who has seen the Pink Panther series (a creation of this director), will very likely enjoy this film.

Peter Sellers plays Hrundi Bakshi, an Indian actor brought over from Bollywood to play a lead role. Sellers out-bungles himself in this hilarious film. Producer-director-writer Blake Edwards again teamed with the incomparable Sellers for this 1968 romp. The two had made the hugely successful The Pink Panther (1963) and A Shot in the Dark (1964) that forever entrenched Inspector Jacques Clouseau in the annals of comedy. But, in all of his Pink Panther series, and in most others of his comedy films, Sellers' comic persona is his straight face with diverting looks and comments away from his latest bungling. Not so, for this film. Part of the humor right off is Sellers' huge ear-to-ear grin when he arrives at a Hollywood party to which he was mistakenly invited. And, from there on, the audience is treated to one after another mishap, foible, or accident &#x96; all caused by the kindly but inept smiling Indian actor from Bombay. At times, it seems to me that Edwards and Sellers threw everything into the pot for this film that they had thought up for the Pink Panther series, but not used in the first two films. The entire cast contribute immensely to the humor of this film. J. Edward McKinley, as producer Fred Clutterbuck, is the focal straight man with scene snippets throughout. His facial expressions of disbelief and wonder at who the Indian gentleman is, are priceless and play beautifully with Sellers' next moves and goofs in the film. Steve Franken, as a boozing waiter, Levinson, is another of the Sellers accomplices for laughs. The Party is a plot less film &#x96; by design. The humor comes in one foible or mishap after another. Two things kept me from rating it the highest. First are a few scenes that seem to have dead spots &#x96; where actions don't quite connect. Something might have been left on the cutting room floor, and the flow is interrupted in the edited output. Second &#x96; the build up of humorous mishaps in the last scenes seems too much and deflates the humor. The piling on of goofy situations, with an expanding mishap just doesn't have the humor that individual incidents provide standing alone. Still, adults, especially, will enjoy this one funny and fun movie. Younger folks may laugh at some of the antics and incidents that happen, but their laughter won't be for the same reason.

Miniscule plot concerns Sellers' character being inadvertently invited to a film studio party where he proceeds to destroy the palatial home as he unsuccessfully attempts to remain inconspicuous.There's certainly strong shades of Jacques Tati's classic Monsieur Hulot in the Sellers' characterisation, while the supporting cast provide tremendous comic backdrop, notably Steve Franken as the inebriated waiter. Denny Miller, Gavin McLeod and Gower Champion have minor supporting roles, while statuesque Parisian beauty, the subsequently notorious Claudine Longet has a few scenes as Sellers' love interest. It's essentially a one-man show, slapstick farce of few words (the now ubiquitous birdee num-num emanates from here) but Franken in particular is memorable in the wings.Straddling the pop-culture divide between the conservative sixties and liberal seventies, The Party paints a nostalgic technicolour picture of the era, in psychedelic sound and garish wardrobe and sets, the consequence of which, the film is now dated but nevertheless, absorbing amusement for those who appreciate the talent of Sellers.

For example, Jerry Lewis is probably a better comic mind, but not as good a comic actor as Sellers. Lewis can be funny but tends to go overboard in a two-hour film. Robin Williams in a two-hour film?- sometimes, but not in every case. Eddie Murphy is hit-or-miss, sometimes brilliant for two hours/sometimes awful. In The Party Peter Sellers accomplishes something that is seldom achieved as he is all hit and no miss in this film. He is consistently first-rate for every minute he is on screen.Steve Franken is perfection doing choreographed Chaplin/BusterKeaton type comedy work here, which is very difficult to do right, and any comedian would love it. As presented here it is just very dated for non comedy-buffs, unless you view it as some sort of 1920's comedy tribute.I have never understood Claudine Longet's appeal and still don't after viewing her in The Party, her only major film. Her singing voice lacks any range of octaves, and her acting also has no range or depth. On the plus side, Gavin McLeod and some other supporting actors do a good job in this movie.This movie is actually very meticulously crafted and well thought-out by Blake Edwards and Peter Sellers. However, the superficial Ms. Longet and dated 1960's culture, clothing, hippies, a painted elephant, etc. are very trivial and they trivialize the movie. Despite Sellers' brilliance, I couldn't really recommend The Party except for Sellers completists or comedy buffs.

I understand that this horribly dated late 60's time capsule was made in an era where blatant slapstick reigned supreme, but this film is overkill. Slapstick, to me, is only successful in small doses. Television shows like The Three Stooges or Laurel and Hardy were loaded with plenty of slapstick moments, but they realized that slapstick is only funny if your running time is around half an hour. The Party plays out like one overly done, long drowned-out joke after another. Peter Sellers plays klutzy Indian actor Hrundi V. Bakshi. His performance as lead character is incredibly dull and made worse by his embarrassingly overly done Indian accent and horrible tan. Hrundi is somehow is mistakenly invited to a high-end Hollywood party at a fancy house, which is where all of the humor begins. The ongoing gags seen throughout this film are so horribly run ragged by the end, it becomes painful to watch. One such example is the Butler/Waiter drinking the beverages he's supposed to be serving to guests. In director Blake Edward's mind, If it's funny the 1st time, it should be funny the 73rd time.Throughout the rest of this 90 minute comedy, you are treated to a barrage of completely nonsensical events that are just as dragged out as the rest of the ongoing gags. Intertwined with these moments is a completely half-butted attempt at a romance plot that, in the end, comes off as incredibly sappy and tacked on. The movie starts to wrap up with the introduction of a real live elephant, only for the sake of creating a gigantic mess. Wrap all of this up with the horribly dated 60's/ early 70's flower power style, and you have yourself The Party.Now, before you jump on me, I do like some slapstick comedy. FIlms like Dumb and Dumber perfectly balance the screwball antics with an intelligently written script of stupid dialogue. Now some of you will say to yourselves, oh, he just doesn't 'get' Peter Sellers, to which I would reply The performances of Peter Sellers were great under the direction of Stanley Kubrick, especially his zany performance as former Nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove in the film of the same name. His performances under Kubrick are most likely more representative of his actual sense of humor, as Kubrick was the first director to bring him into prominence in the US.I am frankly appalled by the high regard this movie currently has. I understand it can be appreciated for nostalgia's sake, but other than that I really see no reason to praise this overrated piece of trash.

Or maybe I should qualify that; I'm not a fan of most of his comedy films. I have sat through many where there was little danger of laughter lines leaving permanent creases on my face.Mind you, his Wild Rovers is probably one of the best westerns ever made, and his Days of Wine and Roses is quite unforgettable, but it's the comedies that he's noted for.And the same goes for Peter Sellers. Both guys thought they were far funnier than I ever did. You only have to see some of their 'making of' documentaries to see how they used to crack-up as they made their movies, although I rarely saw that level of hilarity in the finished product.But The Party, along with Edward's The Man Who Loved Women, is an exception. The Party is a very funny movie. Well most of it is funny, and it really only starts to fall apart at the end when everyone, including the elephant, ends up in the pool; at least it didn't go on long enough for Blake to throw in a pie fight.Sellers also caught the right tone. His Hrundi V. Bakhsi, the accident-prone Indian actor who is inadvertently invited to the party of the producer whose film he has ruined, is actually one of his more subtle creations. He underplays despite the accent and the fact that the whole movie is constructed around his attempts to retain dignity while subjected to a litany of mini-disasters.And that is why The Party works where many of the Pink Panther films seem so tedious, everyone underplays and much is conveyed with just a look. Stillness is a quality I don't usually associate with Blake Edwards' comedies but it is a key ingredient here.Although I think Sellers has been overrated if you judge him on his films alone (The Bobo, Casino Royale etc.), I appreciate how good he could be when he was in the right collaboration such as Lolita and Dr Strangelove. Apparently he improvised a lot on those, but Kubrick was the shaping force; the result the genius many ascribed to his whole career. He was interesting in Being There and of course there was The Goons, but did that manic energy really translate from the radio to his screen roles?Sellers makes The Party, but it has a couple of other things going for it a totally winning performance by Claudine Longet, and a score by Henry Mancini &#x96; in its own way, his music marked the 60's as much as did the music of The Beatles and The Doors.I have seen The Party many times over the years and it still makes me laugh, and there aren't too many 50-year old movies I can say that about.

He may be a congenital screw-up, but somehow never lacks for dignified bearing. The house could be collapsing, yet there he would be, still standing, a sickly smile and manful composure. As the hapless screw-up, Sellers delivers in spades.Director Edwards has a big challenge&#x97; he has a series of comedic sketches but basically no story or dialog. For one thing, he brings in Steve Franken, (from TV's Dobie Gillis), as a drunken waiter to help Sellers carry the comedic load. Together, their screw-ups turn polite society into a kind of Marx Bros. chaos. Plus the indoor pool is great comedic inspiration. The sketches are mostly pretty funny, but I'm with those who find the last 20-minutes a misfire. By building the turmoil, Edwards has to climax with something boffo to top all the rest. But the hippie kids, painted elephant and watery foam, are more awkward contrivance than comedic topper. Then too, by that time, the one-note premise has worn pretty thin.Nonetheless, the movie has more than its share of laughs, thanks mainly to that genius of the artful bumble, Peter Sellers.

Moreover, the comedic elements sometimes don't work, but when they do, such as the interactions between Sellers and the inebriated waiter, they are borderline genius. 'The Party' is essentially a film designed for and around Peter Sellers' comedic strengths as we see him bumble in from one set piece to another in a fantastically designed set where the party takes place. Sellers, as one might expect, is marvelous as he nearly always is, and if one can get past his 'brown face' because he's playing an Indian visiting Hollywood, then you'll enjoy this film.

Every gesture, facial expression, protruding eyeballs and using words like Jao jao to the dog or Oh dear to Monet were so flawless, so typical of Indian immigrants at the time, it literally amazed me.Another aspect of the movie is Sellers' accent. Sometimes its hard to believe that it was not dubbed by a real Indian.The attitude of stereotyped characters like Wyoming Bill Kelso when a man is drowning, or the wife of the congressman Dunphy were also very typical of the 60s. I almost relived those days myself while watching the movie.But sadly, people watching the movie in 2009 or later, will not be able to relate to the South Asians they meet in the US or UK today.

Aside from Stanley Kubrick's Cold War farce 'Dr. Strangelove&#133; (1964),' Richard Lester's 'A Hard Day's Night (1964)' and the various works of the Billy Wilder, most of the comedy I've seen from this era has been over-stylish, dated and campy. Take, for example, the second Beatles movie, 'Help! (1965),' which deviated so far from the intelligent wit of the first film that I could only stare in a mixture of horror and disbelief (at least the soundtrack was enjoyable). Blake Edwards' 'The Pink Panther (1963)' was my first film from the director, and, though Peter Sellers was, of course, hilarious as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau, the film itself was a very uneven affair. So I must confess that I approached 'The Party (1968)' with some trepidation. The theatrical trailer screamed 1960s! at the top of its voice, and I deduced that the film would be considerably hampered by an out-dated style that diluted whatever comedy there had once been. Perhaps low expectations are a good thing to have, since I instead found myself pleasantly surprised.Peter Sellers is often held to be cinema's most accomplished comedians, and I can see no reason why this should not be the case. He was an extraordinary chameleon when the role called for it, and no actor ever milked so many laughs from his manipulation of cultural stereotypes, whether that be his fascist German from 'Dr. Strangelove&#133;,' his bumbling Frenchman from 'The Pink Panther,' his vocabulary-challenged Chinese detective from 'Murder by Death (1976)' or this film's good-natured Indian. Of course, it takes a few moments for you to accept such a well-known actor as an Indian, but, by the film's end, it doesn't seem unusual in the slightest. Sellers plays Hrundi V. Bakshi as an affable outsider, completely out-of-his-depth at such an upper-class get-together. Despite his occasionally tendency to be rather clumsy, he eventually earns the respect of the other party-goers, especially beautiful actress Michele Monet (Claudine Longet), through his kindness and indomitable sense of fun.'The Party' was largely improvised from a rudimentary 56-60 page screenplay, and it really does show. There is nothing exceptional about the dialogue, and, though Bakshi gets one or two memorable catch-phrases (Birdie Num Num!), the bulk of the humour is purely visual. There was always going to be a risk in extending a single party throughout a 99-minute running-time, and the end result is rather interesting. Between gags, particularly during the dinner sequence, there is a curious sense of vacuousness, and Edwards indulges in an extended period of idleness that no comedy director today would ever be bold enough to leave intact. In one way, this approach is somewhat reassuring; the director is obviously completely comfortable with what he is doing. On the other hand, you wonder if the story is merely stalling itself, in order to consume enough celluloid to make a respectable feature-length. In any case, despite my adverse expectations, 'The Party' turned out to be an adequately funny and even touching comedy, in no small part due to the magnificent talents of its leading man&#133;whatever nationality he might be.

However, knowing also that this film is now available exclusively on R2 as a SE DVD, eventually brought me around to it.Anyhow, having now seen it, I can't say I agree with its being accorded a cult status of late true, Peter Sellers creates an amiable caricature of a displaced accident-prone Indian actor in Hollywood, Henry Mancini provides an appropriately raga-tinged score and there are one or two genuinely rib-cracking laughs (the shoe accident at the beginning and his destruction of the toilet around the half-way mark) but, on the whole, the effect is muted and only fitfully amusing. In fact, the film loses steam well before the end especially when it resorts to pathos (Sellers falling for an aspiring singer) and hipness (the crashing of the party by the younger generation); besides, the antics of a drunken waiter are amusing at first but they too grow tiresome by their sheer repetitiveness.

Peter Sellers is one of the comedy geniuses of all-time, whose career was cut many years short by an untimely death. And his genius is completely illustrated by this film, not only because of his unfailing, talented performance - but also because, when viewed as it must have appeared on-paper, this story seems to be one better-suited to a skit or 22-minute sitcom than a full-length (albeit a shorter one) movie. When one views again in view of his other memorable works and characters it seems like Sabu meets Clouseau meets Henry Orient meets Chance the Gardener. Don't ignore the fact that this was also done in the company of female leads which included Claudine Longet and Marge Champion, hardly candidates for a Hollywood star. (Sure, Marge could dance, and I suppose Claudine can ski.)Whenever I see a Sellers movie, besides regretting that he's been gone for more than 25 years now, and regretting missing the several additional films one would have expected from him following Being There, I'm also reminded of reading in many quarters how difficult and different from his screen persona he was in real life. This is nothing unheard of (e.g. Arthur Godfrey, from the past - more a radio/t.v. personality, but with some film work - along with Tom Cruise, Billy Bob Thornton, et al, today). It just seems odd that this engaging man on-screen wasn't at least closer to this likable, sometimes-oafish, always-bizarre individual, in reality.

In fact, the movie has racist overtones in Sellers' depiction of the bumbling Indian actor. That said, the main problem with the movie is that much of the slapstick is contrived and too predictable. Good slapstick should be clever. There are moments of brilliance, primarily in some of Seller's dialogue. The rest is tedium, and many scenes go on for far too long, and simply don't work.

He receives solid support from a cast also including French beauty Claudine Longet (as party guest Michele Monet), Marge Champion, Buddy Lester, Gavin MacLeod, Fay McKenzie, Denny Miller, Timothy Scott, Ken Wales, and Carol Wayne.

He appeared so convincing as a junior artist from India as not only he had the looks of an Indian but also behaved like a true Indian. The scathing criticism of a high society's party has been handled in a very organized manner. In many ways, 'The Party' indicts class differences which are responsible for creating unnecessary distances between human beings. This film was also able to present nothingness in all forms as nothing much was happening in the party as everybody was busy with their own activities.

By an egregious error, his name later ends up on a guest list to the swankiest party in the Hollywood hills, where anyone who's anyone will be there, and on man who's no one, but is infamously the life (and cataclysmic destruction) of the party by its end. Edwards toys with us, gradually unveiling simple awkwardness as our sweet shy hero tries painfully to make friends with the horde of snobs and snakes also in attendance. Soon the mistakes and slapstick energy ramp up and thanks to Hrundi, the party becomes a riotous madhouse of busted water fountains, drunken waiters, pratfalls, madcap silliness, and the obligatory sleazeball producer trying to get a wannabe actress (Claudine Longet) all up in the casting couch. Hrundi shows shows a fondness for her when they meet, and the two of them are quite endearing together, providing some nicely paced moments among the momentous lunacy. Sellers, a brit known for bumbling elsewhere as Inspector Clouseau, nails the hilarious East Indian accent, and creates a wonderful character that carries the film on its comic highs, while never never getting too far fetched or hammy.

When his offbeat improvisation and unwitting behaviour sabotage the entire production, he is fired and black- listed, but by a single mistake, his name is added onto the guest list of a party thrown by Alice Clutterbuck (McKenzie), the wife of the studio head Fred Clutterbuck (McKinley). So Hrundi happily accepts the invitation and attends the party in Clutterbuck's posh mansion, and turns the party into an absurd and bubbly farce.The absurdity might come from the influences of Jacques Tati, but its calibration is much broader and the devil-may-care outlandishness is less refined, quite pertinent to serve the purpose of caricaturing the tawdry and supercilious constitutions of the Tinseltown industry though. Without a particular character-building or story-unfolding, the story meanders aimlessly through Hrundi's slapstick around various characters, among which the guests are all dignified in their formality, apart from the host and hostess, some notable ones are the Western film star Kelso (Miller), a haughty Ms. Dunphy (Champion), and a French chanteuse Michele Monet (Longet) accompanied by bigot producer C.S. Divot (MacLeod). The scale of buffoonery balloons accordingly through Hrundi's often unintended bumbling, and the drunkenness of the waiter Levinson (Franken), whose clash with the major-domo Harry (Lanphier) is crack. But essentially, it is Sellers' one-man-show, fashions a funny Indian accent, his gaucheness is a miraculous laughter-inducer, against his self-aware diffidence, he is an exemplary comedian, a bona-fide humorist, who is too good to debase himself into raunchiness, no vulgar toilet jokes, instead his pee-holding antics producing one of the optimal funny moments inside a toilet. Edwards' long-time collaborator Henry Mancini scores an entertaining big band soundtrack, where the theme song NOTHING TO LOSE sung by Monet in the film is agreeably catchy. It is difficult to me to claim this is the best comedy of its time, as evidently Edwards lets it loose a bit near the end, all sensational but also indolent in its development, the whole farce evolves into a revelry, without considerable moderation when a painted elephant walks into the foreground, finally as if all the ballyhoo only makes a contribution to en-kindle a budding romance between Hrundi and Michele, we never get a punch-drunk final blow the film seems to promise with its pungent irony, in spite of all its distinctive merits and innovative comic bravura "},{"Title":"Movie num num","Date":"26 October 2014","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Peter Sellers takes the cake as Hrundi V.

The scene with the dinner party is a classic ensemble piece. I am not sure how this movie could have been done without Sellers. He is the star and the script at the same time.

I think the truth lies somewhere in between.The early part of the film, when Peter Sellers is wandering--almost silently--around the house, reminds me of Mr. Hulot (a classic comedy style). Personally, I found Sellers' leering grin annoying. Some of the bits were cute, but none were side-splitting as one reviewer said.As the movie evolves, they add more characters as if someone brainstormed how can we make it wackier? How about a balalaika player? And a painted elephant! The music transforms from jazz to pop. Now it looks like the set of Laugh-in. Sellers tries to out-Jerry Jerry Lewis.I must admit the set (an ultramodern house equipped with electronic controls and water features) is a masterful design and the real star of the show. The stepping stones over the water reminded me of Hulot, again.They manage to include the little-girl vocal styling of Claudine Longet, and Carol Wayne appears. I am only surprised they did not include a Keystone Kops-like intervention by the police. Oh wait, they did.Clearly, this film is not for everyone. Some will find it hilarious. I found it merely interesting--in the same way I found It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World engaging, but not really that funny in most parts. It is also interesting as a largely unscripted experiment.Much better vehicles for Peter Sellers are Being There, The Pink Panther, and Lolita.

We know!","Date":"31 January 2007","Score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":" Today, Bakshi (Sellers) can be viewed as a prototype Borat in that he pokes fun at the cultural misunderstandings between the East and West. In a quarrel between Bakshi and an opportunistic movie mogul pawing Michele (Claudine Longet), the Westerner indignant at being deprived of his prey, asks the Indian Just who do you think you are?! To which Bakshi replies In India, we do not think who we are. We know! On the level at which this exchange took place, this is of course a joke. But it is also funny from a philosophical point of view. Western philosophy is dominated by Aristotelian philosophy which is ultimately subjective in that existence is viewed largely from the self and what Aristotle called the apprehension of reality. Descartes turned this idea on its head by saying that he knew he existed because he thinks. Both hypotheses are invalid in Hindu philosophy where worldly existence is viewed as pure illusion (maya)and all that we think exists (including ourselves) is only an idea in the mind of God. This view is well represented in Greek philosophy by Plato who wrote of a perfect world of ideas from which the material existence of things in this world derives. When I was growing up, I usually heard horror stories from Filipino relatives living in the West about how they got in trouble or suffered embarrassment because they cooked oriental food or ate them in the presence of people of Anglo-Saxon descent. In 1958, my lady cousin was the subject of a complaint in the apartment building where she lived in Saginaw Michigan because some tenants complained of the awful smell of the garlic she used in her sauté. But today, Americans in the major cities, at least, are probably the most knowledgeable about cuisines of the world. I bring this up because in the movie, the Sellers character inadvertently dips his fist into a bowl of caviar and he was nauseated when he brought up his hand near his face. Westerners display the same expression when they come upon fermented fish paste and dips common among peoples of Southeast Asia. I guess that's why we have the adagesTo each his own and There's no accounting for taste. A southerner who has gone to the Far East asked me if I eat the delicacy called balut in the Philippines. The Thais, Vietnamese and Cambodians refer to it by other names in their respective languages and you can find it here in the US in many oriental groceries. Bluntly and scientifically put, it is simply the semi-developed fetus of a duck still in its shell and suspended in amniotic fluid. It is boiled and touted by some as a fortifier for those in ill health or even as an aphrodisiac. The amniotic fluid tastes like a most excellent soup. Most Americans I know are simply turned off in shock at this description. Even today, I get quizzical looks at work when I answer questions about what I am eating. Pickled jellyfish and black century eggs, what else? But guess what? I have a southern cookbook printed in the 1930s that has dressing procedures and recipes for possum, raccoon and squirrel.But this is neither here nor there about the movie. I have nostalgic feelings about the young Claudine Longet with the wispy, whispery voice and cute French accent singing  Theenk of rennnn... (Think of Rain). She was one of my absolute favorite female chanteuses of the 1960's along with Astrud Gilberto. Alas! As an aging beauty she committed a crime of passion killing a two-timing boyfriend who was dumping her. She was acquitted for some reason and didn't go to jail for it.

Why not, I thought.The gags are both visual and spoken, expected and unexpected. When you expect the expected, the unexpected actually happens, no doubt helped by seasoned Sellers director, Blake Edwards.Many have written reviews going into those gags in detail and the validity of an English comic actor playing an Indian but all that takes up valuable laughing time.

Starring the legendary Peter Sellers and directed by Blake Edwards (the combination responsible for the original Pink Panther series) this film is curiously sandwiched between arguably the two most recognisable actor-director collaborations in history (Stewart- Hitchcock in the 1950s and De Niro-Scorsese from the mid-70s onwards). So much of this film's appeal lies in its simplistic plot. Sellers dons the blackface to play Hrundi V. Bakshi, a hapless film extra who, through a clerical mistake ends up being invited to an exclusive Hollywood party instead of being fired. From there, chaos ensues at the hands of a man who urgently needs to be appropriate and polite in the context of the party, but his natural curiosity and unfamiliarity with his surroundings wreak havoc of the highest degree.Sellers is fantastic as the main character, and really gets the chance to show off his various comedic styles in this film. He channels Chaplin's unmistakable slapstick humour in several instances, while also working in a fair share of wordplay/more sophisticated laughs (whichever phrase you prefer) and his ability to improvise has paved the way for modern-day A-list comedians who rely on that skill including Steve Carell, Tina Fey and Will Ferrell. While aspects of the film such as the supporting cast and the overall setting are hardly impressive (the entire film was shot on a painfully obvious MGM lot, in typical 1960s fashion), their importance falls by the wayside in a film centered primarily on comedy. Far more significant is the innovative and unique screenplay, ahead of its time in terms of the way dialogue between characters builds to create well structured and often elaborate jokes.I feel that what sets this film apart from other concurrent and contemporary comedies alike is its reluctance to create a-laugh-a-minute scenarios. While it succeeds in making us laugh where appropriate, it also seeks to address social issues existing in 1960s American culture; just another example of how ahead of its time this film really was. As Hrundi makes his way through the hosts' gigantic house, he observes the pitfalls of the American Dream drugs, alcoholism, greed, deceit, vanity, materialism, sexism, racism and societal constraints. Some twelve months later, the recently departed Dennis Hopper would direct Easy Rider, the undisputed authority on American subcultural criticism. Of course, The Party does not dissect these issues as thoroughly as Hopper and Fonda's road trip epic, but it appropriately exemplifies the film's multi-faceted direction.The climax of The Party has been criticized for being too excessive and somewhat outside the tone of the film, but I believe it's in keeping with the zany nature of many other comedies of that era, and only seems outlandish to us because of, for lack of a better phrase, a film- related generation gap. Otherwise, it's a film that certainly benefits from multiple viewings, if only to gain a greater appreciation for Sellers' comedic talents.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

On top of that, he is told that he'll never work in movies again! Of course instead of being blacklisted, he mistakenly gets invited to a high-profile Hollywood party, where he gets into all manner of hilariously absurd situations.Once he shows up at the party, there is no such thing as a plot.

Hillariously awkward like many of Sellers's comedic roles, but with a heart of gold and the best of intentions. Sellers delivers a great performance as this great character, as always. There a very few actors who are skilled enough to make the audience laugh by doing little more than standing still, but Sellers manages to pull it off. He even does great in a largely serious scene near the end of the film...simply put, the man is a genius and this film really shows it.Though overshadowed by Sellers's greatness, the supporting cast is great as well. The drunken butler was definitely a highlight, he made the dinner scene very funny.

Here we see an overdone character in an over-stressed film. We have unimaginative attempts at humorous characters, waiters who drink a portion of whatever they serve, cowboys and starlets, and the Sellars character interacting with each and all. But one has to suspend belief a bit too much, because the characters have to suspend awareness out of all proportion to what is believable. A cooked pullet is bounced off our hero's plate and across the table to reside in the hairpiece of the actress seated there, not only does no one see this but she doesn't notice the extra weight of the thing which balances perfectly there. Many of the characters are lampooned as Hollywood types, but this has been done before and better without making them look as if they are always ignoring what is going on right before their eyes.It may seem an imaginative assembly of slapstick antics, but that sort of thing was fresh in the 1930's - maybe.

But she goofs and accidentally puts his name onto the invitation list for a fancy Hollywood party.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't live up the sinister promise of the beginning. Basically, Sellers just gets into different slapstick scrapes, some hippies bring in a blue-painted elephant, much to Seller's dismay, he ends up filling the house with bubbles, there's a waiter who keeps drinking the booze meant for the guests. Overall, it's just silliness without the structure or plot which could have made the movie much funnier.

Predictably, the good laughs are few and far between, but much is made of Sellers' ability to talk through clenched teeth. Look for the handshake joke that Kevin Smith stole for Mallrats - this time it's done with caviar, which is probably emblematic of how far Hollywood has gone in the last thirty years.

Bakshi (Peter Sellers) becomes persona-non-grata in Hollywood. However, due to a mistake of the secretary of the producer of the foregoing film, he is invited to a party for the big shot, where the Clutterbuck hosts the most important and powerful personalities of Hollywood. I do not know how many times I have seen this movie on cable TV, but yesterday I saw it once again now on DVD. The Party is a classic comedy, one of the funniest I have ever seen, and I laughed again as if it were the first time I was seeing it. This movie certainly is Peter Sellers and Blake Edwards' masterpiece, having lots of improvisation in many scenes. The first seventy-five minutes running time are outstanding, beginning with a funny parody of Gunga Din. The rhythm slows down when the romance between Bakshi and Michele Monet (Claudine Longet) begins, but anyway there are still some funny jokes. I do not know why this movie has never been released on VHS in Brazil, and only a couple of months ago it was released on DVD. It is amazing how the British actor Rowan Atkinson imitates the clumsy and careless movements, looks and behavior of Bakshi in his character of Mr. Bean! Does he pay for the use of copyright to the family of Peter Sellers? My vote is eight.Title (Brazil) Um Convidado Bem Trapalhão (A Very Clumsy Guest) "},{"Title":"It is like a gas engine huffing and puffing with no where to go.","Date":"24 March 2002","Score":"0 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This is more than a slapstick comedy, but a lyrical farcity of misconstrued accents and innocent women raving for a party.  A must see for any beginning mestrualist.  Born from an english well to do family, peter sellers reinvents the cultural-shock of a foreigner and the naivety of one who doesn't see the cultural difference in him.

It was a goofy, goofy ending with a sappy component.  Towards the end the young people crash the party looking like they were dressed in fashions from Target.  Most of the characters were cliches and Peter Sellers' portrayal of Hrundi V. Bakshi would be considered in todays political climate as racist.  At the time he was considered funny and his character was cute.  The music, dancing and ending were so goofy and portrayal of the young people almost insulting that it is no wonder an anti-establishment movement was flourishing at the time.  The producers were clueless about what was happening around them and the portrayal of their generation in this movie was probably right on.

The opening is pure budget and the overlong scene stretches till it gets boringly ridiculous. And those British oh God how embarrassing!-jokes just annoyed me. Overacting is not good comedy and most of the time the movie is not funny at all. Artistic value zero. A memorable two, three scenes saves this picture from a 1-rating.3/10 "}{"Title":"Absolutely pathetic","Date":"13 September 2004","Score":"4 out of 19 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  This movie was absolutely pathetic.Do yourself a favour, and turn this movie off after 5 mins (the only two funny parts of this movie occur during this time)1. Peter Sellers wearing a waterproof watch2. Peter Sellers accidentally detonating the dynamiteBut the actual party is one big long bore. I was having trouble figuring out if it was the waiter or Peter Sellers who was the main character (both were equally NOT funny).How many times did the waiter actually appear? It was painful seeing the same gags overused time and time again (ie the one waiter strangling the other, or the lady of the house falling over the balcony into the pool about a 100 times).The Peter Sellers flooding the bathroom gag was just plain bad. The whole party was just plain bad. The whole movie was just plain bad.And as if it wasn't already intolerably bad by this point, chuck in a bunch of hippy kids with a painted elephant... horribly horribly bad.I'm not surprised with the good rating of this movie, there are always going to be fans with typewriters who automatically assume anything with Peter Sellers is great.However, the discerning film viewer would do themselves a favour by steering well clear of this farce.
