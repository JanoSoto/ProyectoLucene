[{"Title":"subtle but chilling portrayal of madness","Date":"29 September 2002","Score":"130 out of 145 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Robin Williams gives what may well be the performance of his career in `One Hour Photo,' a creepy psychological thriller written and directed with cool precision by Mark Romanek.  Given its premise, the film could easily have degenerated into a sordid, exploitative tale of obsession and madness.  Instead, Romanek has chosen to take a more subtle approach, fashioning a film that downplays the potential violence of its material while, at the same time, recognizing the humanity of its central figure.Romanek understands that the greatest threats to our safety and lives often come from the gray, nondescript people who surround us unnoticed, the `nobodies' whose benign faces and vacuous smiles reveal no trace of the insanity, evil and potential for doing us harm that may be lurking right there under the surface.  And nobody is `grayer' than Si Parrish, an innocuous, socially undeveloped milquetoast who spends his days working as a photo developer in one of those sterile five-and-dime drug stores (just like the one in `The Good Girl') - and his nights sitting all alone in his drab apartment brooding over a massive family-photo shrine he has erected to the Yorkins, a seemingly happy family of three whose pictures Si has been developing, copying and obsessing over for more than seven years now.  The film centers around Si's growing fixation with this one family and his delusional belief that he too could somehow become an integral part of their family unit.  Then comes the day when Si realizes that he is no longer content to be a mere vicarious member of this adopted family and, thus, begins his plan to gradually insinuate himself more and more directly into their lives.As both writer and director, Romanek manages to keep us in a state of vague uneasiness throughout.  We are always anticipating some potentially dreadful event, yet Romanek doesn't go for the easy thrill or the obvious plot turn.   Thanks to Williams' subtle, incisive performance, we come to understand something of what makes this strange character tick.  We begin to sense the deep-seated loneliness and social awkwardness that have come to play such an important part in defining both his behavior and his character.  Si is scary, but he is also pathetic.   He may have slipped over the edge into madness, but it is a pathology rooted in overwhelming loneliness and the inability to `fit in' to the societal `norm' of marriage and family. Even when his character is at his most threatening and irrational, Williams somehow makes us care about him.  Romanek hits upon a few ancillary themes as well.  He acknowledges how photos create the appearance of a life without necessarily reflecting the reality of that life.  Most people, Si confesses, record only the `special, happy' moments of their lives &#150; birthdays, weddings, holidays etc. and leave out the mundane or painful ones.  Moreover, Si tells us that people use pictures as a way of defeating aging and time, of saying to the world of the future that `I', this seemingly insignificant person, was really here, being happy and enjoying life.  To match this theme, Romanek's visual style often feels like the director's own personal homage to The Photograph, as the camera scans caressingly across a sea of snapshots &#150; and Si's voiceover narration complements that feeling.`One Hour Photo' is not a film for those who like their chills heavily laced with bloodshed, murder and mayhem.  It is, rather, for those who can appreciate a quietly unsettling, yet strangely compassionate glimpse into the dark recesses of the troubled mind.

Williams is especially good at playing creepy characters, as he has done several times in the last decade.Here, he plays Sy, the photo guy, a lonely employee in the photo department of a suburban Target/Walt-Mart//K-Mart-whatever who lives vicariously through a nice family, whose family pictures he has developed and printed for years. So, when Sy discovers the husband of that family is cheating, he takes it personally....and gets involved.This was a fascinating portrait of a deranged man and a wonderfully photographed movie. The colors in here are astounding at times and the camera-work innovative with some neat angles. The suspense of the story builds and builds one gets that old film-noir feeling of impending doom.This has a different ending, though, than most old film noirs, not exactly what the viewer might think will happen.This is a film that, as far I know, never got much publicity, but it's a gem. Williams is outstanding in his role and the hour-and-a-half you invest in this movie flies by.

The film is powered by the haunting, chilling, silencing, and above all-genius performance by Robin Williams. But the rather extraordinary thing is that it is not Robin Williams on the screen, it's Sy Parish (the character's name). Robin Williams fades away from our senses and slips into the ever so sweet and innocent yet psychotic role of a supermarket's photo developer. The films script is only accented by Williams, at times, restrained performance. Williams ignites on the screen and burns till the last frame, and you are unable to take your eyes off him. As I mentioned the film is subliminily written as well as directed. Though being Romanek's first, I certainly don't think this is a bad start. Romanek's direction adds to the on-going tension throughout the film. More affecting is Williams' delightful calmness. Trying to hold himself in becomes more troublesome for both Williams and his character as the story develops. Yet through the calm eyes of an innocent blaze the fires of hatred and intensity, which could very well sum up Williams' performance. The film does have some disturbing images as well. Yet they are not really strong enough for you to get up from your seat and leave yet rather the opposite. Williams' contribution as well as guidance towards the actions and scenes of peril compell as well as amaze you towards both the performance and film itself. Williams' shocking contribution to the screen is enough to make you cry, scream, and yell in your seat. Because the origins of the character are bittersweet just like own known Williams, leads to a crazed and psychotic breakdown. It's as if watching our own funny and beloved Robin fail us. Though the truth could not be any further, Williams but succeeds in the art of acting, creating an achievement in the field. Creating a landmark. Writing his/its own chapter. I guarantee that this film will be required study material in acting classes for now on. In conclusion definitely one of the best of 2002.

It is very much an independant film.  If you don't like movies with little action or a low budget don't see this movie. This film is good because of its' strong performances and decent script.

The only bit of cheer in his day is to develop very good photos in his lab, and he takes great pride in his work. His favourite customers are the Yorkin's, who have a son and regularly develop pictures.  Seymour's like for this family goes beyond `like' and he feels part of their family and has all their pictures on his wall.  However when both his job and the unity of his family are threatened he reacts.I  saw this film in a free preview screening before it came out so I had no reviews to cloud me first.  Happily most of them appear to feel the same as I did.  In terms of plot this set up will be no surprise to anyone &#150; we've all seen Single White Female and Pacific Heights etc, we know what happens that leads to the old bunny boiling etc.However One Hour Photo is different enough to justify watching.  My wife complained that it was too slow and boring but I felt this approach helped it stand out.  Instead of being a thriller it was more of a cold slow boiler than was more chilling than thrilling.  The plot is well laid out &#150; even the money shot of all the pictures on the wall is played out while we're distracted by a joke from the Simpsons on TV.  The director's cold approach to story telling works very well and highlights Seymour's grey existence and cold life.  Only occasionally does he go astray &#150; the fantasy sequences don't always work for instance but for almost the whole film he does very well.Towards the end Seymour's behaviour goes erratic as we expect and I was worried that the film had eventually given way to clich√©.  Happily this is not the case.  Yes, Seymour's change is a bit of a leap at first but the film cleverly pulls it back at the end.  This makes it above the rest of this genre by a good head and shoulders.  Clever touches abound in the film but don't always work.  For example the director shows us that it is all about seeing by covering Seymour's eyes with objects in some shots to show he has lost his ability to watch, while the name Yorkin is a slight play on `Your Kin' or your family.  These are clever but don't add very much &#150; the eye theme felt a bit too clever and intrusive.Williams is excellent.  Having paid to see him mush around in Patch Adams I was worried here that eventually his emotions would run away with him.  However Williams (and here's something you'd won't hear much) keeps it all in check and underplays wonderfully.  His Seymour is likeable, sad, pathetic and chilling all at once.  It's hard not to feel for him and he is better for being low-key.  I truly felt Williams had turned himself into a `little' man &#150; one of those people who you barely notice on the streets as they make no lasting image.  Vartan (Alias) is good as Will and Nielsen is also good as Nina.  They are also given firm support in the shape of Gary Cole and La Salle.  However his is Williams show and, by underplaying, he steals it easily.Overall this has it's flaws but it is head and shoulders above the rest of this stalker genre.  Directed with a clinic eye rather than a thrilling eye this is clever and different enough to more than justify checking it out.

As with most movies, even critical darlings by the master himself, Mr. Hitchcock, there are questionable plot contrivences and scenes where reality has to be suspended, but these annoyances did not interfere with the total enjoyment of the movie.  Williams was eerily brilliant as Sy, The Photo Guy, and was able to travel between chillingly detached and forcefully angry with ease.  The brilliant use of stark colors fleshed out the film, and those that garner enjoyment from the sets and cinematography, as well as the dialogue, will be pleased.  This is a film for those that enjoy the total movie experience, and those that appreciate an intensity in their psychological thrillers will not be disappointed. After viewing this film, the question now becomes who gets the Oscar, Williams for One Hour Photo, or Pacino for Insomnia ?

Romanek pays attention to the minute details often overlooked by most directors through the use of natural lighting, exceptional cinemaphotography that gives you a moment to take in the scenery and a soundtrack that doesn't force the viewer to keep fiddling with the volume.  At 90 minutes in length, there is no pointless filler doesn't bore you and irrelevant side plots to push it to the 2-hour mark.  It's a movie you can sit back and enjoy without feeling distracted by ridiculous special effects, jittery camera work or a disjointed plot.  It has a peaceful, deep and thoughtful feel to the narration and dialog that is enhanced and complimented by the soundtrack.  You can identify with the characters because they're not some Hollywood fantasy - but real and identifiable everyday people who react as you would expect everyday people to react.Robin Williams has proven that he's a versatile actor.  I've always liked his characters in comedies (i.e., Mork and Mindy, The Birdcage and Death to Smoochy) - however he really shines in more dramatic roles (Moscow on the Hudson and Awakenings).  His character Sy in One Hour Photo takes him to the next level, but he's not the center of attraction.  This is a good thing. Romanek gives the movie a sense of balance by giving characters depth and dimension.  He makes sure that the perfect family that is the focus of Sy's obsession has problems just like everyone else in spite of their picture perfect affluent lifestyle.  We see that while Sy succeeds at work with a warm, friendly disposition - his personal life is cold and lonely with his surroundings at home the same impersonal and sterile environment at work. Sy's character fits perfectly.Another bright spot in One Hour Photo was Dylan Smith, who played the son of the family that Sy is obsessed with.  He's a natural actor who has the ability to play natural characters - an average kid who does a splendid job of acting as an average kid.  Romanek doesn't insult the viewer by subjecting us to the stereotypical, annoying, mouthy, whiny, know-it-all kid with the bowl haircut that has ruined movie after movie.If I could change something - I would cast someone other than Gary Cole to play Sy's boss.  Maybe it's the MST3K fan inside me saying this, but after seeing Office Space many times, I kept waiting for him to reincarnate the role of Bill Lumbergh in even the most subtle way, mmmm-kay?.  Romanek knew how not to cross the fine line that separated Cole's role as the sadistic boss in Office Space from boss in One Hour Photo.I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.

It is a clever little movie that works both as a psychological thriller and an intriguing character study. Thankfully it does not have the absurd twists one has witnessed in the overrated 'Fatal Attraction' or nonsensical ones like in 'Single White Female' or 'The Hand That Rocks the Cable'. The storytelling is very coherent and the portrayal of the characters is very subtle.This isn't a fast-paced thriller. Writer and director Romanek takes his time to tell the story but that does not make 'One Hour Photo' boring. On the contrary, it allows us to discover the shades of Seymour and allows the viewer to feel sympathy for but also be fear of him. Likewise, we also discover the family Seymour/Sy stalks. At first they appear to be like a happy American family but soon we see, through Seymour's point of view, that reality is something else. Romanek creates a very gloomy cold atmosphere. The viewer does feel Seymour's loneliness from the busy supermarket to his claustrophobic apartment. The film is very well shot as it highlights the gloominess, indifference and closed atmosphere. Romanek also approaches interesting themes about what photographs mean i.e. proof of ones existence (beautifully explained in the film). While people take pictures of happy moments, their reality is something else.Coming to the performances, what would 'One Hour Photo' be without Robin Williams? The actor is in a completely different form and he does an excellently downplays Sy. Sy is gentle, polite, pathetic and creepy. Williams really brings a humane quality to the character rather than portray him as the clich√©d stalker. Nielsen and Vartan are good too. La Salle and Cole give sufficient support. But, in the end, it's a one man show that belongs to Mr. Williams.There are a few very minor flaws such as a few scenes where reality is suspended but overall this is a cleverly chilling film that deserves to be watched but do not expect lots of murder, bloodshed, or silly twists like boiling a live rabbit.

Its the kind of film that makes you stop and think about it for days after.When we got into the car, we began discussing it, and all three of them changed their assessment of the movie.  It turns out they really hadn't gotten the nuances and hidden messages.  They just didn't understand it. This film is incredibly subtle.  It does not take you where you think it will.  You think you know whats going to happen next, but you actually have no idea.If you haven't seen the film, stop reading here, because I'm going to talk about the plot.  If you haven't seen it, you shouldn't read anything about it - just go in without any assumptions.This movie was frightening, heartening, disheartening, disturbing, incredible.  Robin Williams plays a character that is absolutely nutted up.  He is a perfectionist, an obsessive person, a man with no family, no warmth, no life.  He works in a sterile environment in which there is no warmth, no life.  His apartment is sterile and cold.  As the film begins, Williams' character gets into his car and there is a crack in the windshield and this is the point at which his life begins to crack up.During the film I felt afraid of the Williams character, I felt sorry for him, I wanted him to get caught, I wanted him to get away, I wanted him to have a life, I wanted him to have warmth - the movie carried me back and forth emotionally.  For example, at one point the Williams character goes to the little boy's softball game and I was worried something bad was going to happen to the boy.  I mean, it gets your mind going, and you are thinking, What do I want here?  Do I want the boy to make friends with Williams? Do I just want Williams to get away from the boy?What a brilliant performance.  I think Robin Williams should be nominated for an academy award for this film.  I think its the best thing I've ever seen him in.

Robin Williams' acting is a very brilliant surprise. Every shot keeps you interested in what will follow. From the opening scene with Sy wanting to look at his photos during the police interrogation, I kept wanting to see these myself. His creepy, put-upon persona reminded me of several people I'd been acquainted with over the years, and, yes, even reminded me of some of my own neediness.Even though I know he ends up getting into trouble, I kept thinking don't do this (making extra print copies for himself - taking photos of his ex-Manager's daughter - having a heated argument with the Xerox repairman, holding the knife on hubby Yorkin and his girlfriend, forcing them to simulate sex for the photos) but he did it anyway. The cinematography was pin-point perfect, with white fluorescent lights in the Sav-Mart, dim, almost sepia tone in his apartment, eerie bluish tint in the hotel parking garage during the police chase.I'd read Williams was originally offered the part of the store Manager, but I was so grateful he asked for the part of Sy instead. He became him. Just like Nicole Kidman in whichever project you happen to see her in, Williams becomes chameleon-like in this character. In other films of his, it's not like he actually becomes a character, more like him being a personality used to sell tickets (Patch Adams, Toys, Hook, Jumanji, etc. - none of which I have a desire to see). The last time he was really submerged into character was with Popeye (aha - Altman knew what to do with him).I bought this on DVD, yet I was at a friend's house and it was shown on FX this past Sunday evening, being the first time I saw this in a while. I'm definitely putting this one in the machine very soon.Now, going into Wal-Mart or any other store of that nature, seeing the One-Hour-Photo department just hasn't been the same.What leads me to think this is, in part, a satire on what darkness could lurk in the minds of department store employees, is that when I see these people now, I sometimes stop and wonder what their lives are like after 9pm (or 10 if you're in a Target).Some DVD fun - keep this on the main menu screen with the loop of the opening theme music, watching photos of Robin Williams flash on screen (designed after photo packets). Sit there and stare for a while, you'll be hypnotized.Nice features include behind-the-scenes footage with interviews interspersed with rehearsal footage and outtakes. Williams really hams it up, parodying the scene he and the other actor are about to perform.

Nor is it a movie to see if all you want is the escapism the movies so often offer us. For those who want that, there are no shortage of other movies out there, and good ones in their own right.Robin Williams characterization of Sy, the Photo Guy is wonderful, one of his best, a chilling, humanizing and many-layered portrait of a deeply disturbed individual. What struck me most in watching the performance was the tug-of-war in my own mind about his questionable sanity and his motives. While it's extremely clear from the start that he suffers some significant psychopathology, the ending leaves one wondering (at least a little) about the method madness, and whether it is he that is sick, or human society in the 21st century. We've come quite far from the use of psychopathology as a plot driver since such movies as DePalma's Dressed to Kill.I don't wish to include any spoilers here.  Suffice it to say that by the end I felt that where Seymour went wrong (aside from his obsession) was in having motives that in a sense were a little too good, too moralistic, too rigid... but for reasons that the film ultimately justifies, without excusing or judging. I could see virtually nothing in the writing that was gratuitous or unearned, even if the situations did become rather extreme. Each character remained believable, and even those one was set up to dislike, such as Sy's boss (Gary Cole) were neither presented as saints nor absolute demons, but merely as flawed human beings with motives and drives that sometimes contributed to the unfortunate chain of events that are the throughline of the movie.Rather than demonize Sy, the central character, those who made this work bring us into Sy's mind in a way that is quite certain to be deeply discomfiting to many, but with a compassion and honesty that is only rarely achieved these days (or at any time in the past) in the movies.The screenwriter-director, Mark Romanek, is a talent I hope will go on to greater public appreciation with time, but whether that happens or not, may his projects always find a green light somewhere. He has only directed one other feature film I'm aware of, STATIC, which seems nearly impossible to find on video. The rest of his work, as is so often the case with visually stunning directors, has been in music video, including videos for Madonna and Nine Inch Nails.If I could find fault with anything about the movie it would be in the marketing. Where Romanek and Williams make Sy appear as a deeply flawed (and deeply disturbed) human being, he is clearly presented utmost as a sympathetic character.  This is quite a feat in an era where paranoia is rampant, especially when it comes to stalkers and the mentally disturbed. Yet the marketing campaign seems to present the simplistic cliche of the creepy stalker, emphasizing only the monstrous aspects of his nature.I've noted in reviews here and elsewhere a certain polarization of opinion surrounding this film. Perhaps some of those who disliked the film were drawn in by the promises made in posters and ads, and felt cheated (or confused) that this was not the one-dimensional suspense thriller that marketing tried to sell it as?

The same uneasy (not necessarily nervous) feeling that one experiences during a film like Notorious or North By Northwest can be experienced here.  The audience isn't scared of Williams' character, they're uncomfortable around him, which is just how the other characters in the film view him.  The other great element of the film is that it is easy to follow.  While the trend in the mystery / thriller genre of today is to confuse and disorientate the audience as a means of creating tension, the director takes down a straight road that has several bumps along the way, which provides the same tension without all the confusion (See this film, then watch either Memento or Mulholland Drive).  I can go on and on, but I will leave you with the this as a close to this review.

Only when Sy is sure that the police have arrived at the hotel does he attempt to make his escape, thereby insuring the police will also encounter Yorkin and Maya in their hotel.  Thus, Sy makes it impossible for the Yorkins to go on living a lie.  I feel Sy believed he was saving them for their sake and for their son.  It's left open to you whether or not you think he succeeded.As to theories about the snapshots at the end, I seem to recall the police said there were TWO rolls of film, one in Sy's bag and one still in the camera that he left in the hotel.  At the beginning, the detective says `We processed the roll of film in your bag.  They are not very pretty pictures' and  `What did William Yorkin do to provoke you?' implying they are prints from the first roll that we see Sy take of Yorkin and Maya--but we never see those prints.  Instead, at the end of the film, we see the prints from the roll that was still in the camera.  But, anticipating the former, we are confused, stunned or surprised when we instead see the bizarre shots he took after he returned to his room.  The director leaves it to the viewer to interpret the meaning of those.As to the family photo that preceeds the credits, Robin Williams said (on the DVD) he felt it was Sy's dream of the way things might have been or could still be.  The director said it was up to the viewer.One Hour Photo did contain some flaws as noted her in other reviews. However, given that it was Mark Romanek's first screenplay I think we should cut him some slack, and look for something even better from him next time. My rating, 3.5 out of 5.

Yes, it is conspicuously disturbing and probably should be filed under the same classification that contains Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange and consequently is rightly rated R.  That said, for the right audience, it delves into the quandary oft pondered, Where does categorical love cease and morph into destructive psychological illness?  Furthermore, focus on the plight of the lonely white lower-middle class worker who feels that society (read special interests and the government) neglects him but chooses to forgo complaining.

From every roll of film they bring in, he makes copies just for himself. He soon begins to imagine that he is a part of the family. He really does like these people, and wants nothing more than for them to like him. He gives the 9-year old boy free toys and such from the store he works. He does lots of things in hope of them liking him. I don't want to say that much more, in fear of giving too much away, but it gets extremely disturbing.It would be a crime to not give Robin Williams an Academy Award nomination for this role. He does this so well that while watching it, you sometimes forget that this is the same person that was once a loveable character like Mrs. Doubtfire. By far Robin Williams's best performance to date. The other performances in this movie were also convincing. But this is Robin's show.Mark Romanek does a great directing job and writes a great screenplay here. One hell of a movie debut for him.To sum it up One Hour Photo is my favorite film of 2002 so far.

This is definitely Robin Williams' best performance ever.  He's so believable that you forget it's Robin Williams up there on screen; this guy IS Sy.  I actually cried at the part of the movie when Sy cried while looking through the pictures Jake took.  I never thought Robin Williams could make me cry, but he did... which is a good thing.  If you see this film, you'll feel how painful his empty and practically nonexistent life is.  Also, the dialog was unexpectedly realistic.  Besides Sy's explanation of why he did what he did near the end, other dialog that stood out was when Nina told her son that everybody knows that Sy's sad, and that they should just HOPE he feels happier.  It would've been better if they actually DID something instead of just hoping he would feel better, but, sadly, that's the way life is.  Only one thing bothered me the very last frame!  What was that?  Why were we shown a happy picture of Sy with the Yorkins?  Did it represent how Sy still thought he was still connected to the family?  That last frame was very confusing and does nothing but hamper the ending.   Many people believe One Hour Photo will be a thriller (based on what they see in the the trailer), but it's the farthest thing from it; it's more like a drama... a really disturbing, heartwrenching, beautiful drama that few will see because of limited release.

It's his fullest and yet most restrained effort to date. One Hour Photo creates an effective portrait of a lonely, deranged man becoming increasingly frantic. He crosses the line from being harmless and pathetic, to being dangerous when he can no longer differentiate between fantasy and reality. There comes a time when it is no longer enough for him to fantasize, when the role of distant observer, no longer satisfies. Robin plays the role of a man named Sy, who runs the photo-developing lab at the local Savmart. Sy has nothing in his life but his job and his fantasies -- no friends, no family, no wife, and no girlfriend. He looks depressed in tranquility and suicidal when he smiles. Sy's obsessive nature has a good side. The prints he develops in his lab really do look gorgeous, and takes pride in his work. On the other hand, he is also developing a fixation on a family, the Yorkins, and has an entire wall of his apartment plastered with photos of them dating back 10 years. And now -- though the movie never specifies an emotional trigger -- he is losing his grip of reality, falling further into his delusional thoughts. Much of ''One Hour Photo'' informs the audience through visual stylization. The cinematography is as finely detailed as Sy himself. Williams inhabits a carefully selected color scheme, a world of harsh whites and washed-out blues, illuminated by the glare of fluorescent bulbs. Director Mark Romanek pays more attention to this style than giving depth to his characters and plotting, exploring Sy's psychosis but never really delving into the reasons behind it. A disturbing yet compelling film that pulls you in solely on the merit of Williams' fantastic performance.

He can play a creep as well as he can play a funny character. His performance in this film is mesmerizing, while the whole project seems to build up suspense then fizzle around him.Williams plays Sy Parrish, a mild-mannered clerk in charge of developing pictures at a Wal-Mart type store in some unnamed suburbia. Williams comes off as lonely and overbearing as he obsesses over a young couple (the Yorkins) and their son. It seems that he has made a copy for himself of every picture the couple has brought in to the store for development over the years. He has even gone as far as building a collage on one of his apartment walls of these pictures. Sy fantasizes about being a part of their family. In one sequence, he even imagines himself in their home using the toilet and watching a Michigan State football game on the tube. With no living family of his own, Sy has nobody else he feels close to.Things start falling apart for Sy by the end of the first hour. He is fired from the store when a large discrepancy of photographs were found to occur on his shifts. His boss hates him anyway, and that was the excuse he used to get rid of the old man. Sy seems to suspect that the Yorkin family has turned him in, so he decides to get some revenge on the husband. He follows him to a hotel and forces he and his mistress to pose in some pornographic photographs, presumably before slicing them up with a large hunting knife. Sounds interesting enough, but at the end, we find out that nothing really happens to Mr. Yorkin or his mistress. Sy just took pictures of various things in their hotel room; not even of the couple themselves. Okay.....I can't say for sure what the point of this film really is. Other than letting Williams show us how talented he is, there really isn't much to the whole thing. The film is certainly no classic, but it's definitely worth seeing once. Especially if you like Robin Williams. And who really doesn't like the furry little guy????? 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Maybe a movie masterfully directed, powerfully acted, with a believable and deep screenplay and with a superb use of score, cinematography and art direction.Is One Hour Photo a masterpiece?I'm almost sure.Mark Romanek, better known for directing videos for bands such as The Rentals, makes his feature film debut with an original screenplay of his own about loneliness and the alienation of our society. A sad story about sad people, and a frightening tale with ordinary life monsters.Of course this is the kind of movie that is better watch without anything spoiled at all, so I won't bore you with the plot... instead, I'll go straight to the artistic evaluation of the film. Having said that, why not start with the cinematography? I have to say that this is one of the best uses of cinematography I've seen in the whole story of movie making... the cold, boring Sy (Robin Williams) life is full of cold colors that will remind you of Stanley Kubrick's 2001... but the irruption of Sy's family is underlined by a subtle change into Kodak style colors... that's the line between Sy's increasing madness and real life. The score, which we could consider minimalist is also perfectly used to underline the increasing tension and is no wonder that Romanek has a lot of experience shooting videos... the only score flaw, however is that some rithym reminded me a lot of Filter's version of One (as published in The X Files Movie soundtrack). This is one of those movies in which everything (art direction, costumes, cinematography, sound, editing) seem to match to perfection.For the acting, the supporting cast is believable, and Connie Nielsen is the stand out. She's a lovely wife and mother, but not a cliched one... she's believable. In fact, I bought this family as a real family, I easily forgot that these people were actors (the screenplay develop this characters to the exact point of making us actually care for them without distracting that the focus of our attention is Sy and his devotion for them).So here we get to the whole point of the buzz surrounding this movie is this the best Robin Williams performance ever?Yes.This is not Robin Williams acting. This a candid camera work into Sy's life. How many times can you really say that after watching a movie? Not many, I guess. Robin Williams and Mark Romanek are under control of this movie and not in a single frame they lose it (well, I have just a problem with a shot... but it is a single shot and it is perfectly explained, so why really bother).And for the direction, I've just said it all strong, accurate, perfect at acting and composition... the best director nod should be assured. Mark Romanek has achieved one of the best film debuts I can remember in a long time (maybe since Quentin Tarantino and Tim Robbins debuts in 1992 with Reservoir Dogs and Bob Roberts)... Romanek is not a promise, he is a reality.This film will be compared (it was compared, due to the similarity of the origins of Romanek and Spike Jonze) with Being John Malkovich.. but it is not an accurate comparison. One Hour Photo is a serious approach to its issues, while Malkovich played with surrealism in order to surprise the audience. In Photo, it is the use of icons (as unexpected as a toy, for example) which can surprise you with unexpected references. As you can see, I really dug this movie, which was leaving me in awe in every scene... till a point that I can't do anything but surrender to the fact that Romanek's movie will play a very influential role in the next years.What about the Oscars? There is a difference between what it should and what it can be... Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actress, Original Screenplay, Score, Cinematography, Film Editing and Sound nominations should be in their deserved way. Reality is that given the competition, this may be overlooked and simply in the best of the scenarios get an Actor and an Original Screenplay nominations (maybe even wins). But as the reviews are highly positive, maybe the top 10 lists will fuel its chances and we'll see a One Hour Photo's clip at Oscar Night.Make Sy happy. Actually, he deserves it.

He makes a very human, even sympathetic psycho, and really disappears into the character--no small feat for such a recognizable performer.  Too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste.  The supporting performances (and performers) wouldn't look out of place in a soft-core porno (it doesn't help that every character but Sy is made of 100% cardboard).  At times, the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate suspense we know from the very first moments a) that Sy is a complete whack-job, b) that he survives, and c) that he gets nabbed by the cops at the end.  So all we're left to ponder is the hows and the whys, and the answers provided aren't all that interesting.The plot is plodding and contrived, and features some nonsensical moments (for instance, the husband berates his wife for her expensive tastes, even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount superstore).  About two thirds of the way through, Sy does something so irredeemably stupid that it makes one wonder how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme.  And the final clich√©d explanation of his psychosis, right out of `Peeping Tom,' is a terrible copout.The dialogue is of the absolute worst sort.  It's not overwritten, or awkward, or unbelievable, or bad in any other way that could be considered fun, even for bad-movie lovers.  Instead, every line is purely, hideously functional--it's as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter and said, `Hey, I need a workable script on this--in an hour.'  It made me want to scream, honestly.This movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban beware-the-help thrillers of the eighties and nineties (`The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,' e.g.), and while it's certainly unpleasant, it's never really scary.  Sy's fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable, but on its own that's not enough to make the film work.

Just the first few sequences reveal about this, an ominous-looking camera looking straight at us as if to point inwards, a man in his lab bringing images to life, followed by happy birthday party footage as a way of saying that life is a matter of what images you choose and keep to remember. But the study feels obvious and watered down, a voice- over pontificates.The only thing of note is a softer ambiguity around suffering, this; the film begins with the man interrogated by police so we know that something bad has taken place, except we don't know what or how bad. Our mind races ahead, imagining the thriller. A whole sequence near the end as police storm the hotel room toys with just this anticipation of images, the camera enters the bathroom and we expect some atrocity. The crime was that he was robbed of what every human being needs, warmth and affection. The suffering is that the images he inhabits are not his own. In the end we see the images he did capture in the hotel room. I'm not quite sure what the filmmaker is pointing at here, judging by how watered down feels the rest I'm inclined to think it just means he was harmless, not prurient.

The point is, he's taken on the roll of a lonely, depressed and run down senior with a true passion for quality in is line of work (a negative printer at the photo counter or photo-guy), a job where the mass production of sub-par material is the height of tedium in his existence, but occasionally he sees something that makes him smile with its beauty and wonder, and that's a real capture; smiling families, funny moments, and his favourite family, the Yorkins. This family he is unexplainably obsessed with, they don't realise it, and when you do it shifts the gentle persona of Si to one you suddenly want to watch our for. I liken this creepiness to the uncle you find out is a pedophile, in the scene switching between Si's flat, empty of personality and company, and the Yorkin's modern home where the mother puts the son to bed and tries to reassure her son that I'm sure Si has lots of friends.

There is one scene in the movie where he sits his car outside the Yorkins house and imagines himself inside their house, mentally masturbating over the idea of wearing the husband's sweater, using their toilet and watching their TV. This is the funny part i mentioned.

It serves as probably my favorite Robin Williams film, and proof that many comedic actors can take on a dramatic role effectively. The problem is, many don't take the opportunity when it comes.Robin Williams plays Seymour Sy Parrish, a photo-developer at a corporate giant known as SavMart. Despite Sy's soft-spoken, and generally harmless aging man appearance, he is actually a very depressed man who obsesses over the seemingly perfect family of the Yorkins. The Yorkins are the typical American family; a husband, a wife, and a young boy. Sy has been developing the Yorkin family photos for years, and is assuming the role of Uncle Sy in the Yorkin family.He does this, of course, because he does not have a family of his own. He lives alone in an apartment with a collage of photos of the Yorkins. All the pictures are plastered to the wall in order and neatness, leaving no gaps or overlaps. He begins to stalk the family after a certain period of time, and from that moment on, Sy isn't so harmless anymore - but actually mentally ill and in dire need of psychological help.Robin Williams jumps right into the role of Sy Parrish. He's creepy, stylish, believable, and scary. From the guy who has done things like Jumanji and other nonsensical films, here comes something you'd never see from a man who played a sailor who loved spinach at one point in his life.But the true talent here is director Mark Romanek, who has worked on many music videos for Nine Inch Nails, R.E.M., and Weezer. Romanek stayed true to the story of the film, revealing more and more informations about Sy and his intentions for the story that he made subtly on purpose. He gives descriptive backstory on why Sy is the way he is at the end, but you may have to do research to piece together everything. While Romanek explained a lot, you still have to come up with your own explanation for the ending. And my view on it is something I dare not give away because I feel it's one of the most mind-boggling, yet, thought-provoking endings in recent memory.During the course of the film, Sy narrates over it, which is nothing but fantastic. His narrations are very relaxed, in a quiet tone for much of the time. And scenes where he explains his customers and what pictures they take is extra information you wouldn't think a film like One Hour Photo would contain. Even graphic insight and personal opinions on cameras and pictures are given here. The film goes outside of its plot boundaries to deliver explicit detail to the audience. I can't thank Romanek enough for giving this an extra dimension to work with.I found this a tiny bit relatable to the film LOOK, which was made about seven years after this. LOOK was directed by Adam Rifkin, a relatively unsung director who shot the entire film with security cameras giving authentic depth and feel to it, while following not-so-innocent people around and connecting them in an anthology-like format. Both this and that show people that we could be being watched and not even know it. That's the power these films bring. And you only get more skeptical every time you watch them.One Hour Photo, even with repeated viewings, is disturbing, and visually interesting. It's creepy to think about Sy's actions, but it's even creepier thinking that back when film was developed constantly, and places like Walgreens and Wal-Mart's One Hour Photo booths used to be filled with customers, how easy it was to obtain one person's pictures. It's amazing to think just five or six years ago we used to be protective with our pictures, count on them being done in one hour, and then only be shown to a certain number of people. When now, we upload pictures to our computers and then make them so the whole world can see. My, how times have changed.Starring Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen, Dylan Smith, Gary Cole, and Eriq La Salle. Directed by Mark Romanek.

He is a legendary funny guy, but where he really shines is his serious roles. He proves this in One Hour Photo, a dark and suspenseful thriller about Sy, an employee of a one hour photo lab at a local supermarket, who becomes obsessed with a seemingly idyllic suburban family. Sy's obsession grows to disturbing lengths as he starts to uncover secrets about this family and begins to feel an obligation to protect them, as well as himself. This is a disturbing film that is paced wonderfully and shot with a calm and non-intrusive specialty that captures the films growing suspense excellently.The best thing about this film is its unique pacing and very specific mood that stays consistent throughout the entire film. This film is very brooding and its plot develops very slow, establishing the troubled character of Sy very well and in some of the creepiest and most unexpected ways possible. This film has a lot of tension that builds at a pace much more intelligent than the average thriller. The entire setup is very captivating and the director of this film deserves a lot of kudos for creating a story and a protagonist that are actually engaging and really are thrilling.Sadly where this film falls short is its climax. So much tension is built and the levels of suspense rise to such great heights that it really leads you to expect a lot out of this films climax and conclusion. Unfortunately it doesn't quite get to where you really want it to be, and the way everything pans out is pretty disappointing. The climax and what happens after it isn't bad, and it would have been OK with a film that hadn't set itself up as well. It would have fit right in with the same mediocrity as before. But One Hour Photo builds itself up from the ground so well that when it reaches its peak it is fairly anti-climactic and really leaves you wanting more. All the film needed was a little more thought to go into the conclusion of this film and it would have been truly incredible, but it just lacks that last little push into excellency, thus I can only credit this film as being good.But that doesn't change the fact that Robin Williams is just incredible. This is one of his finest and creepiest performances ever. Sy is such a disturbed man, and Williams makes you believe every last bit of him. The character is extremely well written and darkly constructed to carry the tone of this film. And while Williams is the main focus of the film, the supporting cast does a great job as well. The family Sy stalks is a very believable family, other than a few small bumps along the way. There are various small roles that pop up throughout the film, and none of them seem to drag down the film as they all center around Sy and drive his character's motivations and emotions, which are the heart and soul of this film.One Hour Photo isn't quite a great film, but it is very good. There are some great things about it, but it falls short in its conclusion that it almost ends up being more disappointing than anything else. But it goes to show how fantastic the setup of the film is when I am this disappointed by a conclusion that doesn't deliver what I wanted it to. Robin Williams is the shining pilot of the film who makes it a truly disturbing and captivating experience. I would recommend this film, if only to see Williams incredible performance.

Becoming increasingly absorbed into the complexity of his own comic genius and less and less able to return from the various personalities he could assume (sometimes vicariously) his fans could only wonder if they might concern themselves with his mental health one day. The reassurance this might not be in the offing, however, is somewhat evidenced in his role of Seymour Parrish, found in the remarkable film, One Hour Photo. For, unlike Mr. Winters, herein we see Robin Williams demonstrate a dramatic genius in parallel with that of the comedic, and a possible saving grace of sensible balance. As a fan of both, this reviewer certainly hopes so. Obsession represents itself always as bizarre; we are even advised to grave concerns when we see almost any manifestation of it for it is indeed tied to many sinister and criminal acts. Seldom do we ever get a chance to look closer, to see the more forgivable of its possible origins. One Hour Photo superbly takes advantage of this...in many ways, especially as its dramatic core builds to crescendo and to dramatic denouement, again, superbly. More and more we wonder if this was designed around the role expressly meant for Mr. Williams to play, a real feather in the cap of casting excellence. Lovely Connie Nielson performs beautifully as Nina Yorkin, a wife and mother just finding out why her self-indulgent husband is becoming more and more neglectful. The second woman, (Erin Daniels) coming to the same photo mat for her picture development is the one and only stretch the script makes but one allowable. The viewer is not effected by any unrealistic sense of contrivance. Viewers will presume the worst, prepare for the worst, while the unexpected ending becomes the most remarkable aspect of all. And the most heartfelt. All in all, an incredible movie that I feel certain will justify viewers' attention...and then some.Bravo for the writer/director, Mr. Mark Romanek and his casting staff.JCH "},{"Title":"Although Robin Williams' Greatest Performance. . .","Date":"7 August 2008","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" This film could have been flawlessly great!

The latter's character is fairly well-written, if there could have been considerably more on-screen development(and he's the one who was most fleshed out).

The narrative follows a Photographic Lab Technician, Seymour (Sy) Parrish played by Robin Williams, who is a lonely, sad, creepy character living his life through other peoples photographs. He develops a dangerous obsession with a particular young family whose photographs he has processed over the years. Through his work he accidentally uncovers a less than ideal family situation, which he seeks to rectify.This film takes place in flashback. Voiceovers are used to drive the narrative and to heighten suspense by unnerving the audience. These are often Sy's voice-overs relating his personal knowledge on photography and applying his photographic insight to the narrative. For example in one scene Sy explains that a huntsman once noted that all the kills he had made on a particular day were hurried shots taken without deliberate aim, defining this way of hunting to the photographic term snapshot. This voice-over reinforces the unhealthy relationship Sy has with photography by making the connection between photography and hunting.The protagonist of the film One Hour Photo Sy Parrish is reminiscent of Norman Bates the protagonist of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960's film Psycho. Both protagonists appear innocently genuine, however they both have unhealthy obsessions. Norman Bates with his mother and Sy with the Yorkin family.The theme of One Hour Photo is voyeurism with Sy Parrish's invasion of people's privacy through viewing their photographs.Another form of visual art that is used to build up suspense in One Hour Photo is the television. An example of this is when Sy is watching an episode of The Simpsons where Homer tells Bart that the person who wants to harm him is probably the person he least expects. This gives the audience an insight into Sy's obsessive and potentially dangerous personality. Another example is when Sy is watching the film The Day the Earth Stood Still, the voice that can be heard is of an alien who explains to the people of the Earth that if they extend their violence to the outside world there will be consequences. This is an effective forecasting devise which gives the audience further insight into Sy Parrish's avenging character.The re-occurring motif throughout the film is photography. The shot composition is carefully chosen by Jeff Cronenweth to symbolise photographs. A good example of this is at the end of the film Sy is sitting in a room seen through a window, the image bordered by the window frame taking the appearance of a photograph. Another scene that visually reinforces the connection between photography and the theme of this film, is where Sy is looking down at a blank sheet of photographic paper, which in my opinion symbolises the emptiness of his life.In creating the creepy character of Sy Parish Robin Williams has once again truly cements his outstanding acting ability.One Hour Photo is a promising debut from Mark Romanek and I look forward to his future projects.7/10 "},{"Title":"Precise and ordered production design, measured performances","Date":"25 December 2006","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Relief at Robin Williams in a role that almost wholly omits the saccharine sentimentality that has become his trademark is superseded by a sense of awe at the production design and direction of this low-key thriller.

The use of tense, mood-building electronica music (by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek -- though I'm not sure they wrote the bulk of the pieces we hear) and mise en scene showed that writer/director Mark Romanek has watched a lot of Hitchcock and has figured out how to update his lessons.Like Hitchcock, he picks an innocuous, should-be-safe environment -- a suburban K-Mart type store (similar to but way more sterile than the one in The Good Girl.

The main characters in both are deeply scarred by a painful past but that's where the resemblance ends. Or is it?  Rod Steiger's Sol Nazerman is tormented by recurring flashbacks of Nazi Germany; Robin Williams' Cy Parish has effectively excised memories of his abusive childhood and is living in a world decorated by smiling snapshots where everyone, including himself, is happily suspended in aspic. Nazerman is emotionally anaesthetised to the point where he feels neither pain nor compassion while Parish engages amicably with the people in his world if not the world itself. The brutal backdrop of Nazerman's impoverished New York neighbourhood serves as a reminder that he has fled one hellish reality only to arrive in another. Parish's world is a still-life Twilight Zone where fantasy is slowly getting the better of reality - or is it the other way around?  In the time honoured Hollywood tradition, both men find redemption of sorts in a messy catharsis.Here at last is a film where Robin Williams is relieved of all comedic duties. His demonstrated ability to deliver an emotionally powerful performance without uttering a single word seems to be lost on Director Mark Romanek. What a waste. Parish finally confronts/confesses to the grim realities of his ruined childhood in a scene I found clumsy and unnecessary - screenplay comes also courtesy of Romanek. Visually, he could have made far better use of the Shopping Mall as a cavernous, sterile, alienating and vaguely sinister reflection of Parish's own empty life. This one alas, will go to the great graveyard of might-have-beens. But it's a workmanlike film which, as an average psychodrama is otherwise right on the money. Perfect for a rainy Saturday Night. Why not get out The Pawnbroker as well?

It was worth the wait. The film at first seems to be a Psycho remake, but Robin Williams and the director Mark Romanek have crafted a truly beautiful parable of our isolated modern age. Sy (Seymour- SEE MORE?) is the anti-hero in this film. Perhaps hero is too strong a term, but in a world of directionless yuppie drones who choose to ignore life, he becomes a sort of existential man of action. Is he creepy and disturbed? Yes. But so are all of the blandly normal characters in the film. ( The young son is an exception to this rule). Most of the TV clips you may have seen really don't reveal the depth of characterization Williiams and Romanek give to Sy. In less capable hands this could have been a horrible film, but all of the characters seem all too human, and well drawn. As a former One Hour Photo employee myself, I can say that they got the working environment 100% on target. There is some very subtle and clever cinematography. Watch for how the tone of color changes to set the mood, to warm yellows when Sy interacts with people, and cold blue-white when he is alone. Even though this is a cinema buff's film, the plot turns and suspense are top notch and will keep you watching until the end; it will also keep you thinking for a good while afterwards.

This is not an ACTION film!!!!  There is very little 'action' in the literal sense and you should not go into the theatre expecting it, or you will be disappointed.  Many people complain that the film doesn't have as much action or violence as they expected, when the problem was that they were expecting any at all.  I would even go so far as to object to the 'thriller' label... much of the movie is not 'thrilling' but rather suspenseful and sad.There are 3 emotions on prominent display here, and Williams portrays them both very well loneliness, sadness and anger. Throughout the course of the movie we watch Sy progress through these three states, and it is such a natural progression that it alone is what makes the film stand out.  Williams does an EXCEPTIONAL job in this role, which is fortunate because he gets most of the screen time.  People who didn't like his performance I think misread the role.  He does not (nor is he supposed to) have a crazy serial killer personality.  He is a repressed man - that is the reason for his sometimes stifled actions and emotions. I could picture myself in his shoes easily, and I didn't find myself yelling 'No don't do that you idiot!' at the screen as I am often known to do.  Audience members are able to closely identify with his emotions and that is what creates the suspense - because you know what you might think of doing if you were him - and these possibilities are unpleasant.  When you see Sy begin to act these things out it is really uncomfortable.A few more brief things I should mention..  the ending is NOT anti-climatic, when you consider the rest of the film and the character. The photography is quite good (no pun intended), and the music fits very well (sorry, didn't see the similarity to American Beauty...).

It stars Robin Williams, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Dylan Smith, Gary Cole and Eriq La Salle. Music is scored by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek and cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth.Sy Parrish (Williams) is a loner photo technician at SavMart's one hour photo shop who becomes obsessed with a family whose photographs he develops....No one takes a photograph of something they want to forget.2002 was a stellar year for Robin Williams, it saw him give two dramatically potent performances that dampen down the bile spewed up by those who haven't been able to forgive him his comedy excesses. Insomnia has (rightly) found a more appreciative audience since 2002 because of the rise of its director, one Christopher Nolan. One Hour Photo, though, still seems to be striving for recognition for its qualities, in fact, for its understated qualities.It's evident now that many have gone into the film expecting some psycho stalker movie, and subsequently have been disappointed to find One Hour Photo is nothing of the sort. What unfolds is a sedately paced story of a fractured mind, of a loner who is so detached from society he imagines himself being part of a family, by way of his job, that he thinks is perfect. When the family of his selection turns out to not be a bastion of Americana, the little thread in his head clinging to sanity finally breaks, and then......Here's the problem. This is no slasher, people need to understand that mental illness or isolation from society does not mean psycho death killer, and thus Romanek's film becomes an observational character study of someone detached from realism. Creepiness permeates the picture, big time, but you shouldn't be putting this in the horror genre. Romanek always holds the upper hand, structured as it is, we the audience find ourselves holding on to see just how far Sy Parrish went with his pursuit of family harmony? With that comes the question of if the finale delivers substance? Well that depends on if you want red blood histrionics or brainy grey area.There were cuts and studio interference, and in the finale an explanation for Parrish's mental issues reeks of a writer being handed a solution by the studio paying his bills. Yet this is mature pot-boiling stuff, a film that dares to simmer and not let the pot spill over for multiplex appeasement. While Williams is nothing short of terrific, an edgy and understated performance that only makes us lament that he didn't do more of these portrayals at his peak. 8/10 "},{"Title":"A fascinating exploration of loneliness to insanity","Date":"3 June 2006","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" One Hour Photo is one of the creepiest psycho-thrillers of the last few years, because of the way it gets under our skin, and almost turns us into a voyeur, like the central character Sy Parrish (Robin Williams in one of his finest film roles to date).Sy works at SavMart as a photo lab technician. We've all met these people behind a counter where we drop off film rolls to be developed. But I'd never really given much thought to the development process. One Hour Photo actually shows us how rolls of film are slowly developed into the finished product of a collection of photographs.If there is one thing that's important to Sy it's his customers. They entrust their rolls to him, he guards them copiously, and painstakingly crafts them as if they were works of art. But of all Sy's customers, the Yorkins are the most important to him. Will Yorkin, his wife Nina and their son Jake. Sy has been developing their pictures for seven years now. And he takes an active interest in their welfare.The Yorkin family life depicted in the photos is happy and eventful. They have a beautiful house. They are loving. They share everything. They are the happiest, most content family who ever lived. In print. But in reality, it is a very different story. Nina is a good parent to Jake, but Will is much more neglectful. And he doesn't show much affection to Nina either. Because he's secretly having an affair.Sy is blissfully unaware of this. Because he prefers to live within the fantasy of his photos. Not only does he develop the Yorkins pictures, he makes extra copies for himself. And places them on a wall in his drab apartment as a bizarre sort of shrine to the Yorkin family. They represent everything missing from Sy's life. Although Sy is a seemingly unassuming man who blends in with the crowd, he is a painfully lonely soul. He has no family. No friends. No joy. No life.Robin Williams gives a powerhouse performance. playing a man forced to live with his own loneliness. Mark Romanek's direction is top notch and lends the film a sharp edge. The cinematography is gorgeous and surrealistic. There doesn't seem to be a frame wasted. And most importantly, the hues of browns and gold almost make some of the shots actually seem like real captured images. It only strengthens the point being put across how life can be captured in a photograph, and be made to seem more happier than it really is.Romanek keeps things moving at a brisk pace, giving us ample time to explore Sy's psyche while also furthering the plot. Williams gives a deeply affecting as well as moving performance of a tortured man and his inner demons. Scenes of Sy at SavMart drenched in dazzlingly white colours and neatly stacked shelves is Sy's personal heaven, and are then juxtaposed with Sy's miserable existence at home with drab colours and a lifeless atmosphere of melancholy that hangs over him.I think with One Hour Photo Robin Williams has finally put to rest some of his disastrous film choices of late. Here he is completely believable as not an evil man, just a lonely one pushed to the breaking point. His turns of character are always plausible because of the steady direction. From Sy's amusing dedication to his job, to being irked when people fail to show him the respect he feels he deserves, his anger at being fired, to his raging psychosis at the climax.There is always an ominous feeling hanging over the film. We know something bad is going to happen. But Romanek restrains himself and never goes for the easy payoff. He allows events to unfold at a leisurely pace, with a remaining residue of uncertainty forever lingering. Watch the scene when Sy has just been let go. As he's walking through the aisles, you'll notice the numbers that mark them off. And Sy's face gradually becoming more unrestrained with the passing of each number. His volatile nature is always there just waiting to explode. It is this type of subtlety that allows OHP to shrug off the others of its kind.Connie Nielson gives a good performance as Nina. She's most effective in her scenes with Sy and his clumsy attempts to make conversation with her. But this is Williams' show all the way. He is in command of every scene. Showing remarkable restraint for the most part, and when he does indulge his wild side, it is entirely in character. The funny man has changed his act.Romanek also provides some deeply creepy images. The shrine sticks firmly in my mind. As well as Sy's supremely eerie dream. Sy's voyeuristic impulses taking over when he discovers the Yorkin family life is less than perfect. There is so much communicated in a tiny shrug. Or a significant pause. Romanek knows the value of subtlety. And that is the mark of a good director. I look forward to his next film.I was a little surprised by the ending, because it wasn't quite what I was expecting. But it was still satisfying in an odd way. There are people who may feel disappointed. But I felt OHP ended with a bang.There are lots of nice touches throughout. Especially Sy's narration that easily allows us to sympathise with him and his situation. One Hour Photo is a marvellous story of one man's mental meltdown, and the tragedy is, how it largely goes unnoticed by the everyday world.

He works at the photo lab in the SavMart discount store. He takes great pride in his work and strives to develop the best picture possible. He was the kind of guy you could trust with your pictures...Or was he? He always treated the customers with great respect. One particular family he took a shine to was the Yorkins. Nina Yorkin and her 9-year-old son Jake came in to have their film developed quite often. Sy has been developing their film since Jake was a baby. Nina and Jake were real nice, but Nina's husband, Will Yorkin, was a selfish bum. When work was through for the day, Sy went home to his empty apartment, for you see Sy was friendly on the outside, but inside he was very lonely and depressed. His only hobby was photographs. What nobody knew was that whenever Sy developed the Yorkins' pictures, he'd always keep an extra set of prints for himself, and now one entire wall of his apartment was covered in the Yorkins' photographs right up to the day Jake was born. It's not just a hobby. It's obsession; The next day, Sy clashes with the photo lab technician because he felt he did a shoddy job repairing the equipment. The technician cursed him out then left and Sy stood, shouting at him. Later, Sy's boss, Bill Owens, chided him for it. Bill's a real jerk. After work, Sy drove by the Yorkins' house and imagined what it would be like to stroll around the interior. So he imagined himself touring the house, watching the ball game on their plasma screen, drinking their beer, and even having Jake call him Uncle Sy. But it was only a fantasy. Sy continued to act like he was part of the Yorkin family. He watched Jake's soccer game and ran into Nina at the mall and had lunch with her. It seemed the two of them had a lot in common. But it wasn't long before Bill Owens discovered what Sy was doing behind the scenes and there were hundreds of unaccounted for prints from the machines, so he abruptly fired Sy, who was simply devastated. He was allowed to finish out the week, then that was it; That night he was reviewing pictures dropped off by a Maya Burson. Suddenly he came across a photo of her making out with Will Yorkin! He was cheating on Nina! Sy was torn up inside. He felt as if it were he who was being cheated on. He then pulled the old switcheroo and hid the photo in the prints dropped off by Nina. He expected Nina to find the photo, and have a fight with Will and break up with him. Sy followed Nina home that night to make sure that happened. It didn't. Sy was disappointed. Nina had long suspected her husband of having an affair, and this picture was proof positive; Next, Sy stopped at the Owens' house and took a whole roll of film worth of pictures of Bill's daughter (one snapshot per second) to intimidate Bill, then to even further intimidate him, he dropped the photos off at SavMart. Bill angrily tried to bar him, but it did no good. Next, Sy follows Will and Maya to a fancy hotel.When the pictures are brought to Bill's attention by fellow photo lab employee, Yoshi Araki, Bill was more than intimidated he was livid. He called in the feds. Detectives Van Der Zee and Outerbridge were now on the scene. They put an ABP out on Sy, while the police who search his apartment find Sy's wall covered in photographs of the Yorkins, only on every single photograph, Will's face had been etched out; At the hotel, Sy disguises himself as the room service bellboy and breaks into Will and Maya's room. He then whips out a hunting knife he had stolen from SavMart and forced them to get into perverted sexual poses as he took their picture! After that, Sy went back to his room. Just then, the detectives were closing in on Sy, but Sy was sly! He made a break for it, leaving the knife and camera in the hotel. He ran out the parking garage, thinking he was in the clear--when suddenly he was ambushed by the police. Sy was incarcerated while his pictures were collected as evidence. Detective Van Der Zee wanted to know why Sy did everything he did, and well, Sy just innocently took pictures. Pictures tell more than words. Sy had considered himself a member of the Yorkin family, and what Will did drove him further over the edge. He tried to break up Will and Maya and bring him closer to Nina. It didn't quite work that way. I guess the lesson to be learned here from our story is use a digital camera, or else the guy who develops YOUR pictures may just take a shine to YOU.Well, One Hour Photo. It's a very good movie. It's very well done, it really makes you think. It's a good psychological thriller. It plays with your mind. Robin Williams was GREAT as Sy Parrish. You know, he played another character named Parrish in Jumanji Alan Parrish; Also here, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Dylan Smith, and Gary Cole as that lousy Bill Owens; SavMart very closely resembles Wal-Mart, and you'll notice the colors most used in this movie are white and blue. Almost everything is white and blue. I guess that's because those are the colors of Sy's uniform. Sy is supposed to be looked upon as evil, but he's actually a good guy. Will and Bill are the bad guys. That's what makes this movie so good you root for the bad guy. Anyway, if you haven't already seen it, check out One Hour Photo today! Mark Romanek and Robin Williams have definitely developed a classic here! See it today!!- "}{"Title":"Pretty believable","Date":"26 April 2005","Score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" I saw this movie both in theaters and on DVD, and I found it to be very entertaining both times.

One Hour Photo is the story of Sy Parrish (Williams) who works as a photo developer at a local superstore. His isolated life and abusive past stimulate him into forming relationships with his customers through the photos he develops. One family in particular he favors, having developed their photos for several years and seeing all of their memorable moments (wedding, birth of their son, etc.). Williams begins a fantasy relationship with this family and imagines himself as Uncle Sy. The desperate desire for Sy to have a normal social environment with love and support is terrifically supported and conveyed through his deluded idea of what each photo represents. When Sy realizes that the perfect family in the photos is anything but, he goes further awry.Williams does such a good job and director Mark Romanek superbly unveils how ordinary-looking, everyday people in our lives could be otherwise and an unsuspecting threat. The film had such a creepy feel afterwards and felt possible too true, that I don't think I could muster a second viewing.

Although Sy is the good guy in it all, he still holds an immensely creepy and Norman Bates-esque air about him and his actions.

The film is gorgeously filmed and executed. In fact, the two big stars here are Robin Williams as Sy and Writer/Producer Mark Romanek, with Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth winning Best Supporting role. The film looks and feels simple - deceptively so. The colors, visual and sound effects, and even some snippets of music are derivative of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey. But Romanek quickly takes us from wariness over these parallels to a comfort zone of acceptance, as he unfolds the similarities between Kubrick's HAL 900 computer and the Sy as played by Robin Williams. Sy, like HAL, is an intelligence so detached from the human race that he can not connect to others except through a third party communication medium - his pictures. Like HAL, Sy is excellent and precise at his job (photo developer), but becomes consumed by the perfectionism he perceives as required to fulfill his niche in life. Sy's progression towards insane actions accelerates when he is pushed over the edge by a trauma that threatens his world. He, like HAL, becomes completely immersed in his version of reality, to the extent that he no longer see nor understand the consequences of his increasingly radical actions as he focuses in on an isolated ideal that ultimately means the destruction of his carefully constructed immediately family.Be sure to arrive in time to see the beginning of this movie in order to be properly set up for the progression of events, as the beginning and ending make a satisfyingly complete loop, perhaps leaving us with a little more compassion and understanding after having met Sy.

You probably prefer dung to urine and probably prefer cheerleaders to poets.I know that nobody will get the same meaning fom the film, but everyone should get basically the same overall picture.  This film goes into an often untackled issue uncompromisingly.  That issue is that there are those who deserve the cake and get the dung.  There are some who get the cake who want the other cake, and then the other cake, followed by extra cherries. While some may think that Sy is actually insane.  I think this film portrays him as a loner who has lived such a torturess life that he finds other people's hapiness, in order to hold on to the idea that hapiness exists. The real shock was that he did not commit a single horrific crime.  He really did not even invade the people's privacy, he just kept a record of what he already saw.  I think this film goes deeper than what I got from it, but the basic point of the film is that we should never take the moments of hapiness for granted. We should strive to live life they way it looks in our family photos and not the way it looks compared to the movies.

Not here however, it is clever, inventive, and damned chilling. As a matter of fact, this film has a few of the most disturbing scenes I have ever witnessed in the history of my watching film.

The so-called twist at the end of the film is unsatisfying as it fails to properly re-contextualise what has gone before; instead it merely throws in some back story that provides a deeper psychological motive for his actions. There is no gradual culmination of threat/suspense to engage the audience, rather the narrative progresses almost immediately from the inciting incident (protagonist loses his job) to his initial act of retribution (threatening photos of his bosses kid in the park) to his final act of mania in which he forces an errant father of a picture perfect American family to engage in a mildly degrading photo shoot (at knife-point) with his second, illegitimate lover. Then he is arrested and confesses to having been abused as a child. I felt this climax (the revenge photo shoot for the fathers infidelity, which we learn retrospectively to reflect his experiences as an abused child) should have been stronger. It wasn't dark or inventive enough to illicit any real emotional reaction - in me at least - and centres around the two characters who have been developed least (consequently, we care about them less). Nothing really culminates in this scene that has been adequately seeded earlier in the movie and fails to take one by surprise. We know he's gonna do something dark from the first act. When it finally happens it is over in minutes and fails to subvert any expectations the writer may have chosen to inculcate in his audience. Robin William's performance is alright - it ain't that demanding a role for the guy to be honest. I.e. it doesn't require anything from him as an actor that we haven't seen him do before.

It seems to consist of little more than forced, awkward little conversations and encounters between Sy and members of the family he obsesses about, in which Sy is too familiar, too friendly, too knowing, and the family members don't quite pick up on this - although there's always the chance that Sy will go just a hair's breadth further, and they will. This is just painful to watch. Mark Romanek doesn't yet have the skill as a director to make any of his early scenes come to life, and apart from establishing the fact that Sy is not entirely right in the head, and doing so too obviously, he doesn't seem to know where he's going. (It must also be said that even throughout the excellent final hour Romanek's competent but sometimes ill-judged direction is the biggest enemy of Romanek's fist-rate script I wish he had used music, if at all, as music, not as a cheap horror movie sound effect; that he'd kept the camera still while showing us Sy's collection of photos of the Yorkins, rather than zooming in on them; that he hadn't included a brief dream sequence straight out of Hellraiser.) At the start of the film it's hard not to be disappointed. One Hour Photo has an inspired premise; it deserves inspired story-telling.Which it ends up getting. Romanek creates something far more interesting and affecting out of his premise than I'd dared hope. The moment that jolts the film from mediocrity to brilliance is the scene in which Bill, the Sav-Mart manager, calls Sy up to his office to fire him. We keenly feel what a terrible thing this must be for Sy. We'd already known that Bill was a prick. When there was an altercation between Sy and the machine repair guy Bill had coldly reprimanded Sy about starting fights in the store, without bothering to find out who started bellowing first (it was in fact the repair guy, not Sy), or what the dispute was about (it was about something important, and Sy was completely in the right). Bill attacks Sy and undermines what little power he has in the cruellest way he can. And the manner in which Sy gets fired is likewise cruel. A decent human being - and one doesn't get to be manager of a shopping complex by being a decent human being - would have at least given Sy a choice about whether to continue working for the rest of the week, or not (without, of course, making Sy's severance salary or back holiday pay dependent on how he chose). The conditions under which Sy is expected to come to work for the rest of the week are intolerable. Not that his work conditions had been tolerable beforehand he'd been forced to wear humiliating clothes, all but coerced into providing a poor service (we admire him for resisting), not once been TREATED like a human being, and made to set up shop inside a shopping mall more hideous and dystopian than any I've seen in Australia - I suspect more hideous and dystopian than any existing in the USA, either, although in either case it's only a slight exaggeration of reality, and in years to come it may not be an exaggeration at all.From here on the film doesn't set a foot wrong - until, perhaps, the final moment. I think it was a mistake to have Sy tell the police (but mainly the audience) about his childhood, explaining his subsequent behaviour by letting us know he was abused as a child, all too neatly adding (one can imagine Sigmund Freud ticking off the one remaining item on his checklist) that his father used to take photos of him doing degrading things. I'm not saying the scene doesn't work. Robin Williams didn't need to deliver this speech at all, since already in this film he'd gained our sympathy far more than he ever had in the past - but it must be said he delivers his lines movingly. And it's good that the policeman questioning Sy was given the chance to behave in a civilised manner, and nice for a change, in an American film, to see such civilised behaviour, rather than the usual fascist brutality, held up as an ideal. But we already knew that SOMETHING about the first part of Sy's life had been unhappy. Best to leave it at that. We can speculate if we want to. Besides, Sy's unhappy early life, whatever form it may happen to take, is only part of the story. Just as important, if not more so, in understanding why he went over the edge are the years of slavery he spent at Sav-Mart.

Sy's obsession is fairly harmless at first, but his behaviour becomes more erratic after he is sacked from Savmart and after he discovers that Will Yorkin is having an affair with another woman.One Hour Photo is, much like the development of photographs, a rather slow process. It essentially introduces us to Parrish and slowly starts to establish his psychological mind- set. Parrish is a lonely person, a man who longs for family and friends which I feel is something that he believes many people take for granted (which is what part of the film is about). Parrish's job is perhaps the only thing that's keeping him going as I think that getting brief insights into people's lives is a way of taking his mind off his own lonely existence. This becomes evident when Parrish gets sacked which is ultimately what brings his darker side to the surface.Robin Williams is better known for his comedy roles, but it's worth noting that he is also very good in dramatic roles - he plays a creepy character in Christopher Nolan's Insomnia and is excellent in both films. Williams gives an edginess to his character that makes him fascinating to watch even when the pace lags a bit in the first half. This isn't the first time he's taken on a complex character and his versatility as an actor is something that he'll long be remembered for. The supporting cast were all OK, but it's definitely Robin Williams who makes this memorable.I'm sure that many people have come to their own conclusions on what was actually going on in this film; was it all fantasy? Was some of it real and some of it fantasy? I think it's safe to assume that at least some of it must have been in Parrish's head as it's revealed on at least one occasion that what we're seeing isn't actually real.No matter how you look at this film there's no denying that it is an interesting and somewhat disturbing look on the way loneliness can affect individuals in extreme cases. The picture has a simmering slow-burning tension to it and when Parrish catches up with the adulterous couple towards the end it's actually quite a chilling sight. Fans of psychological thrillers or character studies will almost certainly enjoy this film.

Sy knows all of his regular customers and memorises them by what photos they regularly come to get printed, But Sy has an unhealthy obsession with the Yorkin family.The Yorkin family is a happy family of three, mother Nina her partner Will and their young son Jakob. Mother and son have been using that lab for 7 years getting their prints to the point Jakob calls Sy 'Sy The Photo Guy' unknown to them over the years Sy has been printing off separate copies of the photos to put on his wall.Mid way through the movie we see the descent of Sy, from the helpful man to stalker, always seems to be there, reading the same books and has a fascination of being known as Uncle Sy and work his way in the family unit.After an incident at work Sy is fired, and realising he will never be in the family unit he starts to up the ante in being top stalker... After discovering Will's infidelities he goes all out in letting everyone know...If your after a thriller horror with loads of jump scares and gore this isn't for you, but its more for people who appreciate the classic thriller using great cinematography and intense atmosphere "},{"Title":"Sympath for a obsessive psycho","Date":"25 October 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" This is a underrated psychological thriller about a one-hour photo lab worker named Sy that is obsessed with a family, that he develops photos for. Now what really drives this movie, is how it delves into Sy's mindset and what makes him tick. Now Robin Williams did a phenomenal job playing this character. He was believable as a psycho and yet still carried that teddy bear vibe, if that makes sense. Robin Williams played another role where he plays a psychopath during the same year, in the movie Insomnia. But there is more sympathy for his character in this one, because despite it not really delving into his backstory. You as an audience member can sense where the character is coming from. Near the end, the plot seemed to drag slightly but that is only a small gripe. Besides that this is a existential and in-depth movie that deals with loneliness and memories. How some memories we try to hold onto while others we learn from it but want to forget. And how this can have an effect on a person.

It you haven't seen the film, it's about a man who processes film and turns them into photos. Early on into the film we find out he is obsessed with a family who comes into to have photos developed regularly. Robin Williams does a fantastic job as this character, and I can say it is one of his best performances. The rest of the acting is pretty good, and the child actor did well for a child actor.What really makes this film stand out is the directing. Mark Romanek is very talented and I'm surprised he hasn't had more well known films come out. The story is very uncomfortable, as it is told so well. This is one of those films that you can love but not ever want to watch more than once like A Woman Under The Influence or maybe Requiem for a Dream. This film is definitely worth watching. There's a lot of really well placed symbolism if you watch carefully. The only real issues I have with the film might be the pacing and little plot details. I feel like the music might have been overused and some scenes good have benefited from more silence. One last interesting point about this film Trent Reznor actually composed a soundtrack for this film, but the filmmakers decided not to use it. A lot of this music went into the Nine Inch Nails album Still. "},{"Title":"Amazing. Robin Williams plays the perfect creep","Date":"6 August 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" I had always wanted to watch this movie because i had seen so many Robin Williams movies but not this one. This movie is sharp, creepy, weird, thrilling and really, really good. I am still thinking about it days after watching it. Some of the film is even left to interpretation by the viewer so there is even more to figure out. The movie is about Sy, a photo clerk at a super store. Sy(short for Seymour) played by Robin Williams is a typical man in his 40's/50's that is a nice, lovable, loser that lives alone. His loneliness turns him mad. He becomes obsessed with a family (Nina, Will, and Jake) that regularly gets their photos developed by him. He makes copies of their photos and puts them on the wall of his apartment. He is so lonely that he dreams of being a part of this family. He buys the same book that he sees sticking out of Nina's bag at the store. At first, he wanted to be like an uncle to the family but then later on he wants to marry Nina and get rid of her husband Will. One of the creepiest parts of the movie is when Sy watches the family's son Jake (Dylan Smith) play soccer from the sidelines and acts like an uncle.Sy eventually gets in trouble for using the extra film to make the copies of the family photos and gets fired for it by his boss (Gary Cole). Sy completely loses his mind at this point, and is determined to get rid of Will by filming his infidelity. Without giving it all away, the ending is wild. I would say the first half of the movie is better than the second but I'm nitpicking.8.5/10 Very intense, very creepy. Williams at his best in my opinion. Not necessarily his best acting but his best character fit. Kudos to the director and supporting cast as well, it was very well done. Thrilling atmosphere and excellent music. This movie is gripping partly because its so cringe worthy at times how weird Williams' character is and how obsessed he is. Humans can be such odd creatures when they are alone for too long.

He makes extra prints and imagines himself amongst them as uncle Sy while plastering his apartment walls with photographs. He also knows that the husband id having an affair because he examined the photographs. He is an intruder who hides his knowledge behind a friendly smile. Great setup with analysis of his work and home life leading to a powerful ending. Director Mark Romanek graces the film with shots that suggest invasion of the mind. Powerful performance by Williams whose profession is both his doorway to acceptance and his reality to consequence and instability. Connie Nielsen is also strong as the mother whose romantic void is obvious when Williams knows what she doesn't. Michael Vartan as her husband needed more depth but he receives his regret in the most deliberate fashion. Gary Cole plays Williams's boss who pushes him to the limits.

When he passed on, I witnessed quite distraught, hysterical reactions from some fans online. A few were even espousing the idea that Patch Adams & What Dreams May Come were decent films after all. While I'm not a big fan, I really enjoyed his turns as Popeye and the voice of Aladdin's Genie. The man had bags of energetic comedic talent, and his drama skills were pretty good too when not too sweetened with hardcore-saccharine. Yet the most effective comparison with a dramatic actor from his peership is when we consider Dustin Hoffman's turn as Tootsie vs Robin's effort in the Mrs Doubtfire outfit. The latter actor being for the younger and/or more sentimental type.This rather long introduction is just to explain that I generally wasn't fussed about his output, but One Hour Photo intrigued me...and more than a decade after release I finally get to see it. Biggest reason to watch/best thing about it the character Robin creates here is genuinely believable. He's a living, breathing human being...damaged by his utter loneliness. It's an impressive performance and for me justifies his efforts back then to sell himself as a more serious & versatile actor.The film itself is rather simple, with the rest of the cast blandly portraying 2-dimensional characters. Gary Cole was only given a formulaic role to play, he could've done something special if the writing wasn't so singularly fixated on Robin's character. The family are all a bit yawn. The experience as a whole is mildly-absorbing, if unremarkable. Technically everything is quite competent, tho' again it's all very standard.The premise of the story is stimulating if, like me, you enjoy photography and are engaged in the many facets of the digital-vs-analogue debate. Some might feel the ideas here are outdated already, but there's still plenty of people out there who shoot film and then let their local store develop the images. Plus when the premise really is outdated in a decade or two, this movie serves as a reasonably-accurate snapshot of that era.Recommended for film buffs looking for a very different Robin Williams performance, and also for those interested in the potential illusion of privacy when allowing your analogue film to be developed by strangers.Not particularly recommended if all you're looking for is a gripping psychological thriller, it's just a little too average.

However, after now watching it for the first time since it's release and actually paying attention, it is definitely much better than I initially thought. The film is pretty slow-paced - that view's not changed - but when you pay attention, and understand & listen to what is happening, it doesn't feel all that slow as you become more drawn into the story, which is well written.The story isn't full of implausible moments, it doesn't have that Hollywood touch about it, and isn't full of the usual stalker film clich√©'s. I also enjoyed how it got you thinking if some of the later scenes were for real or if they were just in Sy's head. I mean the first main fantasy scene wasn't obvious until it's end, so maybe other scenarios weren't real either. It never confused you but it got you thinking which was good.The cast all do a great job with their roles, but Williams was the main standout with his performance of Sy. You know that Sy is obviously completely in the wrong with what he's doing but you still feel sorry for him and this is where Williams plays the part SO well. He doesn't make Sy seem like some clich√©d sick twisted psycho...he portrays Sy as just a very nice but a sad, lonely individual whose only friend in life is his pet hamster. No matter what happens during the film, you just cannot feel any hate towards Sy.I sometimes don't notice the way scenes are filmed in movies at times, but the use of the colours to depict the mood for different scenarios was done well I thought. The main instance here being the difference between Sy's own personal world i.e. in his home, compared to that of the Yorkin's. It's not done for the sake of it nor to be artsy, but done with reason which adds to the overall feel of the film.This isn't an amazing film, but it is enjoyable.

Someone needs to suffer for it to be funny. Thus it should be no surprise that comedians are more than capable of pulling off more dramatic and even outright depressing roles. One might even say they're perfect for them.Enter one Robin Williams, playing the role of Seymour Parrish. Or, as most people know him, Sy the Photo Guy. A deeply lonely man, his life consisting of nothing else than serving his customers at the local photo kiosk and watching television. Things take a turn for the worse when we find out he has developed an obsession for a particular family, called the Yorkins. Sy has lived his lived vigorously through them for years, but now he has finally turned a leaf to full stalkerdom.And thus begins our movie, and it is about as uncomfortable as you can imagine. It's one thing when an obviously creepy and scary man is doing the stalking, but it's quite another when it's someone as sympathetic and lovable as Robin Williams. You know you shouldn't root for him, but it's Robin Williams, and that creates great tension in the film, when usually such a jovial guy just stares at this little boy, offering him toys.Where the film falters slightly is the execution of this great idea. I don't blame the director however because he really wanted the film to be longer, but unfortunately studio meddling got in the way and thus the whole film feels slightly rushed, especially towards the end. I get the sense that the situation was supposed to go on much longer and thus the twist at the end of the second act would have come as a much bigger shock.As a whole One Hour Photo is definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of Robin Williams seeing that it is such an unusual role for him. It's also a decent psychological thriller on its own. It's well-acted, well-shot and the story, while rushed, is not too shabby either.

He knows much about his customers through the photographs they have developed. But he knows more about the Yorkin family - specifically Nina Yorkin and her adolescent son Jake Yorkin, the two in the family who drop off and pick up the family's photofinishing - than anyone else, the family about who he is obsessed. Nina's husband, Will Yorkin, is incidental to his obsession since Sy has only seen him in photographs. Sy's obsession includes fantasizing about being their favorite Uncle Sy. He has even been making an extra set of prints for himself of all of their photographs since Jake was a newborn. After an incident at work and after Sy finds out more about the family through a set of photographs, he decides to right the injustices he sees in the only way he knows how. His actions demonstrate his true mental state. Roger Ebert wrote Watching the film, I thought of Michael Powell's great 1960 British thriller Peeping Tom, which was about a photographer who killed his victims with a stiletto concealed in his camera. Sy uses a psychological stiletto, but he's the same kind of character, the sort of man you don't much notice, who blends in, accepted, overlooked, left alone so that his rich secret life can flower. There is a moment in Peeping Tom when a shot suddenly reveals the full depth of the character's depravity. In One Hour Photo, a shot with a similar purpose requires only a lot of innocent family snapshots, displayed in a way that is profoundly creepy. One Hour Photo' is not a film for those who like their chills heavily laced with bloodshed, murder and mayhem. It is, rather, for those who can appreciate a quietly unsettling, yet strangely compassionate glimpse into the dark recesses of the troubled mind.

One Hour Photo is exactly that kind of film.Robin Williams plays Sy, a man who works at the one hour photo place at a Walmart type store. The issue is that he starts to become obsessed with one family in particular that gets their photos developed by him, and it becomes clear very early on that Sy just isn't right in the head. Williams plays this character unbelievably well. He comes across as totally crazy, but in a down to earth way. The best part is, he is completely sympathetic too. Although you know he's messed up, you can't help but feel the pain this guy has deep down. Williams perfectly executes this and it's great to see. In particular, a scene at the very end that I won't spoil has Sy indirectly telling another character about something that happened in his past, and it's pretty heartbreaking to see. I think the performance also has another amount of depth to it due to the recent suicide of Williams, and it makes you wonder if that sadness that he shows in his character is something that he channeled from his own feelings. Very sad, but an amazing performance.The movie is quite well shot. The scenes in the store are very white and feel sterile in a way, and the scenes in the family home have a warm tone to it. There's lot of great uses of color throughout, like the red developing room being used to emphasize a characters emotional state. There's also a good dream sequence that is disturbing and memorable. Overall, it's a pretty wonderful film to watch.I really like how this movie plays out. It slowly builds up the characters until about the one hour mark, where things start to really kick off and the build up pays off.

Most acting comes from at least 'some' part of the actor as they are the one acting the part. Just saying on that note. But this was truly a great film, one of Williams' best performances for the sheer fact that he never showed this side of his acting very often, but also just because it was a terrific performance. There is a twist at the end of the film, not so much a twist to the story, but a twist to the character and how we view him after learning the twist. Everything about this movie rides on the twist at the end. Any lesser film and the twist would have been contrived/forced, and basically phony. But the subtle way the twist unfolds with the great writing and the top level of acting William's gives in the moment, the twist unfolds very naturally.

This is truly one of the most underrated and overlooked movies to come out in recent years and it really shows Mr. Williams' acting abilities when it comes to being immersed into a chilling character.The story line, though goes off the beaten path a few times, showcases a good amount of suspense and atmosphere to keep it engaging. What makes One Hour Photo a standout from most thrillers in it's genre lies in it's avoidance of the usual clich√©s and nuances which makes the twists and turns all the more effective. It quietly studies the main character of Sy Parrish whose bleak sense of loneliness carries the film throughout it's well-written plot. The pacing may leave some viewers underwhelmed, but it is well worth it when given the proper chance.All of the actors do a pretty good job with their given roles, but it is ultimately Robin Williams who steals the show. The psychopathic portrayal of Sy Parrish shows the level of range Williams has as an actor. Unlike most characters in thrillers where it's easy to identify the good guy from the bad guy, the character of Sy is not so easy to distinguish where you might end up feeling both disgusted and sympathetic towards his motives. Regardless, Sy is a quiet, subtle character to study for and is one of the more memorable performances from Robin Williams' career.The use of lighting and cinematography brings in a chilling atmosphere that show you the bleak world of Sy's twisted fantasies. All the shots can range from blank to dark within the story and it really is a fascinating work of film to look at. The musical score also adds a nice touch of suspense to this already engaging thriller.In the end, One Hour Photo will remain of the most underrated thrillers of the last 15 years and I hope it will continue to get the recognition it rightfully deserves. The engaging story, creepy atmosphere, and a strong performance from Robin Williams makes this film worth recommending.

In this case, the pictures of the Yorkin family which Sy has done for years has given him such pleasure that he sees himself as he puts it in 1 creepy scene as UNCLE SY. It's remarkable to see Robin Williams who I've loved for his remarkable turns in Aladdin, Jumangi, Flubber and other comedies to be playing such a lonely, sad and perhaps sympathetic character. He is amazing in showing his loneliness, especially in his scenes at his home and how he sees himself as a member of his family by saving a copy of all their pictures in that frightening collage in his house. His silence and sad isolation from everyone is chilling, and then Williams' expertly explodes in 3 powerful scenes which you will know once you see them.In addition, the film doesn't tun into a slasher like I first feared when Sy is fired and takes the knife from the Savemart. Instead, it's a red herring and the director and Sy lead us down a curvy path where he gets revenge on his boss by doing what he says a snapshot originally was,  a hunting term. There's another scene where Williams sits in his car near the Yorkin home, and we see him stealthily going through it. The director amazingly is able to confuse the viewer into losing track of what's real and fantasy, and though Williams' is only talking to the dog watching TV in the living room the effect of the scene makes it feel wrong, he shouldn't be there and honestly this along with the eyes' scene were the films creepiest moments and no blood/gore was needed. Connie Nielsen is great as is Dylan Smith(Jake) in showing how even such a happy family like them has issues, which the director teases wonderfully between Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin till Uncle Sy sees the truth himself in the photo lab. He then take sit upon himself as he later says, due to his anger at Mr. Yorkin for neglecting and abusing his family to expose him to his family and what better way then with a picture which says a thousand words.It's a shame that Williams' didn't get more acclaim for this part,though Ebert and others(2003 Saturn Award) saw what myself and others did.

Yes, his off-screen act seems to be a repetitive act of doing the same schtick over and over, but in the movies, he always takes chances. For me, there's never been a bigger risk to one actor than his performance in One Hour Photo. Williams plays Sy Parrish, a bland, smiling salesman at a one hour photomat that occupies the corner of one of those vast Mega-marts where you can buy everything from toothpaste to radial tires. As a human being he's pretty forgettable. He is just another face mixed into the tapestry of your busy day. You do your business and then he is gone from your mind three seconds after you stuff your receipt in your pocket and walk away.Looking at Sy, one would assume that he goes home to the wife and kids, but as it turns out, his only family is his beloved photo-mat. There isn't anything really distinctive about Sy and as we follow his day, as he goes through the routine of routine we see that a pattern of loneliness has bred routine and resentment and obsession.One day during the visit by Nina Yorkin (Connie Neilson), a regular customer, Sy carefully notices that there is one picture left on the roll. Holding the camera back he takes a picture of himself. This seemingly innocent gesture is, for Sy, a gesture of recognition. What Nina doesn't know is that over the years Sy has developed a sort of obsession with the family bliss that shows through in Nina's photographs. He wants Nina and her family to recognize him and he tries to get their approval in small gestures like giving Nina's son a free camera and making double prints free of charge.The Yorkins, Will, Nina and 8 year-old Jake are comfort food for Sy, they contrast sharply with his den of loneliness and routine. Their photos show a pretty family which stands out among the regulars like The Cat Lady, a woman who obsessively empties roll after roll of her cats and The Amateur Porn Artist, the shifty guy who keeps taking nude photos of his girlfriend. Sy fantasizes about being part of the Yorkin family and breaking away from his meaningless life as he wanders through their photos of birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, vacations and family bliss.Then, something happens. A young woman drops off photos of herself being intimate with Will. It is here that Sy's vision of the Yorkins begins to crack. Attempting to sabotage the affair, Sy accidentally drops the photos of Will and his lover into Nina's photo sleeve hoping that Will gets his comeuppance.When he doesn't get the reaction he expects, Sy comes unglued. It would be criminal of me to reveal what happens next except to say that it isn't what we expect. What I can say is that Romanek balances the routine everyday nature of the first half of the film with an ending that is just as balanced so that everything that happens makes complete sense.This was the second time in 2002 that Robin Williams had played a psychotic. The first was in Chris Nolan's Insomnia. There, as here, Williams shows portrait of a man whose frustration bubbles slowly under the surface as the irritations of the world begin to invade his private comfort zone. Sy wants to remain in his fantasy and as the fantasy and the reality begin to cave in around him you can see him desperately trying to patch the holes and keep the illusion alive.Williams' performance is, at first, understated with quiet passages that allow you to watch his eyes and see that he is always thinking. Sy is the portrait of a man who remains invisible and remains very good at his job because it allows him to keep his illusion going. Routine is a manner of remaining inside his fantasy because he knows that he can never have the life that the Yorkins enjoy.Robin Williams image will forever be cemented as the wacky nut that we saw on The Tonight Show, yet as film historians assess (especially in the wake of his tragic death) this contribution to film, his dramatic work seems to be just as important as his comedic work. Sy is an original creation from a source that we don't expect. Sy emerges as a man who smiles pleasantly while managing routines that feed his own mania.In a way Sy reminds us of Travis Bickle, the tortured soul of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, another meaningless soul who goes unnoticed and fixates on an obsession. Bickle wanted to be the savior for Iris, the teen prostitute. Sy wants to live the idea of an idyllic fantasy that is different from the hundreds of meaningless photos that pass through his hands day after day. The difference is that Sy wants to remain in his fantasy. He is a damaged man who hides in his ordinariness, and is best left inside his delusion.

Mrs Doubtfire is probably my favourite film of Robin's but I also decided to watch One Hour Photo. This is a film I'd never heard of but the premise sounded intriguing. I was also keen to see how well Robin could do a 'serious' role as I'd only ever really seen him in comedies. I was very impressed with this film. The plot is extremely creepy and thought provoking. The acting is very good and Robin plays Sy the Photo Guy to perfection. He is a very strange character, his actions are disturbing and it's intriguing to find out more and more about this character as the film goes on. The film overall is pretty intense and does well to avoid some movie clich√©s. I felt it was a very unique film in its own kind of way.I was quite surprised to see it rated at only 6,8. I think more people need to become aware of this great little film.

Since it's a dramatic thriller, sinister behavior's a sure thing.Otherwise, it unfolds in an unanticipated manner. Therefore, it's difficult to draw correlatives without spoiling.It's written and directed by Mark Romanek; as of yet, the first in his two-feature career.People seem to forget Robin Williams's range as an acting talent. Aside from the voice of Genie in Aladdin, amongst a slew of other impressive roles, his achievements are featured prominently in Good Will Hunting and What Dreams May Come.Williams stars as Seymour Sy Parrish, a photo booth attendant with a suspicious proclivity.Connie Nielsen turns in an excellent performance as Nina Yorkin, a frequent customer of the one-hour photo development lab. Nielsen's had a long career in the film-biz. Unfortunately at first glance, her cinematic history seems unremarkable.Her most noteworthy role is that of Lucilla, Commodus's sister in Gladiator. Now that you think about it, she's very good in that, yes yes?See how easily the notion's misplaced?Nielsen's acting chops really shine through here, but her performance is easily forgettable in the midst of a confusing tale, daunting subject material and a powerhouse protagonist.Sy's workplace is a satirical version of Wal-Mart located in a suburban mall, but the setting's of minimal concern.(Side Note If you can find me a Wal-Mart that's half as clean, organized or well-staffed as this Savmart, I'd&#x85;well, I'd never believe you.)The only necessary contextual reference is the plot's unfolding upon the cusp of digital photography. Sy's occupational necessity teeters on irrelevance.Two types of people will enjoy this Film buffs and psychology scholars. As a piece of commercial art, it's impossible to ignore the story's merit.This is a tight, well-crafted ninety-five minute film. Priority lies with painting a clear picture of a character coping with a contemporary existential crisis, not with polishing the narrative veneer.But, should you see it? Why not?Spoiler sensitive types. stop reading here!In particular the photo development process is masterfully shot and edited beautifully. The sequence shimmers as a fountain plume of knowledge, and a cornucopia of succulent eye candy.Speaking of ocular capability, the disturbing nightmare remains a mystery to me. The scene's certainly there for a reason; I simply can't discern the purpose at present. But Romanek's first feature's such a sterile and meticulous craft I don't need to revisit the material. Its purposeful placement is fairly supposed.Nuance glimmers in the details, after all.And that's what I like about this movie; the hint of fairy dust twinkling amidst shadowy corners.During an early moment, Nina comforts her son Jake (played by Dylan Smith) who voices concerns about Sy's loneliness. Lying on his bed, Nina reassures him by suggesting they close their eyes and generate good thoughts on the photo attendant's behalf.While the scene unfolds, Jake fiddles with an 'expanding sphere' toy, and it resonates thematically with the larger narrative. As the boy expands and contracts the plastic mechanical star, their positive energy's injected into the metaphysical ether. Isolated from Sy's physical presence, the pair still generates good will for him, when nobody else is.The cosmic microcosm resonates with the later discussion of Deepak Chopra and the expanding/contracting of the universe.Another revelatory moment takes place when Sy walks the boy home from soccer practice.In this scene, Nina's son illustrates a mature level of even-handedness most adults can't muster. Without a trace of judgment, Jake accepts Sy's gesture of friendship. The boy welcomes the attendant's company, just like he would a schoolmate.Subjective audience members are acutely aware of the danger in Jake's actions because of potential instability in Sy's mental faculties. Stepping back and ignoring that bias reveals no immorality or cause for suspicion in the protagonist's actions.Up until Sy offers the action figure, he hasn't technically committed a moral transgression. But Jake's refusal of the gift draws a line in the existential sand. The boy's commitment to honesty is of significantly less concern than the alternative implications.In a way, this choice to decline is the catalyst allowing Sy's ultimate redemption. The film culminates in a realm of moral obscurity; perhaps otherwise, that wouldn't be the case.The action figure represents an unspoken power shift. Instead of being two human beings standing on equal footing; Sy tempts the boy with an unachievable material gain. You might call it 'forbidden fruit.' No matter what the phrasing, a 'gift' still represents a tangible exchange.And I'd also argue it shows Sy at his weakest. Luckily for him, Jake makes the correct decision on both their behalves.A refined detail is the framed mirror with the reminder to 'Check Your Smile' in the Savmart locker room.Even the means of self-evaluation, the lens through which Sy can inspect himself, lies in the shadow cast by the judgmental puppeteers of higher-tiered society.I never do this but I'm going to cheat by parroting the conclusion from another review.Because, hey, it's succinct.Elaine Cassel concludes, Movies could play a more productive role in explaining psychopathology if the sources of twisted behavior were explained realistically and compassionately, as they are here. One Hour Photo is a rewarding study of abnormal behavior and one that psychology students should appreciate, if not enjoy. It leaves us wondering, and caring, now that we know what's wrong with Sy, what will happen to Sy.Brief, yeah? Hope it helps!

I don't know exactly what it is, but this movie was just really good. Before this movie, I never considered the fact that the people at a one hour photo place looked through our lives, saw the places we've been, and the people we've encountered. To me, the thought doesn't make the workers creepy, but their jobs in general feel quite invasive. This film also made me realize that we, as a society, can be very blind to those who we take for granted. For example, Sy the photo guy is clearly obsessed with Nina and her family, yet Nina just sees it as a passion for what he does. She just doesn't notice all the little things Sy does for her. Instead, she simply takes it as quality customer service. Is she na√Øve, blind, or just uncaring towards this meek, insignificant photo guy? Robin Williams does a fantastic job portraying the inner psyche of a scared (and creepily meticulous) young boy who is trapped inside an awkward adult.

He has equally impressed me in a dramatic role, and, to me, this is one of his finest performances of this type. The trouble with someone like Williams is that he has a famous (or infamous if you like) past and you tend to remember him for those things. But if you can see the character beyond the actor then you're most likely going to enjoy the performance a lot more.Seymour Parrish works in the one hour photo processing department of the SavMart store. He has worked there for many years and has seen many customers come and go, but one family, the Yorkin's have been coming back for ten years. They are Nina and Will and their nine year old son Jakob. Unfortunately for them, Seymour, or Sy as he prefers to be called, has become very attached to them through their photos over the years. So much so that he even fantasises about being a member of this perfect family. After an unfortunate event at work and while processing some photos Sy discovers that the Yorkin's are not as perfect as he imagined. As you can probably imagine, this does not go down too well with Sy. I won't say any more so as not to give any spoilers.A really well made film that I found quite atmospheric in places. A great performance from Robin Williams as Seymour Parrish, I really felt he nailed the part! Also worthy of note were; Connie Nielsen as Nina Yorkin, Michael Vartan as Will Yorkin, Dylan Smith as Jakob Yorkin, Erin Daniels as Maya Burson and Gary Cole as Bill Owens.There is a really great commentary all about photographs and what they mean to people that follows through the first two thirds of the film. It is read by Robin Williams as Sy and it really adds character to the film. Although not perfect, I did really enjoy this film and in particular Robin William's performance. Over all, a tight psychological thriller that does what it says on the tin&#x85; Recommended.My Score 7.1/10 "},{"Title":"An Interesting Watch!","Date":"15 February 2011","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Mark Romanek's 'One Hour Photo' is an interesting watch, due to it's morbid yet absorbing story.

Robin Williams stars as a middle aged single loner, Si Parrish, who works in the photo development lab at a supermarket. He lives his life dealing with memento's of events which others wish to remember, their photographs. But is it to replace that which he wishes to forget? Williams is terrific. Quiet, creepy, with just a hint of menace and violence he insidiously works his way into the lives of a perfect couple, possibly replacing his own less than perfect past life, past and present, with theirs.Connie Neilsen and Michael Vartan play as husband and wife , Nina and Will Yorkin whose superficially attractive life collapses as Parrish finds the cracks. The sets are limited, mainly a shopping mall, the Yorkin's home, and a Hotel giving the feel of a stage play, and it is the script, the words, the dialogue which dominate.The final act is strong, yet still Director and writer Mark Romanek pulls his punches. The sexual dimension which could easily have been gratuitously exploited, isn't. The violence which simmers under the surface is not fully realised. The only truly unexplored element is why he surrenders everything in a Pyhrric victory. Photographic, framing and picture allusions abound both obvious, and subtle, and the one and a half hour running time is perfect for the story. Romaneks previous work has been mainly with Music Video which will have helped with the stylised presentation and limited sets, but to his credit he also shows an ability to tell an extended narrative outside of his milieu.Although this falls short on the sex and violence and edge of your seat tension stakes, it is nonetheless satisfying in its own right and can be looked back on with pride by all involved. "},{"Title":"A Nutshell Review One Hour Photo","Date":"15 November 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" I grew up with Robin Williams movies in a way, watching him on the telly with his Mork and Mindy series when I was a kid, and following almost all his films should they make it to the big screen here. Everyone knows he's quite the live wire comedian, so it's probably groundbreaking each time he gravitates towards more dramatic, serious fare such as Dead Poets Society and The Night Listener, with even rarer turns as negative characters, such as that in Christopher Nolan's Insomnia, and One Hour Photo.Written and directed by Mark Romanek, the film has as a central character, somebody in the background, easily forgotten, never a hero and frankly someone that we don't really care about unless we know them personally prior. Robin Williams junks his jokey side, and plays a quiet loner who works at a megamart as the one-hour photo lab tech guy who processes your photographs. Yes it's Year 2002, so cameras of the digital type were not that prevalent, and surely a film with a premise of this nature probably can no longer use this setting because it doesn't exist, at least not in a widespread manner. If you, like me, have seen the demise of this part of the photo industry, may have a tinge of sadness since you're likely to have built up some keen rapport with the person who through the development of your film, likely to have entered your personal circle of trust.And part of the brilliance of the film is how detailed it is to show how films were processed back then, from the small film roll into negatives on which photographs get printed on. William's Seymour Sy Parrish narrates this delicate process, which tells us his personality and his approach in life, chillingly meticulous and taking pride in his profession to deliver the best of his services, where memorizing facts and figures of his customers seem to be part of his edge in delivering customer service, never betraying that hint of misappropriation where he siphons off extra prints of the Yorkin family photos to feed his obsession.Working 11 years on the same job, he has seen the Yorkins - husband Will (Michael Vartan), wife Nina (Connie Nielsen) and son Jakob (Dylan Smith) grow in the community, and they soon become his family of choice, a unit that he craves for but knows he has missed the boat and can never enjoy what this family has in its ties. So the next best thing is to creepily collect mementos, and plots to be as close as he can to members of the family, stalking Nina even and trying extremely hard to connect at any level through a little bit of ingenious social engineering.A lesser story will have this degenerate into something of the Fatal Attraction kind, exploiting Sy's loneliness into something dangerous and threatening the family direct. But here's where Romanek's story succeeds in providing a breath of fresh air, where that tinge of danger becomes a suspenseful thriller, keeping us constantly wondering just what sort of edge does Sy get pushed over, and rolling his disgraceful past into the mix as well in one fell swoop, in desiring his utopia of what a family is to be maintained at that virginal level, keeping it perfect.It didn't go down the road of the mediocre or the typical, but kept things open especially in the final moments of conversation between Sy and detective Van Der Zee (Eriq La Salle), where we get the rug pulled from under our feet, yet allowing things to swing either way, depending on whether we desire to sympathize with Sy, or prefer that it be something more bleak than it already is. One thing's for sure though, with the advent of technology, the potential for something like this has moved from the photo-studio where a select few employees have privy to the photos you send for development, or this gets unwittingly revealed through the lack of securing our digital photos on social networking sites.Robin Williams is a one man tour de force, and he disappears effortlessly into the role, hidden behind the shy, lonely facade, becoming somewhat of an an eerie avenging angel type who sees his utopia being destroyed, and wants to do something about it. And the misc-en- scene gets carefully crafted to support this, from the music, sets and the spot on creation of mood that gets to crawl under your skin. His performance alone is astounding, and he totally owned the role and made this film come alive. Watch this to see what Robin Williams can do outside of comedy, and for Mark Romanek story and dare in taking Williams out of his comfort zone. Recommended!

Robin William's plays one such developer in a plot that owes much to Hitchcock, but avoids falling into the trap of ripping him off. That, plus a little emotion, and a great dramatic performance from Williams deliver a fine thriller, occasionally flawed, but I can easily recommend it.The key to the film's effectiveness is of course its subtlety, which is broken in the finale a little bit, but it doesn't harm the drama. Robin Williams can get tiring as a comedian, but his dramatic roles are always solid, (Good Will Hunting, Insomnia, The Night Listener). Here he is deliciously creepy. In the same way that kids are scared of Grandma cause they don't wanna get smooched, there is something very intimidating about the pacifism and extreme pleasantness of Williams' character in this motion picture. Part of it of course has to do, with the fact that it becomes increasingly obvious that he is more than a little bit nuts.I was told that this film was generally panned, which I find a bit hard to believe. Yes, it has its faults, and to some the plot may feel stagy and hard to accept, but I liked the film a lot for what it was. If you want a good thriller, be sure to check out One Hour Photo.

He is obsessed with the Yorkin family, whose photos he has been developing since the son, Jake, was an infant. Having no life of his own, Sy parks his car outside the Yorkin house, runs into Mrs. York at a mall food court, and makes extra copies of their photos for his wall at home. Then he discovers, through another customer's photos, that Mr. Yorkin (Alias star Michael Vartan) is having an affair.There is a surprising lack of dialogue in this film and some very stark cinematography, which points up Sy's isolation in the world. The film is very well done.One quibble I have is when Sy's boss (Gary Cole) questions Sy about the discrepancy in prints sold versus the excessive amount of prints made by the AGFA machine. Given how long Sy has been making extra copies, it seems strange that someone is just noticing this now.Williams' acting is excellent, proving again that many comics can do drama very well. Eriq LaSalle, formerly of E.R. plays a police detective.Without Romanek's fine touches, this would have been on the level of a Lifetime TV movie. Thanks to his sense of style, it isn't.

Robin Williams can give a very good dramatic performance when he is given a good script, but in this film he goes to a completely different level. He literally transforms into Sy, and the result is a weak, although dangerous character who we genuinely feel sorry for.I am not sure if anyone has made this comparison before me, but when I watch this film, it reminds me a little bit of Taxi Driver, both Travis and Sy are lonely, their motivations are completely different of course, but both these films are essentially character portraits that deal with loneliness.

It may seem slow at first, but by the end the tension is so potent that the viewer will be unable to move. One Hour Photo is like that, and the lion's share of the credit has to go to Robin Williams.Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is an extremely lonely man who works at the One Hour Photo store at the SavMart (think WalMart). His only moments of happiness are when the Yorkins come to drop off and pick up their photos. But Sy's affections aren't just because he's a nice guy, he is obsessed with them, imagining himself as Uncle Sy. But Sy is also very unstable, and any crack could make him dangerous.Robin Williams made a career in comedy, but he also has a great talent for drama. This is easily his best performance. Sy is anti-social to the extreme, but we can also see a bit of ourselves in him. All of our insecurities feelings of loneliness are present and exaggerated in him. The other cast members are great, but this film belongs to Williams.Mark Romanek is a a terrific director. The film is perfectly paced, and the tension builds to a nearly unbearable level. But the film's look, helped by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, is one of this film's most unique and helpful attributes. The too-bright lights of the store, the use of pastels (especially white) and the overly positive jargon of big corporations, is all reminiscent of Wal-Mart. Yet, there is also a tone of darkness underneath it all, and that helps increase the tension. Lighting in a thriller hasn't been used this well in any other movie I have seen next to the The Descent.

He elicits sympathy from the audience and really is a towering presence in terms of his acting throughout the film.The Yorkin Family played decently by Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen & Dylan Smith are integral to the plot and each gives convincing if not outstanding performance, after all the film centres around Sy and his obsessive behaviour. Gary Cole as Sy's boss is okay, and he helps in pushing Sy over the edge.Also I have to applaud the fledgling movie director Mark Romanek, his minimalist approach to the sets and Robin Williams appearance paired with the very dark material worked exceptionally well. The sombre and thoughtful mood of this piece is great as it moves slowly but very deliberately through the story and covering some disturbing territory.This is a truly masterfully directed and acted movie and credit goes to the pairing of Romanek and Williams in pulling this off. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Mark Romanek snaps Robin Williams' mind","Date":"20 July 2009","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Lonely department store One Hour Photo guy Robin Williams (as Seymour Sy Parrish) lives vicariously through the pictures he develops for what seems like the perfect family Full frontal father Michael Vartan (as William Will Yorkin), beautiful wife Connie Nielsen (as Nina Yorkin), and their cute nine-year-old son Dylan Smith (as Jakob Jake Yorkin).

When Williams discovers Mr. Vartan may not be the world's best father, he goes Psycho.Excellent direction by Mark Romanek, complimented by Williams' creepy performance; this film succeeds in maintaining a quiet, mostly suggestive horror throughout. There are some ways it could be tighter. Some examples Maya's pictures (who took them?) should have been suggestive solo shots of the couple, which Williams intends to unite in the hotel room. Jake's perceptions about Sy are alluded to early on, but never expanded; they are confirmed by an excellent point-of-view shot of Williams' car in his rear view mirror. There is no follow-up. This should have been the moment the boy convinces his mother the man is a dangerous stalker.

He should have stayed doing these sorts of roles.One Hour Photo is a story of obsession and loneliness, about a sad man who just craves acceptations. The plot of the film is about Sy (Robin Williams), a man who works in SavMart (a Walmart/KMart type department store) on the photo booth. Sy is a man who takes great pride in his work and likes to get to know his customers. There is one family he takes a particular interest in, the Yorkins. During the film he becomes more obsessed, making his own copies of their photos, looking at them when he can, placing them on the wall of his flat and even said that he is an uncle to Jake, the son of the family. He is obsessed because he sees them as the prefect family and wants to be apart of it. He goes to such extremes to stalk the family, and fantasises being apart it. However, he discovers that the family isn't as prefect as he first thought, and he world falls apart, losing his job and sets out to get revenge.As I said, the main themes of the film are obsession and lonely. Robin Williams and writer/director Mark Romanek show this very effectively, and very real. It was very believable. On the outside Sy seemed like a nice friendly man, who just cared about people. However he really is seeking acceptation and company. Slowly during the film Sy becomes more psycho. Mark Romanek did a very good writing job and his director showed skill. They were good acting performances from Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Gary Cole and Dylan Smith. However, most of my praise has to go to Robin Williams who does give a very chilling performance and should do more serious roles. Some scenes were unconformable to watch, but that was the reaction that the audience is meant to feel. The film does loose it a little in the final act, but I feel Romanek did handle the film well and it works well. I recommend it if you like this type of him.

Robin Williams is just fantastic as Sy, and definitely deserved an Oscar nomination. His chilling performance really made the movie. He is a very sympathetic character, alternating between detachment and forceful anger. The direction and supporting cast were very good, if not great. The dialogue was well done, and the use of contrasting colors added to the film's intense atmosphere. If you like psychological horrors, or just good movies, give this one a shot.I give One Hour Photo a strong 8/10. I have it as #93 on my top 100 list. If you liked this one, definitely check out Kubrick's 'The Shining' and try 'Panic Room'.

It cuts both ways; the happy group inside the lighted window, the figure in the long grass in the orchard seen from the train stay and support us in our dark hours. One-Hour Photo is a film about someone who invests almost all of himself in other people's lives. Sy Parrish works behind the photo counter of a large suburban supermarket and has spent the last twenty years of his life developing other people's snapshots. Sy is a lifelong bachelor, with no wife, family or romantic interest in his life. His one passion seems to be for his job, which he takes very seriously, doing his utmost to ensure that every customer receives a perfect set of photographs. He prides himself that his laboratory is the best mini-lab in the state, and his philosophy can perhaps be summed up in the following words- And if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations, it's this I was here. I existed. I was young, I was happy, and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture. Sy might seem like the perfect employee, but there is a darker side to his character. He has formed a great attachment to one particular family, the Yorkins- handsome dad Will, pretty young mom Nina and their cute young son Jake. He does not just see the family as customers- he has befriended them and appointed himself their Uncle Sy. What the Yorkins do not know is that Sy has, over a number of years, been making an extra copy of every photograph they have brought in to him to develop and has been using these copies to decorate his flat, where he has several hundred images of them stuck to one wall. In Sy's eyes the Yorkins are the family he never had, his one source of happiness in his humdrum existence. And then, suddenly, his life changes. He is sacked from his job and- even worse for his peace of mind- discovers that Will is cheating on Nina with another woman.The film, superficially, falls within the stalker genre which was popularised in the late eighties and early nineties by films like Fatal Attraction and Single White Female. When Sy discovers that his adopted family are less perfect than he had imagined, the emotional world he has constructed for himself is destroyed, and he decides to seek revenge. Unlike many stalker films, however, One Hour Photo contains a strong satirical element; it can be seen as a satire on suburban life not unlike American Beauty. The Yorkins are an All-American suburban family so eerily perfect they could be taken straight out of a commercial. Although the film was shot in the Los Angeles area, the identikit homes and shopping malls could be set in the suburbs of virtually any American city. This idea of suburban conformity is emphasised by the film's bland and impersonal visual look. We can all think of films (Girl with a Pearl Earring and Far from Heaven are two recent examples) where virtually every shot looks like a painting. One Hour Photo, with its hard, glossy look and vivid primary colours is a film where virtually every shot looks like a family snapshot. What surprised me most about this picture was not seeing Robin Williams playing a villain, as I had previously seen him in Insomnia (also made in 2002) and as a fanatical anarchist in The Secret Agent. What surprised me was seeing Robin Williams playing an introvert, as I had always associated him with brash extroverts, such as the motormouth DJ Adrian Cronauer in Good Morning Vietnam, or the inspirational teacher in Dead Poets Society, or the eccentric actor who disguises himself as his own children's nanny in Mrs Doubtfire. Here, however, he is completely different. Sy is the archetypal grey, anonymous little man, a reclusive, working-class, middle-aged bachelor, hardly noticed by the rest of society. His name Sy is not short for Simon but rather Seymour, a pun on see more. Others may overlook him, but his job enables him to see rather more of their lives than they might wish, and it is this which gives him a surprising amount of power. Even though this part is so different from the sort of roles I have come to associate with Williams, it is nevertheless one of his best. Unlike some characters in stalker films, Sy is never allowed to appear simply as a villain. He may be a creepy, dangerous obsessive, hovering on the brink of madness, but we are never allowed to forget that he is human. Williams and writer/director Mark Romanek portray him with sympathy and compassion. He is perhaps one of the casualties of the suburban lifestyle, a man whose obsessions have their roots in loneliness and in alienation from the privileged, seemingly picture-perfect lifestyle of families like the Yorkins. Watching Williams's brilliant portrayal of this alienated loner, the question that came to mind was the one originally posed by the German writer Hans Fallada in 1932, one year before Hitler's rise to power, Kleiner Mann, was nun? Little man, what now? 8/10 "},{"Title":"the darker side of robin williams","Date":"29 January 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" I never thought that Robin Williams of all people could pull off this role, well i was amazed at how un Robin Williams like he was in this,, i mean he's a standup comedian by nature,, Mork $ Mindy,, i grew up with that,, then you had Insomnia, Night Listener,, so yeah i really liked this one a lot . the premise of a story based on a One Hour Photo guy, heck i ain't never seen that done before,, so kudos to the writers,, director , producer, and the studio for picking something fresh and different for a change.. the movie paced very well,, i loved the sexual undertones during the movie,, some of the quotes are keepers too, i love the one where Robin Williams' characters says,, someone actually cared enough to take this photo of me... that is very deep.and of course the Oxford English Dictionary quote,, i love how the young boy seems to figure Sy out.. when no one else really can. this film was eerie,, kinda creepy,, but very interesting, and definitely one of a kind,, a big thumbs up,, especially for Robin Williams..

The film is a slow building piece that leads up to the final, surprising revelation. The entire time I was wondering what drove this man to become such a loner, living vicariously through this seemingly perfect family and when we finally get the answer, I just sat in numbed silence. It's very rare when a film can shock me to the core and just leave me laying there, numb, throughout the entire experience. I was being knowingly haunted yet I couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. Everything about the film, from Williams' shockingly horrifying (in a good way) performance to the frightening, atmospheric score. I really can't begin to describe how much this film shook the core of me. I can rarely think of a time where I was so disturbed by something so subtle. They could have made the ending some outrageously huge deal, but they made it subtle and realistic. In the end you can't do anything but pity this character and sympathize for him. He's just a man who was wrecked and deeply disturbed in his childhood which led him to such an alienated life. Being this photo processor allowed him to live vicariously through what he believed to be the perfect family. But of course no family is perfect and when he loses this perfect image of them, it throws him over the edge in one of the most disturbing displays of a deranged mind I've ever seen.

"},{"Title":"It'll make you think twice about getting your photos developed...","Date":"5 November 2007","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":" Mark Romanek is a successful music video director who is making his first leap to feature film with this intriguing, albeit slow-paced, character study. The film revolves around Seymour 'Sy' Parrish, a one-hour photo clerk harboring a dangerous obsession with the Yorkin family, whose photos he has developed for many years. The last person I would have foreseen being cast in the role of Sy would have been Robin Williams, a man known primarily for his off-the-wall, cartoonish performances. After having watched this movie, I can picture no other actor wearing the blue Sav-Mart vest. The character of Sy is a very restrained, emotionally warped individual and this role shows the range of Williams's skill. Sy is probably one of the more fascinating characters in recent years. Despite his creepy, overbearing, and occasionally threatening behavior, it's hard not to sympathize with him and his obvious struggle for acceptance.Another aspect of this film I really enjoyed was the visual style brought to it by the cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth. I loved the sterilized feel of the hyper-white aisles in Sav-Mart and the use of green and red filtered lights in some of Sy's scenes. In my opinion, this is probably one of the most aesthetically appealing movies from 2002.My only real complaint with the movie is the slow-pacing. There were points near the middle of the film where it almost felt like came to a complete stop. It didn't help that there were some scenes that seemed completely out-of-place and interrupted the film's flow (i.e. I still don't understand the relevance of Sy's nightmare). Thankfully, what the film lost with its pacing it made up for with its casting. Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith have great chemistry as the Yorkin family, the object of Sy's attention. Gary Cole (Bill Lumbergh from 'Office Space') has a minor role as the manager of the Sav-Mart and Eriq La Salle (of 'ER') makes an appearance as an agent of the local Threat Management Unit. And, of course, Robin Williams's fantastic performance as the disturbed one-hour photo clerk.This film brings us unseen depth from Robin Williams and a compelling story from a first-time filmmaker. The pro's heavily outweigh the con's in this independent gem and make it worth at least one good viewing.

I keep telling them that main stream Hollywood movies are rarely subtle... they hit you on the head on all fronts, visual and musical etc. etc. A good example of that is Photo. It is not a bad film but after the first 10 minutes you know where it is heading and from there on there is no escaping the stock characters, the stock situations and the stock explanations. Too bad because there is good acting and clever sets. Also, the last minute redeems the movie a tad because the ending, while using a rather hackneyed explanation for the hero's behavior still leaves us puzzled as to what the final resolution of this story is. This is not a bad thing as it gives the viewers further entertainment and mind stretching as they write their own scenarios after the curtain has fallen and the movie is discussed over coffee....

Sy states to Jake that he's one of the good guys, however, in the movie End of Evangelion, they are really not.Sy, I'm guessing, is suffering from depression during this movie, and therefore is in some relation to Evangelion's Shinji Ikari (in which GAINAX's Hideaki Anno had suffered, therefore creating an anim√© with the main character with depression).Also in this movie, we see Sy resting and having a dream with endless shelves... eventually a scary sight with the eyes bleeding profusely. Then seconds later, the Mass-Produced EVA is standing on a nightstand. Think of End of Evangelion, where Asuka Langley gets speared with the Spear of Longinus into her EVA's left eye, where she feels the pain. This spear, before transforming into Longinus (which the real one is on the Moon), was the weapon that the action figure has in hand, therefore the action figure is truly a bad guy, not a good guy.As Williams said in the commentary on the DVD, Evangelion is one of his most favorite anim√©... and the figure is one of his own from his personal collection.For being an EVA and Williams fan, this gets some serious attention and thought. 10/10 I give it.

This picture-like movie to me was a reminder of how good a life I live, of how good I really have it going. It reminded me that I fail to understand and appreciate this on a daily basis, that I fail to recognize that the warmness of my home, the love from people around me and the overall good that is the result of all this, is something I neglect and pay very little attention to. As did the picture-perfect family in this movie. And here is where the true meaning of One hour photo lies it's not a story about a psychotic, neglected and non-social little man that took comfort in pretending to live a different life. It's about showing how even the ones that have it perfect don't always know how much they should be thankful for it...and in some cases even mess it up completely. The more I think about it, the more I actually see Sy as a sort of personified, flesh & bone guarding angel. The soft and white tones of his hair, clothes, car and apartment further help make my point. When at the end of the movie he actually got into the position where he could have committed a serious crime, he instead punished the swindling couple by giving them both the lesson of their lives and left without a sense of guilt whatsoever. And as crazy as it sounds(even to me at this very moment), he was almost entitled to do what he did. Throughout the whole movie he was the voice of everybody that is less fortunate, of people that suffer through their lives and hope and dream of living a better one (hence his immense obsession with the Yorkins), and he was more than justified to act he merely gave a reminder, nothing more and nothing less... ...It's a reminder that I'll need to be taught over and over again to respect, love and appreciate what I've got. Kissing the ground I walk on should become my daily habit!)7/10 The movie I can compare this one the most is definitely Hard Candy, especially for the very real and possible story, as well as for the immensely brilliant aesthetics and detailed perfection of them both.Highly recommended, especially on a very laid-back night.

Sy has an unhealthy fixation on the seemingly perfect Yorkin family loving mother Nina (a fine Connie Nielson), faithless, neglectful husband Will (the solid Michael Vartan), and sweet son Jacob (adorable Dylan Smith). When Sy gets fired from his job and discovers that Will has been cheating on Nina, his idealized perception of the Yorkins gets destroyed and he goes off the deep end into total despair and madness. Writer/director Mark Romanek relates the chilling and arresting story with exceptional precision and assurance; he does an especially expert job of vividly evoking a totally mundane and believable everyday working class reality which in turn makes the considerable suspense that much more powerful and gut-wrenching. Moreover, the central theme about violation of privacy and how loneliness can cause someone to go crazy adds additional resonance and even poignancy to the plot. Williams' astonishingly complex portrayal of the creepy, anal and obsessive, yet tragic and pitiable Sy holds the picture together and keeps things engrossing throughout. Kudos are also in order for the sterling supporting cast Gary Cole as mean and overbearing store manager Bill Owens, Eriq La Salle as diligent detective James Van Der Zee, and Erin Daniel as Will's fetching mistress Maya Burson. Jeff Cronenworth's sharp, sparkling cinematography and the shuddery, pulsating score by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Kilmek are likewise up to par. A superior thriller.

I suppose it's a truism that victims like Sy the Photo Guy eventually become the perpetrators of the crimes to which they were once subjected, but writer/director Mark Romanek is to be applauded for bringing a fresh slant on this fact. Robin Williams, in probably the best performance of his career, achieves just the right degree of contained, buttoned-down creepiness as Sy, a guy we all recognise. Sy's a loner, an invisible man living in a colourless world with only a hamster (as trapped as he is) for company.Well&#133; a hamster and 800-odd snaps of the perfect Yorkin family he has filched from his employers. The Yorkin's family life is that which Sy aspires to, but which he can never have, so he contents himself by enjoying it vicariously through the snaps he develops for them. In their photos he sees a golden-hued utopia, as diametrically opposed from his sad, lonely life as it is possible to get. As his obsession with them threatens to topple over into violence and begins to impact on his own life, Romanek subtly manipulates our emotions and confounds our expectations before devising an ending that manages to satisfy the audience while still leaving loose ends.This is the kind of film you want to watch twice, so that you can pick up on all the clues and subtle hints that are so easily missed on first viewing.

He was really engaging as someone who was lonely and no one in his life. His only life was being the photo developer at Save-Mart (obviously, Walmart). He secretly keeps photos of his customers (and knows a lot about them). He loves his job, and is likable with his customers. Trouble begins when he starts delving into the personal life of a family that he has film developed for. Williams' character can't stand the fact that the father is having an affair. He decides to take action in his own hands. After all, in his delusional mind, he is the uncle of the family. The movie really shows how lonely and abandoned someone can be that they have to dream up a family life of their own. Gary Cole plays the boss. He is not likable and a bit too bossy. At one point, Cole tries to bar Williams' from returning to the store after being fired. There was no cause for this at this point. Williams had done nothing yet. The thing I didn't like about this film was that it never really committed to anything. Was he a total nut case without redemption? Did he have an agenda that was important? What was the point of the film? What is the film trying to say? I think the creators of the film were intentionally trying to blur this, because in today's World life is complicated and motives unclear. The best illustration of this blurring is when William's took pictures of his bosses's son and sent them to him. Williams may have been threatening his family, or just simply trying to show that he has power and control. That may have been the point of the movie. It is never entirely clear - people's motives in today's World. The movie could have done a better job though giving the audience a direction to work with.

In my opinion his best acting yet. The movie does an amazing job of pushing a feeling on you. In parts you just feel uncomfortable watching and creeped out, just wanted to yell, STOP BEING SO WEIRD. The shots the lighting the acting and the music add together to make you get this strong feeling, feeling exactly what the movie wants you to feel when it wants you to feel that way. That being an important part of a movie it does a perfect job, the movie also left me with a kinda memento aftermath feeling after I was done watching it. Leaving me to think about what I had just saw like the movie memento did, thuo probably less strong of a feeling. It gave me that puzzle piece falling together conclusion by the end you just thought about all the little details that all added up it was perfect, like a thousand threads making a perfect piece of cloth. It gave me the same aftermath feel as memento but didn't give me the constant headache memento did through out it, considering the movie was all backwards. For it being a relatively low budget film and a break out for the director it was a perfect piece of art, and should be enjoyed by allot more people.

What I enjoyed most about One Hour Photo is the structure and pacing; people looking for cheap thrills won't get it at all, but it builds on the blatant creepiness of Sy until you really worry about what he's capable of; and the resolution is perfectly sequenced. Eriq LaSalle perfectly underplays the dispassionate 'family man' cop. There's plenty of suggested back story too - it seems as though Sy was a victim of the worst thing you're afraid of ... has already happened, ie kiddy porn in his abusive childhood in this context, which explains his utter social incompetence, yearning for 'proper family' and drive to act out the abuse once again. Why not a 10? Because er, perversely, I think Robin Williams, although impressive beyond what you might expect, is ever so slightly over the top. Many who found it boring have commented that they didn't believe the basic plot premise of a nosey photo guy for a second, and Williams is so very creepy from the start that you do wonder, in an otherwise 'realistic' film, why nobody comments on what an absolute creep he is, though the manager seems glad to be rid of him... I kept thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire (who also wouldn't have fooled a myopic crack addict for a minute). But the unusual premise, superb direction (the escape sequence in the hotel, for example) and excellent soundtrack had me hooked; this film is clearly a cut above as a thriller while addressing a serious issue intelligently. Hitchcock, eat your heart out.

I am very interested in anything Mark Romanek now directs. Everyone will be interested in this suspense/thriller; for different reasons.Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan are also very good as the victimized couple. What is interesting is the understated film technique, acting and theme of this film.I was fortunate to have seen the screening for this movie, as well as the director's comments. Cy Parrish (Williams) is a disaffected photo processor in a local Wal-Mart type store. I loved him in this role, yet the fact that he pulled it off is testament to his ability.Connie Nielsen and her son are the objects of obsession for Cy. While nothing is ever completely explained- that is what Romanek has portrayed so brilliantly. This film is like real life in that- you may encounter people every day- yet do not know/assume what they are thinking.Most of the theme is portrayed visually- a brilliant move on Romanek's part. Whatever has happened to Cy as a child, he clearly wishes for a family now- we see the bleak, sad life as he drives home from work in his Ford Focus; he is a reliable decent worker, but something is awry.Gary Cole is amusing as the anal-retentive store manager (similar in Office Space) he tells Cy (a 50+ year old man) people come in to save 10 cents on a pair of socks- this is retail. The true banality of corporate America exposed.Eriq DeLasalle portrays the detective of the Threat Management Unit who investigates Cy.This film is suspenseful, well-acted, and not predictable.

His job allows him to be a sort of fly on the wall to people's lives,as they entrust their private photos,which seems to amuse him as well as feed his knowledge and curiosity,about both film AND people. He develops an attachment to a handsome,upper-middle class family named the Yorkins(Michael Vartan,Connie Nielsen and Dylan Smith)and prizes the calm,sanctity and seeming normalcy of their relationship.So when he discovers,through developing a roll of their photos one day that the father is having an affair with a co-worker,this begins to rip away at what Sy has treasured. Given his already tenuous grip on reality and low sense of self-identity,the damage becomes incrementally frightening.Where Insomnia had Williams in an almost unbending menacing role(hope I'm not giving anything away there!),One Hour Photo takes Williams down a much subtler,more sympathetic path. You could feel empathy for him at any point of the movie. You could do it with OR without feeling any dread or any sense of menace about his character.And,of course,you could JUST find him simply creepy,too. The YorksWill,the cheating,seemingly above-it-all dad,Nina,the reserved but vulnerable wife and Jake,the kid(who seems to be the only one that shows even a vague suspicion about Sy's quirkiness,though even he seems to be more amused than scared) are prefect counter-balances and surrogates for the audience,as we slowly begin to realize what kind of obsession is at play here.The summary title comes from a theory I've had since I first saw the movie in theaters on first releaseI have a funny feeling this movie could've just as easily been translated in a film-short and not been any less effective,but as a full-length feature,this takes on layers that make this film a more viscerally effective piece of fiction. Director and writer Mark Romanek has created a great first-effort film,with characters that are flesh-deep and real and images(particularly of the cold fluorescent-lit department store)that are as haunting as they are mundane.

We live in a society that values privacy, but nevertheless we leave ourselves more naked than we would like to think -- and this is a prime example. Because customer service representatives have been trained to smile at all times and be of service to their customers, when one of them becomes just a little too intrusive for comfort, no one notices. At first.This is where Sy Parrish comes in. Played by Robin Williams who carries the entire movie on his shoulders, he could be anyone, the friendly guy behind the counter of whom we know nothing. A quiet, non-descript man who has no attachments, he could fade into anonymity at any time and would not be missed. Only one person feels pity for him, Jake Yorkin, who frequents the store with his mother Nina Yorkin, and he even expresses it. It seems Sy's a sad man, he says, and he's more than right. Sy is a broken man. Just how broken he is we will find out later on.People like Sy Parrish are bombs of anger and self-hatred waiting to explode and cause irreparable damage. Because of the hurt they've experienced they've become sponges absorbing what they deem orderly and perfect, so once they focus their warped interest on someone else, it's as if they were literally absorbing everything about that person. Mark Romanek doesn't waste too much time in exposing Parrish for what he is -- a creepy stalker -- in one masterful shot of Sy's entire living room wall covered in pilfered pictures of the Yorkin's at different times of their lives, no doubt taken every time they would visit his kiosk to get their pictures developed, as he watches -- stares, fixated -- at The Simpsons. But despite this disturbing picture, there's a sense of sympathy, even if it comes later as Sy's psyche comes unraveling and his actions stem from an act of infidelity that someone else's pictures reveal. Will Yorkin isn't exactly the nicest man around and one scene -- a heated argument between he and Nina, early in the film -- establishes his character as a man tired of his family, throwing it all away for a sordid affair. Does this justify Sy's actions? No, but for a man who only wants to do what's right -- even when he himself deludes himself to believing the book he reads (which Nina is also reading) and the lie of the woman's picture whom he calls his mother -- this is all he knows.Mark Romanek has only done one other movie that I can recall, and haven't seen, but his video work is fascinating. Why this man hasn't done more films is beyond me, because as a visual storyteller whose work is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick. Some of his videos have gone down as the best ever (such as his rendition of the video Hurt or Madonna's Rain). His mastery in pacing this story is evident. I loved that he creates an escalating sense of suspense and dread with the smallest of elements a continuous barrage of photo shoots of a little girl playing in the front yard becomes a predator's way of revealing himself. Shown in quick succession, they become quite terrifying. Also, the way Romanek avoids showing a drop of blood and gore -- internalizing Sy's fantasy world, making his anger only vaguely hinted at, but getting him ever so closer to the Yorkin's with his kindness. Except for the final explanation scene, reminiscent of PSYCHO as told by Sy himself, ONE HOUR PHOTO is an almost flawless art-house thriller of a man collapsing into insanity.

So, I can't really go into too much detail about any of the events in this film, but I will say that it did, at many moments, keep me at the edge of my seat. It's indeed very creepy.However, we seemed to have another case of 'Good movie, bad ending'. It's not as bad as Identity was; in other words, the ending wasn't so bad that it ruined the entire movie; but, it was dumb. This is just in my personal opinion.

And than after he finds out that the father is having an affair and that the family is not perfect he breaks down. This could have been an extremely disturbing and deeply scary film but instead it ends up simply being a little disturbing and a little scary, and thats simply because of the idea, you get scared about the same amount just thinking about it. It falls apart mostly because of the script which while trying to make Sy look like more than just a monster ends up giving him almost no development at all, in other words you don't care about him.

So here we go again. ONE HOUR PHOTO is a near-perfect effort at a slightly different thriller, as a shy and retiring photo clerk (Williams) working in a Wal Mart-type store fantasizes about living out his life with a young family who are frequent and familiar customers of his store. Williams is magnificent as the very creepy Sy the Photo Guy, who makes an extra set of every batch of negatives the family drops off for processing. His home is a shrine to this family. Problem is, he then decides to take things a step further, and from that point the film enters Twilight Zone territory. The ending proved extremely controversial. Some folks loved it, some hated it, but no one was indifferent to it. I have very mixed feelings about it myself. I find it almost anti-climatic. See the film and decide for yourself. And then let me know what you think. The white and pastel motif of the store and Sy's wardrobe is extremely interesting, and reminded me of the whited-out imagery from Williams' previous flick, INSOMNIA, in which he played a very devious serial killer. My favorite scene has Sy sitting on the floor of his photo studio, but I will say no more so you may enjoy the scene as it plays out. I will tell you it is a major turning point in Sy's evolution from voyeur to stalker. One big flaw in this otherwise highly entertaining film Connie Nielson's bizarre and distracting hairdo. It actually does go with her quirky personality in this quirky film, but still it is a major turnoff. Sort of like Harrison Ford's stylized hairdo in PRESUMED INNOCENT. You end up focusing on Ford's hair more than Ford himself in that one. His hair should have been billed separately.

I read in the IMDb trivia that Jack Nicholson was originally asked to play the role of Sy, but that would have made this film into too obvious of a Shining rip-off. Robin Williams' convincing and compassionate acting as Sy bent the film in a different direction. He is much more subtle than Nicholson, who we can imagine as being constantly at the boiling point in many of his other roles. Williams delivers a feminized performance, where even his victims, being held at knifepoint can't seem to be dominated by his weak persona.

It is creepy to hear the first-person narration, and awe at how Robin stayed in character; when he jokes in this movie, it is very eerie. Romanek uses the locations very well throughout the film such as when Sly gets a photo at a yard sale even though she has been in Sav-Mart  many times before, and had her photos developed by Sly, you can see her nervousness around him has not faded. In fact, the main characters are very much alike they present a certain face to hide their true feelings; Nina wears stylish clothes and high-heeled boots to stand out from everybody else, and maintain a image of being the picture-perfect wife. The director also takes advantage of his background in music videos in a sequence at the Yorkin's house. The musical score is very good.

One Hour Photo is the tale of a lonely man who's obsessed with a young family, most likely because as their photo developer he's seen all their happy pictures and wants so much to have that in his own life. And yet can't, so is fixated on them. Williams' as 'Si the photo guy' is superlative at portraying an apparently normal person whose demons run deep and who is disturbed by his own obsession. Connie Neilson oozes class as as the mother who seems to have the idyllic life, and Michael Vartan is suitably distant as the father whose work seems to stop him being as much of a family member as he should be.The pace of the movie is unrelenting, and although it *is* a short movie it seems to go by in minutes.

I don't think so. Although he's excellent in his role as Sy the Photo Guy, he still excels at doing comedy in movies like Mrs. Doubtfire. Photo is music video director Mark Romanek's first movie was writer-director, and it's very distinctive that it is. It's hard to explain, it just looks like a rookie operation.Williams plays Sy, a photo clerk at SavMart, a Target type place. He loves his job very much, and his customers more so. His favorite family includes the Yorkins, Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan) and Jake (Dylan Smith), who Sy thinks is a perfect family. He makes extra copies of their photos for himself, and in his apartment he has a wall filled with their cherished memories. However, Nina and Will are on shaky ground, presumably about money, but we can't really tell. When Sy realizes this, and something else that's quite obvious, he doesn't like how he's been misled. And he gets angry. This shy soul doesn't like that, and he's going to do something about it.The greatest pro and the greatest con both involve Romanek's script. Romanek has created almost a fantasy world, where it seems that everything is going right. The story is so original it seems like it could have been a true story. The character of Sy rings so true, it shows that we all know a Sy somewhere in our lives, yet we don't take the time to notice him. However, the supporting characters were some of the most uninteresting I have seen in a movie this year. I didn't care about the Yorkin family one bit. Not only that, but there was no development of the Yorkins. What did Will do that we were supposed to know? We didn't know. What about anything about Nina or Jake? I have no idea. I wanted less of the Yorkins and more of Sy.A reason it is apparent that Romanek is a auteur director is that he expects all scenes that could be thrilling to be thrilling. They could have been made tense but instead Romanek just assumes that we think it is. Although that scene, bound to be famous soon, in the hotel room at the end was, the rest of the movie wasn't. Williams showed yet again how versatile he is; he can star in comedy or drama with perfect ease. He was superb. However, all of the Yorkin family came off dull and flat. Gary Cole, as the one-note boss, was way better than people should be in supporting roles like that. Overall, One Hour Photo is an interesting drama with great lead acting.My rating 7/10Rated R for sexual content and language.

As a result this is a flat, forgettable exercise in by-the-numbers pseudo-stalking.The two things that really bothered me about this turkey#1) Connie Nielsen's hair is so perfect, so salon-fresh, so boldly styled in every shot that it completely distracted me from everything else. I am not usually one to notice details like this, but her hair was so artfully sculpted in proudly-absurd styles (even when she is supposed to be fearing for the life of her husband) that I had to laugh out loud. #2) Michael Vartan, who plays father Will Yorkin, manages to create NO character whatsoever.

People bring their film to him to be developed in the SavMart.And although he's nothing more than a smiley face to them, they are much more to him. He knows them all, their quirks, their joys, and their families. In fact he runs off an extra copy of family photos -- children playing, wedding ceremonies, vacations, the usual dull stuff -- and takes them home and tapes them across an entire wall of his apartment. When he's not watching The Simpsons (a family show) on TV, he's sitting back in his chair glowing with pleasure as he looks at his wall.Not that he's entirely happy. He laments the fact (in a literate and observant narration) that if we were to judge families just from the snapshots they take, it would be misleading. People just take snaps of joyous moments. They neglect everyday subjects like the used bandaid, the wasp on the jello, the edges of the sofa cushions -- things nobody pays attention to, like himself. What a well-done movie for a first-time director. One notices first the use of lighting and color. The SavMart in which Williams works is all fluorescent light and sterility -- the dominant hues are blue, white, and cream. The only advancing colors we see, warm reds and oranges, are associated with the family that occupies most of his attention, the Yorkins. His home, like his workplace, is so sterile and tidy that it makes an ordinary space look like McSorley's Old Ale House.The family snaps bloom like a spring garden of flamelike orange. The wall that they cover is the only sign of life in Williams' home, aside from the pet hamster that runs endless miles in its silly circular cage. If the film were any more symbolic it would have to be European. The actors wear matching wardrobes. Williams' uniform is flawless for its purpose. A blue vest, starchy gray shirt and matching tie, gray trousers, and a pair of those ugly plastic shoes with thick gum soles -- all gray. Williams is first-rate in the part, not just his bland professional behind-the-counter smile or his tentative voice but his movements, his body language. It's stilted, stiff, robotic, as if requiring an immense amount of effort to control. The black detective is good as well, if more sympathetic than we'd expect from an ordinary cop. And so is Connie Nielson, whom Williams takes to following around. (Why not?)The director has done a fine job. Camera movements are generally measured pans, and shots are held for enough time for us to absorb their contents. (What a relief after having been so often zapped in recent movies.) The influence of David Lynch, the Coen brothers, and Stanley Kubrick is there -- but not to an objectionable extent. The director is fond of the kind of brightly lighted scenes that Kubrick used to find so attractive. (See the scene between Nicholson and the waiter in the men's room in The Shining for an example of what I mean.) Originality shows in this movie. A less thoughtful flick would have -- could EASILY have -- included the butchery of two guilty people in the nude.Or -- when Williams has a nightmare -- he COULD have screamed, shot up from his bed, and shoved his face jarringly into the camera, but he doesn't. The nightmare, by the way, has blood squirting in buckets from Williams' eyes. There are lots of eyes in this movie. Williams at one point interrupts a lecture on eye surgery. And lots of camera lenses. The only thing that leave me puzzled a bit is the denouement, in which Williams quizzes the black detective and tells him he's a good father, and that he'd never make his children do sick things. Williams' face twists with angry distress as he says this, and the detective comments, I think I understand, Sy. I'd rather NOT understand, if what we're meant to understand is that Williams' father was a child abuser. That's too cheap a shot to fit into the rest of this superior story.

Yet everyone DOES have a life even if for some it is only an inner life.  For Sy it is a typical suburban family who he has known for years due to the fact that he develops there pictures.  His obsession with them grows until it spills over with frightening results.     Sounds like the basic setup for another psycho/stalker scenario and yet it isn't.  This film far exceeds that and in many ways takes it into a whole new level.  At times this film seems much more like a drama or even a sad movie. You actually feel for this Sy guy. He is still threatening, but in a much more complex way.  The director does a very good job at getting you into Sy's emotional state.  The color schemes and music bring you into Sy's world and makes for a lasting impression.  The nightmare sequence is especially well done.     Williams, as Sy, is terrific.  His venture into unchartered territory has proved to be a successful one. His comic persona has always had a sort of 'lonely boy looking for attention' type quality.  He creates a character that has a dark side and yet still shows a lot of humanity.  He gets the viewer to become sensitive with someone they might not otherwise want to.  This creates good tension as the viewer then becomes torn between liking him and fearing him.     If there is anything wrong with what is otherwise an outstanding effort is the fact that it seems to be too rehearsed and neatly packaged.   It's point is too bombarded and there seems to be no opening for a more free form style.  The stylization is strong and at times drowns out the reality of the films main message.     Yet on the whole director Romanek shows a lot of promise.  He respects his characters and doesn't try to exploit them.  His script is intelligent and dark and yet still tasteful and restrained.  His filming and choosing of the young actor who plays the child is good example of this.  He is not overly cute or precocious.  He shows the natural awkwardness of a typical child and yet still conveys a perception to things that the adults don't.  He is a child as they really are.

WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS","Date":"8 August 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Underplayed at times, but like THE TRUMAN SHOW effective in it's portrayal of a world within fantasy, ONE HOUR PHOTO is a truly chilling, thought-provoking movie that capitalises on the current vogue for obsession with familiarity. As the 'Bennifer' show continues unabated in spite of the failure of GIGLI at the US box-office and the reality shows like POP IDOL, BIG BROTHER and such-like are at their peak of popularity, such is the power and potential of cinema to take a look at the darker side of reality.ONE HOUR PHOTO utilises a genuine lack of gore and blood to provide a maximum worth of entertainment from a deceptively simple plot. Robin Williams is at his finest as the lonely photobooth developer who has never known any other job than this one and becomes friendly with a family and results in taking copies of pictures they have sent to be developed. The family in question is actually under strain and Williams' character sees a way to become accepted into the vogue by being even more friendly with the son of the couple in question. I have to admit with the whole issue of protection of children at the moment, which is quite potent in light of the Holly and Jessica murders and with the Bulger tragedy still fresh in everyone's minds after a decade, the scene in which Williams tries to give the son a present made my stomach churn and heightens the power this first-rate psychological drama has.Williams is as far away from some of his more comedic roles and indeed is virtually unrecognizable from the more dramatic movies he has done over the years (GOOD WILL HUNTING, DEAD POETS SOCIETY; admittedly, the latter does have comic moments, but it is more bittersweet than comic!) and it is because of that that he is all the more effective.Compelling. "},{"Title":"great film for its qualities, despite my desire for more character development","Date":"30 July 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  One Hour Photo is a thriller where Robin Williams plays a psycho with a conscience. It's a nicely paced, intelligent suspense film, where its qualities lie on aesthetic qualities, such as pace, soundtrack, and other dramatic elements. This is not a movie that relies on surprise, shock, or intrigue.The plot revolves around Robin Williams' character, Sy Parrish, a lonely and introverted photo lab technician at a SavMart convenience store. He lives his life vicariously through the photos of the regulars who drop off their film to be processed. One of his quips in a long series of narratives interjected throughout the movie, reminds us that, `people take pictures of happy times in their lives. No one ever takes a picture of something they want to forget.' The happier he perceives other people, the more he withdraws from his own life and seeks to be a part of theirs. But it's a special family, the Yorkins - a mother, father and son -- that he most strongly bonds to over the past nine years. He fantasizes that he is their `Uncle Sy', and in his mind, they treat him as such. As his emotional stability becomes increasingly unbalanced, he finally snaps when he discovers a secret that could tear apart the family.What carries the film is the character profiles and excellent visual qualities. The characters reflect their environment cold, stark, and generically plain. Physical spaces are large, vast areas of empty isles, huge rooms, fluourescently lit sterile environments - just like the people. In a sense, nothingness. Yet, there is a lot underneath. And this is where the film's lesser quality comes in.The characters lack is a sense of depth. Psychotics are more interesting when we know their history - we don't know anything about Sy's past, and the notion that he has none takes away more than it adds. There are other conflicts that go untested, which also leaves a sense of incompleteness. (We don't need `resolution', just a sense that an issue is addressed.) For all the empty vastness of the movie that symbolizes Sy's profile, it's a perfect time to add a tiny drop of black paint on a vast white canvas show something that gives us history. Many of Sy's pivotal plot-turning acts are done more for symbolic effect rather than to guide the plot along, and are therefore left with question-marks over the audience's collective head. Why would he do certain things? He's supposed to be cold and calculating, but some of his actions are anything but.One Hour Photo is almost more of an artsy film than a mainstream one, and in that genre, these concerns really needn't be addressed to satisfy its target audience. In the end, I loved the film, and all its qualities, despite my desire for more character development.This is Robin Williams' third film of 2002, all of which feature him as a psychotic. But it's this role that is probably the most dramatic and believable. What makes it even better is that you almost forget it's him soon after the movie begins. For an actor as easily type-cast as Williams, this marks a notable step forward in the breadth of his work.The movie was written and directed by Mark Romanek, most known for music videos; most prominently, Madonna's  1999 video collection. This is his first film, unless you want to count his indie-effort, Static, in 1985, which didn't get very much attention. In One Hour Photo, Romanek uses techniques very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrik - with the ultra-wide-angle symmetry shots, long, quiet scenes, and dramatic pauses between lines to achieve a sense of suspense and psychological drama.  "},{"Title":"A Difficult Movie To Rate","Date":"20 July 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I liked this movie; I'm just not sure how much to be perfectly honest!Overall, I think this is probably the best dramatic performance that I've seen Robin Williams offer. His portrayal of Sy the Photo Guy (obsessed with a family whose pictures he's been developing for years) was probably as creepy a performance as I've seen, made even more so by the fact that the movie contains no overt violence, although there are several points in the movie when you expect it to. It's very much a psychological thriller, and it works very well.Perhaps Williams' strong performance actually hindered the movie in a way, though. The other characters didn't seem well developed. In particular I thought the performances of Michael Vartan as Will Yorkin and Eriq LaSalle as Det. Van Der Zee were weak and unconvincing. The DVD version I saw had an iteresting commentary version of the movie by Williams and director Mark Romanek. (I didn't watch it all, but certain scenes seemed to cry out for their perspectives - in particular the closing scene which leaves open the question of whether it was a fantasy of what Sy wanted or a look ahead to a reality that finally developed. I vote for the former.)In the end, though, I don't think I'd watch this again, and as I rate movies, if I wouldn't watch it again the highest I give it is a 6. So that's where this one falls. 6/10 "},{"Title":"One Hour & Thirty-Six Minute Photo","Date":"20 July 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  I have a friend who will hear nothing good about Robin Williams (and that's cool, because there is nothing wrong with dissenting opinions-in fact I will always welcome the other side of the coin).  Nevertheless, `One Hour Photo' is just another example that proves my friend wrong, and if he doesn't like it he knows what he can do with his opinion.I did not set out to make a brief survey of Robin William's acting career, but `One Hour Photo' prompted me to do so.  Now, the chances are that Mr. Williams will never go down as one of the greatest actors of our (or any time), and rightly so.  However, his contributions to film cannot be overlooked.  I can think of no other comedian that has ever tried his hand at `serious' roles and actually succeeded the way he has.  I mean, Robin Williams does, in fact, hold an Oscar and has been nominated on numerous occasions.  What's more, unlike Jim Carrey (who might have a shot at the `serious' tip), Williams started with a dramatic role in only his second feature film!  That would be `The World According to Garp;' and along with such noble (if not pretty darn cool) efforts such as, `Dead Poet's Society,' `Awakenings,' `The Fisher King,' `Good Will Hunting,' and `What Dreams May Come,' we can see that he has risen to the occasion (sometimes in grand style) and he is not so much of a hack.  Which brings me to back to `One Hour Photo'&#133;There was nothing wrong with this movie; nothing wrong with Robin Williams' performance (he was convincing, well suited for the role, and showed nice acting nuances).  The movie had an interesting plot, it was well paced; it had a nice color palate, and it had a few subtle plot strokes.  However, I only feel compelled to give it a 7.6/10, overall.  I don't know why.  Maybe the movie was just too NICE.  But, I did enjoy it!  I will even venture to say that if Robin Williams had not played the lead, then the movie might not have been anything.Anyway, a `7.6' is not too shabby in my book.  If I saw it for 10 bucks, used, I would purchase it for my collection.

I am a fan of actors turning themselves into versatile performers, as you get to see them in many different ways. That is what Robin Williams is doing with his career right now and a smart move if you ask me. &#145;One Hour Photo' will make you think long and hard about the people that serve behind a shop counter, especially at your local photo developer.In &#145;One Hour Photo', Seymour Sy Parrish is a quiet, consummately professional photo lab technician employed in a huge, impersonal shopping centre. One customer, Nina Yorkin is unaware that Sy has been carefully printing off extra sets of her family snapshots for years, adding them to a photo collage he has assembled in his apartment. Just how far will the lonely Sy go to become part of Nina's seemingly perfect American family unit? This film was written and directed by Mark Romanek. The start of the movie was cleverly incorporated, setting everything up beautifully. I also love the great tension that Mark included in the film, through Sy's character throughout the movie, especially at the end of the film. I am sure that Seymour would be a character that Romanek will be keeping near and dear to him, as he is a brilliantly designed character, one that the movie going public will not forget too quickly. There are other things the Romanek did well in this film as well. I loved Sy's &#145;Photo wall' which was a clever idea by Mark. The scene that shows Parrish imaging being part of the Yorkin family was also well written by Romanek. This was Mark's first feature film, not a bad effort, considering before this he was doing music videos, a very big and successful change from where I see it.Robin Williams is an actor who has had a very successful, but somewhat predictable career. He has been in many films, as the same sort of goodie character all the time. So, it was with great anticipation that I was able to see Williams in one of his strongest, unsentimental performances, a role that gives him a completely different complexion. As he was in &#145;Insomnia', Williams is cast against type in &#145;One Hour Photo', again being the bad guy. He suits the bad guy genre and I hope he continues in this realm.Seymour Parrish is a truly disturbing character. He has no friends or family, and we know very little about him, only that he works at the local sav-mart, in the photo processing department and that he seems psychologically unstable. Sy can process your photos quickly and tell what size best suits the picture you have taken, (he says many times that photos done in 5x7 could be better choice than 6x4 etc). We also see him having many hard times, none more so, than what the boss of &#145;Sav-mart', Bill Owens (Gary Cole) says and does to him, which is just gut wrenching. He makes all of Sy's problems even worse.   There are other important characters in the film. The Yorkin Family, Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan) and Jake (Dylan Smith) are a family that Parrish knows a lot about. This is another creepy side to his character, as he has memorised the Yorkin family's address and every other minor detail, which is truly scary. Then when Sy has the chance to uncover a big secret in the Yorkin familles seamlessly perfect life, he takes advantage of his job, by using photos brought in by one of Sy's many customers, that being Maya Burson (Erin Daniels), to do so. Then the way Parrish meddles in this predicament was a truly enthralling moment of the movie for me. Throughout the movie, we see Parrish being both investigated and integrated by Detective Van Der Zee (former ER star Eriq LaSalle), who finds Sy to be a big problem, who is difficult to handle.     But enough about the plot, I will leave some of it for you to learn, so you can enjoy the richness of the movie experience. I must say I appreciated the work of cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth. I especially love the &#145;savmart' locations on the film and the different camera angles that Cronenweth shows us in that place, as I feel they jump out at you. There is also a very tainted look to different parts of the film, again Cronenweth's influence, which is understandable, considering we are dealing with photography and a sick man in the film. Robin Williams also looks quite nasty in this film, and he was helped to look this way by the make-up department, headed by Suzanne Rodier, who did a great job in making Williams look as menacing as he could be.   I really like this movie, in particular Robin William's gripping performance that is in it. &#145;One Hour Photo' has been compared to the brilliant &#145;American Beauty', which is a big rap, and I can see where people are forming that opinion from. I have a friend who works at one of my town's local photo shops and I have recommended that he watches this film, as I am sure he could relate to the character of Seymour and what he goes through in vocational sense at the photo shop. I just hope he is not like him, which I am sure he is not. This film will make us appreciate how memorable photos can be for us all, and that obsessed people can be extremely disturbing for the community that we live in. I am certain they are much closer than we all think. Perhaps you might be served by someone like that someday? My advice to you is, keep on the look out for them!
