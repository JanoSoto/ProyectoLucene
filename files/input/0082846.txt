[{"Title":"Veteran actors prove they can still hack it on Golden Pond.","Date":"22 July 2000","Score":"72 out of 78 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"   Mark Rydell's On Golden Pond was a surprise hit in 1981, finishing third in box office grosses after Rocky III and E.T. Such an occurrence was unheard of in Hollywood, considering the key players in the film, Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn,  each had not had a hit film in almost twenty years and were both hardly spring chickens in the business. Both these veteran actors proved they could still make it in Hollywood among young starlets, and triumph. Still, when you see On Golden Pond, you sense that their teaming together for the first time in their careers is purely a special occasion, an opportunity of a lifetime that few actors in their seventies receive. They in turn have left us with a wonderful showcase of movie talent, a film of warmth, good humor, and love. It always amazes me when I read that Henry Fonda had only received two Oscar nominations during his career, one of which he earned for this film. Like his good friend Jimmy Stewart, Fonda was rarely a boisterous actor. He had a natural ease to his acting, a gift for making audiences believe that every word he uttered was truth. Now, in his final screen performance as Norman Thayer Jr., Fonda had to reach deep into his own personal experience and his advancing years to create a character who struggles with his own mortality. Norman is a grouchy curmudgeon who has memory lapses and heart palpitations. He has a loving and cheerful wife, Ethel (Hepburn), but a difficult relationship with his only daughter, Chelsea (Jane Fonda). He and Ethel journey back to their cottage on the lake for what may be their last summer. Immediately, Norman comes face to face with his old age and his inability to remember what should be familiar sights. I especially like the scene where he gets lost in the woods looking for strawberries and scares himself when he is unable to find his way back. Ethel has such faith in him, sure he will get back on that horse and be as valiant as he once was. What more could you want from a wife? Chelsea arrives after many years away from her parents, bringing with her a new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his son, Billy (Doug McKeon). You can sense the tension between Chelsea and Norman the minute she walks in the door. This reunion is fascinating not only because we can never tell where the difficulty lies in their relationship, but also the fact that these problems also exist on and off the screen. The father-daughter relationship between Henry and Jane was also very turbulent ever since Jane began her protests in Vietnam, much to the chagrin of her father. This collaboration of the two was meant to mend fences between them. Not often do the personal lives of actors collide so eloquently in Hollywood, but here it seems just about right. The sequence where Norman and Bill (Coleman) attempt to build a conversation is originally conceived and acted so naturally. He carefully asks Norman if it would be alright if Chelsea and he sleep together in the same room at the cottage. Of course, Norman makes this confrontation as difficult as possible, making Bill nervous and jerking him around. Ironically, Bill comes back at him, not allowing Norman to use him in petty mindgames and hoping they would become friends, which is obviously not an easy task. This is an unsettling turn for Norman and the audience, but it is necessary for the story to progress and for Norman to respond accordingly to the other characters in the story. Ethel and Norman volunteer to let Billy stay with them for the summer while Chelsea and Bill head off to Europe. Billy is not pleased with the arrangement at the outset, but gradually bonds with Norman through learning to fish on the pond. While Billy is not necessarily an original character, it is fascinating to see him try to understand Norman, and in turn how Norman learns to associate with the son he never had. It is a learning experience for both of them, even though they are many generations apart. Many reviewers have remarked that ON GOLDEN POND uses a conventional story and revives it with great performances from the cast. It is interesting to note that the screenwriter, Ernest Thompson, altered his own play in order to escape a bit of the conventionality that the film medium required. The framework may seem as original as an old shoe, but the added touches in the script and its delivery give this film a certain magic that only classical Hollywood films possessed. Fonda has a great way to end a career with this role, placing himself completely within Norman's world and searching within and through the role for his own solutions to life's problems. His Oscar was given to him for more reasons than mere charity. Hepburn is delightful as Ethel, working so well with Fonda that it does not seem as if they are acting. For a couple of old Hollywood actors who never even met before this, they each prove they are true masters of their craft. Jane Fonda takes a supporting role this time, incorporating some of the same motives as her father into her part, and as a result delivers a special performance. Mark Rydell is one of those directors that often gets left off the list of the all-time greats, but proves once again here he is a masterful storyteller. In this project, he allows both the visual elements of the pond and his actors to make magic, a truly memorable combination.  On Golden Pond is not an epic, but what it accomplishes runs close to epic proportions. It is very rare that a stageplay converts so well to the screen like this one. On Golden Pond is vibrant, emotional, and so heartfelt, it is impossible not to like, unless you are a curmudgeon like Norman Thayer. It is also unique that great actors such as these will agree to try again for Hollywood glory so late in their careers. It is up to us viewers to experience this wonder before the chance is lost and these thespians finally close up the cottage and head off to their retirement.    "},{"Title":"Warm, reflective, touchingly basic human drama, with Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn offering treasured performances in their twilight years.","Date":"19 March 2002","Score":"46 out of 50 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":"  On Golden Pond is simply an old-fashioned testimonial to long-lost youth and facing one's mortality, and, in its simplicity, becomes a life-affirming valentine to those who feel that time has become the enemy - a seemingly ageless, universal perception.  If not for the magnificent acting duet between Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, this lovely, sentient piece would have been ignored by most moviegoers.  But buoyed by these two acting legends, it manages to circumnavigate the heavy, mawkish waters -- rising far above and beyond anybody's expectation.  Earning a whopping ten Oscar nominations, Ernest Thompson's reflective screenplay won one of those Oscars, but, for me, it's Dave Grusin's soothing, glistening score that is the stronger selling point here, adding immeasurably to the film's ruminative tone and gently rustic surroundings.Henry Fonda plays brusque, cantankerous Norman Thayer, a one-time college professor approaching his 80th birthday with a mixture of anger, cynicism and fear as he shows signs of losing his faculties.  Norman is not a particularly kind or considerate gent.  Abrupt, callous, remote, and ill-equipped to offer nurturing support of any kind, living with Norman must have been quite an ordeal for those growing up under his roof.  As a means of self-preservation, their only child, Chelsea, has long estranged herself from the family, unable to emotionally come to terms with her unhappy, unhealthy relationship with her father.Fonda offers the most affecting, endearing performance of his durable career.  He manages to use Norman's undesirable traits to his advantage, investing in his character a gruff charm and cynical sense of humor that is totally winning.  He melts away the harmful, negative elements, as Carroll O'Connor managed to do for Archie Bunker, and makes Norman not only funny and entertaining, but loveable.  As a result, Fonda becomes the glowing centerpiece of `On Golden Pond,' and it is this portrayal, along with his `Grapes of Wrath' Tom Joad, that will remain indelibly etched in our hearts and minds for decades to come.Kate Hepburn is his Ethel, a loving, pragmatic anchor who obviously has played an important role in the lifetime success of this complicated man. Devoted to a tee, Ethel understands and compensates for the weaknesses of her husband.  She valiantly assuages his deepening fears with good-natured kidding, feigned hopelessness, and careful but subtle guidance.  She is Dulcinea to his Don Quixote.  As a lioness would shield an endangered cub, she has automatically assumed the roles of caregiver, protectorate and confidence booster without pause or grief.  Only for Ethel does Norman step out of his shield of emotional armor and display a genuine affection that is lost to others, including himself.  Hepburn absolutely radiates with warmth and vitality, providing the film with a necessary center.  Though less flashy and substantive, both she and Fonda were Oscared for their work here, with Hepburn winning a record-breaking fourth 'Best Actress' award. Incidentally, this was their ONLY screen pairing, yet they work together as if they've known each other all their lives.Fifteen-year-old Doug McKeon manages to hold his own among the star power here as a young resentful upstart whose dentist father (Dabney Coleman) is romantically involved with Chelsea.  Forced to play out the rest of his summer with the old folks while his father and girlfriend spend quality time together, he learns a delicate lesson or two as he develops an unlikely bond with Norman.  Coleman himself has one edgy, amusing scene as he tries to gracefully deal with an overly wry Norman.Surprisingly, the weakest story link involves Norman's strained relationship with daughter Chelsea, played by Hank's own daughter, Jane Fonda (Oscar-nominated).  The familial situation obviously parallels their own real-life lack of connection, but the scenes seem strangely shallow and self-serving as they forge through some mucky emotional moments as if striving for real-life closure.  What should have been insightful and compelling comes off forced and distracting, particularly on Jane's part.Henry Fonda's own physical frailty at the time of shooting adds a special poignancy to the film.  Ironically, Hepburn won her second Oscar in 1967 for playing another wifely Rock of Gibraltar in `Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' The ailing Spencer Tracy died shortly after the completion of that film. Fonda would pass away a few months after winning his only Oscar.A most welcome and satisfying diversion that touches with its unpretentiousness, `On Golden Pond' is a lovely, lovely little film that should resonate for ages to come.

I have always had the opinion that most acting from the 60's and earlier is one dimensional and flat.  But then I saw this film and I realized that I was watching two of the best, from any era.  Fonda and Hepburn are absolutely stunning in here and they so richly deserved to win their Oscars that year.  And not only am I mad to see that Chariots of Fire beat out Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it also beat this film out as best picture, and that is a shame, and a crime.On Golden Pond reminded me a little of my relationship with my grandfather.  It's not that we didn't get along because we did, but at times it was a little strained simply because of the age difference.  But Billy soon learns that Norman Thayer Jr. is not just an old man, but he is a guy that has a lot say and he can offer him so much and of course they become friends.  So we all know how the movie is going to end up, but it is the execution that is the strength of the film.  We watch as these two grow together.  We sense that they are becoming more at ease with each other and when we finally see our two guys catch that guarantuan fish named Walter, by this time we are pretty much sure what they are going to do.  And it's kind of funny to draw parallels between Walter the fish, and Norman the crusty old man.  But both have been around the pond for years.  Norman's life wouldn't be the same if his quest for the fish was never there.  Perhaps the same with Walter, perhaps he has enjoyed alluding Norman for all these years.  But now the game is up, but it doesn't have to be.  Norman caught him, perhaps that's all that should matter.  You can draw your own conclusions from that analogy.  But I like the way it comes out.On Golden Pond is a treasure.  It is sweet, tender and honest.  You will never see a performance better than the one Henry Fonda gives in this one.  And this made me want to go out and rent some of the films that the two screen legends were in before and I have to admit that their early work is impressive.  But it is here that they shine like never before.  So my recommendation is this.  If you are young and would never imagine seeing a film like this because it doesn't have someone like Sara Michelle Gellar or Arnold Schwartzenegger in it, then take the take advice of someone who had the same pre-conceived notions when I was 15.  No Sly, no Spielberg?  Hey forget it, not my cup of tea.  But this will give you a new appreciation of film.  It really is that good.And for those of you that have seen it, remember this line? Wife's name is Ethel Thayer, thounds like I'm lithsping dothsn't it?   What a great film.

To come out of retirement and do something like that is unbelievable. I can only assume that their performances are so similar to what they are in real life that it wasn't really acting.If you are at all a fan of Fonda or Hepburn, you must see this film.

When I watched it, I really enjoyed it!  It makes you not want to take life for granted, in any way.  For Norman, he learns not to take life for granted by enjoying it.  He also learns not to be so crotchety, and not to dote on death.  His daughter, Chelsea, learned to forget about her differences with her father, and to love him while she can.  Katharine Hepburn also gives a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance as Ethel Thayer, Norman's devoted wife.  She helps him in more ways than the audience realizes, because she tries to make him feel young, which is what he needs. On Golden Pond is a wonderful movie with a combination of drama and comedy that makes for an entertaining experience.  I recommend this movie to everyone!

This film brought to light two important realizations for me.Family togetherness is one of the most important things we have in life,and we had better resolve our differences as a family and get along because we can't go back and correct the things we come to regret.Secondly,I came to realize that elderly couples are more than the stereotype we sometimes force upon them.They don't cease to be affectionate and sexual merely because they have gotten older.Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn made a delightful couple here and make you wish they had worked together more often through the years,but unfortunately,this was their first and only film together.Also,the pairing of Fonda with real life daughter Jane was indeed a delight to see.Their own troubled relationship made them naturals for their parts as a father and daughter coming together after years of tension.You could sense that at times, Henry and Jane were not acting at all when it came to their scenes with one another,making these scenes more realistic and effective.Henry Fonda received a well deserved Oscar for this film.I watched the night he received it,and recall his reaction from his home(he was too ill to attend the ceremony),and the tears streaming down his face.I couldn't help but shed a tear or two myself.I'm sure I was not the only one.Great film.

The enveloping surrounds of the woods, the shimmering gold of the pond at dark, the loons, the details of the water plants. Rarely I have seen such a eye captivating piece of film. And set to the gentle, breezy thought provoking music makes it nothing short of perfect.  Reduced to a single plot line, this movie would sound rather silly. It is one of those films in which the lead actors already supercede the brilliance of the writing. This of course could be expected from two of Hollywood's best loved veterans. There were things in the movie I could see coming due to experience, but the amount of plot turns was amazing. There was also enough direction, good in the sense the director achieved getting what he wanted, but without interfering too much with the performances.Henry Fonda, in his final performance as the cranky, lovable Norman, made me sit up and take notice in his only Oscar deserved role. I had seen him previously in earlier films like The Grapes of Wrath and 12 Angry Men, but I disliked both of them. His pivotal performance in the interaction of the 13 year old Billy was incredibly funny, moving and something that many people could relate to because of the generation gap. The film truly captured the spirit of Katharine Hepburn, not very much unlike the loving, cheerful Ethel herself. At least twice in her legendary career she was passed over for two Oscars she deserved, for The Philadelphia Story and The African Queen. It was great of the Academy to hand Kate her last well deserved award.  The other support actors managed to do a pretty great job. The exception was Jane Fonda for her performance as Chelsea. It may or may not have been her fault, but her acting was pretty weak, regardless of the script. Underneath it all, there are messages. Things that we could help mend but with our continued prejudiced beliefs never happen. The example of this was the tense relationship of Norman and Chelsea, a problem staring them in the face but could have been solved if only there were a little faith. In real life, we don't have to look much further than our front door to find these things. On Golden Pond has taken its place as one of my favourite movies. The nominations and Oscars it received that year was well deserved. I love the movie mostly through the fact that violence and special effects are not needed to drive it, too typical of movies right now. It was made at a time when these things were too sadly emerging, so it was really a breath of fresh air amongst sameness. The movie was wholesome indeed, but it had something else. It was compelling drama, and real to life honesty and humanity are all that is needed to make it a movie great. And its all these elements for which it should be credited.

The theme of everlasting love, knowing eachothers habits through a whole life is really something very very special. The roles as the elderly couple were also played with such an honesty that it was amazing and the music plus the landscape and the actual calmness of the film makes it into a film that won't ever be forgotten; at least it shouldn't be!Of course it's romantic but it's also realistic and that's what makes it different from other socalled romantic films.

Of course the cinematography is magnificent, with lovely country scenery and beautiful lakeside vistas, all well incorporated into the emotional aspects of the picture.The movie brings the viewer into what is probably the last of many summers spent at their Golden Pond cottage by retired professor, Norman Thayer, an ornery old codger, and his cheerful, loving wife, Ethel. Their semi estranged 40 something daughter, Chelsea (Jane Fonda), comes to visit, in honor of her father's 80th birthday, bringing her new fiancé, Bill. The younger couple leave Bill's young teenage son, Billy, with Chelsea's parents while they jaunt off to Europe for a couple of weeks on holiday.It's a film that is character driven, and all about relationships. For me, the most moving is that between husband and wife. Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn give brilliant Oscar winning performances as the aging Thayer couple, Norman and Ethel. Their relationship, the love, support, and comfortable banter, is so amazing on screen it is impossible to believe they aren't actually married in real life. Norman has become quite frail and has troubling health concerns, both physical (heart palpitations) and mental (some memory loss). Mind you, this film is all a bit depressing with Norman's anxieties about his mortality (no comforting faith mentioned here, unfortunately) and of course his aging. Ethel is jovially comforting, especially when he gets a little lost in the woods while they are out picking strawberries together. This scene is beautifully done by both spouses. He's a sympathetic but crotchety character to say the least, yet she always manages to deal with him affectionately.Also, the relationship between Norman and the fiancé's young son... Although Billy has earlier been rather miffed at being stuck with these old folks for the summer, Norman develops quite a touching grandfatherly relationship with him, as the two go fishing together and so forth. The only relationship that doesn't come off well here is the strained father / daughter one between Norman and Chelsea that presumably is meant to reflect the real life tensions between Henry and Jane Fonda. Frankly, Chelsea seems more like a self absorbed teenager or 20 something, trying to find herself. By age 40, she should have done so and become a genuine support to these elderly parents of hers. I really like Jane Fonda in some of her roles, but this particular character hasn't much depth and is little asset to the movie. Hopefully, at least making On Golden Pond together helped to mend any real life fences between the two Fondas.In any case, the film examines skillfully the aging process from the very personal perspective of a loving couple going through it, and as such is a movie not to be missed.

Jane Fonda and her father did not get along. Jane, however wanted one last chance for a close bond to her father and bought the rights to the play On Golden Pond.

Your spirits soar and any relationship that can be amended and is anywhere near as strong in the film (From Hepburn and Fonda) shows us what acting can do.Oscars abound, critical praise and very likely the last of the old fashioned melodramas (Mainly because acting has moved on a generation from these sorts of films.)

I remember watching the Oscars for the year On Golden Pond was nominated and being ecstatic when they both won. It would have been nice if the movie had won also but oh well. I noticed that there are pearls of wisdom for everyone in this movie. For me, it was when Ethel tells Chelsea that life marches on, no matter what we are sad or bitter about.

It was really quite the local event. On Golden Pond not only showcases the stunning scenery of that region, but Henry Fonda & Kate Hepburn's dynamic performances truly capture the New England spirit.

Newfound-where Henry fell into the water while fishing, among other shots, and Winnipesaukeee, for most of the aerial shots, and the mail boat. While they did combine the lakes into the fictitious `Golden Pond', what you see on the screen is what those places look like. No post-production trickery here.There haven't been a ton of New England movies made. Good Will Hunting and Perfect Storm got a lot of attention, but On Golden Pond, in addition to being one of the finest character studies in film history, perfectly captures New England beautiful, contemplative, with an understanding that newer isn't necessarily better, and that still waters truly run deep.

Yet it is not the sort of film for which one would normally predict great box-office success. It is about as different a film from Raiders as one can imagine. Whereas Spielberg's blockbuster is a testosterone-fuelled action-adventure, On Golden Pond is a quiet, reflective drama about an elderly couple spending the summer by a lake.The film was adapted by Ernest Thompson from his play of the same name. (Remarkably, given his theme of old age, Thompson was still in his twenties when he wrote it). Although attempts are made to open the action up by including scenes shot outdoors (there is some very attractive photography of the New England scenery), it clearly betrays its origin as a stage play with its limited number of characters and preponderance of dialogue over physical action.The central characters are Norman (aged eighty) and Ethel (aged in her late sixties) Thayer, who spend every summer at their second home on Golden Pond, a lake in New Hampshire. (The word pond in American usage can clearly mean a far larger body of water than it does in Britain). The plot focuses on the relationship between Norman and Ethel and their daughter Chelsea, who pays them a visit together with her fiancé Bill and his twelve-year-old son Billy. (Were women of Jane Fonda's generation ever named Chelsea? I though that only began to be used as a girl's name in the sixties).Jane Fonda purchased the rights to the play as a vehicle for her father Henry, doubtless because she saw in the turbulent relationship between Norman and Chelsea Thayer a reflection of the equally difficult real-life relationship between the Fondas. Norman is in many ways the most important character in the film. It is clear that he has always been a difficult man to get on with, and age does not seem to have mellowed the cantankerous old man at all. He bickers constantly with his long-suffering and more placid wife Ethel, although it is clear that despite their verbal battles they have a deep affection for one another. You old poop! might not normally be regarded as a term of endearment; as used by Ethel about her husband it becomes one.The father-daughter relationship between Norman and Chelsea is clearly more problematic, although the roots of their estrangement are never made clear. Possibly Norman resents his daughter for not being the son he longed for but never had, and he make his dislike of her new fiancé all too obvious. What serves to bring father and daughter back together is the special bond which grows up between Norman and young Billy, whom he and Ethel look after while Chelsea and Bill are away on vacation in Europe. Norman might not have a son, but Billy, although not related to him by blood, is the grandson he always wanted so they can go on fishing trips together. (Chelsea's first marriage, which ended in divorce, was childless).The film stars not only Henry Fonda as Norman but also another great cinema legend, Katharine Hepburn, as Ethel, and both won well-deserved Oscars for their performances. Fonda's award seems to have come as something of a surprise; in the course of his long career he had received only one previous acting nomination, for The Grapes of Wrath in 1940, and the year before making On Golden Pond had been given an Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement. (Such awards are often interpreted as meaning we're sorry that you've never had a real Oscar and are never likely to get one, so please accept this consolation prize with our apologies). This was to be Fonda's last film; he was to die a few months after receiving his award. In Hepburn's case this was her fourth Best Actress award, setting a record which still stands. Jane Fonda was nominated for Best Supporting Actress but missed out, possibly because she already had two Oscars on her mantelpiece and the Academy thought it would only be fair to spread the honours more evenly.On Golden Pond can, at times, be rather sugary, but for the most part it is lifted above mere sentimentality by the strength of the acting. During the seventies the cinema had become increasingly youth-obsessed, a trend which was to continue throughout the eighties (and, indeed, is still continuing today). It therefore comes as a refreshing surprise to come across a film from this period which stars in its leading roles two actors in their seventies. Like Ordinary People, which won Best Picture the previous year, this film is a drama which explores, in a sensitive and sympathetic manner, the difficulties faced by ordinary human beings doing their best to cope with life. 7/10 "},{"Title":"Reflections on a golden time.","Date":"30 July 2006","Score":"4 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" The title makes it sound twee, but On Golden Pond slowly uncovers its rewards the deeper we get into the story.

I would venture those who thought this film was mushy and silly are very young people, and most probably should study it to see how they will be - they hope ! - in their own elder-years. I'm there already, but feel just like Hepburn acts, ageless.....This WAS the most endearing role of Fonda's career - he was an opinionated man in real-life and chose his roles well, to fit his ideals. Perhaps Tenticles was just to pay the rent. Can't understand how some people didn't enjoy his role in The Grapes of Wrath - gripping tale which didn't call for over-the-top acting. This movie was a little cleaned-up for how the depression really was. On Golden Pond reflected the simplicity of his off-screen life - he could be seen almost daily tilling a big vegetable garden next to his home in Beverly Hills, yet. It wasn't one of the snobbish houses - just nice. A bit of trivia some of Hollywoods biggest stars did not live in mansions - Lucille Ball, for instance - not far away from Fonda.I truly am stumped that ANYONE could denigrate Hepburn's career. One user painted her as a hard woman - smart would be better. She could have married Howard Hughes, but knew his life was full of baggage. Her career withstood without scandal the open secret that she was madly in love with Spencer Tracy, who was hard to love. That she won four Oscars should demonstrate she knew which roles to choose and how to bring them to life, not just deliver them. WE ALL could take lessons from her on how to be true to yourself, but also be principled.Jane Fonda was much like her dad, in that she was opinionated and fearless in expressing her opinions. Too much already about all that War stuff !! - take a very good look at They Shoot Horses, Don't They and you'll see this lady is a skillful actress. Maybe it and Klute are too old for today's users ? Doug McKeon gets billing over Dabney Coleman? Hmmmmmm......how did THAT happen ? I don't recall seeing McKeon in one other film - made more? I was in a Mark Rydell film and can attest - as most people recognized - his directing was brilliant, because he did exactly as folk said get the best and let them do their roles. If Ernest Thompson won an Oscar for his screen-adaptation from his Broadway-hit, then that attests he knew his theme and made it better.What a magical cast!, combined with a beautiful score and clear-cut cinematography. Hepburn and Fonda had acting-experience under their belts, and also knew what aging entailed. As one user wrote, younger people should get to know their grandparents better. Fonda's candor and delivery were a perfect match for Hepburn's supportive love - brilliant acting! I found Jane's edginess for her role to be a natural - Billy was the perfect example that her dad wanted a boy, perhaps as rebellious as Billy was.All of this put together into a tale of lives grown goldenly ripe is fail-proof, no matter what film it was up-against. True, there won't be too many more movies from Hollywood like this film, because there aren't any actors/actresses left to do them - maybe Streep. Pitt and Jolie ? PLEASE ! I completely overlooked the shadow of the 'copter showing the scene goofs pointed-out - unimportant. There weren't any other goofs. Indeed, this film will live for ever, because it preserves on media which can let us watch it over-and-over again - which I do. Everyone should - simplicity, except for those who need all the action in today's films, is the best - tell me like it is. 20-out-of-10.....

The cast is excellent. Believe it or not! Jane Fonda fought to get this produced because she knew her father was dying and the studios didn't want to take a chance on Henry Fonda. There are several great moments in the film. Sometimes the film is heartbreaking like when Norman talks back to the teens on the dock. I love the way that Fonda and Hepburn really act and appear like an old couple. I thought they were together in real life. You can't imagine a finer couple on screen.

Did Rydell make the movie too mawkish, yes? Is Jane Fonda showing off for her work out tapes here, yes? Why does a sour, misanthropic philosopher adore this movie? Because it shows a couple going through the hardest part of life dying. It explains to younger people why older people are so grumpy or angry they are afraid, death is near. The love between the two, Ethel and Norman, has such a moving power to it. The depiction of his losing his faculties, take it from someone who cared for dementia relatives for twenty years this is quite well done. It does terrify them; she hangs on to Norman giving him the strength he needs to keep fighting. When he gets lost, looking for strawberries, Fonda does such a great job with this scene. My favorite scene is where Hepburn tells him that he will get back up on that horse and together they will go go go. The movie models not only Norman's battle with imminent death and his terror of it, but also the hidden story, to be a caregiver of the dying. She is such a fortress of strength to him; he draws so much solace and comfort within her loving arms. It has such a line I use, when people get on my nerves,He is trying, just like you, to find his way, the movie deserved every award that it won. The hardest thing for the old and dying is what you hear Billy Jr. say,He creeps me out, what if he dies? The ones I cared for, all their friends and family flee from them. They carry death now, and no one but no one wants to be near death. Rydell puts plenty of humor in this sad film. Do not run away from it, it is not the depressing Going In Style from the 70s. The movie has great warmth, love and deals with a subject most repressed within our hedonistic culture death. It shows you, within its cute little story, how to care for a dying loved one. Ethel is patient with his fury towards everyone and everything about him, even the mail man. Fonda will surprise you with his comic ability. A dentist huh, want to see my teeth? Rydell works hard to put lots of great funny dialog mainly from grumpy old Norman's mouth. There is wonderful symbolism with the loons. The two together like Ethel and Norman. Later, when Billy catches a dead one; look at the horror on Norman's face. The compassion for the unwanted Billy with Norman getting to be with Chelsea again, vicariously, through Billy, is also a beautiful touch. This is what Ethel tries to explain, futilely, to Chelsea, underneath all that fear is a very good, loving man. She just cannot see him through the covering of terror of approaching death. Yes, it is sentimental, but as someone who took care of three people, all dead now, I can tell you it depicts this part of life very well. Two of the three had dementias and Norman's terror at his fading mind is not maudlin. I love the movie, despite all its flaws, because it models the hardest of all the duties of love hanging on when you will want to flee. Ethel stays with Norman, this is the depth of her love for him. The flight of everyone from them is the hardest for them to bear, nobody calls or visits anymore. Ethel is all he has, Norman clings to her and she makes the path much less dark.

Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda, both late in their careers, are unbelievably perfect as an old couple all too familiar with each other and still beautifully in love. They are funny, tender, delicate, sassy, and idiosyncratic to a tee. Great great stuff.When daughter Jane (Fonda) arrives, playing their daughter, with her faux-husband (Dabney Coleman), the plot gets complicated in clumsy ways, predictable ones, with a step son to mix it up. The middle third of the film is therefore almost dispensable, except to see what happens, but it's straight ahead drama without nuance. There is that pretty but somewhat annoying music David Grusin was used for so often in these years, and there is the routine construction and editing throughout. Director Mark Rydell is understandably little known (he did other routine stuff for movies and television, but nothing with these credentials again).But hang in there. By the end, we have out two stars again, and boy, you know them from years of movies, you feel like you know them now. They have different names, but there they are, Henry and Kate, and it made my cry shamelessly. As a movie lover, I guess, but also as someone who loves sincere drama well done.So how to judge this as a movie? I almost say don't. Judge it as a vehicle for seeing these two truly legendary and remarkable people, actors and humans both, almost as themselves, pouring it on and letting it all out.

The actor has spanned all the way from the first Academy Award-nominated performance in The Grapes of Wrath, to producing the classic 12 Angry Men, to playing one of the coldest villains of all time in Once Upon a Time in the West, in comedies such as The Cheyenne Social Club and Mister Roberts, and now to his final years, where he gives his only Academy Award-winning performance alongside the legendary actress Katharine Hepburn and Fonda's daughter Jane in On Golden Pond. This is a film which is probably the kind to be ignored by a lot of people, because from the outside, what in it looks all that appealing? The film is, yes, about an old couple and their troubled relationship with their daughter. This is a film about human bonding and troubles between family members, especially when time is running out. But what people have to realize is that even a film like this can be a masterpiece. On Golden Pond is really one of the best films there is out there. I admit what really got me to watch it was Henry Fonda. But now I can appreciate it more than just for the fact that it has one of my all-time favorite actors in it.On Golden Pond is a movie that can even make me, a member of the younger generation, think about how I am going to deal with my life in the future, especially when my years are coming to a close. This film symbolizes not only the drama of a troubled family, but also the horrors of coming to the end of your life. When you are at a time where you can't control yourself and things that were so easy in the past are now difficult to control and manipulate. And in the back of your mind, you are having this fear that any one of these days, your life could just end. And then it's over. A particular question asked by one of the characters really got me thinking. Doug McKeon asks Henry Fonda's character Are you afraid of dying?. And that really made me wonder what people who are reaching that point of their lives really think about death. When you're young, death is nothing to worry about. You figure that if you'll die, it'll be in some horrible accident. But what about when you're eighty years old and everything is falling apart? Death could be around the corner. Your heart can simply just stop on you and you won't even realize it. I now wonder how I would feel at that age. Knowing that any day I could die without any significance.Performances by all of the cast members are excellent. Both Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda won the Academy Award for their acting in this film. For Hepburn, it was her record-holding win of four. And unfortunately, for an actor such as Henry Fonda, it was his only win. And this was his last film, so he never got a chance to do it again. Jane Fonda got a nomination for her performance in the film and when I look at her and her father in this movie and how the plot develops to make us become attached to them and realize the drama of their family problems, I often times wonder if this was the real case with the Fondas. Did these two famous Oscar-winners ever really get a chance to know each other well and be friends? Was On Golden Pond really not them just acting, but telling their own kind of life story? Only Jane Fonda could answer that question now, but I like to think that maybe they did have a troubled relationship and that On Golden Pond at least allowed them to make peace and love each other for Henry Fonda's last days. I know I could rest in peace with that.Bottom line, this is one of the greatest movies of all time. It's not a big action picture, it's not thrilling or suspenseful or anything like that that really attracts the younger generation. But I have had the opportunity to see this is and I really appreciate this movie for its symbols. Not only that, it is just a very compelling story, well-directed, beautifully acted, and is just a very entertaining film.

Whether the characters in the movie remind them of themselves, their parents, or their children, there is someone in that movie one can always recognize. There's a tremendous warmth in every scene, radiating a sense of love, confusion, and of old wounds that are (almost) too deep to heal. I always find it hard to believe that neither Fonda had ever met Hepburn, as it seems that they've known each other their whole lives.At the beginning, Norman and Ethel Thayer (Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn) arrive at their cabin in Maine for their fiftieth, and possibly last, summer together. Norman is nearly eighty and beginning to become senile. Ethel, about eleven years his junior, can only watch as her husband slowly fades.It soon becomes clear that Norman is obsessed with death and dying. Sent out to pick strawberries in the woods, he loses his way and comes running back to Ethel, who tries to console him with the now-famous line You're my knight in shining armour, and you're going to get right back on that horse and I'll be right behind you, and away we're going to go, go, go. That scene shows exactly what the relationship between Norman and Ethel is supposed to be like They love each other deeply, though they're not without faults, and stick together throughout good and bad. It sounds cliché, but it's rare to find this so well-written in a Hollywood film.Their daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) joins them to celebrate Norman's birthday, bringing her new boyfriend Bill (Dabney Coleman) and his son Billy (Doug McKeon). Chelsea has always had a difficult relationship with Norman (I didn't think we were mad...I thought we just didn't like each other), due to his sorrow over never having a son and her inability to communicate.Ernest Thompson's screenplay fully deserved the Oscar that year. The family he writes about are realistic, just as flawed as any real people. He plays with running gags effectively- for example, a joke involving the screen door, or various phrases such as San-frantastic! and suck face that Norman and Billy pick up from each other.Director Mark Rydell proves to be an excellent storyteller, and good at drawing powerful performances from his actors. The cinematography by Billy Williams and score by Dave Grusin are absolutely gorgeous.All the actors have nice chemistry together that is just right for the film, making you laugh one minute and cry the next. Particularly good are Hepburn and Henry Fonda. The Fondas had a rocky relationship in reality, and in their only film together they reconciled offscreen as well- Henry Fonda died about a year later. On Golden Pond was his last film role, and Jane Fonda would always say that she was grateful she could make that movie with her father.Henry Fonda's performance is absolutely brilliant- funny, touching, and dead-on. As an old man afraid and accepting of death at the same time, he pulls it off beautifully. Notable scene Norman loses his way only a few minutes away from home, then returns only to bully the hapless mailman, Charlie (played very well by William Lanteau) in frustration.My favourite (of course) is Katharine Hepburn's portrayal of the strong, loving Ethel Thayer. At seventy-four, Hepburn shows that she is still her spunky self, putting her fascinating personality into the performance as usual. She portrayed a similar character in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, wonderfully I hasten to add, but Ethel Thayer seems to have much more charm and heart. This was Hepburn's last great role (forget that awful Love Affair), and she seems to know it. She really makes this one count. Notable scene Norman suffers angina at the very end of the summer. Ethel tries frantically to call the hospital, but to no avail. She asks him if he's going to die on her. He tells her that it doesn't hurt anymore, and she tearfully recounts her feelings as she realized that Norman would actually die someday.Jane Fonda's portrayal is my least favourite. Perhaps it's because Chelsea isn't a very sympathetic character, or maybe it's perhaps I just plain dislike Jane Fonda (though I admire her politics).

Norman gives him an earful, and Bill returns the favour.Many people have said this movie is a depressing story about death. I found it was the opposite a life-affirming tale of aging, marriage, family, friendship, commitment, and yes, death as well. However, I feel the main theme is love in all its forms. Ethel, Norman and Chelsea all love each other (though some of the relationships are hidden deeper), and they soon expand their circle to include Bill and Billy. It's the most honest movie I have ever seen. As Norman says to Ethel after his near-death experience, Hello there. Do you want to dance, or do you wanna just suck face?

Some genuine laugh out loud moments. Katharine Hepburn and Fonda have almost the type of witty repartee made legendary by the Hepburn/Tracy movies. Her acting style, while less mannered than, say Hepburn, is just not as entertaining and compares unfavourably. I think Hepburn is the highlight here, giving such an energetic and exuberant performance as Ethel, certainly one of her best.  Its a shame that she doesn't seem to realise her own fatality until the later stages of the movie because it would have been interesting to see how the character would reconcile certainty of death with her happiness. I like Jane Fonda as an actress, but her presence here slows things down. Its a difficult position to be in because the father/daughter relationship is a crucial one in the movie. Sometimes it strays towards the melodrama with lush strings music in the background.  Its not necessarily a bad thing but just be forewarned that rather than a serious meditation on life and death, its strictly Hollywood's take on it where everything is happily resolved by the conclusion.  If you want something more meaty about this subject try Bergman's 'Wild Strawberries' or Woody Allen's 'Another Woman'.

Audiences kept their hankies handy as two of Hollywood's most loved and respected stars turned it on as only they can.Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda were both completely in their element as an elderly couple who had retreated to their favourite holiday spot On Golden Pond to escape the madness of city life. When estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) drops in with her dentist boyfriend and his son, the generation gaps start to appear, painfully.Mark Rydell crafts a fine movie from Ernest Thompson's honest story about a family who all do a lot of growing up during one turbulent summer. As Ethel Thayer, Hepburn gives an assured performance of a woman tiring of her husband's constant complaining and his obsession with mortality, yet still unquestionably devoted to him. Fonda's cantankerous, grumpy old Norman Thayer Jnr. is wonderfully brought to life by the veteran actor who won an Academy Award for his trouble. In support of these two powerhouse performances was an impressive support cast which included Dabney Coleman, an up and coming young Doug McKeon and Jane Fonda, who delivered an emotionally charged showing as the Thayer's troubled, unhappy daughter.Billy William's camera captures some picturesque scenery and his images are accompanied by a melodic score from Dave Grusin.Notable as both a study of relationships and a tear jerker, On Golden Pond also garnered Oscars for Katherine Hepburn and Thompson's adapted screenplay (from his own 1978 play), as well as nominations for Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Fonda), cinematography, score, editing and sound.Henry Fonda completed a lifetime legacy of over fifty films before he passed away shortly after finishing this his last movie.Friday, December 30, 1994 - T.V.

Needless to say, the real star of this picture is Fonda himself playing the cranky and despondent old poop that is Norman Thayer.The whole point with this picture was moving away from the misconception that aging is something to fear in this world, but it is rather something that needs to be embraced and welcomed into one's life &#x96; including Norman. The relationship between the father and daughter of the picture is something of central significance throughout the play. Upon Jane Fonda's return in the final scenes of the movie to the idealistic image of her father bonding with her stepson in a way he never did quite did with her reinforces the idea that it is indeed never too late to reconcile the paternal bonds that had, at once, proved almost impossible to retain.What really stood out from this picture is the chemistry between the two lead roles; Hepburn and Fonda, in their Oscar-winning performances, appear to not capture the sexualized and lustful kind of chemistry but a kind that's most genuine, relatable and honest to audiences alike.The pictures traditional and authentic message resonates that we should quit the discrepancies and controversies of the past and aim to begin the path of forgiveness and reconciliation. Strangely, the weakest section of the picture was the undeveloped 'lack of bond' between Fonda's character and his daughter. The pair's scenes demonstrated a lack of raw emotion and total emptiness - odd considering the storyline appeared to showcase their real-life lack of paternal bonding in Jane's adolescent years.Nonetheless, no one can take away the simply beauty and treasure that is 1981's On Golden Pond. The picture's sweet and gentle plot focusing on an elderly man's search for a greater meaning to growing older in the form of the late Henry Fonda with his kind-hearted and sensible wife, the also late, Ms Katharine Hepburn.

Look, the loons, the loons are welcoming us back! magically encapsulates what their whole life was about loving each other, and spending summer On Golden Pond, they're a part of its history and it is a part of theirs. The images of the cottage with the magnificent nature surrounding it and interacting with the light of a rising or setting sun are absolutely dazzling, and never gratuitous. Rather than giving a sort of 'postcard' feeling to the film, they illustrate a sad reality nature is cyclical; people's lives are not. The lake has been freezing and thawing, the leaves got green, yellow, orange, fell and were back on trees, but Norman and Ethel Thayer got older. Yet Ethel enjoys life for what it is, while Norman seems to resent it. Ethel embraces life with positivity, Norman contemplates death and their daughter Chelsea still carries the frustrations of a tormented childhood.On Golden Pond deserves the title of being the ultimate movie about 'aging'. The protagonist's ages are seldom mentioned in movies, but maybe it's wrong. In real life, we do count the years, I just reached 30 and for me, it's big deal. Norman Thayer is 80, Ethel near 70, Chelsea's future husband (Dabney Coleman) is 45 and his son Billy Ray is 13, the film is the one that features the most lines about age, in order to establish a sort of hierarchy in attitude. The man who's 80 is allowed to act like a poop, the one who's 45 shyly asks him if he can share the same bed with his daughter, and with his 13-year old son, he displays authority. Chelsea almost commands Los Angeles, but with her father, she's a little girl again.That's life indeed, as if we all play characters within our true personality. That's what Norman does, and Coleman cleverly spots it when he finally retorts to his sarcasm by saying you like playing that game. That's what Billy Ray does too, by acting like the young adult who doesn't want to stick with the two old guys while his father and stepmother are having a good time in Europe. But it all leads up to the same conclusion bullshit, a word overused by the kid and Norman thinks it's a good word. At the end, they have to compose with each other and they do it through fishing, probably the best generation-bonding activity that ever existed, and a source of great emotional, and sometimes heart-pounding moments.On Golden Pond handles some of the most recognizable themes of family dramas, the unsolved parental conflict that poisoned Chelsea's life and filled her heart with anger and resentment, the grouchy old man in the twilight of his life with a sarcasm that is obviously a facade to hide a deep and tragic vulnerability, and in-between, the mother who struggles to reconcile them. But the reason I enumerate all these elements is not to point out how predictable is Mark Rydell's On Golden Pond, the adaptation of a 1979 play written by Ernest Thompson, but how great it is despite its predictability. And the reason the film succeeds is that it's true to life. And that's what elevates On Golden Pond into a true cinematic treasure it IS true to life. It has a unique capability to portray the inner strength and vulnerability of people in pivotal moments of their lives. I believed in the retired professor who celebrates his 80th birthday with a bitterness I could read in his eyes. I believed his devoted wife who's the only one who perceives the generosity, the genuine humanity of the man she spends most of her life with. And I believed in the daughter who endured her father's temperament and was jealous to see how easily her father got along with a boy who was 67-year older. In one extraordinary scene, Chelsea lets a bad word slip about her father, and although we could see the slap from her mother coming, it does resonate as a poignant and realistic moment.I guess I could go on and on the writing, and the directing, and there's no doubt they serve the film for good, but in On Golden Pond, acting is the driving force and the main reason we believe in these characters and feel for them, genuinely, immediately and deeply. Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda embodies the triangular relationship with such realism and authenticity, I've never felt at one moment, that they were playing characters. There's one moment where the kid Billy Ray Jr. (Doug McKeon) asks Fonda if he ever thinks about death. And the reason he does is quite simple, something in Thayer's attitude betrays, if not a fear, at least an obsession with aging, even sadder because Henry Fonda is the same age, and we know that he would die one year later. And Henry Fonda's last role would be one of his career's highlight, earning him the Oscar for Best Actor, fully deserved, as he was able to portray pathos and anger, but still pulling some comedy in it. Katharine Hepburn won for her performance as Ethel, she was perfect indeed. And when she delivered the extraordinary declaration of love, the famous shining armor speech, I could almost see her golden heart shining. And Jane Fonda left me speechless, she desperately needed to be her father's friend &#x85; before it's too late. And you could tell the father and the daughter some bits of their personal history. And On Golden Pond, it has an intimate, authentic feeling that makes the story personal; we do care for these people. The film succeeds as an unconventional family, love and coming- of-age story and, I repeat myself it's truly a cinematic treasure.

You also have to take on board that this is the only film to feature father and daughter Henry and Jane Fonda together, it was Henry's final film in a long and distinguished career (and Jane accepted, on his behalf, his Best Actor Oscar (the only Best Actor Oscar he won) for he was too ill too collect it), and Jane purchased the rights of the original stage play as a vehicle for them because she saw much in the relationship between Chelsea and Norman which parallelled the troubled relationship she had enjoyed with Henry. One imagines that she hoped that the reconciliation enjoyed by Chelsea and Norman would also be parallelled in her relationship with Henry, and it is gratifying to believe that a measure of this was achieved.These factors almost turn the piece into meta-fiction, and add a hugely touching air to an already perfect movie.

The other three were all rather large and ambitious films in their own different ways Louis Malle's Atlantic CITY, Spielberg's legendary RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and Warren Beatty's flawed but compelling REDS.Of these, I must give a nod to Spielberg, since it would still be a decade before he would get the recognition he deserved. But as good as RAIDERS is, my favorite film of 1981 is Mark Rydell's ON GOLDEN POND, a little film that was released very late in 1981 amid almost no fanfare, a surprising move considering its cast Henry Fonda in what would be his last film, Katharine Hepburn in the last role worthy of her, and Jane Fonda as the estranged daughter. I remember that the film came to town and just stayed, becoming a sleeper that before long everyone was talking about as the best thing they'd seen in years.Henry Fonda is Norman Thayer Jr, a retired professor facing his eightieth birthday with his wife Ethel (Hepburn) at their summer cottage on the titular pond (actually a good sized lake). Soon their estranged daughter Chelsea (Jane), a divorcée, arrives on the scene with her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) and his teenage son (Doug McKeon) in tow.The tension between Norman and Chelsea is almost palpable, yet it soon becomes obvious that these two have been mad at each other for so long that neither of them remembers why, despite a passing remark late in the film that seems to indicate that Chelsea felt she was a disappointment to her father just because she was a girl.Chelsea and her beau are off for a month in Europe, and she persuades her parents to take care of the boy while they're gone. Norman is a bit reluctant, but agrees.The eminent critic Roger Ebert, in his review of this film, had this to saySimple affection is so rare in the movies. Shyness and resentment are also seldom seen. Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? Fragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie, and the movies that reach for them are more daring, really, than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge, which are easy to portray.In the central section of the film, the old man and the boy uneasily move from suspicion to acceptance to friendship to something that looks very much like love. It is one of Fonda's greatest performances in a career of great work, and young McKeon is a revelation, holding his own against his two older co-stars with remarkable aplomb.Hepburn is in some ways the heart of the film. At the very beginning, when she calls her husband's attention to the sound of the loons, and he replies that he hears nothing, watch the look on her face. There are a lot of those looks. A great deal is communicated without dialogue in this film. Even the final confrontation between father and daughter is done with a minimum of talk, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during this scene.This is THE best picture of 1981, a small picture with a big heart that will surely affect even the most hardened moviegoer.

Jane Fonda & all the rest of the cast are strong support, but no doubt who stars in this one.The story is of an old couple aging, but not real gracefully. In fact, the couple is portrayed as well beyond their years. While the pond is indeed Golden, these folks are mercilessly losing their life coping mechanisms. Hepburn & Fonda hit these roles perfectly.They go up to the old summer home on the pond & open it up so the grandson can visit. The film does a nice job of filing in the old couples past life.

The photography is top class and the heavenly music sets the scene for what is to follow. We have a feeling that this will be their last visit.The acting techniques of these two veteran actors are a pleasure to watch. They make it look so easy. His grumpiness looks so natural and their little disagreements and arguments so believable. Katherine Hepburn can project a feeling of warmth and love as no other actress. Norman keeps talking about the end of his days and Ethel refuses to be depressed and cheerily plans their future.When daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) and her dentist friend Bill (Dabney Coleman) visit to celebrate Norman's birthday, with Bill's son Billy a little upstart of a kid, sparks start to fly and Norman meets his match across a generation gap. Billy is critical of everything including the fishing boat. I love the scene where the boat takes off at high speed sending Billy tumbling backwards. Billy learns how to bait a hook, use a net to lift a fish into the boat as they go searching for Walter the really big fish that has been around for years. The transformation of Billy's character as the film progresses is one of the most charming aspects of the story. Norman also changes as he comes to love Billy like a son.Norman being a retired school master introduces Robert Louis Stevenson's book Treasure Island to Billy. When Norman starts to boss people around Billy remarks&#133;Who does he think he is? Long John Silver? The script writing is great. What do you do in San Francisco when you're not at school? Cruise chicks. What do you do when you catch them? Suck face! Norman is beginning to learn how the other half lives. Learning from each other is a dual process. Be ready to laugh but have a tissue handy because emotions run high in this film.One of the most moving scenes in the film ( for me) is the time for departure when Billy says goodbye to Norman. There are many great scenes in this film covering many aspects of life. Well worth watching. And if you have any thoughts of becoming an actor, this film will show you how great actors ply their craft.

It not only has a fine script adapted by the playwright Ernest Thompson from his own play, but it benefits from the sensitive direction by Mark Rydell and a cast of superb actors.The story is rather simple Ethel (Katherine Hepburn) and Norman (Henry Fonda) Thayer have returned to their summer home beside Golden Pond and while they are elderly, their lives are still significant. They receive a rare visit from their distant daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) who stops by with her current boyfriend Bill (Dabney Coleman) to drop off Bill's ruffian teenage son Billy (Doug McKeon) to reluctantly stay with them while Chelsea and Bill are off to Europe. It is a battle of age differences Billy sees no future in starting a relationship with the old turkeys and Norman is resentful at the youth's attitude (Ethel is the wise mediator). Slowly but surely the three bond, age differences diminish as negatives and Billy sees Norman as a wise teacher he has never had. Chelsea returns at summer's end with her now husband Bill and faces confrontation with Norman for never being the father she needed Chelsea knows Norman has spent his life rejecting her because she was not the 'son' he wanted! Finally the family reconciles past differences and Ethel and Thayer face their aging and its effects as they listen to the loons on the lake.Hepburn, both Fondas, Coleman and McKeon give outstanding performances, but it is the knowledge that this was H. Fonda's last film and for all intents and purposes Hepburn's last film AND the only time the Fonda father/daughter team acted together on the screen that makes the film even more meaningful. The awards were many and well deserved, not only for the picture, but also for the actors and the production crew.

Two of Filmland's finest senior citizens get parts of a lifetime and due to the fact the daughter of one of them got them to co-star. Hard to believe, but according to both of them, Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn had never even met until the beginning of the making of On Golden Pond.This is a gentle story about a couple of people facing the twilight years, the man with more health problems than the woman. Among those problems are incipient Alzheimer's Disease for Henry Fonda. He's a crotchety old cuss by nature and the prospect of just going off into some twilight disturbs him and exacerbates that portion of his personality.Fonda and Hepburn are back at their summer home On Golden Pond for who knows what might be their last. Their daughter Jane Fonda brings them a surprise, a new fiancé in Dabney Coleman and his son from his previous marriage, Doug McKeon. Dabney and Jane are off to Europe and are depositing Doug with who will become his step grandparents.Almost in spite of himself McKeon connects with them, especially with Fonda with Jane Fonda becoming almost jealous. Apparently way back in the day Fonda wanted a son and let her know it. The trip is almost as much about her trying to patch things up with Fonda. Both Fondas drew from the strained relationship they've had over the years in their real lives.Despite over 45 years of work in film with many notable classic performances, Henry Fonda had only received one other Oscar nomination in 1940 for The Grapes Of Wrath. He was a sentimental favorite to win and sentiment and talent did win out. A lot of people knew he was in failing health at the time of the voting and there is that famous picture of daughter Jane presenting her father with the award at home the next day.Not that it wasn't merited, but Katharine Hepburn winning her fourth Best Actress Oscar really came out of left field though. Maybe Meryl Streep might surpass that some day, but Kate blazed a lot of trails in her professional life, honors only being one of them.I'm glad that the Academy voters in voting the Best Actor and Actress Awards recognized that Fonda and Hepburn were a matched pair. You could not award one without recognizing the contribution the other made. They both drew on their own experience and the considerable strength of each other to buttress their performances. Kate is as matched with Hank as she was in any of the films she did with Spencer Tracy.What a lucky kid that Doug McKeon was to do so many scenes and get lessons as a thespian by two of the very best. On Golden Pond is beautifully photographed in the New England locations of Hepburn's youth. It's a wonderful and touching story of the elderly as they await their inevitable end with as much grace as they can muster. A classic that will linger on in your memories for years.

Love is much talked-about, but how often do we really believe that the characters are in love and not simply in a pleasant state of lust and like? 'On Golden Pond' is a treasure for many reasons, but the best one, I think, is that I could believe it.The story of 'On Golden Pond' begins with the arrival of an old, long-married couple - retired professor Norman Thayer (Fonda) and his wife Ethel (Hepburn) - at the lakeside cottage where they have summered for many years. But this year they'll come to know their grown daughter, a teen visitor, and each other a little better. Obsessed with aging, Norman finds himself getting lost on walks and scarcely able to drive his boat anymore. To celebrate Norman's eightieth birthday, daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda - a commendable supporting act) arrives with new boyfriend Bill and Bill's rebellious teen son in tow. Chelsea and Bill plan for Billy Jr. to stay at the cottage while they head for a summer in Europe. The gruff Norman and the irritating Billy are immediately at odds - much as the father and daughter have always been. The two come to a better understanding of one another over the course of the summer, while Fonda also tries to come to terms with his mortality. Through learning to relate to the young boy, old Norman learns, belatedly, how to also trust his own daughter and communicate with her. When Chelsea returns, now married, will she manage to make up with her father before it's too late? Viewed simply as a stage plot,'On Golden Pond' is so predictable we can almost hear the gears squeaking. Forty-five minutes into the movie, almost everyone in the audience can probably predict what is going to happen to the characters, emotionally. And yet the movie transcends its predictability and the transparent role of the young boy, and becomes a film with passages of greatness.Mark Rydell directs Ernest Thompson's screenplay of pure gold with a lot of warmth, giving us an intricate interplay between the principal characters. But what imbues the movie with such poignancy is the standout performances by the two stalwarts. Katherine Hepburn is radiant as the sprightly matriarch, with her wide smile and warbling cry of Nooorman. In a performance without gimmicks, she communicates most of the film's emotional power as a portrait of the serenity and anger associated with old age. Her terror when Norman is felled by his angina attack is genuinely moving. Henry Fonda, as the grouchy old professor whose facade conceals a great deal of shyness, is appropriately crusty and there could have been no finer final curtain for him than this.'On Golden Pond' is a beautiful film, honoring nature as much as the survivors of human life. There is a natural rhythm to the film that makes its own quiet, life-affirming statement.

What is disappointing is not their ability in the film - they both won Oscars, rightfully so for Fonda, not so sure for Hepburn's fourth Oscar - but rather the fact that each of them had amazing movies such as 12 Angry Men for Fonda and The African Queen for Hepburn, yet they ended their careers on this simple and cheesy melodrama about aging.First, let's talk about what is done well - Henry Fonda's great performance as a senior citizen. We get all the humor we can get about an old man through Fonda's performance - he doesn't sound like himself at all, he'll make harsh jokes every now and then based on sexuality or race, he's extremely forgetful. But most of all, from a few key scenes we can clearly see that Thayer is afraid of death hitting him soon, even though this contradicts what he says throughout the movie. It is nearly heartbreaking (but also pretty cheesy) when his daughter confronts him towards the conclusion of the film about never acting as a true friend to her like he has been acting around Billy, who is Chelsea's soon-to-be stepson. It is a great moment to analyze whether their relationship has failed in the past based on gender or simply because Fonda's character was not a good father to Chelsea.Sadly, Fonda's performance along with that climactic moment about repairing his relationship with Chelsea are the only things of merit/interest for this film in my eyes. The main story is about Chelsea and her new fiancé Bill leaving Bill's son, Billy, with Chelsea's parents while they take a trip. What a weird decision to leave a thirteen year old kid alone with two elderly citizens whom he just met and is not even related to. Best parenting ever. While it is a delight to see Billy become friends with Norman, their journey is not that exciting at all except for when Norman and Billy become stranded on a rock in the middle of the pond after an accident.To put it simply, with actors of this particular caliber, their final movie could have been a lot stronger, but instead they starred in a decent melodrama at the end of their careers, not quite reaching the greatness of movies we come to expect from Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn.2.5/4.0 "},{"Title":"My Knight In Shining Armour","Date":"27 March 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" On Golden Pond deserves the title of something you don't see every day. Movies which deal with old age don't usually become box office hits in a world obsessed with being young, yet On Golden Pond became the 2nd highest grossing film of 1981. Plus it stars two elderly actors who hadn't appeared in a major box office picture in over a decade.Despite their six decades in the industry, not only was it the first time Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn starred in a film together, but they the first time they had even met each other. I never ceased to be amazed by the longevity of the careers of these two actors, especially Henry Fonda, whom I consider to have the most impress careers of any actor I've come across, scoring great films in every decade from the 30's right up to the 80's. On Golden Pond would be his last film, and what a way to end a career. On Golden Pond reflects Fonda's real life relationship with his children. Reportedly the man was emotionally distant from his children, as are characters of Norman and his daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) in On Golden Pond. It makes you wonder how much of the interactions between the Fondas in the film are genuine. Also what's up with the bikini shots Jane Fonda? Was she trying to promote her exercise videos?Norman Thayer actually reminds me of my own grandfather in how he enjoys screwing with people's minds, such as the scene in which his future son in law tries to ask him if he would have a problem with having sex with his wife in their house. Norman Thayer seems like a stereotypical old man at first, but we grow to sympathize with his character; he's a man nearing the end of his life played by a man who literally was nearing the end of his life. Compared to Henry Fonda's appearance in the film Meteor which he stared in two years earlier, he aged quite a lot in that short period of time.Katharine Hepburn is one badass old lady in this film. Just look at the scene in which jumps of a boat and into a lake to save her husband and nephew, and doing he own stunts too. She also reportedly told Jane Fonda on set that she hated her, but watching their scenes together you'd never know it. But she's Kate, she can hate whoever she wants. Plus it's nifty to hear old stars curse, as well as flipping the bird.

Putting as nice a bow on that situation as possible is the mission of this comedy- drama about an aging couple taking in life at their summer cottage; for me, a sturdy if low-key pleasure.Approaching his 80th birthday, retired professor Norman Thayer, Jr. (Henry Fonda) finds himself forgetting things. A lot of things. About the only thing he can remember is that he's standing at the edge of his actuarial table, and the more he brings up this fact, the more it annoys his longtime wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn). The arrival of their daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) adds friction to the pot.I think I'll start a new book so I can finish it before I'm finished myself, Norman tells Chelsea's new boyfriend Bill Ray (Dabney Coleman). When he picks up one he's read before, he just shrugs My mind is going, so it'll all be new to me.This kind of humor pops up a lot in On Golden Pond, which along with the beautiful Billy Williams cinematography and immersive set design, make it a kind of destination spot among movies. You don't watch it for story or even character development as much as an amiable place where quiet, rueful beauty reigns. An opening shot of the title lake (set in Maine, filmed in New Hampshire) transformed into burnished copper by a rising (or setting) sun is pure heaven.The syrup runs pretty thick on this pancake. Director Mark Rydell does a fine job recreating the Thayers' quiet pattern of life, but occasionally reaches for a bigger moment that isn't there, like Norman trying to find his way out of some woods. Composer Dave Grusin gets so busy with his trills and minor chords, he never develops an engaging central melody. Hepburn delivers one of her typical kabuki performances, with much too much eye-flashing and hand-waving.She's not one of my favorite actors, but here at least she has the right counterweight in Henry Fonda. He has the Norman character down so well it never feels like acting with him. You see the pain and fear in his eyes, but when he talks, it's in a low growl with W. C. Fields overtones. As Hepburn pushes, he pulls back, and the result feels like you are watching a real couple who have been together for decades, not a pair of movie stars who never met before this shoot.He has many great scenes here. My favorite is the awkward comedy when he teases Bill Ray about sleeping with his daughter, a scene Coleman also plays very well. It's odd seeing Coleman acting so awkward and uncomfortable, given the hard-case types he usually plays, but it's easy to understand with Old Man Thayer giving him the third degree. He should have done light comedy more often.The real-life situation of making On Golden Pond was at least as interesting as the movie. They shot it on location and around an actors' strike, and the set was apparently a tense one. A commentary track with screenwriter Ernest Thompson is especially illuminating and candid, talking about the challenges of reconfiguring his Broadway play around a cast and director who didn't always share his vision. At times, you can see where they got it right, especially in the second-half scenes where Norman teaches chippy young Billy Ray (Doug McKeon) about fishing on the lake. Overall, they went for a more dramatic flavor than the play had, and seem to get the balance right; a bit soppy, a bit heavy, affecting in the right places but never overbearing.Much of the talk about this movie centers around the troubled real- life relationship Fonda had with his daughter, something I feel is a burden to On Golden Pond. For one thing, it's a distraction to the Thayer situation the film is supposed to be about. For another, the relationship between father and daughter, whether Thayer or Fonda, isn't so much developed or resolved as it is waved aside in a wink and a hug. I didn't care about Chelsea at the end of the film and doubt anyone else did, either.What On Golden Pond does offer is atmosphere, and a lot of it. The interiors of the Thayer house are so marvelously furnished and lit, I just want to hang out inside them and listen to Norman grouse at whoever has the misfortune of visiting, as long as it's not me.

When those two elderly people are the legendary Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn, the curiosity is definitely a factor in attracting audiences, but quick great reviews and excellent word of mouth made this pack audiences in. Even the young film audiences in a year filled with Raiders of the Lost Ark, Clash of the Titans and Arthur flocked to see this, and now they are passing their discovery onto their own children.Norman Thayer is the epitome of the grouchy octogenarian who has been estranged from his daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) for many years. She has remained close to her mother Ethel (Thounds like I'm listhsping, Norman says in a more lighthearted moment as he reveals that her impending married name almost kept him from meeting her down the church aisle) but the rebellious teenaged years and not so understanding, strict father kept her from establishing a close bond with him as an adult. Now she's engaged to dentist Bill Ray (Dabney Coleman in a role a far cry from his lecherous boss in Nine to Five, also with Jane) and soon to be stepmother to his son Billy Ray (Doug McKeon) whom she wants Norman and Ethel to take care of while she goes on a trip to Europe with Coleman. Much to Ethel's delight, Norman and Billy begin to bond, and when Chelsea returns, she finds herself envious over the new friendship which she has pined for but never pursued.Many of us can identify with the cold relationship between Norman and Chelsea, as well as Norman's bonding with the young boy who doesn't seem to fear him as Chelsea obviously did. The entire cast gives bravo performances, but it is the Oscar Winning Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn (her fourth!) who dominate here. At times, you do want to slap Jane like Cher did to Nicolas Cage in Moonstruck and yell, Snap out of it!, but as she discloses, even a successful businesswoman can find her old insecurities rising when confronted with a past she hasn't been able to get over. Katharine is wise and understanding, but even she isn't above disciplining her embittered daughter. That son of a bitch is my husband!, she reminds Jane. To see father and daughter working together after so much history of differences in their own lives and really bonding is touching, as it is to see Henry and Kate together in their first and only film. Then, there's seeing the rebel of the 1930's (Kate) with the rebel of the 70's (Jane), and there is magic in this mother/daughter pairing.McKeon strikes a cord here, too, working well with the older actors, especially Henry. The direction by Mark Rydell is superb, and the lake setting is gorgeous. I can tell you from experience that having spent several summers on New England set lakes in cottages exactly like this, the movie's reality level increased for me because of how similar it looked. Dave Grusin's music is also gorgeous, whether profound and sad as the opening credits play, to triumphant as McKeon takes the Thayers boat out on his own, to bittersweet as the closing credits roll after Ethel and Norman have bid farewell to their summer home which we all hope will not be their last there together. This has been successfully remade for T.V. and revived on Broadway, but there will never be another version like this, and it will enter your heart for eternity just as Kate says lovingly to Norman, You are my knight in shining armor. Keep the handkerchief handy, even if this is a repeat viewing.

Like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958) and The Lion in Winter (1968) it is about inter- generational family dysfunction, and it seems to want to embarrass or shock the audience through a frankness of discourse. It is the kind of script that purports to peel away the supposedly-artificial niceties of middle-class life to get to the meat of matters, which in the minds of these kinds of playwrights always seems to mean sex and death. Tennessee Williams and James Goldman made that format dance, and watching the great Hollywood versions of their works is thrilling because of the way they constantly try to set new records for speed and intensity and brutal honesty. On Golden Pond imitates these classics but with a lower degree of commitment. It's slower and gentler, and it never seems to let a barb stand unaccompanied by a sappy line or a nostalgic musical cue. It's a movie that's easy to like, because it's a suger-coated pill. As Williams and Goldman knew, there's nothing challenging about a sugar-coated pill. To them, the purpose of writing characters who speak in a forthright way about difficult issues was to make us face our fears and anxieties, and their genius was to do this while also being entertaining. On Golden Pond wants to do these things, but it wants to go down easy. That impulse is not altogether a bad one; compare it with another play adaptation, 1966's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, which aims to scream the loudest and cut the deepest only to end up as thoroughly unlikable as its characters. Toward the beginning, On Golden Pond echoes Virginia Woolf as Henry Fonda's irascible old poop tries to discomfit a polite younger man with blunt sexual talk. By the middle of the movie, though, this riff on Edward Albee's hard-edged approach gives way to a much sweeter narrative about an unlikely friendship between Fonda's 80-year-old and a 13-year-old boy. It's nice, but it's predictable and safe and familiar and forgettable whereas its predecessors succeeded by being none of those things. Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda are believable, though, and Jane Fonda threatens to upstage both of them as their adult daughter whose eyes betray an inner mixture of depression and resentment and a certain flightiness born of self-doubt. If nothing else, what On Golden Pond shares in full measure with its more ambitious and significant forerunners is magnificent acting by a top-shelf cast.

It isn't by accident that I choose to link the greatest writer the world has ever known with one I'd never heard of prior to this movie because Ernest Thompson has adapted his own Broadway play for the screen brilliantly but even the finest screenplay ever written can only do so much without the right actors and here we have two of the all-time greats in Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda. Hepburn astounds from the very first scene when, in late middle-age she evokes with ease a girlish enthusiasm that many an actress in her thirties would be hard put to equal. Fonda is not called upon for such bravura thesping and so it's easy to believe he isn't acting at all and that, of course, is the hallmark of a great actor. As if these two central performances in a magnificent screenplay were not enough we also get, for good measure, the breathtaking scenery of Concord, New Hampshire, which may or may not remind us of Concord, Massachussetts, where a guy named Thoreau turned out another classic when he published a diary of the eighteen months or so he spent in a cabin by another pond. Rounding things off is a gentle, evocative score by Dave Grusin so all in all we're talking perfection.

Although she would make a couple of other films, this may also be considered Hepburn's curtain call. It is a pleasure to watch these two great stars end their careers in Oscar-winning performances. In the only film in which they worked together, one wonders how much of the tension between the characters played by Henry and Jane is a reflection of the strained relationship between the two actors.

Basically ageing couple Ethel Thayer (Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated Katharine Hepburn) - who almost didn't marry because the name sounded like lisping, LOL - and Norman Thayer Jr. (Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Henry Fonda) live together in their summer home on Golden Pond. On Norman's birthday, they are visited by his daughter Chelsea Thayer Wayne (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jane Fonda), who brings along fiancé Bill Ray (Inspector Gadget's Dabney Coleman) and his son Billy (Doug McKeon), and they ask that they look after him while they go off and get married. The story explores the relationships between the old couple, both of them spending time with a new soon-to-be family member, and of course, the daughter and her father do sort out their differences towards the end. There is Norman being amusingly rude and over-opinionated, there is Ethel being dotty and always in a good mood, there is Chelsea getting on with Ethel pretty well and (apart from the end) ignoring her father, there is the young boy enjoying fishing trips with his new old friend, and there is a little bit of the fiancé embarrassed. Also starring William Lanteau as Charlie Martin and Christopher Rydell as Sumner Todd. Fonda and Hepburn really deserved their Oscars for both creating such a lovable old couple, with their own individual likable traits also, and both not in the greatest health at the time, remarkable. Daughter Fonda and the young McKeon also add to the film's charm, a great melodrama with all the right ingredients. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Director for Mark Rydell, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dave Grusin, Best Sound and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Direction and Best Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Director.

The grandson was left to spend time with his grandparents for the summer. Henry Fonda plays his role exceptionally as a grumpy old man. The kid did a great job as well. I loved the way those two bonded and developed as the film went one. The grandpa, Norman, is a complex character who seems like an indifferent and unsympathetic man, but begins to show that he is a real human being. Billy discovers the special qualities of his grandpa during the numerous fishing excursions and hangouts with him. There are light touches of humor here and there. One of my favorite parts was the conversation between Norman and the kid's father.

Jane Fonda, Henry's real-life daughter, has some nice scenes as the couple's daughter who comes to visit with her boyfriend and his son. There is obviously tension between the father Norman and the daughter Chelsea. However, through many situations, all the relationships here will be tried and changed.To put it straight, this is in my mind, mediocre material that is uplifted tremendously by some of the finest acting ever put on the screen. Henry Fonda, in his own way, puts together a great character in Norman Thayer Jr., a successful, self-loathing, even cantankerous man who dreads having to die some day and takes his fear out on others. Jane Fonda is the successful daughter who has had a strained relationship with her dad but realizes this may be the last chance for them to fix it. And in the middle is Katharine Hepburn, the wonderfully charming mother and wife who knows how to enjoy life and does everything in her power to help her family reconcile as well as have a good time.Even though the acting is superb, I felt the story and situations were just okay and could have been much better to match the acting and make this and absolute classic. Still, that is a small trouble in an otherwise wonderful story about family, life, death, and knowing that it could all be gone in a second. And of course, this being the last film for Henry Fonda, it is a great send-off for a great actor to end his great career.

Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda play the Thayers, who have come to their house on the lake for the summer. Norman Thayer seems to be on the edge of mild dementia, as he gets lost while on the grounds and seeks reassuring from his wife Ethel. He also hasn't patched things up with his daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) who also arrives with her fiancée Bill (Dabney Coleman) and future son Billy (Doug McKeon) in tow. Chelsea and Bill are on their way for their own vacation and ask the Thayers to keep check on their son. Friction erupts in minor quakes from the start -- Norman isn't the most congenial of people and age has clearly only intensified his curmudgeonly nature -- but it's the bonding that later occurs with young Billy and Norman where most of the movie develops its story, as this brings forth much of Chelsea's old wounds.It sounds predictable and borderlines on the premise of a sitcom or one of the more recent, emotionally charged shows tailor-made for a female audience, but ON GOLDEN POND is quite a movie. I don't think it's the acting from its entire cast, namely being the dominant presences of Katharine Hepburn and Henry Fonda who are in the movie for most of its run and convincingly play a married couple. There's an added element here, one that has become more and more relevant in films of today where stories that rely more on setting than power-plots are in demand. Films rarely focus on the twilight of people's lives and this one is all about that, even presenting a character that we may not appreciate but who is going through a mild case of memory loss. Also, to see two women perform minor athletics -- Hepburn, diving off to rescue her own husband; Jane Fonda doing a back-flip in a scene where she makes amends with her father -- is worthy the price of admission. A fine movie, delicate and soft, one of these rare pictures that take place in their own nostalgic universe.

Their quiet time is interrupted by the arrival of their semi-estranged daughter Jane Fonda, her current fiancé Dabney Coleman and his sassy young son Doug McKeon. When McKeon is left behind with the old folks, he develops a bond with Henry that Jane feels resentful of upon her return.Hollywood and critics were positively atwitter over this film, which was basically a love letter from Jane to her dad Henry. Adapted from an acclaimed stage play, Jane purchased the rights specifically so her father could take the lead role and convinced legendary Hepburn to take the co-starring part. Unfortunately, the end result is mawkish, overly sentimental treacle akin to one of those gooey Hallmark cards for the over-70 crowd.Alas, there is not much drama in watching Henry and Kate meander aimlessly around the lake house and the film pads itself with endless lingering shots of the golden sunlight glinting off the wilderness settings. Fans of the legendary acting duo no doubt will be thrilled seeing their favorites together, but even the most die-hard Fonda and Hepburn fan will have to admit that there is not much here for one to sink their teeth into.Oscar really seemed to love this film, but it is hard to see precisely why. While it is great that Fonda finally got the Oscar that had proved elusive, to say that this role is not much of a stretch for him is an understatement. By contrast, the Oscar for Hepburn is much harder to fathom. She was coming into this already with an unprecedented three Best Actress Oscars, so there was no requirement to recognize her and the role of the wife, Ethel, is positively stillborn. Hepburn seems to recognize this fact and compensates by playing it to the rafters. She sputters, she gesticulates, she shoots out sauciness, she gets positively dewy-eyed when discussing her love, and, in one incredibly embarrassing and excruciating moment, she launches into an impromptu song and dance for no discernible reason. Hepburn is almost assuredly suffering from that deadliest of acting diseases - the BIG actress in an underwhelming role.Even worse, poor Jane is stuck playing a total cliché - the resentful daughter. The screenplay gives her nothing to work with and other than the opportunity to see her opposite her dad on screen, there are no rewards in this role. It is interesting to see Fonda paired romantically with Coleman, who was her diabolical boss in 9 to 5, but he also is trapped in a nothing part. Of the supporting roles, only the appealing McKeon is able to make an impression and he has rarely been glimpsed on the screen since then.The end result is inoffensive, but not exactly an edge of your seater. I would optimistically tell fans of Henry, Kate or Jane to seek them out in some of their far better films and not waste their time on this sappy travelogue, but they would not listen anyway. Some of the photography is quite lovely, but diabetics are definitely warned to brace themselves for some truly sloppy sentiment and sugar highs. And fans of great dialog will no doubt still cringe over the Let's suck face line, which remains as dreadful today as it was in 1981.

They've been coming here for years but Norman feels that this could be his last trip to one of his favorite places on Earth. Norman was always a bitter man but over the past few years he has become even more bitter now that he is starting to think about death. His wife Ethyl on the other hand rarely thinks about death and is becoming quite angry at Norman for only thinking about it.On his eightieth birthday their daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) comes by for a visit and brings her new boyfriend (Dabney Coleman) as well as his 13-year-old son Billy (Doug McKeon). For Chelsea this is a return to hell because she has never gotten along with her father and Norman does his best to throw insults her way. Since Chelsea and her boyfriend want to travel to Europe, Norman and Ethyl agree to look after Billy for a month. At first the young kid isn't too happy about spending time with an older couple but soon he and Norman become friends and the two start learning from one another.From the opening credits of On Golden Pond the viewer should know every step this movie is going to take. They should expect the feisty old man to have a change of heart and they should expect a bunch of tender moments to go with the laughs. I really can't say there's anything new with On Golden Pond but from those opening credits to the close, this is without a doubt one of the sweetest and most enlightening films ever made. Everyone has their own ideas of beauty but I think this film captures all the spirits of life and rolls them together for one incredible movie that won't be easy to forget.Although the story is pretty predictable that really isn't a negative comment because this is a showcase for its stars Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn. These two legendary actors turn in some of the finest work in their careers, which is one of the most charming things about the picture. Fonda, in pretty much his swan song, turns in a performance that ranks right up there with classics like 12 Angry Men and Once Upon a Time in the West. There isn't a false step to be spotted anywhere. From the opening scenes of him complaining about life to his rather mean spirited sense of humor, everything comes off without a hitch. This is a role an actor can really sink their teeth into and Fonda simply shines in one of his most unforgettable characters. The scenes with his character and Hepburn are wonderfully touching but most important they feel all too real. The stuff with the younger kid makes for some wonderful laughs because you've got a feisty old man and a feisty younger kid finding that they have something in common. Then there's Fonda's relationship with his daughter, which is the most predictable aspect of the film yet it's also the most heartwarming. We see the ending coming from a mile away but because Fonda has created a full dimensional person we can't wait until that ending comes and when it does tears will fill your eyes.Hepburn on the other hand is the perfect companion and also gives her character a full dimension to her, which makes us know every little thing about her. Whenever she's upset with her husband that anger shows through but instead of a boring monologue we can see exactly what she's feeling just by looking at her eyes and her body movement. There's a brilliant scene between her and Jane Fonda at the end of the film, which shows exactly why Hepburn was loved by so many. Jane Fonda also turns in a nice performance, although her character's basically just here for the ending with her father. Seeing the real life father and daughter working together just makes the film seem all the more real. Doug McKeon also adds wonderful support and makes a perfect buddy to Henry Fonda.On Golden Pond might not be the greatest film ever made but as I said earlier it's one of the sweetest films and most of the most touching. What I enjoyed most about the film, other than the performances, was how natural the movie felt. There isn't a single false moment in the film, which is something very rare especially in today's world. The movie has a little bit of everything, which is exactly what life offers and that's exactly what the film is about. There are tears, serious speeches, heartache, pain, laughs, good times and most importantly there are friends. On Golden Pond is wonderfully entertaining and most importantly it's a movie that will keep a smile on your face throughout. Not too many movies can offer so much emotions yet they are all captured in this one little film about an old couple spending time at a cherished pond.

Had the Fondas and Hepburn not starred in it, I doubt whether it would be as well known - and had the on-screen father/daughter relationship not resonated with the cagey relationship shared by Henry and Jane Fonda, it may have received even less attention than it has.The three principle actors are all very good in their roles, as you would expect. Although much is made about the father/daughter aspect, Chelsea (Jane Fonda) as a character is largely sidelined. This is more a film about growing old, about our fear of death and of the inability of some to express how they feel about those who matter in their life until it is (almost, in this case) too late. Norman's fears - he appears to be on the verge of dementia some times and is subject to chest pains - have made him crotchety and angry in his old age. Luckily for him, wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn) is a veritable angel with an endless supply of patience. Younger Norman was obviously a different man, and the pair of them, like the loons to which they repeatedly refer, share an unbreakable bond that will ensure they remain mates for life. Norman's antagonistic relationship with his daughter boils down to her (probably correct) belief that Norman always wanted a son but, for my money, everything seems to come to a head just a little too late in Chelsea's life. Surely, two such strong characters would have locked horns when she was in her late teens/early twenties, but no mention of any earlier confrontations are made. The reconciliation, when it comes, is incredibly brief - amounting to little more than the realisation that they have both mistakenly believed that the other has hated them for years. So, after that confusion is cleared up, everything is hunky dory. In fact their reconciliation is so trite and carelessly written that it makes them both look fickle and self-absorbed and diminishes the worth of much of what has come before. "},{"Title":"Wow!

No worries though; everything ends happily and Jane is finally able to do back flips off the pier at her parents' lakeside home (or whatever it is she ends up doing), a talent that bears the symbolic import of encapsulating all the ways she feels like a failure in her father's eyes.I doubt the movie would have been half as well received by the movie public had it not had the gimmick of a real-life father and daughter (whose personal relationship was also known to be strained) playing themselves and had the world not suspected that Henry Fonda wouldn't be around much longer. The world was right -- he would win an Oscar for this film and then promptly die. God knows the man deserved an Oscar, but not for this. And don't even get me started on Hepburn's win....Grade C "},{"Title":"Writer Ernest Thompson lives up to his name--he's dismally earnest","Date":"29 May 2005","Score":"8 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" One-Kleenex weeper about wily old curmudgeon and his wife taking in their estranged daughter's boyfriend's teenage son for the summer. Ernest Thompson adapted his hit play (and won an Oscar) but his material is hoary, pedagogic in the most condescending way, and unbelievably ham-handed. It's also so plastic that the capable cast can't overcome the theatricality of the entire occasion (this is the kind of movie where an early phone conversation with the local operator leads nowhere--she never even calls back as promised--it's just there to tell us how isolated in Mayberry we are). This is perhaps the worst performance by Jane Fonda I've seen, but of course she's stuck with a terrible role; her father's acid-tongued jabs at her are designed to appeal to us in the audience, while her resentment of being put-down by him is a signal for us to think she's a heartless bitch. Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn won Oscars for their work in the leads, and they have a couple of sterling--indeed golden--moments together, but this is a very patchy vehicle, lightened by 'with it' humor and a fake-sincere happy ending. ** from **** "}{"Title":"Horrible","Date":"18 March 2015","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" I tried to watch this movie after hearing nothing but good reviews. Wow, I wish that I could rewind time and tell myself to go count grass blades out in the yard. Everything in this movie was about as hard as sandpaper. The friend of the child in the movie, Dave Hone, was a very odd kid. He didn't fit in the movie and was always saying thing that were not true. He said his favorite wrestler in the movie was a man named Rowdy Roddy Python. That person is close but not the same. Save yourself some time and just play with a pencil or eraser. And in the middle of the movie when the boat crashed into a rock, if you slow it down you can see something very funny. The rock is actually a very large tube sock filled with matchbox cars. Not goo effects at all.

That script is more or less preserved here, in equally vacuous form. All the crew director and such are mere children along on the camping trip with the three principles. With their permission and ours, they hijack this film to take it places that have nothing to do with the script.Everyone knows the story somewhat damaged daughter Jane tries to reconcile with her dying, wooden Dad by creating a film world in which they can relate. She did, he gets his Oscar and dies.But there's some more interesting elaboration here. These three actors all agree to one last serious project before ending their careers. But all three are from radically different acting traditions. Worse, each is a thoroughly uninteresting person in real life - rather incomplete - they all come alive on screen in different ways and become not only more complete, but attractively so.Kate is an engineered person. A hardass driver who learned that the public doesn't like hardass woman. So she consulted with the best, commissioned a play tailored to invent a new persona, polished it on stage and made a comeback with `Woman of the Year.' She doggedly stuck to that persona (and love) all her professional life. She is a selfish actress. She focuses on character at all costs, even when the story, situation and partnership with others suffers. We tolerate it because she has created an appealing personality, exemplified here in her solitary camp song dance. Hollywood loves this stuff.Henry is almost the complete opposite. He is an intuitive who has little control over his own personality. His talent is in understanding how an actor can invest energy in a scene or situation. He is `unselfish' in this regard. His moment of genius was as the guiding light behind `12 Angry Men' which is a case study in continuity among many actors and an understanding of acting with space. But poor Henry lost his fire early in the game. Possibly the lowest moment was `Tenticles,' where he had no control over anything, self included. Hollywood hates THIS stuff.Jane is wholly different hungry for engagement and part of the `method' school which requires an investment of self in the character. She requires sharing and intensity. Hollywood likes this sort of actor because they show up and work their buns off. In her world, nothing matters at all except the connection among actors.Toss them together in a project where each knows it is their last, where each is desperate for success, and you get this three rather unintegrated grandstands. Of these, I appreciated only Henry, and only in the scene of panic in the woods. That was the man we knew, working with space and unencumbered by the mechanics of the women.All that is by way of commenting on what we see, which has little to do with the characters and everything to do with the actors. I call this `folding,' when the reality of the production is somehow acknowledged IN the production.  I only wish that these energies would have been understood and accommodated by the script and/or director.The DVD contains an `extra,' one of those `making of' documentaries. Usually they are listed individually by IMDB but not in this case. It consists of two stories one of the frail, dying distant Dad, conflated in actor and character. The other is offensively banal the story of the (Oscar-winning!) screenwriter who is a dumb as his script and guess what? so is the story about him.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

Wow, what entertainment! Sarcasm aside, this was brutal movie to watch when I saw it at the theater. Rarely I have squirmed so much in my seat, wishing this thing would end and someone would put Norman Thayer Jr. (Henry Fonda) out of his misery and end this depressing story. It - and he, meaning Henry Fonda - wasn't just uncomfortable; it/he was irritating. I actually gave it another shot on VHS 10 years later, but couldn't finish it.Don't let the fact this won three Oscars fool you. That was mainly a totally-sentimental vote for the dying Fonda. (He passed away the year after this was made.) His character in here not only was beyond annoying, but also obnoxious. Add in the usually obnoxious Katharine Hepburn and the always-irritating Jane Fonda and you have a real downer of a film. However, it was Mr. Fonda's character, not the two women, that was too much to bear.Summary a depressing and vastly overrated film, about as much fun as the proverbial root canal at the dentist's office.

One keeps expecting Will Geer to appear.And who better to interpret this type of thing, than the dessicated Hank Fonda and Kate Hepburn, both of whom had long since discarded their by now forgotten, (but oh how much more appealing!) suaver selves in the more moth eaten environs of the RKO prop department.Visually the film is suffused with Vermont travelogue optics--stereotypical slanting sunbeams on the lake ad nauseam, and it must be added, to the point that the whole thing looks like a very extended margarine commercial.The script follows suit--for amidst the unbearable sentimentality, it takes pains to contain all the Norman Learish style hep touches--scatological humor, profanities, etc. (after all, lest we forget, Jane Fonda is in this too) meant to assure the audience that, we are dealing with real people, that this is in fact the late 20th century, and Ozzie and Harriet don't live here any more. As an illustration, we are treated to such gems as Let's suck face!. Yes, it really is THAT BAD.In short, it has all the sham sincerity of a Hallmark greeting card for an Octagenerian. You know the type--with the oaken bucket and the black eyed Susan peeping out? Diabetics are herewith advised to avoid.Those seeking a better take on these basic themes are herewith directed to I Never Sang for My Father or The Whales of August.

Neither Henry Fonda nor Katharine Hepburn have ever been favorites of mine, and this offering did nothing to alter that. And not only do I not care for Jane Fonda, but I have found her screen presence thoroughly annoying every time I've seen her (in this film, and, for example, in the earlier Barefoot in the Park, and the later 9 to 5). Henry's character may be the most obnoxious since Andy Griffith's Lonesome Rhodes in A Face in the Crowd. But the latter contained an engaging performance, an interesting character, as well as entertaining story and collateral performances. Henry looks like he's playing someone 100 instead of 80 (and I'm not referring to his infirmities of age which can appear even earlier than 80 - but rather to his acting). I'd much rather watch Martin Short doing Katharine Hepburn than see her doing herself. While normally one can enjoy a movie and the role an actor portrays without letting knowledge of his/her real-life persona interfere (can there be a better example than Jack Nicholson) -- in this film, I was also distracted by the knowledge that all three principals have had screwed-up off-screen lives - and the Fondas' off-screen history may be worse than in the story here. To all who seemed to love this film, its actors and characters, sorry that these icons - for so many - just aren't mine.
