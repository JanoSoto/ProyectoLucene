I can just imagine Ken sitting around his kitchen table with his casting director saying okay we have this brilliant ensemble cast, the movie is going to be great, what can we do to completely screw it up? I know let's cast Keanu Reeves as Don John and completely snarl up the whole thing Personally I think Keanu made a great villain, and I trust Ken's ability in casting to choose the perfect actor for the part.  I do not think that in reality that Ken would cast someone so hopelessly inept as others have posted in a part that is so essential to the plot.  (and don't give me the star power excuse cause they already had Denzel Washington)..., I have always said that Shakespere done right is brilliant.. (done poorly it is pathetic)  and this is Shakespere done right in the purest sense of the term.  To listen to Ken and Em deliver Shakespere's lines is to listen to them as they would have been spoken and acted when they were written.  It is a revelation and pure joy.

Do you think of obscure, lowbrow Elizabethan humour that MAYBE someone was kind enough to explain in a footnote?Certainly the comedies are harder to stage, but when they're well done ...  One of the most exhilarating things about Shakespeare is the certain knowledge that no character will ever express himself poorly.  Well, characters like Dogberry do, in a sort of a way, but that's deliberately done for comic effect and doesn't count.  No character is ever thwarted by a lack of expressive power.  Whenever Benedick must plead his case, you know that he will summon up all the eloquence he needs; and whenever Beatrice insults anyone, you know that she will summon up all the venom and wit SHE needs.  In some ways it's easier to appreciate this in a comedy when the plot is, reduced to its essence, much ado about nothing.No film director working today can approach Branagh when it comes to presenting Shakespeare cleanly and clearly, in a way that lets us participate in this verbal delight.  This particular film is actually funny, as well as verbally delightful.  It's also visually delightful - it has an attractive cast (Kate Beckinsale plays one of Shakespeare's ciphers but makes us understand why people fell in love with her), a sunny Tuscan landscape and a long tracking shot at the end that has to be seen to be believed.  Performances are all good (other comments here have convinced me that even Keanu Reeves fits into his role).  Comedy or not, this is the best Shakespeare film in years and is a candidate for being the best of all time. "},{"Title":"Truly Wonderful! A great movie!","Date":"9 November 2001","Score":"66 out of 78 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Brilliant!  Kenneth Branagh's version of the timeless William Shakespeare classic is a great rendition of the film, making it accessible to everyone, even those who do not like Shakespeare.Let me first say that I am a great fan of Shakespeare's works.  In college I was an English literature major, with a minor in theater, and so Shakespeare is found in both.  Theater people state that Shakespeare was never literature at all, which in the purpose of the plays is true, however because of the prose that he wrote in is a poetic form, he is literature as well.  Whatever you do, never get in between two people arguing this point, your head might blow up!Reading the comments on this page, the basic attack on this movie is that Branagh cuts lines and shaved parts.  Yes, of course he did.  Nothing is sacred, not even the works of Shakespeare, people.  I myself was in a Shakespeare play, and over half the script was cut from it.  With a Shakespeare play, the question is what to cut.  If this play had been presented in it's entirety, it would have been close to five hours long. And today's movie audience just does not have that kind of patience.  Titanic was stretching it a little, in terms of time.  Shakespeare's original audience would have had no problem, because they made a day of it.So when Branagh did this play, he had to shave off a great deal of the script, and he had to decide what to focus on.  He had to focus on the main characters, being Beatrice and Benedict and their romance, and of course the drama concerning Hero and Claudio, but also keep other characters incorporated as well.  For those attacking the whittling down of the script, why didn't anyone bring up the point that Benedict is supposed to have shaved his beard while in attempt to woo Beatrice.  Why?  Because it really isn't a major plot point that is needed at all.  So Branagh made great choices in his direction of the film, and in the end he made sure that everything tied together logically, and that there were no loose ends.The performances by the actors were great as well.  There was nothing wrong with casting Denzel Washington as the prince, though people seem to have a beef with it.  He pulled it off very well.  And Keanu Reeves did a great job as well.  It was a treat to see him as a villain.  I happen to be a fan of Reeves, and I do see him as great casting, though why people also have a problem with him I'll never know.  Branagh was going for acting ability, not just names.  Reeves has the goods, and he can speak Shakespeare very well, it's his character that's supposed to be moody.  And Keaton was a wonderful choice for the Constable, making me laugh whenever he was on the screen.  And the other actors all did very well in their roles.If you're a lover of Shakespeare or not, this film is a great treat, and it appeals to all audiences who love the classic masterpiece.

This screen adaptation of one of Shakespeare's lesser-known comedies is absolutely divine. The lovers Claudio and Hero are completely and wonderfully upstaged by Benedick and Beatrice, the most perfectly mismatched pair in the history of love, exactly as they were meant to be. The chemistry between Ken and Emma is so believable (after all, this was filmed before their marriage ended), the lines are so cunningly delivered, and the plot is so beautifully twisted and resolved that this movie is at the very top of my list of favorites. The setting is absolutely gorgeous--Italy in all its Summer glory. You can fairly taste the sunshine. Each part is completely delightful (Michael Keaton is perfect in one of the most bizarrely comedic roles I've ever seen, and as far as Keanu Reeves' performance, all I can say is that the part was written to be played in that manner. Don John was a bad guy of necessity--every comedy must have a foil). I found the entire production to be beautifully done and quite up to the professional standards that I've come to expect under Branagh's excellent direction. The wit sparkles and cracks between Beatrice and Benedick; a direct counter to the more traditional and borderline sappy form of Elizabethan love exhibited between Hero and Claudio. *This* is how the wise woo, and no, it is never peaceably! A smart, funny and visually stunning gem of a film to add to Branagh's already distinguished repertoire. I'm waiting for his MacBeth.

To pass the time Don Pedro makes a pledge to engage confirmed bachelor Benedick and the bickering Beatrice together in a tower of affection.  However Claudio's brother, Don John, conspires to break up the wedding by making accusations against young Hero.  Will it all be much ado about nothing?If anyone has done more to bring Shakespeare to a modern audience of multiplex dwellers, I'd like to meet them.  Here Branagh yet again adapts a Shakespeare play to good effect, trimming the dialogue of some important sections with the aim of creating a lighter feel worthy of the title.  I make no mention of the plot suffice to say that Branagh has done well to keep the essence and feel of the work very true but without forcing the tools that Shakespeare readily used but may not work on modern audiences easily (i.e. not being able to recognise someone easily when they wear a mask, veil or moustache!).The dialogue is very sparky as you'd expect and Branagh has done well to interpret the humour from the words on the page.  I think of the dialogue around the police officer.  Reading it from the page I never realised how much humour could be drawn form this characters scenes in terms of how the other characters view in.  Of course the praise of lies with Shakespeare but Branagh knows the Bard well.The cast is international and all-star (probably to a greater extent than it needed or deserved).  Branagh is pure wonder in the lead and really brings out the whimsy in many of his scenes.  Thompson too is wonderful and the two play off each other well.  The film lost a little when the two begin to woo, but it is still enjoyable.  Briers is excellent and Blessed is a bit hammy and underused (forcing big background laughs).  Reeves is OK in a small role &#150; the lack of significant dialogue helped him.  Washingon fits in very well, Leonard is good but straight.  Of the Hollywood stars I think Keaton  does the best.  When he is onscreen he is a little OTT but he is simply hilarious as the fool of the piece, and Ben Elton is an interesting sidekick.  Beckinsdale is good but again is not given much meat to work with outside of her perfect love for Claudio.Overall this is a very enjoyable version of the play.  Those who find Shakespeare difficult could do well to start here with something light and bubbly.  Those who enjoy Shakespeare will enjoy it as another version.  Only those who feel that the Bard should not be put onscreen for the masses (and there are some who think this way &#150; I have met them, they laughably call themselves purists &#150; elitists I think) will find fault here, because this clearly has mass appeal.

I admire his imagination and ingenuity, which he applies to his work. He created beautiful, picturesque, entertaining, amusing and hilarious movie with awesome actor's work and fine music. Some cuts of the original play were essential to make the movie dynamic, and the play was not considerably damaged. All members of the starring cast make Shakespearean text sound natural, alive and very funny. Emma Thompson shines as bright ginger-haired Beatrice. It goes without saying that she's an actress of unique talent, and in this film she does an amazing job, being lively, sharp and witty, sparkling with energy, humor and cheerfulness, or sometimes vehement and passionate (when her cousin is offended). Branagh as Benedick is up to her. Other notable performances are given by imposing Brian Blessed (seigneur Antonio) and Richard Briers (seigneur Leonato). Robert Sean Leonard and Kate Beckinsale as Claudio and Hero are adequate and beautiful pair. Keanu Reeves is really good in the part of grim, villainous Don John, notwithstanding opinions of many reviewers here.

He has such a small part, and I'm sure Branagh was fully aware of what he was doing when he cast wooden Reeves to play a wooden role. Reeves is indeed the one substandard thing about this film, but even so, it somehow works (Reeves' role, I mean). This film is about rapt joy and ebullient vitality, and Reeves' flatness creates precisely the contrast that makes his character stand out as totally unfit for the world presented in the film, just as the beginning of Richard III establishes Richard as unfit for *his* times (only, he had enough cunning and opportunity to really foul things up!). There is no mistake, neither on the Bard's nor Branagh's part, in casting Reeves as Don John.Having gotten that out of the way, I'd just like to say that this is my favorite Shakespeare film ever. It is perfect in virtually every way, and I think Branagh displays a marvelous and rare understanding of the textual material.

As for Emma Thompson; she gave a fantastically fiery performance as Beatrice of the untamed tongue; watching she and Brannagh go for each other in their satirical arguments was fantastic.  Then there was Kate Beckindsale; one who I really would not have expected in a film such as this, but she did an exemplary and satisfying job as the fair Hero; although put completely in the shade by Emma Thompson. Keanu Reeves, the film star who I reckon NOBODY would have expected in a film such as this was surprisingly very good as the schemingly dark Don Jon, he suited the hiss-hiss villain's role deliciously.

Director Kenneth Branagh, who also adapted the Shakespeare play, has assembled a talented gallery of British actors (along with a couple of American stars) who really gel together and bring the film to life. The result is a film with plenty of wit, chemistry and gusto.Opening in the sun-drenched fields of Messina (in reality, Tuscany, where the picture was filmed), a quiet prologue gives way to a stirring credits sequence as the Prince Don Pedro (Denzel Washington) and his men return from war, and Messina's Governor Leonato (Richard Briers) and his family prepare to greet them. This is the setting for a series of comical romantic shenanigans.The brave but naive soldier Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) immediately falls for Leonato's virtuous young daughter Hero (Kate Beckinsdale), and it takes a little matchmaking by the Prince in order to get them together. Elsewhere the Prince observes that the witty banter between his friend Benedick (Kenneth Branagh) and Beatrice (Emma Thompson) conceal a much deeper attraction, and he conspires with his friends to trick the pair into falling in love with each other. Skulking his way through all of this is Don John (Keanu Reeves), Don Pedro's illegitimate brother, whose bitter envy of Claudio leads him to sabotage the courtship between him and Hero...The original text of Much Ado contains a lot of poetic references to baldricks, toothaches and sheepskins. Branagh, in adapting the play, has thankfully clipped most of this out, though many of the play's better lines are still included. Only people who hate Shakespeare with a passion will fail to be enthralled by what is going on.The talented cast excel in their various roles. Branagh and Emma Thompson), still married when this film was made, have a spiky chemistry together as Beatrice and Benedick. Denzel Washington lends a quiet nobility and dignity to Don Pedro, while Richard Briers turns in his usual fine performance as the feisty but savvy Leonato.Kate Beckinsdale radiates innocence as the gentle Hero, although Robert Sean Leonard has a harder job as Claudio. He's fine being witty or enthusiastic, but is very awkward and forced when trying to portray anger or sorrow. Keanu Reeves, much mocked at the time for his lacklustre performance in Bram Stoker's Dracula, is surprisingly effective as the scheming Don John, and is a really hissable villain.The only actor who disappoints is Michael Keaton as Constable Dogberry, the policeman who instructs and supervises Leonato's night-time watch. Keaton unfortunately goes far too over-the-top and plays the constable as a demented drunkard. A more laid-back performance could have better accentuated the humour in the role. The whole film is framed within Patrick Doyle's rousing music score, which gives the film a lot of its spirit and atmosphere.All in all, a lighthearted and witty picture, and a fine example of a really good summer movie.

He wrote tragedies, romances, comedies and one of his best comedies/drama that's personally my favorite Much Ado About Nothing. Kenneth Branagh directs another wonderful Shakespeare movie about love, reputation and the battle of the sexes. His chemistry with then wife Emma Thompson was so wonderful that made the movie just a delight. You can't help but smile with Much Ado About Nothing, making you just love life and to remind yourself that sometimes the good guys do win.Don Pedro and his noblemen are visiting their good friend Leonato in Messina after having quashed the uprising led by Don John, the prince's bastard half-brother. Among the victors are Benedick, Leonato's niece, Beatrice, and Benedick's sworn brother Claudio, a young count. Claudio has been thinking fondly of Leonato's gentle and lovely daughter Hero since before he went to war, and returns to find her as attractive as ever. Don Pedro, learning of his young friend's feelings, arranges the match at a party. Despite Don John's best efforts to foil it, the Prince's plan works out perfectly in the end. Needing something to pass the time until the wedding day, Don Pedro decides to arrange a similar fate for Beatrice and Benedick. Of course, both parties being so stubborn to the opposite sex, this match will take a little more ingenuity. The night before the wedding, Borachio arranges to meet with Hero's gentlewoman Margaret at Hero's chamber window. John shows Claudio the rendezvous and makes them believe that they are seeing Hero in the act of infidelity. He breaks up the wedding and now it's a battle of the sexes and what damage you could do with a woman's reputation.Of course the questionable choice of having Keanu Reeves as Don John, as usual a wooden performance that I'm sure would make Shakespeare cringe. However, there was more than an exceptional choice with having Michael Keaton as Dogberry, he was too funny and exactly who I would picture for the role. Him freaking out because the prisoner kept taunting him and calling him names was just classic, he brings it up later while trying to charge them with lying about Hero got a good chuckle out of me. The thing I absolutely adore about Much Ado About Nothing is that it shows how easily a woman's reputation could be ruined. It's so sad to see how quickly Claudio turns on Hero when he mistakes that she's having an affair. We don't blame him as it was an evil trick but just tragic to watch as he disgraces her in front of everyone and they all look at her with judging eyes including her own father. Brought in with the proper balance of drama and comedy, Kenneth Branagh brought in a great cast and crew to make this play into a wonderful picture. I love Much Ado About Nothing, Shakespeare may not be for everyone, but in my opinion, he's still one of the greatest writers of all time.10/10 "},{"Title":"A Film about Everything that Makes Life Worth Living","Date":"21 July 2006","Score":"5 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Prior to Much Ado About Nothing most memorable cinematic Shakespeare adaptations were based upon his tragedies or histories. Thus we had Olivier's trilogy of Henry V, Richard III and Hamlet, Welles's Othello and Macbeth, Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet, Heston's Antony and Cleopatra (something of a rarity, but still worth seeing) and the Brando/Mason/Gielgud version of Julius Caesar. Shakespeare's comedies were less common in the cinema, probably because so much Shakespearean humour is based either upon puns and wordplay which worked better in Elizabethan English than they do in the modern language or upon topical references to the events of the 1590s and 1600s, lost upon today's audiences. There was that old Midsummer Night's Dream from the thirties and Derek Jarman's rather eccentric version of The Tempest, but generally the cinema took the view that the comedies were best left to the theatre and television.With his own version of Henry V, well-received by most critics when it came out in 1989, Kenneth Branagh inherited Olivier's role as Britain's leading cinematic Shakespearean. It was perhaps something of a gamble for him to choose a comedy as his second Shakespeare adaptation, but it was a gamble that paid off. The film was shot in a villa in the hills of Tuscany and in the beautiful, sunlit surrounding countryside. The costumes are vaguely nineteenth-century, but the clear intention was to set the story in a timeless, never-never land, a sort of rustic earthly paradise. (Those claiming supposed anachronisms as goofs, therefore, have rather missed the point. It does not matter whether they had piano-accordions in sixteenth-century Sicily, as this film is obviously not aiming at an accurate recreation of sixteenth-century Sicilian life).Just like the original paradise, this one contains a serpent in the shape of Don John, the evil brother of the Prince of Messina. What is technically the main plot of Shakespeare's play concerns Don John's spiteful machinations to frustrate the marriage of the young soldier Claudio to the beautiful Lady Hero by making false accusations of unchastity against her. I say technically because this storyline often has to take second place to the sub-plot about the wooing of Beatrice and Benedick. Benedick starts out as a confirmed bachelor and Beatrice an ardent proto-feminist, but (in a plot development which has been copied in thousands of romantic comedies ever since) they end up by falling in love with one another. Their verbal duels were so popular with audiences that at one time the play was better known as Beatrice and Benedick than by its official title.In the late eighties and early nineties Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thomson (Ken and Em) were the golden couple of the British acting profession. Like a number of other golden couples (Larry and Viv, Richard and Liz, Jude and Sadie), their relationship was eventually to end unhappily, but while they were together they were cast opposite one another in a number of productions, and it is they who take on the roles of the feuding pair. Both were practised Shakespearean actors, and they speak their lines with great clarity and simplicity, bringing out all the humour and drama in their parts. Richard Briers is equally good as Leonato, Hero's aged father. Hero herself, despite her central role in the drama, is, on the page, a rather colourless figure, but the lovely Kate Beckinsale, in her first major film role, makes her a delightful and unaffected heroine.Besides a number of leading British stage actors, Branagh also cast several Hollywood stars, doubtless with an eye to the American box office. He was criticised for this in Britain, but in my view, given the unreal, idealised world in which the film is set, the mixture of British and American accents does not matter. Nor does the fact that Messina has a black Duke with a Hawaiian brother, although all of his subjects are white.The most criticised of the American stars seems to have been Keanu Reeves. Although he is perhaps not the greatest speaker of blank verse, I must say in his defence that, psychologically, he seems just right for the role of Don John. Whereas the other characters are full of high spirits and good humour, he is a saturnine figure who seems to radiate gloom and ill-will, a man whose malice arises from his envy of the happiness of others. Of the others, Denzel Washington is appropriately dignified as Don Pedro. Robert Sean Leonard rather struggles with Claudio, but it is a thankless role, a man who is technically the romantic lead but whose jealousy and credulity make him a rather unsympathetic figure. The one actor I did not like was Michael Keaton who over-acts frantically in a weird accent as the drunken constable Dogberry, but even he did not spoil the film for me.A special mention must go to the wonderful theme music by Patrick Doyle, essentially a single theme which is heard, in a number of guises, throughout. (Figure-skating fans like me will always recall this as the music to which Tonya Harding skated at the 1994 Winter Olympics while under suspicion for the attack on Nancy Kerrigan; rumour had it that the choice of music from a film about a woman wrongly accused was a quite deliberate gesture to protest her innocence).This stirring theme fits the mood of the film perfectly. It is a film about love, laughter, happiness, friendship, sunlight and the beauty of nature- in short, a film about everything that makes life worth living. In my view, the greatest-ever film of a Shakespeare comedy. Perhaps the best-ever film of s Shakespeare play. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Branagh at his best","Date":"12 October 2005","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This is one of my all time favourite films - a classic feel good movie with all the humour and wit of Shakespeare blended with a star studded cast, lovely Italian scenery and directed by Kenneth Branagh.

I just really, really like this one -- warts and Keanu and all. I would venture to philosophize that the same is true for anyone's favorite film -- for your favorite. If you like it that much, it's not just in spite of its flaws but because of them. Much Ado is my No. 1 mainly because of the writing (hard to beat Shakespeare) and the acting of the leads (Branagh and the amazing Emma Thompson), but also because of some of the other performances are accidentally perfect. Keanu unwittingly nails his role as the brooding and soulless Don John. Denzel plays Don Pedro as though Don Pedro realizes he's in a movie adaptation of a play by Shakespeare, which seems just perfect to me.

Also Star Trek incorporates in it's episodes his timeless everlasting and universal plays. Branagh bridges the millennium. I feel great about to watch the happy and sunny scenery in a brilliant Tuscan countryside populated with exquisite actors. The opening comes with an landscape overlook taken from a painting and so is the whole movie. You can watch every single shot again and again and you will enjoy it like a precious painting. I love the music done by Patrick Doyle. You can see him play as Balthazar. Listening to his music makes me feel easy and happy again and the movie starts all over again in my mind. So I say thank you for the music and all the colors of life that you let me see and encounter! 10/10.

Wit doesn't age as well as Pathos, and whilst modern audiences can cope with Iambic Pentameter whilst caught up in the urgent, fatalistic drive of 'Othello' or 'MacBeth', they are less likely to follow the comedies, based upon confusion and complication, when both the exposition and the jokes are in archaic English. With the arguable exception of 'The Taming of the Shrew', the comedies have never caught on as subjects for film. Branagh may be a less daring director stylistically than his obvious antecedent, Olivier, but his choice of plays is riskier (Oh, alright, he also directed 'Henry V' and 'Hamlet', just as Olivier did, but let's credit him for range and acknowledging the legacy Olivier left film, rather than berate him for not being entirely iconoclastic).Crucial to the success of this film is its lightness, the open, airy feeling Branagh discovers in the Tuscan locations, and the infectious buoyancy that carries the film through from the opening. Casting Hollywood stars in Shakespeare has never been done more acutely. Denzel Washington's image in the early nineties was still most associated with characters of integrity and moral strength, and he certainly seems ideal for the compassionate but authoritarian Duke. He also brings a guardedness and toughness that makes the Duke a believable veteran, a playfulness that makes me wish Washington had a go at comedy more often, and, unexpectedly, a ruthlessness (watch his eyes) that indicates what a great bad guy he'd make (although we had to wait a while). Keanu Reeves, as the actual bad guy, has less to do than anyone else, and he seems a little uncomfortable at times, but this actually works for the socially awkward 'bastard John', and he finds the character's intensity in a way more obvious actors probably wouldn't (he always seems a little on edge). The much maligned Reeves is probably the single most critically mocked actor working today, but he always gives his best performances as repellent characters (see also 'The Gift'), although his endearing doofishness in the 'Bill and Ted' films and unexpected charm in 'Something's Gotta Give' suggests untapped range, and a much-wasted talent that doesn't deserve to calcify in action films (all that stony-faced action in the Matrix trilogy can't be good for an actor so frequently compared to balsa wood). 'Thumbsucker' bodes well.Robert Sean Leonard's casting borders on brilliant cruelty, his sunny superficiality exposing Claudio's fickleness and bad faith. There almost seems to be a void behind that perfect smile. A cherubic Kate Beckinsale makes a pleasant Hero, a little bland but ideal as Claudio's innocent other half (are her early-Hurley big eyebrows supposed to represent her lack of vanity, hinting at her integrity next to her flawless, feckless lover? Okay, maybe not). Richard Briers is excellent as her father, giving an elegant portrayal of a kind, generous man whose dignity is suddenly stripped away. Michael Keaton is one of those comedians whose talents are rarely unleashed full-strength on the big screen. His turn as Dogberry ranks, along with 'Beetlejuice', as his most uninhibited role. He plays Dogberry as a genuine lunatic, totally unpredictable and occasionally violent. He feels dangerous, in a way actors playing Shakespeare never really do. He doesn't seem too awed or respectful of the material, and as such brings it to life in a new way. It's one of the two genuinely great performances that make this film, for me, the best Shakespeare adaptation of the Nineties.The other is Emma Thompson's Beatrice. I haven't seen enough versions of this play to throw around terms like 'definitive', but this feels like a role fully explored, all the nuances drawn out, all the ambiguities taken into account. Obviously that's nonsense - Beatrice will continue to be played, and actresses and directors will continue to find new aspects to her, but there are so many facets to Thompson's that it's dizzying. Her verbal sparring with Branagh's Benedick is joyous, perfectly timed but revealing (look at the way in which, at the end of their first exchange, she delivers her parting shot to herself, almost under her breath. Thompson's choice, or Branagh's? Either way, it's a telling little moment). She finds the melancholy in the wit, particularly in her exchanges with Washinton's Duke (their discussion of marriage during the masquerade is beautiful, a little masterpiece in itself), and has such an ear for comic delivery and such an understanding of Shakespeare's language she reinvigorates a lot of the archaic wit (even the 'Seville/Civil' pun sort of works). And the moment when she tells Benedick what he can do to help her is a reminder that Shakespeare's comedies have real teeth, as does Thompson. This was (until 2001's almost unbearably acute 'Wit') her finest performance, unrecognised because, hey, it's Shakespeare, and a comedy at that, and the rest of the cast is so good. The well-made but rather staid 'Howard's End' won her an Oscar instead. As for Branagh's performance, it seems engagingly self-deprecating, considering his reputation for egotism. The preening but insecure Benedick is his most likable role, a far cry from the accusations of smugness thrown at 'Peter's Friends', or those of self-regard thrown at his 'Hamlet'. And I didn't mention the great use of the song 'Sigh not so', or the wonderfully daft 'heroes on horseback' moment at the beginning. I also didn't mention that with a bit of off-hand nudity at the beginning, Washington in uniform and Reeves with his shirt off, it's also cheerfully and innocently sexy in a way that Franco Zefirelli could never dream of. Rarely for a Shakespeare film, there's no sense of duty required to watch this.

From the beautiful Tuscany landscapes and wonderful music score to the great performances of Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson and Denzel Washington, this film's high energy and good spirits will effortlessly sweep you off your feet.   For close to an hour this movie can do no wrong and has some great visual and comedic moments.  It is around this time however, that we are unfortunately introduced to the character of the constable played by Michael Keaton.  His scenes in the middle third of the movie seem quite incongruous with the rest of the film.  Every word out of his mouth is virtually unintelligible.  To make things worse, his performance is so `Pythoneseque' and over-the-top that it actually feels like slow torture watching it.  Its as if Beetlejuice had suddenly invaded the movie.  Director Branagh's mistake was not in casting Keaton in the role, but in having him play the character as he did.The Film happily does rebound in its last twenty minutes and concludes in a moving and joyfully uplifting celebration that is extremely well choreographed.  This last sequence consists of one long, continuous tracking shot which is truly amazing.  The camera starts at ground level and weaves in and out of courtyards, buildings and dancing revelers to end up not only a good city block from where it started but what actually seems to be ten stories high looking down on the proceedings with a gods eye view.  It is a fantastic end to a flawed but extremely entertaining movie.  I recommend it to all lovers of not only Shakespeare, but of &#145;feel good' movies as well.  Had it not been for Keaton's sour note performance, I would have given the film an 8.  As it is, a 7 out of 10 will have to suffice.

It is full of colour and life, and left me with such a feeling of happiness afterwards, that it should be available to view on prescription! Denzel Washington has never looked more handsome than he does here as the Spanish Prince Don Pedro, Richard Briers as Hero's father Leonato and Brian Blessed as Leonato's brother Antonio are both wonderful in their roles, and Kate Beckinsale is sweet and lovely as Hero. It hardly needs to be said that Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are both note-perfect as the squabbling Benedick and Beatrice, making perfect use of Shakespeare's sharp and witty banter. It's worth mentioning Michael Keaton's small but important part as police constable Dogberry, which he certainly makes the most of, stealing most of the scenes he is in. The casting isn't perfect &#x96; Keanu Reeves is an odd choice for the villain Don John, who leads Claudio into mistakenly believing that Hero has been unfaithful, and Robert Sean Leonard is rather wooden as Claudio. However, there is so much to enjoy in this film that it hardly matters.Although it does contain dark themes &#x96; the aborted first wedding of Claudio and Hero is upsetting, particularly as the viewer knows that Hero has been slandered &#x96; it is mainly cheerful with a happy tone throughout. I'd recommend this to fans and non-fans of Shakespeare alike. It is definitely one of my favourite Shakespeare adaptations.

The ensemble cast make the film a wonderful viewing experience; Richard Briars, Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Robert Sean Leonard, Keanu Reeves, Emma Thompson, Imelda Staunton, Denzel Washington and Michael Keaton to name a few. It is filmed simply, as a costume drama, making the most of a country house and gardens in Messina, Sicily.The comedy is played up - especially brilliant by the greasy Keaton as the over-eager Constable Dogberry, Branagh and Thompson and the trick that is thought up by Denzel Washington's Prince. The older more seasoned actors are stunning in this - Branagh and Thompson speak their lines as if it were plain modern English and bring it alive, Washington - always brilliant - is beautifully cast. Much has been made of Reeves playing the evil Don John woodenly but his aggressive and solid dark performance is a great foil for the light fluffy acting of everyone else and he's got Shakespeare lead experience up to his ears. I felt the weak performance was Robert Sean Leonard, and his eagerness was a little cringeworthy but he still played well in the ensemble. It has song and dance, is exuberant and jubilant, sexy, romantic funny and above all fun. Any time I watch it I feel so happy afterwards, the finale of the big wedding and dance. Great viewing. And, any womens' knees are sure to tremble at Washington's line, Would you have me, lady? or all the men coming riding over the hill...Wonderful film, lovely story and great performances.

Leonardo and Beckinsdale (Claudio and Hero) cavort like young foals around Beatrice and Benedick's contrempts too quickly after Hero's revealed resurrection.It's interesting to consider that Branagh and Thompson were a bit more than halfway through their short marriage at the time that they played Benedick and Beatrice. They both excel in their roles --however, Branagh seems to outdo Thompson in the shift of emotion that takes place that turns these sworn, twin haters of marriage into lovebirds. Thompson seems to lose just a little in this transition. Watch for a bit of a hitch in the scene where she bids Benedick to go and kill Claudio. Benedick resists at first but then agrees as a concession to his new love for Beatrice. Thompson trudges away from Branagh just an instant of a second too soon in this exchange --and doesn't seem able to return any of the decisive governance of passion that Branagh exhibits.

He is well matched here with Emma Thompson. Both are excellent in the principle roles of Benedick(the Bard's spelling) and Beatrice. The supporting cast is outstanding.

Robert Sean Leonard is good but not quite up to the others as Claudio, and Kate Beckinsale is somewhat better as the slandered maiden named Hero. Michael Keaton is hilarious as the constable whose language is so filled with circumlocutions that no one can understand him.This Branagh Shakespearean production is considerably more edited for length than Hamlet or Henry V, with a run time of just under two hours, which is just about right for most movie audiences. The trimming is judiciously done and the play hangs together very well, with the main plot points largely intact. His direction is crisp and the staging is very good. The language is not too difficult to follow, despite the fact that it was not modernized. I found this film vastly entertaining and particularly enjoyed Denzel Washington in it. Locations are beautiful and costumes attractive. I found almost nothing to complain about by the end, despite doubting whether Keanu Reeves would hold up in his role. He is fine.

While I was previously familiar with the three plays on which those films were based, that wasn't the case with Much Ado About Nothing so I don't know what cuts, if any, Branagh made to the text. The play is enormous fun, extraordinarily witty and occasionally laugh out funny. However, it also features darker moments and a fascinating exploration of the nature of honour, particularly as regards Hero being publicly and, more importantly, unjustly shamed due to the machinations of Don John. As with Henry V, Kenneth Branagh excels as both an actor and a director. He is brilliant as Benedick, playing the role with an irresistible level of enthusiasm and charm. He directs the film with great style and flair and it looks absolutely beautiful as he used the gorgeous scenery of Sicily and Tuscany to its full potential. Branagh's then wife Emma Thompson is very bit his equal as Beatrice and their merry war is the best part of the film. The most important thing in a comedy based largely on wit and verbal jousting is the delivery of the lines. Branagh and Thompson deliver them as naturally as if they just entered their heads that very second. Overall, the film has a very strong supporting cast such as Richard Briers, BRIAN BLESSED, Robert Sean Leonard, Kate Beckinsale (who is wonderfully natural as Hero) and Denzel Washington (who I wouldn't have imagined as being much of a Shakespearean actor but he does very, very well as Don Pedro). It also features strong performances from actors in smaller roles such as Emma Thompson's mother Phyllida Law, Imelda Staunton, Richard Clifford and Jimmy Yuill. However, Branagh's usually superlative eye for casting let him down badly in the case of Keanu Reeves and Michael Keaton. As with Branagh and Thompson, Reeves' performance is effortlessly funny but, in his case, it wasn't meant to be. He delivers most of his lines in a monotone and just shouts the rest and not in a good, Shakespearean way. It was a bit embarrassing really. To be honest, I have never liked Reeves in any film that didn't have the words Bill & Ted in the title. Keaton is certainly better than Reeves, which admittedly isn't hard, but he was still way, way too over the top as Dogberry. His performance seemed to belong in a different film. I also don't see why either he or Branagh thought that it was a good idea for him to play the role in a bad Irish accent, which this Irishman found very irritating. I didn't smile once when Dogberry was on the screen - which I found hard to watch - while I laughed or at least grinned throughout the rest of the comedy scenes. However, it is quite funny to note that, since Christian Bale appeared in Henry V, both of Branagh's first two Shakespearean films featured Batman!Overall, this is a brilliant film which, like Henry V, demonstrates Branagh's mastery of Shakespeare but, because of Reeves and Keaton's poor performances, I can't quite give it full marks.9.5/10 "}{"Title":"Charming and effervescent Shakespeare adaptation","Date":"14 November 2014","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Kenneth Branagh's adaptation of Shakespeare's MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING is nothing short of astounding. With one exception, every cast member brought their A-game, resulting in a movie that is overflowing with emotion and humor.

The only downside is that Keanu Reeves is stuck in the thankless role of Don John, but fortunately the role isn't that substantial. Other aspects of the movie are just as impressive, from the on-location shooting in Tuscany to the score and a few beautiful songs. Shakespeare has rarely been so fun!

The best of all is the relationship between Branagh and Emma Thompson (then married in real life) as Benedick and Beatrice. As they showed in their brief time together in Branagh's Henry V the two are both magnificent at making Shakespeare feel human, spontaneous, modern and above all fun. Both create terrific characters &#x96; two bull headed intellectual wits who obviously belong together, but who managing to use their words and wit to keep tripping themselves up, like some Shakespearian version of the best of Tracy and Hepburn. The star studded cast all do good work, although the much lesser known Richard Biers is perhaps the most wonderful in his simple, warm human reality as Leonato. The film looks great, filmed on an estate in Tuscany with beautiful grounds and that Tuscan light forming a backdrop too our story. But, in the end, the play's the thing, and much of the other character's stories. well acted as they are, feel too melodramatic and heavy handed for the fun, light feel of the film (Robert Sean Leonard and Kate Beckensale both do excellent work as Claudio and Hero, but their storyline's over-dramatic swings are hard to overcome). The score also feels over-the-top, especially in the more dramatic sections, which in turn adds to the feeling that there's something too uneven in the tone. The comedy (e.g. Michael Keaton's very weird but entertaining Dogberry), is so broad, that it's hard to put it in the same film with the over- sober tone of the story of the young lovers. None-the-less there's a lot to like if one overlooks some unevenness in both story and presentation.

Which is a comedy that revolves around two relationships and finding love. One is the two older quick witted, fiery and experienced characters that doesn't admit to their feelings for one another. Because of pride and that tug and pull game. And the other is two love birds that blossom with attraction and romantic feelings for one another. And a villain that is trying to scheme and manipulate the situation. I personally thought this film actually did a good job of keeping up with the spirit and essence of the William Shakespeare's play. And all the actors and actresses did a good job. Especially Denzel Washington who owns his role with ease and without much forced effort. The young Kate Beckinsale is also in this and all I can say is, she looks better as she ages...For now at least. Personally I thought Keanu Reeves did a fine job playing the villain. Except maybe the part where he gives a villainous laugh. This is Shakespeare's play done well, and if your one of the audiences that enjoy Shakespeare's work.

For me, the biggest treat in this movie is basically any scene with Branagh and Thompson. Branagh IS Benedick, with all of his arrogance, bravado and chivalry. Thompson plays a beautiful and fiery Beatrice, and brings across the most believable portrayal I've seen of a Shakespeare heroine. Beckinsale and Leonard do a good job as Hero and Claudio. Although I know that Leonard gets some flak for his acting here, I think he brings across the impulsive and rash nature of his character well enough. Keaton and Washington are okay in their roles; I didn't find Keaton that distracting as Dogberry. Reeves could have done a little better in fleshing out his character--he's the reason for the 9/10 here.

This wonderfully light and wonderfully lit production of Much ado is a triumph,and an especial triumph for director/actor Mr Branagh who has been accused of taking himself much too seriously.In this movie he takes the text seriously but displays a previously unsuspected touch for slight self - mockery as Benedict who finds himself unaccountably falling in love against his will with Miss E.Thompson.She is pretty and witty and gay as Beatrice who matches him verbal thrust for verbal thrust,extracting the most from the crackling dialogue.A 16th century Germaine Greer without the dour feminist partyspeak. She is,quite simply,magnificent,and when Benedict jumps into the fountain out of the sheer joy of being with her,he transmits the heady,reckless, dangerous exhilaration of new love to the audience. With this production Mr Branagh has moved out from under the shadow of Laurence Olivier,a pall that has hung over him since Henry V,a fine movie in it's own right,but not perhaps the wisest choice for a young man wanting to make something his own.

It's bright and breezy, on the whole well-acted and the setting is just beautiful. Thompson and Branagh are perfectly cast and just light up the screen.I am rather biased seeing as this is my favourite Shakespeare play - with the possible exception of The Taming of the Shrew - and i find the romantic plot line sensational. The chemistry between Beatrice and Benedick is wonderful; sparks really fly off one another when each is still in 'hatred' zone and when they finally confess their love they really seem to mean it. This is helped by the fact that Branagh and Thompson were actually married at the time of filming so one could truly imagine that these actors were passionate about each other.I agreed with previous comments about Keanu Reeves' poor performance when first watching the film; he was rather wooden; but having seen other productions of this play i have realised that Don John is a shallow and bland character and therefore Keanu's attempt wasn't too appalling.Overall a great effort and i think that this is just one of those films i will re-watch constantly and never get bored.If you're a fan of this play i do recommend the BBC updated version of it from the 2005 ShakespeaRetold series, because although it is nowhere near the quality of the Branagh version, it does maintain the spirit of the original play and is a really enjoyable watch.

Even though this was at the beginning of his career, he sparkles as the witty lord of Padua who vows never to wed but changes his mind when he meets the one woman in all Italy who can match him epithet for epithet. Beatrice, played by Branagh's then-wife and actress in her own right Emma Thompson, is a sparkling counterpoint to Branagh. Their chemistry is utterly believable and Kenneth's look when he turns around and sees Beatrice coming onto the balcony makes me swoon every time. Their dialogue is at once hilarious, tender, and romantic, and their kisses absolutely sizzle, most particularly their kiss in the chapel as they dance around each other but finally realize that they love 'nothing in the world so well' as each other. They are quantifiably the true lovers in this story... they sizzle with suppressed passion all the way through. They are so mad about each other and clearly want to snog each other senseless but can't find the courage to do it, so they engage in a witty repartee to disguise this truest of loves. They are absolutely perfect for each other in every way. Benedick plays the witty man who cannot abide love, but he is also a man of honor, of kindness, and of fondness. Beatrice too covers herself up as a witty, lighthearted lady, but she loves her cousin deeply and is more than eager to revenge her cousin's honor. Thompson and Branagh take the meeting of soul mates to the ultimate level, far and away giving the best performances in the entire film. The archaic speech rolls easily off their tongues, conversational and impromptu, without any stiffness or uncertainty whatsoever.But others deserve mention as well. Denzel Washington is a quietly dignified Don Pedro, Keanu Reeves is a satisfyingly evil villain, Robert Sean Leonard has the ladies swooning as Claudio, and Kate Beckinsale makes a wide-eyed, innocent, and drop-dead gorgeous Hero. This is a movie you can watch and fall in love with again and again. Claudio and Hero exhibit typical Elizabethan-style love, while, as noted above, Beatrice and Benedick are altogether more sophisticated and deep in their relationship.Kenneth Branagh made this film a sparkling gem of a film, taking Shakespeare, as he has before and would again, to the height of art.

I saw him in the 2nd Harry Potter movie, and liked him as Lockhart. I knew of his fancy for making Shakespeare movies, but, honestly, had always scoffed at the idea of Shakespeare on film. And now, with this fun-loving movie, I have to say that I scoffed wrongly.Shakespeare's plays are somewhat confusing to the average American because we don't speak his language. While his work was probably very well-liked and popular in his time, people tend to shy away from it now, simply because they can't understand it completely. The truth is, it's really better to view one of his plays after you've studied it and can follow the action better. Because I had never read Much Ado About Nothing before, I found it a little hard to follow at the beginning, but Kenneth Branagh films so directly and his cast is so brilliant, that I picked up the pace and direction of the plot in no time.I say the cast is brilliant because only a brilliant cast could make Shakespeare's words sound natural. I've read somewhere that Laurence Olivier was a master at making Shakespeare roll off of his tongue- well, now we can add Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson to that elite list. They have so much fun in creating characters that hate marriage and the opposite sex, that it came to the point where I would start chuckling before one of them even said anything in anticipation of what they were going to say- everything they did was funny, so naturally I expected the next thing they did to be funny. Denzel Washington and Robert Sean Leonard are also very good, but not really given the chance to shine as much as Branagh and Thompson- that is, except in the scene where Washington and Sean Leonard conspire to mislead Branagh's character into believing that Thompson's loves him, the best scene in the movie. Keanu Reeves, who would probably seem better in a lesser cast, only manages to seem forced in everything he does as the villain.As for the other aspects of the film, I must say that the art direction is beautiful and that Kenneth Branagh is a wonderful director. There are spots in the film where Branagh makes much ado about nothing with the cinematography, but I'm afraid the joke is probably lost on a lot of the people who watch this- I only noticed it because my sister pointed it out to me.And as for the story, all I can say is that it's classic Shakespeare comedy. And, I suppose, that's not really a genre up for mass marketing. This movie won't be for everyone, but for those of you willing to watch Shakespeare and enjoy it, this is a gem. "}{"Title":"Full of high spirits","Date":"3 April 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" A prominent theme in the plays of William Shakespeare is that of the ambiguous or unjust accusation of infidelity. Proteus' treatment of Julia in Two Gentlemen of Verona, Angelo's of Mariana in Measure for Measure, and Bertram's of Helena in All's Well That Ends Well as just a few examples. It is a pervasive motif as well in Shakespeare's comedy Much Ado About Nothing, brought to the screen with exuberance in 1993 by Kenneth Branagh. Much Ado is the story of Claudio and Hero's excellent adventure thwarted by Don John, the sullen half brother of Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon. This Branagh adaptation is filled with gorgeous scenery, outstanding costumes, and an all-star cast that includes Denzel Washington, Emma Thompson, Keanu Reeves, Richard Briers, Robert Sean Leonard, Imelda Staunton, and Kate Beckinsale. The film is so full of high spirits that it successfully undercuts the darkness of the theme and renders it much ado about nothing.Set in a 14th-century Tuscan villa in the village of Messina, Sicily at the home of Signor Leonato, the local Governor, the film opens with Leonato (Briers), his niece Beatrice (Thompson) and daughter Hero (Beckinsale) welcoming soldiers returning from battle. Branagh creates a flurry of activity as everyone jumps naked into the pool to bathe in preparation for the occasion. The soldiers are old friends and there is an atmosphere of relaxed joy when they arrive. The returning contingent is led by Don Pedro of Aragon (Washington), Benedick (Branagh), a lord from Padua, Claudio (Leonard), a young lord from Florence, and Don John (Reeves), Pedro's half brother whom he defeated in battle. Upon his arrival, Claudio instantly falls in love with the radiant Hero (Beckinsale) and everyone joyfully prepares for the wedding, with Hero, as was customary for that day, accorded no say whatsoever in the matter.Two courtships take place in the story Claudio and Hero and Benedick and Beatrice. Shakespeare shifts back and forth between the stories of the two couples, interweaving them into a unified whole. Benedick and Beatrice pretend to dislike each other and exchange verbal thrusts and parries. Beatrice is exuberant, tantalizing, and full of wit, remarkably portrayed by the great Emma Thompson while Branagh, a confirmed bachelor, has a boyish charm and a keen intelligence. In spite of his outward disdain for Beatrice, Benedick inwardly burns with love for her and there is strong chemistry between the two (they were husband and wife at the time). It is interesting to note the similarities between Beatrice of Much Ado, Rosaline of Love's Labour's Lost, and Rosalind of As You Like It. All are witty, sharp-tongued women, reminiscent of the fiery Anne Vasavour, a woman of the court who was the lover of the Earl of Oxford and whose courtship offended the Queen and landed Oxford in the tower.As everyone looks forward to the wedding, the jealous Don John and his associate Borachio launch a scheme involving Hero's attendant Margaret (Imelda Staunton) to convince the susceptible Claudio that Hero was unfaithful to him on his wedding night. Rather than confronting Hero immediately, Claudio, supported by Don Pedro, cruelly waits for the wedding at which he interrupts the ceremony with a verbal tirade against his bride to be. He tells Leonato, ''Give not this rotten orange to your friend. . . . She knows the heat of a luxurious bed''. Her father, Leonato, takes Claudio at his word, believing Hero is a whore and despicably says that he would prefer his daughter were dead. The wedding scene causes Hero to faint and Benedick to challenge Claudio to a duel at the behest of Beatrice. To teach Claudio a lesson, Hero goes into hiding and everyone pretends that she has died.The theme of wrongful accusation of infidelity is a reminder of the cruel treatment by Oxford of his wife Anne, whom he also wrongly accused of infidelity and who was destroyed by his disbelief in her loyalty. If the play does represent a defense of his behavior, however, it is unconvincing as the accuser shows no remorse and never apologizes for his wanton behavior. As Benedick and Beatrice are manipulated by overheard conversations into believing the other is madly in love with them, Don John's scheme to thwart the marriage is uncovered by the dimwitted Constable Dogberry (Michael Keaton) and the play proceeds in typical Shakespearean fashion with justice and all good things prevailing. Much Ado About Nothing is rousing entertainment that cannot help but leave you in an upbeat mood.

I have recently studied Much Ado About Nothing, and I cannot see any major plot points which Branagh has missed that are needed at all. I believe the cast did brilliantly, especially Michaela Keaton in the role of Dogberry, and Ben Elton as Verges. They made me laugh every time they were on the screen, though Dogberry was quite confusing at first I admit! The character of Borachio was represented exactly how I would have imagined, including the rather English accent. The best casting though, I have to say, is Emma Thompson and Kenneth Branagh as Beatrice and Benedick. their scenes were acted excellently and the merry war amusing every time.

I am sure there are other writers out there like Ibsen, Chekhov, Pinter, and many others. This film adaptation is a splendid example of bringing American actors like Denzel Washington, Keanu Reeves, Michael Keaton, and Robert Sean Leonard to doing Shakespeare with Kenneth BRanagh, Richard Briers, Emma Thompson and her mother Phyllida Law, KAte Beckinsale, Brian Blessed. This film adaptation is quite lovely to look at in the first place. Everybody is happy and alive in FLorence, Italy. Phyllida and Emma looked tanned and quite happy there. At the time of the film, Emma and Kenneth were married and supposed to be the heirs to Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier. Sadly like them, they both split up after the movie. I suppose it has to do with Ken and Emma's egos or whatever. At that time, I guess we all wanted them to be madly in love. Two attractive and cerebral people like Ken and Emma get together. It was not meant to be I guess in real life. The film is worthy to watch because it's William Shakespeare being silly, witty, and comical rather than tragic and sad. I have to say Emma's mother, Phyllida Law, has become one of the busiest actresses of her age since the 1990s. She works more than her two daughters combined. I look at her and I can see her own talent. She comes quite alive and happy in this film version. Maybe Phyllida will get an O.B.E. someday before Emma. I hope so.

Then I saw the 70s film and the Leonardo Dicaprio film. And man oh man I wish my time with Shakespeare had started with this movie.Kenneth Branagh is priceless in his performance as Benedick, showing a true knack for comedy and establishing himself as one of the modern greats as Shakespeare. Emma Thompson delivers a cheeky and shrewd, yet caring performance as Beatrice. Micheal Keaton is pure genius with his slightly drunkard, slightly mad portrayal of Dogberry that pretty much sets the bar for funniest performance in a Shakespeare ever. Robert Sean Leonard plays a lovable and genuine pretty boy that is so uncertain of his good luck with the lady Hero that he looks for any excuse given to reject her.And here are the two follies of the movie. This has probably been said before, but whoever told Keanu Reeves that he should do Shakespeare, and a villain, no less, needs to meet bundles up in a bag of quick dry cement and sent down the river. He's just terrible. Don John is not Richard the Third. He's not Iago. He's not evil incarnate. He should not try to emanate the kind of wickedness he doe. It's bad enough that Keanu tries to give the villain a caliber that is not appropriate, but the fact that he does it so badly. He doesn't clarify most of lines, but we know they're evil because he glares during it all. The most genuine line of his (thankfully reduced) number of lines is I thank you. I am not of many words but I thank you. His performance is a good example of what future Don Johns (like myself) ought not to do.And the second problem is the serious miscasting of Denzel Warshington as Don Pedro. He was like Mr. Rogers through the whole play. Whether he got rejected, discovered his brother was a villain, he'd bounce back up like it was Christmas day. No one should be that happy go lucky. Did he have a Valium before each take? Never mind that he's black (although it does raise some simple logical questions, such as how Hero could've ever fallen for him pretending to be Claudio. Half brothers indeed.It's a slightly mixed bag, but the odds are in favor of the movie.

I only wish Branaugh & Thompson hadn't broken up, but as time goes on, it seems less and less important.It is amazing to think that this play was written so long ago and yet holds up so beautifully. Also incredible is the fact that the final shot of the cast singing Hey, Nonny, Nonny was done in one take.

I always looked forward to going to her class. If you're out there, Ms. McGowan....thanks. One of the plays we studied was Much Ado about Nothing. I was hooked by the sparing between Beatrice and Benedick. It was like a can you top this of insults between Joan Rivers and Don Rickles.I have been fortunate to see two stage presentation of this play and I think Kenneth Brannaugh's film adaptation holds up well against those stage presentations. Shakespeare's comedies are a bit hard to get into because of the Old English involved, but once you learn the language, just about any one of his comedies is better than the best modern sitcom.To give any one special praise in this movie is an exercise in futility because every one was fine. Of course, since Beatrice and Benedick are the main characters, the highlights of the movie are the ones were Brannaugh and Thompson are throwing insults at each other.If you like Shakespeare or good comedy....watch this one.

A wide variety of people help to give complexity to the roles, such as veterans Emma Thompson and Branagh playing the witty dueling would-be lovers Beatrice and Benedick, in contrast to the meddling Reeves as Don John. Michael Keaton asserts his character of Dogberry of the Watch and carries over a fragment of the ghost of Beetlejuice.True devotees of Shakespeare will revel in the Beatrice/Benedick story-within-the-story, but may cringe at Keanu's interpretation of Don John, as well as Denzel Washington portraying a dashing Don Pedro, eager to woo as well as curse the lady Hero.The upbeat tempo established by Thompson and Branagh takes away the sinister aspect of Keanu's character, and offers the viewer a happy ending, which we have come to expect out of the word 'comedy', but ultimately detracts from the underlying drama that Shakespeare was famous for.Those who are basically unfamiliar with the bard will at least delight in the scenery, the tone of the acting, and of course, the complexity of the courtier's political and romantic life.

Perhaps it was the dull study of the play, which seems a highlight of most Shakespeare courses, perhaps it stemmed from my fascination with Shakespeare's dramatic and historic works but my distaste for his comedic pieces.Perhaps it was because I never saw a good version of this play until this film came along. Now, I choose to watch it because there was little else on and I was confident that Branagh would give me SOMETHING to look at, even though I was not a Much Ado fan.And coming in, I found it quite dull, until Emma Thompson and Branagh squared off for the first time. Then I realized this was one of the most brilliant Shakespeare films yet created. Thompson and Branagh are completely ideal as opposites of one another. I found myself craving for them to be on screen when they were not, and I found myself caught up utterly in the film, even though I knew what the inevitable conclusion would be.And afterwards, I immedietly went and ordered the film. If you're a Shakespeare fan then, yes, it is -that- good. It is a perfect example of why Branagh's works are so incredibly enjoyable. Now, it is not the spectacular unabridged delight that is Branagh's Hamlet, but it has plenty to do and see. From Keanu Reeves as the villain Don John and Denzel Washington (a very WORTHY actor for Shakespeare) as Don Pedro to the aforementioned Branagh and Thompson, this cast is finely assembled.This is a film that I heartily recommend to anyone. If you've never seen a good production of Much Ado, or if you don't think you like Shakespeare much, I encourage you to watch this film. It may not change your mind, but boy is it ever a fun movie.

For negative examples, look no further than Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez. Great screen couples like Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall appear once in a blue moon. One such couple was Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, who starred together in such films as Henry V, Dead Again, and Much Ado About Nothing.It's often difficult to match Shakespeare's classic 16th century comedies with 20th century sensibilities, but Branagh pulls it off here. The only way to make this material funny to audiences is to take it way over the top, and that's where we go. Branagh, Thompson, and an eclectic cast of Americans and RSC regulars ham it up delightfully. Several Branagh regulars are on hand, such as Richard Briers, Jimmy Yuill, and Brian Blessed. Denzel Washington and Robert Sean Leonard acquit themselves well, while Keanu Reeves is somewhat one-note (but then, so is his character); Michael Keaton's bizarre Dogberry is difficult to judge. Kenneth and Emma are the real stars of this production, however, and they both shine.The film, shot in the Italian countryside, looks gorgeous, with wonderful sets and costumes, and the cinematography to show them off properly.This is a quality production, and it gives me hope that Branagh's film adaptation of As You Like It (with Blessed and Yuill returning) will be similarly successful.

His themes are universal, written so that no member of the audience - whatever his station - is left unrepresented.This is why I found not just the direction but the casting so delightful in this particular version of Much Ado. Though arguably set in its own era, the cast mirrors a contemporary diversity which is the heart and soul of any accessible version of the plays. Thus did Don Pedro command both a dignity and humor, remembering his station while revealing himself to be quite human (Wilt thou have me, Lady?). When he's present it's impossible to look away.Playing with social conceptions is another classic Shakespearian device, as demonstrated by the admirable casting of Don John. Again tall, noble, yet menacing to a look, few of words, and coiled for battle even when there seems none. The brothers look nothing alike, stressing John's Bastard state to make a point perhaps lost on a contemporary audience, and offer a relevance to his actions which to some may seem obscure.Those were the two I found most interesting. Of the leading four it's nearly impossible to single any out - they're as outstanding as I expected. Though perhaps special mention should go to Emma Thompson for rendering tongue twisting lines with the speed and ease of a native speaker. Most of the time in a movie like this I'm aware that people are acting. Never her - her lines seem so lite and free she seems almost born in the wrong era.Of all the modern versions of our timeless Bard, I think only Richard III (McKellen) fares better. This Much Ado is food for the soul and should be cherished.

If things fly too far of the mark, I can be very disgruntled. For instance, I saw a stage performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream where all the characters wore clothing from the 1940s. And there was a showing of As You Like It in which Orlando, the poetry-writing hero, affixes his love sonnets to trees by using Post-It notes. Ugh.Because of this pickiness, I was reluctant to watch a film version of Shakespeare. But my best friend insisted that I sit down and take in Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing. It's not the first time she was right, certainly won't be the last either -- because to say I loved this movie is no exaggeration.Most people already know the plot well enough that I can skip that explanation. Branagh and his then-wife, Emma Thompson, are radiantly cast as the bickering Benedick and Beatrice, and their on screen chemistry is enough to make one sorry that their marriage didn't work out. Nearly all the performances are up to snuff; Kate Beckinsale is believably emotional as the falsely accused Hero, Richard Briers is delightful as Hero's father, and practically every supporting actor adds to the overall enjoyment.Many other reviewers have commented on the suitability of Denzel Washington for a Shakespearean role. While, admittedly, he looks just slightly out of place in the film, I found no quarrel with his delicate and genteel handling of the worthy Prince of Aragon. Keanu Reeves has been much maligned for his wooden performance as the prince's bastard brother Don John, but I consider it bearable, if for no other reason than that he doesn't appear often. Michael Keaton is insane as the constable Dogberry, and the scenes in which he speaks are the most tedious for me -- but that has less to do with the acting than with the script itself, and he certainly does no harm.The only thing I really didn't enjoy about the film was the repetitious use of a rather irksome little song used only once in the original material. But Branagh's handling of the story impressed me enough that I rented his Hamlet.

My favourite scene is that of when he is in the garden over hearing the purpously loud conversation of the Prince and two other men (Claudio and Hero's father I think) which leads him to believe his enemy Beatrice is inlove with him. The reaction Brannagh shows to this is spot on, as is his character throughout the whole film. All the cast are magnificent and even though Keanu Reeves is so badly recieved by most of the audience, I think he deserves some credit as to at least trying to give his character an interesting turn as his evilness gives a good contrast against the other more light hearted characters.

Branagh doesn't call attention to it, but watch the final scene closely.

His tragedies and comedies set so many milestones in storytelling, and have continued to influence all creative mediums today, including film. The man obviously had an influence on Kenneth Branagh, the director of Much Ado About Nothing. This film is one of five Shakespeare film adaptations that Branagh has directed. It is about two lovers, Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard) and Hero (Kate Beckinsale) who are to be married in one week. To pass the time they devise a love trap for two of their family members. One is an arrogant and yet bumbling bachelor named Benedict (Kenneth Branagh) and the other is the strong willed and witty Beatrice (Emma Thompson). But in the midst of it all a man by the name of Don Jon (Keanu Reeves) conspires to stop the wedding. Overall the film is lighthearted, simple, and fun. However, it retains a much more sophisticated eloquence that definitely sets it apart from other films equally as lighthearted as it.When you're script is a word for word adaptation of the Shakespeare play, it is obvious you are going to have a fantastic story with great dialouge. There is just no denying that Shakespeare was a genius and comparatively had hardly any flaws in his work. The trick for a film adaptation of his play is to provide excellent visual aesthetics that will match the eloquence of the script. Branagh hits his mark excellently here. The film is something beautiful to look at. In every shot and every location it is obvious a lot of care and attention was put into making this film look as pretty as it sounds. The sets are beautifully designed, as well as the costumes which are all very consistent and fitting for the medieval time period. Branagh's direction is also top notch and he excels at being able to transform a script written for the stage into a very full on-screen experience. Branagh makes sure to put a lot of emphasis on the actors, since the characters are where the central focus of this story lies. But when he is not honing in on his actors he is utilizing fantastic tracking shots that show off the gorgeous sets and artistic design that went into them. The visual and audible aspects of this film thankfully lock together perfectly.As I said before there is a lot of emphasis on the actors in this film, and while the majority of the acting is well above par, there is a noticeable issue with it overall, but it is something almost out of the directors control. Shakespeare is not easy to act believably. The kind of acting necessary to make Shakespeare feel real as opposed to cheesy is in a league of its own. It has a lot to do with the dialect and style in which his work is written, which is obviously hundreds of years old and far different from how we speak today. It is because of this extremely specific acting style the actors must utilize to pull off these characters that we see a differentiation in the acting ability of the cast. In other words, we can tell who is a well versed Shakespearian actor and who is not. Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson are the shining stars of this film and it is very obvious that this style of acting is their field of expertise. It is a place where they feel comfortable and can truly act the part without forcing it in the Shakespearian dialect. Then we have other actors like Robert Sean Leonard and Denzel Washington who, despite being great in this film, are not actors of the same caliber when it comes to Shakespeare. I just couldn't believe Leonard and Washington as much as I did Branagh and Thompson, but it certainly doesn't mean they weren't very good in the film. And then of course at the bottom of the barrel we have Keanu Reeves who I won't even get started on. All I will say is that watching Reeves try to act Shakespeare is a painful experience.Much Ado About Nothing is definitely a very good film. It is very well made and, for the most part, very well acted. Watching a movie directly adapted from a Shakespeare play without removing any of the dialect of the time period is a breath of fresh air from your typical 21st century writing style. Now I will say on a more personal note that the story in Much Ado About Nothing, while very well written, is not exactly my cup of tea. Shakespeare only wrote in two genres... tragedy, and comedy. Much Ado About Nothing is one of the latter, so obviously it is very happy-go-lucky. My personal taste leans towards the darker tragedies that Shakespeare wrote, so I personally would recommend one of those before Much Ado About Nothing, but the film, for what it is, is still very good.

Director Kenneth Branagh managed to make an appealing film, without straying too far from the play. In fact, I think this is his best film as a director.The film itself looked beautiful, from start to finish. From the stunning beginning shots to the beautifully staged end scene, it was a joy. Also the music by Patrick Doyle was outstanding. The song's lyrics, performed by the composer, were actually written by Shakespeare, and the music perfectly matched the action.The casting was ingenious. The scene stealers were Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson(who looked beautiful in this movie)in their characters' love/hate relationship, that was so well-realised. Kate Beckinsale was the picture of innocence, youth and beauty, which reminded me strongly of Mia Sara in Legend. As for Keanu Reeves, I don't care for him particularly, but as you're supposed to hate his character, I actually didn't mind him here. Sterling support also from Richard Briers, Brian Blessed, Denzel Washington (blimey, he looked young) and Michael Keaten.The script was intelligent and funny. As a matter of fact, the script was the best element of the movie. It was also flawlessly expressed by the highly-accomplished ensemble of actors. In conclusion, a wonderful film, that is a must-see if you like Shakespeare. 10/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Mysterious Shakespeare at his most entertaining","Date":"27 August 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Shakespeare and his entangled love affairs are as famous as Dracula and his blood cult. But we recognize here the friar who advises a fake death to the girl and we remember that Romeo and Juliet came first in 1596. Shakespeare started with the tragedy around the clandestine marriage of the two heroes, and then moved on to a comedy that sounds at time very tragic, Much Ado About Nothing in 1598, and he doubles the merriment by having two weddings. And he will go on with As You Like It in 1600 and its four marriages under the auspices of the thrice crowned goddess Diana. And this was a model of perfection that he had kept from A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1594. But this present comedy could have been a drama at least if not a tragedy since the death being false, based on a false accusation what's more, could have led to a duel and one real death before being discovered as a fake, and it leads to the arrest of the villain who had arranged the fakery so that a happy love wedding was turned into a dramatic denunciation of the impurity of the bride. That's probably why he doubled the first line of action with a second that reminds us of The Taming of the Shrew (1593) and that second line will lead to the second marriage that will bring everyone, except the plotter, to merriment, gaiety and dancing. But this production is admirable because the setting of the play in a real garden and rich mansion in more or less renaissance clothing though it could be slightly more recent gives to the actors all the space they need to dance, play, hide, run, and many other things. The acting is admirable and they really make the language sing the way it should, sing joy as well as pain, sing sadness as well as happiness. Of course the language is also a little bit difficult but we get used to it very fast and we follow the music of it as well as the words, and the actors were directed into speaking as if they were singing, to the point of even having a failed attempt at real singing that sounds like a cat being disemboweled. And the final but suspended lack of clemency against the guilty plotter is there to remind us that everything may end with songs and dances, but there is always some drama to bring to an end sooner or later, and in that case outside the time limits of the play. But yet I always wonder about what such comedies, or tragedies like Romeo and Juliet, could look like in Shakespearean times when women were not allowed on the stage. So many girls played by teenagers must have been funny, with an echo in the play when Beatrice speaks of men with a beard or men without a beard and the latter are less of a man than she would ever like. That was said by a man without a beard in 1598. I guess we would find it funny and even maybe ridiculous today. But it should be attempted. Shakespeare played on the situation quite often with varying motivations.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines "},{"Title":"Be ye Blithe and Bonny","Date":"24 August 2007","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" Kenneth Branagh is one of the most powerful filmmakers out there when he is in his element. Much Ado makes that extremely clear. Here, Shakespeare leaves the dusty pages for a golden romp in the sunny Tuscan countryside.The story is exactly what it seems; a big to-do over nothing. Soldiers returning from war are hungry for love. Each believes he is climbing a mountain of obstacles to obtain said love, when in reality they had nothing to worry about the whole time. In many ways this is a parody of real romance; thinking the simplest things are the end of the world.The acting is mixed between superb and mediocre. Hero (Beckinsale) was flat. She only ever did what she was told, whether it was say this or fall in love with this fellow. She may not have had much to work with in the script, but there are plenty of ways to convey emotion without words. My problem with Claudio (Leonard) was not the acting but the character itself. He was seriously daft, believing everything he was told and then going ballistic. Even had Hero been unfaithful, to expose her in such a cruel fashion was completely unnecessary. I would have had a much harder time taking him back. Two standouts were of course, Beatrice (Thompson) and Benedick (Branagh). Each shows their command of Shakespearean language to the fullest extent, making every scene they are in come alive. Don Pedro (Washington) does what he does well enough. I never see him outside that certain benevolent hero role. Lots of people bash Keanu Reaves for his role as the villain and I can definitely see why, but I think that a flat, OTT performance suits the character. He even explicitly states that he cannot hide the fact that he is a plain-dealing villain. Dogberry (Keaton) was always a little hard for me to understand, however his ridiculous antics helped smooth-over the difficult parts.The cinematography is quite beautiful, and the very last scene is especially well done. Overall, it is a lovely film about the follies of love. "},{"Title":"Oh Keanu.

I love this movie; it has been my favorite since I was 10 years old. I am also a drama major, have been in numerous Shakespeare productions, and have cut Shakespeare plays myself for directing. I am writing a term paper on this movie. Kenneth did an unbelievable job at this movie. Yes, he did cut many, many lines as the woman before me stated, but he did so brilliantly. Watch the scene between Beatrice and Benedict at the beginning and you will realize that this movie kept everything juicy, nothing stale. Kenneth took certain lines (none to be spoiled here!) and gave them a completely new, fresh meaning that did not detract from the original intent! Branagh's casting list reads as a Who's talented in Hollywood and beyond, with his now ex-wife Emma Thompson playing deliciously opposite him as Beatrice; Robert Sean Leonard (who has since learned much about acting and is fantastic in the series House, MD.) and Kate Beckinsale as the sweet, if not too interesting Claudio and Hero; Denzel is princely as can be, I personally find objections against him to be petty, he knows how to do Shakespeare naturally, without pretensions behind the language. As Leonato and his brother are staples Richard Briers and Brian Blessed, both of whom Branagh uses in almost all if not every film he makes. The supporting cast was fantastic, Michael Keaton as Dogberry is one of the most perfect performances ever seen, and the only odd choice is, as stated before, Keanu. Dear god Keanu sucks. The lack of emotion in his voice, whether he is melancholy or not is appalling. You really wonder how this man was casted. Oh well, he really might be the only short-coming of the film, his scenes are almost unbearable.

The only difference is that when people modernize this play indirectly they don't make it nearly as good as this. The romance and evilness in this clash and come together to make the perfect love story between Count Claudio of Florence/Hero and Beatrice/Benedick while having Don John try and ruin everything. I found it interesting at points how clever Shakespeare was when he wrote this playwright. An example, how Beatrice and Benedick were tricked into falling in love. Did they love each other the whole time? It is up to the viewer. I would think that they would have loved each other the whole time but it is the cleverish ways like these that make the viewer think of questions like these. Also how Leonato can change, almost like he has two faces. At the first wedding after Don Pedro and Claudio said they saw her with another man he said mean things, pulled her by the hair and slapped her. It makes you think, could Leonato be thought of as a bad person even though he seems gentle and nice like his daughter? Even though this was a pretty good movie it had its weak points. The actor of Claudio, very poor. When he heard news of Hero dying he acted like nothing had happened that he was still waiting for the news. Denzel Washington was amazing as usual and Keanu Reeves did a decent job. Another weak point of this movie, it isn't really a weak point but in the eyes of a viewer today most people would think the beginning with the army returning to Messina, a little childish and corny. It could be considered this for the way people run down the hill, sudden bustling around the village and then you see horses coming toward Messina with music playing. It isn't terrible but just a little obscure and makes one possibly think about what people would do if this army weren't here for the amount of excitment shown. And of course the way Shakespeare rights this play, the passion he shows through the writing, the graceful ways of old english to the full extent in this playwright. There were also other points in this movie filled with more cleverness such as the banquet scene with Beatrice saying rude things to Benedick we he doesn't know she knows it is him. Common today but in this case and the time and place, very clever. No one can forget the scene where you are thinking Hero is dead and Claudio is about to marry her cousin and then under the veil low and behold is Hero as Claudio apologizes for not seeing that Margaret had been used to trick Claudio into thinking that Hero had done such a cruel thing. Overall I give it 8 stars, a pretty good movie from an amazing writer, more worthy than any other writer to this day and any other day. "},{"Title":"A brilliantly lit romp in the resplendent hillsides of a sun drenched Tuscany","Date":"7 December 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  Although Shakespeare's comedy is set in Sicily it was filmed, appropriately enough for this Anglo-American production, in Tuscany where large parts of it have been anglicised by the Chiantishire set.  As the Prince of Arragon and his noblemen return home from war, Hero is wooed by Claudio whilst her older cousin Beatrice seeks to renew her warring with Benedick, her equal in wit who in response to her enquiry But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me? declares what all reasonable people must feel when love takes over their reason Suffer love! A good epithet.  I do suffer love, indeed, for I love thee against my will.  Unseen just beneath the happy veneer of frivolity the bastard Don John has plans to seek revenge upon his brother the prince by spoiling the affair for his gullible friend. The roles of Beatrice and Benedick are here presented, if not originally plotted by Shakespeare, as the two key performances and how could they be anything other than with the remarkable Emma Thompson (`Sense and Sensibility') and Kenneth Branagh (`Henry V') bringing their dynamic energy to the parts.  Such is the direction and brilliance of these two that despite their dazzlingly white garments they have the unfortunate effect of casting the rest of the characters into the shade.Although plot devices from his earlier `Romeo & Juliet' and later `Othello' are used here, they are less satisfactorily developed than in the great tragedies. The one key issue I have with this play is with the fickle suitor being so easily forgiven by his former love after publicly humiliating her. I would have expected a more testing punishment from the Bard although he presumably decided to leave the original ancient Greek storyline alone, highlighting as it does the double standards of men and the traditional portrayal of meek acceptance by women.  His creation however of the razor sharp and independent minded Beatrice is an obvious exception to this who entreats Benedick to kill Claudio for the ill treatment of her cousin. The most telling point of Benedick's high regard for Beatrice comes when he takes her word that in her soul she believes her relation innocent, and upon this his mind is then set to act for her.The wisdom of the use of some of the American actors has been questioned but Branagh obviously had regard for his intended audience that is reflected in his eclectic casting.  The dude (Keanu Reeves) from `Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure' and the 'existentialist' hi-tech Matrix series is a witty choice when he exclaims he is a man of few words, although Don John's character does not possess Iago's full scale of villainy as Kenneth Branagh dastardly delineates in his own film version of `Othello'.  Last year's Oscar winning Denzel Washington reliably lends presence and credibility to his role of Don Pedro.  Michael Keaton as a ludicrously off-the-wall caricature Constable Dogberry ensures he at least gets noticed along with his sidekick Ben Elton, who borrows from his own infamous `Black Adder' series creation of Tony Robinson's Baldrick.Fortuitously the Royal Shakespeare Company toured last year with a marvellously funny staging of the play with the superb Harriet Walter as, in the words of the reviewer for the Independent, the dazzlingly attractive Beatrice, and Nicholas Le Provost (currently in `Foyle's War' on ITV1) her splendid verbal sparring partner.  Although Branagh's version gives a visual treat of the Tuscan landscape and some pretty actors it has to be said that, perhaps rightly and justly so, the RSC production out-acted, out-directed and out-classed the film with its fuller more polished company performance. With such stylish productions it is sad to hear of the latest RSC financial report showing a serious drop in revenues, an affliction affecting all forms of British art resulting from the reduction in tourists following the outrage of 9/11.  The resultant if startling initiative by the RSC is to turn to the video games market, with `The Tempest' fittingly to be the lead play to lend itself to the fantasy treatment. Also worth mentioning here and viewing if a copy can possibly be tracked down, is Stuart Burge's 1984 theatre-on-television version for the BBC with Cherie Lunghi and Robert Lindsay wonderfully cast in the lead roles.  Incidentally in June of last year Harriet Walter also contributed to the excellent new Faber series of `Actors on Shakespeare' with her illuminating and empathetic interpretation of the Macbeths' folie a deux (although regretfully a couple of decades too late for my own O'level script I would highly recommend it to any students of the text), as well as producing her own thoroughly instructive and entertaining thoughts on acting in `Other People's Shoes'.As a further point of interest the film's title lent itself to Michael Rubbo's 2001 Australian documentary `Much Ado About Something', shown on BBC4 this autumn, on an entertaining but not definitive examination of the age-old question of whether Christopher Marlowe was really behind Shakespeare's genius.  Also for the BBC, an ardent Michael Woods earlier gave an entertaining and well-presented counter argument. Whatever the truth, Shakespeare's body of work has had an undeniably profound impact on the spoken and written word and with the translation into eighty languages his influence reaches around the Globe.  Amongst its bewildering potpourri of a list compiled last year by the BBC of the Greatest Britons ever, he at least rightly featured in the top 5.This film certainly makes a do about something that is clearly a fundamental truth of the battle between the sexes.  A lot of noise and energy has gone into this production to ensure it remains something in the memory of the viewing public.  It is readily accessible Shakespeare and for that merit it ranks alongside Mel Gibson's `Hamlet' (directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1990 and at half the running time of Branagh's 1996 four-hour marathon) though it can be easily differentiated by more humour and a somewhat lower body count.

Coming back to it now, it has rotted in the can.I've just spent a few months watching the entire 37-play BBC Shakespeare cycle on DVD, and have seen a great many different ways of acting this kind of material. Congratulations here go to Emma Thompson, who is wonderfully true and real all the way through this film. Richard Briers and Denzel Washington also do fine jobs.It goes downhill from there. The negative reviews of Keanu Reeves are earned he struggles with the language, and never once sounds like the words he speaks convey anything from inside. They're laminated to his lips and emerge with difficulty. And Robert Sean Leonard is too darn wet for Claudio. It's impossible to believe that he has ever drawn a sword, let alone been in battle.Worst of all, Kenneth Branagh is cluttered, calculating and unspontaneous, and is an atrocious director of comedy. It's like he directs the first half of the play from an instruction book for those who have no humor but would like to learn, and makes sure the characters laugh too heartily at each other to cue the audience that it's all supposed to be funny. There is tiptoe-ing around among hedges, struggling with a balky lawn chair and splashing around in a fountain, and it's all dreary and inept. There is entirely too much exaggeration in the facial and vocal performances overall, and Michael Keaton and Ben Elton are grotesque without ever being entertaining as the clowns.Only with the catastrophic wedding scene does the film come to life, and from then on misses much of the power of the play. But at least they're not making those awful faces any more.It's like a bus load of English actors (with a few Americans thrown in) is let loose in a rented Italian villa to play charades. There's little that's honest and nothing organic about this whole project.Fortunately, the BBC studio version with Robert Lindsay and Cherie Lunghi is far more successful at the lights and shadows of the play, with less star power and no location shooting, but far more justice to Shakespeare's genius. That version is highly recommended, but not this one.

We generally are left gasping for air, or are bored to tears listening to wooden tongued actors laboring over words whose meanings they never seem to comprehend. If the actor fails in this, how can the listener be expected to understand? Shakespeare was not meant to be recited, but acted; and acted with full expression.Branagh gives us this full expression in his very accessible Much Ado About Nothing.Like few others, Branagh understands that Shakespeare wrote for the masses. He understands that the loftiness imposed upon the works is the doing of those who would keep us from our linguistic inheritance. Yes! The Bard wrote for us all, and Branagh, rebel that he is, scrapes off centuries of greasepaint to spread the jeweled words at our feet. Branagh is one of the few who realizes that we each deserve those jewels, by right of being human.This is not to say there are not problems with the production. There are a few, and mostly they stem from the choice in actors.Keanu Reeves is hopelessly miscast. The least said of him, the better. Denzel's skin color is not an issue with me, casting him is more proof of Branagh's outlaw brain. My issue with Washington is his too sedate delivery, though he finds his footing a bit better as the film progresses.Were Shakespeare to be secreted at a screening I think he would heartily approve of Michael Keating's performance as Dogberry. That character is the real comic relief in the piece and Keating's intimate understanding of the role gives him license to give Dogberry full expression. I suspect those who cannot let themselves enjoy the performance are trapped in the amber of the Bard's supposed loftiness.Robert Sean Leonard is just a bit dull, but then he is standing too near the blinding brightness of classically trained actors. He has real talent. I would have enjoyed seeing him play Puck in the 1999 filmed production of A Midsummer's Night Dream. The snippet from Dead Poet's Society is a fine indication of where he would have taken the part. If you compare Michael Hoffman's aforementioned movie, you will find further proof of Branagh's genius. (On Pucks... Mickey Rooney's chalk-board screeching Puck in 1935's version should be avoided at all costs. Tucci's too. Both show what is wrong with most filmed versions.)Richard Briers and Brian Blessed were born to be Shakespearean actors, and their common touch should set an example to all who would make Shakespeare accessible.  Alex Lowe, who played the messenger, should have a bright future on the stage.Branagh's mixture of Hollywood and classically trained thespians works to make this film one of the best Shakespeare adaptations ever!

I was floored. I laughed and cried, I got goosebumps all over and found a new film to add to my list of favorites. This is something special. Kenneth Branagh is just perfect as the eloquent Benedick, bringing out shades of heroism, humor, wit, romance and gaiety in his performance. Emma Thompson is hilarious from her first lines (God help the noble Claudio! If he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a thousand pound ere he be cured!) and she perfectly captures Beatrice wit and wisdom in her performance. She and Branagh have real chemistry, and the films most exhilarating scene is when she and Benedick admit that they love the other, and both give free reign to their emotion; Benedick by splashing through a fountain, and Beatrice by swinging like a little girl again.Kate Beckinsale and Robert Sean Leonard are quite good as fair Hero and the passionate Claudio, bringing a bit more life to the romance of the two. Claudio was properly gullible and hot-blooded, sentimental and quick to act, and Hero was gentle and modest, laughing at her cousin and obeying her father, a calming influence on her betrothed. I also enjoyed Denzel Washington's Don Pedro - he seemed always in control, honorable and solicitous of everyone, as the Prince should be. Richard Briers was also very good as Signoir Leonato, Hero's wise and gentle father. Michael Keaton was very funny - so over the top; I had never thought that much humor could be invested into the character of Dogberry, the constable, though sometimes I want to fast-forward his scenes and get back to our two couples. Very badly done was John the Bastard, played by Keanu Reeves as very wooden and one-note. He looks as if he is ready to stab someone in every scene, instead of being devious and calculating. The scenery is beautiful, and Patrick Doyle (who composed another one of my favorite films and scores, Sense and Sensibility) really outdid himself with the music. The best examples of this are the song Sigh No More, Ladies, the opening sequence, the fountain/swing scenes, and Hero's first wedding. A wonderful introduction to Shakespeare, and a truly enjoyable film for those long aquatinted with the Bard. Ere you watch anything else, see this truly excellent film!

Acting out Shakespeare well is already a hard task but actually directing, producing and as well writing the screenplay and playing a Shakespearean character is a tremendous feat; and the one doing all this, is Kenneth Branagh.   This film is amazing with its great acting, costumes, music and the beautiful gardens are a major plus as well.  Standing out from the rest of the other characters are the bickering, witty Benedick and Beatrice, marvellously acted by Kenneth Branagh and his then-wife, Emma Thompson. Denzel Washington plays Don Pedro, prince of Arragon and lord to Benedick and Claudio and Robert Sean Leonard plays the easily-lead Claudio, Kate Beckinsale plays the honest Hero and Michael Keaton is the bumbling constable, Dogsberry.  The only problem with the film is the lack of effort from Keanu Reeves' Don John, who is Don Pedro's half-brother. Shakespeare wanted Don John to be a sort of cold hearted villain, something like Hans Gruber from the movie, 'Die Hard', I can hardly hear a word from Don John, it sounds as if he's talking to himself rather than giving orders around to his henchmen, Borachio and Conrade, I don't blame Keanu Reeves' for trying, but this is definitely not a film you want to watch him in if you're a Keanu Reeves' fan.   The scenes played out in the film are touching, detailed and full of energy but one of my favourite scenes was when Benedick overhears Don Pedro, Leonato and Claudio that Beatrice loves him, which of course is a lie but of course Benedick doesn't know this but believes it anyway. (If you watch the film I guess you'll understand why.)    The music was lovely, composed by the celebrated composer Patrick Doyle, the two songs, one of them which I think is called, 'Hey nonny nonny' and the other was played at Hero's memorial service was memorable and I couldn't stop humming the tune 'Hey nonny nonny' for a few days after watching the film.   The last shot in the film where everyone is singing and dancing must be mentioned, it's a long continuous shot, without any editing or cutting and it's breathtaking, it weaves through the courtyard, and then looks up at the balconies and there's confetti falling all over the place, then we follow Benedick, Beatrice, Claudio and Hero into the gardens and the film finishes with a bird's eye view of everyone joining hands, dancing and singing. Spectacular.   This film is absolutely brilliant and I throughly reccommend it, hats off for Kenneth Branagh for this delightful and wonderfully romantic comedy, Shakespeare must be smiling somewhere...

I recently picked up a DVD of this Shakespeare adaptation because, let's face it, Shakespeare is great.  On the whole, I have liked all of the Shakespeare adaptations that Kenneth Branagh made that I have seen, and when I found this one on sale, I bought it immediately even though I had not yet seen it.  If Shakespeare is your bag, you need this in your collection.  I am submitting this review because I think two items are worthy of comment.Let's start with the bad news.  Keanu Reeves is disappointing.  Prince John is not a serious character.  Reeves plays him like he's Iago.  I've never managed to catch a live performance of this particular play, but I've always seen John as a caricature of an evildoer such as Snidely Whiplash or Dr. Evil.  I think Shakespeare would agree insofar as Prince John's main presence in the play consists of him describing his evil schemes and then disappearing until it's time for him to be caught and punished.  In my own humble opinion, he must be played as a comical villain if he is to have any entertainment value at all.  When Shakespeare wanted a complex, distressing villain (such as Iago), he took the time to flesh the villainy out for us.  Prince John is shallow and pointless except to cause the ado the play needs to progress.  I think it would have been nice to see Reeves portray Prince John as a character from the Bill & Ted movies.  Playing him seriously is a mistake.Now for the good news.  The other side of the coin is Michael Keaton playing the part of bumbling constable Dogberry.  My impression of Dogberry has always been of a clueless official along the lines of Colonel Klink or the Keystone Cops.  Keaton rearranged my thoughts.  His portrayal has Dogberry as being at least a little insane.  He no longer seems so much incompetent as existing in a slanted world that only he perceives.  It is a rare occurrence indeed for me to find that my own imagination is short of the mark, but in this case, that is exactly what happened.I do not know if the abovementioned items are the result of how the actors wanted to play their parts or Branagh directed the portrayals, so I will not attempt to affix blame or credit.  In the final analysis, it doesn't really matter.  The Prince John problem is insignificant because Shakespeare wisely chose not to give him too much stage time.  The Dogberry magnificence more than makes up for it.  Everything else is just fine.  Even the musical accompaniment is beautifully done, if rather anachronistic.Some may think that there are some casting problems such as Denzel Washington playing Don Pedro who, strictly speaking, shouldn't be black.  Even linguistic accents don't entirely match up.  So what?  Some imagination must be brought to bear in any Shakespeare production.  I am far more interested in the cumulative outcome.  In short, this film easily overcomes its problems.  Check it out.

Its lighthearted humor is easy to understand and made even more so by some brilliant comic performances in this film.  In fact, the casting in this film is nearly perfect.  I would only disagree somewhat with three of them  Denzel Washington, Robert Sean Leonard and Keanu Reeves.  Reeves's part is small enough and insignificant enough that Branagh got away with casting a big name who couldn't act, but Washington's part is just big enough to require a capable Shakespearian actor and he is apparently not quite there.  Meanwhile, Leonard seems to want to be a Shakesperian actor, but overplays his role to the extent as to be against what I believe is necessary (though it did add to the film's humor and thus may have been called for by director Branagh).  I love Denzel Washington, but here he just doesn't quite seem to fit his role.  The best performances are, as can be expected, from Michael Keaton, Kenneth Branagh, and Emma Thompson.  Thompson's portrayal is spot-on and Branagh manages to handle the subtlties of humor to the point where he appears Robin Williams-like, but the true genius is Keaton.  Keaton's character is given physical humor that could not have been written in the play and Keaton performs it perfectly.Overall, Branagh presents a beautiful setting, brilliant casting, a perfect adaptation of a brilliant piece of literature, excellent music, and some lighthearted original comedy (such as the folding chair Branagh has in the garden scene) as his film.  Therefore, it is a very brilliant and successful work for a reason.

He succeeded, since the film was obviously quite popular. Every character fell into a stereotype- the demure Hero, the gallant Claudio (I'm directing my own version of the play, and I make Claudio out to be a villain), the heinous Don John, played my Mr. Keanu Whoah!

The ending is a prototypical happy ending, leaving no loose ends, unlike other productions of the play which I have seen.      There are many good points about this movie. The casting was dynamic, and I especially liked the choice of Denzel Washington for the part of Don Pedro. It's good to see a talented African-American actor given such a challenging role, and Washington pulled it off to the best of his amazing ability. The costumes are elegant and simple, drawing more attention to the story itself. Finally, the film provides little or no confusion for the audience as to what is going on, especially when the Shakespearian text may be difficult to grasp.      As for the bad points, each character is very one-dimensional. Moreover, most of the actors excluding Branagh are a bit awkward with the Shakespearian text. Branagh tends to overact, giving the impression that he is way more into his production that the other actors are.     Overall, this is a trendy Shakespeare for Beginners film.

It was the first play of Shakespeare's I attended and this specific production was the first film version Shakespeare I experienced.  My friends and I, even though we were only eleven or twelve at the time, were inspired.  Inside our hearts a life-long love of Shakespeare began to grow.  This film makes Shakespeare accessible without changing or belittling it.  This film entertains and impresses without masquerading as something that it is not.  Above all of that, this film embodies its own unique vision (and, I feel, Shakespeare's as well).Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Robert Sean Leonard and the unbelievable Kenneth Branagh make this film.  The supporting cast is also excellent, but they could not be so without these fabulous actors.  Each movement, look and action fits the script so well you would think Shakespeare himself were the director.  The humor becomes as fresh and modern as anything else produced today, except that it has the timeless quality of truly wonderful entertainment.  Yes, the story is a little silly and contrived, but a little research into the Elizabethan period (or remembering the ridiculous things that went on in high school) convinced me of its possibility.  I have seen the film probably a hundred times now, and each time I catch new nuances in the performances, I find more fun in the word play and I rejoice in the comfort of watching something that is honestly worth every second.To be fair, there are several issues with the film I should address.  My only complaint would be Michael Keaton.  I, personally, could handle it if he toned down his act, but that's artistic freedom for you.  The major complaints I have heard from others about the film are that the landscape becomes one of the characters, distracting from the plot and Keanu Reeves is terrible.  I think, first, Tuscany is beautiful and there is little anyone could do about that.  This is the location specified in the script, and if it becomes another force in the play - so be it!  I thought the amazing sun-drenched hills only added to the effect of the movie and was not bothered at all.  The problem with Keanu (Don John), however, can not be pawned off so simply.  I hate to admit it, but it is true, he is awful beyond words.  (But isn't he always?  At least he doesn't get to say duh.)  I think the really issue is that that the character is sort of a cop out, no matter who is playing it.  Really, what is his motive for messing with everyone else's lives?  Who does he think he is?  Since Shakespeare had already constructed fabulously convincing villains when he wrote this play, I think that Don John is weak for a purpose.  Weak because MAAN is not supposed to be about deep motives, it is supposed to be entertaining!  The title itself refers not only to love, but also to theatre.  It is reminiscent of Theseus' line in A Midsummer's Night Dream The best in this kind are but shadows, and the worst no worse if imagination amend them.So, what are you doing reading this?

I just don't care for Americans in British roles (unless they can fake a passable accent). Denzel Washington was pretty good. Keanu Reeves was downright jerky (although he broods well). Shakesperean English simply doesn't sit well on his tongue. I can't say I cared for Robert Sean Leonard. He's a bit...whiny. I didn't care if he got Hero or not. I do strongly disagree with the comment about Michael Keaton, though. He really surprised me! He was *wonderful* as Dogberry!The English actors are entirely up to par, as usual. One thing, though. Kate Beckinsale is *perfect* as Hero. She is so apple-cheeked and earthy...just lovely! What on earth have they done to her since then?!? Now she looks like all the other underfed Hollywood starlets (although still beautiful, just not unique). Anyway, I still *definitely* recommend it.

He was the first (and almost the only) literary figure to portray real human beings in fiction. The problem with Branagh's production is that he loses almost every bit of the humanity in each of the characters.In the *real* Much Ado About Nothing, Don Pedro and Claudio are unforgivably dense, obtuse, and chauvinist; in this version, they are unilaterally forgiven by cast and audience, due to Branagh's meddling. Leonato is a similarly pompous jerk, but is pared down to innocence and sweetness for no good reason. And Don John is *not* just a hollow villain; if Reeves knew how to speak, we could see that he has plenty of motivation to be so evil.  It seems in this version that Branagh had no desire to allow the true characters to come through.He shaved away lines like Leonato's A victory is twice itself, Balthazar, when the acheiver brings home full numbers. This seems unimportant, but Leonato was just told that the people that *had* been killed in the war were few of any sort, and none of name. The acheiver definitely did not bring home full numbers. Get my point? For the sake of posterity and sunniness, Branagh strips away much of what makes these characters real people and not stock characters.Claudio, Hero, and Don Pedro (especially) are the major losers for Branagh's direction. The actors have had their parts shaven to the point where they have nothing to do but squirm and fidget in their non-roles. The only real people left in the cast are Benedick, Beatrice, and Borachio (of all people). This is because Branagh knows he would kill his own performance in doing this, and Emma Thompson and Borachio are experienced actors too smart to let Branagh chop their humanity away.Unfortunately, by whittling down Shakespeare's masterpiece of comedy, Branagh has left us with a sunny, boisterous jaunt with a handful of real and interesting people and a whole crowd of talented actors forced to go through the motions with boring, stock characters.  Shakespeare spent a lifetime creating fascinating people that actors can truly bring to life; it's unfortunate that Branagh didn't let his cast do that.

This actor is definitely Kenneth Branagh.  Whenever he is reciting Shakepeare, he makes it come to life, he makes us understand it, and he also adds his special charm to it to make it truly something of his own (a sort of collaboration between himself and Shakespeare).      I sat down to watch this movie having been told by several people how good it was, and it certainly lived up to my expectations.  I laughed all the way through this.  Every character was perfect for his part, every scene was done exactly as it should be done to best capture the effect of the language, and Branagh, as the director, added in many of his own terrific special touches (e.g. the chair scene in the garden).  Even Keanu Reeves, with his bad acting, somehow fit the angry, insular personality of Don Jon.  I also loved Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington ( remarkably majestic as Don Pedro, even though he is not a Shakespearean actor), and Michael Keaton, in a cute, but sadly overdone role.  I also liked the fact that the actors recited their lines with a charming normality; the Americans did not try to sound British.        This is a terrific movie to see when you are happy, and if you need cheering up, I am sure it would work quite well too.  If you are a Shakespeare fan, a Kenneth Branagh fan, or just enjoy witty movies, Much Ado About Nothing is one you cannot afford to miss! "},{"Title":"Mild and merry!

This film is still fresh and highly accessible, especially to younger American audiences (I've tested some of these on my teenage relatives) who might be turned off by the concept that Shakespeare means nothing more than some British theater company trying to educate the Colonials using ossified performances by theatrical statuary.I think Shakespeare plays should be inhabited by ordinary people who actually spoke a form of the English language that probably resembled its current American manifestations. After all, a lot of this country was settled by Scots-Irish immigrants, who brought an accent with them that still resembles what can be heard today in many parts of the British Isles. Not everyone over there speaks with that so-called Oxford accent.I loved the energy of this movie and was especially pleased by the performances of Denzel Washington and Keanu Reeves, both of whom seemed to me to fit their roles very well. However, I was very disconcerted by Michael Keaton, who really smothered his character, Dogberry the Constable. One important aspect about Dogberry is that he mangles the language in a way that foreshadows the much more famous Mrs. Malaprop of Richard B. Sheridan's 18th-century play The Rivals. In the film, alas, Mr. Keaton adopts a weird affect of gritting his teeth so tightly that his speech is almost unintelligible, thereby destroying the punchline of the extended linguistic joke that his character is supposed to be playing out. Mr. Branagh apparently didn't seem to mind this, but I do, and I discount the movie on this point.

Washington understands it as does Robert Sean Leonard - their performances are better modulated.

The editing and shot choices could have been better since there were long shots or many back and forth shots which made this film like a play full of talking more than a film, but that wasn't the main problem. I think I blame the source material and its adaptation in that it still feels too much like a play that makes its people laugh in springtime as if to remind us how happy we are supposed to be, but as a film it really drags - and when you watch the final wedding scene, you'll keep waiting and waiting for it to end (hence my gooey and annoying comment).I would recommend this film if you have trouble understanding the play since it is a confusing one, but if you are going to see it performed, why not watch a play?
