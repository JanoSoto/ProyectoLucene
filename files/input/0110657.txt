After all, part 3 didn't measure up to part 2, and this one doesn't have Daniel Sawn. Miyagi's humour wasn't quite as witty in this one as in part 3, but it was funny enough to make the movie worth watching.The girl's part was pretty good. She's a lost teenager who needs direction. I find the plot a little hard to believe. That the aunt would simply agree to leave her home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, a man she just met. Of course, he was a friend of her brother.I did appreciate the monastery. One might think from some of my other reviews that I wouldn't have liked the dancing monks, but I thought it was amusing. It showed that they know how to have some fun. Now if these were monks in ancient China dancing to pop-music, that would have been another matter.Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill a bug. Miyagi told her that street gangs killing each other is stupid, nations trying to destroy each other is stupid, but having respect for all life is not stupid. Miyagi has expressed such wisdom in the other films as well.I give this movie a 4 out of 10. Sure, there were some things I liked about it. It wasn't as funny as part three, and no character could ever live up to Sato in part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can't imagine watching it again, but it is worth seeing once.

The story behind the martial arts is about Julie (Swank) and her best friend, Angel, a bird with a broken wing. Most of the scenes with Angel are touching, and win points for the film. However, the villains are completely laughable and the story leads to times that are so unrealistic that you kind of feel pain for the paper the script has been written on.

He gets to know her granddaughter Julie, an angry teenager. She is full of pain about the death of her parents during an accident and has lots of problems with her grandmother and her fellow pupils. So Mr. Miyagi decides to teach her Karate to bring her back on the right wayRalph Machio's (Excuse the spelling) career had faltered at this point, aside from late hit with My Cousin Vinny, so he was no longer considered the bankable star he once was. A successful formula is repeated here, with this basically being a watered down remake of the first. Hillary Swank's star appeal had yet to be established here, but she certainly showed many flashes with her charismatic performance here. I enjoyed the relationship between Miyagi and Julie, it was genuine and a good attempt at reviving this series. What really hampered this movie was the generic storytelling of the villains. They had no depth to them, and they just felt like ordinary bad-guy foil for Julie and Miyagi to overcome. I liked some of the meditation scenes, I enjoyed Miyagi taking Julie see the monks, there was a lot more enjoyable stuff then 3.9 rating indicates. Training scenes could have been better developed, using a girl wasn't as effective as Daniel's, but hey, what can you do?Performances. Pat Morita carries this film with his presence and style. He deserved a better film, but at least he wasn't in a horrible one. He has good chemistry with Swank, and I believed in them both. You can't go wrong with the patented Miyagi. Hilary Swank is charming, and pretty cute to boot. She showed a lot of snippets here of her amazing talent that was to become. Lot of similar, successful traits that Daniel (Machio) had to make the character successful in the first three. Michael Ironside is a great villain, but is going through the motions here, and he has no depth to him. Chris Conrad is rather cheesy, and wooden as the love interest.Bottom line. Far from a successful film, but it definitely had a few moments that made me smile. Believe me; you can do a whole lot worse then The Next Karate Kid. 3.9?

We now know that then 19-year-old Hilary Swank later won an Oscar for her performance in BOYS DON'T CRY, and here she was already a beautiful young woman and a credible actress. As usual, Pat Morita is perfect as the gentle, stoic martial arts expert who always prefers avoiding a fight, but says, If you must fight, then win. (wink and smile).some SPOILERS follow, read at your considered discretion...Young Julie lost both parents in an accident and is mad at the world, her only connection seems to be an injured hawk that she cares for on the roof of the school building. Mr Miyagi was her grandfather's pal in the war, and offers to help young Julie cope with life and school. She gets expelled for two weeks on bogus grounds, but she and Miyagi use the time to visit monks and there she perfects her Karate skills.Back at school, she gets a prom date, Miyagi buys her a pretty dress, teaches her how to waltz, but the mean kids hassle them, leads to a showdown on the piers, they burn his car, Miyagi and Julie show up, she kicks the bad kid's butt, Miyagi subdues the teacher, martial arts instructor, and everyone lives happily thereafter.OK, it is greatly contrived. You can't become that good in two weeks at a monastery. Julie just too easily falls under the guidance of Mr Miyagi. The tough kids at school are too much of a cliche'. But the overall message is good, the need to find yourself, to look for the good in yourself and others, to respect all life, even the cockroach. Most of us like a story where the bad guys get put in their places. And the pretty but sad young girl becomes happy. Swank and Morita are a joy to watch, and I will watch it again.The DVD picture and sound are fine, nothing special. No meaningful extras.

It was too long and very predictable.Also,it offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence.The only good thing about this film was the performance of future Academy Award winner,Hilary Swank who made a breakout performance in it.And most of all,it was a little better than the second sequel as this film did not receive any Razzies nomination unlike the latter which got 5.In summary,inspite of the fact that the series tries to infuse a new blood with a new lead,the Karate Kid series has already lost steam and this time,it is evident to put a close into it.

The film does not work on any level and it's boring on every level. There's nothing interesting here and not even a lesson for anyone to hold on to.

You can compare it to the previous 3 karate kid films, or you can take it on it's own. The movie is not as horrible as everyone tries to say it is, but it does not live up to the quality of cinema that the other ones achieved. Hilary Swank's performance is pretty good, especially considering how young and inexperienced she was back then. Pat Moriati is of course great here, there was no doubt or debate about whether he would be good or not. The plot is so so, its not completely original, but it doesn't really fall completely flat. The plot is sweet/cute at times, and is empowering and uplifting at other times. If you are looking for a kinda clichéd, but pretty well acted, borderline sub par fourth installment, then this movie just may be for you. 5/10.

Basically Kesuke Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), once an Army Sergeant attends a commemoration for Japanese soldiers who fought in World War II for the US Army in Boston, and there he meets his commanding officer's widow Louisa Pierce (Constance Towers). She then introduces him to her bad tempered and bratty teenage granddaughter Julie Pierce (young Hilary Swank), who lives with the memory of her parents being killed in a car accident. This has caused friction between her and her grandmother, but also with her fellow school students, but she also passes time caring for an injured hawk she has named Angel, kept in the school roof pigeon coop. At school Julie meets and befriends young and kindhearted security guard Eric McGowen (Chris Conrad) who works in the fraternity known as the Alpha Elite, and she also gains an enemy in aggressive student Ned (Michael Cavalieri), both are taught by vicious mentor Colonel Dugan (Michael Ironside). She finds herself being horribly bullied by the nasty members of the Alpha Elite, and after revealing that she used to be taught karate to her new friend Mr. Miyagi, he agrees to teach her more moves to defend herself. She learns balance, be co-ordinated, awareness of incoming threat, and to have respect for all life, and she becomes friends with the monks that Mr. Miyagi has helping her. When she returns to school she knows that Angel, who was initially taken by Ned but returned, is able to fly, and they release her into the wild, and is then given a new prom dress from Mr. Miyagi. For some reason there the Alpha Elite are order by Colonel Dugan to bungee jump and enter, and when Julie leaves she and Eric share a kiss, but they also get caught up in a proposed fight on the docks. In the end, Mr. Miyagi is standing back to let Julie use her newfound karate skills to defend herself in the fight with Ned who is encouraged by Colonel Dugan, of course she wins. Also starring Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot and Walton Goggins as Charlie. It is nice to still have Morita returning for his most famous and once Oscar nominated character, and young double future Oscar winner Swank does alright as the new female karate kid, but the film is let down by the same old same old plot, nothing new to be seen really, not a original or highly interesting martial arts adventure.

I found that the bad guys are a little one dimensional, but this weakness is present in all the installments in varying degrees. The camera work is impressive and pans across some beautiful scenery from time to time. The Zen monastery is both austere and charming. The Zen monks add some humor and lightness to the narrative flow. I liked the Zen Bowling scenes which are a humorous counterpoint to the more serious Zen archery scene earlier on. The quality level of the movie is like a good TV series. The music chosen for the background is very good, especially with the Little River Band playing Listen to Your Heart.

Avildsen's The Karate Kid was a child's Rocky, a drama set amongst the intriguing world of karate/martial arts competition. (Not surprising, since Avildsen directed the latter film.) But it carried a non-violent message about it that was left behind in the messy sequels.1989 marked the end of the series. Well, at least for Ralph Macchio's Daniel. Now, there is Julie (Hilary Swank), a misguided and troubled teenaged girl who is left in the care of Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita), the legendary Wax on, wax off Chinese man from the previous installments. Now he is taking Julie under his wing and caring for her, much the same as she cares for a hawk named Angel that she has in a cage above the school she goes to.But soon trouble sparks in Julie's public life, which results in her being suspended from school for two weeks. This gives Mr. Miyagi and her some time to bond and reach a mutual respect for each other. Julie is taken to a Buddhist monastery, where she is taught to respect the religions and rules of others, to stray from violence when possible, and to enjoy and not mistreat life--including the lives of animals. *Yech. *I got the point of the first film. I'm starting to feel a bit of deja-vu. Some sequels are a continuation (The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2), and some are retreads (Police Academy sequels, Rocky sequels). This is a basic retread of the same ol' material used in the previous films. Whoever thought that rekindling the series was going to be profitable must have had a screw loose somewhere in their ego-inflated head. I mean, honestly, what's the point? Did the third film in the series really make that much extra money? I don't think so. But yet they thought this could work--and it doesn't. The big addition advertised here is that it's about a girl and not a boy. Well, flip me over and slap me sideways--this is seriously original and mind-blowing and worthy of two more sequels like the first film inspired!Not.The Next Karate Kid is nothing more than straight-to-video material, and yet it somehow made its way into theaters. It bombed, as far as I can tell, but it is starting to increase in video rentals due to the fact that a younger Hilary Swank (Insomnia) practically started her career here, before going on to win an Oscar for the 1999 film Boys Don't Cry. You wouldn't be able to tell that she is a good actress here. In fact, she's quite annoying. Her character says the dumbest things possible given the circumstance. (For example, she wakes up in the Buddhist monastery and runs outside, screaming for Mr. Miyagi, while meditating monks are disturbed. She finds Miyagi only to tell him that she heard a loud drum outside and wants to see if he'd like to do something today. Is she really playing a mentally-developed teenager, here?)The film has an odd charm about it, and irregardless of its flaws I found myself being strangely attached to the finished film's outcome...but then the warmness dissipated by the time the truly ridiculous ending revealed itself in full idiocricy. The villain of the film is the same type of non-motivated villain seen in Part III--he takes a vengeance against these young kids and treats them as if they have committed some disastrous offense in regards to him. Quite pathetic, really. And the conclusion (spoiler!), in which the bad guys create a circle of humans and Julie enters to fight one of the teens who has been taunting her throughout the movie, just appalled me. The Next Karate Kid carries one of the worst endings of all time in cinematic history. This is a series that did not need one sequel. This is a series that never needed three.

It almost seems like he forgot what his values were from the first movie.  Also, one must have a suspended disbelief when examining the monks.  The movie makes the monks appear to have a way too simplistic view of life, and doesn't really explain why they do what they do in the plot-line.  The villains are also a bit questionable, even though truly hateable bad guys.  I also have a suspicion about Martial Arts movies that end on prom night.So maybe this isn't a perfect movie.  So maybe this wouldn't be the greatest movie to rent on a Friday night.  However, in more ways than one, it's a guilty pleasure.  Hillary Swank is just so loveable, and the story, even though unoriginal, works.  In a genre of movies that seems to be based around nothing other than action and violence, this is a breath of fresh air.  Unlike all those Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, this is a movie about the spirit and the heart.  There are some people that need movies like this, and we'll take whatever we can get.

But the thing is that it got its own immortality by changing the form, the structure, the characters, environment, time..or whatever could make it new as well as amusing. So the shocking truth here is that there aren't new original meanings, there are only new original forms ! Hence when you make the same meaning in the same form once more.. That would be disgracefully shocking ! As someone wise said long time ago Repetition Is Hell !! But they loved hell in Hollywood ! As long as it brings them money ! like the situation which we have here  (The Next Karate Kid) it's part 4 from the very simple yet effective hit (The Karate Kid) so you knew so well from the very start that it's another Karate Kid, and another How to be a Karate Kid and it's the fourth one already !

And despite some great lines, nice moments, good acting.. It's FIRSTLY the repetition again, and SECONDLY the lower level too ! As (Hilary Swank) looked so unconvincing at the action parts, the direction messed some clever dialogue and scenes sometimes, and of course the foolish third act when the hard trainer gone crazy to blow up the boy's car, home, school, and city !! Sorry I got carried away !! But you know what ?! The producers may carry away as long as THAT can make the box office's millions ! They could treat it like they used to do all along by the very formula sometimes and by the very commercial thinking all the times ! So we would have  (The Next Karate Bully) where the bad rival opponent became the student and to stand with the good kid and his girl against the crazy trainer !, after that (The Next Karate Crazy Trainer) ! As that negative mentor became Miyagi's student so they can stand together against the evil of the city or whatever God knows what !, so it will be (The Karate Family), (The Karate Family 2  Full Throttle), (The Karate Family 3  The End Of The World) and so on  (The Karate Family In The Space  The Ultimate Conflict), (Miyagi vs. Yoda), (Miyagi vs. Miyagi), (Miyagi  The Beginning) as a prequel !, (Miyagi  Once Upon A time In The East) as further prequel !

Then again but in a TV production  (Miyagi's School) as the pilot for (The Karate Hero) ! Then the spin off (The Son Of Miyagi) !, so cinema presents (There Is Something About Miyagi) The parody ! And the indie Movie  (The Dark Face Of Miyagi) !, the graphic novel (Miyagi in Sin City) and the low budget pornographic movie (The Karate Potent) and the lousy sequel (Miyagi's Bed) ! Then the long soap opera (The Kid & The Beautiful), and the TV movie about all of that (Behind The Camera  The Karate Kid's Story) then some network will replay as a correction for all the flagrant mistakes of that movie in (The Karate Kid  The Real Events) ! To have the award winning documentary (Karate Kid's Saga) ! And some play (The Days Of The Wax) and the musical (Bring Back Miyagi) ! Some saturation.. while (Miyagi)'s TV early morning show.

Mr. Miyagi enters the scene quickly, as the grandmother decides to put him in charge of the young firebrand for a few weeks while she tends to his dwelling back in CA.  It turns out Miyagi taught the kid's grandfather karate, and you can easily guess what will happen next.  Given the new feminine spin, the film should have been better. The movie is completely predictable in plotting and all of the manufactured conflicts -- particularly the vendetta of evil disciplinarian Michael Ironside (this guy is allowed to work with kids in a school?) -- are ridiculous.  There is nothing offensive (aside from the general insipidity) about the flick, and children under ten will probably enjoy it.

But they really shouldn't have made The Next Karate Kid. This really was one big disapointment. Well the hell did they make this? Obviously, they only made it because they knew it'd make good money. Pat Morita should be ashamed of himself for making this horrible sequel. Surely he must've known that this ruined the original trilogy, which is why he probably has no career now (or at least a good one). And Hilary Swank is no match for Ralph Macchio. I figure if they were going to make a 4th Karate Kid, they should've made it about Daniel and Miyagi, not the annoying Julie! Oh well. At least I still have the fond memories of the originals and try to forget this horrible sequel.The story is that at a commemoration for Japanese soldiers fighting in the US Army during World War II, Miyagi (Pat Morita) meets the widow of his commanding officer. He gets to know her granddaugther Julie (HIlary Swank), an angry teenager who doesn't get along with anyone and is still upset about the death of her parents from an accident. Miyagi decides to teach her karate and help her out, both in school and life. And there's another karate gang that bully Julie and eventually they take it too far, so Julie and Miyagi have to do battle with them.The performances are fine, but this movie wasn't nessercary at all. It's a shame that this didn't continue the story of Daniel and Miyagi, but I guess that story didn't really have anywhere to go since Daniel was grown up by then (even if they did, he'd be more like a Karate Man and that'd probably be crap too), so they changed it to focus on Julie instead. Miyagi and Julie sort of mix together, but not in the way that Daniel and Miyagi did. I wouldn't say this is one of the worst movies ever (films like My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999) would be in that department), but it's far from being the best either.Rating 2/5  "},{"Title":"Are you kidding?!

Why?","Date":"16 April 2008","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Drama, Family","Review":" In 1984, The Karate Kid had some charm to it, even if it was little more than a poor man's Rocky. Alas, producer Jerry Weintraub failed to realize it was best to leave the story at the point where it had ended, and convinced Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to make an extra effort to turn the film into a trilogy. Part III was the definitive low in the franchise, yet someone must have thought the series still had some potential. What other explanation could there possibly be for the existence of The Next Karate Kid?Wait a minute. Next? Yep, Macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop eventually), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), playing a troubled teenager (what else?) named Julie Pierce. Now, the girl has family issues. She also gets in trouble at school. Said school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). As it turns out, though, one of his students is actually a nice guy, and Julie falls for him. This gets her in bigger trouble than before, of course. Lucky for her, she is currently living with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), an old friend of her grandfather who happens to know how to get back at the bad guys.All those factors ad up to seven clichés, and that's just a generic plot summary - imagine what the detailed scenes must be like! From beginning to end, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and dull marathon of idiotic lines and set-ups. Swank does, thankfully, have the likes of Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem this disaster, but why did Morita accept to come back? He may have received an Oscar nomination for the first movie, and was quite enjoyable in the sequels, but has nothing to speak for him here - even the revival of the wax on, wax off gag is stillborn. As for Ironside, he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but that's hardly a stretch.So, is this picture really that awful? Not exactly. There is one sequence that manages to achieve a weird beauty, but when the best bit in the whole film involves a group of Asian monks dancing as they hear pop music for the first time in their lives, it doesn't qualify as a recommendation to see the rest.

I felt he never did service to the role of the Karate Kid. I would have rather have seen Danny 'Ralph Mouth' Most in that role. Macchio turned out what proved to be the best movie in the series, and look where his career is now! Instead they put in a girl! They got Hillary Swank, best known for playing a variety of sheman parts in every movie she is in. I personally don't care for her buck teeth, but thats a personal preference. But still, look how Karate Kid 4 launched her career into orbit! She won a freakin Oscar. Jiminey Christmas! Meanwhile where is Ralphy?? He should put out some amateur porn tape like Screech or something.Anyways, my only disagreement with the movie is that they have a girl doing karate. As a self-proclaimed master of Karate, I have been the proud owner of a white belt for the last 8 5/8 years. The first thing they taught me is that there is no place in any of the martial arts for girls... well except for Judo... but thats kinda gay. So for the purposes of accuracy, I think they should have stuck with another male for this role. I was thinking perhaps Dennis Franz. He would give the role the depth it requires.Perhaps they will listen to my suggestions and make the proper adjustments in Karate Kid 5. Its too Pat Marita is no longer. I was thinking maybe Justin Guarini is the perfect replacement for the lovable Asian fellow Mr. Miyagi. He will give Wax on wax off a whole new meaning. HAHAHAHAHAHA funny huh? Anyways, if you are looking for an exciting movie filled with Karate and triumph of the human spirit, Karate Kid 4 is for you. Don't waste your time with 1-3. This is the Karate Kid for you! This is the Karate Kid for r the ages! "}]
