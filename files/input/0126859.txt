Is it the one moment of actually having sex, or is it a build up of smaller things through life that slowly take it away? This film has the effect of juxtaposing two views on the question with Adam & Eve, we have complete innocence up to the moment of having sex ..then they are thrust out into the modern adult world and expected to somehow automatically know how to survive in it. The discovery of Sex does not give you the automatic knowledge of how to deal with all its possible consequences. Interweaved with that, Figgis puts scenes from a man's developing life. Events shown that each eat away a little bit of innocence we may not have even realized we still have. The slow disintegration of Innocence through time. The effect of both instances is numbing. The most amazing scene for me involves two twins, unaware of each other's existence (both played by Saffron Burrows), who one day cross paths with each other in an airport. The set up is stunning. This scene begs the question if you met up with another version of yourself, a version with a different background & different formative events --would you even be recognizable to yourself? Would you be able to relate to that other you as a person? How much have the events in our lives formed us, and how much really is biological? The only quarrel with this film I have is a series of scenes in which Mr. Figgis employed a slow fade-in/fade-out method. This was very eye-painful to watch, the fade is at such a rate you feel as though you are just slow-blinking before falling asleep. Thankfully, this is only done briefly in the film. Over all, excellent filmmaking!

It is a challenge to watch and an even bigger challenge to decipher.  However, this film is such a demonstration of where film can go (beyond a linear storyline and literal constructions).  It is patient and relaxed in its pace, is free to navigate through time and place.  At first glance it appears to be a random compilation of shorts, but it really is a powerful interconnection of dreams, memories, archetypes, and life.  What is most admirable about this film, though, is its confidence in its imagery (some of which is extremely powerful) and its minimal dialogue.  This is not a film that spoon feeds theme and gives us chatterbox characters to walk us through what is happening. To be honest, I have seen the film three times and still am not sure about what is happening at every point, but it does leave room for personal meaning that makes it priceless and so rich. How many films can it be said of that even after a third viewing you have not even begun to realize its full meaning?  There is much more said in the silence of Loss of Sexual Innocence that is ever said in any of its verbose contemporaries.

To help set the scene for that comment, my favourite movie from 1998 may have been The Thin Red Line.  It seems that movies that I love generally split the audience into two groups.  Those that lose interest or are disgusted, and those that find these manifestations of the possibilities offered by film making exciting. I enjoy films that are told through cliche as much as the next person.  High production values, non-innovative camera work, predictable characterizations (even within complex plot lines) are fun.  But I also like to see the breadth of cinema challenged.  Occasionally, films are able to appeal to both the audiences that want familiar story telling methods, and those that want to be challenged.  It's great when that happens, but both the LoSI and the TRL have failed to do this for a significant portion of the audience (blue vs red America?).Some of the best parts of LoSI have to do with capturing moments that distill those things that we share.  For example, the fumbling teenage living room scene hit some parts of the give and take of early sexual experience perfectly.  A frustrated car ride captures family dyamics, and the everyday moments of getting along/by better than any other film I've seen.  A distant viewing of domesticity (including putting a child to bed and love making over chopped vegetables) through a window precisely underscore more cliches of everyday living that are cliches because they happen to us.  Perhaps because these scenes don't inform a simple story narrative, they fail to hold the interest of those looking for escape FROM life (again, as everyday lived).  But I'm not looking for that.  I'm looking for a celebration of identity, and those things that create it, and I am willing to work my way through what is, I think, essentially a character piece.  This movie does, I think, a very good job of giving us, in two hours, a short examination of the develpment of one character's sexuality.  How that development is a loss of sexual innocence, and how this loss ties  in to larger ideas in our society (adam and eve), is something that I have both an academic (reflective) and an aesthetic (less relfective) interest in.  As such, this movie appeals to me.It won't appeal to everyone.  I think that a good way to judge whether you should see this movie or not is if you _LOVED_ Saving Private Ryan and _HATED_ The Thin Red Line.  If so, do NOT see this movie.  If you liked both, or liked only the thin red line, you'll probably be more interested in watch LoSI.The audience probably splits similarly in regards to the Figgis Filmography.  Much of his early (mass market) work appeals to the first set (but not exclusively).  His later work, the second (exclusively).

This film was made before his other, more daring movie, Timecode in which he worked with a split screen in which the action could be seen happening at all times in all four sections. This film is also full of symbolism that will elude viewers. We don't think the director wanted to lose, no pun intended, the audience. The action in this film is seen through the eyes of Nic at different stages of his life. As the movie opens, he appears in the form of a child Nic and he makes another visit at the end of the movie, perhaps to watch our reaction. The child has intelligent eyes; he appears to be looking at our soul, or perhaps he is telling us this was his own story. The film that doesn't follow a linear narrative. Mr. Figgis composed the incidental music. He also includes well known piano pieces from composers like Beethoven and Chopin that plays well with the images on the screen. The real coup of the director was to employ Benoit Delhomme as the cinematographer of this droll story that follows Vic from childhood. Mr. Delhomme photographs the natural locations with such care that it might prove a distraction for the viewer.Some interesting actors were engaged to give life to this sophisticated look about the loss of innocence. This is a sensual movie that relies on the openness in which the director wanted to show. Julian Sands is Vic, the young boy of the story, now an adult and a film director. Saffron Burrows is seen in a double role; she is a ravishing woman! Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays Vic as a young man. Kelly MacDonald is seen as Susan. Hanne Klintoe and Femi Ogumbanjo are seen as Adam and Eve as they are placed on the garden of eden and when they are thrown out from it after having taste the forbidden fruit. John Cowey is Vic as a child in a non speaking but highly effective part. Rosie DePalma, a Spanish actress with an amazing face, is seen as a blind woman in a riveting scene.Like it or not, Mike Figgis is not a director to dismiss easily because he is an original.

Yes, this movie is all over the place. Confessed, I expected it to be that way when I decided to watch it. I would bear a non linear movie, and rather demented symbolism, if the theme is something that appeals to me, or better still - FITS the form of the movie. Sadly this did not. It's just art-cinema's answer to the hype around sex for pleasure nowadays. In a good movie, (just as with a good book) the theme should dominate the form. Sadly, the form was having epileptic fits here while the theme just sat there being generic and straightforward. This is rather like telling a story and structuring it like a poem. Why try to make the story of a (rather uninteresting, however handsome) man's sexual life up to his mid 40's subject to an artsy attack? The story (or the little that there IS) behind it is not deep, and not particularly meaningful, but the form (the way it's shot / the random scenes and flashbacks) didn't really help it to more seriosity and were hence, rather laughable. Triviality cloaked in 'artistry' really isn't down my street. If the theme would have been something very meaningful or complex or tragic, the form might have worked a little better (Why not give it an American Gothic touch, rather like McGrath or Brockden Brown in film version?) It would have raised the seriosity of the movie (and believe me... this movie is taking itself very seriously).I just cannot love a movie with such a trivial and generic theme (sex for pleasure) because it isn't really new or, as I said before, all too meaningful or deep in itself. Goes to show that you need a story that actually deserves to be wrapped in the cloak of stilted artistry.In its credit however, I will say that some of the camera work was stunning, and some visuals were quite breathtaking. I can't say I relate to the characters, but then with an artsy movie it's really hit or miss if you'll relate to them, since they must appeal to you personally to start off with, since they don't usually say much in their favor throughout the movie.Last but not least I'd like to say that even though I didn't particularly enjoy this movie doesn't mean that I don't enjoy art house movies. It's funny how people say if you didn't like this you can go watch some generic love comedy in the cinema... there's something in between too, you know! This isn't either ultra-artsy or generic to an extreme degree - there's some very good art-house flicks that realize that being alternative doesn't mean having to resort to obscure camera angles and a scattered plot.

It's not quite art, and it's not quite entertaining. The film is expressed in a series of vignettes concerning the sexual maturity of a character called Nic intertwined with other bits that are supposed to represent Adam and Eve and the beginnings of sexual discovery and other bits that either mean something or not.  The problem, though, is that the bits don't really add up to anything, not schematically, not thematically.  Every time the Nic character reappears at a different age, you don't even get a sense of it being the same person; it always feels like Figgis is starting from scratch all over again with a new set of players.       Figgis is a talented filmmaker, though. He knows how to build a segment for dramatic impact and how to compose a shot for effect, and in those rare moments, it feels like it's not all worthless and Figgis is getting across to the audience on some level.  The sketch of Nic and his family stopping at a roadside gas station is a good piece, as is the woman in the see-through cotton dress at the train stop.  There is an implied sexuality there, the sexuality that hums all around us, that we experience without really feeling.  That's when the movie scores, when it's not just another lame coming-of-age story.  But those moments are all too few.   On the other hand, the Adam and Eve bits are trite, and one scene where a man carries a shopping bag with a liquor bottle spout protruding (obviously a metaphor for the male penis) is kid stuff, junkyard symbolism at its worst.  Where this movie fails is not is in its structure on the screen, but in the mind.     One postscript After watching it, I put on the director's commentary on the DVD to get maybe a better understanding of what he was trying to do.  Figgis narrates with a not-exactly-arrogance but with a tone certainly descending from the mountain.  When he spoke the words we trucked in a load of red clay to recreate the Kenya of my youth, I knew I was done for.

His story ideas are hackneyed and cliche.He tries to tie together different times of a man's life, yet he uses a blond haired, big-headed kid as a young child; a fat brown haired kid as a pre-teen; and then a blond stick-thin man as an adult.  If you are going to show different stages of someone's life, especially not in sequence, you should at least have the actors bear some minimal resemblance to each other. Don't tell me this movie is sooo abstract that you can have totally physically differing looking actors playing the same person.  I can't fathom how or why they would do this.

Of course there are many superb movies about making movies, for example Sunset Boulevard and the '54 remake of A Star is Born, but these films have interesting stories to tell about, and by, people who have lived, and lived somewhere other than film school. Loss of Sexual Innocence does not. Normally I would applaud the freehand style the director uses in going back and forth between different times in the life of Julian, the main character, but some of his choices in doing so are confusing. When we first meet Julian he is a towheaded five-year-old living in Kenya; in his later youth scenes he appears as a dark-haired, obese teen, and as an adult he is rail-thin and prematurely gray. Morbid obesity is a deeply-affecting, emotionally scarring and virtually incurable condition (the cure rate is two percent, literally half the chance of leading an arguably normal life as has a heroin addict). The fact that Figgis, the author/director, simply wrote 100 pounds out of the story and reintroduced the character as a thin adult is a cold betrayal of the writer's lack of emotional depth or knowledge of the human condition. We're being told the life story of a character by a writer who doesn't know as much about life as we do. The changing hair color could be explained -- it really does happen to people -- but it hinders the audience who's trying to decide if these three actors are the same character, or if they are separate characters unknown to each other. Another issue that is not addressed throughout the film is, are we still in Kenya? If these nondescript urban and suburban scenes are in fact a foreign country by virtue of a caption at the bottom of the screen that says Kenya, then what is the point of setting the scenes in a faraway country?Eventually (but don't hold your breath) Julian's story vignettes, plus those of some other characters, converge in a single plot wherein they go off to some location to make their film, but the trip results in some very physical repercussions among both central and ancillary characters. Now that the film, at this point, has condescended to tell a traditional story, we never do find out if the injured people recover.I'm reminded of a couple of the later films of Joseph Losey (Dark Ceremony; The Go-Between), who teased us by meting out small bits of the story here and there and not telling us everything, apparently never realizing himself that he didn't have that much to say.One final observation The use of the word sexual in the title and the appearance of naked people on the poster artwork are apparently designed to draw crowds by implying, by virtue of the film's title somehow relating this story to sexuality, that the film is therefore sexy.Don't be fooled.

Mike Figgis has always been a pretentious and overreaching director and screenwriter. His past successes have largely been due to excellent source material and some genuine talent with regards to his technical ability as a director. When these items were combined with truly excellent performances, such as Cage and Shue in Leaving Las Vegas, Figgis' has managed to produce a legitimately good movie. None of the above is true for TLoSI.First off, Mike Figgis might think his life is interesting, and perhaps it is, but his own telling of his sex life is dreadfully boring. At least he certainly makes it out to be that way. Sex is almost always a great topic for a movie (even when you show absolutely nothing graphic) because it is such an integral component of the human condition. And yet, in this movie, with all its handsome players, it's mind numbingly dull and extremely anti-erotic.I think possibly the biggest problem that plagues this movie is Figgis' own inability to identify or empathize with other people. This is noticeable in his writing and direction in other movies, but in those cases it appears intentional and provided an unflinching look at disturbing subject matter. This movie actually seems to shed some distressing light on his earlier work as it appears that his detached style of storytelling is, in fact, a flaw. In scene after scene, we treated to imagery that is supposed to evoke emotional understanding, yet the scenes are comprised simply of clichéd approximations of legitimately provoking imagery. It is not unlike watching a sociopath feign remorse or guilt; they might say all the right things and perform all the right actions, but it still comes across hollow and insincere.Now, take all the above and combine it with editing that is full of self aggrandizing nonsense. Soaring music lingers over a minute of watching an Alitalia jet on approach.

Not that I blame most of the actors, who don't seem to really want to be there, for the depths this movie plummets to, but when there's only about ten minutes of dialogue, you need to do better than a vaguely disinterested performance to make something of a film. As it is, the performances mean that it's very difficult to draw any links between the characters, or anything at all that's going on. This reduces the film to a series of disconnected scenes and shots, which will leave most viewers wondering what exactly is supposed to be going on.I'm not even going to go into the pervasive nudity and the like, which has seemingly been added simply for the sake of having some pervasive nudity in the film. I'm no fundamentalist wowser, but if you're going to do things like that, please at least have a point to it.Essentially though, this film is pretentious art for the sake of making a pretentious art film.

Many people will just laugh this movie off as ridiculous, and I have to say, I can see their side of things.One thing I hate about some movies is the idea of a movie being artful because they want to be artful (artsy). It is a tragedy in many movies that could be great or at least good. If you want to make a point, if you want to make a film, just make the film. If it happens to be artsy, then fine, that was just how it turned out. If you inject artsyness just for the sake of it, you're weakening the movie to the point that it's nothing but artsy junk with no substance. This movie is certainly guilty of some of this.

Without reservations, I loved this film, but I also love a challenge for the mind and the senses. Maybe that is why The Loss of Sexual Innocence pressed all the right buttons for me.Like the 1983 film, Koyaanisqatsi, a Hopi Indian term for loss of harmony with the natural environment, this movie is also about losses, dysfunction, and mortality -- the separation of twins, loss of childhood innocence, marital indiscretion, loss of appreciation for basic human values, and the most primal loss of all, man's fall from paradise and separation from the divine.With such cosmic issues to explore, and without a coherent story or dialogue, the viewer is instead served up a smorgasbord of clues, flashbacks, mumbled words, surrealistic images, dream sequences, and the flotsam and jetsam of unfulfilled lives that are in chaos. Unlike more traditional cinema, the audience needs to pay attention, examine, process, and that rarest of all demands, think. Not everyone wants to make such efforts. In the preview screening that I attended, I counted seven people get up and leave during the first hour. Maybe they were puzzled by the abstract ideas, or perhaps just uncomfortable with the frontal nudity, frank sexuality, and universal emotions that ran like a fugue through the symbolism, accompanied by Mozart, Schumann, Beethoven, and other classical pieces on the sound track.I would urge anyone to see this movie with an open mind. It may not deliver the literal journey into the darkest reaches of the soul, as Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas, but it will expand your awareness of the human condition, and give you something to mull over for a long time.

Nothing in it struck me solidly until the surprise at the end where Adam and Eve exit the garden to paparazzi and news cameras.Endings are always problematic for experiments where the form is not well established, because so much depends on what we expect. This ending saved the whole project for me. Rugged. Completely transformed all that went before.That's because he treats the whole thing until that point as music starting with a pure theme, embellishing with variations in several parallel threads, then abruptly shifting from musical noodling to cinematic plunge. That plunge of us INTO the film at long last is his (and his archetypes) exit OUT OF the film into the unkind space that surrounds music.Some films are structured this way, where the entire film is merely preparation, setup, for the end.

There's a ridiculous horror movie called Nightmare Weekend, for example, that deserves a 1 for that exact reason. All three Scary Movies deserved a vote of 1, if even that high, even though they had clear plots. Those are in a curious group of movies that are so bad they deserve special recognition. With The Loss of Sexual Innocence, you have a movie that has no plot but whose style and philosophical depth gives it the right not to have one. It's a weird movie that is strung together like a lot of completely unrelated scenes one after the other, but it plays like a series of dreams that come together at the end and then meaning kind of hits you. It's notable that so much of the movie seems meaningless and random and yet at the end of the movie the message is so powerful that it's amazing that you hadn't caught on already.I don't pretend to understand everything that the movie is trying to say, but if nothing else the movie is stunningly photographed. Even the uncomfortable and ugly scenes are cleverly shot. Consider, for example, the various 'Scenes from Nature. All of them are very short and wordless and contain something like a naked person emerging from a still pond, walking up the bank, and looking around, but they are some of the most beautiful shots in the movie, and not just because of the nudity, obviously, since the nudity is total and yet none of the scenes are even remotely sexy. They clearly represent a time of total sexual innocence, since they are so clearly meant to signify some type of Adam and Eve scenario. In the third scene from nature, there is a black man and a white woman walking down to the still pond that the first two scenes from nature showed them emerging from, and after catching a fish and having no idea what to do with it, they marvel at their urination function and the differences between their bodies. From there we cut back to the present, where the rest of the movie takes place, and watch a series of people acting not nearly as sexually innocent as that man and woman were. A little more than halfway through the movie we see the woman wandering through the garden, I guess you could call it, and she comes across a statue of Jesus on the cross and then a rusted out automobile. She's fascinated by it, and then she goes around and starts eating things off of the trees which, if I know anything about the Garden of Eden, is some pretty reckless behavior. Ultimately she and the man eat off of the trees until they make themselves sick. When they wake up after being down with the sickness, their innocence has been lost, they see each other and the world differently than before, and they ultimately manage to get themselves kicked out of the Garden. The movie cuts back and forth between modern times and this sort of ancient Garden of Eden setting, interestingly showing innocence lost in both of them in a way in which they kind of meet up at the end, and one of the characters turns out to be the filmmaker making a documentary of it all along the way. There is a powerful scene near the end of the film in which the filmmaker and his crew are traveling across a desert and, after getting into an argument about an interesting thing that they hear on the radio, they hit and kill a young boy from a tribe of blue people who evidently live in the desert. The first thing that struck me about this scene is not that it showed how this filmmaker and his crew had long since lost their innocence, but how it turned out that they were not the only ones. The movie is not about how any certain people have lost their sexual innocence or any other kind of innocence, it's about how the entire human race has lost their innocence. Oh and here's some advice, watch the movie with the subtitles on, because it switches back and forth between various languages and is also recorded so quietly that many times you can't hear what people are saying even when they're speaking English.

This impressionist prism-movie about man's uncertain relationship to his body, and nature in general, is probably too lofty, too self-serious and too splintered in its storytelling to connect with a mass audience. But though the audience seemed split between titters and yawns, I find the movie improbably moving--and as obsessively, rambunctiously personal as a James Toback or an Abel Ferrara movie.A series of autobiographical fragments and symbolist fantasias, the movie takes as its metaphor eviction from Eden--and makes it radiate out in all directions, encompassing both the shame that adheres to human sexuality and the demolition of the earth's environment. There's obviously something moss-headed in the notion that sex was once, Blue Lagoon-like, free and pure, and is now polluted by human neuroses and power plays. Where does Figgis think human neuroses and power plays came from--an alien hovercraft? But the kaleidoscope Figgis generates around this material is intoxicating and sometimes shockingly poignant--as with a moment when two supermodelly twins, separated at birth, chance upon one another in the Rome airport. It's like a lost moment from a late Fellini movie (but sweeter, and with humility).

Suffice it to say that many filmmakers were highly resistant to the idea of even using sound when the technology first became available. Charlie Chaplin was initially profoundly opposed until he realized that sound effects could help him advance the plot (it was this, rather than the usefulness of dialogue, that moved him into the sound camp). Mike Figgis is a brave man. He used the currency earned by the highly admired Leaving Las Vegas to make a bold little film that returns us to the very roots of cinema by letting his pictures tell the story instead of spelling it all out in dialogue.

This movie was absolutely stunning.   The photography and music were breath-taking, and I enjoyed its Adam and Eve sequences, which have proved to be unpopular with the majority of the public.  The scene in which Adam and Eve get photographed and exploited by the paparazzi was a little bit much, but only a little. Also, the Twins (both played by Saffron Burrows) sequence was the most beautiful in the movie, particularly when both women meet eye to eye. That scene is what I remember the most about this movie. The fact that Mike Figgis created an international movie with sparse dialogue is really amazing.  It was like watching a contemporary silent film and Figgis allows the viewer to fill in the blanks.  I can't say that I understood the movie completely (I saw it more than 6 months ago and can't remember everything), but I felt very absorbed into it. It just astounds me how so many people criticize this movie as being pretentious.  It may have been self-consciously arty at times, but so what?  The films of Stanley Kubrick could be justifiably labeled the same way, yet we hail him as one of the best filmmakers of all time.I recommend The Loss of Sexual Innocence to everyone.

This film places FILM back in the world of art and out of the world of business.  If you don't like art and have to have dialogue and serious (or not so serious) structure then do not see this film.  But if you love the mysterious and intriguing, if you enjoy Bunuel, Cocteau then this film is for you.  Some says it does not contain anything, it simply contains more then those can see.  The film speaks volumes about the condition of man.  Praises be to anyone who can make a film such as this in the face of adversity.

It strikes me as an experiment that has and will cause some viewers to think things that Figgis might not be happy to hear about. His film Liebestraum is one of my favorites, but he might find my interpretations of that one quite odd. So what I have here are a list of ideas which I think are suggested by parts of the film. As one reviewer here said, this is not a film about sex. The sex and the title are there to drag people in and to keep some of them watching. Parts of the film are certainly straightforward enough as in the case of little Figgis being treated horribly in a modern 'civilized' school gymnasium setting. The description of primitive people and how they trained (or still train..) their children to be killers and cannibals when it comes to members of other tribes that comes before the school sequence certainly tells you what's going on. Civilization hasn't come very far. However, apologists for both the cannibal tribe and the 'war on obesity'might have to think the 'apologies' over. (unless they are hopeless) When it comes to animals..the human one is one of the really low ones, especially when it's part of a group or a tribe. Of course the scenes with the characters most reviewers call Adam and Eve do in the end suggest South Africa during the apartheid period. The police and guns and dogs. The twins..are an easy part. However, not all twins are happy to be twins. (And certain cultures view twins in very vicious tribal ways..) The sequence in the desert could give a viewer something to think about when someone comes around asking for donations for starving desert tribes who wear turbans and paint themselves blue. The tribe kills the woman, one of the twins,because she offered to stay behind while the others involved in the 'accident' drove to notify the police. A child who should not have been running alone in the desert was killed by the reckless driving of a western man incapable of much thought. He's no better than the jerks who laugh at the incident involving the blind woman's seeing eye dog earlier in the film. There too the twin tries to help and is hit at by the blind woman trying to fend off the dogs in heat and maybe their counterparts. The twin is innocent but the members of the tribe think in numbers. They are incapable of any of the nuances human beings should after all this time be capable of. The reckless driver gets off free and is happy to leave the woman behind. Her boyfriend is a little upset. Of course we don't know who played the tribe in the desert... It's a nicely cynical piece of work. Sex is the least interesting thing in the movie.

Deliberate, careful pace. Reactive. Hated or Loved. Transcendental.Not everyone will like this film. I'll venture further to say a lot of people will not like it. That doesn't mean you shouldn't give it a chance. If you like to look at beautiful art in a museum, everything from modern art to the more traditional painterly forms, see this film. If Miles Davis' Bitches Brew speaks to you, you have the capacity to enjoy this film. If you like films that highly affect you, see this one. However, if you are looking for something with a plain, spoon-fed storyline and theme, this is not for you. Or if you don't want to think (you just want to be numbly entertained), go see something else. But to dismiss it for any other reason or to walk out of it before it is over, is a travesty. Give it the benefit of the doubt. Let it say its piece. Like all great works of art, you have to look at it as a whole.The Loss of Sexual Innocence is a bold-faced rebellion against the way people normally appreciate films. It challenges you to feel deeply and search for meanings, just as we do in everyday life; just as it is our nature to do. This film is what you get from it. It is how you see it and interpret it. One person looks at a Velazquez painting and sees an old woman cooking. Another person looks at the same painting and sees the realism of the two fish on the plate and the translucent quality of the raw egg in the soup. And yet another person sees or feels the emotion on the woman's face, empathizing with her. Figgis' film has that capacity. Look at it with those kind of eyes; open-minded. Go with the feelings that it stirs up in you, whatever they may be. Search these feelings out, even after the film is over. A strong reaction from the see-er is the true artist's goal.It is exciting to have a film like this from Mike Figgis. After his more mainstream and widely accepted Leaving Las Vegas, this is a healthy validation for him. The Loss... is masterfully crafted. Every detail and brush-stroke is intentional and utterly important. It plays like a symphony to the senses with both visual and 'audial' recapitulations and cadences; an experience that stays with you.

Apparently Ms. Klintoe has not appeared in any other film, or at least, has no record of filmography. Wish I knew if she is in any other film. Incidentally, Saffron Burrows, who is murdered in this film also appears in the very fine film entitled Enigma. A spy story about encoding messages during the 2nd world war. Enigma, like this film has many twists and turns to the plot and also enjoys some of the finest British actors of record. I enjoyed this film and posses a copy of the same.

Apparently these folks would rather be watching some tripe like Meet the Parents or The Thomas Crown Affair. Most enjoyable was FrannyZooey's condemnation of TLOSI as something that would be embarrassing as a collegiate effort (but perhaps not quite as embarrassing as taking one's handle from a de rigueur collegiate text?). FrannyZooey goes on to condemn TLOSI as being both hackneyed and cliché. Both? He, he, he, and perhaps it's also too complex and intricate? Too beautiful and attractive? Perhaps Franny just learned what hackneyed and cliché meant and wanted to use them both in the same sentence...twice...?The fact of the matter is that The Loss of Sexual Innocence represents inspired film making in its story, cinematography and scoring. How often does one get to a film as well built as this one? Maybe once a year if you see a lot of independent films and happen to be very lucky.Can't stand a storyline that doesn't spell out every twist and turn for you? you'd better rent Meet the Parents. Need the score to tell you how to feel every minute? Better find a movie with John Williams at emo control. Hate beautiful cinematography? There are plenty of films uglier than this one. Want to see sex used to sell tickets? Well, you can see that at any multiplex any day of the week. Want to see a well constructed film? Watch The Loss of Sexual Innocence - and only if you're really lucky you'll have seen another film as creative this one in the last year...

We follow the life from young boy to man of Nic and his experiences that one by one moves him further from his own Garden of Eden innocence.  Spliced into this story is a telling of Adam and Eve (for those that didn't get the point of the title).  It is by far the most beautifully shot segment, though not very subtle or original for that matter.  There is also a third story line (you get the idea that maybe the writer learned how to tell a story by watching Fantasy Island or Love Boat?  Three Three Three stories for the price of one!  Too bad they couldn't get John Ritter and Charro to play Adam and Eve.)  The third story is about twins separated at birth who see each other years later in an airport.  No longer unique, the twins face a...you got it...loss of innocence.  These stories are complicated by flashbacks and dream sequences.  Like a book of sketches where one might make a nice painting someday, this film is not ready for public consumption, but interesting none the less.

When I first read this I was questioned it mainly because I didn't think it was a very good film and there actually was plot devices that were needed (i guess) for the film to move forward... but this is not a review of Speed. Ever since that article came out I have been wondering what an American film that told it's story through visuals would be like. Jean-Luc Godard of course has done films like this throughout his carrier, as has Wong Kar Wai, but it hasn't been possible for American directors to be able to do so, what with the demands of capatilism. Mike Figgis, with The Loss of Sexual Innocence, has been able to do just that.The photography by Benoit Delhomme was the most beautiful photography that I've seen in a film this year, which is a high praise considering Besieged and American Beauty and Fight Club were all this year as well.Figgis was able to do away with the need for dialogue, as most of the movie is either silent or in multiple languages without subtitles, but the story is displayed beautifully via the picture compositions and the structure of the film.By far one of the best films that i have seen. the images have and will continue to flood my mind the same way i might mentally revisit some of my favorate works of art by Bonnard or Picasso.

By intertwining his own semi-autobiographical story and that of Adam & Eve being cast out of the Garden of Eden, Figgis beautifully addresses each of the themes he introduces.This is a film which demands attention and patience - something that, frankly, most movie audiences cannot tolerate. It demands that the audience take an active role interpreting this largely silent (and beautifully shot) film. If you are willing to take the plunge, you will leave the theater immensely satisfied.This will perhaps be the most overlooked, under appreciated film of the year.
