[{"Title":"What a great movie!","Date":"21 April 2007","Score":"47 out of 52 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" This is one of the most captivating love stories I've ever seen on film. It starts with a young woman (Katya, played by Vera Alentova) reporting to her Worker's Dormitory friends that she has flunked by two points the exam to get into university. It ends with the most incredible sweetness of life.It is like a French film done by a Russian company (which is what it is). The Moscow we see that does not believe in tears does believe in love, and it is not a Moscow of politics, although some people do call one another comrade. This is a woman's point of view film (a chick flick) that transcends any genre cage. It begins slowly, almost painfully dull in a way that will remind the viewer of all the clich√©s about Russia, the unstylish dress, the worker's paradise that isn't, the sharp contrast between Moscow and the peasants who live outside the city. Katya works in a factory. She works at a drill press. She is obviously underemployed. Lyudmila (Irina Muravyova) works in a bakery. She is probably gainfully employed for the time and place. They are friends, twentysomethings who are on the make for a man, but not a man from the sticks. They pretend to be university post docs or something close to that and they impress some people as they house-sit a beautiful Moscow apartment.This is how their adult life begins in a sense. Lyudmila falls in love with an athlete; Katya becomes infatuated with a television cameraman. One thing leads to another and before we know it they are forty. Neither relationship worked out. The athlete becomes an alcoholic, the cameraman, in the sway of his mother, believes that Katya is beneath him (once he finds out that she works in a factory). How wrong he is, of course.But no more of the plot. I won't spoil it. The plot is important. The characterizations are important. The story is like a Russian novel in that it spans lots of time, but once you are engaged you will find that the two and a half hours fly by and you will, perhaps like me, say at the end What a great movie! My hat is off to director Vladimir Menshov and to Valentin Chernykh who wrote the script and to the cast. I've mentioned Vera Alentova and Irina Muravyova, but Aleksey Batlov who played Gosha was also excellent. I don't want to say anymore. Just watch the film. It is one of the best I've ever seen.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)

There were the normal problems of living in Moscow, particularly for the 3 young women trying to make it under very difficult circumstances. The things they do (particularly Lyudmilla) are funny and yet give us a glimpse into how difficult it must have been for them. Katya, the main character, goes through her trials but comes out on top. She does better than anyone else (out of the 3), even raises a daughter (without a husband), but she secretly longs for a man in her life. After many failed attempts are relationships she accidentally meets the man who turns out to be the perfect one for her. However, they too go through some struggles before coming to the final realization that they belong together. It is a wonderful story of struggles, successes, and life in general. The acting was wonderful, particularly the actress who played Katya. Her young daughter (Alexandra) was adorable. The scene I liked the most was Gosha invites Katya and her daughter to a picnic, to get to know each other better (after declaring that he is going to marry Katya). Katya is tired and she just falls asleep in a chair in the fresh air. Gosha gently puts a blanket on her. Very simple, but very caring and touching. There are many wonderful moments in the movie. The humor is sprinkled throughout and it is very refreshing to see a movie like this one. The most valuable thing to me was it gave a glimpse into life in the USSR, and yet we can relate to the story and the characters on a human level.

Moskva slezam ne verit (called Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears in English) starts out portraying three college friends in 1958, and picks up twenty years later.In 1958, Katya (Vera Alentova) is motivated, hard-working and bright, while Liudmila (Irina Muravyova) is manipulative, shallow and scheming, and Antonina (Raisa Ryazanova) is shy and simple. They're all from the countryside, but all looking to get jobs in the city. Over the next few days, Antonina ends up with one Nikolai, and these two are the most traditional; Liudmila ends up with hockey player Sergei. Katya, meanwhile, gets filmed for a TV project on the factory by cinematographer Rudolph, who ends up getting her pregnant. They try to talk things over at a park bench, but he just leaves.Twenty years later, the movie focuses on Katya's redemption, one might say. She is now the director at the factory (and even gets to drive to work, practically unheard of in the USSR), and her daughter Alexandra is doing quite well. Granted, Katya's successful in her public life, but what about privately? It looks as though her personal life will remain empty until she meets one Gosha (Alexei Batalov), an honest, outspoken, perceptive fellow. She does meet Rudolph again - and this time he's going by his real name Rodion (he called himself Rudolph because western names were popular in the '50's) - but she leaves him at the bench.This movie makes an interesting use of duality. There are two meetings in the park; Rudolph/Rodion leaves Katya the first time, but she leaves him the second time. Rudolph/Rodion makes two speeches about how TV is the wave of the future and will eliminate theater, movies, and books. There are two trips to the countryside. Katya twice falls asleep crying. Katya is twice filmed for a TV interview by Rudolph/Rodion; she's working at the factory the first time, and she's the director the second time. And finally, there are two scenes where people dance to Besame mucho. And watch how they use the alarm clock in the middle of the film.Among other things, how Gosha and Rudolph/Rodion bond at the end is classic for Soviet cinema. And, we get to see remnants of the '50's and '70's that even we in the west can understand as teenagers, the girls swoon over movie stars (and their socks looked kind of like bobby sox), and people wear colorful clothes in the '70's. A classic in every sense of the word.

We see idealistic poets who say the older generation made mistakes, women promoted to executive positions, a film produced by the State yet approaching sexual themes, Western idolization, the drudgery of repetitive industrial work, and class distinctions between the haves and have-nots.Also of interest is the protagonist's view of herself. Without revealing plot twists, it is suffice to say that a woman is socially seen as submissive to the man. This is a shock to Western sensibilities of women's equality, especially as we see her ordeals as a result of a man's selfishness and dominance. What is revealing is that she, herself does not rebel against the System. She works within the parameters, creates her own success, and becomes transformed.Being Western, I found myself questioning whether she had truly achieved something. The crown of achievement, we are taught, is independence, equality. Whereas she achieved that in a career and in her lifestyle, in her heart, she yearned for a man, to be the little wife, and to submit herself to a patriarchal marriage. But, in the end, who are we to judge another's happiness?

With a big possibility that your husband would booze himself up too much.No doubt this film's acting makes its strongest feature.

At the time I thought it was one of the funniest things I had seen in a long long time. I saw it again when our World Movie channel broadcast it and I laughed just as hard and just as long.  To understand the comedy in what appears to be a story of feminist angst you need to be Russian.  There is no other way to see it.  We don't see that the supposed conflict between between the heroine and her lover is that she is a manager and he is not.  It's much more primal than that.  It is because she EARNS more than he does.  Women held managerial positions in the USSR since they first began driving tanks and tractors during the second world war.  Most of us are brought up to believe that we can do just about anything, and a lot of the time we have to.  So please, if you see this film, remember to laugh.  Remember that Yes, Russians aren't happy unless they're miserable but the story of this film is also about the joy of rebuilding lives and relationships for both men and women and about the triumph of the human spirit over seemingly impossible odds.

If the acting or the direction was worse then the result could have been another forgettable drama. Soviet filmmakers, however, specialized in drama films. This is because of the restrictions that were put on them by the government.

But many times I've noticed some details in the plot which made me estimating again what is really happening there, and what were the writer's main idea in such a plot. The acting is also brilliant, and after seeing this movie several times, each another time makes me thinking again about my and our life, and also about the type of the gender relationships which concerns lies.The story begins in the late 50's, and the first part concerns the lives of the characters at their early 20's. Then, the film jumps about 20 years forward, and the second part concerns the lives of the characters at their late 30's (or early 40's). The first time you see this movie, most of the interest is how did the lives changed over the 20 years, and what kind of an end the movie has. But it turns out that almost every scene and cite play an important role there, and after seeing it a few times I noticed that the movie is not just about the tales of the three girls and how does lives change.For example, each of the parts is built by a pattern where the first half tells about the lives of the three girls, and the second half tells about Katya's (main character's) relationship with a boyfriend. In each of the parts the relationship isn't built in a pure way, since Katya must hide some facts about her (and even lie) to make sure everything will go on (I think this is the reason for making Gosha a macho man, and seeing it again you may find out what makes him behave like that). But in the two parts there are different kind of lies and relationships, and I think that makes the writer to put different endings at the parts. Although the first part has a sad end (what also reflects Katya's life further), in the second part the relationship doesn't break after Katya's boyfriend finds the truth about her.Besides this example, there are many other topics about life which this film concerns. Seeing it enough times makes you sure that Gosha isn't as awful as he seems to be at the first time you see the movie (his past is barley mentioned, but when you find it out, it clears the scene where he meets Nikolay, and what will be afterwards), and therefore the ending may be concerned good.Again, this film may be watched again and again, in a very entertaining way, and each time telling you more about the plot. I think that such a film is a masterpiece.

A young girl from a small town comes to Moscow and becomes pregnant.  Her lover repudiates her, the lover's mother humiliates her, telling her that she is not a good fit for her big-city dandy son.  Rather than leave Moscow and go back to her parents, or try to perform an abortion on herself, the heroine has the baby.  She works hard at the factory, getting up at 5 AM every morning, passes grueling entrance exams into college, becomes an engineer -- all while raising her little girl as a single parent and an unwed mother.  Bold subject matter for a Soviet movie made in the seventies.Then -- a compromise the heroine who, sixteen years after her ordeal, has a good life, a good home, and a prestigious managerial job, falls head over heals for a man who treats her like dirt.Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears was made almost at the same time as the equally celebrated Workplace Romance (Sluzhebnyj Roman), and they are, in a sense, competitors.  Both movies are about single women in their mid- to late thirties who made a brilliant career but were never married.  Both heroines are presented as strong-willed, independent individuals in managerial positions, whose lives are nevertheless missing something.  But if Sluzhebnyj Roman says that life is incomplete without love, Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears says that life is incomplete without a man.Women of the older generation are all in love with Moscow's main male character -- the heroine's ultimate husband.  I cannot fathom why -- the actor's cute, but his character is unnerving.  One does not need to be a feminist to have a strong urge to throw this man down the stairs.  He stifles every impulse of individuality in her; he presumes to know what she wants, what's proper for her and what's not; he patronizes her; he pushes her around.  On the train, he begins their acquaintance by commenting You have the eyes of a woman who is not married. (What kind of eyes are those?) I cannot see why one would find any charm in such familiarity and cocky self-assurance from a stranger.It's worth noting that the corresponding character in Sluzhenyj Roman -- an excessively mild-mannered, shy man -- learns to stand up to the bossy heroine, but does so without disrespecting her.  The character in Moscow, on the contrary, puts the heroine in her proper place -- which is to be quiet and follow orders.I think that a Western critic would perceive the ending of Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears as ironic and sad.  The heroine, a woman who spent her life making something of herself by overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles, is last shown fussing around her kitchen for the benefit of a man who was not with her on that long journey, who dares to raise his voice at her in her own home, while eating her food, and who acts as if his very physical presence at the table confers a rare privilege  on a woman whose clock is ticking.

So this movie starts with the friendship of three women characters then shows how their lives are changed when two gets married and other didn't as she got pregnant and her boyfriend left her and then goes to their later stage of lives when they are not young any more and how their lives have changed. In short, I can say it is kind of character study from start to end (as characters grow at every segment of the movie like in the beginning they are in hostel having fun, partying and all, working, then get married, become mother and then later stage when one is successful but not that lucky in love, other lucky in love others having mixed life). Acting by the main character is very good and believable as fun loving girl, traditional at times, working women (working in factory with men's and even better at her job than others, she even repairs the machines), mother, and at the end lover. Other casts too are good and works well. Direction is good too. I think the reason for me liking this movie is its simplicity, in the story, the way it is presented; in down to earth characters one someone can relate to easily.

While they are studying, they work in blue collar, factory jobs, but dream of escaping that life by marrying some powerful men. When a professor asks them to take care of his nice apartment while he's traveling, they see this as a perfect opportunity to impersonate women of higher status than they are and woo some eligible man into the apartment. One of the girls woos a famous athlete, another named Katya (who eventually becomes the center of the movie and is played by the beautiful Vera Alentova) gets involved with a cameraman in the then new medium of television. Eventually, Katya gets pregnant from the encounter with him, and when he realizes that she is a factory girl instead of a professor's daughter, decides to have nothing to do with her (he is in part afraid of the rejection of his snobbish mother, and the subtext of this, of course, is that the Soviet Union was far from a classless society). She thinks about aborting her baby, but eventually gives birth to a daughter and decides to raise her alone.The movie then cuts to twenty years later. While her friends have married but remain trapped in a drab, working class life, Katya has remained single but has prospered professionally. She is now a director in a factory (a prestigious job in Soviet times) and lives in a nice apartment with her daughter, who is now a young woman. Despite her professional success, Katya is still looking for love, though she usually ends up in doomed affairs (for instance, when she gets involved with a married man). Eventually, she finds a promising prospect with Gosha, a masculine blue collar worker she finds on the train. But just when the relationship starts to develop, the long forgotten cameraman reappears in her life.One of the interesting things of this movie is to get a glimpse of Soviet life at the late Brezhnev era, a time of relative prosperity&#x85; Sometimes the director goes for the easy reaction of the public, and modern audiences might not always approve of some of the cultural mores.

Because it's presented in two parts which, when combined, make for a fairly long movie, it has time not only to follow its characters but to develop themes -- prominent being that of the loneliness of people in the big city and the sometimes unwise things they do to relieve it.Because of the wise scope it moves slowly, but that and the effective device of setting in two distant times allows for the payoff of some affecting moments in the second half. While it's nominally a drama-comedy, it means more on the side of drama, and sometimes feels almost novelist in its wide scope. It was also interesting to see how it addressed various aspects of the social implications of the introduction of television and the social effects of income disparity in the two times.

Director by Vladimir Menshov and written by Valentin Chernykh, the movie tells the 20 years story of three Russian women who come to Moscow from smaller towns Katerina Tikhomirova (Vera Alentova), Lyudmila (Irina Muravyova), and Antonina (Raisa Ryazanova) in search for better life. Only to find that the search is more complex, than they thought. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say that the first half of the film, set in the 1959s, during Khrushchev Thaw, was really dull and boring. It's really a shame, because it would be, nice to see, more on these women's reaction, to the change in reform in their country since De-Stalinization. It would have been better, if the movie set the events during the 1963's Cuban Mission Crisis. It would be, nice to see, how the average soviet citizen was thinking of the event. Sadly, film content like that, would more likely be heavily circumscribed and subject to censorship and bureaucratic state control. Instead, the film doesn't get good, until the movie took a 20 year leap forward in time, to 1979. It's here, that one of the women's stories really outshine the others. In my opinion, the movie should have been all about Katerina's struggles. Not only, is the actress, the better of the three women, but her character has the most complex and entertaining story-line. Even, with a huge time jump, you see her character, transform from a weak factory worker in the beginning of the film into a strong-will single mother, factory director, by the end. It just sucks that the movie gloss over, how she became so mature. It would been interesting to see, the years that she had to go, through the double burden of a job and family-raising responsibilities. It really surprise me; that they didn't focus on that, because it was very common, for Soviet women at the time. Still, I like how they shown a working woman, was able to reach the executive level, in a male-driven field. It's very rare to see a film, like this, both in the Soviet Union and the United States at the time. I just wish, they show, how she rose the ranks to become the woman that she was, toward the end of the film. The movie could have been, easily just be about that, but the movie didn't want to seem, too extreme in its Feminism outlook. So, the movie focus more on, her trying to fall back in love, after a previous man have left her, to rise a child on her own. It's here, where the audience is introduce to Gosha (Aleksey Batalov), a tool-and-die maker. He's one of the better characters in the film. He is a very complex fella, that's mostly entertaining. The only complain that I have, about his character is the weak conflict. Despite that, the movie still shows that he's a good man. Aleksey Batalov plays him, very well. One of the bigger faults, about watching this movie, today, is how dated, it is. Not only does, this movie have some really questionable old-school beliefs about relationships and gender roles. It's somewhat offensive, when you think about it. Still, I can understand that it's a product of the times. One of the funnier moments in the film, is when Rudolph/Rodion (Yuri Vasilyev) makes two speeches about how TV is the wave of the future and will eliminate theater, movies, and books. I guess, he didn't count on, the internet, being made. The true value of the film is its reflection of the Russian culture and traditions. Anyone interested in better understanding the Russian way of life should see this film. It's nice to see, that not everything in the Soviet Union wasn't so gloomy. Even, US President Ronald Reagan watched the film several times prior to his meetings with the President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in order to gain a better understanding of the Russian people. So it's clear, that this movie does work, but it's still questionable to me, if this movie should have deserve the 1981 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1980. I mean, it's alright, but it's no way beats 1980's Kagemusha. After all, if you take away, the fact that it was made in Soviet Union, it feels like a generic soap opera or chick flick. There wasn't much, substance. While, the movie was shot, pretty well. There were hardly anything great with them. The only one, worth noticing is the park scene, with the long panning shot. In my opinion, it was just alright, but it's pretty eerily, how close, this version is, with the shot in 1979's Kramer vs Kramer. Another problem with the film is the DVD quality. I have, not yet, seen a good version of this film. Most of the audio kinda sucks. I can barely hear what's going on. The English subtitles are bit questionable. I really doubt the Russian language have a word for Hillbilly or Hicks. I would rather, take the Russian slang, than it trying to be go all the way, with the English language. It was a bit jarring. Overall This is not your typical Bolshevist movie. It's very unique. A must-watch for anybody, trying to understand Russian culture. If, that's your cup of borscht, more power to you! Check it out!

Vladimir Menshov's work has shaken me, after all many American people think that Russia represents one drunks, bears and caps with ear-flaps. Why Russia became object of similar sneers? Remember Norway, Germany, after all they had the same in those of year, a vivid example to that a film Life of others (2005). I consider the given film good not only because of respect for the great country, Russia, but also because of ingenious game of actors and an unforgettable history of the unfortunate women living after Lenin revolution.

It starts following the lives of a large group of Russian teens in 1958. However, it follows them through the next 20 years as well. The movie gets more and more interesting as the characters evolve to become more serious. The gradual ageing of the players is quite well done, and pangs of nostalgia for how short life is. Nothing too dramatic happens, marriages, divorces, unplanned pregnancies, meddling mothers. It is all in Russian with subtitles. The characters, though often silly, love each other a lot, and stand by each other. Everyone just revels in the joy of hanging out with friends. It makes you wish you were Russian. "},{"Title":"A nice portrayal of people and relations","Date":"27 August 2012","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":" The film Moscow doesn't believe in tears has many characteristics of the typical Bolshevist movie. First of all, the plot develops at quite a slow pace. The director is not in a hurry, for there are no budget restrictions, apart from the materials. And the audience values a quiet and calm life style. And secondly, the story contains little passion or energy - although all people struggle to survive. Russian Bolshevists know that they are nothing more than a face amidst the masses. Their ideal is spending a weekend in their datsja (second house). In this respect the film strongly differs from Die Legende von Paul und Paula, made in East-Germany at about the same time (recommended). In addition Moscow doesn't believe in tears describes daily events in the lives of common people. Nonetheless, the film is certainly not boring. In fact it is amazing (just read on). Let me briefly sketch the story, so that you can judge if it is your thing. In the thirties of the last century three female laborers, Katja, Ljudmilla, and Tonja, work in a production plant. They live together on the campus of the factory. Of course they all want to marry. Tonja quickly finds and is satisfied with a laborer. Katja and especially Ljudmilla aim higher, and pretend to be intellectuals. They organize parties and evenings for real intellectuals. Ljudmilla is successful, whereas Katja is less lucky. She befriends a camera man of the TV station, Rodion, and becomes pregnant. When Rodion discovers that she is actually just a laborer, he immediately leaves her. Then the story jumps another twenty years into the future. Katja has a grownup daughter, and has become the director of her company (not very credible). She is still single (after the war men were scarce). But finally she meets an instrument maker, Gosha. Within one day he proposes, and Katja doesn't seem to be unhappy about it. But then Rodion emerges again. He has been married twice, is still a camera man, and likes to start again with Katja. Obviously she is no longer interested, and refuses him in favor of Gosha. Quiet happiness, and end of story. So what is typical about this film? Evidently it relates to the lives of laborers, and Katja has even been praised as a hero of labor (just a medal, a simple thank you, no money involved). Clearly the script writer has more sympathy for instrument makers than for camera men. He transforms the intellectual of Ljudmilla into a drunkard. Everything is real life (realism), there are no false sentiments. Bolshevism doesn't believe in tears. The plain message is that happiness will come to the patient ones. In a Bolshevistic society chances are abundant and patience is a virtue. However, although the film reflects on the Bolshevistic society and its values, it is certainly not propaganda. It is simply a nice portrayal of people and relations, that tries to satisfy the good-natured observer. Amazing, isn't it? If I use the word amazing at least three times, when I write a review, then the IMDb team is satisfied.

The title seems to come from a Eurovision-type song, though it's not clear exactly who or what 'Moscow' is meant to represent - the Kremlin perhaps. It's a long film but maintains momentum after a manic start and few scenes outstay their welcome - many skip onto the next before we're ready. There's a thick overlay of tacky music, sometimes inappropriate, and loads of dismal but fascinating 70s interior d√©cor. The Russians too are a strange bunch, especially in the brusque way they treat strangers that seems to come from a 'don't-expect-anything-from-me' kind of social inhibition rather than hostility. But this is basically soap opera and the psychology is unconvincing. The woman is formidable at her job, rising from factory worker to some kind of director - almost a national celebrity - yet all the while floundering in her emotional life. She is cold, severe and humourless in the office. If that was meant to represent some spiritual sacrifice, it didn't come across. The little wistfulness in her personality is hardly enough to make her likable. You could pick any woman off the street and find a more involving story. In Part 1 she gets pregnant first time over Besame Mucho (it always works) to a guy who's not interested in her. Part 2 resumes 17 or so years later when she finally meets that rare commodity, a decent guy - giving us two emotionally charged bookends to a bleak, workaday, if economically comfortable life. Mr Perfect though is annoying in his unconventional charm and the film gets a little wayward towards the end. This beat The Last Metro and Kagemusha to the best foreign language Oscar in 1980 - no doubt because it portrayed the Soviets as human and fallible as everyone else, which must have been a relief to the rest of the world.

At the end, to be polite, I told a Soviet Embassy staffer, You Russians make better French films than the French. (This is a good film, but it's European, jerky and the plot takes second place to people gossiping, like in an Eric Rohmer movie.) Then I naively asked, Is the Soviet Union like that?Huh? This film bears as much resemblance to Soviet Russia as 'Midnight Cowboy' resembles America. It became controversial because it accepted officially that a woman's life in the Soviet Union was not perfect. Duh?Nevertheless, the music at the beginning is great (Alexandra, Alexandra...) and the film is simply good fun, if you're curious about Soviet life. Any Russian born in Soviet times will enjoy it. If you have an older Russian visiting, and you want to be a good host, mention this film or make it available. A cure for homesickness. In 100 years, will Russians (or anyone else) watch this film? Maybe, but I suspect that a Russian, film-making Emile Zola will appear between now and then. And anyway, there are better film records of Soviet life.

I think this is a pure piece of cinema and I don't know if this is true, but I suspect the movie shows exactly what the director meant to (and that's why I say it is honest).I am from Portugal, therefore a western, and so there were some attitudes and things in the characters lives that I found at first strange and inadequate, even 23 years ago, and so this movie was a good document for me to understand a bit more of the great russian people.The movie debates many questions, moral questions, social questions, inserted in a different society from mine, which presents diferent solutions and different postures in front of the problems. So we have the typical case of the single mother, with all her difficulties to be accepted and to suceed. But the message of the film comes in the end. She doesn't do what the public would like her to do, which would be either to remain single or to marry only if she really loved the husband and him to her. She doesn't do that. She marries in the end a man who is not what we might call an ideal man, quite far from that. He is a machist guy, who what's to rule her wife. But maybe that's the true happiness for her (since she spend a hole life alone, fighting against rejection for being alone with a child, maybe she now just wants to enjoy a married life, to do now what was the concept of a normal life when she was young). Or maybe not... Maybe she has just stopped fighting and left herself into the hands of a man who, not being perfect, is at least a man. There is a third option, which is what I think it's right she loved the man (she even said he had no bad things), and he loved her (the machism and the attitude are due to society, we maight say...), and so, in this case, this would be a love story, very sensitive, in my opinion, but a different love story. Still other ways of seeing the meaning of the movie should be accepted (the true piece of art is the one which allows herself to be interpreted in inumerous ways...).I also noticed the very interesting contrast between the three girls, among which the first one to marry seemed to have the more regular and happy life of all. The other girl, who married the sportsman, didn't suceed and seems to have a decadent life in her middle age. Then we have the main character, who has already been spoken.Also an excelent not to the soundtrack... and this the way a post cold war portuguese educated person sees this movie...8/10 "},{"Title":"You cannot imagine how good the life was in USSR!!!","Date":"29 May 2004","Score":"9 out of 22 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Review":"  The Movie is splendid.Well paced, classic filming stile, doesn't look old.

The shooting and editing is complete, not waisting time to be too artistic(because it is not a Art-House film). This is a professional cinema work with normally composed drama,but not only so.The story begins in 1958, soon after the short thaw(ottepeli) had come to Soviet society, when Soviet cinema was full of hope and energy. So it is natural that young girls go to the theater with the board announcing Festival of French films and they dream of better life,to marry celebrity, to become rich. It was so that moment.Screenwriter and director are utterly right to jump 20 years and then to start telling about their own time(film was made in late 70s). Dreams of youth were betrayed by the reality, but not so cruelly for ordinary people(different form intelligentsia),as Western right conservatives may have imagined. In Soviet Union lived such ordinary people, as well as intelligentsia under political pressure and many other social types(it happened and happens in USA, Japan and any other countries).We don't know how Katya suffered from personal complex and from possible injustice, but such things will make no sense to drama.

It's about as ridiculous as the gutter rubbish produced by Hollywood conglomerates. Punctuated by dull, sleep inducing scenes of Russians eating, drinking and discussing nothing in particular, it doesn't really go anywhere. The lives of a few Russian women are given selective treatments, from their work as slaves in the glorious proletarian factories, repeating menial tasks, to wanting to get laid. It's not intellectually stimulating, very tedious to behold and has no complicated storyline. People come and go without any loud drums or narrative.What is so infantile is that the writers managed to cram nonsensical and inconsistent story lines just to fit the required amount of implantation of central committee doctrine, from mild scenes of elites eating well to the 'happy at the end love scene' that is entirely preposterous and incredulous to believe.Moscow Does not Believe in Tears does not even function as passable entertainment because, frankly said, it's boring. There's not much attempt to examine the women's lives at all, it's just all so very convenient to present us with conflicts and their convenient denouements.It is really hard to believe that Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears (1979) beat out Akira Kurosawa's brilliant and far superior Kagemusha (1980) for a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.
