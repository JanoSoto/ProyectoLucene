Living in a house where fairy tale literature is commonplace (my wife studies Children's Literature), I was surprised by this film. Seeing it in the value bin at most video stores, I expected poor production, horrible direction, and a pathetic cast. We have all seen these films that boast big names, but somehow never fully follow through. Freeway is nothing of the kind. It is a carefully written and delivered retelling of one of our most beloved fairy tales with a extremely dark twist.Reece Witherspoon (pre-Legally Blonde) gives a performance that surprised me. I did not realize that she was so capable of bringing this character to life. Her counterpart, the illustrious 'Wolf', played by 80s child Keifer Sutherland, is yet another powerful force in this film. The two of them nearly carry this film on their shoulders. This is one of those perfect examples of a film that did not have much publicity after its release, but has since then obtained 'cult' status through avid viewer's word of mouth. This is definitely a film for all movie critics, film buffs, and fanatics to gaze at just once. I know there were some poor reviews when it was first released, but I am sure that a second viewing would bring this gem back to life.I would also like to add that director Matthew Bright is a film genius. He successfully took a very wholesome and good natured story (or that we think) and transforms it into the fearsome dark story that it should be. Our society has the consistency of taking dark elements and transforming them into stories for our children. A wolf eats a grandmother in this story &#133; how happy and uplifting is that? I applaud Bright for taking this story and transforming it into a modern day fairy tale. It is gripping, fascinating, and downright beautiful.If you enjoyed Natural Born Killers and was hoping for a nicer twist, this film is your answer. I also suggest that if you couldn't get enough of Freeway that you try to get your hands on the very rare Freeway 2 Confessions of a Trickbaby. See how Bright delicately transforms yet another dark fairy tale (Hansel and Gretel) into a modern masterpiece.Grade ***** out of *****  "},{"Title":"I was lucky to find this one!

I had seen bits and pieces of this movie on cable and couldn't believe how good it was, but back in those days we didn't have channel info. This movie is wickedly funny, and Reese Witherspoon plays the most hilarious, bad-girl, tough trailer trash role I've ever seen and plays it fantastically. The slutty makeup and outfits she wears as well as the endless stream of profanity she swears are definitely a lot different than her modern day good girl roles she seems stuck in now. This movie is funnier than you can possibly imagine, as things keep happening that just blow you away or shock the pants off you and no main character is what they seem to be at first. Definitely unpredictable, this dark comedy is a rare lost gem I was glad to find again.

How Reese Witherspoon didn't win an Academy Award for this is a mystery. I have found new respect for Reese and glad to know she isn't all about fluff movies catering to woman (i.e., Sweet Home Alabama).

But Witherspoon brings a fighting charm to the lead character, Venessa Lutz, who has just about everything bad thrown at her that a young person can have thrown at them while growing up. She survives and prevails with grittiness, will and humor. As far from an angel as you can get she becomes vigilante and enforcer of her own brand of justice to a particularly malevolent form of evil visited on by Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland) and an uncaring and unbelieving law enforcement system. It's really a small classic and should be viewed without any predjudice of youth crime. It then becomes an eloquent statement for better and more rational treatment of young offenders.

Reminiscent of the films of John Waters, it's a satire of such unfunny things as serial killings, drug abuse, prostitution, sexual abuse of underage children, prison life, random acts of violence, and suicide. Like the best Waters, Matthew Bright finds the pathos in all of these things, shaping the movie into a nihilistic comedy.Reese Witherspoon is absolutely marvelous as her character, Vanessa Lutz, a sharp-witted white trash girl who makes the best out of every situation she finds herself in. Her mother is a drug-addled prostitute. Her stepfather is a jobless, sexually abusive moron who also hits the pipe. Vanessa herself has a history of being in trouble with the law and has trouble reading, but she's far from stupid. We never once doubt that she will prevail, no matter how desperate her situation becomes. Vanessa is forced to make a move one day when her parents are arrested and a social worker plans on sending Vanessa to another foster home. Unable to face that prospect, she gives her social worker the slip and hits the road to search for her grandmother, who she has never met and who is not even aware of Vanessa's existence. Vanessa's life takes a detour when her car breaks down and she is picked up by Kiefer Sutherland. She does not know that he is the I-5 Killer, a pathetic but cunning serial murderer who preys on young women he plucks from the freeway. Unfortunately for him, he comes up against the wrong victim when he targets Vanessa. The rest of the story is best left unsaid, although Roger Ebert gave away most of the plot in his review of the film from 1996 (don't ya just love when he does that?). Bright actually references John Waters several times, first by inserting a brief passage that features the opening theme from Pink Flamingos and also by making a plot point out of the fact that Vanessa, who is white, has a thing for black guys (much like Penny Pingleton in Hairspray). The dialogue is often outrageous, too. But unlike Waters' early films, Freeway is technically well-made and structurally better. It also features a number of terrific cameos and roles, including Brooke Shields as Sutherland's snooty, blissfully ignorant wife.Fans of offbeat movies in general might really love Freeway, while others should probably approach it with a strong stomach.

But in Matthew Bright's Freeway we have a solid script, confident direction, an excellent supporting cast, and a gleefully twisted world view, all backing up a boldly brilliant star-turn performance by Reese Witherspoon. Her Vanessa Lutz is brazen, coarse, violent, manipulative, and seemingly doomed no matter which way she turns. But at the end of the day, of every day, she remains her own person, and nothing can intimidate or stop her. Witherspoon seems to live and breathe this demanding role, with never a hint of 'acting a part' -- which is to say she is doing some very fine acting indeed. Vanessa Lutz is a role like Forrest Gump, though even more challenging, where one tiny step out of character would spoil the whole thing. But Miss Witherspoon never misses.Plus, it was great to see Kiefer Sutherland play a smarmy, goody-two-shoes psychopathic villain. Much more fun than his trained chipmunk limp-wrist tendentiousness in 24. I have seen no evidence that this man can actually act, but he really does not need to here. When he first appeared on screen I thought, 'Oh no, this movie's over.' But soon I discovered, to my delight, that he he had been cast precisely for his pathetic loser quality.For some reason IMDB classifies Freeway as a 'crime/drama,' which mostly misses the point. It is a diabolical black comedy with lots of violent action, some of it realistic, but most of it wonderfully absurd. All in all it earns a solid 8/10 for being funny and satisfying, a movie which I would happily watch again.

The film begins much like any other hitchhiking film, with a young girl being picked up by a slightly sinister driver. However, you won't be able to predict where it's going to go from there, as Freeway continually puts its characters in absurd situations and delivers the unexpected. The plot doesn't exactly adhere to the story of Little Red Riding Hood, and after the basics have been laid down, it's basically anyone's game right down to the gripping and hilarious climax. The film sees Reese Witherspoon's juvenile delinquent being picked up by Kiefer Sutherland's child psychologist after fleeing from her home when her mother and step father are arrested. After telling the psychologist of her relationship with her step father, she soon realises that he's enjoying what she's saying a little too much; and it's not long before she asks him if he's the infamous I-5 killer, and he doesn't do anything to convince her he's not...Freeway doesn't introduce any characters that are particularly likable, and all are guilty to a degree. Most audience members will be on the side of Witherspoon's character, as although she certainly has personality problems, she's great fun to watch and her twisted logic isn't usually far from being spot on! Witherspoon got one of her best roles in this film, and really does carry it despite her young age. Kiefer Sutherland stars alongside her, and it's rather odd seeing him in the psycho role after getting so used to him being Jack Bauer in 24. He does do it great, however. Perhaps the best thing about this film is the pitch black humour that goes hand in hand brilliantly with the absurdity of the piece. The plot is really freewheeling, and the film jumps from road thriller to prison drama to the court room in the blink of an eye, and this helps to ensure that the audience is always kept on their toes. This film won't appeal to people that don't like their movies to be pitch black and unpleasant, but anyone who enjoys a good does of absurdity shouldn't hesitate to track this film down!

Weiss) are arrested for prostitution and a parole violation, Vanessa (Reese Witherspoon) hits the road for Granny's house.Along the way she meets rapist/kiddie porn-loving psychologist Bob Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland) and pumps some bullets into him for his inevitable transgression.The narrative here is deliberately nuts and the perverted tone is not to be taken seriously. Trash-loving director Mathew Bright, who also helmed the gloriously exploitive BUNDY, blends elements from slasher movies, courtroom dramas, women-in-prison (WIP) epics, horror flicks and soft core porn flicks into this fascinating celluloid stew.Bright, like Larry Clark, appears to be cinematic ally obsessed with women's crotches and panties and sexually promiscuous girls of the under aged or barely legal variety (this is not a criticism, merely an observation). In one zipper-busting scene, a semi-crippled hottie stands up into frame to give us a front seat view of her crotch. During a fight amongst prison inmates, dresses are ripped asunder and, as expected, lesbian love finds a home in Vanessa's jail cell.The festering air of sleaze and shameless exploitation makes FREEWAY a refreshing little number. You can only admire Bright's affectionate approach to the trashy material and be grateful that the once-great John Waters did not get a crack at it.The resolution at Granny's house is too predictable to carry any weight, but the trip itself is never boring.Witherspoon is a ball of angry talent in her first major starring role and has done nothing this interesting since.

Plot is darkly based around the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale and sees young runaway Vanessa Lutz (Witherspoon) hit the road after her parents are arrested. Setting off to visit her grandmother she agrees to a lift from the kind and well spoken Bob Wolverton (Sutherland), only to find that he's not as nice as she first thought. He in turn is in for a big surprise himself since Vanessa is more than capable of looking after herself.Twisted and richly humorous, Matthew Bright's movie oozes originality and quite frankly deserves to be better appreciated never mind better known! Going into it for a first time completely oblivious to its structure will arguably aid the experience. Suffice to say that the less known about it prior to viewing it the better. All I have to say is that it's violent, sweary and contains very sexually explicit dialogue, so if those things are likely to offend then perhaps stay away from it. But what if I offer up that those things are dealt with a satirical bent? That the tough scenes, and some of them are very tough, are basis to a caustic narrative about social hypocrisy and the often stupidity of the law? Interested? You should be, because once viewed you're unlikely to forget it. It's no surprise to see Oliver Stone's name etched onto the production credits, since this very much feels like a dirty second cousin to his Natural Born Killers. I'd argue that here we have the better acted film with Witherspoon and Sutherland giving virtuoso performances with admirable support coming from the likes of Bodison, Shields and Murphy.One of the most undervalued film's of the 90s?

I also never knew Reese could be this vicious and fight like that, and it's a shame that this didn't make much money, because great films like these are not getting the credit they deserve instead it's always Lord of the rings, or Harry Potter, etc etc,plus it was creepy how Kifer Sutherland's change in character happened just like that!. Another one of my favorite moments is when Reese gives this guy hell and locks him in the trunk since he was only going to pay 5$!, and it would be cool if they made an actual official sequel for this, plus it also had two cool fight scenes one in the prison, the other at the end.

The story is a very personal and dared interpretation of the famous Little Red Riding Hood fairy-tale, transposed from the woods to present day California and featuring more appropriate menaces like prostitution, serial killers, drug addiction and child abuse. In her most fabulous performance ever (her recent brilliant portrayal of June Carter in Walk the Line not included), Reese Witherspoon stars as an illiterate and very unlucky teenager stuck in the lowest social class with a street-walking mother and a sex-hungry stepfather. When welfare officers once again try to put her in a foster family, she hopes to flee to her grandmother but ends even deeper in hell. She's offered a ride by a seemly caring psychologist who turns out a sadistic murderer that is difficult to beat! Freeway works as a disturbing thriller, but also as a tongue-in-cheek black comedy that illustrates human decay from a teenager's perspective. There are quite a lot of (major) plot holes in the script and some sequences &#150; especially in the second half of the film &#150; are a bit redundant, but Matthew Bright keeps it all very interesting with a fast pace and stylish art direction. Apart from Witherspoon and the always adequate Kiefer Sutherland, great acting talents can be found in the supportive cast, like Dan Hedaya, Amanda Plummer, Michael T. Weiss and Brittany Murphy. Even Brooke Shields is amazing in the last role you'd ever expect her to play! Danny Elfman's unique and quite petrifying musical score also contributes in making Freeway one of the most sensational post-Pulp Fiction thrillers and definitely a future classic.

Vanessa lands in jail but she does not stick long before she breaks out and joins a group of Hispanic girls who pull tricks on the side. All Vanessa wants to do is go to Stockton, California, so she can live with her grandmother rather than wind up in another horrible foster home.The dialogue brims with profanity and the subject matter is very unsavory.

For its time, it is a HUGE eye-opener and an outstanding attempt to recreate the fairy tale in a suburban fashion. It is simply riveting and very satisfying in terms of plot, action and character. I have never seen Reese Witherspoon kick so much ass ever. I don't understand why she didn't get any Oscar buzz for this one. This performance completely tops her part in Walk the Line. She is more than amazing in this film. You really don't wanna mess with her. She is capable of almost anything after what's been done to her. We still sympathize with her though because she's still compassionate and cares for what is right. She has a set of principles that she won't let anyone tread on. Being more of a Punisher, she is that strong heroine that uses her sense of justice to subdue those who wrong her, but at the same time, she's all about instinct and guts, she isn't your Lara Croft or your fancy Black Widow. She just acts on pure instinct of what is right and she understands that most of the time, reality is screwed up and doesn't care for what is wrong or right. I was left speechless at the sheer simplicity with which she conveys so much pain, anger and most of all strength. At the same time, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw what she could do. At the beginning of the movie, you can't picture her as that tough. But by the end of it, even those cops were smiling at her, thinking 'Okay, let's never upset this one or we'll get our asses whooped!' As for Sutherland, wow, he can play a real creep when he wants to and be good at it too. His facial expressions and his gestures tell everything you need to know about him as a killer. And at the beginning, when he's playing the good guy, he's so believable you know right away he's sure to be off his bonkers. I have to admit though, he's a tad underplayed. There's not enough focus on him. Also, I was expecting a little bit more from him, but Reese made up for whatever was missing. As a side note, Brittany Murphy is another nice touch to this movie. I have seen this kind of performance before, but I think she made it personal, as in she made you believe that she was the one going through all of that. I just wish she could have played more parts like this one, but I guess we'll never see that happening now...I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see Reese Witherspoon show her acting props. I really miss this side of her. Now she's more into sweet, sugary indie movies which aren't all bad, they just don't give her much to work with and waste some of her huge potential. Oh and that accent of hers needs to take front stage right now, it's adorable! Go watch this movie and you won't regret it! "},{"Title":"This movie has it all.

Witherspoon narrowly avoids being killed by Sutherland, seriously hurting him in the process and winding up in jail on a trumped-up assault charge. However, Witherspoon manages to escape so she and Sutherland can have a ferocious climactic showdown at her grandmother's house, which in this brilliantly twisted picture turns out to be a grimy mobile home located in a seedy whitetrash trailer park.Writer/director Matthew Bright relates this blithely amoral and energetic exploitation trash pip with a gut-bustingly savage and unmerciful sense of no-holds-barred caustic black-as-midnight humor, thus giving this deliciously demented doozy a frantically hoppin' electric charge and breezy irreverence that's impossible to either resist or dislike. Popping up in super supporting parts are Brooke Shields as Sutherland's snobby, unsuspecting wife, Amanda Plummer as Witherspoon's pathetic junkie hooker mom, Michael T. Weiss as Witherspoon's skeevy abusive stepdad, Brittany Murphy as a cheery lesbian, and Sydney Lassick as a jolly trailer park manager. Great barn-storming opening theme by Danny Elfman, too. And Witherspoon is a terrifically tart, brash and foul-mouthed revelation in what remains her best-ever starring role to date.

Every character she has portrayed before or since has absolutely diminished by comparison. Assuming you have read the plot synopsis, allow me to just point out some great sleazy highlights crack use--check; hookers--check; juvie hall complete with cat fights--check; a serial killer, much sass from Reese, and a hilarious reference to Richard Speck (watch closely). Oh, and Amanda Plummer, whom you'd expect to see on an episode of Cops, as Vanessa's VERY tweaked out mama. Trust me on this one.

Clearly and explicitly a rewrite of Little Red Riding Hood although it has more to do with Natural Born Killers or Pulp Fiction than anything read to small children.There are movies in America that seem to take the view that killing is not killing, guns are not guns and death is death. This a perfect example. While set in the real world so much bad happens with such regularity that you know that you are living in pulp fiction (small case) city.Indeed the over-the-top regularity of bad things happening leads many to read this as a black comedy. This is surely a mistake as black comedy comes from irony or the unknowing. One human being shooting another (very much wishing them to be dead) is not black comedy.While many bad things happen, the movie isn't clever enough to only let bad things happen to those that really deserve it. Many lines/scenes seem to designed to shock and titillate - including child sex or at least descriptions of it.Like Tarantino director Matthew Bright forgets that less is sometimes more, and the threat of stepping over the line can be as dramatic as actually doing so. Sadly the director/writer Matthew Bright thinks that the drama only occurs if threat is then turned in to action.Although it does know a thing about having your cake and eating it to. Especially in the scenes between the fleeing Witherspoon and the creepy Kieifer Sutherland.What prevents this film from falling apart totally is the acting. Witherspoon is a total revelation in the lead role in that we normally see her as a sweet girl. Here her tiny face and pout are much more deadly -- indeed what we have here is bordering on the psychopathic.While many might read my comments as indicating that I didn't like the film it has its black charms and is very watchable. It is actually a product of what I call the new wild west -- movies in which characters crash about the place doing whatever they like and march to the beat of their own drum.Funny to some -- on a movie screen -- they are never funny in real life.

If you live in 1996, are a prostitute, and are hitchhiking, scurry away, because your life may be in danger. But if none of these characteristics fit your billing, then there is nothing that should be stopping you from watching Freeway, unless you are a prude to the tenth power.When it comes to movies as unhinged as Freeway, my love for all things absurd and trashy rises to unseemly biased levels. There is something about low-budgets and Tarantino-esque exchanges that touch me in the way that most films can hardly muster. Few can brag about having an ever- present crisis of tawdry characters getting into some seriously bad situations, and even fewer can say that they've devised a film so dauntless in its over-the-top personality that it nearly laughs itself to death.Witherspoon, who is best when playing against type, portrays Vanessa, a 16-year old delinquent who is anchored to the ground by her prostitute mother (Amanda Plummer) and drugged-out stepfather. In school, reading a sentence like The cat drinks milk is a feat of Shakespearian hardship, as Vanessa, more enticed to be called a badass in the slums of Los Angeles, is devastatingly illiterate. But anyone who lacks school smarts and lives on the bad streets of town is bound to be a little more unhinged in their fight in the rat race, after all.After her parents are arrested, Vanessa decides that she's done with the government, skips foster care, and heads towards the home of her grandmother, who she never has actually met. Only a few miles into the journey does her car breakdown &#x97; lucky for her, a clean-cut stranger (Kiefer Sutherland) comes to the rescue, introducing himself as Bob Wolverton, a high school counselor. Vanessa immediately confides in her makeshift chauffeur about all her weighty problems; but after traveling for a few hours, Wolverton's true nature is bitterly revealed. He turns out to be one of those sadistic creeps you read about in the paper &#x97; some may know him as the I-5 Killer. Vanessa isn't about to become some helpless next victim, however she is, fortunately, packing a pistol. She shoots her would-be murderer several times, takes all his money, and leaves him for dead. But chances are, when you leave someone for dead, they tend to not actually die, and, as the film would like to remind us over and over, Vanessa should have shot Wolverton just one more time.The saga of Freeway is as combative and unpredictable as the tabloid coverage of a true-crime cat-and-mouse game, its participants so grandiosely sinful in their shabby hysteria that, by the end, when Vanessa is completely exhausted, mascara streaming down her face like a jilted prom queen, her asking for a cigarette is as riotous as Lucy and Ethel trying as hard as they can to get the chocolates from overloading on the conveyor belt.Freeway is a comedy, but it's not a comedy for the Anchorman generation and maybe not even for the ones who thought The Carol Burnett Show was a shining jewel in television. It's mean-spirited enough to drive Regina George away, but even the meanest of people can be hilariously mean. The film is a melodramatically contorted white-trash vision; not laughing would almost be rude. Matthew Bright, as cynical and clever as he is, has accomplished the rare act of making a B-movie thriller brilliant in its tackiness. Witherspoon and Sutherland have never been so enthralling.

Bright's distinctive approach is very much evident in his debut Freeway, an unforgettable spin on the tale of Little Red Riding Hood the twisted plot is extremely exploitative and suitably lurid, the characters are grossly exaggerated, the direction is lively, and even though the fairytale is known to most, I'll wager you've never seen it told quite like this.Reese Witherspoon plays white trash juvenile delinquent Vanessa Lutz, who, after her streetwalker mother (a hilariously OTT turn by Amanda Plummer) and crack-head stepfather are arrested, escapes from her social worker to go looking for her grandmother up North. En route, Vanessa experiences car trouble, but is aided by good samaritan Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland), who offers her a lift. What Vanessa doesn't realise is that Bob is the serial killer who has been slicing up hookers on the I-5 interstate, and he plans to do very bad things to her (AFTER he's killed her, of course!); unfortunately for Bob, Vanessa is more than capable of protecting herself.What follows is a darkly humorous tale full of surprises, memorable characters, extreme violence and great performances, not just from Witherspoon and Sutherland, but also from an excellent supporting cast that includes Dan Hedaya, Brooke Shields and Brittany Murphy. The film also benefits from a quirky score by Danny Elfman that suits the demented material perfectly. Any film that features the star of 24 with a messed up face and a poop bag, and the star of Legally Blonde hiding a makeshift knife up her holiest of holies is easily worth a 9/10 from me.

As usual, I had no idea what this was about. Read no reviews or blurbs. It was in my pile of possible neo-noirs.The writer-director is Matthew Bright. He did a tremendous job. Lead actress and protagonist carrying the movie is Reese Witherspoon, whom I apparently have seen before in American Psycho (another great film), but I had no recollection. At any rate, she was terrific playing a teen (Vanessa Lutz) from the underclass or lower class, the white trash portion of it. Her mom's a whore. Her step-father a drug addict who keeps trying to molest her. They get arrested and she takes to the freeway to go to Stockton to stay with her grandmother. The plot is Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf is Kiefer Sutherland (Bob Wolverton) who is a serial killer and sexual pervert.This is a comedy, mind you, filled with funny situations, repartee, satire, stereotyping and political incorrectness throughout. Her mom and dad, for example, are not evil people and Vanessa loves her mom. That doesn't stop them from all sorts of unrestrained behaviors that polite people like me in the middle or now perhaps upper-middle class would never dream of displaying. But it's also a serious crime story. So it will be called black comedy and qualify as some branch of neo-noir I suppose. A very creative branch.Vanessa is not an evil girl at all. She matter-of-factly accepts her situation, but she's not into drugs or crime. She has a very consistent sense of right, wrong and people. What she does is her own business as long as she does not aggress against anyone and minds her own business, which she is always attempting to do. If someone intrudes on her, assaults her, threatens her physically, she defends herself vigorously. The system intrudes on her at various points, trying to place her in a foster home and at one point jailing her. If someone insults her or displays hypocrisy, she comes back at them with some terrific verbal jabs that lays them bare. It's a pleasure to hear her verbally tear into them. She's not politically correct, and authority means nothing to her, her experiences having been all negative. I loved it when she described all the guards and personnel at the women's jail as perverts and wondered who in his right mind would ever take such a job or want to do it. Unfair remark? Yes. But does it have a grain or more than a few grains of truth to it? Yes. There's an awful lot of police excess and brutality these days.Although Vanessa's family is stereotyped, she is not. She stands up well as a highly moral (in a libertarian sense) representative of her class. It's authority figures and the sanctimonious hypocrites in the middle class that come in for a roasting in this movie.When her car breaks down, Wolverton picks her up, playing all helpful and well-mannered, seeking her trust. There will be a contest between these two, as one can guess. No need to say more.Hypocrisy and lying are natural features of society and government. Ripping the veils off serves a psychological purpose. Satire and comedy are legitimate ways to do this. A movie like this does it.

Well, I don't know what possessed him to imagine he was going to make too many Hollywood friends with this mighty chunk of wild and anti-establishment, two fingered spout of anger, but it is enormous fun to watch.

Far away from being intelligent like Coen's films Freeway comes to amaze us with bringing the story of Little Red Riding Hood in a different environment with many violent and funny situations.Reese Witherspoon plays the troubled Vanessa, a girl whose mother and stepfather were arrested, and she doesn't want to go to foster care or similar, deciding instead on going to her grandmother's house, the only place she can go. This Little Red Riding Hood won't bring cookies to grandma, and she's not so innocent like the old tale, here's a girl with lots of problems and lots of anger too after meeting her Big Bad Wolf, Bob a friendly psycho killer (Kiefer Sutherland) who picks her up on the road after her car broke. What comes after it's a hilarious and twisted story about two figures that don't know how to get rid of each other, in a plot that involves murders, juvenile prison for girls, a funny trial, punchlines in the wrong time to make us laugh all the time.It's not for everyone's tastes, it's certainly that not everyone will find the story funny as a comedy instead of a ridiculous way as the plot might suggest. It's full of surprises, very uncompromising and has some interesting performance from Witherspoon as the talking/smart/violent/Christian girl who manages to survive the whole ride meeting creepy characters on the way, and a nice performance from Kiefer playing the friendly guy who ends up being a killer trapped in his own evilness, after the girl shoot him several times, and this guy for some reason doesn't die but keeps living a painful life after. The scenes with both in the car, talking about her problems and he's playing the good listener was very good, and sometimes I wish that the whole movie would be focused on them doing this because it was interesting so these two change to each other the way they act, talk and all, but then we would have a dramatic feature, something that this film is not. How come one stumble upon this film? Simple! Of 5 films credited on IMDb you'll see in 4 random titles the suggestion for this film, and I gotta recognize that the promotion is a little bit over-the-top but it made me curious to watch it, and it turned out to be a great film.

Unlike the trashy in-name only sequal Confessions Of A Trickbaby (based on Hansel & Gretel), Freeway doesn't lower itself to gratuitous nudity but instead focuses on the characters and the story -- and still maintains a great sense of outrageousness.  So, to that reviewer on IMDb that wanted more skin, you have to realize this film wasn't made just for you. If you want to satisfy your need for bare breasts, there are plenty of other avenues for that.  As gritty as this film already is, turning into a bad Roger Corman women-in-prison breast-fest flick would have just lessened the legitimacy it has.Besides the clever concept, the choice casting is perfection.  Reese Witherspoon wowed me first with The Man In The Moon, and for me her role as Vanessa in Freeway is her best to date.  She is definitely one of the finest actresses around and has an incredible talent for displaying emotion and facial expressions.  The one scene in the car with Kiefer Sutherland where she is pouring her heart out is astounding -- even Bright mentions on the commentary that she manages to have so many believable expressions within one segment. (I still giggle every time I see her make that twinkling smile in Legally Blonde after talking about Days Of Our Lives and also saying I object!).  Kiefer Sutherland is so menacing without having to outwardly act like a maniac, and the rest of the cast including Brooke Shields (seeing her cuss out the cop is a gem), Dan Hedeya, Conchata Ferrel, Amanda Plummer, Michael T. Weiss.....it just couldn't have been done better!  For trivia fans, look for porn star Kitty Foxx as Vanessa's grandmother!!  And apparently director Bright had a field day doing all the girls' hairstyles himself!  Now every time I see a certain profile shot in one scene of Reese I laugh because Bright endearingly referred to her in that scene as Tweety Bird.Funny and unsettling all at once, Freeway guarantees not to disappoint those with an open mind.  Those who think no character in this film has redeeming value hasn't thought about the histories of each one, particularly Vanessa.  She's quite complex and quite angry, but you understand where she's coming from and root for her all the way.  Freeway has one of THE most memorable lines in film history  look for when she forces a john at gunpoint into a car trunk and he tells her he's claustrophobic -- just listen for her response!  It will make your day! And I've never been more terrified when I heard her say Do you accept Jesus Christ as your lord and saviour?Obviously this film is not for all tastes and it's downright rough, but what an experience it is and such a great display of talent from all involved.  I've heard some people say they wouldn't buy a film on home video because they can't understand why you'd want to watch a film more than once, even if you liked it.  That's a shame, because true gems like Freeway offer so much with each viewing that goes beyond entertainment.  See for yourself, you won't forget this one! It's astonishing, shocking, brilliant, scary, and funny!  Little Red Riding Hood will forever NEVER be the same!

These elements are woven into a dense plot and you're never quite sure who's the victim and who's the offender.Troubled teenager Vanessa Lutz (Reese Witherspoon) gets picked up on the Freeway by Bob Wolverton (Kiefer Sutherland) after her car has broken down. We soon find out that the esteemed psychologist Wolverton has some sick problems of his own, as during the drive he performs a brilliantly acted session of mental sex on the frightened teenager, pretending this to be a new sort of therapy form. As Vanessa snaps under the mental strain, we get the first reversal of roles, as she brutally strikes back on Bob.What follows is a story of dark comic horror with exquisite details that made me chuckle, despite the gruesome events. Kiefer for example is a German word meaning jawbone and, let me tell you, there are some very BAD things happening to Bob Wolverton's jawbone in the course of events. This was most probably unintentional, but I thought that to be funny anyway. The story then depicts the trial of Vanessa, her time in the women's prison and her evasion back onto the road to find her grandmother.The story cumulates in a trailer park where Girl, Grandmother, Wolf and Hunters meet for the final climax, which is a real heart-stopper.If you're looking for action, black humor, psychological terror and gore, this is the movie to watch, because it treats you with subtle doses of all of it.If you ever wanted to know how Brooke Shields' brain looks on white tiling, go get the movie!

You might Reese Witherspoon was just another actress after seeing her in fear. Here she proves us dead wrong. I must admit I had an admiration for her electric and brave, really showing us what this actress is capable of. Freeway pretty much starts off as something serious, but it becomes a twisted sort of comedy, where you're guaranteed quit a few laughs, mainly by Witherspoon. But there's a dramatic and ugly side to the movie as well. Reese lives with her junkie whore mother (Plummer) and her stepfather (Michael T Weiss), the more impressive out of the two here. They're a dysfunctional family, and you can pretty much guess what the stepfather does, regarding the daughter, Reese, great eye candy. With only option, when facing another incarceration in a foster home, after her folks f..k up, she flees from her Social worker (a familiar face) and soon meets a nice guy stranger (Sutherland) who happens to be a notorious nutter who's disposing of young girl's bodies. Although it's a very addictive watch, what I got off Freeway, I think was a shortness of story, or more to the point, it really didn't know what kind of film it wanted to be. Nonetheless, twisted films are great fun, and actually if you look more at this as a comedy, you might be rewarded more. There's a couple of trashy, if really stupid moments, that will have you in unbelief, Sutherland's new contorted jaw, among many. He is great, showing another evil side to him, after his preceding performance in An Eye For An Eye. Watch him in close ups. He's hairy, scary. All performances are good, where some just happened to really impress me. But this films for many a taste, but I recommend you should see it, just once, for it twisted colony.

It features interesting early direction and is co-authored and co-produced by Oliver Stone. Excellent acting and muted chemistry is provided by the two leads, the adept, self assured and self effacing, actress of my generation, Reese Witherspoon, and the strongly quiet, suitable and fitting Keifer Sutherland. The sparks were reminiscent of Connery and Bannen in Lumet's The Offence. They are also backed up by a good supporting cast. The film portrays the journey of a teenage girl to see her grandmother, along the freeway, through the woods, as a journey towards womanhood, as a journey through life. The micro in the macro. The objective is to resist the wild(e) temptation of adult intimacy and sexual encounter. Vanessa shows heightened knowledge of sexual language and simply explains to Bob his threat of sexual intercourse with her whilst drugged, brutalized or dead. She is, through the sociopathic and psychopathic Bob, shown another's desire for sexual encounter with her.She plays with and bastardizes her boundaries towards the end by promoting herself as a prostitute only to find a victim to rob and also possibly as a therapeutic method of getting revenge on the customers who are involved in the hiring and tainting of her mother.Ultimately both the evil murderer Bob and the growing, girl, Vanessa develop antisocial attitudes. With hope it can be viewed unlikely that Vanessa's will continue into her adult life, all things, including her post-story social care, going well, and Bob is killed.Vanessa's and Bob's relationship is immature and antagonistic involving damage to hair, name calling and insulting each others mothers. The restaurant scene; her at 15 with him, an adult of an age almost socially acceptable and normal to be her father. Vanessa invites empathy in a prison scene at night, sat high on her low prison bunk like a South American mummified king. In calm contemplation she shows ingenuous use of her body while wearing a figure accentuating top contrasting to her previous clothes. She is fulfilling her inheritance to become an adult woman.The soundtrack's strings are similar to Argento's classic, atmospheric Suspiria soundtrack. It is filmed well and the shot where the black Policeman finds the lock of hair is pleasant to view. A piece of bad editing is evident leading to the wife's easy-to-find-gun-in-a-bathroom suicide. A rare lumpy brain shot is shown. Bob is provided with a displacing voice box à la Scream and Alias when in picture. The star building vehicleness of the film notes to Clueless, as does Brittany Murphy's inclusion in the cast.The film ends on a break in their chaotic lives, Vanessa smoking, relieved and the Police officers, their wanted suspect dead.The magicness of Bob's survival, and other writer&/director's clues show a view of this story as Vanessa's pre-natal to old age journey, including bearing child. This is a very interesting film but still quite rough in its visualization.A mountainous duality of chariactured, or farsical in Reese's words, comedy and grave crime and debasement. Her incestous, abusive step-father laughs like a sly, evil, hyena, albeit a human intoxicated on methamphetamines, whilst being driven away again into the criminal system by the Police. Bob's psychotic smile is displayed as he nears his kill. Vanessa herself accompanied by her friend frolically prances away in her jail break after they assault and cut their female and male guards. She announces maskedly that she hasn't lost her smile whilst wrongly imprisoned even after her paradoxical accusers give a strong TV interview against her.True to being a journey film, the film is intricate in its content yet the heroine ends in a similar situation to how she started, although, the audience is shown, she has found a smile.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films.

Since it had been one of her first films and quite frankly the first time I had seen the actress before, it was a good story line and made you perhaps look differently at the perception of people. For example, even though she was from a really screwed up family situation the girl (Reese Whitherspoons character) was street smart and took matters into her own hands. Even when people explain themselves or their actions in a different way it does not make them any less intelligent. They are just a product of their environment but that person may not take on the traits expected from their environment.

Witherspoon stars as the troubled Vanessa Lutz, who after her mother and stepfather are both arrested for drugs, runs away to her grandmother's house.  En route, she meets Bob Wolverton (Sutherland), a child psychiatrist who talks to Vanessa and she tells him many of her deepest secrets.  Unbeknownst to her, Bob is actually the notorious I-5 Killer, who has murdered several young women up and down the freeway that he's picked up.  This film is not so much a thriller as it is a grim portrait of American mass media.  Freeway fits more or less into the category of films like Kalifornia and Natural Born Killers that are hell-bent on satirizing mass media and feeding our growing obsession with serial killers. It seems that the whole world is against Vanessa when her court case begins.  As a news watcher, who are you more likely to believe - a foul-mouthed trailor trash hooker-to-be or a now facially-paralyzed school psychiatrist that the girl claims to be a mass murderer?  That's the one thing I did not like about this movie, as it could have turned into one of those O.J. trials that's on every news channel on television.  (This was done in greater detail in The Cable Guy which was also released in 1996.)  In this process, it could not only prove to us our fascination with high-profile murder cases, but it could have showed us everything that is wrong with our culture, just as Natural Born Killers aimed to do.

Luckily, it's also one of the funniest. After the slow opening ends the film gradually becomes funnier and funnier right up to the last scene which features a man trapped in the boot of a car, a pensioner being shot in the chest, a naked dead granny, and Keifer Sutherland in a dress. It's probably better if you actually see it.There's been a lot of films made recently that update classics, not least the Baz Luhrmann remake of Romeo and Juliet. Freeway is a remake of that other literature classic, Little Red Riding Hood. It complies to the usual formula of these remakes - set it in the modern world, throw a lot of guns in etc - but at the same time manages to throw in some jokes about deformity and mental instability. Really, it is better than it sounds.Reese Witherspoon is excellent, Keifer Sutherland is less excellent, everyone else does their job. The girl goes to her grandma's, she meets the wolf along the way, the wolf takes the grandma's place, but Little Red Riding Hood wins out. It's such an ordinary story, but it's done in an extraordinary way that uses the car crash principle of being really gross to keep you watching.

More than an allegory, the film makes rather obvious (and often clumsy) allusions to the tale of Little Red Riding Hood beginning with the animated opening credits, lest anyone miss the point.  Midway through the story, however, the movie switches genres into the Wild Women in Prison category, before lurching back to the fairy-tale mandated conclusion at Grandma's.  It's surprisingly quite violent and bloody, and deals with some discomforting topics, but amazingly enough, it's not all that bad of a movie. Reese Witherspoon, in what was apparently her first major movie role (this was made in 1996) plays the Red Riding Hood character, with an interesting twist; she is forced to go to Grandma's when her own junkie-prostitute mother, and overly friendly stepfather are hauled off to the pokey.  On the way she is picked after her own car breaks down on the freeway up by Keifer Sutherland (who was billed as the star) whose character's name is Bob Wolverton.  Enough said there. The movie is made more interesting by some of the other familiar faces which show up along the way.  The two detectives on the hunt for the Freeway Murderer are played by the fellow who played Alicia Silverstone's father in Clueless (among other things) and the guy who played the Black Marine Sergeant Dawson defended by Tom Cruise in A Few Good Men.  An unrecognizably chubby and brunette Brittany Murphy (who also had a small part in Clueless appears as a lesbian inmate at the women's prison who takes an interest in Reese. Reese, playing a foulmouthed delinquent and part-time teen hooker is very different from the America's Sweetheart she now portrays.  She is shown to be fierce and resourceful, as well as violent, when necessary. Her very strong Southern accent (very out of place in the Los Angeles setting of the story) betrays her native Tennessee upbringing, and her early years before voice coaching; (although an off hand reference to Texas in the film attempts to address this issue).  Brooke Shields is not horrible as Keifer's unknowing wife. It's a harsh film about some harsh issues, but it's also worth a look. "},{"Title":"Sexo!

It stands out as a quick reminder of why I became so fascinated with these films to begin with, and what intelligent, important work that can actually be achieved within the genre. Mark my words, In another five years it will considered one of the finest video cult-classics of the 90s.The film is described as a retelling of that old molestation tale Little Red Riding Hood - and, great as the movie, that's pretty much all it does. What I liked about the movie though is that the filmmakers not only retold the story in a more adult way, but they also modernised it and changed the characters and plot to something that actually tells us something of our times and its problems. Something Hollywood would't touch. Little Red Riding Hood (wonderfully portrayed by Reese Witherspoon) is a bad girl trying to make it in a rotten world, and the wolf (Keither Sotherland in his only part i've liked - probably because he gets it so hard in the end) is a psycho serial killer with a taste for young girls. One thing that the film makes clear from the very first frame is that there is a sex-war going on between men and women. A war in which the freethinking, sexual and non-submissive young woman of the lower class are on the bottom of societys food chain. It could be argued that Freeway was intended as a morale-booster to these, often looked at as bad, girls. If that was the case I would support it all the way - just thinking of how insane young girls are treated in our society (that whole virginity-thing for example, or the fact that rapist can get away with it if the victim wore short skirt!) makes it clear that more films like Freeway are needed.

I have not seen much of Reese Witherspoon but I must say that this must be her most powerful performance ever. She was remarkable in this movie and played the poor troubled teen to perfection. Never overacting , she portrayed the character brilliantly , subdued and sad at times and exploding and violent at times.The movie is a beautiful modern take on the Little Red Riding Hood story. Kiefer Sutherland plays the wicked wolf and is creepy and funny. Recommended viewing if you're looking for something different than the harry potters and rings.

The script is semi-interesting but really goes downhill as the movie progresses.  Reese Witherspoon saves this film and is about the only entertaining thing to come out of it.The modern version of Little Red Riding Hood sure has changed a lot from the fairy tale version.  Whoa!  'Freeway' is basically a slow moving picture in which the cast saves it from going straight down the toilet.  The writing is boring but somehow amusing.  As much as I'd like to say that it was terribly written, I can't because it did make my laugh a whole lot.Reese Witherspoon is one of my most favorite actresses.  I'm glad that the casting directors and all, cast her in this role, which seems so unlike her (now anyway).  Being that this was her first major role in a motion picture, I was very much impressed with how she slipped into the character of Vanessa so smoothly, producing a wonderful performance.  Witherspoon is no doubt the best thing about 'Freeway'.  Kiefer Sutherland is not an actor that I'm too fond of.  I don't think that he was right for this film.  It just seemed as if he didn't want to do the project at all.  He could have been better but he could have been worse.  Who else?  Dan Hedaya has a very minor role, which is okay.  Brittany Murphy also pops up once or twice.  I guess I would have liked to have seen more of her.  Brooke Shields was alright, I suppose.  She was a little on the annoying side though.  I have to say it once more  Witherspoon is fantastic.'Freeway' is a movie that would be good to see one night (probably if there isn't anything else on).  It's a very weird but comical film that fails at times but does a pretty good job of entertaining at others.  I'm not crazy about it, but I'd see it again.

A true 'non-victim' of her background, Vanessa isheadstrong and feircely aggressive, but also intelligent andpractical.

Her parents are once again hauled off after the cops raid their residence and Vanessa is about to shack up in another foster home. Fat chance.

After a struggle, she is able to shoot him numerous times, steal his money, and get to safety. She is then arrested and charged as an adult with an attempted murder after the killer survives her shower of bullets, though grossly disfigured. Vanessa must prove her innocence or perish in prison.A great rebel flick in the style of a very grim Little Red Riding Hood, this film delivers the goods. Shocking and very funny. Intelligent despite it's juvenile subject matter, with interesting characters and perfect disposal of the uninteresting ones. It pushes past liberating women, and through an invincible female lead, liberates all characters who are oppressed and alienated by forces that may be weaker than they appear.The opening credits sequence play like a twisted reminder of the days of RUTHLESS PEOPLE and MANNEQUIN, with excellently demented music by the obscurely eclectic exultant of the film score, Danny Elfman.

She would much rather leave then get put with another family, so she chains the probation officer (Conchatta Ferrell) to her bed and makes a run for it. The irony comes in, right before she enters the freeway, of the brief encounter with her gang member boyfriend which turns into a sacrifice. (won't say what happens.) When her car breaks down on the freeway, she's picked up by a clean-cut counselor (Kiefer Sutherland) for troubled kids who is actually a rabid serial killer just warned about on the news. What we didn't know before is that Vanessa is much smarter than you imagined (not the blonde hick portrayed at the begining) and more insane than the monster who she gets into a warpath with throughout the rest of the movie. Executive-produced by Oliver Stone, the film has a John-Waterish look to it for the acting, campy sets, gratuitous violence and sexual inuendos.

Kiefer Sutherland is equally good, giving as greasy a performance as ever was of a smooth, unctuous predator. Witherspoon is Cassandra-like; sure, she tries to execute Sutherland, shooting him in the neck and face, and twice in the back...but no one listens to her when she tells them he's the serial killer they're all looking for. And she doesn't particularly care. Captured, accused, she lashes out at everyone. She is prosecuted, while Sutherland is presented in the media as a victim. Witherspoon taunts the now terribly-disfigured Sutherland hilariously in court--Hey chipmunk-face!--convincing everyone that she is an unpenitent sociopath.Violence becomes Witherspoon's means of survival, and she isn't squeamish. In jail, she fashions a makeshift knife by melting plastic wrap around a toothbrush, melting it, and then sharpening the plastic. With this, she slashes a guard during an outing.

Reese Witherspoon plays Vanessa, the modern Red Ridding Hood, who is the type of girl you would see on Jerry Springer (as the film begins she is struggling to read the sentence The cat drinks milk). Kiefer Sutherland plays Bob Wolverton, the big bad wolf.After her mother and stepfather are taken to jail for being just too darn sleazy, Vanessa handcuffs her social worker to her bed and steals her car to go to her grandma's trailer. She isn't sure if her grandma is going to accept her with open arms, after all, her mother did throw acid in her face. When her car breaks down on the freeway she is picked up by the seemingly nice Bob. 	Bob at first seems to be generally concerned about Vanessa, but this is Kiefer Sutherland we're talking about here. We know that it's just a matter of time before he attacks her and he does.  Up too this point I thought I knew where this movie was going, but the result of Bob's attempt to murder Vanessa sends the movie into an entirely different direction. A modern Red Ridding Hood would have to be a force to be reckoned with, especially if she came from a poor white trash background. There are more big bad wolves these days then there were in Grimm's time. What's good about Freeway is how it has all the elements of the fairy tale but it's crossed with a satire of true crime stories. I especially liked the way the actors stayed completely in reality even when faced with the most absurd situations. Kiefer Sutherland is stuck with an odd grimace for the second half of the movies and he also has to smoke through his throat. Reese Witherspoon encounters such events as coming home from school to see her mom outside their motel room turning tricks, getting told to respect her stepfather because he spent all day standing in line getting rent vouchers, and later a female inmate in a juvenile detention center tries to make out with her. And both actors maintain believability throughout. If you are a fan of over the top humor then Freeway is definitely one for you to watch.

So, now 5-6 more times later (I need to buy the thing) I know alot about it, and still find it clever, creative and amusing.This is a trash movie to the max which is too clever for its own good.  Of course this is a parody.  It is definately over-the-top, but depending on your tolerance level, it never goes too far.  (The sequel tried to offend, went too far, made it seem like they were trying to offend, and just bored).  The script is clever, with a sign for the start of the movie (Freeway entrance) the middle of the movie (just pull over bob) and the end (I think that's our exit).  Also, after her boyfriend, Chopper is killed there is a sign next to the freeway entrance sign that says no motorcycles allowed.  Also, the basket, and the name Bob Wolverton were nice touches.The plot is great, I mean who doesn't know Little Red Riding Hood, yet the movie comes up with surprises.  And, nothing is taken seriously.  It is sure to offend people, but to those of us who are hardly offended (attack those who should know better, or deal better) this is a great movie.  Not for all tastes, a must see for those that fit.  This is indeed one of the funniest dark comedies ever made.  The performances are just this side of brilliant.

I saw it for the first time last night, luckily I taped it, and I watched it again three times today.In the beginning we are introduced a bunch of character, although only one of them will remain in the picture. That is, of course Vanessa, played by Reese Witherspoon (Election, Pleasantville), who is so adorable I could just lay down and die. Then there's her mother, played by Amanda Plummer (God's Army, Pulp Fiction), her stepfather Michael T. Weiss (The Pretender, Days Of Our Lives) and her boyfriend Bookem Woodbine (The Rock, The Big Hit). Who all do a great job, although they only appear in the movie for one or two scenes each. This is one reason I love Freeway so much the supporting actors. We also bump in to two of my personal favorites, Alanna Ubach (Clockwatchers, Denise Calls Up), and Brittany Murphy (Clueless, Girl, Interrupted). The latter being absolutely flawless as a smack-abusing, paint-sniffing, lesbian weirdo. Plus, they're both really hot. Which is not a disadvantage in any way. And don't forget to watch out for Susan Barnes, the queen of cameos, as Mrs. Cullins.Later on, enter Kiefer Sutherland as Bob Wolverton, a wolf in sheepish clothing. Since this is, sort of, a version of Little Red Riding Hood, you need one of those. I used to like Kiefer quite a bit, but then I was unfortunate enough to watch Frankie The Fly, and that was that. Mankind has seldom witnessed a performance which lacked so extensively in presence, credibility, and not to mention talent. But he actually does a good job here. There is hope after all.And also Watch Reese Witherspoon as she walks to the car with the basket in her hand, right after handcuffing the social service woman to the bed. She looks EXACTLY like Little Red Riding Hood did in the cartoon she and her stepfather were watching earlier. Very nice little detail there.So, finally, all I can say is if you haven't seen this film, do something about it. If you don't, you'll regret it.

She somehow takes a cartoon-like character and makes her into a multi-dimensional person that you care about and sympathize with. All of her scenes are priceless, especially her scenes with Keifer Sutherland as the big bad wolf (this is a Little Red Riding parable, after all). If you have not seen this film, please go do yourself a favor and rent it asap. (There is violent content for those who are sensitive to it) It is truly a dark comic masterpiece!

This movie has enough verbal carnage and just plain far out stuff in it that I had to watch it about 3 times!! I mean it`s better than any Jerry Springer show. First I must say Reese Witherspoon was great in this movie and played a big part in the review value of this film (which I think will someday be a cult classic) I don`t think any other girl could have played the naughty yet very nice and sexy Vanessa Lutz as good as she does!! The part that made this film entertaining is watching the life of a BAD GIRL type played by Witherspoon. I don`t want to make Sutherland and Shields feel left out of this review but Vanessa Lutz steals the show!! Anyway this is the most I have ever written about a B movie so check this movie out and you`ll find out why, This is not the kind of movie you watch with your mother!! keep in mind my rating is based on how good the movie actually is over a long period of time not how good it is as a cult classic (4 stars).

Reese Witherspoon plays an illiterate state-raised teenager with a Ph.D. in street smarts.  Her nemesis, Kiefer Sutherland, plays a university-educated pillar of society with a few hidden bad habits.  Their lives intersect on the road to grandma's house and a no-holds-barred contest between two remorseless antagonists takes off from there.Nothing is soft-pedaled in this film.  Child abuse, vicious fights, and murder all take place in an environment where they appear commonplace.  Every character is drawn with an eye towards basic humanity rather than good or bad.  Vanessa Lutz knows the system as well as the folks running it.  Anyone feeling smug or superior to her is usually in for a rude awakening.  The only virtues lauded are that no one has a right to treat another badly without repercussions and that respectability is in the eye of the beholder.The acting in this film is terrific.  Both Reese Witherspoon and Kiefer Sutherland give insightful performances and the supporting performances are generally low-key and believable.  The comedy is in the contrast between real life on the streets and the middle-class bureaucratic dreamland portrayed on the evening news.  Witherspoon's Vanessa Lutz has a long juvenile record including theft arson prostitution and attempted murder, but comes across as openhearted and innocent.  She had to use a lot of empathy and intelligence to make her character as interesting and as full-bodied as she was.

Freeway succeeds as the thriller it was advertised as, but upon closer inspection, viewers will find a strong dose of black comedy to go along with a scathing indictment of dysfunctional adults, and their roles in the wayward lifestyles that youths often adopt.

This low IQ girl is so innocent and so easy to be played in the palm of that f***ng sick psychiatrist, that really had made me feeling worried. But she is not a weak lamb waiting for the wolf to eat, she is more like a beautiful female kight who hate the wicked people so much, fight  with them so bravely, never give up and always win surprisingly and smartly. I am fond of this characater very much. She is seemingly a rather mad girl, but actually not. In the all, she is a kindhearted girl, with a true love to her black boyfriend, a sincere friendship with her prison mates(what perhaps is amazing is that she even be so helpful to admit the lesbian girl to hug and kiss her) and cheerful nature to face all the difficulties and mock the bad persons joyfully(I had felt sorry that I-5 was still alive first, but then when I saw the plot of the court  I found that her mock is a more powerful penalty than death to him).And the other role the wolf, I think, is not just simply the person called Wolverton who use his special knowledges to manipulate and play other people's thinking and emotion.  It also, in a way, include all the unreasonable things prevent the innocent girl back to her grandmother, like the foster home, the court and the prison which didn't fulfill the justice, and the two detectives who first didn't care about her at all and just wanted to make use of her for the case, and who didn't do any real investgation either just until the black one found the girl's friend was also black. They all somehow hurt the girl on her way to her grandmother. And all these things that reflect flaws of the society make this film thoughtful.This is the first film of Reese Witherspoon I saw.  Though at first her countenace really made me feeling a little weird, but after that, I had found I was naturally captived more and more deeply by the role's fascinating personality and Witherspoon's wonderful performance. And when she wearing that pink garment interviewed with that two detectives, her impressive beauty had conquered me thoroughly and made me a fan of her.In fact this is also the only movie of her I saw.

Long before she became a household name with LEGALLY BLONDE, Reese Witherspoon turned in an extraordinary performance in this darkly humorous semi-fairy tale/road-trip gone bad.Somewhere down around the Mexican border in the SoCal desert live what many people call garbage people, poor white trash who live in sleazy motels, turn tricks for drug money, and raise children that will no doubt learn nothing but how to follow in their parents' footsteps.One such child, Vanessa Lutz (Witherspoon), barely a teenager, has a lot stacked against her. Her mother (Amanda Plummer) is a raging crack-head and hooker, selling herself just a few yards away from the motel. Dad Larry (Michael T. Weiss, totally unrecognizable) is a doper too, and while Mom is out earning the cash, he's molesting young Vanessa.Baby faced Vanessa (Witherspoon has a head shaped almost like Tweety Bird's) has also already been arrested several times herself for arson, vandalism, stealing, and most disturbing of all, prostitution. She cannot read, and is enrolled in a special school with other disadvantaged teens in her neighborhood. One day, just as Vanessa has come home from school, her mother is busted for drugs and prostitution. Mom and Larry are both hauled away quite abruptly, and suddenly Vanessa is faced with the usual grim situation foster care. Unable to stand the thought, she manages to trick her social worker and escape in the family junker, heading to the city of Stockton in northern California, where a grandmother she's never even met might be living. She doesn't get far before the POS gives out, and a good samaritan named Bob Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland) stops to assist her.Indeed a twisted twist on the story of LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD, complete with a big, bad wolf, FREEWAY is filled with wonderful actors, unforgettable characters, disturbing images, foul language, and a very unexpected, unlikely heroine in Vanessa. At first glance, she's what many would wave off as just a regular troubled juvenile delinquent. Illiterate, despoiled, damaged beyond repair, with nothing in her future except drugs, welfare, kids with different daddies, multiple arrests, prison time, and so on. A lost cause with no redeeming qualities at all, but suddenly, face to face with pure evil, Vanessa becomes this hero. She refuses to allow the evil to continue, and in a strange mixture of compassion and absolute certainty that this must be done, makes the difficult decision to execute Mr. Wolverton, the man she once believed was decent and kind.And she completely got me with her prayer afterward. It was unlike anything in any movie I'd ever seen before. This kid who has just made a brutal decision to kill someone kneels down and prays, for forgiveness? For guidance? For something she can't even name? It's indescribable. Suddenly Vanessa Lutz becomes this beautiful soul, and you're rooting for her from that point on.I'm sure many critics and viewers could not look past the unpleasant qualities of this film to see the morality tale being told, but I saw it. To this day, it is my favorite Reese Witherspoon role and film. The incredible cast includes Dan Hedaya and Wolfgang Bodison as two detectives puzzling over the case and seeking the truth, Brooke Shields as a wife in painful denial, and an amusing Alanna Ubach (who later played Witherspoon's cheerleader pal in LEGALLY BLONDE) as a Latina gang-banger/killer Vanessa meets in a juvenile facility.It still gets an A+ from me.

The direction by Matthew Bright is cutting edge and quite in your face, leaving little room for subtlety. And with this material, no other style could've worked. The acting is also great. Reese Witherspoon is revelatory as the white trash girl with more smarts than it initially appears. Along with Election and Walk the Line, this is the best performance from an extremely talented actress who often gets stuck with tripe (such as Legally Blond). Kiefer Sutherland is watchable as usual, creating a surprising degree of sympathy for such a psychotic and sickening character.

Like most dark and realistic movies it was way under rated by *Critics*. Maybe we should hire more critics that actually watch movies that step outside the box because I don't need a movie to be a billion dollar blockbuster for me to want to see it.

I try to revisit this one once every few months cuz I get such a kick out of it. I honestly can't find a single flaw in this film, and I'm not one to hand out 10's generously...FREEWAY is a f!cked-up retelling of the LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD story - a white-trash teen (played absolutely BRILLIANTLY by a young Reese Witherspoon...) runs away from home (and the law...) when her mother is busted for prostitution. When her car breaks down, a seemingly kind stranger (also portrayed brilliantly by Keifer Sutherland) gives her a lift. The kindly stranger turns out to be not-so-kindly...and the whole film goes to hell from there.FREEWAY is honestly a flawless film. The performances by everyone in the film are absolutely top-notch and dead-on. I'm not even that much of a Reese Witherspoon fan, but she is so perfect in this film that she should have won a f!cking Oscar. She is so lovable as the scrappy, loud-mouth, sh!t talking, dirty-fighting, naive Vanessa Lutz that she radiates from the screen. Sutherland as Wolverton is believable in his dual roles of confidant/psychopath and the interaction between the two is a pleasure to behold. There are cameos and supporting roles played by all sorts of pretty big names, including Brooke Shields, Amanda Plummer, Bokeem Woodbine, Brittany Murphy, Guillermo Diaz, and Dan Hedaya - and they all absolutely shine in their respective parts. All that being said...FREEWAY is not a film for everyone - it is a times shocking, completely un-PC, vulgar, and violent...but all of this is handled with such a truly hilarious dark sense of humor that almost everything that goes on in the film elicits a laugh. Again, this film may not be for everyone, but if you are a sick bastard that can appreciate more subversive cinema...check this one out at all costs!!! Especially since you can find this one in the $5 bin at a lot of stores. One of the best $5 I've ever spent - and honestly one of my all-time favorite films.

Today, it's a rare and precious commodity; a B-picture that one often cannot find at most rental chains. Freeway is on one hand a definite mid-90s post Pulp Fiction picture; with its heavy SoCal desert ambiance, colorful language, and delirious plot. But on the other hand, it's a film that rose well above the muck of those typically awful films released during that era. Reese is nothing short of extraordinary as Vanessa Lutz. Sort of a young version of Amy Sedaris' Jerri Blank, Vanessa turns tricks, is,in a sense, illiterate, and can kick butt with the best of them. When Mama and step-daddy get pinched by the fuzz, Vanessa hightails it out of there. She runs into Bob Wolverton, played by the first-rate Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland, a kind of reserved actor like his father, cuts loose here with a wonderfully unrestrained and loopy performance as the wolf. He's all self-conscious psychobabble whose only intent is to lure unsuspecting and trashy girls to their death. Vanessa is no ordinary girl though.Great performances all around. Amanda Plummer and Michael Weiss are terrific as Vanessa's ne'er do well parents. Alanna Ubach, years before she played Serena opposite Reese in the Legally Blonde movies, is perfect as Mesquita. Brittany Murphy is fun as the nymphomanical heroin addict who lusts after Vanessa. Brooke Shields is wonderfully over the top as Bob's patrician wife, and Dan Hedaya is great as the cop who is the only person who supports Vanessa.This is an excellent picture, seek it out!P.S. Looking back, this film fits well into Reese's middle part of her career, after she was a wonderful child actress and prior to her becoming one of Hollywood's leading ladies. She is still a wonder to behold; one of our absolute best actresses. Sadly though it appears that she has kind of gone away from making the truly memorable films she made from 1994-2000. For those few years she had a fearlessness to her that makes one (especially when comparing her career then to her work now) stand up and take notice. This is no Elle Woods or, even Melanie Carmicheal and certainly no Becky Sharpe or Cecily. This is a character who is trailer trash through and through, played by an actress who just didn't give a darn. It's quite remarkable.

As the film progresses, Witherspoon's character, Vanessa, becomes ever more violent and unpredictable, while Sutherland's character, Bob the killer, becomes comically pitiful, and almost even sympathetic. The backstory of the film is dark, violent, and depressing, but the film itself is often quite funny. It's the kind of film that makes one laugh out loud, but then look around guiltily to see if anyone heard you.

Now granted, I had not seen the film in eight years, but I had fond memories and I could even remember the Roger Ebert/Gene Siskel show giving the film a recommendation back when movie reviews actually meant something.  So it was therefore without fear that I challenged my friend (let's call him &#145;Jim' to protect the guilty) to rent Freeway after we discussed one day how much we enjoyed films that were two blocks away from norm. Three days later, there was a threatening phone call and a doll looking very much like me with a pin in its back hanging from my mailbox.  I knew at that moment, that maybe I had made a mistake, and I purchased Freeway at the local DVD Warehouse to reacquaint myself with what has now become a friendship speed bump.Freeway stars Reese Witherspoon and Keifer Sutherland in an updated version of the Little Red Riding Hood tale.  Reese plays Vanessa Lutz, a young misguided teenager who sets out to meet her grandmother after police bust her mother and stepfather for drug possession and soliciting.  While on the run from social services, Vanessa meets Bob Wolverton (Sutherland) who offers her a lift after her can breaks down on the high way.Bob comes across as a sweet guy.  A counselor for boys who offers sound advice and really seems to care.  But as we all know in Hollywood, that is too good to be true.  Just when Bob seems to gain the trust of Vanessa, he becomes increasingly agitated and violent.   Vanessa relies on instinct and reaches for a gun given to her by her fiancé and shoots Bob.  Four times.As Vanessa goes to juvenile hall awaiting a trial, she finds out that Bob didn't die.  Bob made his way to a local hospital and although saved from the big cloud in the sky, Bob is a hideous self with a deformed face and electronic voice box.The movie then follows Vanessa as she violently escapes from jail and runs to her grandmother's house where Bob is in hiding a la the fairy tale.  So with the police in hot pursuit it becomes a cat and mouse game that explodes with gunfire at a nearby trailer park.So the movie was over, and quite frankly, I liked it even more the second time.  The violence was ever present and the language (the movie was originally NC-17 due to it's explicit dialogue) was like a power drill to the forehead.  No cuss word was left out.  From A to Z, Reese Witherspoon spoke more profanity than in the rest of her filmography combined. Upon my second viewing, I wondered if Reese Witherspoon has ever been challenged as much as writer/director Matthew Bright pushed her here.  She ends up pulling off someone who can be very kind hearted, yet has a temper this side of Hannibal Lector.  Kudos also to Keifer Sutherland who is no stranger to playing the weird unlikable characters.  In Bob Wolverton, he gives us a creature that is so heinous and hideous that you will add this to your memory banks along with The Lost Boys and Stand By Me, whenever someone mentions his name.  I was also reintroduced to actors that I had forgotten contributed to the greatness of this independent.  Dan Hedaya (Cheers), Amanda Plumber (Pulp Fiction), Brittany Murphy (Don't Say A Word) and Brooke Shields are just some of the talent that cross our viewing paths throughout this odyssey. So now that it was over, I wondered where I lost Jim on the road to acceptance.  Was it the time the teenager was describing in detail having oral sex with her stepfather?  Was it the scene when Bob tells her he is going to have sex with her after he kills her?  Maybe it was when Vanessa walks into a local diner covered in Bob's blood or we first see Bob after his attack with one eye gone and his head stuck between four spikes resting on his shoulders.    Who knows?  All I can write is that after viewing Freeway eight years later, I offer no apologies.  The movie is brisk, violent and profane.  I liken it to a Tarantino wet dream, and I would recommend it again no matter what the cost.P.S.

In stead of becoming pathetic or hateful, this girl takes it all in with a lightness, becomes self-empowered and somehow manages to come out seemingly unharmed. Is this a tribute to girlpower? However unrealistic her reaction may seem, the actress does a great job. Her seemingly untouched and carefree attitude and also the over the top, exaggerated performances of the other actors/actresses gives the movie a lightness and makes all the horrible stuff that actually happens in this movie bearable and even funny. Without loosing its impact.The story is told as a parody on today's society and justice system, it has great actors and actresses.

The ending credits were really bad and fake-looking as well, so maybe both were replaced in the Indonesian version, not sure, but it also is so bad throughout, perhaps the entire movie was replaced? While watching this, my friends and I were almost certain the actor credits were fake and that it was filmed by a group of amateur film-makers (as it was so utterly badly made - I was certain it was made in Indonesia or other Foreign country and was meant to make fun of the West), until Keifer Sutherland showed up and we were fairly certain it was him. Was this a straight-to-video movie? It was just so badly made and badly acted even for a dark comedy. Just because it is a comedy doesn't mean you have to act as if you are playing around with the script and not saying the lines in any way that makes sense.The acting was so disturbingly over-the-top bad, the accents annoying and ridiculous throughout (sounded mostly like hillbillies from the more isolated areas of Kentucky - yet supposedly was taking place in California), and the actors themselves looking so awful in every way possible (even Brooke Shields looked as if they used CGI to warp her body into something not quite human in that weird sailor outfit - again unless our copy was tampered with), I'm certain this was MEANT to be a farce/comedy, especially with the ludicrous climax regarding the actual Little Red Riding Hood story - which kind of added insult to injury - how could any writer be THAT ridiculous? Obviously it wasn't meant to be crime drama or anything like that, even though the premise suggested it was drama. It does have an overwhelming quickly made television movie and print every first take feel.So it appears that this movie (or a version of it) WAS released in the USA (not sure about here in Australia) after all? I'm still fairly certain our copy was tampered with (especially the ridiculous looking and sounding opening and ending credits - that were in static-ridden Foreign-sounding music and in mono - which wouldn't meet even the lowest standards these days), as nothing could be that badly made and be released. Most of us thought that it was one of those experimental films that was made especially for places like Indonesia and never placed directly in the actors' credits, and which wasn't released elsewhere, but seeing the information on IMDb is quite stunning in its implications about the general populace...

Reese Witherspoon is very funny as Vanessa Lutz, a semi-literate teen who's got a whore for a mother and a lecherous junkie for a stepfather. By the way, Vanessa was faking that she couldn't read The cat drinks the milk in the opening scene just to make fun of the not entirely bright teacher. She's a home girl who can kick Major Buttski along with any celluloid hero, doing here a nice variation of a Bridget Fonda-like La Femme Nikita. She also has some admirable integrity and she's cute.Kiefer Sutherland got way into his role as a child psychologist turned serial killer. The satanic leers and psychopathic drooling on his face as he contemplates his necromantic encounter with Witherspoon was enough to curdle sweet cream. Later when he gets the appliance to hold up half his mouth, displaying buck teeth, Witherspoon calls him a chipmunk, but I thought he looked a little like Stephen Hawking after an injection of protoplasm. And Brooke Shields as his grieving, empty-headed wife was a scream. (And I did like that white skirt!) We are talking creative casting here!Director Matthew Bright takes dead satirical aim at shrinks, prison guards, cops, social workers, judges, teachers, and any other societal cogs he can find and lets Vanessa, representing the under class, choke 'em, gouge 'em, cuff 'em, shot 'em, out smart 'em, and slap 'em across the face. One gets the impression that he was getting even with some people from his early years, which is good, since there's no revenge more satisfying than to trash your tormentors up there on the silver screen for all the world to see.What I didn't like about this comedic romp through the barrios and the freeways and the institutions of SoCal Land was all that blood and nary a bit of skin.

Although none of the performances are all that impressive, there is no other chance you will ever get to see Reese Witherspoon as a reckless hillbilly hooker piece of trash, or Kiefer Sutherland as a deformed sexual predator who talks through a creepy voice box.The movie starts slow then all of a sudden blasts off into a fast-paced, nonsensical orgy of destruction.

What it is is a send-up of the legal system and its biases, told sarcastically through a rough outline but very clearly intentional comparison to the story of Little Red Riding Hood. It goes off on tangents when it feels like it's been too long since it's filled its violence quota, but it focuses on its three very different and contrasting acts. The first act involves the Little Red Riding Hood character, in this version an illiterate southern white trash teenager with an impetuous temper and a black gun-dealing boyfriend, and her prostitute mother and her drunk, stoned and incestuous stepfather and the devastating situation caused by the legal system that provokes her to flee with her belongings (that she of course puts in a straw basket with a cloth cover over them) to her grandmother's house. The second act involves the persuasion and dangerous encounter with Bob Wolverton (...Wolverton...almost missed that one), a mild-mannered man who picks her up when her car breaks down and comes off as friendly and protective in that suave college professor sort of way. The third act involves the legal system's naive reaction and stubborn handling of the second act, and of course the strive to get to grandma's trailer home.Reese Witherspoon is actually brilliant in her uneducated but very street-smart and very temperamental role, playing her in the most convincing way you could play a role in a film like this. Kiefer Sutherland, who can play the worst of evils in his sleep, is surprisingly weak through the majority of his screen time, with the immediate exception of the hospital scene.Freeway is one of those movies that's just not found at the top of anybody's favorites list, a movie that's so inextricably what it is that it just could not be improved to a point near perfection, but it's entertaining and it takes you for a ride.

Reese Witherspoon is Vanessa, the daughter of a dysfunctional family à la Visitor Q. The father rapes her, the mother's a whore, both are on drugs, and when they get busted, she flees Child Protection Services and heads for her grandma's. Wherever she goes, trouble seems to be lurking and that's no exception when her car breaks down. Kiefer Sutherland as Bob Wolverton (get it?) stops to help and from here, things really go downhill. Freeway is enjoyable enough as a quirky dark comedy and has developed a minor cult following, though I can't honestly say I really loved it. The cast are all pretty good but Reese's faces and accent are a bit much at times (though sometimes great too). I listened to most of director Matthew Bright's commentary and the guy says a few odd things himself, almost as if he should be one of the characters in his film. Listen for yourself! For you action fans, he also says the rising shot of Reese walking into the trailer park at the end is his homage to Spaghetti Westerns, complete with a screaming theme!

OK, she's dressed in red, the bad guy calls Wolverton (get it, get it? Don't blame me, it's the director with such uninspiring creativity), ... but I wouldn't really call this a modern version of the well known fairytale.

I always have the feeling that the message in these movies is Be a bad guy, if you want to be cool 3) Movies like these (those nihilistic movies) portray shocking things (rape, murder, drugs, ...) in a very neutral way. What's up with that?! Do those directors think I don't want to shock my audience, so let's present it in a neutral way?! That's pretty dangerous.

How can viewers take this movie or Reese Witherspoon's performance seriously when the screenplay did not?  Did Ms. Witherspoon pull off a performance that her peers would have botched?  She did give a nice performance but who cares? If the movie cared, maybe I would.  Someone who eats a lot of fast food probably thinks Doritos are a nice snack.  Someone who watches a lot of TV would probably love this movie.The movie is about an illiterate girl in a poor LA neighborhood.  She's been abused by her parents, by society and by the system charged with rehabilitating her.  After wacko Bob tries to get kinky, she has her day in court...so to speak (you have to see the scene, it's quite funny).  And that's one of problems.  Are we watching a cartoon action flick like Desperado?  If so, why do we care about Ms. Witherspoon's performance?  A dozen other Hollywood indie chicks would have turned in the same work. Not to mention Christina Ricci, Alicia Siverstone, etc. etc.She goes from stupid (but with a heart of gold), halting killer to hardcore jail bitch who almost beats another inmate to death...who watches a murderof another woman and who fashions a knife in solitary to use it to slash a guard.  And then 5 minutes later the screenplay is trying to get cute again? Please.  The only excuse for this type of plot dyslexia is a) A poor screenplay or b) A parody.  I hope it's the former.  Well, it is obviously the former because murder, minor incest, drug abuse and violence--all portrayed in graphic detail--are not subjects that can be parodied to the extent they appear in Freeway.If Freeway is a parody then we ought not to mind when the movie goes cute--that'd be amusing.  But that's what happens when we as a society become desensitized to the scary bogus s**t that were seeing in our world--lest we might be offended.  I challenge the viewer who thought this movie was great to tell me on what grounds.  Tell me how did they feel the last time they were molested?  Or the last time they took someone's life? Oh, that's never happened?!  Why doesn't that surprise me.If you want funny murders, watch a dark comedy.  If you want a serious molestation flick, rent it.

It's perfectly clear where the story is going early on, yet it still takes forever to get there. When it finally arrives, writer/director Matthew Bright throws a great left turn into the plot and sets up a potentially fascinating second half of the movie. That never materializes because Bright ignores almost all of the possibilities suggested by his great idea so he can relentlessly focus on a main character who is too impervious to care about.Vanessa Lutz (Reese Witherspoon) is the 15 year old, illiterate spawn of poor white city trash. Her drug addict stepfather (Michael T. Weiss) molests her and her at-best-borderline crazy mother (Amanda Plummer) turns tricks on the street in the parking lot outside the motel room where they all live. When they get arrested, Vanessa tries to flee to the grandmother she's never met. Along the way, she runs into Bob Wolverton (Keifer Sutherland) a counselor for troubled youth who offers her a lift and some help with Vanessa's beyond screwed up life.If I tell you there's a mention at the start of the film of a serial killer targeting young girls in Vanessa's town, can you guess where her and Bob's relationship is headed? That is where it goes, though writer/director Bright waits a long time to get it there and then shamelessly foreshadows it right before it happens, as though anyone watching this movie didn't see it coming. But then he takes what you expect and completely upends it, leaving you without any clue where Freeway is going next but anxious to find out.That feeling doesn't last long because writer/director Bright takes almost all of the interesting directions his story could go and reduces them to comic relief so he can put Vanessa through her paces in an afterschool special that has no moral or message to grow on, unless that moral is bad things also happen to bad people. It's only when Freeway needs an ending that writer/director Bright abruptly picks up some of the potential he's cast aside and tries to cobble together a big finish. I'm not sure the origins of this motion picture, but what it turned out to be was a starring vehicle for the young Reese Witherspoon that went nowhere. Not because she isn't cute as all get out and doesn't do a fine job here. It's because Vanessa dominates the whole show and is a sociopath but unfortunately, she's not one of those intriguing and grandiose sociopaths. She's one of those petty, boring sociopaths who turn up in police stations every day. The movie takes great pains to spell out all the terrible things that were done to Vanessa but none of it seems to have had any effect on her. Vanessa has no depth or inner life and cruises through her horrible existence like a shark looking for the next fat seal to eat.That might not have been a problem if Freeway had become the kind of thriller suggested by writer/director Bright's very clever left turn. In plot dominated tales, it's not always necessary for characters to be relatable or even all that interesting. By essentially becoming a study of a two-dimensional character, though, the film only highlights the lack of connection the viewer can have with Vanessa.Witherspoon is good here, as is Keifer Sutherland and Brooke Shields. Brittany Murphy has an odd role as a scarred paint-huffer and Dan Hedaya and Wolfgang Bodison are fine as two detectives, though the movie can't keep straight which one of them is supposed to be the good cop and which the bad cop.In most respects, Freeway is perfectly acceptable entertainment, with reasonably good writing, directing and acting. I can't shake the feeling that it could easily have been more than that.

However, during the journey Bob starts to turn nasty and Vanessa shoots him and leaves him to die.  However, when he survives and makes it to a hospital, Vanessa is arrested and put in a juvenile jail during her trial.Having seen the hideous sequel to this film, I wasn't sure if I wanted to give the director any more of my time.  However, I had heard good things about this film and I decided that I would give it a go - maybe the sequel was a misfire.  However from the start of the film (where we see that Vanessa is about as white trash as they come) right through the lurid sexuality of the film and the cruel and unnecessary violence all through it. The plot is a very, very loose retelling of the Red Riding Hood story (in that Vanessa is trying to go to her grandmother's, oh, and she gets picked up by a guy sort of called `wolf').  However, just like the sequel it is an excuse for a bit of a roll around in a series of lurid interactions that hang together as a basic story.  While it is nowhere near as bad as the sequel, the film does just seem to be more focused on having shocking violence, language and sexuality rather than having an engaging plot, characters or any sense of value other than the appeal of being `different' - and that's why I think people seem to like it.Many comments about the film draw attention to how very different it all it is and how they were gripped by something just so very weird and unusual and I think that Bright was aiming for this very effect.  However to `like' this film simply on the basis that it is `different' would make a fool out of me. When I was a child, I thought that swearing regularly was clever and grown up - however as adults most of us see that it really isn't and we reduce our use of it and we stop trying to `shock' others.  I see this film as being the same principle - it is all about shocking and being as lurid as it can be.  Why Bright was given the chance to do this rubbish once (never mind twice!) is beyond me.  However, unlike the sequel, some of Bright's failings are covered by some reasonable performances that, although they don't make the material `good', certainly stop it being as godawful as it could have been.Witherspoon is good mainly because she is playing against type - it's not her fault that she has zero character to relate to or feel for, but her performance is still a good one.  Likewise Sutherland has nothing to work with but he does do well in the car ride with Witherspoon.  However after we see him for who he is, he spends the rest of the film just being another lurid part in the film's attempt to shock the audience into thinking it is cool.  Hedaya is OK but is hardly in it, Plummer hams up to show how trashy she can play, Woodbine is a cameo and the rest of the cast are all just there to add shock value (Murphy as a cut-up, strung out lesbian - wow, how very cool).Overall, I managed to forget the sequel and I did give this film a fair crack at being something worth my time, but sadly it is almost as bad as the sequel and it is only the slightly better cast and slightly less lurid material that stops it being as awful.  Bright comes across as someone who is still trying to shock his elders and he is mistaken if he thinks that any more than a minority of the audience will look and this and think `cool'. Like it's sequel it is a horrid little film that ignores plot, characters, dialogue, audience involvement and logic and concentrates on just being as lurid as possible. Whether it is violence, language, sexuality or general content, this is a film that wants people to call it a `cult' and say it is `different', `unique' and `cool' where really it is a piece of trash that teenagers will love but most of us will despise.

We might be attracted to a film because of cinematic excitement (`Jurassic Park'), or clever plot twists (`Sixth Sense') or an endearing actor/actress (`Runaway Bride') or notable performance (`Breaking the Waves'). But there is danger when the only reason for a film to exist is in that one attraction. Each of the examples cited is a waste of time as it relies solely on that one hook to charm dollars and attention from us.Many films are a result of this kind of Hollywood engineering. Not only is it the case that everything else that makes for a good film is ignored in such projects, often the reverse is true; the other values are deliberately compromised in order to emphasize the one bankable element. So no Julia Roberts film can EVER be watchable because every useful cinematic device is hijacked so she can earn her twenty plus million through her smile. But these one-track films are easy to spot because they bludgeon us with that one trait.In the case of `Freeway' we have a bludgeon that is at least interesting to discuss. The dynamic here is the bald fact that films are about films, almost never life. That makes them self-reinforcing and over a short period genres emerge. All genre films rely on huge expectations we bring to them; in this way, they can sustain alternative worlds without having to create them from scratch. Genres are the key tool of Hollywood engineers, and one of their engineering techniques is the so-called `genre-bender.'When a clever genre-bending technique appears, they are quick to exploit it as an attractive feature. Often, such a thing comes from fresh kids who aren't already programmed by the institution and in such cases, Hollywood prefers to have the writer direct. After all, directing an ordinary film is simple with all the support one gets and it ensures that a genre-bound director-for-hire doesn't ruin the spirit of the thing. Example `Boondock Saints.' And this.The genre-bending has to be obvious and revealed to us, so that we can marvel at how clever we as viewers are. The bludgeon here is especially thick; it pounds and pounds Red Riding Hood. Superficial selfcritical sexploitation. A Tarantino-like self-aware, self-tweaking version of `Kalifornia.' A supervillain (and justice system) done in by a white trash tart.There's a clear line between films that are tools for life and those that are attractive junk food. This is junk, with many penalties for consumption.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

Bad acting on the part of all involved. Completely RIDICULOUS characters and situations. I felt insulted watching this. When I first turned it on, I thought it might be a spooky stalker style movie, then it just got worse and worse. I thought I was watching a movie written by a bunch of high school people. One thing I can't stand are totally ridiculous scenes that would never come close to happening in real life. I also can't stand clichéd moments and fake acting. I thought Reese Witherspoon's character was laughable as were the rest. Do yourself a favor and avoid this piece of junk. "}]
