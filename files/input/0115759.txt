Look at it, you'd think it was bad. It's got the usual assortment of action movie clich√©s and conventions. The John Woo directed action scenes stretch over the top at times, there's the mentally unstable talkative nemesis and yes even one of those bombs that graces us with a digital readout. All prerequisites for movies of this type and saying all that I'd usually be complaining by now. Yet for one reason I can't. This movie entertained me. It finds a way to come together in a really enjoyably manner and I'm happy with what I got. I can't bad mouth it.Nothing got in my way of everlasting enjoyment of seeing people die, bombs going off and the baritone guitar instrumental. It just all clicks from the get-go. If your reading this you don't need me to recycle the plot summary. It's of a trivial nature. Good action, decent cast and a fun atmosphere go a long way with Travolta ultimately holding it all together. He plays his role over-the-top and delivers some fantastic lines. It doesn't hurt that him and Slater tango well neither. If Travolta attempted this movie now instead of when he did - it wouldn't work. He's done too many goody-goody roles to come back down to this. Laws of nature will not allow him to make another good movie where he plays a bad guy. Chances are anyone else than Travolta in Broken Arrow and you'd be reading a completely different review right now too. A guilty pleasure if there ever was one.

He is great at creating interesting relationships between heroes and villains, and this film is a good example.John Travolta is terrific.  Christian Slater breaks typecast by playing a nice, sane soldier doing his duty.  The love interest isn't an idiotic supermodel playing a nuclear scientist or something, but a park ranger, also doing her duty.  She is cute, earthy, and actually believable.If you want a film that will repeat every aspect of every other military adventure film you have ever seen, you will be disappointed.

If you like action movies filmed entirely in parking garages and spooky allies, then you will not appreciate the settings in this film in America's majestic West.

The plot has John Travolta as the smiling treacherous heavy, and Christian Slater as the true-blue captain in the USAF out to spoil Travolta's plot to blow up Denver with a kidnapped nuclear device. There is a cute red head thrown fortuitously together with Slater. She has nice plump lips, big blue eyes, and the tightly tailored slacks of a Park Ranger. Very nice. We watch her from below as she climbs the ladder on the side of a boxcar. There's no reason for her to be IN the movie except to have her climb boxcars, roll down sandy hills, and so on.But then there's no particular reason for ANYTHING to be in the movie. What I mean is that if you found it necessary to leave the room for a minute or two -- a knock on the door, a tug on the trigonal, whatever -- you would find that you hand't missed much when you returned. None of the characters changes in any way. There is no dialogue worth remembering. There are some unusual special effects but if you've missed one example it's okay because another is right around the corner. I particularly enjoy the scene in which the exploding bomb takes out the helicopter.I've sat through this thing three times and I am now convinced it has turned the higher reasoning centers of my brain into tofu. That's why I genuinely like it. I like it for Travolta's toothy reptilian grin, for Slater's imitation of Jack Nicholson, for the ripoffs from Indiana Jones, for the gorgeous Utah scenery, for the rocketing diesel train, Lake Powell, the redhead climbing the ladder, the fist fights, the bouncing Humvees, the civilian who proudly announces he used to be a lieutenant in the ROTC at Yale, the redhead climbing the ladder, the bodies of people who tumble in slow motion towards the camera as a fireball explodes behind them (three times), the redhead climbing the ladder.I just like it, that's all.

John Travolta overdoes the psycho routine, hamming it up when some restraint would have made for a more believable performance, but his considerable charm sees him through.  Christian Slater, an actor who hasn't impressed me as anything more than a Jack Nicholson wannabe, makes a surprisingly commendable hero.

Slater and Travolta play pilots testing a new bomber, when one of them decides to steal the missiles on board the other must begin a personal fight to stop him.As with Hard Target this is a solid enough action movie but it really could have been made by anyone, Woo's style only really comes through in a few scenes (the birds eye view of the opening boxing match, double handed gun play).  This is a shame because the action scenes only occasionally get better than average.The plot is weak and relies a lot on coincident and luck to keep things moving.  This is quite insulting to an audience because it just shows that the script writers couldn't fix the plot as a workable story and decided to try and get this past.  Travolta overplays the villain well, but perhaps overdoes the ticks and the madness a bit too much to be believable.  Slater clearly wants to be like Keanu was in Speed but doesn't convince as an action hero, Mathis is cute but that doesn't make her performance good - she pretty much a non-entity and doesn't really have much chemistry with Slater.Again a solid action movie that is OK for a Saturday night, but with the stars, the budget and a director of this calibre you can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity.

Woo got a bad reputation due to his conflicts with both the MPAA and Universal, and it took him awhile to get this one off of the ground. Woo had never worked with special effects, so he was treading into new territory. Luckily, he got two great leads, Christian Slater (soon to be in Windtalkers), and John Travolta (Face/Off). They take his direction well, and each gives a good performance. As the traditional villain's henchman, which I like to call Indestructable Villain Sidekick, Howie Long gives a good performance, and dies a good death too. I never appreciated this movie that much until watching it tonight, and I realized, this is probably the most action-packed movie in a long time. It takes only about 6 minutes to get going, and then, boom! boom! boom! Action sequence after the other, no let-down in between. This movie has plently of shootouts, explosions, and great innovative twists (kicking the rear blade of a helicopter to knock a gun out of one's hand) to make a action movie good. John Woo's cinematography, the great shared moments (the 20 dollar bill and whatnot) are what makes this one a great action movie. Another thing that makes this flick great is that it gave Woo the power to get Face/Off, his best Hollywood outing, the greenlight. I'm looking forward to Windtalkers and love all of Woo's movies.9 outta 10.

Grab on to that chair.BROKEN ARROW may be required to take a deep long breath, because when it starts, it's a ripping action-packed joy ride complete with guns, explosions, action heroes, great baddies, helicopters, jeeps, chases and all under the great helm of Hong Kong action god John Woo, here having a filed day with special effects, stunts and style. It may be off on implausibility, but you won't need much to think about once the theater gets dark. And when the theater does get dark, and the film starts, the action just keeps pouring in. Woo delivers style over substance (there's more action here than plot), but what style! This is one of the finest piece of action escapism in years, it's also one of the most stylish ones.John Travolta and Christian Slater star as two military pilots who volunteers to transport two nuclear warheads via Stealth Bomber jet. Turns out, the true reason is Maj. Deakins (Travolta), who is still in a grudge after being passed from promotion for a long time, is out to steal the two bombs and hold the for ransom. When he ejects his partner Capt. Riley Hale (Slater) and crashes the jet in the middle of the desert, Hale is out to stop his old partner from detonating the nuclear bombs if his demands of a large amount of cash is met. Samantha Mathis co-stars as a local sheriff Terry Carmichael who gets caught up in the entire mess, and ends up helping Hale out to stop Deakins from going ballistic (there are very few romantic in-turns between the two, just for the good of it).The film runs at 108 minutes, and Woo doesn't let things up. There's action here and action there. It's wall-to-wall full of action and less plot in comparison. The film's plot resembles that of the previous year's hit SPEED, which may due to the writer being Graham Yost, who also wrote that recent blockbuster hit. But who cares, both films take liberty from the DIE HARD films, and they both turned up well. In the matter of execution, this derivative affair is brought with style and pure wall-to-wall action and thrills. And, under Woo's hands, the action is done with style and freshness.Although with a large amount of violence, Woo is the kind of action who treats them like paint in his canvas. Action fans will be pleased by how who treats the heart-pounding excitement and pure action as his ballet . It's action filmdom as a form of art. Highly recommended!Rating **** out of 5.

Mathis is slightly miscast though, and should probably stick to her other hit films. Howie Long effectively plays Kelly with very little skill and no expierence, but his size helps give him on screen presence. Delroy Lindo is effective as the confident military officer, although Frank Whaley, despite being a good actor, is rather annoying in his roleAll in all if your looking for a great way to spend almost two hours, then sit down and watch this movie.

From beginning to end we are treated to pulse pounding fighter jet chases, delightfully cheesy dialogue, bone crunching man to man combat, and endless shootouts bathed in the bloody, nerve shattering glory that only the 90's could deliver. Woo brings his operatic grace out to the desert, and amongst the constant brutish blunt force trauma, his pointed touch is unmistakable. John Travolta gives a loony toons worthy performance that's so far over the top, he shatters the ceiling and blasts off into orbit, grimacing like the joker hijacking an F18. He knows he's in camp territory too, and milks it. He plays Deakins, a jaded lunatic Air Force pilot who absconds with two deadly nuclear warheads, intent on selling them to radicals. Christian Slater is Hale, his second in command, who finds himself on a warpath with Travolta as he chases him through the desert. Woo and team surgically remove any unnecessary, dragging plot lines and distill their process to one simple formula action. Furious quantities of it too, and indeed Slater finds himself constantly hopping trains, emptying clips into countless paramilitary cannon fodder and taking down helicopters he scarcely finds time to breathe. He gets support in the obligatory female lead, feisty park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis holds her own amongst the boys splendidly). Woo is an action maestro, and he unleashes a hell storm of beautifully staged set pieces and delirious fight scenes for fans of the genre to bask in. Accompanied by Hans Zimmer's thunderous, effortlessly cool score, it's a real treat. Supporting our three leads are Kurtwood Smith, Chris Mulkey, Bob Gunton, Frank Whaley, Howie Long, Delroy Lindo and Daniel Von Bargen filling out the respective genre archetypes that we love to see. It doesn't have the 007 esque class or panache of Face/Off, but it has plenty of sound and fury to slake anyone's lust for gaudy, excessively enjoyable slash and burn action that's off the rails.

The script by Graham Yost is as action packed as they come, there's loads of shoot-outs, fights, explosions, crashes, vehicular mayhem & near misses. Most people seem to think the basic story is pretty far fetched & I have to agree but it's by no means sillier than a lot of 90's action flicks like Speed (1994) for instance. What I like about it is that it moves along like a rocket & there isn't enough time between all the fights & explosions for small things like plot holes to make any huge difference. I also liked the character's here, the relationships between Hale & the sexy park ranger & between Hale & Deakins in particular, I just thought the character's & the way they were written & developed were better than the average action flick with themes like friendship & betrayed. I liked it, a lot.Director Woo knows how to turn in a decent action flick & he doesn't disappoint here, while the unmistakable style of his earlier Hong Kong films may have been slightly sterilised by Hollywood the set-pieces in his films still remain very impressive. Broken Arrow probably has more helicopters being blown up & crashing than any other single film I think I've ever seen. Some of the explosions are huge, the fights are varied & well staged & most of the action is done the good old fashioned way on set in camera with real stunt men & real explosions rather than awful CGI computer effects which have become commonplace. The only scene which really made me cringe was when Hale falls off the back of the truck & he then picks himself up, runs after it, catches it up & jumps on the back! I don't think so, the truck itself had at least a 10 second head start before we even discuss how slow it would have to have been going for Hale to physically run after it & catch it up. The violence isn't too excessive, there's not much blood in it & the violence isn't sadistic or gloating as in say a lot of Steven Seagal films.With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Broken Arrow is well made with that Hollywood polish about it, the special effects are good & there's plenty of big bangs & explosions for the money. The acting is alright, I liked Travolta (who was apparently paid $7,000,000 for this) as the villain in particular but he does come across as a bit theatrical at times, I thought Mathis was fine as the love interest although I thought Slater was a bit bland & forgettable as the hero.Broken Arrow is a great action film, it has a good cast, great action scenes, loads of explosions, better than usual character's & it moves along at a good pace.

Now, Hollywood were pounding the crap out of Mr. Woo to spit out what we know as typical Hollywood blockbusters, most of which work on a visual level but are a flop to both their studios and their fans!The first problem that hit me with Broken Arrow, was the over-rated John Travolta. This odd looking man overacts his way through this flick with pure cheese as his guide dog, that lends itself to a cartoon like bad guy for the duration.Slater actually comes across quite well, and handles the action scenes enjoyably which shows. The park ranger was okay. She wasn't anything exciting, but got stuck into her role which impressed. I for one, would have put Cynthia Rothrock in her place that would have lent itself for more hard action scenes and some kick ass moments.Overall, Broken Arrow does pass the time enjoyably enough. I'm used to real John Woo movies, and in this we get a few moments that hark back to that. My husband was yelling and jumping quite a bit with certain close calls of action, scenes of terror and such, but I had yet to get overly excited much like when I watch A Better Tomorrow or any of his other classics.Its almost like Hollywood refused to let Woo bring what he does best to the table. They say action, yes by all means, but the brotherhood and drama of his own films is what really screams Woo and we don't really see that in his Hollywood junk.Broken Arrow is fun.

The plot revolves around a duel between two Airforce pilots, Deakins (John Travolta) and Hale (Christian Slater) Deakins steals two warheads in the Utah desert while Hale teams up with a good-looking park ranger (Samantha Mathis) to stop Deakins and his sinister cohorts.I have to admit that I usually don't like mindless action flicks, like 2001's The Mummy Returns, mainly because the stories are shallow and nothing more than an excuse to string together endless absurd action sequences. For an action film to work, the story & writing have to capture the attention of the viewer, like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Terminator 2 Judgment Day, both superb examples of the genre. I was pleased when the plot of Broken Arrow pulled me in and the film took me for a good ride. No, it's not great like those other two films, but then not many action films attain their level of expertise.Roger Ebert complained that Travolta makes an unconvincing villain. Poppycock. Travolta easily owns the role, swaggering around in over-confident non-glory. He's one of those villains you both hate and enjoy to watch. Surprisingly, Slater makes a quality protagonist and believable action hero. And Mathis is just a pleasure to behold from beginning to end. Some complain that she's somehow annoying, but I feel the opposite She totally enhances the movie. How so? She's a likable and comely protagonist, pure and simple. How exactly is she annoying? She falls upon a questionable situation and reacts in a cautionary way. Once Hale wins her trust and she understands the situation it's easy to root for her. Moreover, she looks great in tight ranger pants climbing a railcar, lol. So where's the problem? There are other positives, like the great location cinematography (shot in Utah, California, Arizona and Montana); the outstanding score and the wall-to-wall fun action scenes. Unfortunately, this last positive also morphs into a negative. There are so many action scenes that you'll start laughing at the screen. I can't help but wonder how the park ranger suddenly transforms into Indiana Jones. Was she in serious training in her spare time? Also, in order to include as many over-the-top action scenes as possible the filmmakers completely omit details, like how is it that the ranger goes utterly undetected on the boat? They don't even show.But these types of things don't matter much in an action movie like this; it's all about going for a fun ride and Broken Arrow delivers the goods from most angles.The film runs 108 minutes.GRADE B "},{"Title":"I say god-damn what a rush.","Date":"27 January 2012","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":" There's no denying that in order to make it in Hollywood, John Woo had to abandon much of what made his Hong Kong films so special a unique blend of emotional characterisation combined with themes of loyalty and honour and outrageous over-the-top violence. That said, I still get a kick out of Broken Arrow, the director's second US effort the plot might be your typically dumb US action nonsense, full of glaring plot holes, but the film still displays enough of Woo's cool visual style and expertly choreographed action to make it a cut above the competition.Working with big Hollywood stars and a massive budget, Woo pulls off some ridiculously outrageous comic-book action, building to a glorious orgy of violence aboard a speeding train carrying a live nuclear device to Denver, with only fighter pilot Capt. Riley Hale (Christian Slater) and park ranger Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis) to save the day. None of what precedes this silly scenario makes much sense, but check your brain at the door before viewing and you'll have a blast with the brilliantly choreographed hyper-kinetic gun-play, impressive stunt sequences, massive explosions, and John Travolta's absolutely bonkers performance.

But I remember seeing the previews on TV, but not being able to see it in theaters because I was too young, so when it came out on video, I would ride my bike down to the video store to rent it countless times a month. Surprisingly, the folks liked it too and didn't mind me watching it over and over. At first I thought it was over the top, but I really liked the soundtrack(by Hans Zimmer, one of my favorite composers), and as I watched it more for the soundtrack, the over all experience of the movie grew on me. The theme for Travolta's character just made him the badass his character needed to be. Slaters unlikely role as the scrawny hero worked out for the betterment of the film and his character. Long's only good film appearance as the muscular right hand man fit him to the T. John Woo's affinity for action movies is exemplified in this film. Mathis's role as the female element was believable(she didn't come off as a dit and one could see her has a park ranger because her proportions weren't medically exaggerated). The shootout in the mine, the Humvee chase, the Helicopter pursuit of slater and Mathis, the opening scene with a fight in the cockpit of the stealth bomber, and the climatic train sequence made this a cool movie. So what if it wasn't Oscar material, not every movie is, and the ones that aren't are the most entertaining. I now attribute this movie as my start into movie loving and becoming a connoisseur.

That's just about the only thing I can think of by describing this masterpiece of an all American movie! This certainly qualifies under the Mindless Action catergory but in the end it plays out well. I am a die hard John Woo fan, through good and bad (though I have yet to see a bad film of his) he has always pulled through to my expectations. After a strong Hollywood debut by directing 1993's phenomenal Hard Target it was about John Woo's time to show that he has what it takes to make a big budget Hollywood action movie. And it shines through beautifully. It was obvious that in this movie Woo didn't focus a lot of his Shoot-outs that look more like a slow motion ballet that we have seen in his earlier Hong Kong films and his extraordinary Hollywood film Face/Off which would come out a year later. But to a lot of people disliked this movie because it didn't contain his certain style of gunplay really overlook the smaller things. I'll get back to those in a little bit. The plot is a relatively good one that's basic, but isn't basic enough to make us think that the writers thought that seven year old's will be viewing this movie. But this type of basic plot is seen quite often in John Woo movies because he knows that people arn't going to see his movies for top notch plots but for seeing a movie that is full of his views and beliefs about how an action movie should be made. Well anyways, the movie starts out with a boxing match between two competing United States Air Force pilots. Vic Deakins (John Travolta in a very well played out role) and Riley Hale (Christian Slater in not his best role - True Romance and The Contender take that honor - but still played out convincingly). Well by the end Hale is KO'd by Deakins and we move right into the main plot. Now I've heard many senseless babble about how the whole beginning was unnecessary and a waste of time but you have to realize that the writers and John Woo put that there in order to set up two things (1. that Deakins and Hale are tough competitors and (2. it brings in the whole significance of the $20 bill which turns up throughout the movie. Back to the plot. Deakins and Hale are ordered to fly a B3 stealth bomber on a simulation run over the Utah desert to test out it's stealth capabilities and to take a map of the terrain. But what adds on to this flight is that they're carrying two nuclear warheads in their payload. Now apparently these are some big nukes because they're described as 81's, and I'm not too keen on my nuclear weapons but apparently these are some big nukes or as Christian Slater calls them Ooooo 81's, crowd pleasers! So they both fly out in the B3 and since I don't want to spoil the plot I'll just say that one of them has an evil plan brewing involving these two nukes. WARNING! SPOILER! DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW TOO MUCH OF THE PLOT! One of them drops the nukes and ejects the other while in turn he also ejects before crashing the $2 billion aircraft. What follows is a barrage of action sequences that I feel play out well to suit the plot. There's a rush of side actors such as Delroy Lindo as the unfortunate person who has the job to find out exactly what happened that night to the two pilots and two nukes. Samantha Mathis also appears as a strong hearted park ranger who's stuck in all this mess. And unfortunately Howie Long makes his major Hollywood film debut in this movie (stick with sports casting buddy, acting's not your thing). But through the rush of side actors and action sequences we never forget what John Woo was accomplishing through this movie. You can see his gunplay really shine through during the whole underground mine sequence where bodies gracefully flit about while pumping other people full of bullets. Also I have to give him my compliments on the excellent direction and choreography through the whole final half an hour shoot-out on the train. SUPERB! Also I have to say that the final death sequence in the movie is amazingly original (I'm not saying it's plausible) it's just something you wouldn't expect and really that's what you want in a movie. What you have to realize is that John Woo has made a solid, very solid action movie here. Don't think about what he's done before, think about the movie by itself as an action movie. You can still find Woo's directorial touches to the movie. Such as the feeling of partnership between Travolta and Slater in the beginning, and the whole significance of the $20 bill. Neither of them seem satisfied with doing something unless there's a $20 down. Look deep and you can find these things and a whole lot more. Also the scenery is very beautiful throughout the whole film. The serene desert landscape with the jutting mountains painting the backdrop. I believe that the tagline is quite true to the movie Prepare to Go Ballistic which really describes how I felt upon seeing this movie. It's surprising, original, well thought out, well acted out (exclusion of Howie Long I'm afraid) and utterly beautiful as only John Woo can. 10/10  "},{"Title":"A sinematic masterwork","Date":"21 June 2002","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  Broken arrow has been critisized by some as being corny, boring and stupid.

This film does not havecheesy special effects it is merely shot like an old fashioned opera - where the effects on stage are clearly not meant to be realistic in any way. What thisprovides is a chance to savor the acting talents of Travolta and Slater. Their development in this movie is a fine example of a pair of actors who havereached their peak. One could easily compare this masterpiece to one of thehighest rated movies of all time...The Battleship Potemkin. I've seen this movie several times, but each time I am still brought to tears at the end of the movie. Such a heroic ending to such a sadistic plot. Being in the military for most of my life, I can appreciate the inner struggles that Travolta and Slater no doubt had to go through to play their roles effectively in this masterpiece. The score adds to the tension and drama in this movie as well. If you want a good action flick, throw away Saving Private Ryan and all those other duds, pick up a DVD ofBroken Arrow and prepare to go on an emotional and physical rollercoaster ride that if your're not careful, could leave you in a fiery, catatonic state.

After reading Ebert's review of Broken Arrow I have come to realise that he is a brainless moron that just raves on for a long time. I still think that his reviews are a little deeper, but I think that he was a little too scathing on Broken Arrow. Anyway, if the film was that bad, why did he give it a 2 out of 4 and not a 0 like he did to North.Broken Arrow is a simple action film about a man that steals two nuclear bombs and uses them to blackmail the government. This movie basically contains four helicopters blowing up, a young park ranger who happens to be a woman, and lots of machine gun fights. This is not a bad thing, but compared to Woo's Hong Kong movies, Broken Arrow does not make the grade. The only interesting character is Deakins (John Travolta) who turns traitor after twenty years in the airforce and being over looked so many times for promotion. Hale (Christian Slater) is Deakins' co-pilot and is like a younger brother to Deakins. Deakins knows all about Hale and thus is able to predict every move of his. This make is a little interesting.The interesting thing about Deakins is that we begin by not know what he really is like. We think that Deakins and Hale will be the bad guys, but then we discover that he is the force behind the theft of the bombs and that our original impression was not correct. Beyond that the characters are fairly shallow and don't even seem to show the depth that the characters in Woo's Hong Kong movies and Face Off seem to have.

Over the course of the film there is almost constant action as the two officers struggle for possession of the weapons this means plenty of shootouts, car chases, fights and exploding helicopters!The plot may have a few holes in it and if one thinks about it for too long there are plenty of unlikely occurrences but that doesn't matter as the action seldom lets up and that action is always stylish as one would expect from former Honk Kong Action supreme John Woo.

Samantha Mathis puts in a feisty performance as the Park Ranger who finds herself dragged into helping Hale after she finds him in the desert following him being force to eject from the plane. The action is accompanied be a good sound track from Hans Zimmer; the music is never over the top but fits perfectly with the stylish action.

That said, even the blockiest of action blockbusters should have some sort of character depth from which the audience can begin to be involved with. Broken Arrow doesn't have that, Woo and Yost forgo such things and just launch into an hour and forty five minutes of adrenalin rushes, set around a good guy versus bad guy premise with Samantha Mathis dragged along side the good guy for the token female interest. The absence of any wit in the script is particularly galling, especially since Travolta's mugging cries out for some corny throw away lines. But for action seekers, at least, Broken Arrow is undeniably good trashy fun. Woo knows how to string action sequences together, and he also has this knack of making gun-play and carnage almost balletic. Cast wise it's best just to buy into Travolta enjoying himself, but Slater you sense is taking it all far too serious. Mathis is admirable given the scant flesh written onto her characters bones, while Gunton and Lindo are badly underused.

As for John Travolta, I liked the character a lot and every time, it it fun to watch. Honestly, without him, the movie might have been run of the mill. His smoking cigarette style and his mimics are unforgettable. The scene which he tries to break the bomb is one of my favorites. There is a very long action sequence in a cave that recalls The Rock. As we expected from a John Woo movie, a lot of bullets, acrobatic acts etc. almost all it has. I like the explosion scene, too, again especially for John Travolta. Despite, the movie and the characters seem shallow, I believe that one of his best performances of John Travolta is here. The relationship between Riley and Terry is very clich√© (generally, there is a supporter of the hero in action movies and it is often a female), but this is not so important. The last part of the movie is again a very long action sequence and some moments feed on other John Woo movies like MI-2, but I did not like the end, it was disappointing and a bit weird.

Woo was already an established director in his native China, with several blazing action movies to his credits. But, go through any of Woo's movies (Chinese or American) with a fine-tooth comb, and you'll be hard-pressed to find anything that doesn't show S-K-I-L-L.Fans and critics would argue that Woo's career has been wildly uneven in America, both camps being eager to make the claim that his American efforts are a mixed bag, and that 1997's Face/Off is probably the peak of his career here.1996's Broken Arrow is one of the director's most controversial American efforts, with star John Travolta playing bad guy Vic Deakins and Christian Slater as Riley Hale, the good guy. The unlikely pair star as two Air Force pilots flying a stealth bomber over the Utah desert, hauling two nuclear warheads, and things get ugly when Deakins gets the idea to steal the nukes and then sell them to some anonymous terrorist organization that plans to blackmail the government.Soon the government gets wind of the incident, as countless Washington bureaucratic stereotypes argue over how to keep the situation from the press. They eventually dub the incident a broken arrow, which is the term that's used to describe what happens when a nuclear weapon is lost. (***NOTE*** According to IMDb, the term broken arrow actually refers to when a warhead is accidentally detonated; the real term for when a weapon is lost is called an empty quiver. I guess the execs at Twentieth Century Fox thought that broken arrow had a lot more selling power to it.)What ensues of course, are plenty of stylized action scenes as the two dueling participants try to one-up the other and try to anticipate the opponent's next move. Along for the ride is Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis), who bears witness to the action and teams with Hale to try to stop the mad Deakins.From the get-go, the plot quickly begins to resemble Die Hard and Under Siege, in that the characters quickly dive into the archetypes developed in those two action movie classics. But under the expert and skillful tutelage of director Woo, the action is given that extra kick that elevates the material above any average qualities.The action scenes have those ultraviolent attributes that's become trademark of the director's films, complete with the duel-wielding gunplay, slow-motion actions shots, and the two men that are at constant war with one another, persistently trying to outdo the other man's actions.I certainly enjoyed Broken Arrow, despite its inconsistencies and (supposed) gaps in logic. A valiant effort, just like all of John Woo's action epics.7/10 "},{"Title":"More Proof that John Travolta Should Stick to Likeable Guys","Date":"25 March 2004","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller","Review":"  This is one stupid movie.

Stupid action movies make no such attempt.Example Mission Impossible is an action movie.  Mission Impossible 2 is a stupid action movie.  Thats not an insult, that's just what it is.Broken Arrow is one of my favorite stupid action movies.  The acting is bad (except for Travolta), the plot is recycled, and the dialog is c***.

Anyone who is interested in military aircraft knows the myst about the B3, the Area 51 bomber as it is sometime called.  This is the first movie, and the only movie, I've seen that has a replica B3 in it.  I almost wet myself thinking about that machine!Number 2  Travolta.

In this respect, Bob Gunton, as the evil financier, must be singled out as turning in one of the worst performances I've ever seen -- absolutely shameful.  The special effects, though generally OK, were surprisingly poor at some points, with some of the aerial sequences scarcely looking better than a good effort from a Nintendo 64.

I enjoyed it the first time, but only on second viewing did it strike me how average, misused and mediocre this film is.Christian Slater and John Travolta play US pilots who have to fly nuclear weapons cross country. Unfortunately, half way, Travolta tries to hijack the ship and shoot Slater, but fails. He releases the nukes over sandy dunes, then launches himself and Slater out of the ship.After crashing on ground, Slater teams up with a cutesy-tutesy ranger and the two go after Travolta to find out his plan.Travolta plans on stealing the nukes and making the government pay to get them back, or else he will nuke the south-west of the US. So Slater and what's-her-face end up fighting for the nukes on a speeding train.Broken Arrow borrows from just about every single action film out there, including Mission Impossible, Speed, Die Hard, and the list goes on and on. Mad Man steals nukes; makes people pay; Good Guy fights him. Seen it, right? Sadly, right. Everything is cliched, but the worst thing is that it has been done before, and ten times better. Speed was just about one of the most explosive films in recent years; Broken Arrow is just another rip-off.Director John Woo, who usually makes quite good kung-fu/slow-motion flicks (Face/Off is one of the best action films in recent years), fails here at what he usually does so easily. Some of his mistakes are classics.1. He presents us with an overused plot (as I said before), and shallow characters and dialogue. Now sometimes the dialogue is fun, like when an attack chopper is chasing Slater and the pilot says, Let's have some fun.Because if he didn't say that we'd be saying, C'mon, he's in a helicopter and he can't shoot the guy? But because he says he is playing with them, it makes it more fun to watch.There's also a part where the female lead runs at a computer nerd working on a nuclear bomb, and he grabs her and says, You thought I was a computer nerd, didn't you? Lady, I was a Navy Seal!Stuff like that is great, but the other things characters say are pretty shallow.2. With a plot (and characters) as shallow as this, he tries to make everything very dramatic and tense and symbolic. In an intelligent action film like Face/Off that works, but here the characters ARE shallow, and when we see them walking in slow motion making appearances (look at the scene where Travolta walks over a sand dune) just looks stupid. I nearly laughed when I saw Travolta filmed in slow-mo, and the whole thing with the twenty dollars is both overused and misused.3. Too many explosions for its own good actually makes the film boring after a while. Truly. We get so used to the explosions that pretty soon they just get tiring and boring. I was getting pretty tired watching this flick, and thought about flipping it off at one point.4. The ending (spoilers) involves John Travolta fighting in a train with Christian Slater over a remote control that makes nuclear bombs go off. Things like that have been done before, and while the ending is particularly messy and nice, I still have seen better endings (Face/Off, The Rock, Speed--to name more recent explosive movies).I don't hate this film, and it is okay, but I'd never strongly recommend it, mainly because it is worn, misused, and slightly entertaining, but not entertaining enough.Before I close this review, I want to address one more thing. The nuclear bomb remote. Now, hold on a sec.Does it seem odd to you that the fate of 500,000 people can be held within a single remote control? Is this what our tax-money goes towards? So computer nerds can make really large digital readouts that look like alarm clocks, with a blinking interface that looks like a cell phone? Does our money pay so some guy can hold a TV-remote and determine the fate of half a million souls?I sure hope not.

No-one does cool like Christain Slater and John Woo, though i haven't seen Windtalkers yet. The action is the main draw here, and it is some of the best produced by Hollywood in the nineties, moving from air to land to sea via various explodable vehicles with fluidity.

And this was even before I knew that Woo's HK works and later films were twice a extravagant.I've heard that Woo's fans didn't like this movie because it was too tame for him. (Limited double gun action and so forth) While I would have liked this movie even more if Woo went all out like in THE KILLER or HARD-BOILED, he showed that he doesn't need to depend on bullet ballet film making to create cool action scenes. Relying on a gimmick is what kills some film makers, and Woo is a man who doesn't need to rely on his creation. (WINDTALKERS is another film that doesn't need HK styled action to look good) I was glad that his other traits were able to go on film. The standoff scene with Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis where he has the gun and she has a knife was put to great effect. And even though it seems odd that a park ranger would know a thing or two about combat, it made sense for Mathis' character since she was that type of actiony person. (I'd be fighting and shooting it out if I were a park ranger.) The use of slow motion was cool too. All of the sequences of things blowing up were awesome, and didn't rely on CGI as movies of today do. (Even though some of them use it correctly.) Of course the performances of the actors were all great. What else can I say other than John Travolta's vilainous performance was slick, and that Slater made a great action hero? (I hope he's the star of another cool action film. It was nice seeing his brief role in WINDTALKERS, but he needs more.) Samantha Mathis was really cool. Wo says he's always wanted to make a strong female character, and he really came close with her. The movie also features one of the best Hollywood fight scenes with the showdown between Slater and Travolta. Even after the Asian Invasian seeing this fight scene is still a good watch.

Hard target was his first American movie, this is his second American movie, which I think is incredible classic action thriller from the 90's I have ever saw. It is going to be 20. years since this movie come out and i still love it today more than any other movie.I love John Travolta in this movie which I think he did one of his best acting performances of his life. He acted convincing as the main villain Deakins in this movie. Broken Arrow has a great score, great actors and different style of terrorists, who stole nuclear warheads, but didn't took over some plant or building or plane or train etc.. It is completely different action movie. Christian Slater was awesome as the main hero. I love this movie and it is never too long or boring unlike Face/Off. In my honest opinion the movie to me is compared to Die Hard and it is one of John Woo's best underrated action movies but that is just my opinion. Plot When a B-3 Stealth Bomber crashes in the Utah desert during a top-secret test run, the military quickly moves in to retrieve its two broken arrows. But the situation spins wildly out of control after one of the pilots reveals the crash to be part of an incredible nuclear extortion plot. Directed by acclaimed action director John Woo, in a story by Speed writer, Graham Yost. Starring John Travolta as Major Vic Deakins a USAF stealth pilot and Christian Slater co-stars as Capt. Riley Hale, his co-pilot.There ya go that is the basic plot about this movie, it is a die hard movie in a desert heat much a like as Stallone's Cliffhanger. But with very different story and it is a stand alone movie which I love that. John Woo never liked making sequels so A Better Tomorrow II (1987) was his last sequel he made, so I am glad this movie doesn't have any sequels, remakes or reboot. In my opinion the 80's had a lot of better action movies, but the 90's had a very cool action movies too. I still love Die Hard With A Vengeance to death and still love other action movies that were made in 90's. I love Broken Arrow to death! It is my favorite John Woo movie! This is a great film recently and it is a cool action movie. It's got action, excitement and interesting characters and Legendary music. I love this film. Christian Slater as the Good guy, the Hero was cool and John Travolta was an intriguing character and hilarious, damn what a rush. The action in here is amazing. Fun action, good acting, quick pace, and entertaining. The final sequence on the train has some quality explosions and even has bad guys killed by helicopter blades. The best thing about this movie though is John Travolta who hams it up beautifully; he is having an absolute blast as Vic Deakins, former US Air Force pilot turned terrorist loon. He also has one of the most over the top and awesome bad guy deaths of all time. I have always enjoyed this movie, I never felt bored I love the action sequences on the train when Hale (Christian Slater) uses one of his martial arts to defeat Deakins (John Travolta) was spectacular he deactivate the nuclear device and kills Deakins it was outstanding. Hans Zimmer theme for Deakins ripped off movie Scream 2 for Dewey (David Arquette) theme. Hans Zimmer provides one of his greatest scores to this movie with some nice twanging guitar from Duane Eddie. I love how any time Travolta is on screen he has this hilarious guitar theme tune which is cool, but hilarious funny at the same time. Broken Arrow has Woo's trademark slow motion and double gun-play galore. I believe there is the odd pigeon thrown in for good measure too. Not entirely sure Samantha Mathis was all that great as the female love interest, but it is cool to have a Pump up the Volume reunion (1990). Which I never watched that movie before I am glad they both of the actors (Christian Slater and Samantha Mathis) worked together once more again. Overall Broken Arrow has plenty of flaws but for sheer explosive entertainment you could do a lot worse. I love the movie and could watch it on repeat. The music is also totally epic. This movie get's is a perfect 10 by me. Last Year it was hardly for my supplier of Blu-ray's to get me this movie on Blu-ray I actually have this film in Blu-ray collection this one and Stallone's Cop Land was so hard to find.

For some reason, the magic just wasn't all there this time, maybe Woo's heart just wasn't in it. For one, the film lacks his typical visual flair for shoot-outs and gun battles, and there is a low death toll. Secondly, the plot has to be one of the most hackneyed things I've ever seen, with the old story of someone stealing nuclear weapons. The ending even rips off UNDER SIEGE 2, but at least things pick up a bit here, with an exciting fight sequence on a train.Sure, there are a few good moments; the bit where a man has a hammer thrown in his face, a bit where a nuclear weapon explodes underground, and the finale where Slater and Travolta slug it out on board a train about to crash, but these moments are few and far between. The miscasting in the film also doesn't help. Christian Slater is more suited to playing psychopaths rather than action heroes, and frankly he just isn't very believable in the role. John Travolta overdoes his psychotic madman role too much, and comes off irritating and childish rather than in the least bit menacing. Still, it's obvious he's enjoying himself in the role, and some of that enjoyment rubs off on the viewer. There are a couple of good actors in supporting roles (including cult favourite Kurtwood Smith), and Samantha Mathis is nice as the female lead, but the pairing of Slater and Travolta just doesn't work very well.Sure, I enjoyed this film a lot the first time I saw it, but on second viewing I realised just how empty it really is. Despite a few moments of impressive chases and fights, this is nothing we've not seen before and a big disappointment. The way that every helicopter explodes in the film is pretty ridiculous too.

Hans Zimmer composed the music of this movie and it's pretty much one of the best soundtracks of all time.To sum it up, Broken Arrow is terrible, it's so cheesy and stupid you have to leave your brain at home to enjoy it. But if you're insane like me and actually enjoy stupid, funny, cheesy 80's and 90's movies, this one is for you. "}{"Title":"it was..

Christian Slater and John Travolta both started as rival military pilots, one as the good guy and one as the bad guy with evil intentions. Originally working together, their intentions differ and their differences collide after Travolta turns to the bad side and helps other ex-military officers steal two nuclear weapons from Travolta and Slater's abandoned military jet. Travolta and his crew end up racing against Slater, who has teamed himself with a female park ranger who even attempted to arrest him after he was forced to parachute out of his jet during a sky-high confrontation with Travolta. Both teams have their eyes on the nuclear warheads, with their explosive atom-splitting power that we have seen the effects of before (200,000 dead in the U.S. nuclear attack on Japan)... only, both the teams have quite different intentions. Slater, of course, plans to disarm and return the weapons to the U.S. government. Travolta plans to detonate them...This was a pretty basic comic book bubblegum-style action movie. There was lots of good special effects and vehicle/helicopter chases, machine gun battles, and explosions. It had a pretty basic plot (kind of similar to a mediocre combination of Face/Off and The Rock) and good acting... It was entertaining... still, I wish it could have been better and think it deserved maybe 6.5 out of 10 stars. Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments...

When those fell through (one movie was supposed to be an action film set in the jungles of Central America and another was a remake of The Killer) he worked on a film that would eventually become Broken Arrow. John Woo's transformation from Hong Kong director to Hollywood film maker is complete. Armed with a large budget and a named cast, Broken Arrow was ready to roll.Christian Slater and John Travolta star opposite each other in this run-of-the-mill action picture. The story deals with double crosses and betrayals. The fate of the free world is in the hands of Mr. Slater as Johnnie Boy snaps one day and loses a cache of nuclear war heads. Christan has to play hero as he single handedly tries to apprehend Johhnie Boy and his gang of goons. Can he do it? How much will John Woo pilfer from his own work this time? Is it a watchable movie? To find out the answers to the questions you'll have to watch Broken Arrow!An okay film. John Woo would show flashes of his former self in Face-Off but it would be all for naught when his next project rolls off of the assembly line. Too bad, know we all know who's the better film maker between John Woo and Ringo Lam after watching their total cinema portfolio.Recommended for fans of John Woo's Hollywood work.

In a sort of trial run for the outstanding FACE/OFF 2 years later, Woo made this unbelievably dumb but greatly enjoyable action-thriller, with then comeback king John Travolta and Jack Nicholson-lookalike Christian Slater. The plot is about how a demented US airforce captain (Travolta) steals the nuclear weapons he's carrying on his stealth bomber jet with young 'un Slater. However, after crash landing, Slater teams up with a bewildered park ranger, Samantha Mathis, to track down the bombs.   The script has it's moments, none of them to do with great characterisation or inspiring dialogue (although Travolta's 'Ain't that cool' inspired an entire website), but the action scenes, however mundane they are, are handled well by maestro Woo.  Travolta hams it up to the point that he looks like Vincent Price with a machine gun, and the whole silliness of the film does have a certain overpowering effect on the viewer. It's a shame that Slater, a brilliant actor of his generation, cannot quite pull off the hunky action hero role, whilst Mathis just looks totally lost throughout the movie. This is not a missed opportunity, because there was never any real potential to make a fantastic movie, but it does exactly what it says on the tin brainless, action-packed, and utterly watchable. A good little movie to kick-off Friday night's viewing.

Not unexpected, the rest of the movie is about Haley and a park ranger (Samantha Mathis) trying to foil Deakins' mad-man plot.Broken Arrow is helmed by one of action cinema's most acclaimed directors, John Woo, and with a lavish budget and big stars on hand, you'd think he'd have created an action masterpiece.  But unfortunately, Broken Arrow is anything but, it's a routine thriller with a few good setpieces, but is awkwardly plotted, poorly acted, and directed without much of a sense of momentum or ebb and flow.The movie's not entirely without merit, there is a nice chase sequence in the desert that's actually quite exhilarating and a few signature Woo touches lend a nice sense of familiarity.  But this is overshadowed by everything else that's wrong, namely the cast.  I'm not sure who's idea it was to cast Broken Arrow, but Christian Slater is simply not action hero material.  He's also not much of an actor.  Samantha Mathis is also bland and totally unengaging as the would-be perky park ranger.  Then there's John Travolta, who clearly relishes the role of psycho villain.  It's a hammy performance for an actor who's made a career of going over-the-top, but for some reason, even he isn't much fun to watch.Broken Arrow's biggest problem is its lack of consistent momentum.  The action sequences don't really seem to build up, they're just sort of inserted here and there at any given opportunity.  Even the climactic sequence, set on board a train, doesn't deliver any genuine thrills.  And maybe it's just me, but the idea of Travolta suddenly and willingly deciding on a fistfight to finish things up struck me as pretty stupid, and yet again another example of this movie's tendency to interfere with its own building momentum.John Woo's previous films have been fairly pretentious (lots of slow-motion, lots of doves), but Broken Arrow desires to be nothing more than pure escapist entertainment.  While I absolutely realize this film should be taken as nothing more than a shallow experience, it still doesn't work as such, marred by completely uninteresting characters, silly dialogue, and mostly unexciting action.

The problem with Broken Arrow is it seems too much like an Hollywood picture and not a John Woo picture.  Also, some of the things that made him a great action director is missing as the product seems watered down.  I thought that John Travolta should have played his character in a quiet and evil way in a similar manner as Henry Fonda's Frank in Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West.The music seems to try to reach the level of Ennio Moricone, but ends up failing in the process.  It seems that the female lead was more heroic than Christian Slater's character was as if his main purpose was to move the plot along.  This makes his previous motion picture Hard Target(1993) look like a masterpiece in comparison.  The most positive thing about this movie is it did well at the box office which proved to Hollywood execs that John Woo is the real deal(at least with giving him a little more freedom on his next feature film Face/Off(1997).

This movie is absolutely atrocious in every aspect directing, acting, special effects, dialog, plot-line, you name it.

There are so many errors and mistakes in the plot that you'll be hard pushed to find a more illogical and nonsensical movie. Travolta's campy performance doesn't help matters either. He seems to be under the impression that every nuance he's worked into the character is cool and slick, but Vic Deakins really is one of the most annoying bad guys of the 90s, purely on his own arrogance. Travolta is, without a doubt, miscast in the role. Deakins has clearly lost his mind, though we never feel the slightest bit of empathy for him, which is trademark of John Woo villains. But his direction is almost entirely muted too (it's practically a generic action film), with little of his usual flair. It's supposed to be fast paced, going from one climax/hair's breadth escape to the next, but it's padded out with dozens of 'helicopters just flying around' scenes.Christian Slater is simply okay as the stupidly-named Riley Hail, the hero of the flick, and the gorgeous Samantha Mathis doesn't have much to do other than stand around looking distressed and pretty. When her beautiful face isn't on screen the film truly lags, which is a tragedy for an action film.And how many helicopters did they blow up in this film? It seems as if a helicopter blows up every five minutes. It becomes so dull and repetitive. Boom! An explosion! Wow! What so interesting about the zillionth ball of flame rising into the air? The only thing that saves the movie from a lower rating is Hans Zimmer's highly exciting and atmospheric score. Without it Broken Arrow would be no ore than a Broken Movie.If you want a countryside based/railroad/ nuclear actioner then check out Under Siege 2 Dark Territory.

It was the first movie I ever saw in an aeroplane, on a flight to Detroit to visit relatives for Christmas. The problem is, it was immediately followed by the Jerry Bruckheimer action flick The Rock and if you've seen both of these movies then you'll know which is the better. In which case, you may as well toddle off right now. If you haven't seen either of them then pay attention because Broken Arrow is a shocking effort from arguably Hong Kong's finest director John Woo. Lacking much of the Woo style and polish that propelled him into Hollywood, this is little more than a brainless, trigger-happy waste of a film that quickly runs out of steam and descends into farce.John Travolta and Christian Slater play a couple of US Air Force pilots on a routine training exercise over Utah. Whilst testing a stealth plane's abilities, Major Deakins (Travolta) takes the opportunity to steal two nuclear warheads that happen to be on board the plane (despite the fact it's a mere training exercise) by ejecting Captain Hale (Slater) out of the plane and crashing it near others in on the plan. It is soon left to Hale and an impossibly cute Park Ranger by the name of Terry Carmichael (Samantha Mathis)to recover the warheads and make them safe, while Travolta's evil plan begins to take shape. Not exactly rocket science but there you go.It's safe to say that this is one of the simplest action films I've ever seen, with a relatively small cast and a plot so basic that only the most moronic of viewers will struggle to keep up. Despite this, there are some truly awe-inspiring lapses of logic such as the hilarious scene where Travolta, seemingly having planned everything down to the last detail, can't find someone hidden beneath a blanket in a small boat. It almost takes your breath away how clich√©d the whole thing is and without the usual stylistic tricks of action-master Woo (seen in stuff like MI 2), it feels like a cheap and nasty TV movie. Slater is probably the best of the performances alongside Delroy Lindo as an Air Force support guy but Travolta is in standard pantomime-bad-guy mode. For further examples, see rubbish like The Punisher or Swordfish but only if you wanted a laugh.It's such a shame that Woo's American career got off to such a dodgy start (this is the second US film he made, after the Van Damme film Hard Target). The plot and genre are hardly taxing and yet this is a real dog's dinner. Compared to something like The Rock which is not the best example of an action movie (and one I was forced to compare this to by the airline), this is an absolute waste of time, money and effort. Indeed, I'm struggling to see what attracted Woo to the project in the first place unless he was straining at the leash to work with a resurgent Travolta. Assuming you switch your brain to just above comatose levels of activity, you might enjoy the whole silliness of it all but honestly, I can't recommend anything about this picture to anyone. My advice is to stick with Woo's later material such as Face/Off or his earlier Hong Kong career such as the gritty cop film Lashou Shentan (Hard Boiled). Or you can watch another action film altogether because the chances are, it'll be better than this.

Slater is a lovable hero and is very charismatic on the screen, as he should be, and Travolta is a washed-up two-bit actor who talks through his teeth and in this movie makes a horrible opponent for Slater. When two nuclear warheads are stolen by a group of terrorists, Slater teams up with the deformed yet somehow alluring Samantha Mathis (who was also with Slater in the much better film, Pump Up The Volume) to steal back the warheads. What follows is over an hour of poor computer graphics and some very unsuspenseful and uninspiring fight scenes in the wasteland of Utah. Will everything turn out alright? Will Howie Long get sacked? Will Slater and Mathis become a couple under pressure (like Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock in Speed)? Check it out to see. This film is not recommended. (Worst one I've been forced to watch by my friends in over a month.)

Really it should have been named Broken Helicopter -- by my rough count they wreck at least 3, maybe 4, helicopters during the course of this film.Travolta is over-the-top, of course, and Slater is fine in his role.  Howie Long does a good job as the henchman.I wouldn't spend money to see this, but if it's on cable and you're in the mood for a lot of wrecked helicopters, check it out.

It's not usual to watch two attackers point weapons at each others' faces, but BROKEN ARROW sure could use a face-lift! The acting needs better work! Neither of the two leading men can act as tough as they should, with John Travolta in the worst-case scenario. Samantha Mathis, while attempting to be the leading action lady in a few parts, suffers from a nervous breakdown. What's interesting is the suspense of preventing a nuclear catastrophe, but that premise is overridden by too many borrowed cliches from other action-adventure movies. Listen for Travolta shouting Hush! Hush! in a softer, keener voice when he's the one plotting the destruction. Woo fans can woo over FACE/OFF or any of his original material. Some things are meant to be broken, and this movie doesn't put itself back together.

This turkey never left the ground it was so weighted with a dull script and terminally stupid dialogue.

The way that the hero (played by Christian Slater) narrowly escapes death from everything that comes his way is laughable to the point that by halfway through the movie I was hoping he would be killed so that the film would end. Nothing in the movie comes even close to being plausible - every plot detail is riddled with holes and demonstrates the producers had a complete lack of understanding of how things work in the real world. By the end of the movie I was left wondering why I had bothered to waste my time and money to see it through to the end, had I seen the movie thinking it was intended as a comical parody of the action movie genre I might have enjoyed it a lot more.This is the worst film I have ever seen, ever!
