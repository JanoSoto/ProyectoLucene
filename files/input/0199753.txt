Artificial gravity to stimulate adaptation to Martian conditions . AMEE a multi-purpose robot with aerial probe . Cushioned landing . Wearable spacesuits . Other points of realism were the accurate 'fire in space' sequence, and the computer technology used by the crew. Red Planet could have been better, but it's decent compared to most  Holywood products.

The special effects are very realistic, down to the pink-tinted Martian sky. The plot is plausible (for science fiction), paying attention to many small details that often make these kinds of movies farcical. Most important, it's very existential; humans simply trying to survive against almost insurmountable odds. As the struggle builds, the relationships begin to gel nicely. This IS a movie about human relationships, not Star Wars style hype. I know, there are some weak spots. The opening and closing dialog, Val Kilmer whispering all the way through, some of the dialog, etc. But overall, this movie doesn't try to do too much (unlike the abysmal Mission To Mars), and that's what makes it a success.

He doesn't seem interested in the story and his acting is lazy. He looks like a lost surfer dude on Mars. They should have hired another actor instead of Kilmer. Some characters were weak (Stamp and Bratt). The designs of the ship's interior were a tad cheesy. The dialogue was sometimes terrible. And the story had some major holes in it, like the idea that the ship's censors didn't detect the breathable atmosphere on Mars.But aside from those problems, the rest is fun. It's a straight forward science fiction story. If you don't like that kind of story, you'll certainly won't like this. It reminded me of ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS or PITCH BLACK, in the way it respected the sci-fi themes and elements without watering them down for the audience. Tom Sizemore and Carrie-Anne Moss are excellent in their roles. Some of the cinematography is excellent.

Maybe the characters are not fully developed but name a science fiction movie where the characters are completely developed.  The movie is called Red Planet not Who are the People Who are Going to Mars to Save Earth? and we join the action in media res which means in the middle of things so character development is not stressed in the beginning.  Good grief.  People throw around scientific, cinematic, and character development flaws with the movie instead of trying to enjoy the suspense of this movie.You are stuck on the planet Mars.  No food or water.  Someone on the crew is already dead and another is a little sketchy.  You have a limited time to get off the planet, your friendly neighborhood military robot has decided to play Seek and Destroy, and something mysterious is happening on the surface of Mars involving tiny, bio-luminescent aphids.So imagine all of that and you will get an idea of what the writers and director wanted to recreate for the audience.  I liked this movie.  I recognize there are flaws in the movie and possibly the acting but honestly I thought it was a great premise.  Reminded me of the Greek myth of Jason and Argonauts on their quest for the Golden Fleece.I would give the movie 4 stars out of a possible 5.  Before you write and tell me how inaccurate or misguided a movie-goer I am realize I have read the classic sci-fi adventures from the likes of Heinlein, Clarke, and Bradbury.

They encounter the mandatory storyline problems - a sunflare triggers a burst of radiation which mainly disables the mothership so the crew has to escape prematurely, but the captain (Carrie-Ann Moss of Matrix fame) stays behind to try and salvage the ship, otherwise they are all doomed to be stranded on Mars.The 4 men make a very rough landing, and even with the balloons deployed, the older one gets a ruptured spleen and stays behind to die. The others make it to the home base that had been built previously, only to find it destroyed and all supplies gone. About to die of oxygen starvation, Kilmer opens his mask to find they can breath.

He gets into orbit, Carrie-Ann retrieves him, they finally kiss!Kinda cheesy in many places, most of the science is very shaky, some of the funny lines are clever, others are stupid, but as a Sci-Fi film not to be taken too seriously, it is fun entertainment, especially on DVD with a good sound system.

Last year we had Pitch Black which i thought was okay.........and we had Red Planet.Red Planet came with a reasonably large budget, a really superior cast to Mission to Mars and absolutely great special effects.  The main story line in itself is not ground breaking, but the sub plots within the film give the film its real grip!A crew of 4 astranauts and 2 science officers agree to board a mission into building a new home on mars through the aid of making it a breathable atmosphere through the aid of planting algae.Then in comes your usual suprises, the spacecraft that their in hits critical conditions causing them to land on Mars earlier than they wanted to and therefore building a storyline of what they are going to do to get back to earth.The sub plot involving the crews relationship between pentigill who was a last minute choice for the mission is excellent.  Simon Baker plays the character excellently and you never know wether to trust him or hate him.

Two films coming out in the same year, set on the same planet, with the same production values and featuring casts of equal talent. While both movies also feature numerous scientific inaccuracies and stupidities, each has something different to offer. If you are looking for mystique, try Mission to Mars, but if you want action or thrills, then go with Red Planet.Set in the mid twenty first century, Earth is dying, and humanity has turned to Mars as a potential replacement. An unmanned terraforming experiment has been attempted (according to the introductory narration) Months later, it appears to have failed, so a group of astronauts are sent out to investigate. They are surprised and excited to discover not only breathable air but the existence of life on the barren cold red world. When their space craft shuts down however, not only are they stranded, but they become threatened by the malfunctioning of their navigator droid 'Amee'. These few individuals must survive to carry the news back to Earth which proves that man can live on the Red Planet.I think the story works decently as a nifty sci-fi thriller. Mars in this film looks quite convincing, because the terrain closely resembles the photographs taken by the Pathfinder in 1997. The color scheme is made up of browns and tans, rather than the over saturated red from Mission to Mars. Ret Planet was received better than Brian De Palma's movie, and I can see why. Although neither of them are examples of great filmaking, I would recommend them both.

Most sci-fi films today put the special effects first before characterizations. While that's not a bad idea (I have enjoyed several films in that vein such as Independence Day), films can become too dependent on that and that's when the fun drains away.Red Planet is a film that has solid special effects, but also a strong story and good characterizations. It was the second film released in 2000 to have Mars as its backdrop, the first being Mission to Mars. Mission to Mars, despite having top stars,master craftsman Brian DePalma directing and phenomenal special effects, was a little too pat and resorted to cliches (Not that I blame DePalma; he did the best he could with the script he had and the film wasn't bad at all)I didn't know anything about the plot and I think that helps with a film like Red Planet. It allows suspense to be created from the series of crises that spring up on the astronauts and that's a benefit. But I will say this the marketing campaign for Red Planet advertises this as your typical good guys versus evil aliens action fest. It is not. This is a more intelligent and stylish film than given credit for. It owes more to 2001 and The Black Hole or even the classic Republic serial Radar Men from the Moon than Alien. It is about ideas, not effects and I LOVE films like that.I know a great many people will hate this film. That is because popular culture has brainwashed people into thinking mass entertainment revolves around effects only. There are some flaws (mostly in technological probability and pacing in the first 20 minutes)but writer Chuck Pfarrer and director Antony Hoffman remember that great sci-fi is also about the story and characters and the result is the best sci-fi film in recent years.***1/2 out of 4 stars  "},{"Title":"Better Val than Nothing","Date":"4 January 2001","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  There are worse ways to spend 100 minutes.

Outstanding special effects, a competent cast, great sound, and an artistic eye for set design are the film's strong points. After what seems like a long drought, it's nice to see the sleek Carrie-Anne Moss back on the screen. Serious, pragmatic, and physically fit, she is a natural choice for a mission commander. Some might argue that she and the other characters are somewhat wooden, but I would counter that coolness is a requisite trait in those individuals who are selected to fly such a mission. The director had to choose between verisimilitude and dramatic impact, and I applaud his riskier choice of the former.Special effects and set design really stand out and are worth the price of admission. Just when you are thinking that they are going to use the typical cop-out of artificial gravity on a spaceship, the centrifuges fail, and we are treated to some of the best weightlessness scenes ever filmed. Other reviewers have complained that fire scenes in the ship look fake, but how are we supposed to know what fires look like in free-fall in the first place? I think the f/x people did a great job in speculating on how a fire would behave in such conditions. Scenes on Mars were breathtaking, I think better even than those of this year's earlier release, MISSION TO MARS. Also, this is the first film I can recall that tried to do anything with the fact that Mars gravity is about one-third that of Earth's. I realize that low-g is difficult to simulate on film, but I do applaud the filmmakers for the small (and humorous) attempt they made to accommodate it.While I do recommend seeing this feature in theatrical release for the majesty of the picture and sound, this is not to say there aren't a lot of problems, some quite massive. Generally these relate to plausibility1. The ship design is totally outlandish. The thing is _huge_, with oodles of wasted space. There are two enormous counter-rotating centrifuges to simulate gravity for the crew; this makes the ship more on the scale of the space station envisioned in 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY. This is for a crew of six! And with all that wasted mass, the Mars landing module is not much bigger than an Apollo lunar module. Was there any kind of space travel expert to advise the filmmakers on how ridiculous this is?2. The Martian terraforming theory is completely at odds with what is known about the planet from probes that have been going there since 1976. The movie explains that nuclear weapons are sent to the polar caps to melt (actually sublime) the CO2 ice, which then acts as a greenhouse gas to heat up the atmosphere. When it's warm enough, algae are introduced to generate oxygen. The problem is that THERE IS NO WATER ON THE SURFACE OF MARS, GUYS. Algae can't grow without water. Then, there are other ecological aspects that are even more ridiculous, but to go into those gives away too much of the plot. Just be prepared to have your suspended sense of disbelief pulled out from under you.3. Stupid little script errors that a little research could have avoided. First, don't try to do CPR the way Carrie-Anne Moss did it in the film; it's completely wrong. The geneticist remarks that his work is all about genetic code, you know, A, G, T, and P. The problem is that THERE IS NO 'P'. It's 'C' for cytosine. Again, sloppy writing.Now, I realize that there are perennially dyspeptic science nerds out there who can never enjoy a science fiction movie because of this or that little inaccuracy. Trust me; I'm not one of those, and I can suspend disbelief as well as the next person. But RED PLANET just pushes it way too far, to the extent that there is compromise of the movie-watching experience. If you know little about science and nothing about Mars, you may rate the film fairly high, but otherwise, be prepared for a jolt.

However, the life that is found on Mars isn't really the emphasis of the film.  This film is more of a survival story, like Apollo 13, in which everything is going wrong and the crew must use every resourceful bone in their bodies to stay alive.  Most of the story is believable.  Though where the life on Mars came from (the bugs, not the algae) is kind of a mystery. (I thought the theory of spontaneous generation had been disproved!)The story has some occasional flashbacks in the narrative that, I thought, worked well.  The budding romance between Bowman and Gallagher is believable.  These two characters are very likeable, and so is Sizemore's. Moss is going to continue to grow as an actress in the film industry, mostly because directors in Hollywood are going to want her in their films.  She conveys an inner strength, like Weaver did in Alien and Aliens.  She's very sexy, yet she can easily be believable as a Ph.D like in Red Planet.  And she doesn't bring so much of a personality or ego to the screen like most stars do.  (though perhaps that's because she's just begun as an actress)There is some exciting scenes in this film, with excellent special effects that never dominate the film.  The directing is good--some scenes were quite effective emotionally.  The dialogue is good, ten times better than the dialogue in Mission To Mars, which was terrible at times.  Red Planet has some good humor too.  And Red Planet's climax/ending was far better than the hokey climax of Mission to Mars (which was conveniently narrated to the intellectually challenged).I give Red Planet three stars (or an 8 rating on here).  Science-fiction devotees certainly should not miss this one.  Nor should those who are interested in space and space exploration in a more scientific, less fictional, way.  Some of the vistas on Mars are very impressive.  However, one thing that might bother the truly scientific was the artificial gravity on the ship.  Mission to Mars used a centrifuge, which is much more believable (even though it was too small and moved to slow to be truly effective).  However, that is certainly not a major drawback to Red Planet.

The tough-as-nails, damn-my-orders-I'll-save-my-crew captain is a woman-Carrie-Anne Moss from The Matrix.   The gray-haired old scientist-an underused Terence Stamp-has turned to philosophy and religion, where in the old days he would have been a hard-headed skeptic (that role is left to biologist Tom Sizemore). 	The premise is that, by the year 2057, Earth is so badly polluted that we are seeding the sands of Mars with algae to produce oxygen so that humans can colonize the red planet (don't algae need water to live?)-but the algae have suddenly vanished from our telescopes.  So Commander Bowman and her crew are sent to investigate.  While she orbits in a crippled spaceship, the five men (including pilot Benjamin Bratt and Simon Baker-the obligatory Guy From Brooklyn) land on Mars in a suspenseful crash scene. 	I won't give away what they find, but I will say the solution to the mystery is more like something out of a good science fiction novel than a Hollywood sci-fi movie.  There is life on Mars, but it's not a typical movie monster.  But there is the expedition's robot, AMEE, which is damaged in the crash landing, reverts to its original military programming, and starts stalking the men like a rogue lion.  This leads to scenes reminiscent of another Val Kilmer film, the underrated The Ghost and the Darkness. 	The premise may be far-fetched, but I thought the execution and resolution of Red Planet were exciting and  satisfying.  (And yes, guys, Carrie-Anne does get one brief, gratuitous shower scene.)

Unlike STRANDED (2001), the RED PLANET takes an average, somewhat predictable script that attempts to retain technical integrity with a stereotypical plot outline of survival on Mars along with some fairly manipulative plot devices and comes up with a decent and engaging movie. The weaknesses, however, intrude at moments as the death toll rises and the action, special effects and disasters mount, though some of the scenes, particularly in the beginning are shot for all they are worth even though its just sometimes unbelievable. The actors make do with their dialogue which even though there isn't as much life to some of it, is technically consistent most of the time and practical at other times. The movie is uneven, attempting to be everything to everybody - a serious technically correct movie like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). RED PLANET even takes the computer plot and expands it in a way that is more a horror monster subgenre rather than a sci fi conumdrum that 2001 was able to maintain. A much better job of a straight forward and realistic and serious sci fi drama is captured in STRANDED. At the same time, RED PLANET strives for psychological and physical action thrills that are found in the more polished and richly produced MISSION TO MARS (2000), released the same year as RED PLANET and contains a more sci fi theme with a stronger alien plot like CONTACT (1997). Overall, the RED PLANET is true to itself and follows in the mold of other decent survival movies with not much more, but with an above average commitment to serious sci fi science and speculation distinguishing it from the rest of the pack.

The story was pretty different from most sci-fi movies and that's what makes it such a treat to watch.Basically, the movie takes place decades in future and follows a group of scientists that is sent to Mars with a special mission find out why a terraforming process has stopped. It is the first human mission to Mars and is a desperate one because the Earth is slowly succumbing to overpopulation and pollution.Although a few of the characters are a bit on the extreme side, the story and special effects are great. The plot moves fast and things are always happening. Because the story is somewhat unconventional, it is hard to know what is going to happen next. The special effects are very well done and nicely complement the story.Interestingly, the tone of the story is pretty different than most Mars movies. Instead of an alien planet/aliens approach, this movie has a strong scientific and rational tone about it.This a great movie to watch. Because it has a stronger science feel than most sci-fi movies, it will be most appreciated by an adult audience.

I watched this film on C4 last night after reading a review that called it 'shocking'. It's not shocking, it's actually surprisingly original.The director gives us a great sense of the hopelessness of the astronauts' plight with his long shots of martian landscapes, and the plot centres on taking all the worst and best bits of mankind (as is stated at the end) and transplanting them to the vast 'arena' that is mars to see which will triumph. It's not supposed to be exciting, Alien-type action from beginning to end, it's more a study of good vs evil, creationism vs darwinism (stamp vs sizemore), questioning faith and belief, all set as far away from the normal context of these as is possible.The characters could have been developed a lot further, and Mr Stamp could have been a lot less wooden, but I think the film was a brave attempt at making a sci-fi movie with a difference, dealing with the problems with humanity and not just a lot of big, slavering beasties! The sfx were good, the kind of low-key ones that enhance a film, rather than take it over (Mr Lucas take note...). AMEE was one of the best-looking cgi robots i have ever seen, appearing mechanically accurate for the most part. The space parts were a wee-bit Babylon 5 (ie made in a bedroom somewhere), and i liked the technology (space suits, glass circuits, bouncy landing pod thingy), all looked like the kind of thing that are derivative of what we have now, we COULD have these things in 50 years time.Overall, the film ain't perfect, but it's a damn site better than 'shocking'.

A desperate human race that has ruined its own environment tries to seed the surface of Mars with algae to create an oxygen atmosphere.  Our heroes travel to Mars to see how the experiment is working and of course, they get hit with every calamity possible once they arrive.  The experiment succeeded but spawned unanticipated consequences and naturally, on top of all their other troubles, the robot guardian designed to protect the crew decides it would be more fun to hunt them down and kill them.The problem with the film is the presentation.  First time feature director Antony Hoffman's pacing is ponderous, making the film seem much longer than it is.  I was surprised to see that it only ran an hour and 46 minutes.

The visual effects are good, but not up to the standard set by `Mission to Mars', though the story here is better and more believable than M2M.The acting is good, particularly Carrie-Anne Moss.  Moss gives her character resourcefulness and toughness without losing the vulnerable side.  Val Kilmer seems unsure how to play his character.  He alternates between bold action hero, and philosophical weenie.  His performance is decent, but I have seen him much better (`Ghost and the Darkness', `The Doors').  I put much of the responsibility for this on the director, since Kilmer has proven he has the talent to handle a strong dramatic lead.  Tom Sizemore is excellent as the geneticist who is desperately trying to figure out the mechanism for what is happening on Mars before their time runs out.I enjoyed this film in parts and yawned through others.  I rated it a 6/10.  In the hands of a stronger director, it could have been a powerful film.

Surely earth would be monitoring its status by radio.After finding a 1200 baud modem, suddenly CD-quality voice communications became miraculously possible.Mars inexplicably had breathable air -- never before detected with even the most sophisticated instruments.The ultra-trained astronauts mistake the locust-like life of Mars for nematodes (tiny blind worms).The life support system gives only seconds of warning to change tanks before asphyxiation.It is as though none of the equipment or communications gear was ever tested in any way. Nothing works.The renegade robot is appropriately weird and terrifying, though no one ever explains why a Mars explorer robot would be trained in guerrilla warfare and had no off switch. It breaks off attacks to allow other troubles a crack at the heroes, with no explanation why.The flesh-eating locusts are creepy and quite believable.

For example; when Kilmer's character demonstrates the potential killing prowess of the robot Aimee, you just know that we are being set-up for a future conflict. Something that dangerous would almost certainly entail a remote master de-activator in everyone's kit. And as someone else has pointed out; if the atmosphere was dense enough to breath, it would have been detected by sensors. Indeed; it would have been clearly visible from the ship. The complete destruction of the base station is never adequately explained. How could a moss-munching beetle have the ability to rip open metal? But still, there's no hokum, unlike that pretentiously over-blown 'Mission To Mars'. The characters represent an interesting mix, not dissimilar to those of the 'Nostromo'. Some of the set-pieces are extremely nice. I particularly liked the acrylic roll-up screens, which are said to be the next big thing in home entertainment.I've seen this movie two or three times since it was released and have never felt cheated. I didn't expect too much, but got a little more than that. Sure; it's propped-up by its props, but what sci-fi movie isn't?Don't be put-off by the purists.

By contrast, while science fiction books and short stories retain action, a great many have had slightly awkward characterization and somewhat contrived plots, but also are based on far more science and technology. Red Planet reverses this tradition entirely. The strong point in this film is in the visual effects, which are spectacular, and the science and technology are head and shoulders above most science fiction movies, but everything else suffers. Val Kilmer and Carrie-Anne Moss both show great evidence of talent, but their performances are choppy, and the other performances are not so good at all. The cause of the problem is obvious. Neither the director nor the screenwriters have much experience, and it shows. The plot is not pulled together well, and the inexperienced director is either unable to extract the best performances, or unable to edit them properly. The effect is of 2001 a Space Odyssey, re-edited from the outtakes, visually and scientifically strong, but not a harmonious work of art.This movie could be an under-appreciated gem however, for the right person. The plot and scientific elements are not so accurate so as to be probable science, but they are as good as it gets for hard science fiction on screen. If you can put up with indifferent acting and somewhat contrived plotting, the comparative soundness of the science and the great visuals will make this a winner.

I'm not usually so baffled by reviews, but here's one where I don't get it. It has several weak points, which is why I took off a couple of points from my rating.

For those of you out there who like a decent sci-fi flick, which to me should involve a somewhat believable story based on a projection into the future of some aspect of current scientific thinking, plus suspense, this is a good one. It's not perfect, but the faults don't detract much from the enjoyment. Another point I enjoyed was the attention paid to details. The equipment used makes sense, the comments made are believable and coherent, the physics is properly accounted for in most cases (within limits of some artistic license of course), Certainly it's FAR better movie than, say, Mission to Mars. Also MUCH better than the obscenely ridiculous Armageddon for example, which got its share of criticisms, but not like Red Planet's organized barrage of negativism. Sad.So there are my three cents. It's a good movie, especially for fans of true sci-fi. It DOES suffer at a few points from a little too much Hollywoodism, but its qualities outweight its faults in this case.Rent it and expect the worst - and you'll be VERY pleasantly surprised.

In other words, what should have been a brief attention grabber was turned into an entire plot.  There was absolutely no attempt to segue into something the viewer might actually find intriguing.Character development is non-existent save for awful chatter about the meaning of life at the beginning of the film.

They voyage to Mars with a small crew to investigate what has apparently gone wrong with earth's attempt to terraform the Martian atmosphere by cultivating algae.

I remember when these two films came out and wondering what brilliant studio execs made the decision to release two commercial sci-fi thrillers based on our first manned Mars mission within a few weeks of each other. Hoffman's film is more original, more entertaining, better scripted, and the characters are more interesting. Both films are about equally plausible, though DePalma's is more obviously a fantasy.It does not take a rocket scientist to detect all the little problems with this film, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to make a decently entertaining film either, and red Planet does succeed in the latter.

Years later the process seems to have reversed and a ship is launched to find out why.  The arrival in orbit is greeted by a solar flare that damages the main ship and strands all but the pilot on the surface of Mars.  The robotic probe is damaged and switches to military mode - hunting the crew.  They discover that the air is breathable but still need to get off the planet alive.One of two Mars films made at roughly the same time, this film is the lesser of the pair (although neither was all that).  The plot varies wildly between science and action, but does neither that well.  The action side is mostly covered by crises in space and the robot Amee going nuts.  The space stuff is pretty good and the effects work reasonably well, but Amee is not that good; that subplot seems unnecessary and the effects on the robot look a touch silly.  Attempts to make the film dramatic and tense don't really work and it never really has a strong core to work from.The scientific stuff is of potential interest - especially in the week when Bush announced plans to build a space station on the moon to then send men to Mars.  However the whole idea of the doomed planet etc is never really explained (probably because it can barely stand up on it's own) and things happen on the planet just to move things forward.  Considering the film is book ended by a global problem I was surprised that this side of it wasn't more of a big deal.  It should have been more gripping and more thought provoking as an idea - life on Mars? But it wasn't.The cast try hard but none of their characters are really ever expanded above the level of `fodder'; hell, for the majority of them I couldn't even tell you their role on the mission!  Moss is OK in the lead and does well in her solo role in space.  Kilmer is not that good at all, but in fairness I never really liked him as a leading man so am biased.  He is too light for a part that could have done with a spark to lighten it up.  Sizemore has a meatier role and is good in it but Bratt and Baker are pretty unmemorable. Stamp adds a bit of supposed weight to the film but really only spins some philosophy and then croaks!Overall this is not an awful film just a pretty pointless one.  The film is neither exciting nor interesting.  The combination of ideas just seems like a basic plot was added to until it had enough to fill the running time with stuff.  If you have to see one of the two Mars movies from this year, I'd suggest Mission to Mars is better (albeit not great either).

It's in the face of this that you still have to realize it's a clever story, as I said. The plot twists are intelligent and well-timed, not of the sort that you can foresee. At times you wouldn't even see something's coming at all. It does catch you off guard, and that's very good. And the way the story develops shows interesting angles on a number of basic subjects including murder, love, survival and so on. It's a sci-fi, but while there are some cool things to show for the fans of the genre, too (take the landing scene for an example), perhaps it has more to offer on human relationships. Still, as a space movie, too, it's very imaginative and could be likened, say, to a future Apollo 13 mission with no guarantees of anyone making it back - remember, it hasn't taken place yet.

In fact, my country is now one of the world's biggest supporters of the United States. But this comment was just silly! Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russians were always ahead of the Americans in terms of space technology, and this includes American (i.e. German) rocketry*. To name only a few records they hold, they put the first satellite in space (Sputnik 1), the first probe to the far side of the moon, the first probe to Mars... And they did a far better job at keeping a scientific agenda behind their activities; they had the capabilities to send men to the moon much before the Americans, but their procedures called for sending an automated probe to do any job before a human was sent.The American Apollo programme, however, was only concerned with showing up the Russians, by bypassing time-consuming safety procedures, and blindly charging on towards their scientifically redundant goal of landing a man of the moon--even when their rockets blew up, killing the astronauts on whom they had spent millions of dollars to train.*About that comment on German rocketry, try googling Wernher von Braun. He was the German scientist who headed the Nazis' rocket programme during World War II, which put the first rockets into practical production. These were used to bomb London, and killed many civilians. When the Russians were nearing Berlin, the German scientists were terrified, and decided to surrender themselves to the Americans. Then, against all international laws, the American government, without hesitation, paid these men large sums of money and offered them international protection, turning a blind eye to their parts in killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, so that they would build for them a space programme that would show up the Russians'.American engineering? Unfortunately, whatever marvels America claims to have brought to the world were conceived and designed by foreigners.

There is a similar attempt to create a sense of realism in space technology which even includes 2001 style rotating toroid centrifuges. A contribution to which being 2001 style inclusion of corporate logos ( e.g. Toshiba ). There is a referential HAL moment when the robot AMEE watches the crew discussing her destruction and decides not to cooperate. There are attempts at a spiritual profoundity in the philosophising of the character played by Terence Stamp ( who I invariably confuse with Jeremy Irons ). However, there is a fundamental polar opposition between the two movies.Kubrick declared that he wanted to make the proverbial good science fiction movie. In other words, something fundamentally distinct from the regular B-movie efforts of the fifties and early sixties, such as The Conquest of Space or Forbidden Planet. A work that would be thoroughly researched and designed from the facts up, rather than starting with an adventure scenario and then hanging picturesque design around it. In that ambition, Kubrick undoubtedly succeeded. there is nothing in 2001 that does not make scientific or technological sense.On the other hand, Red Planet represents the modern equivalent of exactly the kind of movie that Kubrick was seeking to render history. From the very beginning, as it sets out in the use of an intrusive narration which Kubrick specifically denounced as un-cinematic. A narration which outlines a completely ridiculous scenario that the mission to Mars was part of a plan to find a new home for Earth's 12 billion people. So, are they going to ferry 12 billion people to Mars? The use of an airbag lander, whilst topically derived from that seen on the Pathfinder Mars probe landed at the time of the movie is technically inconceivable for a manned vehicle. In fact, NASA has already abandoned the device, planning in the next round of missions to break the vehicle's descent and hover it at 10 metres altitude. By contrast, the landing in Red Planet is mind-bogglingly crude. Admittedly, this was portrayed as an emergency measure. But who designs an emergency measure that we know 80 years beforehand will not work? Then there is that emergency. An emergency, OK, in any plot that can be thrown in. But here we have in fact SEVEN unexpected emergencies all occurring in the space of a few minutes The solar flare radiation burst, the fire resulting, the loss of orbital stability due to atmospheric venting, the fire in the descender requiring jettison of the undercarriage, the bad landing on the back up system, the fact that it's miles from target and that that base in itself has been unexpectedly shredded.On the other hand, we also have a string of ridiculously implausible strokes of good fortune. For a start, that the crew just happen to be within walking distance of an ancient radio. Then that they are ALSO within walking distance of a Russian vehicle. Then the weird fact that the ascender on the Russian vehicle had not been used. Even though it turns out to have been entirely usable! So we have three landing points within walking distance of each other on an entire planet.Added to which we must wonder why an unmanned sample vehicle would have aboard it an operating console with a VDU and Windows-like user-friendly operating system complete with decorative GIF's?Then we have the fundamental premise that environmental calamity spells doom for humanity. Many thing's pose a hazard to our future. Many reasons exist to explore space. But atmospheric pollution and global warming are not one connecting to the other.On the other hand, the idea that the Terraforming of Mars could produce a breathable atmosphere in less than a few centuries of activity, Nematodes or no Nematodes, is daft beyond measure. And what about the atmospheric pressure? Where did all the extra atmosphere come from? These things aside, the movie is very nicely designed. The space suits are great. They remind me of the designs for Zero X in Century 21 comic, circa 1967. The sound of conversations within the helmet is very atmospheric.Best of all is the robot, superbly threatening and vividly realised. I would expect that in the distant time that this movie is set this might be the only feature of it that doesn't appear ludicrously old-fashioned.Regard this movie as our present-day equivalent of an old sci-fi B-movie and just enjoy the fun. Otherwise, reflect on how little progress there has been in cinema since 1968 ( when 2001 was released ), if any. Above all, Red Planet is much better than the risible Mission to Mars that came out at about the same time.

It has excellent set and costume design, great special effects and future-tech porn, some nice plot gimmicks, and some strong performances. But boy, does it have problems.1)The attempts to discuss the role of faith and belief in Gawd vs. science and technology fall flat and display all the depth and insight of a Bazooka Joe comic. Even a magnificent actor like Terence Stamp can't make the theme work with the tin-foil depth of the ideas in the dialog and character exchanges here. If the writer and director really wanted to pursue this idea, they should have had Stamp's character go at it with Tom Sizemore's character for 5 or 10 minutes. That would have been something to see, even if it did bring the movie to a halt. You can say that this theme is hard to do justice to in a Sci-Fi Adventure film. I say that if they couldn't do the theme justice, they shouldn't have brought it up.2) I don't believe the character interactions and dynamics for a second. Val Kilmer's character (the 'space janitor') is made a figure of fun, and jeered at by the co-pilot and geneticist, when he's the one that keeps the SHIP running? I DON'T THINK SO. Tom Sizemore's character makes a lewd remark toward the ship's female commander in the middle of a mission under military command and isn't shot, clapped in irons or kicked in the balls? Not in a million years. The terraforming expert turns out to be a 'weak sister' and tries to leave the surviving crew members behind after he 'accidentally' kills one? Oh, please! 3) Many, many plot holes. We've got this multi-billion dollar vessel built for months of travel in deep space, but it can't handle a burst of hard radiation from the sun, which fries its circuits. What were they expecting in deep space? April showers? NASA somehow deposits an automated, self-sustaining habitat station on Mars previous to the manned mission, but doesn't equip it with any alarms or signals or status monitors to make sure it is online and working...and also doesn't equip it with any CAMERAS to show the forces that destroyed it. Wouldn't NASA put some external sensors on the stupid thing if it was that important to the mission? The crew wears high tech space suits that closely monitor their vital signs, etc...but apparently the suits can't tell if there is any oxygen in the atmosphere around them, so they almost asphyxiate before the big plot twist 40-50 minutes in. Wouldn't that be a handy function for a space suit, so you'd know when it was safe to take your helmet off in an airlock ? And that's just the what I thought of in 2 minutes.4) Some really annoying performances in the first half of the movie. Tom Sizemore and Benjamin Bratt are king sized irritations and distractions in most early scenes. This could be a function of the conceited blow-hard characters they play, but every time they were on screen, I wanted to thump their heads against the nearest wall. This was probably a deliberate choice on the part of the director, but the fact remains that I liked Sizemore in other parts, but I hate him here, at least for the first half of the movie. And Bratt is a good looking guy, but gives the least nuanced performance in the film. Saving graces Terence Stamp exudes tremendous dignity and gravitas for the limited time he is in the film. I want to grow up to be just like him. Sizemore's character redeems himself and turns out to be something of a hero. The scenes where the lander attempts entry and crashes have a nice stomach churning intensity. The scenes where Moss is attempting to jury-rig the damaged ship back into operating condition have a lot of energy and are very 'Apollo 13' in feel. The war/recon robot moves nicely and convincingly, and is very scary and intimidating - you really do believe that it could kill the entire crew in seconds without any fuss. Kilmer has several great lines which he delivers well, especially near the end when he is trying to jumpstart the Soviet lander.Not in the same league as 2001 or even 2010. But if you must watch a recently made movie about Mars and you aren't too choosy, this one looks great and is good, shallow fun.

Owing to unspecified problems with pollution, humanity is doomed to extinction within a short time unless Mars can be colonised. Lest there should be any doubt about whether the extinction of humanity would be a good idea or not, the cast of characters includes a philosopher who is there to tell us that it certainly wouldn't be. What would happen to History? What about art and music? and what about people who died for freedom? If humanity disappeared, it would all be for nothing! Well yeah, good point, never thought of that. Neither, apparently, have the folks at Houston, who only provide one manned mission, one spacecraft, no back-ups, no measuring equipment for use on arrival on Mars, in fact very little beyond a robot hound that switches to Military Mode (i.e. attack your companions mode) as soon as its circuitry is jarred. But it turns out that, silly as it is, this 2001 HAL rehash is actually the only halfway interesting element in a puzzlingly bad movie, which breaks every beginner-level screenwriting rule in the book for no apparent reason beyond a strange kind of deathwish.For example, the old don't tell, show!, found in the first chapter of every writing manual I've come across, receives short shrift in the first two minutes of this movie, where we are _told_, by the ship's commander-cum-narrator, what each crew member's salient personality trait is for the remainder of the film. Which is just as well, because the acting is so lifeless that without these character sketches it would be hard to tell the male leads apart. The same complaint could be levelled at the plot, which shows very little other than a lack of direction and control. If you are going to rework _Alien_ and have your characters picked off one by one by a terrifying foe, make it ONE terrifying foe and not an apparently random confluence of killer robot, bad temper, bad luck, nasty prawns and a ruptured spleen. Some of the plot elements are potentially strong enough to support a certain amount of interest and atmospheric tension - the mystery of the disappearing algae, the sinister and brooding presence of Life On Mars, the nemesis robot, the guilty conscience of one crew member - but there is no overriding shape to the plot which gives any one of these elements enough prominence at the right time for it to really impact the audience. Every time something new happens, there is a sense of a desperate scriptwriter reaching out for the next fallback fix to stave away boredom. Hence we get cliche after hackneyed cliche - the bumpy crash-landing, the heroic you guys go on without me (_twice_), the homicidal robot, the race against time (at least three races against time, for good measure), etc. Last I looked, there was a little more to creating a film than just assembling a checklist of ingredients that worked in other films and throwing them all together in a hopeful pile.Yet that's all this film does. And it contains enough hilarious gaffes (e.g. the puzzling solar flare that reaches out to Mars but misses Earth, the walking-distance proximity of all these old but still-working space probes, the insect-like Nematodes, the killer robot that conveniently has second thoughts first time around, the ludicrous suggestion that people in 2057 will have web sites and listen to The Police and the Stones, the breathable atmosphere that somehow went undetected by all previous missions, etc etc) to make this a kind of landmark in bad science fiction. For that alone, and for the red-tinted photography and the camp cuteness of robot AIMEE's disco moves, I suppose I can stretch to a 1 out of 10. But that's being kind. If you have a choice between seeing this film and watching a line of ants carry a currant-cake crumb from behind your fridge to a crack in the wall, go for option 2.

About halfway through the film, for example, there is a lengthy scene of completely false tension, where the three survivors are helplessly watching their oxygen timers count slowly down to zero, knowing that they have nowhere to go and nothing to do but wait to suffocate. Obviously, we know throughout this entire scene that all they have to do is take off their helmets and start breathing, because if they die like that the movie's over. I suppose some tension might be derived from the fact that THEY don't know they can breathe the air on Mars yet, but since we're a thinking audience, a scene like this falls flat because we already know they're going to survive.I liked some of the things in the movie. It was pretty interesting when they finally arrived at the base on Mars and found that it had been completely destroyed, and the conflict was introduced very early as the ship begins to break apart as soon as they arrive into Mars' atmosphere, forcing the team to split up for the rest of the movie, but then you realize that every bit of power failed on the ship and yet they still have gravity.Earth has become so polluted that humankind needs a new home, and nations around the world have combined their knowledge and money and space travel capabilities to launch this completely English speaking crew into space to test out the possibility of humans someday living on Mars. Algae has been launched there over a period of twenty years to try to build up an atmosphere of oxygen, but all the algae seems to have disappeared, and one of the mission's objectives is to find out why. I like that they came up with an interesting reason for the algae having disappeared, but I don't like the fact that the screenplay pretends that there can be breathable oxygen on Mars, while an entire Earthful of humans are sending up a manned spacecraft into the atmosphere and don't realize it. Missions like this are not cheap. No spacecraft, manned or not, is sent to another planet without extremely detailed knowledge of that planet's atmosphere.(spoilers) That was a hell of an oversight, but I liked that the movie didn't just have them meet some hugely disappointing Martians for our heroes to escape, but the villain that IS presented, while creative in a sense, is even worse. The mission included an exploration robot named AMEE, which for some reason comes with a `Military Mode.' I guess this is done in case they should run into any Martian terrorists during the mission. And since AMEE comes equipped with detailed knowledge of the weaknesses of human anatomy, it seems that her designers were concerned about HUMAN Martian terrorists. Not a lot of thought put into this aspect of the movie. Obviously, not a SINGLE person on the crew sent to Mars read the sticker on the back of AMEE, which clearly read, `WARNING SEVERE SHOCK OR JARRING OF THIS ROBOT WILL IMMEDIATELY TURN HER INTO A TERMINATRIX.' On top of that, Red Planet contains probably the biggest loose end that I've seen left loose in a movie since Planet of the Oops in 2001. Evidently some multi-cellular organisms have evolved on the surface of Mars (feeding on massive fields of algae, yet another thing that the stupid humans on earth didn't notice), that eat just about anything digestible that they come into contact with. Two crew members are lost to them, but not before two of them (note, the number required for breeding) can be captured in a steel capsule to be taken back to earth and studied. Just before one crew member succumbs to the little critters, he tosses the capsule to the one member surviving(Gallagher, played by Val Kilmer), insisting that he bring it back to earth with him.At this point, it's perfectly natural to expect that they would have one more uprising just before the end of the movie, or that they would stow away on the ship and create havoc on Earth, like that spider did in Arachnophobia, traveling back to America in that coffin. Instead, Gallagher takes the capsule and the creatures are gone from the story completely as though they were never even there. When the crew took off their helmets and found a breathable atmosphere that no one ever knew about until then, I thought THAT was an oversight, but this, THIS violates even the most basic rules of story writing. One of the first things that you learn about writing stories is that every scene must have a reason for being in the story. If it doesn't, take it out. The fact that the creatures play no role in the outcome of the movie renders their existence in the movie meaningless beyond just having some fancy special effects showing some creative Martian creature. There is so much that could have been done with those animals, which is why it was so disappointing to see them just disappear like that. Things like that are only excusable in movies that promise sequels, or movies that show the creatures remaining as a way to signify an amusing false sense of security, like in Little Shop of Horrors. I just don't really foresee much chance of a sequel to Red Planet.As a science fiction film, Red Planet is entertaining and fun, but there are oversights like the ones I've mentioned that just show that not much thought was put into the screenplay, and something like that alone can completely ruin an otherwise decent movie. The performances all around are more than satisfactory, there is a lot of focus on characterization and the interaction of the crew members and the problems that can arise from questions of trust and questions of faith in machinery that has never been properly tested before the mission (since it was never sent into space until the mission), but there's nothing worse than being impressed by some parts of a movie and slapping your forehead about other parts.The movie provides a great Martian landscape, it contains a thrilling landing scene, in which the pod carrying all of the crew members sprouts huge air bags on all sides to provide for a relatively soft landing, only to roll right off a cliff, and there is even a question of God and religion to add to the complexity of the plot, but there are unfortunate shortcomings that really slow the movie down and prevent it from being as good as it should have been. The talent was there during the production, it just seems like both the script and the final film needed to spend a little more time in the editing room.

Robbie Gallagher is the most developed character in the movie and Kilmer plays him wonderfully as a quirky, likable guy.  Moss' Commader Bowman and Stamp's Chantilas are the other interesting characters.  Unfortunately, Chantilas is the first to die.  Being a likeable character, a later death would have been more effective on the audience.  The remaining crew members are all flawed or have annoying character traits, so we don't regret seeing them go at all.The story itself suffers from the fact that they've tried to make it too dramatic.  In the opening of the movie we learn that Earth is polluted and dying, resulting in our need to colonize Mars.  If I recall correctly the movie is set in the 2020's.  That's far to near the present time to be credible.  There's no way that we're going to pollute the planet to that point in 20 years. Once on Mars the team has trouble with their recon drone, AIMEE.  When the drone reverts to military mode and starts killing the team, it's a little like every Alien rip off we've seen, but she does get rid of several of those annoying crew members, so it's all good in the end.Whatever short comings Red Planet may have, it's an enjoyable Science Fiction movie that tries to keep grounded in reality.  The technology presented in the film doesn't seem that different from what we have today, which helps our suspension of disbelief, which is having difficulty believing that Earth is dying 20 years from now.  Val Kilmer and Carrie-Anne Moss make a good duo, and the film may have benefitted from giving the two more screen time together.  If you're a fan of Science Fiction, Kilmer or Moss, check out the movie. "},{"Title":"What We Should Do When We Go To Mars.

The story is really boring, and the quality of its moral content can not cover the lack of any real action. A few words about the story would be well in place, I consider. Some spoilers in the sentences and phrases which will follow of course.    We have this crew, on this rather unspectacular looking spaceship, which has the destination Mars. Problems appear when they have to leave the ship, and despite the fact that the situation on board the SS seems to be lost, it is not so, and at the end, incredibly the spaceship is the only way out.   The few losers who get to go on Mars have their amount of trouble...base is all wrecked, one of them is a coward, and of course we get some pesky Mars bugs.    At one point we get to find out that their only way out is a Russian probe, or something like that, which didn't get to get back to earth. As usually there's a problem here to. Only two men fit in the thing, and we have three guys in distress.! From my point of view, this problem never existed. It was so obvious only two or less would get to the thing...and the problems weren't over there either, but of course we get a happy end.     So, after this story which is worth 0$, you would have the actors, which sadly do not compensate for the 0$ worth story. Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss...nothing! It's the same thing.

For once we get a science-fiction movie with a female star, who does not go out of her way to out-macho the males.

Easy-to-get-along shipmates. Clear headed well-trained and well-informed crew who obey instantly the commander's orders when the emergency comes, without unduly questioning her authority or competence.Except for hero-sole-survivor Val Kilmer's antics, I find the behaviours of most actors quite believable, within the circumstances.Indeed, there have been countless precedents for the injured older scientist with a ruptured spleen to urge his crewmates to leave him and go on.One guy getting angry at another, and accidentally pushing him over the edge, is common behaviour.  Doing it literally - over a cliff - is a bit much.  But still within the realm of done things on Earth. So I applaud the writer who insured the man's remorse came out in the form of over-sensitivity, while the three survivors covered from the storm in a makeshift cave.The only hard-to-believe part was the behaviour of the mechanical rover AMEE. That she would have been implanted with a dual chip, giving her an alternate warrior behaviour, is consistent with what the world now expects the violence-crazed Americans to do.But there the logic fails. If/when accidentally activated, the violence chip would act at once, and totally.  Not play games, through harming one, going away, and then stalking the three survivors.  That artificial-to-the-internal-logic-of-the-story sub-scenario only aimed to prolong the suspense, and to provide hero Val Kilmer with a clever way to obtain a source of power (to start the launch sequence of the Russian exploratory vessel) when he would need it.

The misadventures begin when NASA chooses a crew that can be portrayed by Val Kilmer, Ben Bratt, or Carrie Ann Moss. But these brave explorers MUST be competent, cuz they all have one name like Madonna or Prince, names like Gallagher(no sledge-o-matic though), Burchenal, Pettengil, Chantilas, and Massengil. I thought maybe the names were anagrams for Crappy ass movie but no such luck.For the first six months of the mission, things are relatively uneventful, which already strains the suspension of disbelief. I for one know that being trapped on an enclosed space vessel with Val Kilmer for six months would shred all vestiges of MY sanity. One more African cave story Val and so help me... These pre-Mars scenes are used to establish non-character. Terence Stamp, much better as General Zod or in the Limey, comes across as cold and rather robotic, despite being described as the SOUL of the mission HA ha, we know this movie has no soul. Surpassing Stamp as detached is Moss, the mission leader, an actress born to play a corpse. And then there was Kilmer. Looking like he just encountered a swarm of angry bees, the unusually puffy Kilmer turns in his stock I don't know what planet I'm on, let alone what movie performance. The others are expendable from the get-go, Benjamin Mr. Julia Roberts, at the time and the wimpy guy. Argh, just recounting these scenes is hurting me.Immediately upon reaching Mars things go from contrived to worse. A gamma-elf-flare whatever totally wrecks the ship, forcing all the men down to the planet and leaving moss to tend the homestead. They boof the landing thanks to hotshot pilot(is there any other kind?)Bratt, and Stamp ruptures his spleen fatally. Now terribly low on oxygen, the survivors try and make it to the pre-established Mars base, only to find it trashed (probably by Martian delinquents). While they're waiting to die of suffocation, Wimpy knocks Bratt off a cliff and...geez...I could go on...but...disaster after disaster, any one of which could be the basis of a movie, carnivorous exploding fireflies, a vicious ice-storm, and IMHO the lamest an ex-military robot that gets set on kill and goes after the astronauts. I mean, why leave the killemall programming on the mars probe robot? Couldn't the space have been used for something better?Maybe the filmmakers thought this convoy of mayhem made for an exciting adrenaline roller coaster of thrills! as Joe Blow of the Houma Examiner might say, but personally, it just was lame and sad. At the end, when Kilmer actually flicks off Mars and goes F**k this planet I am in complete agreement with him. I am Kilmer and he is me. This ain't no Robinson Crusoe on Mars folks, at least that had a monkey and Adam West. Peace.

The misuse of the term Nematodes (non-segmented worms) had me groaning, quite apart from the rest of the gaffes (like the wrong symbolic letters for the amino acids involved in DNA).I'd almost swear there was a hidden agenda here - the spiritual comments coupled with the poor science shriek of something being (not quite) peddled, as if someone wanted to do a bit of science-bashing but couldn't quite get their facts straight.  I half expected the old (and very wrong) chestnut about Man being descended from monkeys to be hauled out for an airing... (The suggestion is that Man and Apes have a common ancestor, in case you were wondering).Terence Stamp always does an excellent job of being Bad, so it was a little disconcerting to find him as a philosopher here - a little like finding Bob Hoskins, the best London gangster ever, in a movie as a priest (A Prayer for the Dying).I'd have found this film a little more credible if Terence had been an antagonist, but perhaps he was trying out a new persona.  He managed that quite well, I thought, in Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (another Oz-based movie).Since the film was shot on location in Coober Pedy in Australia, my guess is that Val Kilmer's red face may have been partly due to the climate, but either way it was a departure from his usual good-looks type roles and an interesting experiment if it was.Carrie-Anne Moss I remember from the Matrix (a movie that merits being seen several times in order to understand everything clearly, which isn't the case for this film) but this was no Matrix role for her.  Somehow her character wasn't quite believable - nothing like Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in Alien et seq.The film also lacked the kind of macho action (not my favorite) that might have been expected from the writers, given their credits - not a patch on Predator or Terminator, although in some respects the elements were there (just not exploited).All in all, not an atrocious movie (not so bad as to be B-A-D), but not a really good piece of entertainment either.

But even though you have a pretty good idea how it's going to end, it's still interesting to watch. Red Planet still has some genuinely suspenseful moments despite it's predictability.The characters are probably not as developed as they should be, but they are more developed than a standard summer action movie. There were a few times when characters were talking that I felt like the audience should have learned more from the scene that they did. That makes those scenes go by a little slowly. There is some character development that works a little better though. And when there is action, it's well done. Also, all of the actors do a pretty good job. Carrie-Anne Moss falters a bit near the end, but that's my only complaint about the acting.Technically speaking, Red Planet is extremely well done. The Martian landscapes are incredibly well done.

Mission to Mars is a not-too-far-in-the-future movie about an expedition to Mars in order to investigate the nearby mysterious... have I already said that? )Well, Mission to Mars may have a better plot than Red Planet, but that's piece of cake, 'cause Red Planet has NO plot at all. I mean, in the first movie, all the religious background and the moral intention are quite interesting, also the end. But in Red Planet there's no more plot than landing in Mars, fighting with robots and aliens, and escaping from the planet. That's all, I have resumed the film in one sentence. Pretty plain, isn't it?Talking about the characters, in Mission to Mars, Brian de Palma focuses the action in the characters, their feelings, their religious thoughts... So we could consider this science-fiction film also moral, with sensibility. On the other hand, Red Planet is more high-tech, with robots, spaceships, aliens, etc., more popcorn movie.And finally the special effects, Red Planet wins in this part, because all the interesting thing of the film is centered on the special effects. AMEE, the expedition robot, is brilliant, and also the spaceship, the Mars surface and the martian lifeform too. That's the good point of Red Planet. However, Mission to Mars also has quite good SFX, but don't shine like in the other production.So, after going through all the differences, we must conclude in one thing Both films aren't brilliant, they aren't interesting and cool enough to keep the audience IN the action. I have seen both film at home, and that's what I think about these two films, to watch at home, better if someone pay the rent of the films for you! 6/10 "},{"Title":"THIS IS PURE WASTE OF TIME","Date":"22 June 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  I thought mission to mars and alien ressurection were bad,but this one is even worse,it has a great cast that has a small participation,terence stamp has a 6 minute participation and carrie anne moss is there just to get the audience to the theaters.The Mars scenes are pathetic,they look like as if they were shot at the grand canyon,and the special effects...sorry...special defects are the worse since jason and the argonauts,the plot looks like it was made by an 11 year old child,the great villain of the film is a broken robot called amee,bla bla bla bla bla bla,how does films like these manage to get out of paper?i do not know,neither i want to.

But I would like to complain about some aspects of it.  What follows may seem irrelevant at first, but trust me.A few years ago I bought a small, rechargeable hand-held vacuum cleaner.  The nickel-cadmium batteries have long since worn out, and will no longer hold a charge.  I opened up the device, removed the battery pack, wrote down whatever numbers were printed on it, and searched the Internet for replacements.  It proved a daunting task to figure out the vital matters of size, voltage, configuration, etc.  I had plenty of time to search, but I never quite found a site that offered the means to get it right.  This is a simple household appliance we are talking about.Now imagine being on an alien planet, hunted by a murderous robot, trying to figure out instructions in Russian (which you don't understand) on the energy requirements of a complex piece of foreign space hardware with which you are absolutely unfamiliar.  You extract a battery from said robot while it is trying to kill you, with the intent of using it on the foreign space vehicle about which you know nothing and whose directions you can't read.  Because you are running out of time, and have only a minute or two to work on it, you cannot consult with anyone else about the battery problem.  What are the odds that the battery could even be connected with, let along match the voltage requirements for, the Russian space hardware?  I'm obviously not a techno-geek, and I think my ability to suspend disbelief is greater than average, but due to personal experiences this example of ludicrously-stretched credibility irked me particularly.Another complaint I have about `Red Planet' is the characterizations of the crew members, an assortment of eccentric, moody young jerks that would not be out of place in a `Real World' episode.  It is obvious from the scenario of `Red Planet' that space travel is still considered a highly dangerous occupation.  That being the case, the collection of immature, wise-ass stereotypes depicted would never be chosen for the task at hand.  The exception to this is Chantilas, played by Terence Stamp, who is dispatched early and in the least dramatic way possible, so that the young and hunky space-dreamboats in the film can more easily dominate it.The costumes, scenic designs, and effects are generally good, but the digitally created robot and swarming bugs effects were not really convincing.  Eight years ago `Jurassic Park' featured digital creatures that looked like they existed and moved in the real world.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen it done quite as well again since then, and these digital effects, while rendered well, look almost as cartoon-like in their movements as cell animation.Overall, not as annoying as `Mission to Mars,' but not the excellent science fiction film many people are looking for.  Too bad.

I think this would have been a really good movie if the pace and tension had been increased about 20%. There were some surprises but at times I could predict what was going to happen for the next 30 seconds or so. Even so, there were a lot of little things that made me like this movie the cast, the special effects / eye candy, the sense of desolation on Mars, the way the characters interacted, and most of all, the little animated astronaut bear.It's no masterpiece but it's pretty good; I wouldn't want to pay $17+ to see it in a theater but I'd recommend it for a rental under $5.

Well I think this was mentioned in the movie as well, but there is water on Mars. Terra forming of Mars has been talked about a lot, and algae was one possibility. Some one thought it was convenient that they got the radio. I was actually impressed by this, as the Mars Rover project (where they got the /modem/radio from) was fairly recent. Someone said that they crashed near the habitat. I don't call 40 or 50 km near at all. I think the story did a good job explaining things. The ship was untested, as was everything with it. The things that went wrong make sense. The fire scene was very well done. I don't normally respond to the jibes that films get here, but I felt most of these were unfair. One of the roles of sci-fi is to show possible solutions for future problems. I think Red Planet took that to heart. To call it bad sci fi is just not fair. To be quite truthful, and I know I am going to get flamed for this, Star Wars was a story set in space, Red Planet was a story about space.

For example, someone complained that the dates don't add up.  Well, the film says that by the year 2000 it was becoming obvious that we were poisoning the Earth (it is), and then the film is set in the year 2050, and it says terraforming has been going for 20 years prior.  That seems plausible.  Someone complained about the warming of Mars, but this was explained by one of the characters in the scene where they are running out of oxygen in their suits.  The film shouldn't be expected to explain all this, but it did.  The coincidence of the chosen landing site being relatively close to some previous probes' landing sites seemed all too convenient, and this was never explained, but there are plausible explanations maybe it was intentional, to supply the crew with some extra resources, or maybe this was just a good area of Mars for landings (but look out for the cliffs!)My biggest nitpick with the film is that a nematode is a worm, and the PhD in Genetic Engineering who identified non-worm creatures as nematodes should have known better.My other big problem with the film is its implausible sequence of disasters.  Most recent films seem to suffer from this.  Like in Perfect Storm, it's not enough that your boat gets hit by a big storm - prior to that you also have to suffer through a man overboard due to a freak accident, a great white shark *onboard*, and a rare rogue wave.  Well, same thing here, you suffer radiation from a solar flare and later the destruction of everything you need to survive, and as if surviving on an alien world with no food and no water is not hard enough, you also find yourself under attack from some of your own equipment.  Come on.Speaking of no water, why weren't they eating/drinking the ice that rained down in the ice storm?  It was water ice, wasn't it, or was it carbon dioxide ice?Let's focus on the positives.  The computer images of the planets and spaceship are absolutely gorgeous, and the computer animation of the 'bot does a better job of suspending your disbelief than the old stop-motion model filming like in Terminator(1).  As far as science fiction films go, this one is above average - not nearly as good as the Matrix, but not nearly as bad as Mission to Mars or Screamers.  The acting is good.  The exotic beauty of Carrie-Anne Moss is a bonus. (I wonder if her exotic looks may be Marfan Syndrome.)  The core of the plot is vaguely plausible.  The repeated theme of no, no, you go on without me and self-sacrifice is interesting, along with the contrast with the selfish approach.  Go in with low expectations and optionally a suspension-of-disbelief ale, and you may enjoy it.

Val Kilmer leads an impressive but wasted cast as a member of a group of cosmonauts in the year 2057 who embark on a mission to the red planet to find out what exactly happened to a backfired atmospheric reorganizing project initiated by terraformers twenty years prior. A few of the usual pitfalls ensue power failures, lack of natural resources and everything getting saved in the nick of time before the clock counts to zero, but apart from that, there's not really all that much that happens. How can you possibly make a multi-million dollar film about five people on Mars and still manage to have them do nothing but sit around? Even the deaths of the various lesser members of the cast seem incidental and happenstance more than integral parts of a scary story. If the characters were being explored in even the most meager of fashions perhaps the mellowness of it all would be more forgivable, but as it seems that all the actors are just posing for the cameras until their agents can get their hands on some better quality scripts there's really not much to do except bear it with them. Val Kilmer does a hackneyed job of his character, at once putting on a ridiculous voice to signify that he's a high school geek but at the same time building his musculature up (and then saying somewhere in the film that he's not a jock; WHATEVER!) and spray-painting his hair a Euroclub blonde. A subplot about a robot that goes haywire tries to preach about the dangers of giving morality to artificial intelligence, but as the machine is injured in a fall (instead of actually choosing to go bad) this also begins to be more of an excuse to kill time instead of teach anybody a lesson. Even if Mission To Mars' plot outcome was the most ridiculously inane thing to happen in a movie all year, at least something happened in it. The filmmakers also committed the dire sin of casting ultracool action babe Carrie-Anne Moss as the commander of the spaceship and then leaving her trapped in a room for the ENTIRE film!! WHHAAAT? One gets the impression the film would actually have been interesting had she been allowed to get down onto the red earth and be among the people. Oh well, better luck next time.

Unfortunately, they have rather sabotaged their own efforts by concentrating the core of the movie on an uninteresting intergalactic shipwreck story which descends in due course towards an tiresome exercise in guessing which crew-member is next for an unpleasant death at the hands of an angry, unseen enemy (An enemy, which in the end, seems to have escaped from an old X-Files episode).  Simply, the script doesn't actually give the cast anything dramatic or engaging to work with - Terence Stamp should really stay away from working in SF blockbusters, as Red Planet gives him about as much to do as George Lucas did in Star Wars Episode One.  Similarly, Benjamin Bratt and Tom Sizemore are decidedly in the shadow of Val Kilmer, their Nasa-lite Brainiac science fellas being shown-up and out-witted constantly by the lead actor's deadpan, near-narcoleptic, slacker 'Space Janitor'.   High points?  Well Carrie Anne Moss fans (There are an increasing number of us) will delight at her splendidly tough-minded, smart and independent turn as the mission leader - Sensibly, the filmmakers cut back frequently to her attempts to save a crippled ship hanging in orbit above Mars, perhaps realizing that this sub-plot should have been the major focus of the film.  Noticeably, the effects and production design here are eye-popping and vastly more interesting than the dull goings-on planet-side.Overall, a wasted opportunity, but one that might be worth a look on the no doubt imminent DVD release.

Right from the beginning, we are shown how much we're going to have to suspend our disbelief in order for this film to work. Terraforming Mars in a matter of a couple of decades in order to provide an alternate place for ten billion humans to live is hysterical enough, but the idea that the leaders of the year 2050 wouldn't attempt to seed more than one planet is ridiculous.I'm about to reveal key elements of the plot, so don't come crying to me if you haven't seen the film and read past this point. You might actually thank me for it later, anyway.The idea of a landing module hitting the surface of any planet from that far into the stratosphere without killing every passenger within is too ridiculous to contemplate. That is why the Apollo landing modules all had retro-firing rockets for use during their landing sequences. A gravitational force of less than half that produced by Earth might not seem like much when one is walking on the surface of the planet, but it is a hell of a lot to anyone who happens to be stuck inside a landing module that has been dropped from the outmost extreme of that planet's atmosphere. I'm not the only one who laughed aloud when Terence Stamp was the only actor to be written out with a ruptured spleen. And what was up with the tiny amount of oxygen that the astronauts brought with them? As far as I can remember, the original moon landing brought enough oxygen for at least twice as much time as they actually spent there.Roger Ebert is right - this is just a typically hole-riddled 1950s plot with a 2000 budget. It's silly, it's goofy, it has all the thought of an episode from Beverly Hills 90210. I could have written them a better script than the alcoholic babboons they obviously used. But there's more than enough eye-candy (Carrie-Anne Moss' only real reason for being in the film) to keep the interest level above minimal.

Whether these are a natural gift or an acquisition remains a mystery.  However, Ms. Moss allows them to be displayed in a manner indicative of a proud new owner.  They are just about the only thing that keeps the movie alive during its final third.  However, since a ship in deep space on emergency power is likely to be COLD, not hot (Witness APPOLLO 13), Moss braless under a thin tee shirt seems more a dramatic ruse than anything else. RED PLANET is strictly stock characters and formulamatic plot.  I imagine the screenwriters though they were being cleaver naming Moss's character Bowman, but a reference to 2001 makes this film seem even more lame than before. The film has great special effects.  Too back there are too many illogical elements driving those effects (More about that in the SPOILERS section). NOTE TO CGI technicians  Next time you create a CGI robot, remember to program in some mass and inertia elements.  AMEE, the robot of RED PLANET, moves like a cross between a dog, a scorpion, and ALIEN.CAUTION  SPOILERS AHEADWhat really ruins RED PLANET is the stupidity of its plotting.  Just prior to entering Mars orbit, the ship encounters a solar flare powerful enough to nearly destroy it.  Since Mars is MUCH further away from the Sun than Earth, shouldn't this flare have done enough damage here first to have Earth send a signal to the spaceship immediately before it arrived at Mars?  Of course, were the flare only in the DIRECTION of Mars, Earth would be undamaged.  HOWEVER, Earth stations should still have sent a warning.  MOST CRUCIAL is the malfunction of AMEE. Hasn't anyone in Hollywood heard of a remote control ON / OFF switch? Kilmer should have had one on his arm viewer.  Besides, it is MOST likely the Marines would have removed the search and destroy hardware from AMEE, because it would add weight, and the added cost of potential loss. Finally, we come to the Nematodes.  Since they consumed algae and EXCRETED oxygen (enough to make the air breathable), there should NEVER have been an initial loss or reduction of oxygen.  Certainly, once the Nematodes had produced enough oxygen to breathe, spectrascopic analysis from the earth or the spaceship would have indicated this.I give this movie a 6, based on the special effects and Tom Sizemore's witty performance.

Either it is a moderately successful attempt to be entertaining, or a really stupid excuse for a science fiction film. Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall is still the best film to ever be set on Mars, but with the competition that is out there right now, you could be forgiven for thinking this is only because nobody else can make a good one (this is not the case - Total Recall is excellent on its own merits).Things started off well enough. The explanation of what mankind has been doing up to the moment the film begins is concise, clear, and a plausible scenario, especially given the number of alternative engines that have been supressed in favour of the obsolete internal-combustion model. The flight to Mars was also well handled, with the usual arguments between crew members and methods used to cope with the isolation and boredom of being in the same spaceship for over six months being well handled. But something goes amiss once the crew reach Mars. SPOILER ALERT First of all, the solar flare. I realise that it would be hard to build a spacecraft that is everything-proof, especially when nobody has used one for the stated purpose before. But surely the designers would have anticipated some adverse environmental reactions from the planet and the solar radiation that bounces off it and made some allowances for it. After all, the whole mission supposedly carries the fate of humanity in its hands. If that was the sort of thing I was up against, I would have made sure the spacecraft could withstand the equivalent of a nuclear strike on an outdoor toilet.Then there's that landing module. I'm sure it was designed solely as an escape pod, but the first manned mission to the moon had better landing capabilities than that. People have rolled in cars for about a thousandth as many rotations and been killed by it, so the fact that only one astronaut comes out with a ruptured spleen while the others are perfectly fine is just an insult to the intelligence. A real group of human beings subjected to that much violent rolling and shaking would suffer too many complicated fractures for a single man to survive.Then there's AMEE. An exploration droid with an artifical intelligence that the astronauts must kill in order to get something necessary for their survival that is never mentioned again in the whole film. It then proceeds to go into battle mode and perform a series of ridiculous gymnastics in order to break a single astronaut's rib. I cannot remember the last time NASA built anything with a combat mode. Were they expecting to stumble onto the set of Total Recall or something? Had they cut this element out of the script before shooting and just stuck to the bugs, we would have had a much better film.Which brings me to the bugs. Bugs that eat the algae NASA tried to seed the planet with and excrete oxygen. A neat solution to the problem of oxygen limitations in the suits, but not a particularly credible one. The fact that these insectoid lifeforms also consume an unspecified tissue within the human body and excrete that as oxygen makes the AMEE robot all the more embarassingly redundant. And just how did they do all that damage to the colony structure that was set up for the astronauts' arrival? Do they eat steel and excrete that as oxygen as well? If they built AMEE in anticipation of hostile organisms, surely they would have been some kind of defense system into the colony.Don't even get me started on the method they use to escape Mars. The only thing I know of that was created in the 1970s that I expect to still work fifty years from that time is Black Sabbath's music.On the positive side, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and Carrie Anne Moss do well with what little they have been given. Tom Sizemore in particular lifts the standard of the film from a self-contradictory mess to a watchable human drama. Val Kilmer was only a step above phoning in his performance, but he does give the other actors reasonable feedback to base their peformances on, which is not an easy task. Carrie Anne Moss was mostly redundant, but her interaction with the ship's computer kept the entertainment factor in the film from going to waste. The special effects were well realised, and Coober Pedy really is an excellent choice as a location to film events that supposedly take place on a desert planet. These elements keep Red Planet watchable, but that really is about it - watchable.

I was sorely disappointed.There was acting, but a rushed script made for no characters to act, and in a last-breath attempt to give it some depth, it calls for Commander Bowman (Carrie-Anne Moss) to party au naturale in the head (bathroom) with Gallagher (Val Kilmer).  A sequence that did nothing for Commander Bowman's character except to add some sleeziness normally associated with predictable sci-fi/action thrillers, and was totally wrong for an actress the calibre of Carrie-Anne Moss.As for everyone else, just call them the equivalent of the Red-Shirted Crewmen in Star Trek, or the nameless uniformed guard that stands next to the villain in a cop film.If you're looking for dazzling special effects (save for a few simple technical fallacies having to do with physics in a zero-G environment), go ahead and see it.

Carrie-Anne, the Commander, saved the ship, made all the decisions and rescued Val Kilmer. Val Kilmer's character, a minor crew member, was the woman-in-peril who needs to be rescued. While crossing the desert, he whines that he cannot continue, and Moss needs to coax him to persevere. Val is allowed to be resourceful only near the end. Throughout the movie Val speaks in a passive almost feminine voice.The producers and directors were trying to create a fresh new sci-fi movie by reversing the sex roles. It didn't work.

I wanted to see this movie, but went in unenthusiastically, due to the poor advertising campaign.  The promotion surrounding this film made it look like it was about a killer robot, who turns on the crew, but this turned out to be only a small part of the story.  I also thought that the astronauts' spacesuits looked more retro (ie, Alien) than futuristic. However, RP turned out to have it's share of positives, and I enjoyed it much more than I expected.Mars is astoundingly convincing in this film.  It looks exactly like the pictures sent here from the Sojourner back in 1997, and the director thankfully takes his time showing us the caverns, rocks, and landscapes of the planet, much more so than 2000's earlier Mars-movie, Mission to Mars. It is very believable--if we didn't know better we'd think that the movie was shot there.  The colors and tint from the surrounding atmosphere are also quite accurately portrayed, according to what we know, of course. People might complain that there isn't much characterization in this movie, since the characters have standard motives and backgrounds.  But at least they have different and believable personalities, accompanied by decent performances.  This is especially true of Val Kilmer and the always reliable Tom Sizemore.SPOILER WARNING;SKIP THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!I was at first disappointed when the astronauts removed their helmets, and found the air breathable, as a result of the algae growing portion of the terraforming process.  Terraforming is a fascinating and possible concept that is extremely complicated.  It would probably take hundreds of years at the least to even get it started.  And even if there was oxygen on Mars, it would be too thin for humans to breathe.  The removal of space helmets also poses another serious danger--Mars' insubstantial ozone layer.  Standing on the surface of Mars, an unprotected human would freeze to death at the same time his blood boiled, or something to that effect.  It sure wouldn't be pretty (although it probably wouldn't be TOTAL RECALL either.)  However, I soon forgot about this falsity as the plot progressed, and the characters met the living inhabitants of the planet--insect-like animals, creatively and believably constructed.  They looked real, and seemed to fit our description of the organisms that could possibly live on Mars.The presence of some true science in Red Planet at least excuses some of the film's fictional liberties--scientific facts aren't altogether blatantly disregarded and ignored here.  They are disguised and hidden when they interfere with the film's drama.  The film does, for example acknowledge the length of time the voyage to Mars would take, and (humorously) the effect of Mars' low gravity on human visitors (something that M2M again failed to do.)Red Planet is interesting and entertaining, even if it isn't the cosmic action film that some may have hoped for, or avoided because it apparently wasn't.  Hopefully it will get more attention on video and DVD.

Why does the only spaceship in space need anti-collision blinking red lights? (Star Trek(s), Lost in Space, etc.)  The spinning centrifuge supposedly creates the gravity, but we never see the curved floors as in 2001.  In fact we see flat floors as Terence Stamp pedagogues to Val Kilmer.  And when the gravity kicks on it does not come on slowly as the centrifuges begin to spin again, rather it comes on like a lightswitch.  If (instead) the gravity is magnetic, then why is glass held in place?Why do the flashbacks have to be scenes we already saw?

That's like leaving Spitting Cobras in a day care center. Lost in Space (TV and movie) used the robot turned against us device as was Hal in 2001.  The final showdown with AMEE was right out of Aliens with our hero whipping a coup de grace on the attacker.  But hey, learn from Terminator - how does a measly punch and fire destroy this battle-droid? At least Val Kilmer did not call AMEE bitch.  Then the remote sensor (see Empire Strikes Back, or the TV dud Viper) hits like a mortar round and Kilmer is unscathed.  Then he pulls out the battery that just happens to be the right voltage and amperage for an ancient Russian (Soviet?) craft that has full-color Misha the Bear indicators for low battery.  Yeah, sure, right.AMEE was (seriously now) very eerie and scary as she moved like a jungle cat but the squinting eye and kung-fu stance made her lose all credibility.Mars has ice.

This is one of those movies, one where there is a lot of promise... a lot of unrealized promise. If someone could have taken it and shaped it more carefully, I think it could have been a lot more interesting.If you've seen the trailers, this movie looks like We crash land on Mars, and then our robot doggie comes and kills us one by one. What it really is is Obstacles One Might Face When Journeying To Mars. The main characters just face one hurdle after another and keep going, and not one thing emerges as the biggest challenge. Thus, this movie has more of a road movie structure than suspense or action structure. Which is fine, you just have to get used to it. I personally found it enjoyable, in not terribly exciting. You could do a lot worse.THERE ARE SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT>>>>>There were some opportunities that I thought were really wasted, the biggest being Carrie AM's shooting out into space at the end. She is cooped up in the constricting ship the whole time, while Val is on the ground, with the tension constricting around him also. When she shoots herself from the confined ship into space--with the accompanying choral music--it's exciting, but it more hints at how really enthralling it could have been had the entire movie been shaped better. This scene really could have been the orgasm of the film--where all the built up tension is suddenly and thrillingly released, with a symbolic rush into space--but it just wasn't handled carefully enough to come off as well as it should have. Maybe some other film will use this better.Carrie AM is very good in this. I would like to see her get more dramatic parts. She is strong without being a ball-buster, and projects intelligence. Val Kilmer is one of my favorite actors, not because he's always that good, but because whatever he does, he makes it INTERESTING. His performance here may seem flat, but I think he's just decided to play this character as a low-key guy-- he IS the space janitor, after all. I think the archetype of this movie is in boys' initiation rituals into manhood. Val is the least mature member of his crew--he's the janitor. He has a flirtation with the only female in the film, but cannot complete it. There is a father figure who offers spiritual guidance. Then he is exiled to a planet with no females, and his father figure is taken away. He must endure a number of trials; seeing his friends turn on each other, trying to survive, etc. He begins to absorb the spiritual lessons offerred by the father figure, and has to slay a monster (the robot) at the end, before he can return to the female, matured, and ready to complete his connection with her. So little really happens in this movie, and when it does, we're so distanced from it, that the sybolic elements really come to the forefront.

Red Planet is not the most spectacular science fiction movie I've ever seen, but it's a good one. American moviegoers should give this film a chance. It's opened in fifth place at the box office this weekend with a disappointing estimated gross of $9 million. Don't let this opening weekend gross make you think that this movie stinks. Go see it. I'm sure that after you see it, you'll agree with me that it's a much better movie than Mission to Mars. I know I did.

The characters are given little time to develop, the acting is dead (save for Tom Sizemore who hasn't been more likeable than in this movie), the special effects are HORRIBLE, the music is gut-wrenchingly-bad, and the whole movie leaves you thinking so what?

Here is how I sum it up Mission tried to be a realistic story but ended up with gobs of implausible events and actions to mess up the works. Red Planet tries only to be a 'classic' sci-fi film of the kind we don't see much of now-a-days. Except in its computer enhanced look, it harks back to those old black & white films of spacemen landing on the unknown planet, finding something unexpected, then having their numbers whittled down while they race to save the day using only their native resources. In the regard I thought Red Planet to be a pleasant surprise. SPOILER ALERT The quickie spoiler Earth has been sending probes to mars for years, trying to seed the planet with algae which will convert the atmosphere to one with more suitable chemistry for humans. The experiment seems to be working, but then the stuff mysteriously disappears, and a crew is hurriedly dispatched to investigate. Things go wrong, and the commander is left stranded in orbit on a disabled ship whilst the rest of the crew bail out to the surface, expecting to hole up in an existing habitat from a robot mission. Both parties (in orbit on on the surface) lose touch due to landing damage, a couple of crew die of injuries, the military robot (hastily brought along for its navigational capabilities) goes into it's 'kill everyone' mode, the habitat turns out to have been ravaged and devoid of foodstuffs, and the race begins. The commander (Carrie-Anne Moss, in her best Sigourney Weaver-in-Alien resourceful mode) battles against time to restore enough functionality to the ship for a return trip home, thinking that the guys below are dead. The guys meanwhile think she's dead, and that their time is numbered (remember the robot stalking them one by one?). As their number dwindle, the hero (Val Kilmer, depressed by the loss of his buddies and by the supposed loss of his secret beloved in orbit above) outwits the robot, finds an early NASA probe and salvages its radio to re-establish contact with the commander above, then hightails it to find a larger Russian probe, abandoned but capable in theory of giving him a lift back into orbit for a ride home if the boss can manage to fix the ship. In the process, of course, he discovers the secret of the missing alage and the barren habitat, both of which will save the day for Earth if he can just get off the planet alive!The film's basic plausibility is decent, at least within the standards of this kind of science fiction. Most things are suitably likely given the genre. There are a few things that really stretch credibility (why would they have every put THAT on the ship unless they knew this unlikely scenario was going to happen?), but still the crap-o-counter was reading lower than with Mission to Mars.The film's script has been called bland, wooden or just plain boring. I thought that there is nothing wrong with people talking to themselves when they are basically alone, and astronaut types are not required to spew witty lines when in a crisis situation. The dialogue served its purpose, but was not the main point of the film.There are some cool things. The landing of the pod with its air cushion balloons, everything about the military robot, the finding and use of the NASA probe, the cute yet somehow foreign user interface on the Russian probe, and of course the answer to the algae question.I give it three out of four stars.

Don't stop reading there just because I said that... 'Armageddon' was one of the worst, most shallow films I've ever seen, but it was entertaining as hell. Same goes for 'Red Planet', though it at least did have something below the flashy exterior, unlike 'Armageddon' and pretty much every space movie since 'Capricorn One', especially the disappointing 'Mission to Mars'. That something was an urge to become a better film, to break away from the over used scenes and space cliches. All the elements were in place, great direction, a capable cast, good dialogue, lots of action, only it's too much like the other recent space films.The plot is more plausible than most space flicks, a bleak vision of the future, where humans have depleted all of the Earth's resources and must find a new planet to colonize in order to survive as a race. The planet they decide upon is our neighbour, the 'Red Planet'- Mars. Since the early 2000s, they have been sending probes to Mars filled with algae to promote growth and allow the atmosphere to become more Earth like. Everything seems to be going well until the year 2050 when all of the algae begins disappearing and the oxygen levels drop without any explanation. NASA (presumably, even though it's only referred to as 'Houston'), has planned the first manned mission to Mars, consisting of six people, to find a possible cause for the recent problems on the planet. Once they land, the pieces slowly fall into place, revealing nothing less than sheer terror.The casting was very good, getting the perfect combination of talent (Terence Stamp, Carrie-Anne Moss) and star power (Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore). The inspired direction by newcomer Antony Hoffman also helped rise it above the norm, same goes for the exceptional sound design. To really appreciate the sound in this movie, you have to see it in theaters, and if it doesn't at least get an Academy Award nomination in that field, I'm sure a lot of people, including myself, will be disappointed.If nothing else, 'Red Planet' is a whole lot of fun, with good special effects and some funny one liners from Kilmer and Moss. A good film for a Saturday afternoon matinee, and if you miss it in theaters, then you're not missing all that much. A treat for your senses, but not your mind.6.5/10 "},{"Title":"Considerably better than Mission to Mars, but still lacking something...","Date":"10 November 2000","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  Well, seeing that I had to wait 7 months for the other Mars movie came out (aka Red Planet), I was anticipating that tonight would prove that this movie *was* how it was anticipated to be better than Mission to Mars.  And it was.I saw this movie with my dad, who is not an easy moviegoer...any movie without war or extensive action is not good enough, but I was really into it.  The special effects were very well-done and quite imaginative, especially the maps and the action sequences.  Looking into the future has never been so well-developed than this movie, in my opinion...very imaginative.  The cinematography was pretty good...it creates a pretty unsettling environment for the viewer, which is probably what the director intended it to be, which is a harsh environment for these characters.  Speaking of characters, Carrie-Anne Moss, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, and company give pretty good performances, but they did the best with what they were given, and that is the second part of my review.There are some parts of the movie that don't have the best writing and dialogue that could have been delivered.  Like said, the actors used what they got to their best.  Some of the character development was not as extensive as one would want it to be...never got to really get into a character's shoes.  Especially Kilmer's role.  I've never seen him in action as the space janitor, but I know he has that occupation by what the characters say.  Also, getting back to action, I will admit that this movie does lack in action sequences.  Nonetheless, this is made up by the special effects and the climax of the film.Bottom line  Good movie, great effects, exceptionally well-done by the actors, but don't expect too many action sequences and deep character development.  Recommended to sci-fi fans and people who despised of the earlier Mars movie.  8/10P.S. Try not to sit in front of an annoying teenage group and behind a coughing old lady!

The storyline in Red Planet is just simply too far fetched to be anywhere near the other movie.The story in Red Planet is about an expedition sent to Mars to try to figure out a way to save the dying Earth. But the mission quickly goes awry and it becomes a desperate race against time.Storywise, then Red Planet wasn't as captivating or thrilling as Mission to Mars was. Sure, it had its moments, but in overall it didn't fare all that well.There weren't all that many special effects throughout the movie, which sort of was a shame, because it could have brightened up the movie, now that it was failing on its storyline. However, one of the special effects that should be mentioned as being fantastic was the fire in zero gravity. That was really impressive, and the movie is worth watching for that scene alone.As for the acting, well I can't claim to be a fan of neither Val Kilmer or Carrie-Anne Moss, but they were actually doing quite good jobs in Red Planet. It was a shame that Simon Baker wasn't given a more outstanding character or a character with more impact on the story, because his talent was far from utilized in this movie. And the choice of Tom Sizemore, well that just baffles me - enough said.What didn't work for me in Red Planet was the fact that there was breathable air on the surface of Mars. And if these algae and insects were creating breathable air, wouldn't it require a much, much larger area of algae covered ground? And as such, wouldn't that green patch be noticeable on the surface of Mars from space? The costumes were quite interesting, as was the interior of the spacecraft. Although it was a bit too futuristic compared to its functionality. But hey, it looked cool.Mars itself wasn't really convincing, especially because (as I just mentioned) that there was breathable air there. And, similar to Mission to Mars they had failed to take into consideration the gravity issues, that it differs from Earth. And also during the ice storm, wouldn't you be able to see people's breath clearly as they exhale? Visuals are important when making a movie such as this.I am rating Red Planet 4 out of 10 stars, because it failed in overall to pass as a Sci-Fi movie with potential. It was just some nice landscape shots with a mediocre story that had rather large holes in the story. Not the brightest moment in Sci-Fi cinema.

This a good movie, if you are 12 yrs old. Though even a well educated 12 yr old today will be able to shoot holes in it. The movie is so full of clichés it is like one of the sci fi films I saw back in the 50s. I watched it as I like C A Moss and also Kilmer. First the old guy scientist turned philosopher (why is he (Stamp) there, maybe to lend some gravitas?) is left to die 'philosophically' after a catastrophic landing including falling down the equivalent of the Grand Canyon, which BTW would have killed everybody due to the G forces involved, who needs an old guy anyway? Then another one, I forget who, is pushed or falls off a cliff by the bad guy. Then bad guy is eaten by beetles, where did they come from? There was also no food before the algae grew. Then Sizemore commits suicide because the beetles are eating him. Leaving of course the handsome hero who has the romance going with Moss to escape, on an ancient Russian probe, without oxygen. He survives zero oxygen space for a ridiculously long time, how? BTW astronauts usually have instruments which can tell them the O2 levels without having to take their helmets off!! Plus we can detect atmospheric gases from space probes on any planet. Then there is the 'science'. The highly advanced space ship cannot survive a solar flare, without blowing out all its instruments. They, NASA would not see that coming! Then it catches fire everywhere after the rest of the crew has left and Moss successfully puts out the fire single handedly, and the ship still functions perfectly! After she lets all the atmosphere out of the ship there is still O2 enough for the return trip to Earth, that's odd oxygen usually explodes in fires. Then the enormous habitat is found to be totally destroyed along with its oxygen and food, though oddly its fuel is still there so they can make a bonfire of it. Not surprising as it seemed to be made of aluminium foil. But how did it get there in the first place and why did they not notice it was destroyed on their approach to Mars? We can read number plates from satellites remember, and Moss sees the fire started by Sizemore from orbit. As for the robot which has military capability, what happened to 'we come in peace' and Asimov's rules about robotics? What is it supposed to fight on Mars and how is the invincible and amazingly agile robot so easily overcome by Kilmer so he can steal its battery to power some antiquated Russian technology. I could go on but why bother. With today's knowledge about space technology there is no excuse for making such an old fashioned movie in 2000.

Maybe that's why it's set 50 years ahead, making up for the unlikely scenario. And lo and behold; the woman undermines her leadership authority by engaging in a romance with a crew member. Not too credible, or is it? You decide! That aside, there are several other issues that in itself undermines the movie's authority 1) The spaceship needs to be 'parked' manually between two moons as the female commander proudly accomplish. Of course the entire trip would be automated and run from Houston. No room for a quick human error here.2) It is not likely that such a mission is endeavoured based on a hit an run chance of avoiding a solar storm as occurs and which disables the proud ship. Either adequate protection would be enforced and/or the 'space weather' would be taken into account in the last hours by space 'meteorologists', 'parking' the ship on the backside of Mars in case of any outlook to a solar storm, which can already be predicted based on sun spot activity.3) Given the oxygen level, even though the men could endure the max temperature 20° C (68° F), it's unlikely the could survive the night with the helmet off (for breathing after the stored O2 ran out) as the temperature drops to a minimum of -140° C (-220° F).4) The silliness of the robot-going-killer Amee, a highly advanced machine manufactured to withstand combat situations yet malfunctions after the ballooned landing, subtracts further from the credibility of the movie. I kind of guess it's metal would brittle at the nightly temperatures, but allow for technological advances. Then again it's unlikely it would fail after a planned landing using balloons with some foreseen bumps.5) I also didn't like the very foggy, unprecise and extremely belated report of 'life on Mars' which the sole surviving 'guy' accidentally reports in a side comment at the final rescue. Any astronaut would surely alarm the spaceship immediately of the sensation but waits until the final minutes. Besides, he vaguely reports 'it eats through everything' - given they want to move inside the spaceship, partly made of the same material as the eaten spacesuit was made of, I wonder how they would keep the bugs from eating the spaceship and the cannister it's been captured in? 6) The probability of the 'guys' being caught in the only ice storm on the planet is? 1 to some millions? 7) Given the alleged ice storm to under -50 C, I wonder how both bugs and algae survives? Lava I could understand, but bugs and algae? 8) Out of nowhere on the surface of Mars, the 'guys' can suddenly solder to produce the radio? Solding tools from where? and the power source?9) Even more surprising is the roll of tape the 'guys' produce to support the astronaut with the broken rib.The list of improbabilities goes on and on.Credits earned for great landscaping and good visual effects and the design of the spaceship.Summing up I would say a good effort by many was wasted on a weak script and a leading female with no screen authority to support her role.

Bowman's crew consists of Robby Gallagher (Val Kilmer) who is a mechanical systems engineer, a co-pilot Lieutenant Ted Santen (Benjamin Bratt) & Dr. Bud Chantilas (Terence Stamp) who is the chief science officer. Joining them are two civilians, Dr. Quinn Burchenal (Tom Sizemore) who is one of the worlds leading bio-engineers & Chip Pettengill (Simon Baker) who happens to be a terraform expert. They are also taking along a military robot named AMEE which stands for Autonomous Mapping Exploration & Evasion. After travelling through space for 182 days the Mars-1 reaches it's destination, Mars. Unfortunately radiation caused by a solar flare badly damages the Mars-1, the crew have just 6 minutes before all primary systems shut down. The crew manage to put their spacesuits on & make it to a small escape pod, except Bowman who has to stay behind & manually launch the pod because there isn't enough power to launch it automatically. After the escape pod is safely launched Bowman manages to repair the Mars-1 all by herself by messing about with a few wires, clever girl. The escape pod lands on the surface of Mars & promptly falls over the edge of a cliff, once the pod completely stops it becomes clear that Chantilas is badly hurt & will not be able to travel any further. The remaining men only have seven and a half hours of oxygen left in their tanks, the algae that should be present isn't. Adding to their problems AMEE has been damaged during the crash landing & gone nuts, reverting back to her military mode. Things look bad for the mission as AMEE isn't programmed to take prisoners, the men have no food, water or means of contacting anyone & are running low on air... Directed by Antony Hoffman I thought Red Planet was an OK time waster but nothing that really sticks in the memory. The script by Chuck Pfarrer & Jonathan Lemkin moves along at a reasonable pace & isn't boring, but it does contain situations which just didn't sit well with me at all. What's all this solar flare causing damage to the Mars-1? We have spacecraft now which can withstand this sort of occurrence. And what about this breathable air nonsense? If they can detect that the oxygen levels are falling then why can't they detect that it's also breathable? We could do that now as well. Who built that run down complex they come across? It states that they're the first manned mission to Mars & that they had previously only sent unmanned probes. Maybe I missed something along the way. When Burchenal cause the massive fire that kills himself & the alien bugs & Bowman can clearly see from space why is Gallagher completely unaffected even though he was standing mere feet away from him? Surely he would have been caught in the explosion as well. Why take a military robot along with you? Why not a moon buggy that you could drive or something like that? How did Bowman manage to repair the Mars-1 so easily on her own? I also thought Red Planet was a bit patchy in places, AMEE is only in it sporadically which is bad because she's just about the best part of Red Planet & the characters aren't developed that much. Having said that if you ignore some of the silliness & stupidity Red Planet is quite entertaining to watch, but at almost 2 hours long it probably could have done with being a little shorter though. The special effects are generally excellent, I especially liked the ultra modern cool looking AMEE. It's well made throughout with nice production design & sets, the acting is OK but nothing spectacular. Overall I was entertained & there isn't anything really wrong with it when you consider it's just a big budget Sci-Fi action film, there are much worse out there. Worth watching but just don't expect anything particularly deep or meaningful, decent enough.

In both cases there is a solid budget, a number of relatively big name actors (though not really good actors, apart from Sinise in Mission to Mars I guess). And in both cases there is failure.In Mission to Mars things would be OK, were it not for the pathetic departure scene where no one seems to believe in the scene and actually look like they're going to start laughing any moment now. And for the pathetic gene-decoding sequence where we're told that a chromosome is missing at the end of the ADN chain (when a chromosome is MADE of ADN...). And actually the closing sequence with the Martian is quite moving, very De Palma-esque. But overall the impression is that a good deal more editing was needed, which is why the film got about a 5 average (vs. a potential 8-9 had it been properly edited)In Red Planet the ambitions are clearly more modest, more down to earth (no pun intended). And so in Red Planet I guess we are not disappointed in that there is no moment in the film where we are allowed to think that maybe things will improve from here. So the film gets a 5 (and never looks like it could have had more than 5).But because Red Planet does not even try to be intelligent or sensitive or noble ar anything, I guess this makes it the worse film of the two.Both can be avoided.

Hoping to start afresh on a new planet, humans begin seeding Mars with atmosphere-producing algae. Overseeing such operations is Kate Bowman (Carrie-Anne Moss), commander of a spaceship sent to monitor oxygen production on Mars. To her surprise, life has begun evolving on the once barren planet.There have been a number of science-fiction films set after an ecological collapse (Silent Running, Wall-E, Lost in Space, Interstellar, Mad Max, No Blade of Grass, Pandorum, Snowpiecer, The Colony etc). Like most of these films, though, Red Planet simply uses its premise to string together a collection of formulaic action sequences. We thus watch as crewmen go violently insane, are attacked by CGI creatures and robots, sacrificially die to save others and as various emergencies befall a spaceship. With a nod to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, the film also attempts to get philosophical, several characters tangentially discussing atheism and creationism. These conversations are trite and terribly written. By its climax, only actress Carrie-Anne Moss, whose character's name is itself a nod to Kubrick, has escaped with dignity. Beautifully sculpted by Darwin's hand, she's a more interesting piece of evolutionary synthesis than anything else in Hoffman's film. Val Kilmer co-stars.5/10 &#x96; Worth one viewing.

The story is as silly now as it was then, the science and technology as ludicrous (a robot with ninja moves!), the performances as theatrical. But what really has sunk it, I think, is the handling of cinematic space.Films set in space only bring to the fore, with more clarity than usual films, cinematic space as the main anchor of a story-world. 2001 got right a set of notions about the gravity of things in space, the viewing gravity that creates immersion, so every extravagant thing down the road was rooted in our first having been transported to space. I'm eagerly anticipating Gravity as the new template in this field.Here everything feels phony.An unfortunate contrast with the closing theme, so to speak, which is how god, what we call god, is the willingness to not give up, on close ones and otherwise, and this willingness is nothing else than not losing track/sight of the presence of another human being in space, a matter of persisting vision.

That can only come about via massive quantities of water and  A type of algae that gives out oxygen wouldn't be enough to bring about an atmosphere and at no point in the movie are we shown any oceans That's the main problem with RED PLANET , we're treated to plot twists that aren't explained . The survivors of a space fall soon find their oxygen supplies running out and one of them decides to end his suffering by opening his helmet only to find that the planet does have an atmosphere . Wouldn't equipment on the mother ship have noticed this long before then ? The mission commander also points out that there's an ice storm coming like it's a natural phenomena to Mars . Again ice storms would only happen if a planet has an atmosphere something the commander takes in her stride , and despite everything no one ever realises that Mars is a low gravity planet I guess I'm being pedantic because in some places RED PLANET is scientifically correct and this causes the audience to notice when the movie decides to ignore facts when the story suits it . It's not a terrible movie and comes across a bit like SATURN 3 meets SCOTT OF THE ANTARTIC with high production values but it's not the greatest movie you'll see this week "},{"Title":"Is this worse than Mission to Mars?","Date":"26 December 2001","Score":"8 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":"  I've had a real dilemma since seeing Red Planet.  For this year, which was the worse movie, Red Planet or Mission to Mars?  It's a tough call.  I gave both a 2, feeling the sometimes fun special effects saved each from being Plan 9 level.  But, these are both truly awful science-fiction films. What is so amazing is how both turned out to be just about the same film. Both are based on the big accident when we get there plot line. At least Red Planet avoided the Faces on Mars nonsense of Mission to Mars.  But, the idea that we can have massive terraforming efforts going on on Mars including a built habitat without noticing lots of life forms, dramatically increased oxygen levels, and everything else this movie just pops out of the woodwork is so moronic as to be just about Plan 9 level.  As if that wasn't enough, we throw in the killer robot/military hardware run amok standard plot line #17 just for good measure.I have long wondered at the workings of Hollywood.

Long dialogue scenes are less than convincing, and I'm not sure what space program would put these mostly neurotic misfits on such a crucial, Earth-saving mission (though much the same could be said of THE MATRIX's characters).  But all that is secondary to the over-arching vision.RED PLANET is a story of initial planetary pioneering, much in the tradition of DIE FRAU IM MOND (1929), DESTINATION MOON (1950), and ROBINSON CRUSOE ON MARS, the wonderful 1964 B-film that is the movie's clearest predecessor. Unlike the far-future, faster-than-light space operas that are likely more fantasy than science, all of these films deal with with the more realistic perils of space travel -- 1) there is no air; 2) people under pressure in tight confinement get on each others' nerves; 3) things (mostly bad) happen; and 4) there's no 911 in space.Mars has perhaps evinced the greatest sense of wonder of any heavenly body over the centuries.  RED PLANET pays tribute to that wonder in a throwback to early science fiction as the planet looms like a bloody blot in the sky and then becomes a jagged, rusty wasteland, threatening at every turn, with superb cinematography by Peter Suschitzky.While maintaining a relatively simple storyline, the movie has truly creative variations on the science fiction canon.  **Possible Spoiler Alert** In what film have you seen a spectacular zero-g fire?  Or the the unique solution of air bags to land a capsule?  Or a robot malfunction that is threatening more because of the crew's desperate circumstances than anything else?  Or the Macgyver-like use of previous space missions?  Or a truly creative concept of life on Mars -- a far shot from the little green men of WAR OF THE WORLDS or the execrable MISSION TO MARS.  There also many plot twists which keep the film fresh and interesting, with even a new turn on the traditional love story.Carrie-Ann Moss puts in a superb performance as the flight's, no-nonsense commander, evincing a character much softer than Ripley from the ALIEN saga. Tom Sizemore and Terence Stamp are excellent, as usual.  Val Kilmer is less smarmy than usual.Overall, RED PLANET's greatest accomplishment is putting the sense of wonder back into the most ordinary space travel.  And that is a WONDERFUL thing.

The movie just could never grab my interest and basically I couldn't care less for any of the characters, despite the fact that they are all being played by some great and well known actors, such as Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss, Benjamin Bratt and Terence Stamp.The story also isn't really a credible or realistic one. The whole AMEE thing...please give me a break! The movie could had definitely worked out with a better and more clever thought out concept. For a science-fiction movie the story is simply lacking in its fundamental things. It instead uses the more standard clichés you could expect from a movie like this. There basically is very little original about Red Planet, when you're already familiar with the genre.The movie is basically about a ground crew on Mars, all dying one by one in some very stupid and also predictable ways. This is basically the only excitement the movie has to offer. Some of the most interesting characters die to soon, while the least interesting live on for too long.For most the special effects are good, though they are certainly lacking in certain sequences. Nevertheless for 2000 standards it's still acceptable. Mars itself is obviously looking as if it was shot on location somewhere in the dessert, which it was. Most sequences were shot in Jordan and Australia but who knows, maybe it really looks like Mars, I am no expert on that subject.Basically I'm not surprised director Antony Hoffman never directed a movie after this one again. It's way too standard and not surprising or exciting. In his defense, it was also the first movie he ever directed by the way. Red Planet became a big box office bomb, grossing only about $15.000.000, while costing more than 4 times as much to make.Just like the other 2000 'Mars' movie. Mission to Mars, this is not really a movie worth seeing. At least Mission to Mars still had some memorable moments thanks to the Brian De Palma directing. This movie on the other hand is very forgettable and lacking in too much.4/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Rewrite and Carrie Take More Clothes Off","Date":"19 June 2015","Score":"30 out of 62 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" Spoilers AheadWhy do you think she spends the last half of the movie running around in a wet nighty?

When Kilmer is biting it, and he is signing off she sounds like her misandrist daily magazine just went bi weekly. Please, who was the casting wizard who made her lead actor in the movie. Put Kilmer in front, idiots, even Sizemore towers over this Matrix midget. If you are looking for the number one reason the movie went down the crapper take a good look; Carrie Anne never was lead actor of another movie ever again. We saw this replicated with SALT another box office disaster; sorry, the misandrist demographic just not big enough to sustain 90 pound, muscle challenged, bad acting leads. The script is just awful; it was the second reason it bombed. Let's have them walk across the entire surface of Mars for the whole movie chased by the most boring, non scary robot. Sizemore and Kilmer do competent jobs, as I said if you had made one of them the lead, instead of the undeserving Moss, who had made far less movies, the film might have done much better. This boredom is not lightened by singing a crappy Stones song, or showing us urinating in lower gravity. Thanks, that is too much information. The drama, in the ship, with the fire does not work because Moss cannot convey fear or any other emotion; she is total insouciant boredom. We stop caring soon after the movie starts. Everyone wonders about Stamp's character, they know they are in trouble; hence, let's make him a philosopher to add some metaphysics to this pile of crap. It does not work. The film fails because of the painful synthesis between a boring, slow narrative on Mars blended with Deer in the Headlight's woman up in the ship. Her acting has to be seen to be believed. The ending, where his brain is without air for say ten minutes before revival, did not help things. Hey, maybe he wrote the script? There was good chemistry between Kilmer and Sizemore which makes us wonder if we had a better actor as Captain, one who could act, what the movie might have been. Like Salt, the PC agenda, you know we must all have our little red books, just obliterates the movie; oh well, just so the right action groups are appeased. This is why American cinema is so terrible. All the ways reality must be bent to make sure our butts are not swinging out there in the wind. The movie puts the B in boring. Yes, her body is hot but she was a dreadful, untalented actress and she had no business being in that role. I was glad the film bombed; I suspect the other actors behind her that deserved that role, secretly, shared my enthusiasm.

The biggest point of annoyance appears soon after the commandant of the first manned mission to Mars is a woman. A photo-model type female, in fact, in charge of five men. Sure, why not. The left wing Hollywood's PC-ists are tireless; after trying to convince us through numerous movies and TV shows that nearly all of the best judges are black women, it was time to convince us that the space exploration of the future will be dominated by (white) women. And roads will be built by three-legged apples. The second in command is a Latino, played by Bratt. Hell, so where are the Asians and the Eskimos in this little band of astronauts?? Why did they forget to include an astronaut who is Nepalese? The American Nepalese community will be appalled, and rightly so. In a way I am glad that a movie with such a dumb set-up turned out to be as dumb as it did.This film has it all astronauts acting like teenagers and rock-stars, astronauts who hug their bible before and after taking a leak, astronauts engaging in bargain-basement philosophy, a lousy undramatic soundtrack, plot-twists and plot-devices seen and heard a million times before, and dialog right out of Hollywood's school of 90s blockbuster school of writing. Out of all the dumb things, the robot Amee really takes the cake; we have here a mission to Mars which is purely scientific, yet they bring along a robot which is skilled in killing more people than Rambo could ever dream of. Just because posers Kilmer & co. decided to switch it off (or as Kilmer puts it, kill it) the robot suddenly turns against its masters with an instantaneousness and eagerness unrivaled in all of film's evil rebel-robot world. Usually a robot serves a useful purpose before it turns nasty - but not this one; Amee's only use is as that of a bad plot-device. One would think - logically - that if the mission includes a black-belt robot then at least the crew would have guns or something. Wrong. No guns. No intelligent falls of a cliff, either. Bratt gets pushed off a cliff for the stupidest reason imaginable. In this movie even a fire isn't logical when Sizemore commits suicide he creates a huge fire-like explosion which could be seen from the planet's orbit - but guess what Kilmer is unscathed, in spite of standing only meters away from Sizemore!

In March 2000, Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins, under director Brian de Palma, went to Mars ignorantly. In November of that same year, Hollywood synergy (read as plagiarism) sends Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss and director Antony Hoffman to the same planet just as ignorantly.In 2050, Earth is such a wasted tramp of a planet that humankind is considering Mars as its next rape. A scout ship is sent to the red planet &#150; but here's the twist instead of sending well-trained, staid scientists and astronauts, they sent a bunch of actors. Trying to pass as scientists seeking answers to overpopulation, their uninformed arguments, insufferable stupidity and specious philosophies tell us they're really seeking Golden Globe nominations.Val Kilmer is the maintenance jockey (the least scientist-y of the ersatz scientists), Carrie-Ann Moss is the ship commander, (breasts a-strainin' against her sweaty commander t-shirt), Benjamin Bratt the womanizer, Simon Baker the Weird Guy, Tom Sizemore is Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman and Terence Stamp is a pontificating pain in the arse.Stamp pompously opines, I realized Science couldn't answer any of the really interesting questions. One wonders which science he studied, as ALL science answers exactly that. Either this failed Nietzsche has no clue on Scientific Method or he never asked any really interesting questions&#133; or he was always just a religious nutjob who was trying to find the Scientology mothership out here.Smart-mouthing their way to Mars like glibness is fueling their ship, one of them says, The hope and survival of mankind rests on us. Gee, I hope not.*Red Planet*'s serviceable plot involves stranded humans trying to think their way out of a situation that keeps throwing up obstacles &#150; in this case, men landing on Mars with their escape craft damaged and air running out. It could have been a very interesting crisis had the SCIENCE actually been in this FICTION. Instead, like Chantilas not asking the interesting questions, this movie studiously avoids the interesting science, writers Chuck Pfarrer and Jonathan Lemkin creating a Science FANTASY that makes up rules as it goes along; the worst offender being Tom Sizemore ludicrously rationalizing how there could be breathable air on Mars, to explain the rank stupidity of everyone taking their helmets off so that we could see their pretty actor faces. ... From there, it is a low grav downhill ride.Who are the science consultants on these movies? Is anyone being consulted at all? One astronaut pushes another off a cliff, yet though they all have their helmet radios on, the pushed guy never thinks to scream into his radio, Hey, this asshole pushed me off a cliff! When Moss is giving Kilmer CPR in zero-gravity, the computer instructs, Stand him up, Commander &#150; but how will that help in zero-gee? As in every movie that presents a moral dilemma (here, only one person can survive, the others have to sacrifice themselves) it ends up being not so much a dilemma as the story neatly excises the good guys who would have had to battle amongst themselves for the ride home (so there is never any REAL sacrifice).The stakes are ramped up for no reason at all when Kilmer's panther-like robot, AMEE, goes into KILL mode, enabling the killer who pushed the guy off a cliff to get his just desserts; other good guys die so that they won't have to draw straws; and Val Kilmer &#150; as was pre-ordained by Romantic Ending Protocol &#150; spends a languorous six month ride back to Earth humping the commander.

It's interesting that Carrie-Ann Moss was in this film.  She hardly does anything, and her lack of humor is never really explained(I don't know how I could've missed an explanation, but I did).  Also, she was in The Matrix, another effects and sound bonanza.  However, The Matrix had developed characters, and it had a plot, which is what made it work.I wouldn't call Red Planet a terrible film.  It's technically superb, and they did try to make a good film.  And even if nothing happens in a film, that doesn't bother me.  The problem was they forgot a plot and didn't know how to develop the characters.  Without those essential elements in a film, it can make a film with a promise a long, boring failure.

This is a shame, as SF literature about Mars is so rich and varied, you wish someone would adapt a classic novel, instead of 'creating' such derivative nonsense!Earth of 2025 is on the brink of ecological suicide; in an effort to provide a new home for humans, unmanned spaceships have begun terraforming Mars, sending oxygen-producing algae, as well as creating a habitat for a manned mission. Finally, a massive space-constructed craft is dispatched to complete the work. The crew consists of efficient and beautiful commander Carrie-Anne Moss; hunky but arrogant pilot Benjamin Bratt; sensitive, philosophizing doctor Terence Stamp; opportunistic, wise-cracking bio-engineer Tom Sizemore; over-sensitive dweeb technician Simon Baker, and sweet nonconformist 'mechanic' Val Kilmer. Rounding out the crew is a robot loaned by the Marines, nicknamed AMEE, which looks like a rejected 'attack-bot' design from 'Robocop', to perform surface experiments. If these characters all sound like stereotypes...they are!When a solar flare seriously damages the spacecraft, in low-Mars orbit, Moss is forced to send the crew down to the surface, while she attempts to save the mothership. Then the problems REALLY begin!Without giving away any of the spoilers, let me just say that you'll see plot elements lifted from 'Event Horizon', '2001', 'Outland', 'Terminator', 'Pitch Black', and many other SF films. The sad thing is, 'Red Planet' doesn't improve on these elements, it simply rehashs them! Even the planet's surface recreates the 'Death Valley with a red filter' look of 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars', (it was the one element in 'Mission to Mars' that impressed me; Mars LOOKED unearthly!).I hate knocking this film; I'm a big Val Kilmer fan, and really had high hopes that this would be a big hit for him.

Red Planet wasn't quite as bad as I feared, but it was pretty close.Red Planet is basically a big-budget disaster flick, with a bit of slasher flick thrown in.  While it was certainly more exciting than Mission to Mars, it did suffer in comparison when it came to motivation and explanation. While Mission to Mars went into tedious detail trying to explain away all its unlikely plot elements, Red Planet doesn't even try.  It serves up plot contrivance after plot contrivance, without attempting to explain why things happened, or making any effort to make those things believable.  I can't go into too much detail, since that would give away too much detail of the plot of the film.  Suffice it to say, for virtually every time you find yourself thinking How or why did that happen?, just keep on wondering, because you sure won't get any answers from this flick.If you're the type of person who can enjoy a movie where things simply happen (and can keep a straight face when a killer robot exhibits a flair for the martial arts), you might enjoy Red Planet.

This film was in competition with Mission to Mars to be out first in 2000, but lost.  As it is, Red Planet is in many ways even worse than M2M, which was a space dog itself.  The story of Red Planet is as thin as the Martian atmosphere, and the characters have as much depth as an overnight frosting of carbon dioxide.  My 'implausibility meter' was almost always in the red -- in keeping with the film's title and with the tint of the surface imagery.  Some of the visuals were pretty, though, and sometimes I wanted to overlay their soundtracks with a good piece of music by Steve Reich or Brian Eno. Overall I got the impression that the film was most probably conceived as a commercial vehicle for Carrie-Anne Moss, who made a strong presence in The Matrix.  If I'm right, her strengths were effectively diluted in this film. There is virtually no authentic science expressed in Red Planet.  Imagine science as just one of the khaki colors of a mercenary incursion on the movie-going public.  The known facts of Mars, space, and space travel are treated mostly as inconvenient details that are glibly ignored or warped.  Like in the odious but sometimes hilarious film Battlefield Earth, we are expected to believe that fragile decades-old equipment left on the surface of Mars (i.e., the American Sojourner rover, and a fictional Russian sample-return spacecraft) can be jury-rigged for a surprise victory over adverse circumstances. Yeah, right. The chief science officer (Terence Stamp) was, at the very beginning of the film, characterised as the soul of the mission.  (Hello?  What does this mean?)  As an atheist I was a bit intrigued.  But it turned out that this meant that the science officer had left science for philosophy in his search for God.  He is also the first crewmember to die -- apparently because of a scriptwriter's vain attempt to lend some poignancy to a vacuous plot. Except for one mildly interesting positive comment by an improbably cast 'gene-coder' (Tom Sizemore), science was otherwise demoted several times in mock-serious asides that made the scientific method seem to be inadequate as an approach to illuminating the details of the universe, let alone its essential nature.  I guess the message is that only conservative Republicans and Democratic Vice-Presidential candidates can be effective space explorers...  But, most probably, the story was designed simply to be accommodating to the religious right and to the scientific illiteracy of most people.  The chill of space is warm in comparison.

The escape aboard the Russian rock carrier was the only really funny part of the movie.  It takes an incredible amount of work to get a ship to have enough power to get into orbit w/o killing everyone aboard. (1960 rockets killed the test animals inside.).  So here we've got this old clunker that allows humans to withstand orbit velocity!   The air available in the spacesuits is also funny.  Early in the movie Gallagher has no air left.  All gone.  By the end of the movie he has enough to fly off into space.  The trapeze 'rescue' by Bowman at the end also makes a mockery of the laws of physics.PLEASE save time and money and take a nap instead.

But it was SO bad that I just gave Red Planet my first 1 rating on IMDb.  That by itself led me to write this.  I wasn't expecting much at all - and I was STILL disappointed.  I thought that a sci-fi film with Val Kilmer and Carrie-Anne Moss couldn't be all bad, despite what I'd heard.  Ha!  It insults the viewer.  I try not to nit-pick movies, but when the errors JUMP out at you for the entire movie, it's unforgivable.  Even Mission to Mars was better.Some of the visual effects were adequate, but overall this movie fails miserably. The premise was weak, the plot was cliched, the script was dull, the acting was poor, and the physics/science was WAY off throughout.  About the best part of the movie was the gratuitous Carrie-Anne Moss shower scene. But it's really not worth watching just for that.I disliked this film from the start.  A decent movie at least needs a good premise.  I stopped the tape 5 times in the first 5 minutes so I could rail against the totally lame, error-filled, and illogical premise of Red Planet.Supposedly, by the year 2000, humanity is starting to realize we've so polluted the Earth that the only alternative for humanity is simply to find a new home.  So we began a 20-year program of algae seeding on Mars, to create a breathable atmosphere.  But something goes wrong, and the algae are suddenly dying.  Our heroes will have to go to Mars to figure out why, and save humanity.  It's only sci-fi, and they need some reason to go to Mars, but this premise bites.  The dates/years don't add up, and there are several other obvious holes and lame assumptions too.  Any moron should realize that it would be a million times harder to terraform and colonize an entire plant (in the very near future no less) than it would be to just fix the environmental problems we've created here on Earth.I thought the movie might still be worth watching, despite the weak start. Nope.  They just threw in every cliche and hackneyed plot device they could dredge up from other movies, and tried to make it work.  But they didn't put enough passion, effort, or plot twists into any of it, and an awful mess was the result.  There was NO suspense; NO surprises.  I knew what would happen in almost every scene.  I never cared enough about the characters to even really sympathize much with their predicament either.********  SPOILERS   ********OF COURSE, as the mission nears Mars, a huge solar flare virtually cripples their ship, to the point the crew must abandon it.  One person (Moss) must stay behind and manually initiate the escape sequence for the others.  They have to jettison their invaluable navigation robot on the way down, but it only gets slightly damaged on impact. By the way, it just happens to look like a giant feline terminator, has a combat mode that it gets locked into when the crew, to their detriment, tries to deactivate it later.OF COURSE, the lander module crash-lands, but the crew somehow survives, and manages to crash very near the (previously constructed) Mars habitat, which contains food and oxygen.  But when the crew reaches the habitat, it's been destroyed.  In orbit, Carrie-Anne manages to repair the ship enough to return to Earth.  She assumes the crew is dead.  But they manage to make contact JUST IN TIME, via a 50-year-old modem no less, that was conveniently located nearby in some old abandoned equipment.  Right!  (Similar to the improbable upload of the virus into the alien computer system in Independence Day.)OF COURSE, they discover, as they are running out of air, that they can somehow breathe fine on good ol' Mars after all.  LOL.  But it doesn't really matter, because they have no way to get off the planet anyway. EXCEPT for the old Russian probe that failed to return to Earth 50 years before.  It just HAPPENS to be nearby too.  Wow, it's a small world after all!  But there won't be room in it for everyone, so one person will have to stay behind.  But we know that their nav robot-turned-killer will make that problem moot, unless the nasty Mars bugs eat them first.  (Can anyone say, The Mummy?)  Turns out the bugs ate all of the algae from the terraforming project, and produce oxygen themselves, which is why the crew can breathe. That doesn't even come close to accounting for the temperature and pressure changes, etc., that would be necessary for humans to breathe unaided on Mars.  But Hollywood thinks we're all MORONS, right?OF COURSE, then Kilmer (sole survivor) can't get off Mars after all, because the Russian batteries have died.  In one of the few mildly interesting scenes, Moss talks to Kilmer when it seems he must surely be left to die. Can you say The Abyss? (Although far less moving.)  As Moss prepares to leave, Kilmer realizes he can use the robot's battery to power the probe's launch, if he can get its battery while it's trying to kill him.  He does just that, with NO problem, and launches the probe, into JUST the right orbit to rendezvous with the main ship, JUST in time!OF COURSE, Moss must go EVA and snag Kilmer with a tether, and once inside she must perform CPR to save him.  (The Abyss again!)  At least Val brought a couple of bugs with him, to take back to Earth to be analyzed.  Yippee, he's a hero!  OF COURSE, nothing is really answered - there are tons of loose ends.My description almost makes the movie sound like it could be mildly entertaining.  Sorry.  It isn't.  1/10.

A worse Mars movie than Mission To Mars!","Date":"27 January 2014","Score":"7 out of 31 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller","Review":" (No SERIOUS spoilers! Just playing safe!)From start to finish, this film is LAZY. Research is non-existent. Astronauts (and presumably scriptwriters) are too ignorant of past missions to know the name of Pathfinder! (That rover, what's its name is one reference.) The geneticist talks about writing code with A, G, T and P! (It is C not P.) How little effort would it take, to get such basics right?Why did non-fans of science try making a space movie?What an insult to the audience this travesty is.If you watch, enjoy your eye candy, the gleaming white futurism and the boobies. Stop with the dishonest reviews. Wanking to this film ISN'T anything to be ashamed of, but dishonestly praising the film for its artistic integrity IS!Even Mission To Mars had fewer errors, better dialogue, more point, and fewer people killed by bad science. I almost feel like watching it again, for a dose of sanity.Of course accurate science isn't everything in storytelling, but a bit of authenticity wouldn't go amiss. This science is so bad it would actually distract me from a decent story even if there were one; as it's only down to laziness I won't excuse that.When characters are saved or lost on the basis of fantasy, it does detract from my ability to care what happens next. There are no real, well-constrained problems to ponder, to guess how characters might survive; no judgement can be made of likely outcomes, on any basis but the most fundamental rules of narrative Has a character been bad? Have they been redeemed yet? Will redemption require a noble sacrifice to save their fellow crew? Such basic (and vague) narrative rules are obeyed, but no peril nor solution is feasible, giving the whole story a pointless, vacuous feel.So don't confuse this space fantasy with science fiction; there's not a bit of science in it. We have unexplained artificial gravity, vanishing when the power does! It's only set in 2025! The FIRST manned Mars mission uses a ship like a futuristic luxury yacht inside, with ample floor space and bright white light. With Carrie-Anne Moss's side-boob shower shots so early, and unashamedly blatant nipple shots later on, it's certainly pleasing to look at; just don't expect plot that withstands any scrutiny. Examples follow...The opening's as clumsy as any set-up could be, giving a vague nod to the half-baked reasons why our blue- green ocean planet could be a less viable habitat than the destination &#x96;- a red dust-bowl with an atmosphere 1% as dense. A case of bad predictions? Well they claim the world was poisoned, beyond being saved, as early as 2000 -- the film's release date! However pessimistic your outlook, to suggest starting again on Mars is more hopeful than improving things on Earth is the kind of stupidity you can only learn in college. What a shame the makers had to cram in the popular ideology of the day. Is it not enough that humanity has a more certain future, the more worlds we colonise? We never know what the future holds. Would it be unrealistic to open with a mission to colonise Mars, without the drivel? Is it not something we want to do anyway?Ridiculously (and inconsistently) advanced technology with thin, generalised narrative themes, combined with those hot booby shots, convinced me this film was aimed not at a science fiction audience but at men who need to expand their porn collections. Lately we've been separating works of storytelling art from works of boob art, which I think represents positive progress for both. Had we made so little progress in 2000? Was this film behind the times? I pity boys of 14 who saw this with family, especially their mums. Even boobs could be wasted on those poor lads, who may have simply cringed &#x96;- a real shame.The characters are 2D and, for astronauts, astonishingly anti-intellectual and ignorant according to their unbelievable dialogue. Watch this film if you're too drunk/stoned to care about storytelling, and if you know no better science than the lazy researchers in the production team. Otherwise don't waste bandwidth - - let alone money -- downloading.Powering down to the planet at such an angle requires no equations to see its wrongness! Any intuitive understanding, or just a good eye for Angry Birds Space, is plenty!Technical restrictions on plot, regarding fuel and so on, feel inconsistent and arbitrary; they're cumbersomely received from the dialogue.This is the opposite of hard science fiction; it won't get people thinking about what advances might be possible, in what order; it won't make children draw space factories at Lagrange points, served by elevators from the Moon; it'll only provoke, Wow! It looks really cool!, from the slow-witted and serve as masturbation fodder for Moss fans.Oxygen is the only acknowledged problem with breathing on Mars. Oxygen is found mysteriously higher than expected, thanks to plot elements I needn't spoil; this nod to the problem might appear sufficient to a poorly educated child. No mention is made of pressure, except to convey how bad a cyclone will be at one stage -- 840 millibars, lower than in any storm on Earth, higher than any pressure of atmosphere Mars could ever retain. Plus it conveys nothing, unless we know the usual Martian pressure for comparison. (It's presumably elevated above the natural half a millibar.)Many review it just to declare that they don't understand all the bad reviews. Lack of understanding is indeed necessary, for anyone to think this movie good.Some say it's feasible compared to other science fiction! WHAT other science fiction?! Star Wars was more credible! What do we know about technology a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away? Most of us know enough about our own solar system, and modern technology, to chortle at this cacophony of lazy errors.

As the closing credits started rolling, I knew that I had been cheated and that one had been put over on me.  I think the best way to describe my thoughts about this movie is that if I could add, modify or delete one thing, I would put a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie that it sucks, and that the audience would be best served by walking out and theater hopping to another movie, any other movie. The movie theater would obviously not be too happy about it, but if you bought a few bucks of c**p in the concession line I'm sure they would be willing to look the other way a time or two.  The problem is that with such a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie, most people probably wouldn't believe it and wouldn't do anything about it, but if the disclaimer came at the end of the movie, by then everyone would know it already, and it would be too late to switch movies or ask for a refund.  The movie theaters frown upon giving out refunds for rotten movies as they would quickly go bankrupt. What to do?The story here is a simple one.  Earth is on the verge of destruction because of human's misuse for centuries.  With only a few years left of earth remaining viable for humans to live on, a crew is sent to Mars. Probes had been sent to Mars to bombard its surface with algae which would grow from the CO2 on Mars to produce oxygen.  Then perhaps humans would be able to inhabit Mars at some future time.  The crew being sent is there to find out how the algae is doing and verify if humans will be able to move to Mars.This movie was just plain awful.  I still don't understand what we need all of these space movies for, but Hollywood keeps making them as if we care. This latest version of space exploration could possibly be the worst yet. Most space movies aren't very good, but if you are dead set on seeing one, go check out Rocketman.  It's not the most realistic of space movies, but aside from Apollo 13, it is probably the most enjoyable.  In Red Planet, there is just nothing here at all.  The acting is pretty bad and you will be hard pressed to find a worse screenplay out there.  I don't understand why Kilmer wanted to be a part of this, and Moss doesn't belong here either. This should never have been made, let alone mass marketed to the public. Red Planet is an excellent straight to video production that will hopefully just go away or fade into the reservoir of rotten movies.  With the exception of a couple of cool special effects and Carrie-Anne Moss with no clothes on and showing as much as possible without getting an R Rating, there is nothing worth watching here.  Just do yourself a favor and never see this at all.  Don't pay full price, don't pay discounted price, don't rent it, and if someone else does, just kindly excuse yourself from the room to vomit.

The solution create oxygen on mars, and terraform the red planet to make it suitable for coloniztion.  To do that, scientists grow different kinds of algae there, which will in turn develop oxygen.  The plan does initially seem to work as the years pass by.However, after a while, the level of oxygen on mars has slowly been declining, so a team of scientists is sent to figure out the problem and fix it.  Leading the expedtion is Commander Kate Bowman (Carrie-Ann Moss); who is assisted by co-pilot Santen (Benjamin Bratt); scientist and philosopher Bud Chantilas (Terence Stamp); mechanical systems engineer Gallagher (Val Kilmer) who is also the least respected of the group; and along with civilians Quinn Burchenal (Tom Sizemore), a genius bioengineer; and Pettinal (Simon Baker), and expert in terraforming.The journey to mars goes by smoothly until they are near the planet, and their ship Mars-1 is damaged by a solar flare, which results in the immediate evacuation of all the men on the team to the surface of mars.  While Bowman desperately finds a way to bring the men back, the others must find out what's causing the depletion of oxygen, figure a way off teh planet, and hold off AMEE, a mechanical robot shaped like a dog which was damaged in the crash landing, and is now in full-military mode, and hunting down the crew one-by-one.With a story that involves saving the Earth and journeying to mars, Red Planet should have been full of tension and adventure, but with the exception of a few brief tense moments, there's hardly a moment of genuine suspense.  When the plot does eventually get interesting, which is in the last 20 minutes, it ends too quickly, and the resolution is hardly satisfying.  The story itself is a little too simplistic-and at times quite idiotic-for a film that strives for intelligence.Speaking of the idiocy, there's a good amount of cringe-inducing dialogue adn plot holes present throughout.  For romantic tension and character developing dialogue, we get Moss coming out of the shower nude with a peeping and abashed-looking Kilmer, who hands her a towel, while she tells him to think of her as his sister.  There are logic flaws such as how Bowman mentions the Mars-1 will be the first manned mission to mars, yet you have to wonder who built the habitats for the team to live in on the surface of the planet.  Sure, it could have been done with robots, but that hardly seems efficient (not to mention the fact that when they arrive, there aren't any signs of robotics), especially from well over a hundred million miles away.  And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe I heard Kilmer say he and the survivors have to walk 100 kilometers in 19 hours, which is blatantly impossible.  The script's greatest flaw may actually be in what it doesn't choose to do.  The film would have been more interesting had Bowman also landed on mars, thus creating some possible gender tension, but director Antony Hoffman opts to take the easy way out, wiht Kilmer taking command of the crew while Moss sits around trying to communicate with Houston, revealing cleavage in tight-fitting shirts.Red Planet is more action-oriented than its counterpart Mission to Mars, but these scenes are surprisingly dull.  Maybe it's because of the lack of a truly formidable threat that's responsible for the lackluster pacing.  Sure, AMEE is an interesting robotic design, but as a villain, it's weak.  Also, not to give too much away, the space insects that appear in the finale (which also make brief appearances throughout the whole film if you look closely) are initially frightening, but the plot turn is barely developed.  The film is rather predictable, and it doesn't contain any sense of awe or wonder, which is rather crucial to a movie of this genre.  The musical score from Graeme Revell does help a bit in creatind tension-if only in a superficial manner, but if you listen closely, many themes in the score are almost identical to the soundtrack of the sci-fi thriller Pitch Black.  That's not truly a big surprise, considering that Revell scored both films (though it's far more effective in Pitch Black).Is there anything in the movie that's not bad?  Well, for an 80 million dollar production cost, the special effects are fairly good.  Some of the imagery of mars is occasionally breathtaking, but these scenes feel a little too obviously constructed to block us from paying attention to some of the dialogue.  To be fair, it somewhat succeeds in doing that for a couple of moments.  For laughs, there is a rather humorous scene involving the first urination on mars.  Other than that, it's a pretty humorless affair.The performances from the three leads (Kilmer, Moss, Sizemore) are decent.  Sizemore is probably the best, playing a scientist convincingly.  Kilmer and Moss are not bad, though there's an unlikely romance that develops between them in the last 15 minutes.  It's more annoying than dramatic, and it only insults my intelligence even further.  The other acts are much worse.  Benjamin Bratt is annoying as usual, hence his last name.  Simon Baker is unconvincing as the man who goes over the edge, and Terence Stamp has hardly enough screen time to determine the quality of his performance.The characters simply aren't memorable.  Hell, I could barely remember half their names.  They are either underused, unpleasant, or simply unlikeable.  Any attempt at character development from the three lead roles comes virtually from their ability as performers, not from the script, and even then they still mostly come off one-dimensional.  You know characterization is off in a script when first-person narration is used to describe everybody's personalities.Red Planet may please die-hard sci-fi fans, or it may enthrall those who have seen few films of this sort, but it's too thinly executed, shallow, and dull to be enjoyable for those looking for a truly entertaining sci-fi yarn. It would be better if you saw Mission to Mars or Pitch Black instead, two far more enjoyable and similarly plotted films.

Even if you just took high school classes and have as much common sense than voters in Palm Beach you will leave with your intellect insulted and money wasted. I list my reasons below but read the warning. Below that are my recommendations.*** POTENTIAL SPOILER INFORMATION FROM HERE TO NEXT STARS ***This film, right from the start, is cursed with more design flaws than the Palm Beach ballot (pardon the election references). Most of these have been listed in other reviews (bad plot, no character development...) so I will dwell on the complete lack of reality in this film.1.    A lot of people say that the robot AMEE is amazing. Actually AMEE is the worst part of the whole film. Just think for a second. The astronauts are going to Mars to find out why the oxygen is low. So they take a navigator droid. Completely plausible till here. Then all of a sudden, we find out the droid has a military mode. In military mode it likes to attack and kill. Okay, maybe, just maybe they incorporated this for self-defense. But, this robot is trained in guerilla warfare! Not only that, it does kung fu! However, the worst crime of all is that the robot is programmed to kill humans! Yes, humans! Would NASA really program a navigator robot to kill humans via guerilla warfare? It is obscenely ridiculous that this was included. It's as if the NASA crew expected to meet Darth Maul up there.2.    The airbag concept for landing is ridiculous. The amount of gs that this would inflict on humans, would be enough to kill instantly. Amazingly ridiculous idea.3.    The modem that was recovered worked? They said it was 50 years old. I challenge anyone to provide a computer part that is fully functional after lying unprotected for 50 years. Additionally, there is precipitation on Mars according to the film, making it even more implausible.4.    Okay. Gallagher has 19 hours to cover 100 km and jump start a rocket. Take away 3 hours that were ruined by an ice storm and you are left with 16. Another hour was wasted waiting for that stupid robot to show up. Another hour can be taken away for rigging the russian ship. That leaves, in the best case (giving an hour), 15 hours for him to cover 100 km. That works out to an astonishing 6 km per hour, appx 5 miles per hour for a guy who hasn't eaten in two days and is never shown running. Yeah right. Additionally, the battery from AMEE is just the right format and voltage for a 50 year old Russian hunk of junk. And the russian hunk of junk was designed as an unmanned probe, yet conveniently has a working touch screen interface for humans. Sure.5.    Don't even get me started on oxygen on Mars.6.    I never knew that space stations were used for interstellar travel. Talk about a waste of time, money and resources. Highly unbelievable.7.    Another note on AMEE. If it was designed to kill, they left in the hands of a 'space janitor' who was a last second addition to the crew? Don't you think they would have had a trained specialist to handle it?8.    The portrayal of the crew is a disgrace to all the hard working astronauts that are there in today's world. No astronaut makes a brewery in space. They are way more professional than that.9.    Air tanks never seem to run out of air. Not only that, but the oxygen tanks are not even visible on the uniforms.10.   Naked women are not effective mission commanders.and on and on and on.....*** SPOILER INFORMATION ENDS HERE ***This film is a disgrace to every sci-fi flick ever made. Want evil robots - go and watch Terminator 2, or better yet wait for Terminator 3. Want a deep sci-fi plot with action - watch Star Wars or Jurassic Park, better yet wait for Episode II or Jurassic Park II. Want realistic space exploration - watch a NASA documentary. Want to waste some time, have your intellect insulted, and throw away some cash - watch Red Planet.My only recommendation is to science students who can analyze all the scientific flaws in the film for a project, and to filmography students who will learn how to make nice backgrounds and then a horrible film.

Elements of plot and back-story are introduced and discarded with no apparent attempt at cause and effect, to say nothing of relevance. In the middle of the movie I was reminded of a line from the Simpsons when, at the end of an episode, the entire family is trying to deduce the moral of the story.
