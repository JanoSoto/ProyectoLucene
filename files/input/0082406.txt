[{"Title":"Adorable","Date":"11 February 2004","Score":"83 out of 85 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama","Review":" The Fox and the Hound, one of Disney's forgotten treasures, I honestly don't know why this movie is more noticed by people. This is one of my favorite animated movies of all time, it's innocent, it's simple, it's lovely, and just a wonderful tale about the most unlikely pair becoming the best of friends. The Fox and the Hound, yeah, it does go a little overboard on the cuteness factor with baby Tod and baby Copper, but this is when Disney really did mean well and came up with such a sweet and wonderful story that is classic.After a young red fox is orphaned, he is adopted the Widow Tweed, she names him Tod. Meanwhile, Tweed's neighbor, a hunter named Amos Slade, brings home a young hound puppy named Copper and introduces him to his hunting dog Chief. Tod and Copper become playmates, and vow to remain friends forever. Slade grows frustrated at Copper for constantly wandering off to play, and places him on a leash. While playing with Copper at his home, Tod awakens Chief. Slade and Chief chase him until they are stopped by Tweed. After an argument, Slade says that he intends to kill Tod at his first opportunity. Hunting season comes and Slade takes his dogs into the wilderness for the interim. Meanwhile, Big Mama explains to Tod that his friendship with Copper cannot continue, as they are natural enemies, but Tod refuses to believe her. Months pass, and Tod and Copper reach adulthood. On the night of Copper's return, Tod sneaks over to meet him. Copper explains that he is a hunting dog now and things are now going to be different between them.The Fox and the Hound is such a great movie, honestly if you don't like this film, I don't know what's wrong with you, but you need to get something checked because everything about this film is just wonderful. The songs, animation and characters are just lovely. Plus there are some fun jokes, I loved seeing Chief constantly chasing after Tod and then Slade runs over to Tweed's house to scream about the fox but she just kicks his butt and tells him to get off her property. This is such a great movie, I highly recommend you see it if you get the chance.10/10 "},{"Title":"Good clean fun with a touch of heartache","Date":"8 September 1999","Score":"66 out of 68 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  This is my favorite Disney movie of all time. It is, in my opinion, one of their finest. Why do I think so? First, I like its realism. It is not some fantastic fairy tale, nor is it some good-against-evil-good-eventually-triumphs story. There are no heroes or villains in this story. This lack of good and evil made the story and the characters seem more alive than the ones you usually see.I also like the message this movie gives. It is simple yet powerful. The two main characters wanted only the most innocent of things - friendship. Yet society couldn't allow this friendship to be. This movie tugs at your heart, and it doesn't stop tugging. And the realism didn't diminish any by the movie's close. The main characters' problems remained unresolved, yet each finished the movie in contentment. I feel that this lack of a everything's okie-dokie again finish like you see in traditional animated movies gave this story a powerful element.If you're looking for songs your children can sing over and over again, you've come to the wrong movie. Each song is sung in a flavorful yet discreet manner. Little orchestration. Yet if you're looking for memorable characters, you've come to the right movie. Each character is very well developed, motivated by true emotions and the things that the everyday person wants - love, food, companionship. Each character is vibrantly drawn, and this vibrancy is matched by the character's personality. I saw a real person within the animal. Nobody is created in an idealistic image.From realistic characters come a realistic story. Nothing felt written or hacked. Everything felt like it was supposed to happen. There was nothing outlandish about the entire story. And if you're looking for comedy, you'll find none. This is pure drama, yet it's drama that kids can easily understand. This movie had a story that seemed like it could've easily happened to the average person. This is a rare and endearing quality.Basically, I loved this movie for what it had, a heart of gold, but also for what it lacked, a traditional formula. If you're looking for a story with a difference and a bittersweet flavor, this is the movie for you! It is nice, quiet, yet provocative and emotional. To sum it up, it is good clean fun with a touch of heartache, a true drama!

After all, that's why you watched Disney movies as a kid, right? It's just what you did in your childhood.Now, watching it again, about to embark on adulthood and all that it entails, it really moved me. How Todd and Copper, a young fox and a hound were the best of friends. Todd having been taken in by a kindly old women and nursed backed to health while right next door, Copper, owned by a mean and bitter old hunter, is being groomed as hunting dog.Yet, like children, they don't judge. They don't know about the differences between each other and they don't care. They just want to play hide and seek. It is when they grow older that they realize that it was never meant to be. How sometimes societal rules can stamp out the most innocent of ventures. Much like becoming an adult, reality sets in. Life is unfair.It's a truly beautiful movie, for it's simplistic yet universal message and unlike the vast library of previous Disney inventions, as stated before, it lacks the happy ending. The proverbial feel good formula that is the frame work for all Disney movies. It's because of it's bittersweet delivery and surprising realism, that it's become a lifeline to my childhood that I will carry with me for as long as I live.

The two best friends, the Fox and the Hound, meet again after they are fully grown adults, or, when they are old enough to face the fact that their friendship was never meant to be.  That broke my heart, because it was such a beautiful friendship, unfairly tarnished by a cruel world.  If only our world was a happy place, where races and cultures didn't matter, and if only we could recognize those characters as our friends, and not our enemies simply because of our ethnic differences.  Years later, Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing brought up that same point with a vengeance.  And, like The Fox and the Hound, it shows how much that beautiful friendship between people won't last because of how society determines our friends and enemies.  It makes no sense, and it's unfair.  What's more, Tod, the fox, endures more than any other character in the film.  Other characters, and especially the hunter, discriminated against him without thinking.  And we the audience had to endure seeing him go through this misery, all because he was born a fox!  It's insane! Sadly, it's true to life.  And that is the main reason it was made for kids, to point out how wonderful a friendship is, and how ridiculous it is to tarnish it because of a racial or ethnic difference!  And although this film runs on the standard Disney formula, with the songs, the comic relief, the love interest, and the villain, this film really touched me, because I wanted to see their friendship go on.  And although it did go on in some form, there is always that feeling of he doesn't belong being uttered by many of the other characters.  Why?  Well, this film asks children and adults alike, that very question.

Another bunch resign. One dies. Drawings are stolen. Production is delayed endlessly. You would think that if ever a Disney feature were destined for disaster, this was it. Instead, 'Fox and the Hound' is probably the best Disney animated feature of its generation. You could clear a space about 10 years either side of it before you ran into something that gave it serious competition.We start with an orphaned fox kit - pardon me as my jaw doesn't drop in amazement. There have been, what - TWO Disney films where both parents survive? And, well, he is adopted by an elderly widow named Tweed, he develops a friendship with a hunting dog owned by Widow Tweed's crochety neighbor, and he starts to grow up, and life suddenly becomes very difficult, dangerous, and emotionally complicated.I won't give it away, in case you haven't seen it, but for my money this movie has close to the saddest, most desolate, tear-jerking scene in any Disney film I can think of. But don't worry, it bounces back well and truly. This is a long way from being a morose film. In fact it's an excellent balance of drama, action, pathos and humour. My only minor complaint is that there are a couple of comic sidekicks in this movie that are pretty annoying and contribute just about nothing to the story.Coming after 'The Rescuers', 'The Fox and the Hound' might have been the start of a Disney resurrection, but perhaps Bluth's departure really was a body blow. As it is, 'Fox and the Hound' is a moment of beauty and brilliance in the otherwise pretty murky first 20 or so years after Walt's death.Although it didn't cause much of a stir at the time, it has developed a deserved base of loyal fans in the twenty-three years since it was made.The film tackles themes of conflicting loyalties, friendship, love, identity, and somehow does it with a minimum of schmaltz and a maximum of heart. It's one of Disney's best, and you owe it to yourself to see it.9 out of 10Historical Note Mickey Rooney plays the adult Tod, the fox in 'Fox and the Hound'. According to Rooney's 1991 autobiography, when he was 5 years old he wandered into an office at Warner during breaks between shooting in one of his child-star films, and introduced himself to a bloke who turned out to be Walt Disney, and who was in the process of drawing a new mouse character, who he decided on the spot to name after Mickey. It just tops it off nicely, doesn't it?

Not only is the film engaging, but it also has a metaphorical story going on. I understand it is supposed to represent humans and racism, but apart from the preachiness of it all the film is quite good on the level of a whole. A definite must-see. The ending is bittersweet and at many times during the film you will actually start to feel for these creatures. On a sidenote, I used to have a dog just like the one in this movie.

This film is not sugarcoated, as many claim Disney movies to be, but an enjoyable examination at the friendship of two unlikely characters.I recently reviewed the Fox and the Hound after a few years, to refresh my memory of the storyline. I remember enjoying it immensely when I was younger. After a somewhat devastating beginning, the film picks up into its Disney mode, with lovable supporting characters in addition to the central two, Tod the fox and Copper the hound.Tod is surprised to see Copper dutifully take on the role in life that he was meant to play, convinced that their friendship will withstand the natural stance that the two are meant to take upon each other. This film is a wonderful mix of tears and laughter, with a bittersweet yet agreeable ending. You realize why things turned out the way that they did and know that it cannot be questioned, but still wonder what could have been. This is one of the best children's films in my opinion. However, due to some tragic circumstances (including death and necessary abandonment), I would not recommend it for extremely young children. When they are old enough to grasp the concepts presented in this film, I do highly recommend it. It won't be a waste of time. There hasn't been a film quite like its original release.

The two of them are eventually thought that they're not supposed to get along but this here is challenged when both are in need. THE FOX AND THE HOUND is without a doubt a very charming little film even though the story itself isn't all that original and I think there are a few too many clichéd characters and jokes throughout. Still, I like the fact that the studio threw in some added social commentary dealing with people who are supposed to hate one another even if there's no real reason. I think some of the strongest stuff here are the vocal performances including the wonderful Pearl Bailey who plays Big Mama. I thought she brought a lot of soul to the performance and easily managed to be the best vocal performance. It seems both Rooney and Russell aren't overly popular among Disney fans but I thought both of them were good here. Neither one deserves a place in the Disney Vocal Hall of Fame but they are still fun and share some nice chemistry together. I thought all of the lead characters were quite charming and fun to watch. The fox certainly is the best written of the group but I also enjoyed the older dog and well as the new one in training. The animation was extremely well done and especially during the finale when we're given an excellent fight between the fox, the hound and a bear. The amount of detail in this sequence is just wonderful. With that said, I thought the rest of the characters were quite forgettable and I thought there really weren't enough laughs to really carry the thing.

Fox, along with Bambi and Lady and the Tramp, are the only Disney animated films that portray a reality without fairy dust, animals wearing clothes or lions that have formed alliances with hyenas to overthrow an animalistic royal lineage. True- the animals do talk and occasionally sing, but for the most part, they do stay true to the nature of their existence. But, Bambi, with its characters reacting against and to nature, borders on being an animated nature documentary (if such a thing is possible.) And, Lady and the Tramp has far too cheery of a Hollywood ending to be accepted as neorealism. Which leaves Fox and the Hound the tale of young pup Copper and fox Tod who become childhood friends and are then forced to turn on each other by the demands of society. Not exactly your standard Disney fare. And, most importantly, it has a true, realistic, bittersweet ending. It's only been attempted once by Disney and probably never again. Which is a shame because Fox and the Hound has some of the most sincere and heartbreaking moments ever brought to animation. It isn't a perfect film, but its intentions are honorable and that makes The Fox and the Hound a true animated classic.**Note- the current 25th Anniversary DVD does not do justice to this film. It is not presented in the correct aspect ratio. The image has been cleaned to a degree, but there is too much digitization. Considering the significance of Fox and the Hound in the history of Disney animation, it deserves a two disc, widescreen DVD release.

Bird buddies Dinky and Boomer constantly try to catch a worm that seems to outsmart them each time; Amos get's ready for a hunting trip and he's taking Chief and Copper with him. This could turn Copper into a rough hunting dog. Todd didn't think so but Big Mama did. The months past and soon it was fall. Todd had grown into a grown-up fox and Copper had become a grown-up dog. Todd came to see him and was chased by Chief. Todd was cornered by Copper, who let him go because they were friends after all right? Not for long. When Chief chases Todd onto the railroad tracks, Chief is nearly killed by an oncoming train. His leg is broken. Copper blames Todd and vows revenge.

Especially the bonds between Tod and the Widow Tweed, and, of course, Tod and Copper, themselves (The Best of Friends and Goodbye May Seem Forever are two of the most poignant songs in the Disney canon, ESPECIALLY the latter, when the Widow Tweed has to reintroduce Tod to the forest). Even the villains (if you can even call them that) are actually likable and sympathetic (extremely unusual by Disney standards). Amos Slade the hunter is not your stereotypical evil hunter (that character archetype was not established until Percival McLeech in The Rescuers 2 in 1990). He only hunts for a living and is, incidentally voiced by (and is even drawn to RESEMBLE) Jack Albertson, best known as Grandpa Joe in the original version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (this was also one of Albertson's last roles and the last film he starred in to be released prior to his death just a few months later in 1981). Copper's fellow hunting dog, Chief, seems like a bit of a curmudgeon, but is shown to have a heart of gold, when taking to the young Copper (though he does become somewhat jealous when Amos pays more attention to Copper than to him). Did I mention that Chief's voiced by Pat Buttram, who Disney fans will also know as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood (1973) and Luke, the whiskey-drinking muskrat in The Rescuers (1977), and I'll admit, this definitely seems like one of his more serious, sympathetic voice roles for Disney (The Sheriff of Nottingham may have been laughably evil, but he was still a tax-collecting jerk, and, of course, a comedic idiot). It's hard for me to say whether or not Chief should have been killed after the train accidentally ran him over halfway through the film. On one hand, it would be believable that he'd die, as the train was shown to violently strike him off the bridge and send him sprawling onto the rocky waters below (mostly on screen, and much more detailed than Trusty merely being accidentally knocked over by the dogcatcher's wagon skidding to a sudden halt in Lady and the Tramp (1955)), and it would've fully justified Copper and Amos temporarily being upset with Tod for some time after the incident. However, Chief seemed somewhat admirable underneath his curmudgeon-like mannerisms (though not quite on par with the aforementioned Trusty in terms of likableness) and so it may be good that he survived (Incidentally, Trusty and Chief would've BOTH ended up dying in their respective films had executive meddling as TV Tropes calls it, not decided to spare them, which makes one wonder why they DID kill off some perfectly likable characters in later Disney films such as The Lion King II Simba's Pride, Tarzan and even The Princess and the Frog).Anyways, The Fox and the Hound is again, a beautiful goodbye to classic Disney, as (I forgot to mention earlier) even when Disney did recover from the critical disaster of The Black Cauldron (with the likes of The Great Mouse Detective, Oliver & Company, and, of course, The Little Mermaid), Disney animation was never truly the same again. The words The End conclude the entire film in a way almost no previous Disney film had done before (except possibly Bambi and The Rescuers) An audio flashback of young Tod and Copper saying however they'll always be friends forever (Yeah, forever.) with a soft sweet finale medley blending the aforementioned Best of Friends and Goodbye May Seem Forever together.

Rarely criticized either, The Fox and the Hound' missed success is somewhat complex to comprehend because it both succeeds in touching a sensitive chord and illustrated the perfect case of a film that could have been much more better but lacked something special at the end. It's been years and years since I have been watching it but it was enough to remember the story and the following review conveys my feeling only as a kid, which probably gives some partial reasons for the film's mixed reception.I guess what makes the film so appealing is that behind the friendship story between two innocent little animals who ignore everything about their ancestral rivalry is that it celebrates more the innocence of childhood than the importance of friendship. As kids, we tend to ignore the barriers and open our hearts more genuinely, when Copper meets Todd, they spontaneously play hide-and-seek and their gradual friendship fill the film with the tenderness needed to let us expect the worse when adult time will come. This stress is confirmed by the antagonism between the two neighbors, Widow Tweed who adopted Todd, after her mother left him in the farm before being killed by a hunter &#x85; and Amos Slade, a hunter himself. The death happens off-screen and its horror is conveyed by the shocked expression of Big Mama Owl who witnessed the sacrifice of Todd's mother, this scene echoes the iconic Bambi's mother death scene and made the presence of Slade more unsettling, as a perpetual menace for Todd. Slade isn't by essence a villain, since he's Copper's master, but he'll develop a gradual hostility toward Todd, along with his other dog, much older than Copper, named Chief.The relevance of the story is that it questions how we keep being conditioned by our innate heritage, and again it's less about the friendship than, its resistance to natural obstacles. The danger is that as time goes by, the two little friends realize that they are meant to be enemies, and as adorable as the first scenes were, I was waiting for the moment they would become enemies, wondering about the way the conflict would be solved. Undoubtedly the last ten minutes of the film belongs to some of the best that Disney climactic and concluding sequences with the fight between Todd and Copper, the last-minute entrance of the scary red-eyed bear, the only truly 'villainous' character and the crucial moment when Slade is about to shoot an exhausted Todd before Copper makes it clear to his Master that there is at least one fox that must be spared. Happy or sad ending, it's up to the viewer but I remember the impact of the last shot, and while I write these lines I have goose bumps remembering Todd and Copper living separately and the voice-over reminding us that they were great friends. The ending is magical, the beginning is great &#x85; I wish I could stop the review here, but for honesty's sake, I have to mention that the problem of the film is in the middle.As a kid, I remember I got myself ready for an event I thought to be inevitable Chief's death. I thought the only thing that could have lit Copper's anger would be the death of his beloved sourpuss mentor. I liked Chief and I didn't want him to die but neither did I for more sympathetic Disney characters who still met their demise in their respective films. Anyway, even as a kid, I thought it was the only way for the narrative to evolve. But it didn't, the Disney animators probably though that the death of Todd's mother was upsetting enough, that it would create a disconcerting feeling, but now, with some perspective, we can all agree that good ol' Chief would have improved the film's quality by choosing to die. He doesn't play a significant part to the story after the accident and let's face it, why would Copper blame for Todd for having 'almost' killed him especially since it was an obvious case of self-defense (sorry for the technicality). That didn't make sense. and I would have been tempted to make the same reproach about the character of Dixie, the female fox, because the movie should have focused on the friendship story and avoid a forced romantic subplot (there are enough romantic Disney films for that) one emotional relationship was alone, but at least, it wasn't overdone and I guess it had to provoke Todd's protective instinct and readiness to fight Copper.There is no other criticism apart that the film is very adult and sober in its material and hardly saves the mood with catchy songs or memorable subplots, the two birds were cute but the running gag involving the worm could have been used for any other film, while a subplot should intelligently interfere with the main story. As for the songs, I'm incapable to remember one, but I guess not all the Disney films are meant to be musicals, and the score is so charming and haunting it accompanies my memories with sweet and very tender images. And the last five minutes of the film, redeem the little flaws I mentioned because they convey with a heartbreaking poetry the emotional core of the film, which is a beautiful friendship that resisted life's adversity. Rarely mentioned among Disney's best films, The Fox and the Hound is still the ultimate Disney friendship story, and also, an endearing classic.

It is the perfect Disney movie for so many reasons. Like other movie before or after he took hearts by storm. Even though there might be no happy end.Rent it, Watch it, Love it.

Just recently however, I got the opportunity to watch the movie again, and I was able to find new things about the movie that I wasn't able to find nearly a decade ago when I saw the movie for the first time. Unfortunately one of the first things I noticed about the film after I watched it again was that, at just under an hour and a half running time, the film tried to cram too much plot into too little time and space, making the plot of the film feel rushed and too fast paced. Take for example the relationship between the fox protagonist Todd and his new friend Vixey, the two meet, play together, and the next thing the viewer knows, Vixey wants to have a family with Todd, they are staying up watching the moon rise, and then they spend the night together at Vixey's home. Although all this took up in the film universe just under a day, all the above took up just about ten minutes of film time, and Disney Studios easily could have tagged on another ten minutes at the most to flesh out the relationship and not have it feel so rushed. Aside from that, the Fox and the Hound has memorable characters, great music, and a moral story.

The movie comes after the truly sad period at Disney during the 1970s--recycled characters AND animation from past films. (shudder) It's too depressing.Most say that the studio really began to get its groove back with the GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, 1986, but I really think the start of the renaissance was THE FOX AND THE HOUND. The lush backgrounds are reminiscent of BAMBI (and hard-core fans will see two tips of the hat to BAMBI --NOT recycled animation) and I think the characters of Copper, Tod, and Widow Tweed are beautifully animated.The story involves the friendship between a fox cub and a puppy destined to be a hunting dog, and of course, things go to hell, and partially resolve at the end.Some people have commented the level of violence may be too much when these two grow up and face off, but frankly, unless you have a VERY impressionable young kid you really don't have to worry. Don't get me wrong -- the fight scenes are harrowing, especially when a wounded grizzly bear is thrown into the mix--but I think it just adds to the drama.The messages are all good. . .the most important one being that blind hatred either cripples you or eventually gets you killed.The only thing I didn't like is the truly awful songs.

As the movie is a masterpiece for its intruism (I know, thats not a real word)rather than its fantasy, children younger than six most likely would rather watch Cinderella or The Lion King. The fact that the movie also doesn't have the typical happy ending (Todd and Copper stay friends, but must lead lives separate from one another) may also have something to do with its lesser popularity among young children. I'm thirteen years old right now, and only yesterday I was watching this film, which I came across while rooting through some of my old movies. I was surprised at how moved I was by it, particularly when Copper turned against Todd and was helping Amos set the traps around the game preserve, and even slightly embarrassed that a child's movie could affect me so (like I said, I'm thirteen, the age of the ever-existent peer-pressure-to-be-cool). Though I could remember many of the scenes almost perfectly, I couldn't remember identifying with the characters as much before; I'm not saying that the emotion went completely over my head when I was younger, but I'm just saying it affected me more this time around.

Also the bond when it comes to friendship is actually heartwarming in this. When it comes to friendship, the test of time plays a big part. The development and the animation is also really well done. There are no musical numbers (well there is, but it's very subtle) or anything like that, this is strictly based on the development of the friendship.

This is a very good movie, although I wouldn't rank it as high as films like Pinocchio or Lady and the Tramp.Musically, this film leaves a lot to be desired. It just doesn't have the same memorable tunes as some of the other Disney films. The score seems rather generic... nothing really special. However, the voice acting of young Copper is just precious.The animation was bit plain for my tastes, but not all of it was bad. For example, the way young Tod and Copper were animated as pups was absolutely adorable! In fact, this movie would probably get more, Awww,s than laughs.

I would've liked to see them focus more on building the main characters.But despite its flaws, the Fox and the Hound is truly one of the more powerful Disney films.

But not Disney, oh no. Reading the blurb to 'The Fox and the Hound', I found words to the effect of This film is exactly like 'Bambi' - ain't it swell?Well, I guess that's _one_ way to catch your critics off guard...That said, I had a great time watching 'The Fox and the Hound'. It tells the story of a fox kit called Tod and a hound pup called Copper. They are best friends. There is a snag, however - Copper is owned by Amos Slade, who is a hunter. The problems really start when Amos takes Copper away and teaches him how to hunt. And yes, foxes are on his hit list.The film starts off cute. Like, really cute. Tod and Copper are two of the most ingratiatingly cute little sods you're ever likely to see. Widow Tweed (the lovely old lady who adopts Tod and keeps him as a pet) is oh-so-nice. The humour of Dinky and Boomer (two birds &#150; Boomer's a woodpecker but I haven't figured out what Dinky is yet) trying to catch a caterpillar is quaint to say the least, and Big Mamma Owl singing 'The Best of Friends' is very sentimental. But you know what? I actually found it endearing. I wish more films made me feel this warm and fuzzy.Anyway, after this, Tod and Copper grow up, and Copper becomes a merciless killer. The tone of the film changes, too, maturing with the characters. Conflict ensues as Tod and Copper are forced to decide where their loyalties lie.Finally, in the climax of the film Tod attacks a bear. Let me reiterate that Tod (a fox) attacks a bear (a bear). Like, wow. As foxes go, Tod is certifiably badass.So 'The Fox and the Hound' is a sweet little film that wears its heart on its sleeves. It is successfully endearing and has a core message that no human being could argue with. This is one of those films that everyone should see.

Thankfully, other animated features at the time scored big Ralph Bakshi's Lord of the Rings (1978) and Martin Rosen's Watership Down (1978). Other films failed though, as the 80s rolled in, things seemed to get worse.The Fox and the Hound was not an easy book to adapt, and this ended up frustrating several people who worked on the film. The Rescuers was a film that showed ambition and had excitement (Which was long-awaited in a Disney film back then), but Fox seemed to be a much different story.In the film, the fox kitten Tod is separated from his mother, who is shot. He is adopted by the Widow Tweed, as she raises the kitten. Tod then meets Copper, a hound dog owned by the hunter Amos Slade. Amos Slade is a trigger-happy nut who already has a disdain for Tod after chaos on his farm. However, Tod and Copper develop a strong friendship, until Copper has to leave on a hunting trip.He returns as a grown dog, and he tells Tod that they can't be friends anymore. Big Mama, Tod's friend, tries to convince him beforehand that Copper won't be his friend forever. Tod doesn't agree, but pretty soon, he finds himself at odd ends with his friend after causing Amos' older Chief to nearly die. Thus Copper swears revenge. From there, The Fox and the Hound takes off. It's a much darker story, as it's mostly unhappy throughout. The main theme in this film is acceptance, as Tod begins to accept that time changes things. He loses his best friend, and Widow Tweed later has to abandon him. The last part of the film is Tod's life in the forest and how he falls in love with Vixey.The love story seemed a bit contrived and rushed, but it was acceptable. Unfortunately, Copper still believes Tod caused Chief to get injured, (He was originally going to die, which I think, would've made the story more intense) so he still wants revenges. Amos and Copper go into the game preserve to hunt Tod down, leading up to a surprisingly intense climax where Tod and Copper's fight is interrupted by an angered grizzly bear. The bear scene shows some of the strongest animation in any Disney film, and at the time, the animation looked better than anything else in the animation industry during that era, as it came close to the Golden Age Disney classics in terms of the animation.The Fox and the Hound ends with a somewhat unhappy ending, a first for a Disney film. Tod and Copper live separately, but are still friends at heart. This ending was suitable, again, playing into the whole theme of acceptance. Some looked at this film as a critique on social situations and how people quickly disregard others based who they are. I say that critique is actually true.Here is a Disney film with a melancholic and often heartwarming story, two strong lead characters and stellar animation. One thing that did not work was the comic relief with the two birds Dinky and Boomer. They were obviously added to give the film a lighter side, it ultimately backfires, as these bumbling birds do nothing but pursue a crafty caterpillar. One exception was when they get fried by a telephone phone, otherwise the rest didn't really work. The love story felt a little contrived. The songs were definitely not the strongest. Hunting Man was rather silly but enjoyable, Goodbye May Seem Forever was one of the better songs, along Best of Friends. I found Lack of Education to be quite funny, but a bit of an unnecessary way of executing the scene where Big Mama tells Tod that Copper won't be his friend forever. The score was alright, but it feels a bit dated. It works well in the film, though.The Fox and the Hound was a film with a troubled history (The departure of Don Bluth and 14 animators, the delay and many other factors) and it ultimately works while it has some pretty good-sized flaws. Overall, it's a surprisingly melancholic film coming from Disney with a lot of redeeming qualities. It's a good Disney film that is definitely worth it.A 9.2 out of 10.

I have come to like the movie much more since I was a teenager and had experienced losing friends over time. I think this film is more mature than most Disney pictures and maybe this is why it took me a while to warm up to it. I had to have the experience first before I could truly relate.I have noticed that the darker Disney movies, such as Pinocchio, the Black Cauldron, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Fox and the Hound and also to some extent Sleeping Beauty were always more special to me than the normal Disney fare. Maybe this is, because they came a bit more unexpected.The animation is very good, I think. Sure, it is nowhere near that of the early Disneys and also not as good as the animation done in the nineties, but it is a large step forward from Robin Hood and The Rescuers I think the saturated and natural colors really fitted the mood, even though the backgrounds were static.I read in many comments, that this is a wonderful tale of friendship. I think what is even more important about the movie is that it shows that hatred or the feeling of despising one another because of difference between people is learned. Remember, Copper does not hate Tod before he goes on that hunting trip. After that he is changed, there is no hate yet but he says he has to stick to the convictions and a fox and a hound cannot be friends, the have to be enemies. Only after Chief's accident does this really turn into hate. Had Copper not undergone his education, his first thought after the accident would never have been that Tod had wanted to hurt chief deliberately.It may be a little far fetched to show this in a fable since after all, foxes and hounds are not just different races but different species. But since many people feel moved by the picture, it must have worked. I think this is even more important message than the one on friendship, for it shows the true reasons of racism, or even contempt between different classes.This is not a movie that shows your typical blah blah friendship is what's most important, everything is fine if only you got love in your life message as so many other Disney movies or so called kid's movies from the United States do. It is more complex and goes a lot deeper and for that, it is really special to me.

I don't know much about the creation of this film, nor about its source material, but I don't feel especially compelled to. The Fox and the Hound features moments that try to attain the kind of drama of Disney's very earliest work, but by the end comes off as little more than a retread of past Disney films with much weaker animation and less compelling characters, despite some psychological content that might have held potential for more mature storytelling.Structurally, this thing is a straight lift of Bambi. The first half details Tod the Fox and his days as a child learning the ways of the world. Interestingly, the film kicks off with a surprisingly dark tone, killing off the mother in the first scene and leaving an orphaned cub to be taken in by Tweed the widow. Already, some interesting themes are introduced as we see Tod make friends with the hound pup Copper, a friendship that's clearly doomed to tragedy. Aside from the obvious forbidden friendship, there are themes of man's relationship to nature in the widow becoming a mother figure to Tod. Clearly, this was the most character driven Disney feature in a long time for Disney. Does it pay off? Nope. Mostly, the first half of The Fox and the Hound prefers to waste time with a bunch of asinine comic set-pieces in which the twosome play tricks on Chief the hound and get the Hunter all riled up for some wacky redneck gags. In between this is a lot of cloying nothing that isn't half as cute as watching Bambi stumble his way through early life. It meanders and meanders without really making much of a point other than these guys enjoy each others company. There's also some side plot about a pair of woodpeckers trying to get a worm, but it adds up to absolutely nothing and mostly serves as annoying padding.Then, like Bambi, we get the second half where Tod simultaneously discovers his sexuality and the horrors of life. This half works a bit better, with some moments of real power, but makes a fatal flaw with the relationship between Tod and Copper. Tod sends Copper on a vengeance fueled rampage against his former friend when he...gets Chief's leg broken. Now, had Chief been shown as a faithful friend and father figure to Copper, and had Tod gotten him killed (as, I believe, it was originally meant to be) this shift would have real gravitas to it. Instead, it comes off as unearned and random, totally against what we've come to know about his character. The rest of the film simply doesn't have the weight it needs because of this one fatal script flaw.Which isn't to say there aren't those moments that truly work wonders toward the end. The bear scene in particular, though rather abrupt, is fantastically animated and legitimately thrilling, a triumph for greenhorn lead animator Glen Keane. The climax, in which the Hunter compromises his pride, is legitimately powerful as an ending, and in a better context would have been truly moving. Alas...whatever moments work here, they're constantly hindered by what comes before and after.As animation, The Fox and the Hound is a real step down for the studio. Disney's newfound star, Don Bluth, stayed aboard for a time before packing his bags and walking out to start work on the vastly superior Secret of NIMH. His team's animation here reminds of their work on The Rescuers; very well done technical wizardry for pretty vapid scenes. A few of the Nine Old Men do scant work here and there, but none of it stands out. The best work is done by future star animator Glen Keane, whose bear scene has a remarkable weight and power to it, and whose Badger character is kind of fun too. Otherwise, the animation on this film is competent at best and mechanically dictated by adherence to animation principals at worst. It's a shame seeing technical elements so by-the book here. What's even more distressing is that it's still far better animated than the next Disney project, which will barely pass Saturday Morning Cartoon with more in-betweening levels.One can see the process Disney was going through. Take an old framework like the plot to Bambi and update it to fit the trend of edgier animation that was going on at the time. It's too bound by convention to be anything but a pale retread, unfortunately, and it's unsurprising that the Disney exodus took place during the making of this and The Black Cauldron. Bluth moved to his new studio to make The Secret of NIMH, a great, dark fantasy feature that accomplished everything Disney was trying to, and various others left either with him or to start their own projects.It's really a precursor to The Black Cauldron, a film that aims for the same goals to a much more prevalent and upfront manner while failing even more miserably as a film. They didn't call this the dark age for nothing. "},{"Title":"Cult following?

That is one of the main reasons why I just adore this movie, but it is simultaneously an era of change for Disney, as Don Bluth left during development and a combination of old (Wolfgang Reitherman) and new (John Musker, Ron Clements, Glen Keane, John Lasseter, Tim Burton, Brad Bird, and even Joseph Barbera and Iwao Takamoto) faces would contribute to the animation. The songs are slightly forgettable but are still very fun or provoking to listen to (particularly Goodbye May Seem Forever), and despite the failures of Dinky, Boomer, and Squeeks as comic reliefs, the drama more than makes up for it.

But against the odds they find a way to become friends again after such a long time apart. I give this movie a ten out of ten. I give the move, The Fox and the Hound, this rating because it was personally one of my favorite movies of all time when I was a kid. Another reason I give this movie that high of a rating because it is enjoyable for all ages. I recommend that you watch it because it will make the perfect movie to watch.

The widow lives next to a guy named Amos, who hunts foxes and has a hunting dog. The guy gets a puppy and named him copper, train him to hunt, the puppy finds the fox and they become best friends. Amos goes on a hunting trip to train Copper to hunt foxes and Tod doesn't think he will change. When they come back from the hunting trip in spring Copper is a hunting dog now. When Tod gets put out in the wild because the widow is scared that Tod is going to die. Tod is all alone in the wild and then meets a girl fox named Vixey. Vixey is very nice to him and they like each other but then Amos is out to get Tod and when Tod gives Amos's other dog named Chief a broken leg then Copper is out to get him. I think that this movie is very sweet and loving and it has a very good motto in the end. Little kids will love this movie and if they watch it when there older then they will find the motto easier unless the little kid is very smart.

At least to a child. Seen as an adult, it's a bit more than that.The movie is about two young animals. A fox named Todd, taken in by an elderly woman and nursed to adulthood as her pet. And a hunting dog named Copper, owned by a curmudgeon aging hunter. The film follows their lives through their days as two innocent young cubs and into adulthood where their roles in the so called circle of life start to assert themselves.The story itself isn't all that complicated and I'm pretty sure most of its underlying themes go straight over the head of most children. But its those themes that give this movie its depth and weight. The themes of childhood innocence, societal roles and expectations, defying one's place in the grand scheme of things, of friendship, bravery and regret. It's also one of the Disney films with an ending that isn't pure sugarcoated saccharine, fittingly so, given the subject matter.The Fox and the Hound is not one my favourite Disney films, mainly because I find the two main characters to be somewhat bland, but I do find it to be one of the subtlest Disney movies and well worth a watch as an adult even if you haven't seen it as a child.

It tells the tale of a fox and hound named Todd and Copper, who have befriended each other and vowed to remain best friends. However, as time went by, Copper has been trained to be a hunting dog, thereby, putting the friendship between him and Todd at risk.It is an innocent, heartwarming and charming movie that is simply endearing, from Todd and Copper's frolicking around the forest to birds Dinky and Boomers' slapstick attempt to catch a quick-thinking caterpillar. Even the kindhearted Widow Tweed's chemistry with hunter Amos Slade is captivating to watch, especially when she tries to tame his fiery personality after Todd innocently roams around his property. The sacrificing of Todd and Copper's friendship is powerful to watch and Widow Tweed's parting ways with Todd in the forest is heartbreaking.Each of the character is carefully thought out and each has his/her own unique charm. The character development progresses very well throughout the movie, mimicking that of true human/nature emotions companionship, friendship, joy, sorrow and survival. The hand-drawn animation is vibrant, songs are meaningful and direction is solid.It's definitely a movie that has that special Disney touch. While there is no magic, fairies, princes and princesses, this film is a captivating and uplifting story of friendship, sacrifice, survival, adventure and renewal, as well as touches of humor. It's definitely a great movie for the entire family to enjoy!

There was nothing heartwarming about this film. In summary, this movie is about Amos, the crazy, trigger happy, red neck maniac, who spends three quarters of the movie trying to hunt and kill a fox named Tod. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out what was motivating him to do so. At one point, he even fires at the old woman's car as she's driving it because the fox was in the back seat. The friendship between the two main characters is driven apart when the older hunting dog, Chief, is injured in the process of trying to kill the fox. The hound then swears revenge on the fox...for running for his life? I was really hoping that the bear would have killed Amos and his dog so that the poor fox could get some peace. Instead, the fox saves the two blood thirsty companions and is nearly killed himself by the bear. Even then, Amos still makes another attempt to kill the fox. The movie is supposed to be about a friendship between a fox and a hound that is broken as they grow up and assume their roles as the animals that they are, but I didn't really get a sense of a friendship because they only spent about a minute developing that aspect of the movie. There are also some other characters in the background that don't really move the story much or provide the levity they are supposed to. The music is terrible and Big Momma sounds as though she is improvising the lyrics and melody of the songs. The dialog was really choppy and awkward and did not flow well. I got the sense that this movie was slapped together with bobble gum and scotch tape a few days before it was in theaters.I understand what this movie was attempting to be, but I feel that it failed miserably.

This impressive cast of characters makes this a transitional film from classic Disney to the Renaissance period. (We do not see the signature styles of Lasseter, Burton or Selick, unfortunately.) I find the use of voices interesting, especially for Pooh fans. No attempt is made to disguise Piglet or Tigger in their new incarnations, and even Owl seems to be re-born here as (surprise) an owl.

Especially something as innocent and great as a Disney movie. But unfortunately, I found a few that bugged me.First, the beginning it implied that the fox shouldn't be with the hound, yet he dares himself and next thing you know, he's in trouble again! He rushes off and makes it to the bridge where the dog appears to die from a train wreck. The fox clearly isn't learning his lesson when he seems almost surprised to hear his used-to-be-friend saying that he'll be gotten for that.Next thing you know, the dog wasn't really dead... he just got one leg bruised despite being fallen off the bridge from great heights! Of course their owner, the old man is crazy as ever. He tries to shoot the fox while on a vehicle driven by an old lady! He gets mad when she shoots his radiator and the fox things he can get away with anything. Hence why he probably dared himself as said above.Then comes the love scene. For crying out loud why does the fox need a date? He's already screwed himself up enough and is in nature. Some grumpy animal tells him to scram so I did get mad at that point, but then the lady fox is introduced and suddenly they are almost in love, then the fox hurts her feelings, then moments later they are in love again. What?Then the hunter finally comes to kill the fox once and for all. After many scenes, finally the hunter is faced with the fox (after the fox attacked the bear that attacked the dog, hoping to somehow repay his debt) and the hunter suddenly decides he is going to be nice and gives up when the dog defends the fox. Then the hunter goes back and his leg is treated by the old lady out of no where, even though he was the enemy moments ago. And it ends... happily ever after?The final thing of course is the message that humans are evil. But I won't really give them that since people like PETA weren't stupid enough yet.Rated 6/10...

I could not disagree more vehemently. This film is sentimental to the extreme, sappy and unbearable.Worst of all, it's trying to channel Bambi (1942), from the main character's mother being shot to the backgrounds to the hero mating in the wild sequence to the fierce climactic battle near the end. Unfortunately, this film is much too juvenile and trite to even come close to matching the mature and bittersweet nature of the earlier film. Yes, the first scenes in Bambi come off as somewhat cloying, but compare them to the cutesy fox and hound prancing about in this film. At least young Bambi's childhood was not accompanied by bland pop songs with awful lyrics.The characters are bland too. Tod is neither an everyman nor an interesting personality; ditto for his hound friend, Copper. The villains are dull; even the laughably lame butler in The Aristocrats made for a more memorable villain than any seen in The Fox and the Hound (1981). The other animal characters are boring too, especially two comic relief birds whose humorous subplot involving a worm which becomes grating.The songs are unmemorable and lazy. The animation is typical of the Disney Dark Age (1970-1988), sketchy, which seems to be a love-hate deal for many. The only aspect I found praiseworthy were the backgrounds (from my experience, it seems even the worst or most mediocre Disney films are bound to have nice backgrounds).This movie is the essence of overrated, a Twinkie being auctioned off as a delicacy. A bittersweet ending and sad-eyed animals are not enough to make your movie mature or artistic.

A baby fox, whose mother just got killed, is discovered by a kind old lady named Widow Tweed. Seeing that he needs a motherly figure to take care of him, Tweed adopts this baby fox and names him Tod. Next door, a hunter named Amos Slade (Jack Albertson, aka Grandpa Joe from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)) has just bought a new hound puppy named Copper for his hunting dog Chief to train. One day, Tod and Copper start becoming play buddies and eventually declare they want to be friends forever. Trouble ensues however when Amos insists that Copper (Kurt Russell) stays home where he belongs and Tod (Mickey Rooney) accidentally causes too much trouble for both Copper and Tweed. Will Tod and Copper's relationship stay the same, even when they'll become the biggest enemies when they're all grown up?The Fox and the Hound is another one of those films where the filmmakers are mostly efficient in terms of telling the story, and yet one can't shake off a feeling of emptiness after watching it. You have outstanding film legends such as Mickey Rooney and Jack Albertson supplying stellar voice-over work. You've got the good old Disney visuals with their lush colors and backgrounds along with their warm and expressive character animation. You also have a story that supplies a good lesson for kids regarding the values of friendship. There are a handful of things like the ones I just listed that should make The Fox and the Hound good enough for me to recommend. But then, there was an unmistakable emotion I was feeling while watching it again years after I last viewed it. This emotion I'm referring to is, for lack of a better word, boredom. Yes, even solid voiceovers, nice animation and an admirable premise can't quite save a film like The Fox and the Hound from being so drenched in averageness. You'll notice that I didn't even go into detail regarding the other supporting characters in this film. Don't worry, you're not missing a thing. I highly doubt that anyone, including myself, will even remember they were even there let alone remember their necessity to the narrative. So, let's just leave it at that. As for the film's songs, I don't remember one. There were even one or two cases where a song was clearly there, but I just had to listen carefully since I didn't hear singing. Not like the Disney music we're used to, is it? But whatever songs were clearly sang, they were all fairly dull anyways. In short, the songs and side characters could have easily been scrapped considering they're hardly even there to start with. The stronger aspects of this Disney flick reside whenever we focus on the complications that arise between these two friends when they're all grown up. You couldn't have asked for a better ending for this film if you tried. It stays true to the relationship between Tod and Copper without betraying the audience by completely making them into something they're not. Tweed's also an intriguing parental figure for Tod in that she goes back and forth between being very forgiving of Tod's mischief and trying to teach Tod to avoid getting in trouble. Aside from that, there really isn't much else to discuss regarding The Fox and the Hound. It's a harmless flick for little kids to see one time, but not much else. Take my advice for what it's worth. Not one of my favorites from the Disney canon. "},{"Title":"Excellent Work!","Date":"11 July 2001","Score":"","Genre":"Animation, Adventure, Drama","Review":"  My aunt has this film at her house.

Mannix) is somewhat thin and the songs (never my favorite element in these films) very pedestrian. As a matter of fact, it's the various endearing characters which make it watchable - and not just the titular duo (the surprising, but most capable, cast of voice actors includes such veterans as Jack Albertson, Pearl Bailey, John Fiedler, John McIntire, Jeanette Nolan, and Mickey Rooney as Tod the Fox); that said, the romantic interest which crops up during its last third proves a distraction from the central relationship - which is quite movingly developed. Ultimately, though, the animation itself seems rather flat and uninspired it's clearly a case of we've been here before and this leads to few, if any, memorable highlights.

Indeed, it proved that the art of animation was still alive and in the hands of new artists who knew exactly how to deliver the goods.The voices are especially well done, as they are in most Disney films, particularly MICKEY ROONEY as Tod, KURT RUSSELL as Copper, PEARL BAILEY as Big Mama and JEANETTE NOLAN as Widow Tweed.The songs are nothing special and that's one area where the film fails to maintain a high level--but the animation is excellent, the color is fine, and the story--while a bit slow paced after a promising start--winds up in a brisk 83 minutes.Summing up Good but not great.

OK, time to get serious. Let me make it quite clear to you web surfers that I am a big fan of Disney films, and cinema in general, but this one I have always disliked. OK, let me make it clear I don't hate it.To be fair, the artwork is decent and the voice acting matches. Even Hollywood legend Mickey Rooney put effort into his role here.But the reason I dislike this movie is because it goes from cutesy, cuddly and childish to dark, terrifying, malicious, sadistic, ferocious...etc. so quickly the kids cannot suspect something is wrong.First you have Tod and Copper playing innocently, promising to be best friends forever then you have them making vicious, growling, faces and trying to bite each other's throats. This whole scene actually scared me as a 4-5 year old to the point where I didn't watch it again for years.I cannot believe scenes like this and the climax still kept the G rating! Does the MPAA just check the poster for the Walt Disney signature and say Well, it says Disney on it so I guess it means it gets a G rating? And on top of that, your children will likely learn to fight as brutally as shown in this movie, Disney seems to have no respect for the fact that kids are easily frightened and often repeat what they see.To be honest, I found these scenes very appalling for a G-rated Disney flick, and I was shocked that it's seldom talked about on the internet. I honestly hope I'm not alone in my opinions here. Even my family barely feels sorry for me on this matter, but we are currently considering disposing of the VHS.So if you're a parent looking for good, family fun this isn't it. Try some of Disney's other movies, like Sword in the Stone, Winnie the Pooh or The Lion King. At least the latter was more wholesome, used frightening images sparingly, showed little violence and taught a useful message.

I should have waited 24 more. Everything about this movie was sub-par Disney. First off, the animation. Not bad for the whole movie, but certain scenes definitely had a rough 'skethcy' appearance to them, and other scenes with a lot of motion appeared kinda herky-jerky. Secondly the soundtrack. The songs were awful. Awful lyrics, perfectly forgettable melodies, and almost non-existent accompaniment. Aside from the lyrical songs, I found the rest of the soundtrack to add so little to the movie that I actually noticed how lacking it was. A good soundtrack enhances the movie without making you think about it. This one made me think about it all the time. Thirdly, the characters. Disney seems to have pulled out all the stops on the 'cliche-maker' assembly line in this category. Every character is paper thin, you could summarize every facet of each character in a single sentence. (Ex - grouchy old hunter out to get fox or kindly old farm widow) Fourth, the dialog - pretty darn bad. The first fifteen minutes of the movie seemed to contain nothing but the old man and old woman talking to themselves out loud while interacting with the animals. Fifth - Aren't Disney cartoons supposed to be funny? Not necessarily a laugh riot from start to finish, but maybe it could make me laugh twice. They really only got me to laugh once in the whole stinkin' movie. Okay, I could probably go on just a little more - but I think the point is made. Stick with Robin Hood, Little Mermaid, or any one of two dozen other really well done Disney flicks - this ain't one of them.
