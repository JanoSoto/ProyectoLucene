She is reluctant to get involved, but does wind up grudgingly serving as his eyes and ears as they try to follow clues left by a serial killer who gives clues about his next victims and taunts them and the police.While Denzel's character is almost too brilliant to be believable, if you can overlook that you should thoroughly enjoy this movie.  Denzel and Angelina, together with cops of varying competence, try to follow the clues given to them by the serial killer, who gives them clues before the killing actually occurs.Most people who enjoy a dark, suspenseful movie (such as Silence of the Lambs) should thoroughly enjoy this movie.

Sure, it may be a little predictable and a bit 'all been done before' but there is a certain level of originality and uniqueness to it also.For starters it has a fantastic cast and both lead actors (Jolie and Washington)have won Oscars and thats says something. It can't be easy playing a paralysed man and remaining so still and wooden and he plays the frustrations and emotions so realistically that I would imagine a person actually would be like in real life. Jolie is charming, composed and works well with the camera. Her character is convincing enough and this goes for her performance.The support cast is fantastic too, especially Queen Latifa.The film may have the usual iconographic elements found in the psychological thriller genre but they are necessary for it to firstly conform and also progress. 'The Bone Collector' introduces new techniques and a slightly different angle for the viewer. there has to be a certain amount of repetition with this genre for it to work and this is the case for many others, such as romantic comedies and a couple falling in love or teen flicks with a football jock character.I am currently writing my degree dissertation on sexual subjectivity in psychological thrillers and this film is perfect for that. The changing levels of gendered representations is very interesting and both supports and detracts away from the current representations in society.I say, give it a go! Don't listen to people who have already seen it and didn't like it. If I'd have done that then I wouldn't have given it a go and my dissertation would have been short of argument!

I have read all of the previous reviews of this film on the IMDB and find them very interesting. Many of the reviews mention a movie titled Seven. I have never heard of, much less seen, Seven. I consider this fact to be a fortunate one because I was able to watch The Bone Collector without having to constantly compare it to a previous film. In short, I liked this movie. I was entertained royally precisely because I didn't take the story line too seriously. There was not much time wasted on character development. GOOD !! I don't need to know why the characters became the persons that they are. I simply want them to get on with whatever they must do. Another thing that I liked was the lack of sex scenes, which seem to be almost a necessity it today's movies. The two leads did a great job and their chemistry was excellent. Mr. Washington and Ms. Jolie were very believable. The killer? No big deal. I couldn't have cared less who did the killings. I simply waited for justice to be done. In short, I don't agree with any of the harsh criticism that I have read on this forum.

This is a fine thriller.From the get-go viewers understand that an intelligent maniac is on the loose, and could strike at any time. That is the very definition of cinematic tension. In addition, the killer uses dark, subterranean spaces to torture and kill victims. That inky darkness, together with a haunting musical score further amplifies suspense.But, the solution to the whodunit puzzle is ultimately unsatisfying because the screenwriter withholds important back-story from viewers. This could have been so easily fixed with the addition of a line or two of dialogue and/or a brief added scene near the film's beginning. Even so, good plot misdirection creates ample red herrings, so that the killer's identity is not a foregone conclusion.The film's cinematography, production design, and editing are fine. Washington does a good job as the paralyzed cop. But Angelina Jolie is miscast; she pouts her way through the film looking like she's bored out of her mind. The support cast helps a lot, with highly credible performances from delightful Queen Latifah, capable Ed O'Neill, and reliable Michael Rooker.The crime scenes tended unfortunately to be in-your-face grizzly. But at least the gore quotient was minimal.For dark, moody serial killer films set in NYC, I prefer Sea Of Love (1989). Nevertheless, The Bone Collector can be enjoyed for its elevated level of suspense, its fine cinematography, and its generally high level of acting. Be advised, however, that the film's finale may be a disappointment if you expect all the whodunit puzzle pieces to fall into place, neat and tidy.

Some time after that, I rented Se7en, which was for me wicked, claustrophobic (in the good way), brilliant, almost as good as The Silence of the Lambs. Taking those two films, almost all the other serial killer thrillers were a big waste, specially Kiss the Girls. However, The Bone Collector was released in 1999. But, for some reason, it received many bad reviews. I really don't agree with them.The theme of The Bone Collector, despite the fact that it has already been used in many other films, is really interesting. I won't say much about it to preserve your entertaining, but I can say it is very suspenseful, dark, well-written, well-directed and well-acted. Denzel Washington gives another great performance as the paralitic detective, but the big star is really Angelina Jolie. She's very, very pretty and talented, and has a GREAT future. She has been keeping my attention since the TV movie Gia, and surprised me last year in the wonderful Playing By Heart. I'm very glad that she won the Golden Globe for Girl, Interrupted, and I hope she wins the Oscar for that part. Angelina deserves it for walk one more step on her brilliant career. Her acting in The Bone Collector is not different. Her dialogues with Denzel Washington in the film are intense and provoking, and without her the film would have been a little lost.So, when you see The Bone Collector, try to forget the bad reviews and have fun. It is not The Silence of the Lambs. It is not Se7en. But it is a fine film if you want to feel your hands cold and your heart beating fast.

However the plot is below the Washington and Jolie. It is the old killer taunting cops to catch him chestnut. It is slightly spiced up by the use of forensics etc and watching Washington putting together the logical clues is quite fun - mainly because you get the feeling that you're right there with him and that it all makes sense. However most of it doesn't makes sense, a lot of the forensics is bull and relies of coincidence or Washington dragging facts from the back of his head. This is a shame because it feels like the film is just being lazy at times and is cheating us out of logic. This laziness feeds right through to the ending - if you thought that the Scream films were lazy and stupid wait till you see the stupid ending to this! Up till this the film does have plenty of horrible scenes and lots of tense bits with Jolie walking round in the dark with the killer potentially just round the corner.Jolie is good and deals with her character well - despite the fact that a beat cop would never just be able to become a crime scene officer on the whim of an ex-cop. Washington deals well with his character being paralysed for the whole film but does get a bit silly at the end where he fights the killer with just his head! Support is fine - but Guzman is not as good as he usually is.Overall this is a B movie that got an A movie budget.

I'm tired of serial killer movies that try to cash in on the success of 'The Silence of the Lambs.' We've had countless films over the years since 'Silence' that are just tragic rehashes of each other with predictable and ridiculous endings.Now we have 'The Bone Collector,' another typical 'psychological thriller' brought to life by a great cast and director.Angelina Jolie plays the cop-on-the-streets who discovers a corpse next to a railroad.

He is watched over by Queen Latifah, a caring woman, sure, but not exactly loving.'The Bone Collector,' based on the novel of the same name by Jeffery Deaver, could easily have slipped into the average slot, but because of a great cast, is just good enough to recommend. There are some gut-wrenching scenes in 'The Bone Collector,' but then there are some scenes (including the end) that recede into the stereotypical psychological thriller.Director Phillip Noyce uses some great shadowing and a dark, moody atmosphere to bring the surroundings of his film to life. Exterior shots are dark and withdrawn, and interior shots are almost brighter. It is as if the darkness symbolizes the chemistry in the characters. The more Denzel talks to Jolie the brighter the room gets; when they are outside it is darker. Why? Because she doesn't know anyone outside. It is as if the surroundings are tailored around her character's emotions. She's happy, it's bright. She sad, it's dark. Etc&#133;All in all, I was going to give 'The Bone Collector' a higher recommendation than three stars before I saw the ending, but it turned out to be quite ridiculous and average; plus, it was very predictable.

Everybody is too familiar with the plot. ** (out of four).","Date":"8 January 2001","Score":"31 out of 57 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  THE BONE COLLECTOR / (1999) ** (out of four)By Blake French	Everybody has seen it, the notorious suspense thriller in which a serial killer madman plays cat and mouse games with a distressed cop; seldom are movies as predictable, dispensable, or formulaic. One of the most recent in this generation's trend of serial killer movies is called The Bone Collector, and stars Golden Globe winning actor Denzel Washington and the sexy actress, Angelina Jolie. As often true, the production is well acted, directed with focus and precision by Philip Noyce (The Saint, Patriot Games), and creates an appropriate mood for its characters. But even big stars and a appropriate atmosphere cannot save a movie this familiar and predictable. 	Denzel Washington plays a heroic cop named Lincoln Rhyme. He is an underdeveloped character, however, the screenplay supplies him with a vast reputation and experiences as a cop; he has written a dozen books on crime scene tactics and his mind in an encyclopedia of crime solving methods. As the movie opens, he is paralyzed at a crime site, leaving him bedridden in his Manhattan apartment with control of only a single index finger. His headquarters  is decorated with all sorts of high-tech gadgets and a kind nurse named Thelma (Queen Latifah), who is always there for him when he goes into violent seizures.	A few gruesome murders transpire, leaving a rookie cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), whose assistance is selected by the paralyzed but smart cop who uses her as his body to stop the psychopathic serial killer. The killer uses a taxi cap to lure his victims to their final and disturbing death. What is most bothersome about this production is that it teases us with intriguing implications of the graphic murders instead of portraying guts and irony by exploiting the supposedly grotesque images.	The production consists mainly of sequences in which various characters loom in dark hallways, allies, rooms, or sets designed specifically for the killer to lurk around in. Of course there is plenty of suspenseful music and a few surprising moments, but the actual story greatly lacks imagination and edge. Angelina Jolie is the movie's standout performance, but she is mainly used as a plot device to explore such areas as listed above. 	The Bone Collector is not a horrible movie, just a recycled one. The material has been experienced so many times before we can never become too involved in the story or too interested with the characters. What bothers me most is how this kind of story has no cause or purpose; the serial killer's motive, as always, is explained during the climax sequence, and is disposable and contrived. Why do screenwriters create killers with disturbing motives, but no reasoning behind them? Kind of defeats the purpose of rationalism, doesn't it.

Homicide detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is an expert in the field of forensics; he has also been a quadriplegic for four years, the result of an accident sustained during the investigation of a crime scene.  From the neck down he has the use of only a single finger, with which he controls a computer and monitor from his bed.  Useless though his body may be, his mind is still sharp, and circumstances bring him together with a young NYPD officer, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), who has just received a long sought after transfer to the Youth Services Division.  Destiny takes her elsewhere, however.  		When she is the first officer to arrive at a crime scene, Donaghy proceeds to secure the area and take the appropriate measures to insure that any evidence is not compromised.  Rhyme is consulted on the case (a murder), and takes note of the precision employed  by Donaghy in handling the crime scene.  When he meets her, he learns that while at the academy she had read one of his books on the subject (He has written a dozen, on forensics and related issues).  Rhyme then presses her into service as his eyes and ears, to physically do at a crime scene what he cannot, by talking her through each step via radio.  Reluctant initially, Donaghy soon exhibits an affinity for forensics and becomes much more than merely the physical extension of Rhyme; they become partners, and continue with the case accordingly. 	`The Bone Collector' offers some chilling moments, especially in two scenes, one of which involves a steam pipe, the other, lots of rats.  In each case, it is all the more horrifying because the victims can see exactly what is about to happen to them, they have time to think about it, and there is absolutely nothing they can do about it.  It makes for an eerie, disconcerting story, and though inherently dark it never descends to the appalling level of a predecessor in the genre, `Seven.'  Washington gives a top notch performance, keeping Rhyme interesting though confined to bed for the entire movie, and Jolie takes Amelia to a believable level that far surpasses the typical ingenue rendering of such characters.  Unfortunately, character development, on the whole, is sacrificed for sensationalism; with the exception of Rhyme, whose character is readily established, we are offered mere glimpses of the rest.  We have hints as to what motivates Amelia, but we are left guessing as to the agenda of Captain Cheney (Michael Rooker).  Along the way, some characters are used like obstacles thrown into the path of a race track (Cheney is one, a bookstore clerk is another), with the sole intent of manipulating the audience.  With a little more depth, this could have been a remarkable movie.  												The supporting cast includes Queen Latifah, who brings a welcome presence to the film as Rhyme's nurse, Thelma; Ed O'Neill (Detective Sellitto); Leland Orser (Richard Thompson); Mike McGlone (Detective Solomon), Luis Guzman (Eddie Ortiz); and Arthur Holden (Bookstore clerk).  While this film provides for some real gut wrenching reactions, it is not `The Silence of the Lambs.'  On a dark night, however, when you're alone in your living room with nothing but the flickering of the television and the wind howling outside, it'll do.  I rate this one 7/10.

Phillip Noyce is a prime example of this. In my opinion, he is one of the very worst directors, not only working today, but in the whole history of Hollywood cinema (he's got Ed Wood beaten by a mile); and this view is reinforced every time I watch (or, more appropriately, endure) one of his films (I would call them something else, but bad language will prevent this review from being posted I'm afraid). I'm not sure if the problem lies in his limited capabilities for the art of storytelling, or in his appalling penchant for choosing wretched screenplays, but the truth is that all of them (and I regret to admit I have seen no less than six) have made me wonder whether to laugh or cry at their incompetence, or simply go to sleep from the boredom. The Bone Collector is, of course, no exception. In fact, I think Noyce has outdone himself with it, as it is an exceptionally terrible movie. I cannot find a single redeeming feature in it. For one, Jolie is quite obviously miscast, and even the usually solid Washington takes this as an opportunity to overact (Well, It's not like there's any actor's director around on set to restrain him, is there?). The storyline is absurd from its very inception, and I find it extremely hilarious that it pretends to be about the elusive science of evidence-gathering, when this kind of left-there-on-purpose evidence that only a movie killer would leave, is precisely the one kind that requires no talent at all to find. BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT THERE. And then the investigations made from this evidence seems to follow little logic other than Rhyme's whims and *intuitions*, or risible strokes of luck. The film keeps throwing one-or-two-line characters at you so that you wonder which one the killer might be (oh how very exciting), but still the ending won't fail to underwhelm you. I have to admit one thing this pathetic excuse for a film kept me hooked not because it was interesting, but because I was morbidly curious to find out how dire it could become as it went on. But of course, that's because I saw it on TV, and I didn't have to pay a ticket; I swore years ago (more precisely, after I saw the narcolepsy-inducing Clear and Present Danger) that they would only take me to the cinema to watch a Phillip Noyce movie if I was WRAPPED IN CHAINS.Note This review was written before Noyce directed Rabbitproof Fence.

But the killer, who is seeking revenge, is totally a phony savant character ala Hannibal, who has everything calculated to the last nano-gram of the victims' emotions. He had plenty of chances to do in Detective Lincoln Rhyme in a more conventional manner, but he plots these complicated but empty murders just to mess with our Sherlock's head. That is why this is just another unreal techno killer movie. Funny, Mike Rooker appeared in this one, as a pompous careerist cop named Cheney, get it, when he carried the classic Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer. That creepy low budget film worked because he was plausible as just a quick, clever loner who enjoyed killing random people in random uncomplicated ways which never alerted the police. It was 10x as frightening and real as this over produced star studded turkey. Even Copycat was more real than this one. For all the techno CSI geekiness, the motivation of the killer and the plot were really primitive. But none of that was germaine in the story, it was all a red herring.Angelie Jolie plays Patrolwoman Amelia Donaghy, who discovers the first victim on the Amtrak tracks and stops a train, then photographs the whole scene, impressing Sherlock. Like all special types of movie detectives, he gets called in as a special assistant by the pompous NYPD suit, Cheney, as the NYPD's conventional methods fail. Queen Latifah makes her obnoxious presence felt as Sherlock's home health aid/nurse, giving up her usual stereotypical loud ghetto-fabulous schtick. Then they throw Ed O'Neill in as an amiable detective funny-straight-dumb guy, and you have a real three ring circus. Angelina Jolie is the only one who earned her pay, she did a good job in her overly complicated role.

Ed O'Neill would be more believable as a scientist, but they have the smart people of color versus uptight and stupid white folks angle. The subplot of the suit detective, Cheney aka Rooker, harassing our hard working bedridden Sherlock and his female Holmes, was way over done.

Jump forward four years & Alan (Gary Swanson) & his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after New York cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is called to a crime scene & finds the buried & mutilated body of Alan. Amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence & makes a note of it which impresses Rhyme when he is asked to work on the case, he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of Lindsay. Having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill & leave forensic clues for Rhyme & the police...Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night & I have to say it's one of the worst big budget post The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & Se7en (1995) serial killer thrillers I have seen, in fact it makes Friday the 13th (1980) look sophisticated & realistic! The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver & is so poor on so many levels I hardly know where to begin. For a start it takes itself deadly seriously & that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad. The character's are truly awful & I didn't believe any of them were actual human beings. First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down & there's just not a lot the script can do with him, in fact he quite literally can't do anything but lie in bed for the whole film. He is seemingly impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train & thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance, I'm not being funny here but wouldn't any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance? Why is he so impressed with her? Then there's Capatin Cheney who is not only unlikable & shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh & skin surgically removed from their bodies, how exactly did this guy get to be a police Captain? Then there's the killer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? If they wanted revenge on Rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything, I could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves, the intended target Rhyme anything else. Also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people & get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife & being able to walk & use their arms they are actually defeated & nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck! How did that happen? I should also mention Amelia who is a terrible character, she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photo's & shoots rats for no apparent reason.Besides some of the worst written character's ever the story & plot isn't much better We never find out why the killer is using The Bone Collector book as inspiration We never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims. It's never explained why a rookie cop like Amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams. There is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims. Also the killers clues are a little obscure aren't they? I mean a bloody animal bone & shaved rat hair? Logically how does someone go from a bone & rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim & has the whole of New York to choose from? There's some nonsense about a bird that sits on Rhymes window ledge which is just totally random & at almost two hours The Bone Collector is really slow going. There is so much wrong with The Bone Collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's atrocious on all levels & has zero credibility. Apparently Angelina Jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distracting.With a supposed budget of about $48,000,000 The Bone Collector is well made with good production values & that Hollywood gloss about it. I also must add right now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen, I think she is absolutely terrible in this. Denzel Washington just sort of lies there really, Queen Latifah is awful & even Michael Rooker can't do much as he is stuck with a clichÃ©d & one dimensional character.The Bone Collector has to be one of the worst Hollywood films I have seen in a while, I saw it for free on telly last night & I still feel cheated & ripped-off. There are just so many things to poke holes at it's silly, embarrassingly awful or should that be awfully embarrassing? Works either way to be honest...

To capture him, a quadriplegic forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) needs an inexperienced street cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) to be his eyes and hands when investigating the grisly murder scenes.The visuals look nice; the urban street views, rusty, run-down crime scenes and the old infrastructure of the city's forgotten industrial areas suit the style and mood of the story very well. In the beginning the character of Amelia also shows potential of becoming an interesting person with many traits of vulnerability and commitment issues, making a good pairing for the cold and logical Rhyme, but ultimately the story doesn't really pay enough attention to the character development to make it worthwhile to see. Donaghy and Rhyme do grow closer to each other, but it's all so predictable that it's hard to care about them. Washington handles his almost entirely bed-ridden role at ease, but I wished the character had been even more bitter about his situation &#x96; it could have helped to heighten the necessary tensions of the plot.The lack of decent drama would be acceptable if the thriller aspects of the story would be really good, but sadly, they are not. The elaborate murder methods are morbidly amusing, but in a world where the Saw movies are mainstream, they look very tame when it comes to graphic exploitation of the victims' horror. As the suspense never tightens enough to make up for the lack of gore, we aren't really left with much to enjoy (or be appalled by). The finale where the killer's identity is finally revealed is also disappointing; the scene is so lame and clichÃ©d that it can be called a borderline anti-climax for the whole movie.All in all, there is little originality or element of surprise in The Bone Collector, but nowadays that can rarely be expected from mainstream movies anyway. Technically the film is competently directed, the music is clearly above average and some supporting actors do a good job (namely Luis GuzmÃ¡n as a forensics technology expert), so the movie can be comfortably watched if nothing better is on; I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out though.

Washington's performance continued to confirm that he is a marvelous actor. i say this since during the whole movie, he only got to move his face and finger, but still managed to make the character believable and intriguing 2)Donaghy (Jolie) is a doubtful but brilliant officer whose character develops marvelously during the story. Donaghy was not that seductive tantalizing super-hot woman that Jolie is usually casted in most of her movies. her character is deeper and she portrays it beautifully. 3)Thelma (Latifah) is a helpful and caring nurse.

Before the case can be solved Rhyme and Donaghy will have to decode a lot more clues, deal with incompetent senior officers and face personal danger.This film may contain plenty of clichÃ©s but it is still effective. Denzel Washington impresses as Rhyme; apart from the opening flashback scene he spends almost the entire film lying in bed. Angelina Jolie is also good as Donadhy; making us believe in her character even when things get a bit far-fetched. The deaths are a bit gruesome but either take place off screen or the scene ends before things get nasty. The ending is a bit clichÃ© as the killer targets Rhyme and it turns out that everything we've seen is part of his attempt to beat Rhyme as he holds him responsible for things that went wrong in his life. This does at least lead to a fight where an able-bodied is badly injured by quadriplegic man! There are plenty of tense moments throughout the film and the identity of the killer isn't obvious. Overall a solid thriller that fans of the genre should enjoy. "},{"Title":"Too Much Coincidence To Hold One's Interest","Date":"8 February 2016","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" It never seems to amaze me, but even through the most contrived films out there, Denzel Washington could still pull off an amazing thriller. His body language in his comfort zone which is why he more often gets cast as an athlete or a military personnel. He truly has the gift of the gab and The Bone Collector' clearly exemplifies that. It's a bit shameful that Washington is for most of the film quadriplegic. In The Bone Collector, Washington is a forensics specialist named Lincoln Rhyme who works for the NYPD. In the opening scene at the lower depths of the subway station, he's hit by a beam which was the cause for his immobility. As a result, the only joints that are still in tact are a finger, his shoulders and his brain. In order for this film to work, requires someone extraordinary to equally match Mr. Washington's talents. In one of her earlier starring roles Angelina Jolie steps up to the plate as a rookie detective Amelia Donaghy who's been assigned to fill in his running fieldwork for him. And even though she's drenched in sex appeal, backed by a upbeat soundtrack and a tantalizing view of the Manhattan skyline, The Bone Collector could still be a potential dust collector.The plot involving a methodical, macabre sadistic killer with clues scattered around is unoriginal of a story, and it reminds us all of the 1995 film Se7en, but at least in the aforementioned story, it is executed more subliminally. Some of Rhyme's conclusions are illogical and implausible. Spending most of the film planted flat on his back, Mr. Rhyme is able to unravel esoteric clues with pieces of bones and skin particles situated overhead, like Velma of Scooby Doo fame, he can easily trace these small clue fragments towards the murderer being a NYC cab driver committing sadistic acts from over a hundred years ago. Rhyme is able to track down the killer's next whereabouts located to what appears to be a old slaughterhouse. Rhyme is able to know exactly which one it is. Based on the best-selling novel by Jeffrey Deaver, the script by Jeremy Iacone, The Bone Collector had the potential to be a very intriguing mystery thriller in the same vein like Sherlock Holmes, the only problem that makes this film too unbelievable was that Rhyme was never once wrong about all his fragmented evidence. And to top it all off, wasn't it just coincidental that Queen Latifah as Nurse Thelma who seems very savvy at putting pieces together almost like it was a hobby to her. And another reason this film is not mind-numbing brain work can be found in the cab itself. If you look closely on the rear-view mirror, you will see a doll with a noose tied around his neck. I mean would you hop into a New York cab seeing something like that? To all cabbies watching this movie I'd advise you to avoid this one, unless you want your clients to fear you that you might drive them to a slaughterhouse. Even though this film's genre is billed as a psychological thriller, it actually work better as a romantic drama. It might not look that way, but through watchful eyes I can see the connection. We can see through the character of Jolie's character Amelia Donaghy. From her evidence she unraveled from the killer's first victim, Rhyme narrowly believes that Donaghy has the talent for forensic science, but it's clearly obvious she is still very green in experience. He also believes that she is the only one who is capable of digging up evidence to clue-searching. I'm sure the NYPD can find more experienced people than her. I think he's hiring her because he loves her company. Director Philip Noyce's close-ups of Rhyme looking over his inexperienced cohort. Sure she's nice on the eyes and the way they look at each other, it shows they have feelings for one another.The performances are what makes this story at least not a complete letdown. Second-generation performer Jolie bears a striking resemblance towards her father Jon Voight in the classic film Midnight Cowboy. Knowing her dominance and charisma, she really can out-perform her cohorts whether she's playing leading or supporting roles. Washington lets his eyes metaphorically do the talking, his intelligence is what carries the movie quite well. Next to Morgan Freeman, Washington is able to embody an infallible detective none the better.

The film is impossible to dislike and even if not magnificent or original it has all the right aspects. The score is good, the dark and moody photography excellent, even the script gives light to some interesting characterisations once in a while which is a bit of a surprise. The usual elements torn from the two most popular serial killer films of the 1990s are all present and correct but the film does have some interest in the shape of its central pairing, Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.Washington takes the role of Lincoln Rhyme, a top cop who gets his back broken and spends the rest of his days as a quadriplegic lying in a bed in his huge, spooky house. Although bedridden he's still a force to be reckoned with and Washington is typically excellent in the role, especially in the scenes where he deciphers puzzling clues and puts two and two together like a modern day Holmes. The sexy Angelina Jolie, on the other hand, is a young, tough female police officer who initially spars with Washington before growing to understand (and love?) him as their relationship deepens and they grow respect for each other.Fair enough, the plot of the serial killer is familiar and the deaths are all as unpleasant as they should be. Victims are eaten alive by rats and boiled to death by steam pipes. The film goes for a dark, unwholesome SEVEN vibe here which pays off dividends. These scenes come as no surprise but are pleasingly atmospheric and spooky, especially the hunting through dark underground tunnels. One thing I will say is that the identity of the killer is far too easy to guess; I had narrowed it down to two suspects early on and at the end my suspicions were confirmed. Saying that, the adrenaline-pump of the finale is excellent (if predictable), proving that you should never underestimate the power of the human will.The supporting cast is pretty efficient for this kind of movie, with nice turns from Queen Latifah (a real surprise, this one), and especially Michael Rooker who excels as the hard-nose police Captain in charge of the case. Plus we get some turns from distinguished character actors like Leland Orser (weird and geeky as always) and Luis Guzman (underused, sadly). Despite the lengthy running time the film fairly flies by, with a good pacing and some excellent suspenseful and taut sequences showing the killer trapping his victims. You could certainly do a lot worse, which I why I recommend this movie to fans of the genre.

If this one is a representative example of her acting abilities, I will never watch another. She is not the worst actor I have ever seen, but she certainly lacks believability. Maybe it is just a role she is not suited to -- a street cop? The other problem with this film is the script, which does not play fair with the viewer. The killer turns out to be someone totally unexpected, which would be fine if any clues to his or her identity had been given somewhere in the movie. Denzel Washington is good, given the limited scope of a character confined to a bed. All in all, an average movie that is not quite a waste of two hours of my life.

Quadripeligic ex-cop Lincoln Rhyme was looking forward to his assisted suicide when he got the news some sicko was abducting people in a taxi and leaving them to die in particularly sadistic ways. With time counting down between each abduction and possible death, Rhyme recruits rather-unwilling Amelia Donaghy, haunted by her cop father's suicide and thinking she's next, into working the crime scenes to track down the killer. Roger Ebert wrote The Bone Collector is assembled from off-the-shelf thriller contrivances, likable characters and utter absurdity, with one of those scores that's the musical equivalent of trying to scrape the burnt meat off the bottom of the pot Unnngh!

Fortunately, this Se7en-style psychological thriller has the benefit of a decent director and a fine cast who manage to make this an entertaining effort despite the many flaws in the script.The pairing of Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington is the film's strongest suit I'm not a massive fan of Jolie, but she's not at all bad here (in a rare role that doesn't require her to push out her tits and pout) and the always affable Washington puts in another winning performance. The supporting cast, which includes Michael Rooker, Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah, do equally as well with their material. The film also benefits from one or two enjoyably grisly scenes and several well crafted moments of tension that still have the desired effect despite their decidedly preposterous nature.So, while it might seem unlikely that the film's killer would ever concoct such a convoluted plan, and it is clearly ridiculous to expect novice Amelia to examine a fresh crime scene all on her own, and the script gives zero explanation for such seemingly important details as the Peregrine Falcon and the use of antiquities in the crimes, The Bone Collector still manages to be a reasonably entertaining time waster. Hell, I recommend it purely for the chance to see Washington's quadriplegic forensic expert managing to kick butt despite only being able to move his head and one finger.

It's a typical genre movie with all of the typical elements and twists. It's not a bad movie, it's just not original and surprising enough.The Bone Collector is your typical average thriller. Whenever I have to mention an average and typical thriller, The Bone Collector always springs to mind. It's an average movie in basically every way thinkable and is only made interesting and worthwhile to watch thanks to the presence of Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.Phillip Noyce is not really a favorite actor of mine. His movies always seem to lack in style and they are well made but yet in a very simplistic manner. He's a director that hardly takes any risks with his movies, with as a result that all of his works are typical and average movies, that often add very little new to the genre. But I think still the biggest problem with this movie is its story. It's just too standard and formulaic. Basically when you've seen only a couple of thrillers before in your life, you've also already seen The Bone Collector, since it adds so little new to the genre. The story progresses in a predictable manner and the story also features the usual expected twists and turns in it. On top of that some story elements and characters just don't work out in the movie.It's the type of thriller in which basically every male character is a suspect but yet the movie doesn't mange to become truly suspenseful or surprising. Therefor it as a thriller also just isn't the most effective movie around.Luckily the movie still has a good cast. I can't imaging how this movie would had been like with a different cast filled with unknowns. Denzel Washington plays a good role, even though he plays a character that is bound to his bed and has lost almost all of his body functions. The movie is an early Angelina Jolie movie, or at least its from the time period before her real glory days but she obviously already shows her talent in this movie, although I think that her character isn't always handled well but this was perhaps more the director fault. The love story between Washington and Jolie also doesn't really feel credible and perhaps the movie would had been better off without it. Besides them two, the movie also features some other fine actors in supporting roles such as the always surprising great Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, Luis GuzmÃ¡n, Leland Orser and Ed O'Neill in an early serious movie role from him.It's an average movie and therefor nothing too bad but just don't expect anything brilliant or original either.6/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "},{"Title":"Good Story, Good Build Up, Poor Casting","Date":"23 June 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Though I enjoyed the movie because of the intensity it would have been more enjoyable with a better cast.

Or maybe as much as I love the 1950s' musicals and the 1960s' comedies where there were always a sexy lady, a comic star, and a lovely music in a colorful atmosphere. The 1970s were a bit realistic, but the 1980s were a bit dreamy and enjoyable again, at least the comedies were still innocent and not filthy yet. Then it's the sad horrific 1990s...The world turned into uglier place, so the movies largely too ! At the start of it you'd have (The Silence of the Lambs - 1991) a creepy yet great movie where all the time some shocking images will hit you right in the face. Then (Reservoir Dogs - 1992), (Pulp Fiction - 1994) as 2 crime movies that redefined the genre for the decade. So sudden hits for horror franchises like (Scream), (I Know What You Did Last Summer) and (Urban Legend). In the same years at the TV there was (The X Files &#x96; 1993  2002) another great work but with the same shocking images. But why not ? Since that became so ordinary and usual everyday on the TV news ?!It seemed that the deformed human body became a good fashion to be viewed ! To have as a result at the next decade in TV for instance  CSI Crime Scene Investigation, CSI Miami, CSI NY, NCIS, Dexter, Bones !, and as a resistance just Las Vegas or Monk ?? Is it self-torturing for being released like the old horror movies used to do ?, or is it because the refined images of the previous decades became old fashion ?, or does the world itself become more and more violent, and movies or shows are just the clear mirror of it ? Whatever the reason was, can somebody tell me why we don't have movies about the genius of the women's charm anymore ? Like the 1950s' Marilyn Monroe comedies, or the 1960s' James Bond movies ?Anyway, after (The Silence of the Lambs - 1991) a lot of movies tried to imitate the formula which became a genre in the genre. To have a flood of good and bad movies, indie or from major studios, where there were always  one maniac serial killer, and one exceptional expert, or strong cop (or maybe both) after him. Surely with melancholic atmospheres, and mostly with dark concepts about the lowest level of cheapness that the human reached recently. So the list is big  (Seven &#x96; 1995), (Copycat - 1995), (The Glimmer Man - 1996), (Kiss The Girls - 1997), (Postmortem - 1998), (The Bone Collector - 1999), (Resurrection - 1999), (The Watcher - 2000). Not to mention that (The Silence..) itself got at the very decade and after  one sequel (Hannibal - 2001), one prequel (Hannibal Rising - 2007), and one remake for its original part one (Manhunter - 1986) as (Red Dragon - 2002). But perhaps all of that would make my friend happy...Not me !Here, despite everything I must admit it's strong and well-made. The idea of a paralyzed genius cop is superb. (Angelina Jolie) was rarely wonderful as an actress or as a beauty. Her strange lips were a matter to discuss with my friends after we watched the movie back in 1999, and let me tell you that was some hard argument indeed ! (Phillip Noyce) can make the thrill masterly only when he has the right script like in (Clear and Present Danger - 1994) which's one of my favorite movies. However there was more than one thing that bothered me  the violence, the blood, the rats !, and that alleged end with the unpredictable killer had been shown in unpredictably stupid way !, and the fact that I didn't have a movie in the theaters at the time to call it mine, and maybe I still don't ! All of my friends loved the Bones and their Collectors ??, it's only me&#x85;The forever outcast who wishes for a polished sexy comedy or a good merry musical for once (and not to be Chicago please , or &#x96;God forbid- Hairspray !) to get nearly nothing at the end just about every time...To tell you the truth I kind of liked the black suit that (Denzel Washington) wore at the last scene more than the whole movie !

Geez, where have I seen that before? Also, it doesn't really make sense that if the Linkin's doctor was the killer, then that means they were in the room together countless times since Linkin's accident. Not to mention that there's one line that clearly states, Jesus, he was trying to send messages even then. So he would have had plenty of opportunities when Linkin was alone in his apartment with just Thelma, who the doc killed anyway. Amelia coming up behind him and shooting him in the back JUST in time was incredibly predictable as well.One last thing.

As a murder-mystery it prevails gloriously it's well put together, well acted and exciting to follow every step of the way. TBC is based on a book and I've noticed most book-based films are more intelligent, have a thicker plot and are just plain better than films with screenplays written from scratch.( Just look at the recent Zodiac...). The Bone Collector follows quadriplegic forensic expert Lincoln Rhyme(Washington) and rookie cop Amelia Donaghy(Jolie) in their pursuit of a serial killer. The killer leaves clues at each murder-scene concerning the time and place where his next victim will die. Amelia, haunted by her father's suicide and Linc, who has a strong death-wish since his accident 4 years ago, have to overcome their fears and deal with their issues in order to focus on the investigation, save the victim before her/his death and catch the killer before he strikes again. Linc guides Amelia through the crime scene investigations (through radio contact) and she becomes his eyes and legs on the scene...The Bone Collector reminded me a lot of Se7en and though it is inferior it's certainly as entertaining. It may not have Se7en's brilliance( though it is brilliant at times) but I can't help but love it too. The main leads are in top form Denzel Washington's always exceptional but Angelina Jolie is surprisingly good in this too. She's a good actress but I've seen mediocre performances of her too. There's a lot of controversy about the ending but I found it to be very satisfying, though I can see why some people didn't like it. I don't mind putting aside a little believability for excitement. The rest of the cast is decent, though the two leads steal all of their thunder.The dialog is OK, though no one-liners come to mind. The music and sound were very fitting it aided in building up the right mood and it was never too explicitly present( which can break the mood too...see Notes On A Scandal). The Bone Collector isn't as harsh or brutal as Se7en but it's definitely disturbing. It's probably not for very sensitive viewers, there are some close-ups but they're essential to the story (the gore is functional, if you will).I've seen the film multiple times and I've never been able to turn it off when I come across it flipping through the channels on TV. There's some charm to the film I can't describe. It's definitely worth a look and will give mystery-thriller fans what they need...I highly recommend this very entertaining film.7.5/10 (rounded up to a vote of 8, since you can't vote half's on IMDb...)>C.

After seeing most of the episodes of Married... With Children TV series, and loving just about every scene involving Ed in the role of Al Bundy, I was interested in seeing a role that he would enjoy even more... and I can say, that based on that, the film was not a disappointment. It's obvious from every line of dialog delivered, every movement, every second he's on-screen, that he loves it. He's really enjoying playing a cop, much like he did for the short amount of screen-time he had in K9, and it makes the film that much more enjoyable. The film itself is the standard run-of-the-mill, dime-a-dozen mystery thriller with the psychotic killer who desperately wants to get caught(meaning, he leaves all kinds of clues to his whereabouts, his intentions and his identity on purpose). It holds few(if any) surprises, really, and adds nothing new to the genre. However, it's not all bad; apart from Ed's enjoyment of his character, there are a few good things about the movie. Jolie and Washington have somewhat good on-screen chemistry, and the film does have its share of disturbing imagery(which is a requirement by now, for a film like this) and scares. Personally, I found the twist at the end to be so unlikely and far-fetched that it was ridiculous, but some might like it. Not to say that I had figured it out, the film does a pretty good job of keeping you guessing to the end(which is more than what can be said about several other recent films with twists). The visuals are pretty good, and the editing(though at times overly stylish) looks quite good. The plot is OK, but it's not particularly original. The pacing is OK. All in all, a pretty standard film, but not all bad. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors and fans of the mystery/thriller genre.

Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast as Rhymes's protÃ©gÃ©, Amelia Donaghy. A former model turned street cop.The story involves Rhyme's investigation of a series of grisly murders that ultimately threaten his own life. Suspenseful and intelligent, the narrative fails only at the unmasking of the killer, whose motivations are unclear and unsatisfying at best. The casting of an actor who has made his living playing psycho killers makes the murderers identity rather obvious.Since The Bone Collector was not a smash, it's unlikely any of Deaver's other Lincoln Rhyme novels on the big screen, but hopefully an enterprising producer will give us television adaptations of The Vanished Man or The Empty Chair someday.

One disclaimer - I am commenting on the movie, not the book. Those who've read the book all seem agreed that the Lincoln Rhymes character is great, the stories are great, and most of the problems with this movie, for them, appear to stem from the fact that this movie strays from the book in significant respects.Some people are comfortable writing a review even though they obviously didn't pay any attention to the film, leaving their comments misleading at best and downright ridiculous in some instances.THE GREAT As a forensics expert, Rhymes is brilliant. He did NOT immediately interpret the clues in all instances, and needed plenty of help from his trusted and trusting assistants, all of whom have worked with him, read his works, and know the guy is good. It's a well-functioning community where all respect each other's roles on the team. Watch Ed O'Neil's character Sellito to see this in the clearest action.The development between Rhymes and Donaghy is half-baked, the book will no doubt supercede what they cooked up on screen. In fact, the development of Donaghy herself is half-baked, although Jolie does a great job of showing internal conflict that evolves into a new sense of self-discovery and purpose, which reflects the change we are made to understand also happens for Rhymes.The manner in which Rhymes and his team collect and then analyse the clues is pretty nifty, seems close to authenticity. After all his years on the job as well as his academic merit, the subjective skill of interpreting the clues becomes abstract, so that he CAN make those jumps - see Se7en as another example. And, as in real cases so often, once your science gets you into the ballpark, it's often a stroke of luck that breaks it open. Nothing I could see difficult to accept here.The relationship between Rhymes and his nurse Thelma (ably conveyed by the beautiful Queen Latifah) is excellent. She is strong, devoted, loving, and thank merciful heavens she doesn't end up a jealous murderous madwoman as Donaghy and Rhymes clearly connect. No no, Thelma is genuine, and their relationship is pure. I'd say more, but that would spoil it.THE BAD Rooker plays the political cop boss guy, such a tired cliche. Rhymes is well-read, widely written, proven, he travels and lectures all over the world, and some city cop is lording over him, as though they are not all on the same team. So tired, so trite. Not compelling at all.THE UGLY The bad guy and his development in this film absolutely stinks. His modus operandi is so absurd it's beyond insulting. Don't want to spoil anything, so if you want, email me and we can talk about it.A FINAL CONSIDERATION...(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS) Not sure it's fair to say there is a high degree of similiarity between this film and Se7en, but there are a few very strong connections.1. Both main cops (Washington/Freeman) are leaving the force in about a week, for different reasons.2. Both main cops are extremely insightful. Washington for his academic intellect, Freeman for his experience on the force.3. They both take on a a protege, so to speak, and interpret clues left by a killer who is planning to come out at the appointed time4. both follow a false trail left by the killer based on false finger prints.5, 6, 7...there are other parallels, but I don't want to spoil it.All in all, a decent film.

Washington always seems to select the perfect roles as he seems to fit right in and perform so well.What makes the role of Lincoln Rhyme so good is Washington has to act without the use of his arms and legs. He makes it look so simple and yet pulling a performance off that believable is hard. Jolie and O'Neill serve as perfect support for Washington.It seemed that each scene was pulled off with a very low amount of takes since all the actors seemed to know what the others were doing and timed everything just right. I give a lot of credit to the writers of The Bone Collector for putting together a marvelous script that included intricate puzzles and clues that kept me guessing about the identity of killer a secret until the final showdown at the end. Also, it was a work of art how Lincoln Rhyme took out the killer.

Unfortunately, all of these elements can't make up for the fact that it doesn't play fair with the audience.Denzel Washington plays Linc Rhyme, a New York city detective who, due to an on-the-job accident, is a quadriplegic, able to move only his facial muscles.   Oh, and one other his right index finger, which controls a mouse hooked up to his computer, enabling him to investigate a mysterious and disgusting murder.   Through an impressive system of voice hookups, Washington can communicate with the outside world, instructing his cohorts on what to look for at the scene of the crime, and more.   His body may be dead, but his mind is as brilliant and malleable as ever.Enter Angelina Jolie, who plays Amelia Donaghy, a rookie New York cop.   Linc takes her under his wing, coaxing her to lead the case.  He sees in her an innate ability for forensics.  He also sees a beautiful woman.The investigation continues, the murders pile up, each ghastly and grisly.  Tiny clues left by the murderer are gathered by Amelia and examined by Rhyme until his genius and years of experience unravel the murderer's plot.   A final tussle at the end of the movie seems to doom Linc, but once again we witness how the mind can overcome any obstacles.I think this could have been a great movie if it wasn't so unbelievable.  Jolie is constantly being put in harm's way for no logical reason.  Washington sends her alone, into dark and dank places where the murderer may very well be hiding, because he is afraid that her fellow officers will disturb the crime scene.  That silly concern alone is worth endangering a person's life?  Give me a break.  (Obviously Linc hadn't seen any of the Scream movies, where this very issue of never going into a place where the killer may be by yourself is bandied about at length!)A sequence in which an old man dies by the hands of the killer and his little girl is saved is supposed to make us feel good, because at least someone lived, and she was saved by Jolie's wiles, grit and determination; the implication being that an innocent man's death is worth Jolie's moving up in the forensics world.  The clues left by the killer are so tiny and minute that it is hard to believe that the killer really expects the detectives to follow them to their logical conclusion.  The last clue, having to do with the numbers on a subway train and a corresponding police badge, leaves so much left to coincidence to have any meaning, that it strains the limits of credulity.  Instead of an Aha! feeling, I was left with a Huh?But the part that left me the most frustrated was the end, in which the killer's identity is revealed.    Sure, it was unexpected (as all killer's unmaskings should be), but it is someone who, according to the information given the audience, had no right to be the killer.  We had seen this character only for a few brief, fleeting instances in the picture, and there was no reason to suspect this person.   In the final battle, the killer spills the beans as to why he had been committing these murders, and why he wants to kill Washington.  But my reaction was, So what?    For me, there was no surprise for having incorrectly guessed the killer's i.d., because it was someone that I could never have suspected for any reason, based on what I knew at the time.  This is not playing fair,Just after seeing The Bone Collector, I was able to look back on it and think about how much I enjoyed it, for the most part.  But then I realized how much better it could have been if it had been fair to its audience.

The movie has almost nothing to do with the book.That's all I'll give 7 points to this movie because of the acting Denzel and Angelina really got into their parts and that's what gives the movie a little taste.

Too much blood, too much tenses, and too many ... bones. Maybe why it is called The Bone Collector.

Let's start with the bad. The bone collector is not going to be the most original film you'll see this year, not by a longshot. It sits very comfortably in between the like of seven and Kiss the girls. In fact if they'd gotten Morgan Freeman instead of Denzel Washington this Film could have completed the trilogy of Dark Serial killer movies starring Mr. freeman. Instead we have the suave and extremely charming Mr. Washington.  That's the bad news over with. Moving swiftly to the good. The entire film is an exercise in suspense. It never lets down. If there is one thing that raises this above your average serial killer flick, it is the relationship between the two lead characters. Their characters are developed throughout the movie. They both have very dark pasts that now define who they are. In finding each other they learn to bury the past and get on with the business of catching serial killers with a penchant for collecting human bones. There is also the added bonus that the screen sizzles everytime Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington appear together. The chemistry is apparent and infectious. What's the film about you ask? I'm sorry I thought the title gave it away. There's a serial killer going around collecting the bones of his victims. Denzel plays The foremost forensic expert in whatever state they're in. He used to be the best until an accident left him paraplegic and bitter. Now he spends his days dreaming of suicide. At least until a new case that only he can solve is thrust in his lap. He finds the case intriguing but more importantly he finds a rookie cop (Angelina Jolie) with a knack for forensic science even more of interest. Since he's bedridden he has to play the brains while she in turn plays his eyes and ears. If you like a bit of gore sprinkled with a hint of romance check it out.

Take, for instance, the willingness of the NYPD to outfit the bed-ridden Washington's apartment with a staff of perhaps 30 pathologists, scientists and detectives complete with appropriate computers, lab equipment and state-of-the-art telecommunications center. Once these excesses are overlooked, Collector moves at an extremely fast pace, and delivers the chills and action as promised.Several graphic, realistic mutilations are performed during the film, so the viewer should be advised in advance.

Bear in mind this was the first big screen film I'd seen since Rancid Aluminium, one of the worst British movies of the 21st century.So naturally in such an offering there is the clever killer and the cop on his or her trailNo great surprise there - except for the fact that our hero - Police detective Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is paralysed after an accident in the first few minutes.Thankfully, director Philip Noyce doesn't dwell too long on Rhyme's recouperation or him coming to terms with his condition. There's enough material there for another movie and it would probably be a Christopher Reeve biopic with Dean Cain or Reeve himself.What we do have is a bed-ridden Lincoln sucked into the case of a killer who has kidnapped a wealthy couple. We know that the husband is dead - his hand is found in the gravel by a railway line, his finger cut to the bone and his wife's wedding ring placed on the naked digit.Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) preserves the crime scene by flagging down the oncoming train and using Rhyme's teachings as her guide. She records the evidence with a camera and our bed-bound hero is suitably impressed by her quick thinking.Alas, not everyone shares his opinion. Stereotypical ignorant copper Captain Cheney (Michael Rooker) sees her as little more than a glorified rookie who's getting in his way. Yes, nice to know that when it comes to one dimensional cops, Noyce thinks that this will satisfy an Y2k audience. How wrong he is - not that it matters as Jolie has enough sex appeal and full blooded realism to carry the movie forward and Washington is his usual charismatic self. Does this man never age?Rhyme, with the aid of his jigsaw-loving nurse (the excellent Queen Latifah, last heard on the ambulance intercom in Bringing Out The Dead) and lovable Latino expert with a microscope and a witty aside (Luis Guzman - that bloke from Out of Sight who Jennifer Lopez roughs up in Miami) examines the photographic evidence, an ancient bolt and a bit of asbestos.Before long, Jolie arrives at the exact spot where our rich hostage is being held. Well, nearly. She's separated by a wall and at 4pm, the poor woman will be roasted alive, thanks to a cleverly arranged steam pipe.Will she get there in time to save the hostage? Well that would be telling but Noyce handles the tension with admirable skill. That all too rare commodity in Tinseltown is laid on thick in this movie and it's to his credit.Alas, the Aussie director has a history of making cracking thrillers that fall apart in the third act. Dead Calm, Patriot Games and this movie suffer from peaking too early. By the last half hour, everything is a little too cosy for a coincidence.For example, Jolie knocks a bunch of books on the floor and finds the exact one she's looking for; vital information is found with barely a pause for breath...Obviously with such a mainstream and streamlined film like this, it's nice to keep the action coming fast enough to prevent your brain kicking in and questioning the little details, but by the time the movie is over and you're going for that beer, pizza or early night, you will question the credibility.It may be a litle on the gory side but TBCis gripping enough and rather old fashioned with that Rear Window-style pay-off being one of the most disappointing in many years.If you like movies with a Scooby Doo ending then this will be right up your street.It's a shame that when we do eventually find out the identity of the killer, many will have guessed it straight away.Noyce (seen at one point in the book shop) throws in his fair share of red herrings but the problem with the exposition at the end is that it bears little relation to anything that came before it.Perhaps if there had been some mention of the critical evidence that causes our deranged villain to murder the innocent then fair enough, you would go home happy in the knowledge that he or she was Looney Tunes within the context of the movie - not in the context of something that seems to have been made up at the last minute and tagged on.It also boasts the most cavity inducing epilogue of any serial killer thriller in recent years. Any plausibility built up in the previous 90 minutes goes straight out of the window here. Remember those Police Squad spoofs where everyone cracks up, the action freezes and the closing titles roll? This is worse.The movie looks great thanks to some good casting and Nigel Phelps' production design. The man who designed Judge Dredd and Alien Resurrection, lends his impressive skills to a movie that is well worth the price of admission, just as long as you don't question things too hard.

OK, I was really impressed by its intriguing name but as I'm not a big fan of suspense and action, Angelina was always the main reason to watch it. The Bone Collector is a good movie. It's mysterious, thrilling, well-done but I'm not sure if I should write that it's realist or not. In fact, at the same time it is and it isn't. Almost all the victims of the killer died although they were always very closer to save them, for minutes. This is truly realist. BUT the way they find the places where the victims were is completely unrealistic. In seconds Rhyme (Denzel Washington) was solving the clues given by the killer. You may not believe but it was like thisClue a green card. Rhyme  Well, he gave us a green card. Green - forest. Forest - trees. Threes need sun light. Sun - sky. Sky - clouds. Clouds - rain. So, he's gonna kill in the park (green) in a rainy day (rain) near the shop (card).  No, I'm not exaggerating and I'm sure you'll fell that while you're watching the movie. You're intrigued by some strange clues and signals given by the killer and Rhyme, in seconds, resolve everything breaking all the mystery and taking from us some good moments of suspense.

Angelina was amazing (both in performance and beauty), Denzel was very good, the killer was very bad (not in bad performance, he had bad behaviour), the final answer to the clues is interesting, the movie had some dramatic parts...

I liked his thrillers, because he is able to give momentum to his films. Not many directors of the second line in Hollywood are that good. Even in Bone Collector you can see, what he wants to do. But it is very difficult to feel it. The script is not able to captivate some interest for the characters. The dialogues are terrible, the whole story predictable. You can bring it down to a usual mentor-scholar story, with all the standard-problems, for example the uneffective, but very loud speaking counterpart to the old mentor.Without the very good cast -fabulous Denzel Washington in lead- the film would have been worse. Washington is able to make the silly lines he has to utter seem like reliable dialogue.I think we can thank Noyce and his cast. The film is slightly above average, not because of the story. I would have been more satisfied with another script. The film would have worked much better, it would have had atmosphere and maybe I would have felt something like suspense.

In The Bone Collector he is Lincoln Rhyme a paralyzed forensics detective who with each seizure he fears will leave him in a vegetative state, must locate a serial killer before he strikes again. This is a role that I believe Washington is perfect for.  For example, in most cases actors must be on the move to make the film worth seeing, Washington was limited to a hospital bed for much of the film. This gave him the opportunity to stretch out his acting talent and create the suspense from his bed. Angelina Jolie is like bird spreading out her wings in her role of Det Amelia Donaghy, Rhyme's assistant and legs on this case. I must praise Ed O'Neill because I was surprised to notice the amount of wide variety and range of talent he had. From comedic roles in Dutch to a dramatic role in The Spanish Prisoner. O'Niell really steps into the foreground as Det. Paulie Selitto and it is refreshing to hear dialogue from him that includes words that Al Bundy would say. The scenes and dialogue were set up with such mastery I was left with questions such as was this rehearsed, was this even written or was it that they knew exactly what they were doing.

Enter Angelina Jolie, a rookie cop, who, guided by quadriplegic inspector Washington is sent to scope out the area and let her instincts for forensic investigation run wild.

She's also carrying the emotional burden of losing her father, who died in a work-related incident (both fathers play cops).  Then you've got the confined genius who provides the brains for the particular operation.  And finally the whole overarching story is the same.  There's a killer on the loose and in order to trap him the female cop/FBI agent must go through one genius to get to the other (both killers leave 'clues' or signature objects lying around).  It's an interesting story.  I especially like the scene where Jolie stumbles on the first crime scene which is strewn over a train track.  Inevitably a train approaches.  Unfazed (only until she stops the train does she let out a breath of relief) she stares down the enormous phallic symbol which screeches to a stop.  What a woman!  However her bravado is continually undermined throughout the movie by Rooker's incompetent inspector.  Gripes about the film - stupid ending.  It tries so hard throughout to keep you from guessing the identity of the killer that inevitably no one would guess who it eventually is.

Within the past decade only a minute group was superb (Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, a horrifying character study, the highly intelligent Silence of the Lambs and the stylish and sinister Seven), the rest fall into the mediocre to awful category.  Unfortunately The Bone Collector falls into the latter.  I say unfortunately because The Bone Collector is based on Jeffrey Deaver's most chilling and interesting, if somewhat flawed novel of the same name.  After reading the book at a breakneck speed, I really wanted this movie to be good or at the least, give me chills.Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is a brilliant forensics specialist who career is practically over after a horrible accident four years ago that has left him completely paralyzed except for movement in his face, shoulder and his right index finger.  Bedridden to a life of misery which he decides to end with the help of a doctor, Rhyme is called upon to help track down a brutal serial killer who picks up his victims via cab and then tortures and kills them, leaving behind sets of intricate clues. Enter rookie police officer Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie, with an unusually pumped up set of lips) to become the so-called legs of Rhyme, investigating the crime scenes while Rhyme calls the shots from his high tech bed in his stylish and spacious Soho loft.While the book took great detail in explaining what goes on in the mind of a quadriplegic, the bond and attraction that grows between Rhyme and Donaghy, and the grisly, methodical, tortures and murders, all gets totally lost in the transition to the screen. Not only that but in most cases of novels becoming films, The Bone Collector changes drastically and not for the better in the film version.  What is left is a slow paced, clumsily directed, poorly photographed and ultimately boring film.  Director Phillip Noyce sets up most scenes with little tension and suspense, which is a major problem if you are directing a crime thriller.  But even with a great director at the helm, the script is plain flat and the characters are not that interesting to really even care about.As far as the acting goes the best that can be said is that at least the actors get their lines out.  Denzel Washington, who is one of my favorite actors, basically goes through the motions and never really captures Rhymes tortured soul (although character wise he isn't given much to work with). Angelina Jolie, who was brilliant in the HBO movie Gia, comes off looking lost and not really conveying much of anything.  The rest of the actors do not fare much better with the underdeveloped characters, although Queen Latifah gives her best shot in the thankless role of Rhymes health caretaker.By the end of the movie when the identity of the killer is revealed (which comes out of nowhere, which was also somewhat of a problem with the book), some of you will wonder why you sat this long in the movie theater.  The serial killer theme has been pretty much worked to death, so maybe it is time to give it a rest for a while.  The Bone Collector is major proof of that.

And if that's not enough to get him going again, the entrance of Amelia Donaghy, a rookie cop who shows a previously-undiscovered talent for forensics, brings the old bloodhound back to life.With Donaghy acting as his eyes and ears at the murder scenes, Rhyme puts together the pieces of the puzzle that will lead to the perpetrator. But will they track him down before the inevitable showdown between the perpetrator and Rhyme himself?Such is the premise of The Bone Collector, starring Denial Washington as Rhyme and Angelina Jolie as Donaghy, a movie made in the tradition of those murder mysteries where the most unlikely of people solve the most difficult of cases.The Bone Collector has potential on many levels the love-hate relationship between the mentor and the protoge; the motivations that the two main characters have for doing what they do; the tension of knowing that Rhyme will eventually have to confront the killer.But where this movie really excels is in the sleuthing. It's not an easy case, but the oddball duo of Rhyme, who has control of only his head, neck and right index finger, and Donaghy, whose abilities are matched only by her reluctance to do the job, make a championship team.Matters for Donaghy aren't helped by the fact that she must deal with some incredibly grisly murders let alone the fact that her father, who was a police officer, took his own life. Simply having to face a crawl through another abandoned subway system or slaughter house is tough enough without having to deal with those issues.The Bone Collector can be unfocused at times. Is it about a great man overcoming a crippling injury? Or is it about looking to the past as a way to deal with the present? Or is it about a woman learning to overcome her fears?But while it fails on some levels, The Bone Collector does an admirable job of taking movie-goers on a terrifying chase through the dark side of New York's infrastructure.

The Bone Collector is Australian director Phillip Noyce's latest film following Dead Calm, Sliver, Clear And Present Danger and Patriot Games. Noyce appears to have become adept at playing the Hollywood game, a skill for which he surely should be admired.	It must be murder sometimes weighing the wishes of the accountants and bankrollers who run Tinsel Town, let alone the actors and writers. But the rules are simple really. Fit the mould, balance the books, make a few (million) dollars for the investors and you'll get to make another film.	I heard an interview with Noyce the other day. He with others has been trying for years to film The Quiet American, Graham Green's excellent Vietnam novel. The problem is, as Noyce said, the bad guy's American. Difficult politics!	The Bone Collector goes resolutely by the numbers. This is a carefully constructed mainstream film designed to please as many of the general population as possible. The step by step opening scenes signal its essential banality, but to Phillip Noyce's credit the film survives. It's quite entertaining.The Bone Collector has elements of Copycat and Silence Of The Lambs, not to mention Rear Window, but a Rear Window in the shape of a computer screen.The always good Denzel Washington plays Lincoln Rhyme who was a crash hot New York forensic detective before his back was broken when he was crushed by a falling beam. There's a rather neat plot element.He's now a quadriplegic with only the use of his head, his shoulders and, rather remarkably I would have thought, his right index finger. Useful for clicking on a computer mouse.	This hasn't cramped his style as much as it could have. By some miracle he sits up in his special bed with a zillion dollars worth of computer equipment in one of those immense apartments in which nearly all Hollywood film characters live in New York. A serial killer begins to butcher victims and Lincoln sends out police rookie Amelia (the big lipped Angelina Jolie) to be his eyes and legs.There are plenty of conventions to follow if you make one of these films. The Silence Of The Lambs set the pace.  	Gore is pretty standard. These serial killers sure like to have their victims suffer. And they like to work in the dark. This gives the film maker plenty of scope for having characters sidling along, torch and gun out, with rats and other squirmy things about to fall upon them.There will be two or three sudden belts of sound to make the audience jump and it's standard for the killer to want to knock off the cop who's on the chase. But what if said killer only has to knock the cop off his bed?  How can that be made into a fair fight? Mmm. There's a challenge for a film maker.Phil Noyce and the team handled this fairly well and they even let a dullard like me pick the identity of the killer's identity. For that I remain grateful. And I suppose I'm sort of grateful for the following as well. It seems that it is admissible in a film like this for a black man to have a relationship with a pink/white woman. Perhaps though only if he's crippled.But with all of this The Bone Collector, with all of its predictability, moves along smartly as an effective 90's thriller. Meanwhile good luck to Phil Noyce and his The Quiet American project. I'd like to see that.

So, after seeing it again tonight, I've decided that this is a pretty good movie.  The few flaws I did find were majorly overshadowed by Denzel Washington's performance as Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic former forensic crime scene investigator.  Also, Angelina Jolie did surprisingly well with what little she was given to work with, as her character was uninteresting for the most part.  The scene with her boyfriend was completely unnecessary, but in her first meeting with Rhyme she revealed just a glimpse of what she is capable of.  Unfortunately, we only see that part of her in that one scene.Like I said, there were definitely some glaring flaws in this movie, and being a criminal justice student I usually pick these movies all apart.  But I really did enjoy Washington's performance quite a bit.  It reminded me of his work in Glory, for which he won an Oscar, if I'm not mistaken.With just a little alteration to the script, slightly different direction and a bit more character development, this could have been a real block buster.  As it is, Washington, Jolie, and (to an extent) O'Neill carry the movie.  Am I sorry I saw it twice?  Not at all.  Would I see it again in the theater?  Probably not.  Will I rent it on video?

The film actually does have some good character acting though.  Denzel Washington did a good job from a bed through the entire film.  Ed O'Neill, shook off his typecast role as disfunctional father from Married with Children.  Ed can actually act pretty good.  Angelina Jolie, performed as the central character, that was mostly believable. A shy and feminine cop in the NYPD, is well...an unlikely resource for solving brutal homicides, but this is one of the charms of the plot.    Although the film could have went farther into the ugliness of humanity, it went as far as it needed, to make a point.  There were a couple of gruesome scenes of disfigured victims, that may satisfy a youth's curiosity, but I would be very careful about letting tender-minded youths see this. Seeing the face of the disfigured victim has some usefulness.            Bloody murder films will never go away, just like murder, itself, will never go away.  They are a part of the American Cinema Scene, since they accurately reflect the reality of savage behavior that takes place all over America.  There is no community without a Boogieman.

When his former colleagues encounter some peculiar murders, they enlist his help. By using Officer Amela Donaghy, played by Angelina Jolie, as his eyes and ears at the ensuing crime scenes, Rhymes works on the puzzle from his bed. The acting is great. Washington is able to convey so much from a basically immobile performance. Jolie works hard to get something out of an underwritten character. The problem with the film is impossible to figure out.

Thus, 1999 has been one terrific year for spooky movies. It all started with Sixth Sense and will end with a bang with End of Days and Sleepy Hollow. Poor Bone Collector kind of gets lost in the shuffle, a mediocre attempt at horror that entertains, but lasts in memory just about the  length of time that it takes the hero to solve a murder mystery (and that is not too long).The hero is played by Denzel Washington and he is the bright ray of sunshine in an otherwise dim bulb of a movie.  He plays a quadraplegic who was formerly the top homicide detective in the NYPD.  He is in a state of deep depression about his condition and has lost the will to live.  But then a prominent couple is kidnapped and a lady streetcop happen upon the murder scene of the husband and Denzel is suddenly back on the job, his curiousity piqued once more. When he gets a full forensic team in his apartment to aid him and he is solving murders on a moment-to-moment basis, the movie gets exciting.I had a friend who would not go to this movie, because he said he figured it would be too gory.  In my opinion it was not gory enough when you consider the bizarre way that some of these murders took place.  If I had been the makeup artist, there would have been some horrific corpses, but here I think it was toned down so as not to offend.  (Think of Seven as an example of how it SHOULD be handled.)  As for the acting, I think that Queen Latifah did a great job as the nurse, but that Angelica Jolie was woefully miscast as the lady cop.  (At least they tried to explain her beauty a little bit, but it still did not equate that a girl that looks like that would give up modeling to become a street cop, even if her father HAD been on the force.)To sum it up, I would say to go see this movie if you have seen everything out there that's better or better still, wait till you can rent it.

It is wall-to-wall with relentless suspense and powerful performances from Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie.  Unfortunately, after building such a tremendous amount of tension, the revelation of the killer is quite a letdown.I am a huge fan of one of director Phillip Noyce's earlier films, `Sea Of Love' with Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin, which was one of the best thrillers of the 80s.  He has a knack for generating anxiety in his audience.  `The Bone Collector,' much like `Seven,' is very gruesome and disturbing.  The production value is wonderful and creates a threatening atmosphere.  The film is very fast-paced but what really drives the story along is the dynamic chemistry between Washington and Jolie.  Academy award winner Denzel Washington is already an established actor and it would be pointless to point out his greatness.  Now, Angelina Jolie, who won two much-needed Golden Globe awards for `Gia' and `George Wallace,' is one of the most beautiful and talented actresses in Hollywood today, and one of my personal favorites.  I loved her in last year's `Playing By Heart,' a film that deserved more exposure than it received.  I must also mention how much I respect Queen Latifah as an actress.  She demonstrates here, and she did in last year's severely underrated `Living Out Loud,' that she is a great screen presence.Women, nowadays, are getting more front-runner action-thriller roles by the minute.  Recently, Ashley Judd starred in the box-office hit `Double Jeopardy.'  She is also one of my favorite actresses and was great in the film, however, her performance was just too good for the screenplay to handle.Anyway, about the downer ending in `The Bone Collector,' when the killer was revealed, my first reaction was, `THAT'S who the killer is?'  The ending was rather unpredictable, but I think it was the actor alone that made it a disappointment, meaning I wished a different actor was the villain.  All the tension I had during 90% of the film drained out of me at the ending.  By that, it has missed greatness on the levels of `Seven' and `The Silence of the Lambs.'  Oh, well.  Having said that, I still maintain this is one of the year's best films because Washington, Jolie and Latifah were wonderful, the story was driven, Noyce's direction was uncanny and the suspense was very substantial.

The bad guys had the same loser qualities; heck they looked the same, acted the same, even carried the same pouch of shiny tools and unfolded then gently as if they were some relic worth millions and should remain in the wall unit under a light for display rather than be used.  Both bad guys get killed the same way--after a similar fight with Denzel/Sigourney.  You have Denzel talking Jolie through the crime scenes at points--just as Weaver did to Hunter.  The bad guy gets inside the door--roughly the same way as well.  There are differences too, don't get me wrong, but the whole jist of the movie was way too similar to Copycat to be enjoyed.  The film had some moments of real rustic/dated set design, similar to what you'd find in Se7en.  The story line, however, was weak; the characters were way underdeveloped; and the plot was held together by the few homicides that were well studied from pictures in a really old book (just like Copycat).

In reality, how many movies do you see that are completely original ideas?  Not too many, so you have to evaluate them individually, or you'll never be happy.I mentioned Copycat earlier, and if you think about it, this picture could almost qualify as plagiarism.  All that's missing is Harry Connick Jr. asking for someone's SQUIRREL COVERS.  Denzel Washington is the shut-in this time, playing Lincoln Rhyme who's bed-ridden because he's been paralyzed in the line of duty.  He's a forensics expert in an almost psychic way.  He sees what no one else can see.  That's why they come to him after Angelina Jolie, who plays Amelia Donaghy, photographs a grisly murder scene.  Sounds like Copycat was copied, for lack of a better term, you think?Anyway, Rhyme looks at the evidence that Amelia has photographed and gathered and feels that she has a gift for forensics work, even though she's just a beat-cop.  So he decides that she'll be his eyes and ears at the scene of the next murder.  They know that there will be another one because the evidence tells them so.The story goes on from there, time after time they examine the evidence and find the right places to be, but they are just one step behind the killer.  Of course you know that after about 2 hours they will have caught him/her, or killed him/her.From an entertainment standpoint, this an excellent film.  It pushes all the right buttons.  The characters are generally believable, but Amelia's initial indifference towards Rhyme seems written in as opposed to genuine to the script.  The same is true for the character Capt. Howard Cheney played by Michael Rooker.  His complete lack of respect for Rhyme seemed phony because it was just there, it was never explained.  At least with Amelia, you could see that she was supposed to be cool towards Rhyme because he was trying to get her to do things she didn't want to do.Denzel is excellent as usual, Ed O'Neil is good, and in general, this is a great movie.

I had heard that it was dark and gory, but from the first moments you can tell that you're in for a reasonably tame ride. It wasn't all that gory, either.This movie means to be a Silence of the Lambs type thriller, with a smart detective after a smart killer that leaves clues that must be deciphered, but the difference is that where Silence held up under scrutiny, this film makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. It's a whole lot of fun, and seems to make sense while you're watching it, but once you walk out of the theater and reflect back, the whole thing falls into shambles. In fact, I'm kind of amazed someone adapted the book to a film without a little bit of reworking-- it's that bad.Nevertheless, this movie did creep me out. It's very New York and plays a lot on urban paranoias, and when I walked out of the theater (at midnight) and realized I was the only one on the street, I got a little freaked. I'm a big guy and I would normally walk home from the theater, but this movie made me a little paranoid. So I jumped in a cab (which is, of course, how the killer in the film finds his victims).One New York thing that made me laugh, though, is that the investigators would get a clue about a location in Manhattan, shout It's right here! and then circle it on the map. Thing is-- they'd circle about a ten-block radius! And of course the people in the field would be able to find the exact location right away. Ha!Denzel, I have to say, is pretty amazing. It's about halfway through his terrific performance before you notice that HE HAS NOT MOVED. Go Denzel, you rock.Angelina is good, I thought, though sometimes I have to remember which one she is and which one is Ashley Judd. Unfortunately the script has her do a few things that ANY CHILD in the audience would know better than. I tell you, I knew more about forensics from the first five minutes of the movie than she did, and spent the rest of the movie going She shouldn't have done that... And the fact is revealed in the movie that she was a model before joining the police force!!!! I guess this is gonna be Hollywood's new thing from now on Those models could really all be brilliant detectives and scientists if they wanted to, but the pay isn't as good!One person who is fast becoming a favorite (and most desired) actor of mine is Luis Guzman. I loved him in The Limey, and he's one of the more vital presences here. And he's hot. HOT. So that's it.

How does a film make that man feel?  Sometimes I think critics forget that there is a person watching a film and they concentrate way too much on what shot is being used in what frame and if they are using a dolly or a crane or a whatever they are using.  All I have heard from critics since this film came out is negativity towards it.  That I can not understand.  This film is as intense as any of the great horror that I have seen and it is as well acted as any film I have seen, so what is not to like about it?  I have heard words like impropriety and unrealistic and absurd.  And my response to those words are,  How do you know?  How is it exactly that critics seem to know everything about everything?  The problem with this movie is that they say that the Angela Jolie character is much too inexperienced to be handling the responsibility of doing forensics work in a crime scene.  But how do they know that is true.  If you go with what the film is saying (which I do)then she is the right person for the job because a man that does have experience has recommended her for the job and that should be all you need to suspend disbelief.  When you go into a film and all you want to do is be a critic, you are missing the point of going in the first place, and that is to have fun and be entertained for two hours.  Of course there are films like Double Jeapordy that are just plain garbage ( my opinion of course ) but a film like The Bone Collector is a tense and tightly woven movie and if you want to be on the edge of your seat then this is the film for you.  It is not a scary film in the same sense as Stir Of Echoes and Sixth Sense and Haunted Hill, but it is tense enough that it will have you gripping the seat quite aggressively.I really think Denzel Washington is one of the best actors in the game today.  He easily could have won a best actor Oscar for Malcolm X and he did win one for Glory.  And when you look at him in a film like The Seige, you understand his full range and body of work, The Bone Collector is another triumph for him.  Here he plays a quadripilegic man that is thrusted back into the spotlight when grizzly murders begin popping up all over N.Y.  With his genius and the ingenuity of his protegee, they have to solve a crime of a smart serial killer before he cna carry out his ultimate plan.  As I said, the acting is stellar in this film including people like Ed O'Neil.  The only qualm I have about the film is the misuse of Michael Rooker.  Here he plays the always-angry-for-no-reason-police-chief.  His scenes are not written on the same intelligence level as the rest of the film and the only reason he is here is to throw you off the real killer's identity.  The film spends so much time trying to make you think that Rooker is the killer that by the time Rooker has been an ass for the second time you already know he is not the killer, it would be to easy to figure that out.  So his acting talents are wasted on a forgettable role.  Michael Rooker, and this may sound strange to a lot of people, but in my opinion, is one of the best under appreciated actors in Hollywood.  I think he has taken over that distinction from Bill Paxton who has now gone on to be a recognizable face, not just as Chet and Hudson.  But think back to a film like Mississippi Burning or JFK.  Those two roles were Oscar material and they certainly helped him find work in Hollywood but this film is a waste for him and his character would have been better if he wasn't there.That aside, the film is wonderful.  We spend so much time with Jolie as she enters into dark and misty tunnels looking for clues to the killers next move.  And as she is nervous, so are we.  I was afraid to see what was around the corner as the camera became her eyes, we saw what she saw.  And that wasn't always pleasant.  There are some gruesome looking deaths in the film but this isn't a light hearted family film so you should expect that going in.  I also really enjoyed the chemistry between the two leads.  Washington and Jolie are explosive together.  When their realtionship grows we feel more empathy towards both characters and we want them to win the game.  I enjoyed Bone Collector for everything that it wanted to be and strived to be.  It does a great job of keeping you guessing at the identity of the killer.  And when you find out who he is and why, you are a little confused.  But when the dust clears, you are just glad that it ended the way it does.  This is a great film and a good suspense thriller.  I'm not sure where the negativity is coming from, but my advice to those people is realy simple. Lighten up people.  Not every film has to have a gritty pretencious feel to it like Bringing Out The Dead.  Some films are actually entertaining and make you feel something more than fatigue when you are watching it.  The Bone Collector may make your heart race a little faster and that is always a good thing.  This is a good, tense movie and if you don't believe me, then go see so for yourself.  Just don't listen to those that say it is garbage.  These are many of the same people that say Citizen Kane is the most exciting film ever made.

The first murder is investigated by the hero of the film(Joile).She understands the importance of not tampering with evidence,she stops a subway training barking out orders like a general to the train conductor.She then puts a dollar near a footprint and that wins over Washington, who notes the importance of not tampering with evidence,and as we can all see that he believes this junior officer is the only police officer in town with a brain in her head. The crux of the problem with the film is that the two heroes of this film,Washington and Jolie,their characters are so infallible,and everyone else is so useless and one dimensional that the movie can't inspire any idea of excitement or originality.Everyone who see this kind of film of late says,I passed this way before.You do feel cheated that this movie costing you eight dollars is no more than a run of the mill TV movie. Joile has a character that is an actor's dream.She can do no wrong.She barks out orders and talks back to everyone.She is the only one who can follow Washington's orders to the tee and supposedly not mess up things.She is tough,honest,smart,brave,and unbelieveable all at once.If the bedridden forensic expert can only rely on a young former fashion model(how was this thrown in the movie?)junior officer and bypass the entire New York City Police Department for help then it is a wonder they don't solve all the crimes in New York City by themselves. Washington is still a top actor,but this film is beneath his dignity,more than one can say.The other actors in the film are fine actors as well,but they aren't given anything to work with.Their characters are cardboard cliches out of a comic book.And they all revolve around Joile's character,everybody says how terrific she is,you're terrific,for what's it's worth,I thought what you did today was terrific,I thought you were terrific,and so on.Jolie's character should have been named Ms. Terrific. The character Joile played was similar to the character played by Ashley Judd in Kiss The Girls,with Morgan Freeman in the lead role(the two films are kind of similar in so some ways) a spunky, tough,brave,backtalking,female who can do what a man can do,only better.Given all the advantages she had then,Angelica Joile did not do a very good job since everyone knows she is the hero of the film,.She like the film,however, is too predictable to believe. The Bone Collector is not exciting,it is not scary.It is filled with unnecessary grisly scences,filled with some horrible writing,and lacks a great deal of logic concerning police work in general and policemen in particular.The worst performances of the film belong to the Puerto Rican forensic expert, .They could have done us all a bigger favor concerning making this movie by starting all over.Next time let Chris Rock be the bedridden forensic expert,and let the OlsonTwins catch the killer.If you want to make a comedy go all the way.

How does it stack up? Well first here's the premise. Paraplegic Forensics Officer Lincoln `Link' Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is asked to help in solving a series of gruesome cases. Where something is always surgically removed and linked back to the turn of the century. Rhyme obviously can't enter the crime scenes and uncover the clues so he enlists in rookie detective Amelia Donaghy (Angelie Jolie) to examine the evidence and bring it back him. The Bone Collector is directed by Phillip Noyce who directed other Hollywood ventures like `The Saint', `Patriot Games', `Sliver'. The story on paper sounds like `Rear Window' meets `Silence of the Lambs' but what we get isn't a moody noir film laced with grueling shocks but a very textbook thriller with mildly grueling overtones. What made `Seven' and Silence of the Lambs' so amazing and shocking was their endings and their look. The Bone Collector has no moody look except for a couple strenuous scenes which I credit to relative new comer Jolie. Its in her performance that I believed we had a movie. She is going to be a draw sooner than Hollywood thinks. Because Hollywood didn't want her in this picture saying she wasn't attractive enough. Do all actresses have to be beautiful to be shocked by gruesome bodeis? The films title flaw has to be the director who doesn't really deliver us into the mind of the madman but except focuses on the strains of a paraplegic policeman. Aren't these kinds of thrillers supposed to see into the villain's mind? Coupled with this failure is a non-shock ending which is so cliched it made me shake my head and yearn to see  `Seven' again. If you are looking to jump and cringe some then see the `Bone Collector' but be sure to watch `Seven' afterwards to get the full effect. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

It was a little too formulaic in terms of good cop/bad cop phenomena, but overall I felt it was a decent cop film that gave some good scares.  However, I do hope that those who saw the film will read the book as well.The addition of Queen Latifah as the nurse's aide to Rhyme was quite a good choice, and Jolie did well as the tough-on-the-surface Amelia.  I wasn't so sure about the casting of Washington as Rhyme, but he did an admirable job with a physically limited part.  I liked O'Neill and McGlone in their portrayals, but thought they were too predictably Bad Cop-esque with Rooker's portrayal of Captain Cheney.

This is another one of those instances and another one of those movies. This movie has nothing new to say or show. Plotting, camerawork, and SFX are workmanlike, but show no flair or energy whatsoever. As far as the gripping storyline I have read about in some other posts, I found myself checking the old watch on more than one occasion.

A man buried beside the train tracks with only his hand sticking out of the ground. His index finger has been stripped of its skin right down to the bone and his wife's wedding band placed on it. The clues to finding the wife are there and Donaghy knows it. Thinking quickly Donaghy gets pictures of all evidence that she believes is important, even going as far as to stop a train travelling through the crime scene. When Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington), NYPD's best forensic scientist and a recent paraplegic, hears of what Donaghy did at the crime scene he makes her a proposition that she can't refuse, as much as she wants to. She is to be Rhyme's eyes and ears on the crime scene while he offers her the tutelage and knowledge that is needed to solve this weird case. You see the murderer in question has gone to difficult lengths to make sure that the forensic team finds out where his next victim is going to be found. Director Phillip Noyce (The Saint, Patriot Games) has given us another winner! Washington gives a powerful performance even though he is a confined to a hospital bed for 99% of his scenes. Jolie blossoms as an actress right before your eyes, destroying any doubt that she is one of the most talented young actresses in the business today.

Then it improves the material. It pares away all but the most necessary details on crime scene procedure and forensics.  Thus unencumbered, the plot is allowed to unfold at a compelling pace.Here's what's up a killer masquerading as a taxi driver is spiriting people away to their doom.  At each crime scene, he leaves forensically significant clues which, if deciphered quickly enough, could bring rescuers in time.  The clues seem designed to draw Rhyme's attention.

Instead, the audience is bombarded with uninteresting character portrayals and blatant sexual inferences.  The director tries desperately to create a dark atmosphere, but instead appears listless. All but a few scenes are filmed at night and the day shots look underdeveloped and underlit, instead of somber.  The filmmaking is clumsy, often appearing unskilled and brazenly inept save for one inventive transition from killer to cops.  I can't help but feel that the actors are capable of so much more than the script and the direction they were given.However, contrary to what many other reviewers have said, Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast in the role of Amelia (I refuse to acknowledge the ethnic last name given to the character in the script); she fits the description almost exactly as it's written in the novel. Denzel Washington is also well cast and brings Lincoln Rhyme to life with equal ingenuity and finesse in an otherwise stale and disappointing adaptation of a great novel.The tacked-on Hollywood ending is a pathetic attempt to tie up all the loose ends and leave the audience feeling warm and fuzzy when that's the last thing we should be feeling.  Save your eight dollars and go to the nearest bookstore and buy the novel; it's much more exciting and far less contrived.

The reviews of this movie were less than spectacular from our local paper, so I was a little scared that she would not live up to the potential set forth by her performances in Playing by Heart and Gia.  Luckily, her, as well as Washington, delivered spectacular performances.

Phillip Noyce (Patriot Games, Clear & Present Danger) has directed Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie in this roller coaster ride of a film adapted by Jeremy Iacone from the novel by Jeffrey Deaver. Washington is Lincoln Rhyme, the guy who wrote the books on forensics. Unfortunately, four years ago he had a work-related accident sentencing him to bed as a quadriplegic. The highest tech equipment available surrounds him enabling him to communicate and be somewhat mobile within his confines.  When a couple is kidnapped, Amelia (Jolie) is the officer at the scene of the crime and ably secures the site gathering excellent clues which point at a serial perpetrator. Rhyme, who is ready to throw in the towel and make the final transition, recognizes Amelia's skill and together they proceed to investigate this series of crimes where the villain cuts the victims to the `bone' as his signature.Noyce has used surround sound to heighten the viewer's participation in this `ride'. There are some gruesome sights here (open wounds, rats feeding on a corpse) so this is not your typical date movie. However, the characters are appealing and the revelation at the climax not readily apparent. Queen Latifah, adding to her fine gallery of supporting parts, is Rhyme's live-in nurse. Luis Guzman portrays a police high tech expert in a departure from his usual roles as criminal low-lifes. If you are in the mood for a well made mystery/thriller, Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie (Jon Voight's real life daughter) will provide the emotion and Noyce the thrills and suspense. Just be prepared to jump out of your seat now and then!

It's a convention in the horror genre that if a woman hears some strange noise on a rainy night, of *course* she is going to go out and investigate it - otherwise the story might not continue.But I'm sorry - a NYPD police officer is NOT going to leave her apartment on a rainy night without her gun. Ain't gonna happen. Someone at the screening I saw yelled out incredulously And you're a *police* officer??!! Audience reaction indicated that for Jeremy Iacone to write the script that way undermines not only Amelia's believability but also the story line.Unfortunately, two much more serious faux paus totally trashed this film for me and although I think the first I could reveal without a spoiler warning, I want to err on the side of caution and say don't read any further until you have seen the film.One Lincoln is a master at forensics - the film is set up that way;it's established he's written the Academy manual on field technique. It's evident that he has amassed a lot of data over the years in forensics and any overlapping fields. If this is the case, it's a major cheat by screenwriter Jeremy Iacone to have Amelia stumble over a historical book of murders in a bookstore - murders that parallel those she and Lincoln have been working on. It would be bad enough if this was just happenstance, but no - after collecting fragments of paper found at crime scenes, Lincoln determines that the face seen is the logo of a publishing company dealing with true crimes.He knows this because he *read* all these books when he was a kid. OK - so Amelia goes to a bookstore, tries to get a book from a top shelf and a number of books fall down. Including one entitled The Bone Collector - a collection of true-life murders.I'm sorry - if we are to believe that Lincoln is the expert that he is, there is NO WAY he would not recognize the details of the murders as being historically based when he first sees them - he would know that history. The man does not forget what he reads.Two I don't care WHAT you do to a medical monitor hooked to someone whether they're a quadriplegic or not - you will not turn that person into a carrot, a zucchini, a squash, a pumpkin, or whatever. It's a MONITOR, not a ventilator, not a pacemaker.We know Lincoln's big fear is being a vegetable. His big fear is not really some wacko who thinks he can turn Lincoln into a vegetable via ranting & raving over his medical monitor.Too bad Jeremy Iacone didn't keep that in mind.

There isn't anything particularly novel about the story but it is well-told and both Washington and Jolie are superb in their roles. Denzel Washington is Lincoln Rhyme, world-famous criminologist who via an unfortunate cave-in while doing a rescue resulted in his being confined to a hospital bed at home. He will never walk again, but has control of at least one finger and everything above the shoulders. So with the help of modern electronics can help solve crimes from his bed.Angelina Jolie is Amelia Donaghy, just an ordinary street cop who has applied for a desk job. In her back story we find out her dad was also a cop, but killed himself. She doesn't want to follow in his footsteps.By a simple stroke of being in the right place, Amelia gets to a new crime scene first, takes the action to stop a train to preserve evidence, gets a homeless kid to go buy a couple of disposable cameras, and properly records the crime scene. Rhyme was so impressed that he insisted she remain on the case, to try to find the killer, who turns out to be a serial killer.This was an early role for Queen Latifah, as Rhyme's at home caregiver Thelma. She of course has gone on to quite a nice career but even here she shines in her character.Overall a good diversion for almost 2 hours and good roles for all involved.SPOILERS The serial killer was recreating the crimes detailed in an early 1900s book The Bone Collector. Shards of evidence at several crime scenes allowed them to piece this together and arrived at the last scene in time to save one victim, a small girl. Meanwhile they figured that Rhyme was the last target, and the murderer was about to kill him when Amelia, who had figured out he was next, came and shot him. He had once been a policeman but Rhyme's expert testimony some years back had resulted in his spending time in prison and his motive was to win the game against Rhyme by committing all the murders then kill Rhyme. He was better than Rhyme, but not better than Amelia.

Angelina Jolie is perfect in the role of the young police officer who has talent and is convinced it may lead her toward the same path as her police father. Micheal Rooker plays the Captain, once Rhyme's understudy and now uncomfortable with living in his shadow. Ed O'Neill and Mike McGlone are add the right tone as the more experienced detectives, and Luiz Guzman shines as the talented forensics scientist who analyzes and assesses the physical clues. The film is fluid and never pauses, and the ensemble cast is a testament to both director and casting agent. Definitely not a film for the kiddies, since there is graphic violence and some images that might even disturb adults. If you are a fan of who-dun-its, this film is for you.

The Bone Collecter may not be the best thriller of the nineties but it definitely is one of them. Partly because of its classic and smart ending and its creative and originally good plot that involves a young female cop who is trying to catch a serial killer, using the help of paraplegic cop Lincholn Rhyme.What I admire most about The Bone Collector is the way in which it is so original. It does not steal ideas from other movies and everything in The Bone Collector is totally original and scary. What The Bone Collector could use though is a little bit of a better ending. In the ending, some of the things that happen appear to be really stupid. But it still has a decent ending despite some of the things that happen in it.The acting in The Bone Collector is good, but not great. Apart from the brilliant performance from Leland Orser. Although he only appears in two scenes, he still does really well.Overall, The Bone Collector does not reach the brilliance of some other 1990's thriller films like Seven, Pulp Fiction and The Sixth Sense.

Teamed with a quadriplegic retired detective who is familiar with the killer, Lincoln (Denzel Washington), Amelia begins a desperate search to find the killer, linked to the paralyzed Lincoln through sound and video equipment, before another person falls victim to the brutal serial killer.An above-average crime thriller, The Bone Collector is a chilling and nicely done film. I saw this movie when I was fairly young (my grandmother had read the novel the film was based upon, decided to rent it, and I was in the room as she watched it), and it really petrified me. The image of that partial finger sticking up out of the gravel pit in the beginning of the film never left my mind, and the movie as a whole creeped me out. Now, years later, I've seen the film a few other times and while it wasn't nearly as scary to me (it's really not a 'scary' film), it is still a very well done crime film that is above most others. The plot is nicely tied together, and while I'm not sure how this compares to the book, the storyline this film is constructed around is nicely done.Angelina Jolie leads the cast with a fairly well-rooted role, and plays it very well. Denzel Washington is like her mentor, and while he has hardly any motion or body language throughout the film, his performance is really great. Queen Latifah plays Washington's caregiver, and I was surprised to see her acting in a serious role - she was good as well. Character development and motivation is a little lacking here (a lot is left unexplained), but I didn't see too much of a problem with this. The direction here is nice as well, lots of gloomy atmosphere, dark sets, and moody camera angles. There are some pretty chilling scenes in this movie as well, all of the unfortunate people who fall in the hands of the killer meet gruesome fates, and some of these scenes were really cringe-worthy and scary. The killer in this movie is menacing, and is presented well throughout until his identity is revealed.Overall, The Bone Collector is a really nicely done, eerie crime thriller that is worth watching. People who enjoy crime movies and/or thrillers will want to check this one out, it's well above-average and is surprisingly chilling. While it may be no Silence of the Lambs, it's still worthy. 8/10.

I read some more negative reviews and then decided to buy the DVD to watch again and learn from it.The second viewing was much more enjoyable than the first viewing. That is very rare with me, but I understood much more what the film was trying to do. I then watched the director's commentary all the way through and was impressed with how much respect the actors had for his intensity and hard work.I learned a lot from the commentary and watched the film again. This time I thoroughly enjoyed what was attempted. The focus was on the people who were trying to catch the serial killer. The insurmountable difficulties that faced them, but the demand for stopping the killings pressed them on. The idea of Jolie falling in love with a quadrapelegic blew my mind. When Denzel studied her problems with her father's death and with a few sentences reduced her to streams of tears, bringing her out of her shell and making her productive...I don't think it is the responsibility of the film to do some creative thing to us. We have to meet it half way many times to get what is inside the package. In one shot there is a camera pullback from the serial killer's murder on a street to the top of a skyscraper penthouse where the detectives are studying the evidence.

In a story about the hunting down of a tiger there's no requirement that we meet a tiger in scene two who turns out - surprise! - to be the same tiger who has secretly been killing people ever since.  Imagine how silly Silence of the Lambs would have looked if the man Starling was tracking had turned out to be her hairdresser, or something of that kind.This failure of tone, culminating in an utterly ridiculous confrontation with a killer who kindly explains his motives to the audience, is the main problem, but many subsidiary problems help make it impossible to take anything seriously.  When Amelia discovers the first body she takes photos of everything on a disposable Kodak camera.  Then we see the photos, and they have a level of resolution you wouldn't believe - at any rate, I didn't believe it.  Lincoln Rhyme and pores over the microscopic forensic evidence in order to make rather fantastic deductions from the presence of, say, petrol, or oyster shell particles - but there is a ruddy great big lead staring them in the face all the time the fact that the killer owns and drives a taxi.  Why doesn't someone try to trace THAT?  But nooo, they'd rather peer at the ground through their magnifying glasses and do the Sherlock Holmes routine These footprints were made by a six-foot red-headed man who smokes a pipe and was born in February.  And when everything is revealed at the end, it just makes no sense.  The killer has been trying to attract Lincoln's attention - yet, quite apart from the fact that he seems to be generally omniscient, he KNOWS that Lincoln was confined to a bed, out of touch with the outside world, and, for some of the time, in a coma.As for tiresome and distasteful ... first of all it needs to be said that none of the emotional keyboard-playing really worked.  Amelia and Lincoln seemed likeable enough people, but we were no reason to believe in ANY feelings they might have felt for each other love, lust, friendship, mutual respect, mild affection - all are unexplained bolts from the blue. And the anti-euthanasia preaching was sickening.  Lincoln's problem (we are told) is that he suffers from a seizure every few days, any one of which could turn him into a vegetable; and, not unreasonably, he would rather die than be a vegetable.  At the end of the film he STILL has this problem. Nothing has changed.  Yet he has mysteriously decided not to kill himself after all.  (Surprise, surprise.)  What makes it more mysterious is that otherwise this is a standard last-case-before-retirement movie.  There's nothing dramatically wrong with a policeman who has just completed his last case before retirement, to retire.  It's what we expect.  But somehow I can't see a mainstream film, certainly not THIS craven film, allowing its central character it say, Well, I've had a good innings, but I HAD decided it was time to die, and so it is.  Bah!  It would be fine if he'd changed his mind for some reason or other, but no reason is given.Apart from this it's hard to analyse the feeling of nastiness that pervades this film.  The comparison with Silence of the Lambs suggests something to me.  Despite its gruesome moments, the earlier film had a warmth that The Bone Collector conspicuously lacks.  Silence of the Lambs felt for its characters.  The Bone Collector couldn't care less.  There's a telling moment when the killer's umpteenth victim turns out to be a small girl everyone gasps in horror and says, Oh, no - he's got a child! - as if it would have been perfectly all right for him to have captured and tortured another adult.

Mr. Ebert had this to say  Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie create characters we really like; there's chemistry when they're together, and they're surrounded by the good energy of supporting players like Queen Latifah, Luis Guzman and Ed O'Neill.Washington plays Lincoln Rhyme, a cop who was paralyzed in the line of duty, and an expert in forensics.  Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is the first on the scene of a gruesome murder. Lincoln is so impressed with her handling of the crime scene; he brings her on the case as an extension of his diminished abilities. From here I pleasantly surprised to see an affection develop between the two. A meeting of minds that transcended physical attraction and impressed me.

He's a cop, and he's in a WHEELCHAIR! was, I guess, the original pitch - an echo back to Ironside, if you will - only Washington evidently vetoed this on the grounds that being quadriplegic wasn't quite disabled enough.Wheelchair-bound cops are ten a penny, he probably told his agent. I want to be bed-ridden, on the verge of merciful euthanasia and only able to communicate with wistful eye-rolling and the occasional dignified grunt. Who needs to be an action hero? I'll win the Oscar through facial expressions alone. His character is Lincoln Rhyme, a genius crime-scene investigator crippled by a falling girder but retained by the police as a consultant due to his encyclopaedic knowledge of all New York's grizzly murders.And when a devious serial killer with a penchant for mutilation and historical copycatting runs amok, rookie cop Angelina Jolie (forensics experience zero) is brought in to act as Rhyme's eyes and ears, before those pesky professional crime scene teams get in there and contaminate the evidence. Meanwhile, much of the New York Police Department ups sticks and relocates to Denzel's bedroom.At this point, all plausibility has officially left the building. Washington smooth-talks Jolie into a little light amateur amputation, along with several other flagrant breaches of forensics protocol. I can't claim to be an expert, but I've seen enough CSI to know that William Petersen et al would not tolerate an uninitiated beat cop zooming in and cutting up their corpses, before they've had time to seal off the area, remove their aviator shades and stare quizzically into the middle distance.Hey ho.Jolie is almost as constricted in her role as Washington is in his, shorn, as she is, of any kind of sexuality. Indeed, she spends most of her time covered up in either clunky body armour or an unflattering blue boiler suit with only those famous bee-stung lips betraying any hint of trademark glamour. Her modest appearance would make sense if the institutionalised sexism storyline (implied by the early quips at Jolie's unsuitability for the case and the barefaced recruitment of Michael Rooker as the brash police captain) was fully thought through, but the director (Phillip Noyce) seems reluctant to make it an issue, so the rest of an impressive male cast (including Ed O'Brien, Mike McGlone and the genius Luis Guizman) are frustratingly underused.Surprisingly, what little empathy there is, comes from Queen Latifah's no-nonsense nursemaid who dabs Washington's brow tenderly and provides pithy asides to the masculine posturing of the police officers.Any Se7en-influenced cleverness accumulated during the intricately planned trail of clues at the murder scenes, is immediately ruined by a shockingly lazy ending, and, though Washington manages a melancholic smile during final fade-out, all dreams of Oscar-winning pathos have been long since banished.5/10 "},{"Title":"Preposterous!","Date":"3 April 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" The Bone Collector is so relentlessly stupid that I felt like screaming. You're expected to believe that Denzel Washington, as a quadriplegic former cop, is the sort of genius that puts Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes to shame; he's read (and apparently memorized) thousands of books, has written twelve, has a vaster-than-encyclopedic knowledge of New York City history, whips opponents at computer chess, and is so superhumanly adept at solving crimes that the NYPD lets him direct an entire serial-killer case from his bedside. Except for jealous captain Michael Rooker (cast because of his own Henry the Serial Killer connections), the guy appears to have the entire police bureaucracy under his command! You're also supposed to believe that doe-eyed, puffy-lipped Angelina Jolie -- whose New York accent fades early in the film -- is a respected street cop with a preternatural crime-fighting talent to rival Washington's own, and that Luis Guzman -- admittedly, always a delight, even in this nonsensical role -- is a brilliant forensic chemist. It's the sort of movie where, when Washington asks for the locations of local asbestos-removal sites, within 30 seconds someone comes up with a map on the computer, complete with two or three red dots that blink on and off and actually go beep-beep-beep! The murders themselves are gruesome, needlessly sadistic, and quite ridiculous in their intricacy and supposed motive.

One thing I appreciated about seven and copycat was that the killer was simply the killer - he wasn't someone we encountered earlier in the film.Much like kiss the girls, where the killer turned out to be one of the homicide detectives, it feels that we need to have a shock ending by revealing that the killer was an unsuspecting character that kept popping up throughout the film; one who we never would have guessed.

Many films these days are written by writers writing about writing. And so it is here.The detective story is a modern invention, invented by Poe and popularized by Conan Doyle's Sherlock. The notion was invented as a specific reaction to Darwin's evolution. People are attracted to the idea that the world is logical and sufficient focus and memory from a human can comprehend it. But Doyle hated Sherlock, hated pandering to the same emotions this movie targets, so he created an equal genius in the evil Moriarty.Some of what Moriarty did was done only for the benefit of Holmes, which opened up whole new possibilities for the genre. The author and reader are engaged in a battle of wits while the detective and master criminal fought a parallel battle of the mind. The possibilities are quite rich while some clues are for the detective and some for the reader. On the other hand sloppy writing often depends on this notion without doing the hard work of creating a real dual puzzle.So much for background. The clever idea in this story is that the clues refer to a detective story -- the fiction of the film mirroring the fiction of the book in the film. The fictional detective in the film is supposed to refer a fictional detective in that book. So, in addition to some rather clever actors, this film gets a running start in having a spine that is richer than say your average Clancy thrash.That is why when this film doesn't deliver, when it is just ordinary, I count it as an extraordinary failure. There is no real puzzle here, no real mental battle of the masters. There is in fact no plain old tension.I recommend that you pass on this. It isn't even an interesting failure.

Be prepared to see investigations like they happen in CSI; many of the deductions used here and in that series are impossible to be thought in real life, so it sadly screams Hollywood in some scenes. Directing is one thing to be appreciated here, as well as the acting; my main problem is with the script full of clichÃ©s and things that are only possible in Hollywood. Also, I found quite lame the excuse for the murder to kill all these people; I was actually expecting to see a big twist in the end, with the murder being someone from the current police team. See this film for pure entertaining and nothing else and you may have a good time.

The investigator, Lincoln Rymhe, was injured seriously when a girder fell on him, leaving him bedridden and suffering from seizures. At the beginning on the movie he is fed up with his condition and simply wants to die.Then a murder is uncovered by a rather perceptive street cop, who picks up some interesting clues. From here it slowing unravels that the serial killer is actually leaving clues for the police to follow, but the police will have to use all of their intelligence to catch them as the killer is rather devious.There are numerous conflicts in this movie, but it is the conflict that makes a movie. There is the main one in chasing the serial killer, but we also have one between Rhyme and the female officer, as Rhyme attempts to harness her natural ability at investigating while she wishes to work with the youth. Then there is the stupid lieutenant that is trying to work the case himself thinking everybody else is incompetent. The killer is quite smart though because the obvious clue that he plants leads the police down a completely different track.In the end, the movie tries to lead us to think that the lieutenant is actually the killer, but it is obvious that he is not. First of all it is clear that the lieutenant does not think through matters clearly and acts on the first piece of evidence that he gets, even though it might lead him the wrong way. That is probably the ploy of the killer, but the problem here is that the killer is purposefully leaving clues while the lieutenant is openly trying to destroy them. This is illogical for the killer to act in this way, unless he has a split personality, which is pretty lame anyway.All in all, this was a pretty good movie. It could have been ended better, but there are a few things in there that are left unsaid which take the most perceptive to pick out.

Though not as ridiculous as the Saw films, The Bone Collector is yet another of these contemporary movies in which it isn't enough for a killer to simply be a homicidal maniac. He must also set up elaborate death scenes in some of the most Gothic old places, and leave clues for the police to keep them interested. This script is preposterous on many, many levels, yet the film is acted and photographed well enough that we don't turn the channel. As long as its over by the kickoff of the NFC Championship game, which luckily it was.The film stars Denzel Washington is a criminal forensics expert who is paralyzed and lives in his bed with a myriad of computer and medical equipment all around him. An accident on a crime scene years ago caused his current situation. But once this current case heats up, his apartment is big enough for an entire investigative team to set up an operations center inside it. The NYPD must have a hell of a disability pension available for someone like him to have such a huge place. He even has his own live-in nurse played by Queen Latifah! Angelia Jolie arrives on the scene as a beat cop(!) who impresses Washinton with her evidence gathering instincts at an early crime scene left by our killer. Washington soon has her off the beat and working as his main person on each fresh crime scene. This killer leaves plenty of victims with cryptic clues nearby. He is trying to tell us something. But what??? Maybe if we piece it all together, we can figure out who he is!!!Well, we the audience would have no chance. The conclusions that Washington comes up with seem to be pulled out of thin air. Or the deep recesses of his encyclopedic mind. There is just no way these clues could be pieced together so quickly by real cops. Jolie helps him out here and there, but she is mostly there to look at. And she was a looker back then! Ever since she hooked up with Brad Pitt, she has looked anorexic. Michael Rooker is on hand as the obvious suspect Capt. Chaney. He is hostile to all the good cops for no logical reason except to make us think he's the killer. And obviously he cannot be since the conclusion could never be so obvious. Why would he as the killer leave clues, and then forbid the only cops who can solve them from working the scene? So obviously we are being set up for someone out of left field to be the killer. Actually this person came from out in the parking lot if we are to use baseball stadium references. Maybe never before has there been a more arbitrary killer. Why did they even let him have a talking killer moment? We don't know anything about the events he's talking about, so why should we care? The acting is generally very good, even from supporting players. The cast is populated with several familiar faces. Their dialog is good enough, and said with conviction. But many scenes don't add up in how they are blocked. How can one woman with little forensic training waltz into a cavernous and dirty old slaughterhouse and locate not only the victim, but also some tiny clues so quickly in all that debris? How can the killer (who also drives a taxi) happen to know exactly where and when the kinds of victims he needs will be so he can conveniently give them the last ride of their lives? Did he wait in front of Union Station for hours until an older man and a little girl walked out alone together? Wouldn't that hold up the taxi line? At least the city looked good in one of the last major films made before 9/11/2001 when its skyline was changed forever. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Angelina Jolie plays the young cop who finds the body and collects the forensic details. Washington's character is so impressed that he makes her secondment a condition of his assistance with the crime. At first she begrudges the idea; she had a nice safe desk-job lined up.But - it's a movie. She quickly gets a taste for the criminally exotic and a bit of a crush upon our hero.We join our dynamic duo as they pursue a series of clues in an attempt to anticipate each subsequent crime and save the victims from very gruesome deaths.This is a pretty formulaic thriller which carries a hint of de-ja-vu because there are so many in the genre. Helicopter flights around night-lit sky-scrapers? No CSI would be complete without them. The ambiance in particular reminds me of 'Silence Of The Lambs'; the murders are about as diabolical, there's a lot of Gothic imagery; even the theme and incidental music sounds like it might have been cloned from the earlier movie. The ending smacks of 'Rear Window'. That said; it's extremely intelligently filmed with some very nice set pieces. The leads give good turns with some excellent support from the likes of Queen Latifah and Luis Guzman. There's a solid sound-effects/incidental music track with plenty of deep, visceral tones.I found the denouement a little confusing. Washington's character accuses the villain of deliberately planting evidence in criminal investigations. The villain insists that isn't so. It is not made clear exactly who is telling the truth, and there was scope for an interesting little twist here that was never taken up. There's a cheesy and not very believable epilogue.When you see how much money is to be made in media and fashion, a good-looking woman like Ms Jolie's character would hardly seek out the uncertainties of a police career when she might otherwise 'not get out of bed for less than Â£10,000'. Anybody know any gorgeous cops? Jolie's just too pretty to be true.This movie would score more highly but that there is so much competition in the crime-thriller genre. Definitely worth a watch - but then most of them are. They remind me of new cars; all very competent but so much alike.

It takes a lot of clichÃ©d ideas but turns them into something original and fresh. A quadriplegic detective helps a cop track down a killer who is leaving clues to the next victim, victims who have been put in situations that will kill them by a certain time. A lot of the murders reminded me a little of Saw, a pipe that will blow steam, cuts all over in rat infested areas. The only difference is the police need to save you before you die instead of you saving yourself. it's creative and disturbing and very entertaining. A lot of very tense moments as people are about to die horrible deaths and the police are close to saving them. It keeps the movie very exciting. However, the film loses a lot of my respect when the ending comes. It's a very clichÃ©d, obvious, boring ending and even more so, a disappointing ending. though who the killer is was a bit of a surprise, why he is doing it and what follows after he admits what he's done is a cop out and frankly, a little stupid. It definitely changed my rating but overall did not ruin the film, just made it not as good as it could have been. The acting is good by Denzel Washington but not better than usual for him, just an average performance (which isn't a bad thing.) Angelina Jolie's performance was better than usual but overall nothing special. The rest of the cast was mediocre at best, no one really stands out.

But even with Denzel Washington leading the way this is so far from what actually happens. This thriller isn't thrilling at all.To start off with, Angelina Jolie's character is used to collect forensic evidence throughout the film, despite being unexperienced, but for serious murder cases you'd think they'd go for an expert rather than use the situation as training. Guided by a paraplegic detective (Denzel) they have to solve a series of murders by someone using the signature described above. Later on in the film it seems that the murderer is copying all of his acts from a book, down to the finest detail for each. With all this build-up I was there hoping it would lead to something that would actually make this film memorable for a good reason.However, the ending is such a massive disappointment, involving someone you only saw once in the film. He reveals his reasons for the murders which all in all makes the vast majority of the rest of the movie utterly utterly pointless. The whole bone collector persona was crap. All it did was link the murders, nothing more. The ending is just pasted on to a fairly dull and unrelated storyline, which is so far from thrilling. The murderer is simply looking for revenge on Denzel, so why does he go through all this extra effort of murdering innocent people when he could simply walk into this guys room and kill him? I've heard people say he wanted to make him suffer, but he's already paralysed and was soon wanting to end his life, so that simply doesn't make sense. He even fails at killing him in the end with the unbelievably predictable scenario in which Jolie saves the day in the nick of time with a gunshot just before Denzel would have been killed.There's much much more but I'm already disappointed that I've gone through the whole ending. It's the only way I can truly explain just why I found it so immensely poor though.Much of this film is either pointless or doesn't make sense. You want a real thriller? See a film like Se7en. Don't see this.

Ed O'Nneil gets away from Peg Bundy and the shoe store to become a serious cop in this one.While the plot seems to dig upon a lot of details, the killer motives seem to be a little strange. This serial killer starts off seeming to have a motive for killing, but then seems to veer off totally randomly choosing victims because they are there and killing a cop just for sport at one point in the film.This is one of the least sexy roles I have seen for Jolie. She is obviously attractive in this movie, but not a real sex symbol. This film gives her a more cerebral edge as her love for Washington's character is presented more as an intelligence driven thing rather than being anything physical. Thank goodness her uniforms fit properly as I hate those movies which exploit a woman playing this kind of character by squeezing them into something they can't even bend over in.While this film is not perfect, there are worse ones.

Denzel Washington was very strong in a difficult performance as Lincoln Rhyme, an NYPD Crime Scene detective who's paralyzed during an investigation and confined to bed. Even paralyzed, he's still immeasurably more competent than the boob who replaced him as head of the CSU (Cheney, played by Michael Rooker) and he gets involved from his bed in investigating a series of brutal and sadistic murders. I was hesitant at first about Angelina Jolie as Amelia Donaghy, the street cop who discovers the first murder scene, and who Rhyme takes under his wing as his protÃ©gÃ©, because he sees something in her suited to forensics. Jolie seemed miscast at first, but then it dawned on me - that's the point. She wanted to work in the Youth Division (which would have been the stereotypical cop role played by an actress like Jolie) but Rhyme sees something in her that no one else sees. Once you realize (pretty quickly) that she's deliberately acting against type, she works brilliantly in the role.In some respects it's a typical whodunit sort of story as Rhyme and Donaghy struggle to put the pieces of the puzzle together, and it's a very good one. When the killer was finally revealed, it took me completely by surprise. I hadn't even suspected. The movie includes a bit of a psychological study of both Rhyme as he deals with his paralysis and Donaghy as she struggles with what she slowly begins to recognize as her calling - one she'd really rather not have.My only quibbles are with one line near the beginning of the movie, when Donaghy is leaving for work and her boyfriend says to her my therapist doesn't think this relationship is working for me. Aside from laughing at the ridiculousness of the line, I wondered throughout the movie why it was even necessary to have the boyfriend included at the start. Then the end of the movie falls into totally unnecessary romanticism. It should have ended with the solving of the murders and with Rhyme realizing that he's still productive in spite of his handicap. Everything in between those two quibbles worked very well, though. 9/10 "},{"Title":"Creepy thriller","Date":"10 July 2008","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Most thrillers about serial killers are dumb and lame-brained with twists and answers that anyone could figure out. So here is a rarity; a thriller with brains, and one that is unpredictable and manages to give a good few thrills. Unfortunately it doesn't live up to its full potential.After an accident on the job left Lincoln Rhyme almost completely paralyzed and living with seizures. Rhyme is not a happy person. Enter a killer whose grisly crime is photographed by a street cop named Amelia (Angelina Jolie) who actually read the textbook he wrote, and together they are trying to solve the killer's puzzles before the next victim dies.The Bone Collector is not your average serial killer movie. Apart from being pretty smart and unpredictable, it doesn't go to formula. This isn't a whodunit (although that question is always at the back of everyone's mind). It's more of a race against time, and it comes in short bursts, and not in one long stretch. It's an effective approach, and director Philip Noyce knows what he's doing; he's done this kind of a movie before.There are two problems with The Bone Collector, and they are big ones stiff characters and lack of depth. First off, the characterization is poor. One can't really blame this on any one factor; the actors don't make the characters likable, the director keeps them at an arm's distance, and the writing leaves everyone underdeveloped. It's hard to care about someone when you don't know (or even like) them. The second problem lies mainly with the director. Philip Noyce uses wide, expansive shots everywhere, and while the shot choices make for a unique experience, it doesn't really suit the material, and it makes the viewer feel detached from the characters and the story. Worse, it makes the film seem like a hollow shell that touches all the bases without having the guts to really get into the story.Still, The Bone Collector works. It's a unique thriller, and one that manages to live up to its genre name. Imperfect, but there's enough good stuff here to warrant a viewing.

Denzel Washington stars as Lincoln Rhyme, a bedridden quadriplegic NYPD forensics detective who rivals Sherlock Holmes with his insights and expertise. When a scrappy but sensitive rookie cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), discovers the mutilated corpse of a millionaire buried in a railway tunnel and stops an Amtrak train from destroying the evidence, Linc knows that he has found the perfect protÃ©gÃ© to help him collar this diabolical murderer.Masquerading as a cabbie to trap his victims, their sadistic quarry challenges them by planting cryptic clues at the scene of each crime. When our heroes aren't trying to outfox him, they exchange verbal barbs and contend with an inept police official, Captain Howard Cheney (Michael Rooker of Jumper), who wants Rhyme off the case and Donaghy back walking a beat.Veteran Australian director Phillip Noyce of Patriot Games and One Tough Cop writer Jeremy Iacone have fashioned a first-rate, white-knuckled police procedural yarn that borrows from the best of the genre. Despite the unsavory subject matter, the filmmakers know how to grip audiences without grossing them out. Ace lenser Dean Semler of Waterworld enhances the paranoia with his agile camera work that plunges us into the dark gritty catacombs of the Big Apple. The urban sprawl of New York City where this homicidal maniac lurks has never appeared more sinister and claustrophobic.The best thing about The Bone Collector is that the heroes seldom get a break. Classic thrillers use nail-biting suspense to heighten the tension. Our heroes must hurdle many obstacles before they can capture the killer. As this cat-and-mouse saga unfolds, our heroic duo take on dimension so that by fadeout we know what make them tick. Initially, Rhyme had resigned himself to a physician assisted suicide. Periodic seizures devastate his crippled body, and he realizes that the next seizure may leave him a vegetable. Rhyme has reason then for a rapid assert. Meantime, Donaghy wrestles with her own demons. She saw her policeman father shoot himself, and her boyfriend is pestering her to quit the force. When Linc tries to boss her around, Amelia refuses to let him intimidate her.Ingenious villains make memorable thrillers. Right up to the heart-stopping finale, the mysterious nemesis keeps our heroes guessing. While Rhyme wracks his brains form the confines of his hospital bed, Amelia serves as his arms and legs, rushing off to rescue the poor victims but rarely arriving in time to save them. Sadly, the only flaw in The Bone Collector is the final showdown between Linc and the serial killer. As usual, the over-confident adversary prefers the sound of his own voice to that of his scalpel rending flesh.A fine ensemble cast, featuring Ed O'Neil as a tough-minded NYPD detective and Queen Latifah as Linc's stalwart nurse, bring a modicum of humor to this grim account of a serial killer at large. Moviegoers that crave whodunits like Silence of the Lambs, Copycat, Seven, and Rear Window will relish The Bone Collector.

I'd previously read Jeffrey Deavers novel, on which the movie is based, and had found it an interesting, tense and page turning book. I was optimistic, it's my own fault, I set myself up for the fall.The story has been tweaked and altered to suit Hollywood as you expect with all novel to big screen adapt ions, but along with the very heavy editing and poor re-writing of sections of the story, they took out the most vital part...the tension and mood. What we are left with is a 'crime by numbers' flick that provokes little emotion or interest. You just know what's going to happen to all of the characters and plot lines throughout the film, a true shame, and you end up not really caring whatever the outcome.Denzels character should have stayed true to the original. He should have been moody, annoying, sarcastic and angry. Giving only glimpses of compassion and humour. He's meant to want out of this world (they do mention this in the film) but he seems as happy as a tellitubby for the most part. His 'brilliant mind' is only used to do a paper jigsaw puzzle of clues, leaving him miles away from the character of the book. The use of camera angles and excessive head shots make you forget that the character is a quadriplegic, so you never get to see if Denzel is playing the part convincingly.Angelina Jolies performance seems to have been sourced directly from an angry spoiled teenager. Snappy and then meek, loud and then quiet, unsure and then confident. It just leaves you quite bored and then frustrated. A crucial character, second only to washingtons portrayal of Rhyme, done with little enthusiasm or apparent commitment to the performance.Queen Latifah. Utterly pointless casting and part as it turns out, What was an almost an essential cameo in the novel, is used for nothing more than more excessive still frames and head shots, as her limited ability shows us her looking on in horror. Oh, and she is an essential cog in unlocking the massive paper jigsaw clues.I wanted to enjoy this movie I really did. But the actors were not on top form for, what is in the most part, their massive ability.The use of 'forensic science' throughout the movie is limp. They pick up a clue, have a bit of scratch and sniff and instantly know where and when it's from. 'On to the next clue crime fighters!'. It's just not believable.The film looks shoddy in so many shots and points of editing. It looks as though it has been made as an afternoon TV movie.

Like its predecessors the country-house murder mysteries of the 1930s and the `hardboiled' private eye stories of the 1940s, the serial killer movie has evolved its own set of rules and conventions. `The Bone Collector' follows the pattern set by its predecessors `The Silence of the Lambs' and `Seven' (or `Se7en' as we are supposed to spell it). A dedicated older cop with an inexperienced but keen younger partner battles against an evil but intellectually brilliant murderer who delights in teasing his adversaries with mind games and deliberate clues.In the real world murder, including serial murder, is not simply an elegant game of chess between killer and detective. Apart from their crimes, the main distinguishing feature of serial killers is their ability to hide evidence from the police. (That, of course, is why they survive to become serial killers; those who do not possess such an ability are generally arrested and imprisoned after their first or second murder). Thus Harold Shipman was able to evade detection for so long because he managed to persuade the world that at least a hundred murders were in fact deaths from natural causes, and a number of other notorious mass-murderers (such as John Christie, Dennis Nilsen and Frederick West) were only caught because bodies were discovered by accident in their homes before the police were even aware that a serial killer was at work. When the police do receive taunting communications (such as the notorious `Yorkshire Ripper' tape) these generally prove to have come from someone other than the killer himself.Serial killer films may bill themselves as `psychological crime thrillers', but they have as little to do with real crime or real psychology as do those old Agatha Christie stories where the detective solves the murder like a crossword puzzle and then in the final scene announces to the assembled house-guests that the culprit is the butler. Cut off from reality and bound by a number of formulaic rules, they need a gimmick which will enable the audience to distinguish one from another. Thus in `The Silence of the Lambs' (well enough made in its way) the gimmick was the fact that one murderer was helping the FBI catch another, and in `Se7en' (overrated, although it had a genuinely shocking ending) the pattern of killing was based on the concept of the seven deadly sins.The gimmick in `The Bone Collector' that it gives us a disabled detective. This is not a new concept after James Stewart's character in `Rear Window' and the `Ironside' TV series, but Denzel Washington's Lincoln Rhyme is more seriously disabled than either of those after being injured in the line of duty. Rhyme is completely paralysed from the neck down, apart from one finger which he uses to spell out messages on a computer. The actual investigatory work is done by his able-bodied colleague Amelia Donaghy (played by Angelina Jolie).The plot, as is normal in films of this type, is a complex one, and the general look of the film is dark and gloomy. Washington and Jolie play their roles reasonably well, but there is none of the `chemistry' (to use an overused word) that existed between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in `The Silence of the Lambs and which helped that film rise above the mundane. The worst thing about the film is that one never gets the impression that one is watching a real-life crime investigation; the whole thing is simply a gruesome intellectual puzzle, concocted for our routine entertainment. And serial killing, even if fictional, should not be something that we find either routine or entertaining. 4/10.  "},{"Title":"Read a good book...

The story is alright. There's a certain element of suspense. And the characters seem entertaining enough. Unfortunately those of us who have actually read the Bone Collector by Jeffery Deaver can't help but be incredibly disappointed. Let me first start off by saying that Jeffery Deaver is a brilliant crime novelist who has developed the two main characters Amelia and Lincoln in a number of novels (The Bone Collector, The Coffin Dancer, The Empty Chair, The Stone Monkey and his latest The Vanished Man). Having read them all, I am every time amazed at his ability to write something so incredibly exciting, detailed, well researched. He is by far one of my favourite authors, which is why it pained me to watch this movie.Why is it that when Hollywood decides to make a script out of a really great book, they change all the things about that book that make it so great. Naturally you can't salvage all aspects, but basic things should remain the same. Like the victims. Like the killer. Like the main characters.BIG SPOILERS AHEAD!BIG SPOILERS about the novel and the movie. First the VICTIMS. The victims in the book are not the same as the victims in the movie. The makers of the movie probably thought there were too many victims in the book so they mixed them up a little and decided to kill a few victims at the same time. Another big difference is the victims don't all die in the book. That's what adds to the suspense. Is someone going to save them or not? It's what keeps you on the edge of your seat. Second the KILLER. Why on earth would you want to change the killer? I just don't get it. By changing the killer you change the motive or in this case take it away all together. Finally, the MAIN CHARACTERS. The last time I checked Lincoln Rhyme wasn't black. Maybe they picked Denzel because he was just really great for the part, but then again... who knows. And his nurse... she's supposed to be a HE named THOM. And as far as Amelia is concerned, why would you want to change her last name from SACHS (in the book) to DONAGHY (in the movie). Let me guess, because when they said Amelia Sachs out loud, it sounded like SEX. Oh no, what a disaster, because people in the movies aren't supposed to have 'funny' names, not like people in real life.I have tried to look at this movie objectively and objectively it's not bad. It's not great but it's not bad either. I have only one advice for you. If you insist on seeing the movie, read the book first or not at all. If you've already read the book, skip the movie alltogether. I wish I had.

They're going to have to run out of themes involving serial murderers pretty soon.  The must be a finite amount of synechdoche in the narrative world.  Let's see.  We've had original stories of serial murderers, in which there was no particular pattern to the killings. More recently we've had killers who committed their crimes in such a way as to form a pentagram on a map, some whose victims resembled their mothers, others who killed people who couldn't answer their riddles, others who imitated not one but half a dozen earlier real serial murderers, a guy who lopped body parts off his victims while trying to fashion a statue of Jesus, ones who killed girls according to their somatotype so they could remove particular portions of skin and make a properly taylored costume out of them, others who challenged the cops with puzzles from Alice in Wonderland. (I think I've missed some.)  This one has something to do with the killer repeating his earlier crimes, leading up to his attempted murder of the criminalist he feels was responsible for his earlier conviction, wrapped around abandoned subways, slaughterhouses, old tunnels -- all dating from the turn of the century.  This killer leaves deliberate clues at each crime scene to tease the police.  His presence is revealed at the end and his connection with the whole business is so tenuous that the bed-ridden Denzel Washington has to remind the audience of who he is.Poor Denzel Washington.  He doesn't always get the best parts, the ones that give him a chance to stretch his instrument, but does he ever get the toothsome costars Julia Roberts, Sandra Bullock, and here Angelina Jolie. She plays it pretty straight -- for Angelina Jolie.  There are no nude scenes and no sex, although she massages Washington's only operative digit while he's unconscious, and does it most lasciviously.  But he doesn't get to DO anything with his costars.  He's just a coinvestigator for Bullock, a convenient friend who sleeps on the living room couch for Julia Roberts, and a paraplegic for Jolie.  Angelina Jolie exudes sex in every movie she makes but she can't seem to help it.  Even here, with no simulated intercourse or nudity, where we hardly notice her bosom, and where her grooming is conservative, we are overwhelmed by those protrubent lips and teddy bear eyes, and this despite the fact that in profile, with her flattish nose, she comes close to being compellingly ugly.  She's a reasonably good actress, at least as good as some who have won Academy Awards.  That may or may not be saying much, but the fact is that she's believable enough here.  And so is the supporting cast.  Ed O'Neill turns out to be likably hulky, even when he's not being an egocentric comic goof.  And what's his name, Ruiz -- what a terrific face -- sporting a glabella the size of a .45 caliber bullet hole between his eyes.  I kind of like him better as a good guy, as he was in movies like Q and A and Traffic.  It's too easy to cast him as an immoral roughneck.  Rooks, too, as the ever-present clicheed higher authority in the police force, who's only function in the movie is to become outraged and cashier the hero and heroine, is reasonably good, though he's pretty clearly a red herring.Well.  I don't know where they're going to go next with this formula. I'm trying to think but am having trouble coming up with anything that doesn't belong in a booby hatch.  Maybe -- I know this is pushing the envelope, but hold on -- maybe a serial killer who knocks off people in a way that somehow is correlated with the number and placement of the word tap in Finnegans Wake.

There was too much emphasis on gore and not enough emphasis on certain aspects of the film like the ideas, etc. so the audience were not able to interpret nor understand certain aspects of the plot.Also, some parts of the plot were not very believable. Like the part towards the ending where Amelie escaped from arrest. I can't believe that the officers were not smart enough to keep an eye on her.Also, I don't believe how evidence could just be left lying around on the desk. It's plain obvious that if you should lose the evidence, you're partly to blame and a Captain isn't supposed to do that at all.Other not-so convincing parts were how some of the victims could not be strong enough to try and smash their way out. Normally, when faced with a crisis, the victim will try his best to escape and not let the killer get to him or even suddenly possess an incredible amount of will and do something that's totally unexpected of him.Another rather weird issue was that the film was made in 1999. So, how come there's a lack of cellphones/handphones, even? It's obvious a lot of people owned cellphones or handphones by 1999, so it was kinda weird how none of the victims owned one and therefore, be able to call for help.A last point was the lack of realism in this movie concerning how the victims were picked. It seems that the killer managed to get his victims, by coincidence and not by selecting the victims. If I'm not wrong, he drove the cab only when he wanted to kill so as to avoid getting caught by the police. Therefore, it was odd how he didn't manage to get injured if say, he had chosen a victim who was stronger than him.The pacing of the movie was all right. It was intense at some points but in other parts, the pacing falls flat.Maybe some of today's film directors should take a lesson from the directors who made great films in the past like Alfred Hitchock that no matter how much money you have, it isn't just the visual aspect that counts. It's the plot that ties everything together and makes the audience believe what they see on the screen. If Psycho was frightening only with the visuals but had a horrible plot, I doubt it'd be one of the best movies around.

I figured that Angelina Jolie would then become the entire focus, and I wasn't sure she could carry this type of movie. But I was mistaken. Yes Denzel was in bed the entire movie, but he had all these cool computer gadgets to help him out, and this way Jolie didn't have to become the focal point of the film, she could still ride shotgun to the amazing acting ability of Denzel.Denzel plays Lincoln Rhymes, a forensics detective who was paralyzed while on a case. For 4 years he has been in bed knowing that at any moment he could have a seizure that would kill him, and he decides to go out on his own terms. But before he can do that, a serial killer is found to be on the loose in New York, and Rhymes is the only one who can stop him. But since he is bed ridden, he needs the eyes and ears of someone else to help him out. Those eyes and ears (and lips) come in the form of Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie). She was supposed to go into the Youth Crime department, but gets chosen to help with forensics because Rhymes feels she has the instincts to do the job right. The killer leaves clues as to who he is, and who the next victim will be. Brutal death after brutal death until the next victim is a cop. This movie felt that same as The General's Daughter. In that movie, you had a murder that had a lot of suspects. When they finally revealed who the killer was, I kept thinking that the way the movie was set up, it could have been anybody, and all they had to do was give the killer a reason. But there was nothing that I could see that would have led me to guess who the actual killer was. It's the same way in The Bone Collector. When the killer was finally revealed, there was just a simple reason given as to why he killed all those people. And there was nothing shown in the film, no clues or anything, that would have led you to figure it out. I haven't figured out if I like this kind of ending. I suppose if there were clues and I had figured it out before the end, I would be complaining about how the movie gave too much away. So either way I'd complain. But besides the quick ending, I thought the rest of the movie was pretty good. Denzel gave yet another great performance. Even from a bed, he has the ability to command the screen and everyone on it. Angelina Jolie was able to hold her own against Denzel and even give some back to him at times. Although it bothered me that for the first hour she mostly just yelled and cried. The supporting cast was just that, it supported the main stars. Queen Latifah, Michael Rooker, and Ed O'Neill stayed in the back, coming out to help Denzel and Angelina when they needed it, but mostly staying out of the way. I liked the brutality of the killings. Nothing glamorized here. I liked the fact that the cops weren't able to save everyone, the director actually let people die instead of making the cops heroes all the time. From one of the commercials to the film, it has been compared to both Silence of the Lambs and Seven. I thought that The Bone Collector wasn't as good as Silence of the Lambs or as brutal and dark as Seven but it was good in its own right. Strong performances from the lead stars and a dark and mysterious script helped make this a good movie to see. The ending I felt was a little too rushed and easy, but it didn't take away from the film. So overall I thought The Bone Collector was an enjoyable movie.

Yes, it's that forgettable.The Bone Collector has Denzel Washington as a quadriplegic forensic investigator. As you do. He's investigating crimes where people get abducted in taxis and murdered. The killer is leaving little clues behind so Denzel has to have a little partner fetch the clues for him - it's fellow Oscar actor Angelina Jolie as crack cop Amelia Donaghy. You see what they're doing here? The buddy-cop element is being subverted as she acts as his eyes and ears in the outside world. Clever isn't it? No, I didn't really think so either. Denzel is Denzel - he's dependable in whatever role he's chucked in at the very least, and he's perfectly believable here - just like all the quadriplegic forensic investigators I know...Jolie is fine enough too as the cop-gal-with-something-to-prove-and-a-slight-attitude-too-original-huh , and the rest do what they're paid to do.It's the fact that this movie has a boring script that makes it so unmemorable. It's a tad stupid and non-believable (mind the plot holes please). The killer, as many have pointed out, is disgustingly obvious (I gave the writer too much credit because I assumed he wouldn't be that lame). There's a whole labored feeling to the script, as the characters march around from location, to location, picking up clues to a puzzle in a banal manner. Boring. It doesn't hang well together and the final resolution - when we're meant to go Oh my! I never suspected X! is just, to borrow some slang, lame. Direction? Bit of dark, bit of murky, bit of derision from me....The Bone Collector isn't mind numbingly awful. That's the problem really - it's not anything. It's not good, it's not that bad.

He plays the role of a quadriplegic perfectly depressed and suicidal at times, focused and brilliant at others.  Angelina Jolie is interesting as tough cop with great forensic skills.  I don't think she is miscast as much as unsure with how her character is motivated and driven; the script points her in a few interesting directions, like the pre-film suicide of her policeman father, but we are not allowed to see much further into her life.  I would have liked to see more of what makes her character tick, but the movie chooses to take a much different path.  Ed O'Neill has fun in a serious role here, but I wish he had more screen time.The script is creepy, presenting a cabbie killer who leaves his victims to die in gruesome, unpleasant ways, leaving clues leading to the next crime he will commit.  Washington must guide Jolie through investigating these crimes from his bed (adding a new twist to the tired buddy-cop movie).  The plot holes, while often apparent and gaping, don't detract much from the overall thrill of watching the movie.  Unfortunately, the ending does.  The unmasking of the cabbie killer is so unsatisfying that it nearly ruins the whole of the film. I'd suggest renting the DVD so you can hear Phillip Noyce's commentary, describing how he would have changed the ending (it would have made the film much more successful).  Jeremy Iacone, clearly a talented (though inexperienced) screenwriter, really should have had some help with the climax.  So we've got 90 minutes of great escapist entertainment, and 30 minutes of dreck (with more plot holes to boot).

Yes, it requires willing suspension of disbelief, a concept I first encountered in a Shakespeare class, but most movies do.  And no, that doesn't mean I compare this film to Shakespeare!Perhaps it is my personal prejudice as a cultural resource historian, but the old clues and reliance on knowledge of details of New York history were fascinating.  WARNING -- MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER -- Yes, the clues were obviously placed, but not obvious.  The research to unlock the information in the clusters was realistic, the interweaving of clues and history, their hidden meaning and the ultimate discovery of the old crime story from which the movie gets its name is nearly ingenious.  I found myself urging Rhyme and Ortiz to recognize oyster shell land fill and nitrate rich cattle-related sites.The unusual, but stellar, casting made the story line more believable and the movie as a whole more interesting.  They portray an NYPD crack investigative team  (not to diminish the wonderfully quirky casting of Queen Latifah who is actually the one that solves the puzzle of the woman's face) the way I would like it to be with members of all flavors working outside the box (but hey, I only know history, not New York).  Actually, I found the continued utilization of Rhyme as a forensic genius, in spite of his paralysis, an astute move rather than fantasy.This has become one of my favorite films, every time I watch it there is something new.  I think to enjoy it one has to appreciate the ways Rhyme finds to defend himself, believe it is possible Amelia has a gut instinct for forensics, to understand there are real people who have the cerebral database Rhyme works from, to go with the movie rather than fight against glitches in reality.The versatile Luis Guzman, great as Ortiz, has been a favorite of mine since True Believer, and Washington and Joile have an onscreen chemistry that imbues the choreography of their characters' talents.I highly recommend this movie to mystery and history buffs.

Of course, by cutting the victims hands off, our heroine would actually be destroying post-mortem evidence but er..we'll gloss over that point. Sensibly, she refuses.Is this some sort of conspiracy been the police and Hollywood ?  Are the police fed up of movies acting as self-help manuals for criminals, so the film-makers have been told to make new storylines as far from accepted police procedure as possible ?  I think that any real detective watching this movie would be in severe danger of dying from a rupture caused by excess laughter.At no point do the investigators seem to do anything other than follow the leads laid down for them by the criminal himself.

Humanly portraying the frustrations of a man unable to come to terms with his disability, Washington's intensity throughout the movie is spellbinding - the scene where he unravels the significance of the evidence from the first crime scene is unmissable.His opposite number in the piece, Angelina Jolie playing Amelia Donaghy, is both determined and stubborn while at the same time vulnerable and uncomfortable with her new role as lead crime scene officer.  I'd love some reasoning about why and how the reviewer who called Mrs Thornton miscast came to that conclusion.Add to this a couple of cracking underplayed performances from  Ed O'Neill Queen Latifah and and some terrific visuals - and I'm not talking grisly murder scenes - I'm talking the cinematic vision and style of director, Phillip Noyce - and what you have is a very entertaining, very intelligent movie.You may be let down by the finale, but then the finales of Se7en and Silence of the Lambs were let downs as well - maybe we just like to see if we can unravel the clues, too and when the killer's caught there's nothing else to work on.And a final admission that this may be your kind of movie if you're interested in the treatment of physical evidence and psychological reasoning behind staged crime scenes - so if you've read Paul Britten then you should see this.If you like this movie you may also likeFallen; Manhunter; Cruising; They all have distinctive styles and excellent lead performances - go rent 'em.

Jolie plays a patrolman (person?) who stumbles on a serial killer's trail when she discovers the body of a rich industrialist buried near an old railway station. The case that blows open is then headed by a genius ex-cop (Denzel Washington) who, following a tragic accident, is now a quadroplegic confined to bed who has lost most of his sensory perception in his body but hasn't lost his bloodhound-sharp knack for cracking the toughest evidence. Washington thinks Jolie should be the primary investigator in this case because her inborn instincts are as sharp as his own, and he therefore can do the investigating through her; it seems like she should be impressed, but this little method is a lot more arrogant and belittling than the film seems to realize. Even Angelina looks a bit peeved to be treated like a token cop. Our serial killer, on the other hand, is leaving his victims' bodies with painfully obvious clues as to when and where his next kill is going to be. This wouldn't be quite so stupid a plot element if the characters didn't act so surprised about the culprit's willingness to divulge, but in all their research they seem to be totally clueless to the fact that this guy is obviously begging to be caught for one reason or another (anyone seen Copycat? Sigourney Weaver points out in that film that serial killers DO want to be caught because it's the only way they can be famous).  Undermining our intelligence is clearly what this film's main purpose is, especially since the identity of the killer is quite obvious from the start of the film. That said, the script offers little in the way of gripping distractions, and director Phillip Noyce's efforts in making everything as `real' and `believable' as possible only makes the possible adventures a hell of a lot more dull. Then it all boils down to the most ridiculous denouement in horror film history that is just too much to be believed.

They do the best they can, but the plot details are so utterly contrived that it is ridiculous.  Why is Jolie (or any police officer, for that matter) sent into underground, deserted crime scenes to investigate, when the killer is obviously still at large?  I am not overly familiar with police work, but this made absolutely no sense to me.  With such a horrific killer at work, why would any officer, female or male, be sent out alone purposely?  Another problem I had with it was the pseudo-romantic relationship that was hinted at...at least that's how I took the later interactions between the main characters.  Must EVERY film with a male and female lead end in the requisite romantic connection?  Is it impossible for them to remain simply respected colleagues and friends?  Maybe I interpreted it incorrectly, but if not...When I see a movie, I want to see originality.  It didn't exist in this film.  4 out of 10.

The filming itself was just fantastic and added a high level of suspense to some scenes.Denzel Washington plays a quadriplegic ex-detective who's been asked by the local police to help solve a case of complicated serial killings.  A young female street cop (Angelina Jolie) catches his eye for having a knack for forensics, so he convinces her to assist him in the case.  Queen Latifah plays his live-in nurse and is superb.  She continues to be one of the most underrated actors around.Everything was well-done in the movie, and it's hard to find any weaknesses.  The ONLY weakness is miscasting of Jolie.  Although she does a fine job, her physique and personality don't match the desired traits of the character.

No bed pans here in Hollywoodland, no sponge baths or bed sores either.  We have the standard inept Police Chief ( how do these brainless guys get promoted when they are even unfit to do a flat footed beat), the brazen sassy female cop who enters dangerous crime scenes alone and does not get dismissed for insubordination and does not call anyone for help EVER and has to buy disposable cameras to photograph the scene of the crime and on and on.

Well I guess that's standard, and yes, good thrillers have had that formula but wait to you hear the bad guy's motive! Also the 'rats' thing, I swear I've seen something like that in another film! Plus the whole 'Forensics' angle, I don't know, do you really think an untrained cop would be the main investigator just because some expert who's retired due to injury thinks so! I really doubt it! Some of the dialogue was bad especially when Jolie's character gives the quadriplegic Denzel grief about his persona when she first meets him! It was a little P.C. and unrealistic, no one in their right mind would character assassinate a dying quadriplegic!On another note, some reviews have totally praised this film, which is cool, everyone's entitled to an opinion! But I don't get this comment! Michael Hollywood stated It seemed that each scene was pulled off with a very low amount of takes since all the actors seemed to know what the others were doing and timed everything just right. I'm sorry, but I don't get it, how could any viewer possibly know how many 'takes' a director took to make a film unless they were there! And how can a film possibly 'seem' like it didn't have that many takes? The only ones I know of are low-budget films like the The Castle (only because it took a week and bit to make) but still I couldn't tell how many 'takes' it had exactly and which scenes had less 'takes' than others, it just looked low-budget! The Bone Collector wasn't low-budget! So therefore Im guessing The Bone Collector had a lot of takes and rehearsals because the actors timing was good, not the other way round!Anyway, this film is pretty bad and it's not due to acting although I think Jolie was miscast! The directing was okay, the script was average- full of cliches and the ending was a let-down! Saying that, Denzel Washington did a fine job in his subsequent role, and Michael Rooker is always good!

GOT A PROBLEM?!  I certainly hope not, because then you'd be unhappy and I hate disapproval. Now for the review THE BONE COLLECTOR isn't actually bad, it just could have been so much better.  Like the book was.  It does feature good acting, stylish directing, and the occasional suspenseful moment.  Angelina Jolie is wonderful and wonderfully sexy, Denzel Washington is usual excellent self.  The premise is very good and it's in the classic race-against-time vein of movies.Now for my gripes  They changed the book WAY too much and I wonder if Jeremy Iacone actually read the book or if he asked for the reader's digest summary from his friend who read the book when it first came out and hardly remembers the story. 1) The writer changed the Unsub's identity.  The killer in the book had a clear motive and acted rationally.  The killer struck a sympathetic chord with me when he was revealed yet managed to be menacing with his victims. In this movie, the killer isn't interesting at all. 2) Jeffrey Deaver used actual forensics in story. The clues were more cleverly concealed and this would require clever forensic work. Towards the climax, Rhyme uses his trace evidence to attempt to surprise the serial killer. Rhyme doesn't try this at all in the movie. 3) The police in the book manage to save more of the victims in the book (of course in the movie, they don't save any!).  This adds to the suspense. Where's the suspense if we know their attempts to rescue the vic will be in vain? 4) Speaking about the vics, the vics have more dimension than in the movie.5) Rooker's counterpart in the book was more of a cocky jerk who was so sure of himself but was still very competent.  In the movie he's a goofball and the book didn't toss around the It's Rooker's Character red herring. 6)The novel actually explained why Rhyme chose Sachs instead of a tranied CS TECH. He needed to be able control his technician as Sachs accuses him, but Rhyme says it's because he needs a fresh and untainted tech.  I vote with Sachs. 7) The novel featured bold dashes of wit.  The movie's humorless. 8) The novel feautures a very tense scene between the Bone Collector and Sachs. 9)When the cops realize the unsub's basing their crimes on a book, it's much more believable.  Their are less plot holes in general. 10) The novel ends with a mind-blowing twist.  The movie ends with some cheesey Yuletide celebration. My final verdict is that if they actually kept with the book, we'd have a much better movie.

Boring and unimaginative.The same goes for the ending which really shows how the writers had only one thing in mind to spook people. Letting some almost unknown character be the antagonist is evidence of a profound lack of narrative ability, and feels stupid, uncalled-for and most of all it effectively kills the only suspense one can hang onto to get through this slow flick who's the killer?I can recommend many other movies than this one, notably Se7en and The Silence of the Lambs, who are players in the same genre (gruesome, spooky detective yarns) but infinitely more interesting and nerve-wracking.

Quite simply, there is also a feel about this film that begs comparison to the key plot element of 70's Raymond Burr television crime series Ironside, sans the gore and overt sadism.    In addition, one has to point to the many interesting avenues for characterization that are opened, but never followed through.

Never for a second could I imagine her as a policewoman, even though I don't fault her acting ability.

But she didn't need too.I had read the book before seeing the movie and found it very well written. It's the type of book that I like. I found that whoever wrote the screenplay picked out the right things to write about. If you do want more into Angelina Jolie's character you have to read the book. With a story as good as it was, I don't see how you can explain every character's background in full detail as some wanted.I think that Angelina Jolie did the most amazing job portraying her part. She was absolutely amazing. I am not a huge Denzel Washington fan, but I found that I really enjoyed his acting as well.I don't see how this movie can be compared to Silence of the Lambs. Not only is Angelina Jolie 10 times the actress that Jodi Foster is, you also don't have to listen to Anthony Hopkins annoying voice and slirping sounds. Granted Silence of the Lambs was a movie that made you jump. But I felt the story line in The Bone Collector was so much more interesting. It was not made to be that kind of movie. It was a thriller/drama/action movie. And I believe it pulled off all three very well.So that is what my opinion is. I feel that if you enjoyed the movie, read the book also. It's very much worth your time.

I personally thought it was some guy who killed people and collected their bones. But it's nothing like that. This movie is very interesting.Something the makers of this movie did that is different from most of the other movies of this type, is putting a woman (Angelina Jolie) to make a cop's performance, and allow me to say, she did a great job.One of things I didn't like about this movie is watching Denzel Washington all the time in the same position, in a bed!! But good actors always make good jobs, and even though he was laying down in a bed all the time, he did a great job (as in all of his movies). Denzel is, no doubt about it, one of the best actors if his era.The idea of making all the murders based on a book is fantastic, and the way Denzel Washington discovers that the killer is leading him (them, the police) to a book is great. It's also a little bit hard to believe that the cops (Jolie) always found a tiny piece of paper in every crime scene.I also think they (the writters) exaggerated a little in some scenes, for example When Washington remembers something about some company (or something like that) of the year 1910 (or something like that) .. What was he? A Human Encyclopedia ?? Oh well, movies are movies..Anyway, this movie is pretty good and really worth watching. I'll give it a 9/10 score.

This cardboard cut-out flick is your typical long, drawn-out game of cat and mouse that culminates with a twisted, implausible motive to an overexaggerated psychopath who has taken way too many pains to leave way to many hints which the experts have figured out way too easy.I have always been a big fan of Denzel Washington. From Glory to Malcom X and especially Devil in a Blue Dress he has never ceased to impress me. He does have some moments as this know-it-all parapalegic, and I understand that the fellow can only move his index finger, but for the most part his character of Lincoln Rhyme lacks depth and interest. Angelina Jolie on the other hand is brilliant as usual. The now-Oscar winner is perfect as the hard-boiled rookie who is (in yet another gross stretch of verisimilitude) picked by Rhyme to work the crime scenes. Queen Latifah is surprisingly tolerable. And why the hell Ed O'Neil was cast is beyond me. He was funny as Al Bundy, but he is so pathetic as an detective that there wasn't even a smile on my face. And you thought he could get no lower than a shoe salesman.The thing that did impress me was the forensics aspect. Having taken two classes in investigation, I noticed how technical the knowledge was in this movie. Most of this comes from the Jeffrey Deaver book from which it is adapted, but Jeremy Iacone also had to know a good bit to script this. Still, when Jolie's character (Amelia Donaghy) moves one of the clues, then sits it back down and photographs it, I had to cringe. I think the French would call that tainted a la O.J.. Ouch. Still, as technically correct as this film was, it was equally improbable.Deaver's book of the same title was lackluster at best, yet far better than the movie. Yet another of Iacone's intolerable offenses were his changes in the plot. For starters, there was no heat in the book between Officer Donaghy and Rhyme. But I suppose your typical Hollywood screenwriter knows that there has to be some sort of sparks flying for the masses to keep interested (as if the grisly images of tortured bodies weren't enough). On top of that,(and this is a spoiler for the movie and the book, so if you have not seen it, skip to the next paragraph) though Iacone decided to add Rhyme's mentioning a desire for euthanasia, he ends the movie with a horridly sappy Yuletide reunion with Rhyme and his estranged sister. However, Deaver ends on a much darker note, leading the reader to believe that Rhyme went through with his plans. A much more credible ending, but we all know how Hollywood has to have that feel-good uplifting BS at the end.With a twisted plot, a less-than-terrifying villain, and one bloody disgusting image after another, this movie is your average run-of-the-mill serial killer flick. Silence of the Lambs and Seven were both brilliant, but I've seen them. Why not scrap this equation for movies and plug in some different numbers. Why? Because serial killers sell, and the average moviegoer is not bright enough to figure out he is watching the same movie with a different cast. Though it is almost worth the watch just to see Jolie's tough chick performance, I would recommend those serious movie fans pass this one up.My verdict Make it a dust collector on the rental shelves.

I remember wanting to see this flick when it came out, but I never got around to it. I honestly don't know what all the criticism is about. I liked the movie a lot.Why? Well, here's a short list.1. Denzel Washington was his usual excellent self, playing the quadriplegic New York forensic investigator. His quiet kind of determination and humor, considering his condition, was really part of the heart and soul of this movie.2. I'm a sucker for most movies that have Angelina Jolie in them. Her character swung between tough as nails and vulnerable, and she made it look very believable. My only beef is her job on the story. More on this later.3. The villain is a brutal, sadistic, macabre, and utterly ruthless bad guy, who is excellent, lacking in only one quality - surprise. More on this later as well.4. Excellent shots of the New York City landscape.The movie has two major downsides, but in my case they were easy to overlook.1. The NYPD has a LOT of Forensic investigators on it's staff. There was never any excuse for sending an untrained patrol officer (like Angelina Jolie) as the first one into every crime scene. Lincoln Rhyme can't do it? Fine. Send one of the other dozen or so forensic teams. Talented or not, possessing great instincts or not, Amelia needed a lot more training before she could be trusted to be the first one on a crime scene, with or without Lincoln's endorsement.2. SPOILER ALERT.  The producers and directors apparently wanted to keep the killer's identity a secret, showing no hint of either his inspiration or motivation behind the crimes (much less the killer's identity) until it's close to the end. That was while they were filming. Then, to promote the movie, they do what? GIVE THE KILLER AN IMPORTANT LINE IN THE TRAILER!! Think back to a sentence that went something like this I gave you so many clues and you still failed!  C'mon, folks! I couldn't be the only one in the whole country who recognized that voice as Lieutenant DeWindt the glider pilot in Saving Private Ryan, or that poor guy from the massage parlor in Se7en. All I had to do was look for Leland Orser (yes, that actor has a name) and bingo! The killer's ID was no longer a surprise.2. Even if I haven't seen those movies, The Bone Collector goes out of it's way to give it away. All of the victim's have surgical cuts in their bodies.. Hmmmmm. How many characters that we know about have a medical background? In this movie the killer was supposed to be a surprise. But it wasn't.Also, a mini-beef. I guess there was some sort of semi-romantic subplot with Amelia and Lincoln, but the scriptwriters thought it would be best to wait until the flick's almost over to introduce it. Why? I dunno. Didn't like that part. I mean, c'mon. If they're gonna pair off, pair off! If not, don't try to make the story more interesting with half-baked love plots.I call it 8/10 for the Bone Collector, an excellent suspense thriller in the tradition of Se7en and Copycat that drops the ball in some very easy places.

Unfortunately, the intensity of the suffering endured by the innocent victims in the film overwhelms what positive feelings the story is trying to generate.  Such is not the case in films with a higher thematic purpose - films, like Schindler's List, which try to shed light on the dark side of human nature for a salutary purpose, - but, in routine thrillers such as this one, the grotesquerie becomes both exploitative and offensive.  And, for an added treat, not only are we subjected to the bloodbath resulting from the serial killer's tortures and murders, but the clinical details of the main character's degenerative neurological condition.Denzel Washington, in a phone-in performance, stars as Lincoln Rhyme (there just has to be some symbolic significance to that name somewhere), a crack homicide investigator who, for the past four years, has been reduced to a bedridden invalid after a freak accident while on a routine investigation.  Subjected to frequent seizures which threaten to reduce him to a vegetative state and seriously contemplating an early exit from this earthly existence, Rhyme discovers new purpose in his life when he begins to hunt down a serial killer with the help of Amelia Donaghy, a rookie cop with a natural eye for crime scene investigation.  Together, they manage to hunt down the crazed killer by following the clues he so ingeniously leaves behind.Probably the most impressive aspect of the film is that Donaghy is portrayed as a reluctant helper, made extremely quesy and disturbed by the human depravity she is forced to witness.  This allows her to function as an effective representative for those of us in the audience who are also being dragged along for the ride.  However, this does not enhance the credibility of the script.  The acquisition and successful unraveling of clues seems highly implausible at times, especially when the turn-of-the-century gothic novel - that it turns out is the inspiration for the killer's crimes - literally drops into Donaghy's waiting hands.  And would the NYPD really allow a woman not trained in crime scene forensics lead the investigations - even with the crack investigator Rhyme at the controls?As Donaghy, Angelina Jolie is woefully inadequate, sustaining an expression of openmouthed insipidness throughout.  Then again, all involved, on both sides of the camera, have little to be proud of in The Bone Collector.

It combines some time honored plot elements with some nuances and twists to provide an effective and intriguing story that has viewers wracking their brains along with the characters to figure out who done it.I was prepared to dislike this film when I rented it because I've increasingly felt that the politically correct crowd in Hollywood has gone overboard lately in their use of films as diversity training for the masses. I was expecting preachy subtext about how the handicapped can be heroes too.   Though that message was inherent in the fact that the hero was a quadriplegic,  I came away feeling that the disability was an essential plot element and was not used for shameless sermonizing.The quadriplegic element was actually an effective novelty in a genre that is often criticized (as was this film) for its lack of originality.  The story's calculating serial killer with a very specific motive was a welcome change from oft used psychopath on the rampage.  So, unlike many who have excoriated this script for lacking freshness, I felt it had a lot of good angles that distinguished it in a genre that has been greatly over plowed. Though a novel murder mystery is as hard to come by as a novel romance, that doesn't mean that such familiar themes can no longer be entertaining.Director Phillip Noyce combines mystery, suspense, and graphic violence and delivers the total package with great impact.  He is extremely effective in his use of the camera to heighten the effect of scenes through extreme close ups, top down shots and interesting perspective shots.  His use of sound is also very compelling as on numerous occasions I found myself startled right out of my seat (having the DTS version of the DVD probably enhanced this effect). The underground sets were fantastic and lent an eerie reality to the historic broken down locations where the crimes were set.The acting by Denzel Washington was first rate.  He is particularly effective in thoughtful, intelligent roles where his character has to think his way through the film while dealing with emotional baggage.  This was a particularly difficult role because he had to deliver the impact of the character without the use of his body, making his facial expressions and voice his only dramatic weapons.  Given these constraints, he did an outstanding job of presenting a dynamic and powerful portrayal.Angelina Jolie has proven once again that she is a serious dramatic talent. She consistently eschews the fluffy girlie roles to take on difficult characters.  She was hard as nails and convincing as the intuitive forensics cop.  It was she who made the chemistry work between Lincoln and Amelia by creating an emotional barrier of spiteful cynicism and then slowly letting it down as Lincoln gained her respect.  She has the range to effectively portray grit and vulnerability in the same character which is no small order.I gave this film a 9/10.  As crime dramas go, it was terrific.  The graphic violence is not for everyone, but if you enjoy a good taut murder mystery, you can't go wrong with this film.

Moreover, there is a slow pacing that drives me to think that what I'm going to see is unmistakably boring. Admittedly, there are sensational morbid scenes that stroke me with, but those highlighted points are incomparable to the film's flaws. In the inevitable climatic moment wherein the audience can now identify the surreptitious &#145;killer', the plot gives a reason to frustrate its audience by simply telling that the killer's main motive is to sophisticatedly emit his malevolence and revenge to our heroic vegetable-in-bed.

The initial scenes were thrillingly gripping and the atmosphere creepily filled with a sense of horror/dread. The viewer's interest is immediately perked and made expectant of a first-class film experience.What is wrong in short with this movie is that the serial killer plot becomes a repetitive series of generally the same sequence of events, with deserts of close-up portrait boredom of the 2 main stars. After the second 'episode', any half-decent brain can deduce what is to happen next.Unfortunately, consistency remains only with the serial-gore episodes. Frankly one dimensional 'comic book' characterisation of even the 2 main hero(ine)s, simplified to 5sec/one-liner side references to their respective histories leaves one looking only to how good-looking the stars are, as a means of empathy for them. The 'co-stars' are generally lost in the background, as they usually have the same mood/expression in every scene.The inability of the movie-telling to engage/involve the viewer to participate in trying to solve the clues leaves anyone who tries bewildered. I doubt even a native New Yorker with a good grasp of his city's history can identify with the 'problem- solving' scenes. Hence, we are left to simply accept the solutions and marvel at the IQ and 'database memory' of the Bone- Collector's mind. Oohh.. we are all in awe of his mental prowess!Even when Washington's medic sidekick joins in the 'puzzle solving', she was earlier shown fiddling with a jigsaw puzzle, hence qualifying her expertise. Canny film-making indeed!As I approached dozing-off point, unnecessarily loud 'bangs' of opening doors occur. Trying to find a reason for the director to choose to cause heart failure among the audience, I can only conclude that these may be calculated to wake us up from our slumber.When the culprit is finally revealed, one is not hit by the realisation of who the killer is, but rather by The Killer is... Who? Here, the movie tries to get out of jail by having the baddie ramble on in a classic pulp film-noir spill-the-beans in the end scene. No 'Sixth Sense' confluence of clues for the audience to enjoy here. More so, a resigned acceptance of Ooh so he has a grudge... ooh and then Git on with the gore by the viewer.The technical professionalism with which the movie is prepared is expected of any mainstream Hollywood production. So the ability of the script, direction and editing makes a really good movie stand out from any run-of-the-mill technically competent one. The Bone-Collector is firmly in the latter camp.I dare say that if you swap ANY of the actors with any equally competent one (and there are many in Hollywood), the script/plot and direction will render them in the same one-dimensional 'pulp fiction' characterisation as seen here. I can't see how such characters can provide a platform for any actor (the acting here doesn't require the likes of Denzel Washington to excel too much) to win an Oscar.The profusion of close-up scenes a-la 60 Minutes means Washington's character as a paraplegic is of little consequence. He might as well be fit and healthy, dressed in a feathered cape and sitting at Gotham City's hi-tech Police HQ, directing Jolie's model-cop star character and not need to put in any more acting effort.For me 8/10 for looks, 5/10 as a movie.

In fact, the script doesnt do much to work on the development of Jolie`s character (her problems with the fact that her father commited suicide etc).The film had a small dark feeling to it, or so director Noyce wanted it to be.

First lets talk about the acting... I was only slightly impressed by Angelina's attempt at a new york accent. Other than that, I thought it was a less than stellar performance on all fronts. Come on, Dezel what the heck were you thinking? Hmm, maybe he thought he had already payed his dues making movies where he actually had to walk, and felt he owed it to himself to take it easy on this one. I felt he over acted throughout the whole picture. And that has got to be hard to do when you are stuck in a bed the entire time. Angelina was so skinny it was uncomfortable to watch. Aside from that, the whole melodramatic feel to the movie took away from it's coolness. It just seemed that the relationship between Denzel and Angie was forced and fake and totally romanticized, forcing it into something it wasn't at all. And what was the whole relationship thing they tried to throw in there? Complete nonsense. Then the killer.

I mean, I almost died laughing.  See this movie with a crowd, and you will laugh too.  I was not shocked by the move and could spot every single inspiration.Plot  Copycat meets video games.  The movie has a shut-in parapelegic ex-dectective pulled into another case of somebody imitating old murders.  (Sound familiar?)  Then he controls a young dectective by head sets.  (RPG video games).  Tired, and mundane.  Luckily, this movie was free, or else I would have kicked somebody.  However, I do have to give it to the writer, he seems to be overly kept up in current events.  He has a man who is just out of jail for manipulating evidence (as seen in 60 minutes) and takes on the Kevorkian issue.  Why are these sensitive topics in such a trashy movie?Acting  Jolie was good.  I kind of liked everybody else, but Jolie, O'Niell, and Orser, all do very good jobs.  They create the effect of a movie that is extremely bad, but doesn't quite know it. Inspirations  Well, they stole the plot from Copycat, and made it into an RPG.  Then they decided to add scenes from specific movies.  Although sewer lines blowing up from the street have been in several different movies, the most similar was Ghostbusters.  They took the idea for the book from Seven, by saying that this would be the last murder.  There is the typical everything else.  Another inspiration Graveyard Shift with rats and even the shooting of them.Presentation  **** SPOILER SECTION SPOILERS LACED THROUGHOUT THE SECTION  SKIP DOWN TO THE FINALE ****  Once again, gypped from the gore.

I wish they laced the movie with more gore.  We needed more gore and violence to keep the interest up.  The sex appeal was there (Jolie), but we do not get to see anything.  This is a disappointment, but I can live with it, I guess.  Everything else is hokey, and overdone.  Although I did not realize who the killer was, I knew who it wasn't, and that was the chief.  We all know that the person whom they try to make fairly obvious is the killer, isn't.  They should have given us more clues to who was the killer.  How were we supposed to know that Orser had something against Washington?  Finale  Overall this was one of the most unbelievable movies this year.  I also laughed so hard I split a gut and cried.  I was in tears.  However, most of it was from the audience reaction.  I was laughing at them rather than the movie.  If you want to semi-enjoy this movie see it with a big crowd, especially with easily-scared people.  However, I cannot recommend this movie to anybody.  It sucked beyond normal standards of suckiness.  But, it made me laugh-----------3 "},{"Title":"Lots of ideas cooking, but overall film is half-baked...","Date":"7 January 2003","Score":"4 out of 10 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":" Thriller involving a bed-ridden ex-homicide detective in NYC, still on the police payroll, heading up tense investigation into serial killings involving a psychotic cabbie. Overly-familiar movie material, adapted from Jeffery Deaver's book, has a fatal case of Silence of the Lambs-itis. Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie (as a rookie policewoman) do decent work in underwritten roles, however Ed O'Neill and Queen Latifah are both excellent in colorful supporting parts. Not a sterling example of the genre, yet director Phillip Noyce does everything he can to make it exciting, and cinematographer Dean Semler gets some intriguing shots of the Big Apple. Semler also does well highlighting Jolie's 1000-watt smile--what a beauty this one is! ** from **** "},{"Title":"Keep out!","Date":"21 December 2002","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  I watched this movie in the theater and right from the start of it I felt the movie is underestimating in the viewers intelligence. The movie is about a professional detective which is hurt and now helping a beginner to follow the steps of a serial killer which is ramping in the city. The pro detecive is disabled and using a computer to look at the crime scene. The acting is bad and the directing is awful.The movie was slow and repeated itself which made it boring, reminding me of the movie Seven (which wasn't my taste also). I stopped going to cinemas for 4 months after I watched this movie.Buttom line, don't watch this movie if you are looking for good movies that give you inspirations.

Otherwise this can be described as no more than an empty thriller which is a pale shadow of what it could have been.  After watching the film, the only thought I had was why didn't I watch something else. The who-dunnit in the end was totally inappropriate and the killers motive was even worse.  My advice is to stay away from this and watch a better film of the same genre like What Lies Beneath. Overall I'd give The Bone Collector 4.9 out of 10.

Everyone else in this movie is either to stupied to solve this case involving the bone collector.  Except Denzel and I think its the country star Judd.  What happens is the crime lab and a room of detectives should be fired for gross incompetents and Denzels can grab historical information and answer for clues as if he's psychic, and I think ashly judd ( I could be wrong) can go into a room with no training and find clues as if she is robo cop.  The ending is so predictable you can guess how this one comes out.

I really, REALLY like movies about hyper-intelligent serial killers, but this... The Bone Collector is one of those movies that don't feature a single person with anything resembling a brain. These guys are SO stupid, you want to jump into your TV set to give them a good smack for being such INCREDIBLE idiots. Well, maybe if the movie was exciting and entertaining and kept me guessing about the killer's identity, I could overlook the fact that the characters are dumber than your average smurf, but IT'S IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO GUESS THE KILLER'S IDENTITY DURING THE FIRST 20 MINUTES !!! Really. You start watching this mess and somewhere around minute 15 or so you think to yourself Huh, I think it's ... and it really is who you think it is ! The film makers didn't even try to give the audience some other subjects... ah, forget it. Bloody awful movie, just skip it... and if you happen to meet Phillip Noyce on the street, please, kick his lazy butt for being responsible for this headache-inducing awful mess and not having made a good movie since Dead Calm.

Basically there is an accident in a train tunnel, and Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is the one who found and photographed the scene of the crime, and it seems paralysed forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is the only man who may be able to crack the case. Even though he can only move his head and one finger, and has help from his loving carer/nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah), he is still perfectly capable of accessing most information and evidence on his computer. As he is confronted with more clues from a serial killer, he is drawn away from his thought of assisted suicide, it re-invokes his interest in life. He needs Amelia to go around crime scenes, i.e. be his eyes, ears and legs, but her squeamish nature is slowing them down, best seen in the scene where she refuses to cut a woman's hands off. Towards the end, Amelia finds a book, The Bone Collector that seems to have reference to the crimes the killer has committed, and Richard Thompson (Alien Resurrection's Leland Orser) is the man who comes out of the shadow to reveal himself as the killer. Also starring Michael Rooker as Captain Howard Cheney, Mike McGlone as Detective Kenny Solomon, Luis GuzmÃ¡n as Eddie Ortiz, John Benjamin Hickey as Dr. Barry Lehman and Ed O'Neill as Detective Paulie Sellitto. There are some small disturbing moments with the crime scenes, and the acting is quite gripping, but I personally don't think I'd see it more than once. Worth watching!

What have you got ? Not muchRemember those cop shows from the late 60s/early 70s . They seemed to be having a contest with who can come up with the biggest gimmick . CANNON had a big fat guy as the hero while COLUMBO had the gimmick of a wee scruffy guy in a raincoat . Perhaps the best gimmick was IRONSIDE which featured a cop who did nothing except sit in a wheelchair . Well THE BONE COLLECTOR goes one better , we have a hero detective who stays in bed all day . How`s that for an action thriller ? A hero detective who does nothing except lie in bedThat`s the gimmick but other things like making a newbie cop a woman and having inventive deaths aren`t gimmicks - They`re cliches , and I must say if it wasn`t for the unintentional laughs of watching people tortured to death the gore would have been off putting not to mention unoriginal since we`ve seen the same only done better in SEVEN . There is a truly skin crawling moment involving the bad guy`s hand but apart from that I`ve seen this type of story far too often which means I won`t be putting THE BONE COLLECTOR in my DVD collection   "},{"Title":"Material unworthy of actors in run-of-the-mill serial killer flick","Date":"2 February 2000","Score":"6 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","Review":"  The most surprising thing about The Bone Collector is not the identity of the titular serial killer (the answer to that question is as ridiculous as they come) but rather the appearance of Denzel Washington as the paralyzed hero.  That an actor as good as he would take on dime-store pulp that barely registers as third-rate Silence of the Lambs leads one to believe that despite the challenge of playing a quadriplegic, a substantial paycheck might have had a hand in the decision-making process.  It couldn't have been the material, which is littered with every illogical, implausible, impossible and unforgivable suspense-thriller cliche that has ever offended at the multiplex.  Angelina Jolie, who looks like anything but a beat cop (as if anticipating our skepticism, the movie breathlessly explains that she was a child model before she answered the call of law enforcement), acts well enough to assuage our substantial doubts.  But her verisimilitude is too little, too late as the ordinary plot chugs along its predictable path until depositing the wearied audience at the foot of a howlingly awful conclusion.

In the tradition of such films as SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS comes this utterly uninspired, needlessly sadistic, fare.  Denzel is bedridden through the entire film and Angelina Jolie is woefully miscast.  Poorly written, cardboard thin stock characters just add to the we've seen this all before deja vu experience this film offers.  While director Phillip Noyce has a few camera tricks up his sleeve (mostly used in the service of jolting the audience rather than creating true suspense), the film manages to be uninvolving and uninteresting despite the large amounts of requisite nastiness.
