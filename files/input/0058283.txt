[{"Title":"Savage little gem, among the most arrant balls-out shockers of the sixties","Date":"26 October 2003","Score":"47 out of 57 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" The presence of big-name Hollywood stars does not guise the fact that this is one of the most flagrant mainstream movies of the 1960s. Surprisingly professional treatment is applied to the very sordid thrills at hand, most notably in the leads' performances which range from entirely believable to wonderfully unrestrained. Exceptional, also, is the film's score which erupts occasionally into a semi-experimental, wild beat-jazz type of noise(particularly effective in punctuating the cool opening credits, an interesting Saul Bass-inspired merging of film and frozen shots with linear animation). I can only imagine how some viewers must have reacted to this at the time it was released...a grimy urban nightmare with implied taboo sex, doped-up punks, and some highly disconcerting graphic violence and cruelty for the time. Many of the most cherished leading ladies of Old Hollywood's glory days turned up in very lurid lo-budge vehicles during the 60s, and LIAC would be exemplary of that trend for its inclusion of DeHavilland and Sothern. Both actresses are in top-form here, and their professionalism veils somewhat the meretricious nature of the material(DeHavilland an urbane, mollycoddling mother sidelined by an injury who becomes trapped between floors in her home elevator, and Sothern a wearied but soft-hearted cyprian/burglar taking sheepish advantage of DeHavilland's perdition). Making a memorably heady debut is James Caan(channeling Brando), in his joyously immoderate portrayal of a sociopathic and frighteningly cunning young criminal who strikes terror into the heart of helpless DeHavilland. As he gradually comes to understand this woman's patrician, maternal nature, a very personal and pitiable hostility ignites within him. She is the embodiment of all the love and nurture he's been denied throughout his tragic life, and this becomes his chance to settle the score.Classic must-see stuff for fans of singular 1960s B films within a vague realm which might include WHO KILLED TEDDY BEAR, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE, THE NAKED KISS, and BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING.8/10 "},{"Title":"Sharply observed details elevate this lurid shocker.","Date":"14 July 2005","Score":"39 out of 45 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" Lady In A Cage was far ahead of its time. Compared to the rest of the lurid shockers produced in the early 1960s featuring aging Hollywood stars (including de Havilland's other 1964 appearance in Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte) this film, along with What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? transcended the genre. But while Baby Jane had a lot to say about the price of fame, Lady In A Cage rightly predicted the impending chaos of a rapidly changing society.Nothing about the basic premise (a middle-aged woman trapped in her house is terrorized by vagrants and thugs) suggests a deep sociological study. What elevates the ensuing events are the sharply observed details the neighborhood in transition, the alienated masses isolated by endless traffic, the hoodlums' utter lack of conscience, and most of all, de Havilland's expert performance as the lone representative of the civilized world. Her undoing serves as a cautionary tale for a society on the brink. de Havilland makes this otherwise unsavory film exceedingly watchable. As her secrets are uncovered, she finds herself culpable as well. Everyone is caught in the inexorable downward spiral.Despite the heavy themes, the film is highly accessible, even fun, if you take a jaundiced view. Not quite as campy as Baby Jane perhaps, but on some level, just as iconic. It's a film that stands up well to repeated viewings. Great graphic title sequence, modern music, sharp- focus black and white photography. Overall, fine work by everyone involved.

Meanwhile, a dangerous gang of punks leaded by Randall (James Caan) invades the house and decides to eliminate all the witness after the robbery.I have never heard any reference about Lady in a Cage, but I decided to buy the just-released DVD and I do not regret. I found a tense, unpleasant, claustrophobic, sadistic and scary urban tale, with outstanding and impressive performance of James Caan. The story shows the lack of attention and sympathy of the urban populations, the violence of criminals against their victims and it is very ahead of time for a 1964 movie. I recalled the also claustrophobic and excellent 1955 The Desperate Hours, but Lady in a Cage is more realistic, frightening and brutal, and has not aged.

Joan went on to star in further classics such as BERSERK and STRAIT-JACKET. Davis opted to choose more classier roles in films such as THE NANNY and DEAD RINGER. Both Davis and De Havilland starred together in HUSH HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE which was coincidentally released the same year as LADY IN A CAGE.Why these talented Oscar-winning actresses chose to start this genre of now known 'camp-classics' will never be fully understood.In this strange film, De Havilland plays a wealthy widow residing in a mansion in Los Angeles. She has a problem with her legs so an elevator has been installed by the staircase as an alternative for her traveling between floors.She also lives with her son, now a young man. She is hell-bent on having him marry a pretty young lady as all mothers wish for their sons, but her son is different. There are suggested tones in the film that he is perhaps gay, but he leaves the film at an early stage and we are only given this hint later on when she finds a suicide note left by him.When her son leaves the home, De Havilland finds herself trapped inside the elevator after an electrical circuit blows, leaving her suspended between the two floors, hence the title of the movie, LADY IN A CAGE.In another strange casting role, Ann Sothern plays a cat burglar who chooses to burgle De Havilland's home. Upon discovering her trapped in the elevator, she lets the word out to fellow crooks, including James Caan in his first film role. He and two other bandits decide to rob the mansion. And this is when the film gets rather ugly.Released at such a 'restricted' time in the 60's for films with violent under-tones, this movie was originally banned in my home country of Australia. It was not until the 70's when it was actually released there, and after watching this movie, you can see why. There are definite early tones of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in this movie.Without giving too much away, several scenes depict graphic violence including a gouged eye socket, Ann Sothern getting peppered with bullets and extreme themes of brutality and misogyny as De Havilland is taunted and shamed in her stage of entrapment. Sensing her terror and frustration as De Havilland can do nothing but watch as she is held imprisoned by her tormenters, you can't help but think of Joan Crawford's portrayal of this same character in WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? Both actresses play the role superbly.Filmed entirely in black and white, this will certainly leave a bad taste in your mouth afterwards. While this movie shouldn't be written off as being 'in bad taste and disgusting', it does achieve it's intended goal a great deal of SUSPENSE. You will find yourself gazing at the ringing telephone as De Havilland tries her best attempts to answer it. You will find yourself sweating bullets as De Havilland drags her own body across the floor as she claws her way to freedom.And yes, you will wonder what influenced the woman who once played Melanie in GONE WITH THE WIND to star in a film like this.Overall, Olivia De Havilland gets my thumbs up for starring in this ground-breaking and generally misunderstood classic. The opening credits/title sequence is a real winner too.10/10  "},{"Title":"A terrific, edge-of-your seat thriller with excellent performances.","Date":"24 February 2001","Score":"17 out of 17 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":"  Released back in the mid-'60's, this sadly overlooked thriller was way ahead of its time and foreshadows the senseless violence that exists in our society today.

A power failure is responsible for her predicament.  Three thugs (which includes James Caan as lead thug  !) take advantage of the situation and terrorize the crap out this helpless woman (or is she helpless????????).In my opinion, this film still packs a helluva wallop today despite its age. It has its brutality at points both physically and psychologically.   The ending is very violent and still leaves me stunned (my hair is standing up as I write this just thinking about it again).  There is one line uttered by James Caan in this movie which had to be considered so offensive back then (about the old lady's son), I still consider it pretty low yet strangely classic as part of the film.As of this writing, this film comes on AMC once in a blue moon.

Her gradual descent into insanity as she is trapped in her cage is chilling to watch. She goes from being an uptight fakey Joan Crawford, through to neurotic terrified Shelly Winters (her scene where she rolls her eyes around in horror is CLASSIC), until ultimately she is a crazed Bette Davis...I loved the shot of the dead dog, and the cars whizzing by, not noticing the alarm bell ringing endlessly. The fact that the whole thing happens in daylight was a good touch. What made this film good is that I didn't know how it was going to end - it seemed just nasty enough to go all out with an amoral ending if it felt like it. No wonder if was banned in the UK when it first came out. The inevitable comparisons to Whatever Happened to Baby Jane should be made. In some ways this is a superior film - Baby Jane always appeared a little slow and plodding, and should have been cut by about 30 minutes. Lady in A Cage is just long enough, and it kept me gripped throughout.Forget whether or not this film is philosophy 101. It's a camp classic - and Olivia's naff poetry and observations about cities being jungles are all part of the fun. Just sit back and enjoy it. As for James Caan - he makes a wonderful debut, which owes a LOT to Brando and Dean. He appears shirtless for a good deal of the movie, and I don't think I've ever seen a pair of tighter jeans on anyone, before or since. He's the icing that makes this movie a very fine cake.

After her son Malcolm has left for the weekend, an accident outside knocks out the power as she is going upstairs in the elevator. Though she hits an outside alarm, no one who can help hears it. The only ones that hear it? Any thief within a 5-mile radius. A homeless alcoholic (Jeff Corey) is first on the scene; he steals a toaster and alerts a cheap hustler, Sade (Ann Sothern, who resembles Suzanne Pleshette in this film). However, they're no match for the next bunch, played by James Caan, Jennifer Billingsley, and Rafael Campos, who seem like early Mansonites and decide everything is theirs. (Later a third group shows up, and they're the toughest yet.) All the while, the lady of the house sits in the elevator, powerless to do anything about the destruction around her.This is a harrowing movie, very '60s in its music and the messages are familiar the urban jungle, druggies, man's inhumanity to man, people not stopping to help, putting themselves and their own agendas first. The de Havilland character is driven to drastic measures - the movie will glue you to your TV set.The beautiful de Havilland is excellent - as she always is - as the trapped woman who not only has to deal with enemies at the gate but the fact that one of the crooks finds an accusatory note from her son which ends with a suicide threat - and she has no idea there was a problem. He sounds gay, one of them (Campos) says. James Caan is appropriately frightening, and so hairy it looks as if hair was taped onto his body. Jennifer Billingsley is good as his whacked out, drug-laden girlfriend. Sothern's story has a big continuity hole; it's never resolved. It's always a treat to see her in anything, and she plays this down and out loser very well.Without de Havilland, this would have been a fairly lousy movie; with her, I think it's a cut above the horror films of other aging, classic film actresses like Crawford and Davis. If there is one thing de Havilland can always bring to a role besides great acting - and I write in the present tense because she's still alive - it's refinement, beauty, and class. Let's hope there's still a role she will agree to play.

Lady in a Cage is something of a bizarre film in that it looks and feels like an art house movie, but it's actually a really sleazy little film that takes in all the worst aspects of society. Lady in a Cage is really well put together, as there's only one idea in the film and most of it takes place in a single location. This idea is made to work by way of the characters and the way in which the situation is set up. The story follows an older woman who has had a private lift installed after breaking her hip. When her son goes away, there is a power cut and she ends up trapped in the lift. After using the alarm bell to call for help, her call is answered; but this becomes the start of her problems when the people that heed the call turn out to be a troupe of looters! The thing that makes this film so frightening is that all the violence and intimidation takes place in the central character's home; and it all happens in front of her, as she can see and hear from her prison - but can't do anything about it!Lady in a Cage benefits from a plethora of great performances. Olivia de Havilland look a little too young to have a thirty year old son, but she is excellent at portraying the anxiety of the title character. Havilland's lead role garners a lot of sympathy and really makes the film work. The lead villain sees James Caan in an early role, and he delivers the sort of powerhouse portrayal that would lead to great acclaim in The Godfather. The rest of the support cast is good, with Ann Sothern and Jeff Corey standing out the most for me, as the slightly nicer pair of villains. Walter Grauman's direction is superb, as he allows the audience to take in the scene at all times and small, but vigilant uses of the camera ensure that the central situation comes across in a way that ensures it is as frightening as possible. The central situation is one of those that really allow the audience to think, as it's easy to put yourself in the situation of any one of the leads, and the intelligent script gives this film a believable and interesting way of playing out. For some reason, Lady in a Cage isn't one of the better known thrillers of its type, but if you're a fan of films such as Suddenly Last Summer, Wait Until Dark or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane - this film is highly recommended!

Imagine a particularly raw Rod Serling double-feature and you'll probably come close; but this isn't television.I've been watching some late sixties movies recently, and I've been surprised at how plot-less they all seem - people simply doing whatever they feel like, for good or ill, with no judgment from the filmmaker or the story as to their actions - and very often with no ending at all, simply an idea that this was just a slice of existence.This is just such a film an existential, nihilist slice of time. There's no attempt to explain the actions of the protagonists; they're just there, and the results are brutal and disturbing. It also has a slightly stagey feel to it, which makes me wonder if it wasn't an adapted play; and the black-and-white stock definitely helps to bottle the atmosphere. There is an ending, and it's nasty too. No Hollywood pink ribbons here.If you like your films on the strange side, and don't mind them raw (and believe me, this one still is after nearly 50 years) give it a look.

Hush, Sweet Charlotte, altering her career from the predominantly tasteful and refined roles she had played up to that time. Here she plays a smothering, nauseatingly erudite and cultured woman who, after a hip operation, has to rely on an in-house elevator to get her from one floor to another of her antique-filled home. Her son (Swan), a closeted homosexual, leaves ostensibly for the Fourth of July weekend and inadvertently upsets the power in their house, causing de Havilland to become trapped between floors in her cage. Corey, a somewhat helpless wino, responds to her emergency alarm when no one else does, but he proceeds to rip off her toaster and some other things, including wine. He enlists flouncy Sothern, a small-time prostitute and con-woman, to help him loot the place, but unfortunately he draws the attention of three local hoods who decide to take over for themselves. Caan, a tough punk, Billingsley, his pot-smoking girlfriend and Campos, their dim-witted pal make up this set of rebels without pause. These six characters battle it out amongst themselves until they're either freed, apprehended or dead. The film opens with some faux (but effective) Saul Bass credits, illustrating the cold, careless world that waits outside de Havilland's gilded home. (Prophetically, Sothern's name appears on the grate of a vintage automobile, presaging her voice-over work on the legendary debacle My Mother the Car a year later!) The entire film is more an exercise in (heavy-handed) allegory than a plausible storyline with de Havilland experiencing severe distress while everything around her goes on normally. The contrivance of her plight and the lack of plausibility in the story are thankfully overcome by the intensity and the arresting nature of the situation. The opening sequences between de Havilland and her son are hilariously bad but it only takes 12 minutes for her to wind up a dozen feet off her marble floor and from then on, the plot manages to keep a fairly firm grip on the audience. Even then, she creates unintentional laughter as she recites idiotic poetry, fiddles with a hand-held radio and mutters inane comments to herself while grasping the rails of her elevator doors. (And don't miss the scene beforehand where she, literally, glares at her air conditioning unit, demanding that it kick back on after faltering briefly!) Still, despite some ridiculous overacting and high-minded mouthing, de Havilland comes through, as the picture progresses, as a gritty heroine to root for. She wins the audience over with her self-realizations and her determination. Caan is a hunky (and very hairy!) thug with a very dangerous edge. It's fascinating to watch these two very different performers interact - he at the very start of his career and she coming to the end of hers. He is clearly embracing a Method type of approach (which is the only thing that can explain the way he wears his white shirt in the second half!) while she is all technique. Billingsley does not present a very captivating portrayal here and her career was decidedly dismal compared to Caan's. Campos is effectively offbeat. Corey (an almost legendary acting teacher) hams it up pretty much and sports some heavy eye makeup, but does a decent job. Adding much flavor and fun to the film is porky, but still very pretty Sothern. Eschewing virtually all of her pride and vanity, she plays a sloth-like, self-effacing slut with almost no compunctions, yet she somehow is able to come across sympathetically at times! Occasionally written off as sleaze or camp, the film definitely has it's moments of both, but also serves as a reminder that not all bad things happen at night or far away. Sometimes death and crime are happening right next door in broad daylight. It's influence can clearly be seen in many subsequent films including A Clockwork Orange and Death Wish. The memorable ending is a real eye-opener even now in this seen-it-all age.

On one unfortunate day, her son leaves for a few days(there is a sad angle to his life that we see in little increments as mother does little overbearing things which etch subtly on William Swan's Malcolm's face), and during an accidental power failure, Cornelia is trapped in her elevator and her alarm bell doesn't seem to attract anyone for assistance. Her constant bell ringing does bring one visitor, unfortunate for Cornelia it is a wino played by Jeff Corey who seeks a relationship with Ann Sothern's(who is very good)Sade, a hustler. The wino escapes Cornelia's home with a toaster for a quick sell at a pawn shop where the sadistic pack of wolves led by an evil James Caan(who is simply brilliant in an inspired method performance)as Randall Simpson O'Connell notice him. They see possible riches so they follow the wino(who has enlisted the aid of Sade)to Cornelia's home. From this point on, we must watch in horror as Cornelia dangles in this contraption while Caan and his gang terrorize Sade and the wino while mocking her..and taking her possessions from the house. They decide to it might be wise to kill the wino and Sade, not to mention ending the life of Cornelia. Cornelia, however, has tricks up her sleeve. Seeing Caan harassing de Havilland I feel is the most powerful part of this film..that and the unfortunate tragedy of Cornelia's son who can not accept his mother's overbearing waysthere is also perhaps hints of incest which might even broaden the the tragedy of the entire film. The film has us in an unpleasant position..we are on-lookers to a poor woman's fate for she has nowhere to go and is almost at the mercy of heathens who have this nihilism that is unpleasant. The film itself is so uncompromising I found myself surprised at how early it was made. 1964(or perhaps even 1960)was perhaps an example of how films would begin to leave the normalcy and comfort of feeding audiences only happy subjects and endings when the world was anything but. Caan and his bunch are a representation of the youth culture abandoned by society..perhaps that's why the rage and hostility towards the older sect comes from. Caan's Randall informs Cornelia he's been in reform schools and institutions since he was 9. One can perhaps see why he's so willing to smash and maim..there's such pain there that can only surface through volatile means. Cornelia is a victim not only of health and age, but because of her wealth. That wealth only fuels Randall's will. The film, I believe, is a masterwork that was way before it's time. It has not aged at all.

She tries to ring her emergency bell, but it goes unanswered for a matter of minutes, later on to be acknowledged by a disheveled wino, who later disconnects the bell (he has the word REPENT either stamped or tattooed on his hands) in torn clothes (this being played by Jeff Corey). The phone rings shortly later on, but Mrs. Hilliard is unsuccessful in answering it. She tries again later and finally gets it pleading for help, but finds out that it is disconnected while trying to make a call. A few minutes pass by and the wino breaks into the house looking for some booze, and finds some. Mrs. Hilliard mistakenly assumes that the person in the house is a friend of hers, but finds out it isn't. The guy ends up stealing her toaster and her watch, while breaking some of her porcelain figurines by throwing them against the wall and screaming Repent! (while Mrs. Hilliard screams Help! repeatedly before he leaves) and he goes over to see his female friend, Sade (played by Ann Sothern). He starts to tell her about the house and the woman in the elevator and convinces her to go see it. But, within a few minutes, things go downhill even further, as the three thugs (two men and a young blonde) barge into the house creating havoc. They take clothes, they take a bath upstairs, and also take some of Mrs. Hilliard's stuff (the young blonde ends up wearing her dress, and chanting We're going to have a party. There isn't a great deal of shocking moments in my opinion, but, there are two or three that I can think of. One is where the young thug, Randall (James Caan's character) ends up talking odd talk to Mrs. Hilliard and openly belching to her face (talk about bad manners) and tries to shake the elevator. Another scene is where the wino ends up being stabbed to death in Mrs. Hilliard's presence (she doesn't see the poor man being stabbed, as he is hidden by a folding panel, but you can see the look of horror on her face as she witnesses the sadistic killing). Another one is where Randall climbs into the elevator and intimidates Mrs. Hilliard. Randall obviously discovers a note that Mrs. Hilliard's son had written before he left. The note's details are quite odd and a real shock, because her son tells her something about that if she won't let him live a life of his own, he will kill himself, and that there is a safe somewhere; her son also tells her to give him his half of the money or he will do as quoted (Randall is also demanding to know from Mrs. Hilliard where the safe is located in the house). The real shocking scene is in the end of the movie where Mrs. Hilliard crawls like a snake to the door and outside her house trying to flag down someone to help her. Earlier, she managed to use her hand to manually flip the switch that controls the elevator's door and to jump out of the elevator head first. Randall goes after her and drags her back in the house; she then continues pleading for help, to which he mocks her, there is also an exchange of saying Damn you, and Randall gets stabbed in the eyes with the metal trim from the elevator!!! Ouch!!! He obviously loses his sight and gets killed shortly later on by having his head smashed by a passing car's tires. She then gets help from authorities, and ends up attracting attention to herself while screaming Murderers! or Neandertals! or something else to the thugs (who get caught almost immediately after trying to escape. I first saw this movie on TV one night back in the '90s (I assume in '94 or '95) on AMC, and thought it was funny. This is a movie that will give you a mild scare when you see it for the first time. This would have also been a great Hitchcock movie, if he had directed it.

It has a good dash of campy humor. Note the grotesque procession of roach-like, seemingly driverless cars streaming incessantly past a residential street that should be nice and quiet.

Some people say it is horror,but it is not. This is a film about cruelty of modern civilization,where people mostly do not care of others and everyone watches his own business.Lady in a Cage is a story about modern society from a psycho-sociological point of view. This is not an action movie and you can not aspect too much from it.You just have to let it be what it is.This is everyday story of ordinary people with all their greed,selfishness and their personnel background. Mrs.Hilyard is possessive mother but not a dictator, she just does not know when enough is enough.She is helpless and probably wishes unconsciously his son to stay with her despite she is telling him to get married.He is desperate and just wants to be free,and obviously ready to do anything even if it means threatening to kill himself like he wrote in letter. Randall (played by James Caan) is a typical trash of society but his family and society made him be what he is. There is a conversation between Mrs.Hilyard and him when she says to him that ordinary tax-payers like herself pay money so that state can feed people like him in prisons. Those two are opposites-she represents everything that he hates. She reminds him on his grandmother who used to control him when he was kid. He says about his grandmother while putting a knife to Mrs.Hilyards neck-I would kill her,if she did not die. There is another difference between them-Mrs.Hilyard is rich and Randall is poor and that intensifies his hatred about her, so he wants to steel as more as he can from her house. But he loses all of that when Mr.Pauls men arrive and grab everything and we see him beaten by them. There is always someone stronger and tougher-the Law of the Jungle. Elaine and Essie are just Randalls puppets.They do everything he tells them and sometimes enjoy in doing so,even when they kill George, a scum who arrived there first. They also wanted to kill Sade a whore who came with George and Mrs.Hilyard to leave no witness, but they failed. They payed price of their greed and as they said there is a hot chair in this state for them. Story comes to an end when Mrs.Hilyard stabs Randall in his eyes and he gets blinded,soon he gets killed by a car on the street-the most shocking scene in all of the movie.People finally find Mrs.Hilyard after she released herself from cage like elevator and when everything is over as usual.We do not know what happened to her son-movie leaves us wondering did he kill himself or not? It is on us to make our own conclusions. But what is the point of this movie that some viewers understood very well and some misunderstood completely? This is our materialistic society and civilization with all of its destructiveness. Like in Erich From book The anatomy of human destructiveness, as more technologically advanced is,civilization is more destructive. There is a scene in movie when Mrs.Hilyard thinks that someone pushed the button and dropped the bomb. She thinks on nuclear war of which people were afraid back in that time (just remember Cuban- missile crisis in 1962). In modern society lots of people are alienated despite of their success and wealth (Mrs.Hilyard is mostly alone),others are pushed on the edge as nus products (Randall and his gang,George,Sade and others) and there is high crime rate as a result of that. I am afraid of how it is going to be in a future when it was like that in past and the same (if not worse) is now. Is it going to get worse or better? Nobody hears Mrs.Hilyard ringing for help endlessly,everyone went on vacation.Nobody cares. Attention of people is attracted only on the end when they face the horror (blinded Randall on the street gets killed by a car and Mrs.Hilyard yelling for help). But when everything is over,endless line of vehicles proceeds further. People who were interrupted for a moment go to their direction,life goes on,civilization keeps functioning like nothing happened. Just another day in a big city. The point of this movie is contained in Mrs.Hilyards words-We taught that we defeated jungle by building our modern cities, but we just made it a new foundations. Just like in Guns n Roses song-Welcome to the Jungle.

A major studio release that spares no one. It contains nary a single redeeming character, and views people and society as indifferent, greedy, and animalistic. Even the lady of the title is seen as selfish and the cause of her son's unhappiness. Directed by television veteran Walter Grauman, the film pulls few punches, makes effective use of the set and exteriors, and beginning with the title sequence, it's grim, and compelling. Olvia deHaviland who appeared in Hush,Hush Sweet Charlotte the same year is well-cast.

It is interesting that it was made in 1964, and that many other reviewers also have noted it was ahead of its time, and reflecting the downward spiral of middle American values and society.Olivia DeHavilland excels as a sheltered bird in a gilded cage. Her life has been protected; insulated; nothing bad can ever happen to her because she has money. Right? (rhetorical question).James Caan also was not a personal favorite, but he is realistic and menacing as an ex-con; out to get what he wants, when he wants. Some disturbing scenes are with Anne Sothern, a drunken victim, and an elderly homeless man, hauntingly portrayed by Charles Seeley. They are the first victims.The sub-plot with DeHavilland and her son, who apparently is suicidal, is not completely developed, but is also disturbing. What is wrong with our society today, that such things can happen? Also the not in my neighborhood mentality is explored- she is in a wealthy neighborhood- where such things do not happen (How many times has one tuned in to see local news; people saying this would never happen in their neighborhood!). The fact is, it can, and does. It is the people in the neighborhood, and their issues, which are brought to the forefront. People have problems whether they live in South Miami or Beverly Hills.Overall an excellent commentary on society and its failures. One should also read Joyce Carol Oates' novels, Zombie, Rape, a Love Story or American Appetites. All represent aspects of suburban life in America as it is, not how it is perceived to be.

This is a cruel and nasty film and many will take offence at it, but it is not without merit. The opening credits are excellent, setting the scene well for the brutality which is to follow. All the characters we meet in the film are without morals and have no respect or compassion for anyone else. Stealing, terrorising, beating, murder and abuse is part of everyday life for these people. The performances throughout are excellent and thoroughly convincing although the characters portrayed are repellent. Jennifer Billingsley and Rafael Campos are frighteningly realistic as drugged up and dysfunctional teens with James Cann excelling as their psycho leader. He exudes a bold and magnetic but threatening sexuality and is only half dressed for most of the film. His eventual fate and his compatriots reaction to it are truly shocking. Jeff Corey and Ann Sothern are also outstanding in their roles as older, but just as irresponsible, members of the same breed. One major problem with the narrative is the unexplained fate of the Ann Sothern character, apparently the scene of her eventual murder was filmed but not used. This is probably a blessing as it would have increased the intensity of the film to an unbearable level and would have been very hard to take. As it is, it takes some will power to sit through the abuse and murder of Jeff Corey's drunk. This is a difficult and challenging film to watch but it is powerful and suspenseful and deserves to be seen.

Not only does she have to perform for most of the film from a lift cage, but has to contend with a purple script, and participate in scenes of violence and degradation entirely alien to her screen persona to date.This is a film angry and ugly in equal measure. Jet planes fly overhead unconcernedly as Mrs Hilyard is tormented, just as cars have already driven past blind to the dead dog laying outside her house. A young black girl runs her skates up the injured legs of a fallen drunk. Women are either helpless (Hilyard), nympho druggies (Elaine) or faded whores (Sade). Men are drunks (Brady), mummy's boys (Malcom) or worse. It is a world full of indifference to the plight of others, of strangers who are casually cruel, of heat, claustrophobia and malice. Mrs Hilyard herself does not deserve her ordeal, but her snobbery (and self satisfied addiction to appalling verse, principally of her own composition) and expressed distate for the offal of the welfare state is hardly attractive. Clearly Grauman intends her predicament to be an allegory both of her personal and social isolation as Hilyard's experience occurs amidst an ominous backdrop of current events (at one point she thinks the bomb has dropped). Now and again the world intrudes through a broadcast or passing plane which places the action in a larger context. This of course is lost on Mrs Hilyard. She is just as much out of touch with with society at large as with her son's emotions. Ultimately her captivity by the Randall gang is merely a physical realisation of what, morally, has long been the case. There's a shot which emphasises this the masked Randall, Elaine and Essie stare fixedly at Mrs Hilyard over the banisters. The camera pans over from their silent and still faces to the victim's, then over to the window through which the sun appears as a burning globe. Their presence it seems is a permanent, and as harshly pervasive as elements of nature.This was Caan's debut, and his is quite a presence, stalking panther-like, around the looted home. His sadism and shallow greed, and complete lack of redeeming features, make the greatest impact in a film which is full of such gestures. When burping his contempt for his captive, Caan expresses in a few uncouth noises (I *am* an animal he proudly confesses at one point) more than much of the other speechifying put together. The ironic equivalent of Hilyard's poetry, his grunts sum him up as neatly as Mrs Hilyard's affected and dated poeticism does her. Paul Glass' score is a standout and makes for a stunning opening titles sequence. Its discordance and violence reflecting exactly the film's aggressive, alienated tone - one which, as has been noted by other viewers, anticipates that of 'Clockwork Orange' a few years later. Interestingly during the titles the director's credit appears on a conditioning unit, as if he intends his work to let some fresh air in on the foulness he will uncover. Whether or not he succeeds is up to the viewer to decide, but it doesn't make for an easy ride, and one banned in Finland and Australia. Interestingly his next film was the much more restrained and conservative '633 Squadron' until after a couple more obscure films he retreated back to TV.

Imagine yourself being trapped in a too small cage, day in day out, and helplessly having to observe everything that happens around you. They could constantly live in fear for all we know. Any movie that subconsciously forces you to contemplate about such a matter has got to be at least a bit remarkable, and this Lady in a Cage is indeed one of the most perplexing (yet still sadly underrated) movies of the entire 60's decade. Olivia De Havilland portrays &#150; marvelously, I may add &#150; the wealthy poetess Cornelia Hilyard who gets trapped in her home elevator whilst her only son is out celebrating the 4th of July weekend. She desperately rings the device's emergency alarm, but this noise only lures people with bad intentions towards her house. Whilst stuck several feet above the ground, a drunken and homeless religion freak, his greedy prostitute compliance and a trio of youthful but very sadistic thugs successively invade Mrs. Hilyard's home. The concept of the film sounds very simplistic, but it's much more than just a routine and sleazy thriller. The atmosphere is enormously disturbing, the overall tone as well as the on screen brutality and depicted violence are far ahead of their time (1964, remember?) and several well-scripted sub plots and detailed character drawings make the film far more complex than it superficially appears. The perpetrators aren't your ordinary petty thieves but deeply disturbed human beings and the harrowing relationship between Mrs. Hilyard and her son (which is too unique to reveal here) actually even deserved a whole separate screenplay on its own. Director Walter Grauman also succeeds in creating a twisted & severely depressing world perspective here. Mrs. Hilyard's house lies next to a very busy road, where cars are jammed in traffic continuously and people undoubtedly hear the alarm bell, but no one bothers to check whether his/help is required. All these aspects suggest that Lady in a Cage is a cinematic study in sociology as much as it is a claustrophobic thriller, but &#150; be advised &#150; it primarily is a strong & uncompromising chiller, and the squeamish and/or people with a sensitive nerve system might have difficulties with it. Olivia de Havilland's performance is truly absorbing, as said, but she's definitely not the only acting highlight of the film. James Caan delivers what unquestionably has to be one of the strongest big screen debuts ever as the genuinely petrifying leader of the delinquents. Perhaps not ideal for all tastes & likings, but if you do decide to watch Lady in a Cage, it will become one of those film experiences that haunt and scare you forever.

Too bad the network's commercials are so idiotic, frequent, and noisy.2. Someone here writes, Why would Olivia de Havilland accept a role like this? Well, because she was an actor. Actors want to act. Female actors in their 40s and 50s don't get offered many roles.3. James Caan is splendidly hammy. What a beautiful young man he was, but he was also amazingly stiff and armored in the shoulders and chest, and therein resided the source for many of his future problems with substance abuse (or so would opine Wilhelm Reich).4. Jeff Corey plays George Brady, the vagrant dude, nicknamed Repent. (Does the Repent tattoo on his hand owe a debt to the tats on Robert Mitchum in The Night of the Hunter?) Corey was one of the great character actors of his generation (see also his work in Butch Cassidy, etc. etc.). He was also a distinguished teacher of acting, maybe the best-respected such teacher in Hollywood in the '60s and '70s. Among his students Jack Nicholson, Barbra Streisand, Robin Williams. 5. There's something about a nylon pulled over the face that's just flat-out scary on a primal level.6. Early in the film there's some pot-smoking going on in a car. This is by no means the first pot ever smoked in a movie but I'm wondering if it's maybe the first explicit, obvious case of pot smoking in a movie since the 1940s. There's an interesting list at Wikipedia called List of Films Containing Frequent Marijuana Use that supplies a bit of background - there was apparently a gap in pot use in movies between the '40s and the '60s. (Lady in a Cage doesn't qualify for the list because its pot scene is brief.) 7. The sequence at the end, where cars drive by and no one pays attention, seems to have been inspired by the Kitty Genovese murder case, which transpired in '64 and shocked the nation, and quickly interested Hollywood (Perry Mason had a Genovese-inspired case in '65).

It caught my eye on Amazon and I thought it sounded like the greatest film ever. I have never heard anything about it but I figure if it attracted Ms. De Havilland, it have some merit, right? I was so titallated by the set-up that I had no doubt in my mind that this was going to be the best film ever. I was right! The film begins with a darling little setup of a 30 year old man, Malcolm, living with his kind but overbearing mother. He is going away for the 4th of July weekend, leaving behind a suicide note for her to find when he is already gone. It is clear that they have a strange relationship as he jarringly refers to her as darling (shudder!!). Soon after he leaves, due to a power cut, Mrs. Hillyard find herself trapped in an elevator they had installed since she broke her hip the year before. Hot and panicked, Mrs. Hillyard tries to free herself but soon finds she may be safer where she is when a string of nogoodniks break into her house with trouble in mind.I don't want to give away too much about the plot but the reason I found this film to be so charming is the role of the villain. It starts out as a harmless, crazy homeless man accompanied by a down-on-her-luck ageing prostitute stealing silver to pawn but they soon become victims themselves when they are joined but three dangerous teenage delinquents. Later in the film, Mrs. Hillyard's own conscience places her as the villain, at least in her own mind. She sees herself as a monster, which in some ways she is, bringing the circle of villainry to almost a perfect circle.The people around her are so busy getting away for 4th of July weekend that they fail to notice her strife despite her use of a fairly effective alarm a number of times. A shot, during the opening credits of a dead dog lying by the road, ignored by passers-by is gory and distressing and foreshadows a later scene in which Mrs. Hillyard tries to get help out on the busy road outside her house.The relationship that is built between Mrs. Hillyard and the ringleader of the delinquents (a very young, very intense James Caan) is interesting, particularly an exchange between the two in which she begs him to show mercy on her as she is a living breathing human being, to which he replies that he is an animal. This is how the film ensues. He is an animal. He is a frightening, menacing character and the moral and physical content is quite shocking for a film from the 1960s.Now, it should be noted that this is exploitation cinema. It is not your typical Olivia De Havilland affair. It is low-brow, it is visceral and it is full of (effective) shock tactics. Admirably gory for such an early film, Lady in a Cage delivers a string of unexpected twists and turns and never fails to deliver horror and melodrama in equal measure. Olivia De Havilland is a class act as usual, and the chemistry between her and James Caan illustrates the enormous generation gap that existed in the early sixties and highlights the running theme throughout the film which was integral in most of these fear-mongering, moral high ground films about juvenile delinquents; fear of the future.This is a film that (at least for me) has everything. It has a classy leading lady, a truly frightening villain, a high-concept setup and a charmingly exploitative accusatory tone, rampant on the early sixties, regarding young juvenile deinquency. Highly recommended and you can pick it up here for the stupidly cheap price of £1.50. Enjoy!

This mother of all mothers, grasping and clinging in spite of her genuine love for her son Malcolm, has driven him out of her house with her determination to hang onto him. She has been in an accident which created the necessity for an elevator to be put into their upper middle class neighborhood home. Malcolm has left her a letter asking for his share of the estate and pretty much releasing him from her life. She is to give him her answer at a certain time when he calls, but unfortunately, fate is against her, with a power outage leaving her trapped in her elevator as a group of juvenile delinquents invade her home and terrorizing her.An old hooker named Sadie (played by veteran Ann Sothern in one of her great performances) also invades with a pawn broker, and the terrified de Havilland is not only forced to watch her valuables be stolen one by one but be psychologically tortured when one of the thugs (a young James Caan) reads the letter to her, making her sound just as monstrous as the thugs invading her privacy. This horror drama is a metaphor for the way society turned after World War II with neighbors basically beginning to not be so neighborly and an antipathy towards humanity taking over the world where nobody seemed to care anymore about anybody but their own. With chilling music, eerie photography and a modern sensibility that still resonates today, Lady in a Cage is unforgettable.Even if several moments become truly camp in the way in which they are presented, the fact is still there that in recent history, humanity has become very inhuman, that we pass each other by without a thought outside our own existences, and that we've left the basic rules of Love thy neighbor behind in church, even if we still go. De Havilland is at times totally over the top as when she talks to the buttons in her precious elevator, asking them Now what the hell's a matter with you? That's Rafael Campos, a veteran Latino actor from The Blackboard Jungle and Trial, as Caan's violent side-kick, and he's unapologetic of making his thug character a total animal without any human feelings. Young Caan briefly does show a more human side as he looks on at De Havilland in horror as to realizing what kind of person she is and perhaps recalling his relationship with his own mother that made him head down wrong paths. So while this film at times can make you laugh at it, there's also a bit of guilt in doing so because such horrors still exist today and show no signs of disappearing.

The script is way, way beneath her.The film starts out okay. A wealthy, older lady needs an in-house elevator as a result of a leg injury. One summer day the lift, with her in it, gets stuck between the first and second floor when the electricity goes off. The woman is trapped. Naturally, she's alone in the big house. Fortunately for the film's plot, cell phones had not yet been invented.Her predicament goes from bad to worse when an old drunk breaks in, to steal some wine. Then, the plot descends into absurdity when a gang of young hoodlums follows the wino to the house. Chaos ensues. The film is a B-grade horror flick, along the lines of Whatever Happened To Baby Jane?Except for the performance of James Caan, acting is highly melodramatic, sometimes laughably so. The wino is hardly more than a cartoon figure. His prostitute friend, played by Ann Sothern, is unnecessary to the plot. The three hoodlums are all shallow and stereotyped. Their mentality is comparable to The Three Stooges.Cinematography is conventional. Background music is whimsical and not in-sync with the story's premise, thus diluting the suspense.Yet, the film does have some value, derived from its theme. For all of the modern inventions and conveniences, individual humans still have brute tendencies, which can surface under the right conditions. At a more general level, modern cities resemble jungles. In Lady In A Cage, the intruders are like selfish barbarians who have breached the security gate, thus forcing humanity back into the stone age.Overall, however, the film's plot is so ridiculous and the performances are so farcical that I cannot take this film seriously.

So Having established in the first minute of screen time that Olivia de Havilland is perfectly able to walk, albeit slowly, with the aid of a walking stick and further established inside another minute - via an exchange of dialogue with her son, about to leave her alone in the house for several days - that she will be able to dispense with the walking stick in just a few weeks, why, we wonder, has she seen fit to install an elevator that would not be out of place in a four-star hotel, in a modest-sized house in which the only stairs on view are straight and number no more than twenty treads at the outside. Why not install a stairlift? Okay, let that one go for a moment; after eleven minutes screen time the power fails leaving her suspended some six or seven feet above the ground. Eventually she presses the alarm button which rings, not, as we might suppose, in the local police station/doctor's surgery etc but in an alley at the side of the house which depends on 1) someone passing by at the exact time the alarm sounds and 2) no noise from traffic on the large highway that runs in front of the house. Okay, let THAT one go, too. When a passing wino (Jeff Corey) stumbles into the kitchen deHavilland, who can't see who it is, launches into what SHE thinks is logical exposition A few months ago she broke her hip and had the elevator installed until it mended. This is where it falls down. To design, build and install such an elevator would take about three times as long as it would for the hip to heal so immediately the whole premise is out the window. When you're thinking this whilst WATCHING the film you know they're in trouble. Having said that it's certainly watchable; deHavilland, clearly anxious to put Melanie Wilks behind her, reveals a backbone (if not a hipbone) and Corey and Ann Sothern turn in fine support. Worth a look.

They call each other darling. She's partially lame and is forced to use an interior elevator as she cannot climb the staircase.  He's about to leave for the weekend with friends, but has left her a note saying he's miserable and going to commit suicide.Well, Olivia thinks she's protected against the nastier parts of the human race behind the walls of her house.

Stone Age, her I come! she cries to herself.I can imagine that this film could seem disturbing to some at the time of it's release - it certainly pushed the envelope in 1964.

It's fueled by the mentality that helped open the flood gates leading to today's nasty approach to Cinema. It galvanized the view of the so-called 'new breed', the likes of Tarantino, Stone, Scorsese, Eastwood, Greenway, etc, more than likely developed their ideas while watching this and others that followed in it's wake...copying a style that was already a copy of something else. From the opening credits we are treated to an almost cheap carbon copy of the design created by Saul Basss for the main titles of Hitchcock's 'Psycho'. Even the introduction to the first scene is lifted out of the same film --camera moves through an open window into a room-- what follows is a difficult to watch story of civilization in decline. Perhaps this could have been a good example, except like today's movie makers this crew seem to be enjoying the sensationalized carnage and almost kill off the message. If it were not for the involvement of some fine talent behind and in front of the cameras, this would be a complete waste of time.It's all a calculated mix from casting to script. First we have new comer James Caan, groomed in true Hollywood fashion as a clone of Marlon Brando who by this time was upgrading his image with more sophisticated roles (I mean how many times can you play the delinquent or pug?) Caan would later do the same thing within that other acclaimed cinematic dirge The Godfather (Yes I know, a fav' of many and I will take flack for this, but really...?) in there with him would also be Marlon, with a mouth full of marbles, mumbling his way through to over-rated raves. So that's how far we progressed?Director Walter Grauman, a TV man, was likely hoping this would see him hailed as the next Hitchcock (who by this time was in decline) but went on to do little better. The Producer/Writer Luther Davis is the big surprise, what was he thinking?. Apart from a few good lines that challenge us to question what we have become and why, he then simply go's on to trundle out a set of vulgar situations that are in keeping with the exploitation cheapies of the 50s. Looking back on his sterling career as scriptwriter The Black Hand '50 (Gene Kelly's fist dramatic role) ~ The Hucksters '47 ~ A Lion is in the Streets '53 etc..this is certainly an odd work. Olivia De Haviland must have genuinely needed work to allow herself to be dragged down to this level. Although, unlike some others I thought she was very convincing in a difficult situation. Ann Southern also turns in a good performance within a generally thankless role. The rest of the cast are alternately interesting and dull, but this is basically because they can't rise above their shoddy, limited characters. Veteran Director of Photography the outstanding Lee Garmes tries hard to keep it looking better than it deserved, but it's a pale shadow to his Scareface '32 ~ Detective Story ''51 ~ Jungle Book '42 ~ Since you went Away '44 ~ Walter Mitty '47 ~ Nightmare Ally '47 Etc... This grimy work was somewhat understandably refused classification in Australia, Britain, Denmark, and I dare say several other countries. It would have been put back in it's box and returned to it's country of origin with a note 'Returning to you - not wanted in our heads'. So, decades later, along comes our now 'enlightened' Aunty ABC and programs it on free to air TV without modifications, good one Aunty! and according to the nightly news, we sure do need this stuff over here nowadays! I've heard it argued that today's movie makers are simply holding up a mirror to ourselves, but more often what we seem to be seeing is the dark reflection of their own inner ugliness. While there are some that think 'Lady in a Cage' is good, others should perhaps beware! One thing that could be said in it's favor is...having being made within the restrictions of it's day, it stands as a good example for today's writers on how to use more imagination to express their point, without simply choking us with over the top course language!KenR.....

When he breaks into the house, he is surprised by the possibilities he finds. Earlier he had been at the pawn shop where the owner had no scruples dealing with hot stuff. George informs a floozy neighbor, Sade, about his good fortune, asking her to come along. Knowing about the situation with the lady of the house, they proceed to rob the place.A trio of misfits observe George and Sade carrying things from the house and they enter the place. Randall, the leader is a sadist. Elaine, who appears to be his girl and Essie, a Latino youth, cannot believe their luck. Randall proceeds to terrorize Cornelia, as well as George and Sade. These criminals have a confrontation with Mrs. Hilyard whose views on their station in life does not endear her to the criminals. The situation will end tragically.Directed by Walter Grauman, a man who made a name for himself working on television, the film feels exactly as though it was a dramatic presentation for that medium. Written by Luther Davis, the film is a curiosity we never saw. It has that 60s look typical of the era. Our main interest was to see James Caan's film debut doing a poor imitation of Marlon Brando down to the trademark tee shirt, emoting his way through the film. Olivia de Havilland goes through all the emotions of a trapped person that has to watch how her home is ransacked by vicious criminals.

The claustrophobic atmosphere is maintained reasonably well, but there is one key element which really spoils the film. The trio of crooks are terribly written. They speak and act in a totally unconvincing way.

Originally her son returns and there is an outdoor still showing him carrying a dazed de Havilland in his arms--but apparently this was changed and his character was dropped, leaving the victimized de Havilland sobbing alone--as does Ann Sothern disappear once she is locked in a closet. Her brutal treatment at the hands of James Caan was cut as it was obviously considered too harrowing for a film already mired in violence. The editing is atrocious. The whole thing emerges as nothing but an obviously cheap exploitation of senseless violence, whether it was ahead of its time or not. Strangely, because the current climate abounds in films that show nothing but violence and gore, this film is now considered tame by today's standards. "},{"Title":"A social thriller that will have you screaming in terror - for the stop button.","Date":"5 January 2007","Score":"7 out of 21 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Horror, Thriller","Review":" This total piece of crap was obviously made by a forerunner of the late 60s left-wing Western protester. This laughable, ludicrous suspense movie is all about making an anti-U.S. hence anti-capitalism statement about the oh-so horrible detachment and isolation that rule the western world, an environment in which people care only about themselves, where no one will help anyone and where things just look damn, damn grim. As opposed to the warm environments of socialist and communist societies in which people never cease smiling and where everybody is always ready to take the last shirt of his back to give to a person in need. Yeah, right...The movie is so idiotic it defies belief. What is even more preposterous that it is rated highly by critics, often described as underrated or overlooked. First of all, the way De Havilland loses electricity is too stupid, even for a 60s movie her son leaves the house, leaving behind a sort-of suicide note, and just as he is unpacking his car he hits some ladders which disable the electric cables. How brilliant! Perhaps brilliant in a simple-minded comic-book or a comedy-of-errors type story - but certainly not here. Then De Havilland rings her alarm on and on and on, but the very very evil capitalist citizens ignore her alarm, for they are too busy amassing riches and property which is all these goddamn no-good capitalist a**holes really care about, ain't it? After a while, a whino enters the house, then his fat woman friend, and then a totally ridiculous trio of hooligans who learned their acting technique in the Freddie Francis School of Mugging and Overacting.There is nothing suspenseful about this movie. It is too silly to be taken seriously, which is the main ingredient for suspense. The social commentary is pathetic, and quite embarrassing. When Caan and de Havilland have an exchange we see the left-wing stereotypes rolling in Havilland - the selfish rich person out of touch with reality, and Caan - the hooligan who turned out so because the evil capitalist society made him so, and so the poor thing turned to violence as his only means out. So touching... *sob*...A film for morons. "}]
