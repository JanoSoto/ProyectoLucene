They have made one of the funniest children's films that you will ever see. You know that they had a great time making it because it's clearly evident on the screen. George of the Jungle is simply just a Tarzan parody. (Ape-man meets girl, falls for girl, leaves for city, returns to jungle). But the predictable plot doesn't destroy the performances and the movie is peppered with some laugh out loud jokes.Of course the special effects are impressive - a talking ape, an elephant that thinks he's a dog - but it's the humans that steal the show. Fraser is fantastic as George - he is one of the most talented actors out there at the moment - though this film doesn't test his range much, he shows a nice comic flair. Mann is a lovable foil for our hero, though her squeaky voice is at times too cute. None of the other characters disappoint. Both Mann's parents are great in supporting roles and Lyle as Mann's nasty fiance is sensational.Kids will love this. Adults, I think will find a lot to enjoy in it also, but don't bring along any cynics. They'll miss out on all the fun!!

We also see an elephant act like a dog and along the way our hero (Brendan Fraser) is a likable boob. Sometimes it's just plain stupid but that's what you get with any comedy. Disney has this in the PG mode so we get some of the standard peeing, farting, sex jokes and innuendos, kicking people in the groin....you know, all those supposedly-hilarious gags that have become so commonplace in modern family comedies.

One of the reasons why the movie is worthwhile is Brendan Fraser's hot body,because in all his career I personally think this is the movie that he is in his best, physically speaking.This movie is a Tarzan's parody, where the baby George,after an airplane accident, gets lost in the Africa (specifically in the jungle) and is raised by apes. 25 years later, he is a beautiful and strong man, and he turned to be the king of the jungle, even being a little clumsy and naive in many times.Ursula and Lyle are the rich couple who are walking in the Africa's jungle where Tarzan lives. They are engaged, but Ursula is not very happy with that decision. (What I personally think is very acceptable, once Lyle is a stupid materialist coward)But when Tarzan saves Ursula and they start to get close,many things are about to change, and Ursula's marriage with Lyle is one of them.Ps funny facts 1-The talking monkey, who is an intellectual with British accent 2- Shep, George's ''dog'',who actually is an elephant.

The original Jay Ward cartoon featured terrible puns, a smarmy narrator, and the dumber-than-driftwood Tarzan-wannabe George.The film version recreats all those elements with surprisingly good results. Fraiser as George gets away with an awful lot of mugging, but he seems so innocent and unaffected that he puts it over.The SPFX are good in a Jumanji kind of way; movielovers with even half an eye open will be able to tell the CGI Shep from his real counterpart and the audioanimatronic Ape named Ape. But the HOW of this movie doesn't detract from the WHY... Cleese makes an effective British APE, and SHEP's scenes are downright hilarious (watch him play fetch!).I also liked the way the movie kept the metahumor aspects of the series--here's a film that is clearly not afraid to make fun of itself. Pages of explanatory dialogue from Ursula, for instance, are dispensed with in speeded-up fashion (a la The Gods Must Be Crazy), complete with chipmunk voice.By the final reel, everything degenerates into poop and pee jokes, which the prepubescent boys this movie is pitched at should find knee-slappingly hilarious.It's tough to be too tough on G of the J. All you need is a snippet of that infectuous theme song (Boom, boom, boom-boom ba, BOOM boom...) and you know you're in for a good time.Sorta made me want to curl up in a big chair with my noo-noo and munch my way through a bowl of Quisp!

The humor used in the film is very much like what would be found in cartoons, and is designed to be taken that way.

This really seems like it was designed both for children and for adults who remember the original cartoon, and I feel that it capticated these ideas very well and also captured the hearts of teens who secretly love cartoons but didn't want to be caught in a cartoon-ish movie theatre.

A boy is rised by apes, a woman ends up in the same forest, they meet, and fall in love. Adding to the story GotJ is filled with loveable characters (except for George himself). We have the elephant that behaves like a humongous sized dog, the over intelligent talking gorilla, three swahilian carries that always mock the bad white guy (fiance with the woman).George himself is played by Brendan, mostly fame for his Indiana Jones Lookalike character in The Mummy.

Usually when you turn comics or cartoons into live action something goes wrong but 'Jungle' is unique in that it has been transformed with immense success.This potentially cheesy movie made me laugh for its entire duration. The Narrator (voiced by Keith Scott) is particularly hilarious. The bronzed and stone-bellied Brandon Frasier is delightful as George - a role similar to the one he had in his prior film 'Encino Man'. The comic-looking Leslie Mann with her girlish curls also masters a voice that conveys cartoonish qualities to the big screen and she is the perfect 'mate' to Frasier's George.This is a great movie because it is not just one character that you love, but it is the entire cast. You will come to hate the baddies and adore the goodies. A lot of the comedy especially towards the end is slaps- stick but you would expect nothing less from a Tarzan wannabe who swings into trees, cakes, boats, vans, cars and anything else that's in his path.This is a great movie to watch with your family.

Things seem to be going well for the extremely luck George when he encounters his first ever female human being, the spunky, pretty heiress Ursula (the adorable Leslie Mann). Alas, big problems ensue when Ursula's smug wealthy jerk fiancé Lyle (a sublimely smarmy Thomas Haden Church) won't take no for an answer.

Many decades have gone by when George's quiet existence is interrupted by a group of explorers and their guides. When two of the party get attacked by a lion George is forced to intervene and carries the unconscious Ursula back to his tree house. As her boyfriend tries to track down the mysterious white ape, George and Ursula get to know one another.Opening with a cartoon opening sequence and a wonderfully absurd and catchy theme song, the switch to live action doesn't affect the tone of the film at all as it remains as silly as the opening. Of course in many ways this is a problem because the whole thing is very silly and you really need to buy into it to stop yourself being annoyed by it. But if you do get into it then it is actually quite a fun little piece of nonsense that can be watched in mixed groups of adults and children. The material is very obvious but the knowing humour and cartoon-style delivery make it work on this level and although I laughed only once or twice I generally found the energy of the film quite engaging. The plot is not really important but it does just about enough to hold the whole thing together.The cast are very much secondary to the whole air of the piece but they do well to buy into it. It is strange to see Fraser in this now as he has since been a good actor and also an action star, but here he is a good sport and takes to the role pretty well even if he is found wanting in anything other than daft moments. Mann is obvious and lacks the material to have a good time. Church is the butt of many a joke and wears it well, matching the material and tone. Cleese is always welcome and is amusing while minor support from Taylor and Roundtree is good fun. Scott's narration sets the tone well and he has nice lines to deliver.Overall this is a very silly film that will annoy anyone who doesn't get into the right mindset really early on. However to those that enter its own daffy universe, it is actually quite good fun &#150; unrelentingly childish and silly, it does have a cartoony energy to it that somehow manages to work, producing a film that will please children and some adults.

In another part of the jungle, a woman named Ursela Stanhope, was on vacation when suddenly her fianceé, Lyle Van De Groot, showed up. He had found her courtesy of two trackers, Max and Thor. Their guide, Mr Kwame, tells them the legend of the Great White Ape, seven feet tall, very strong who searches the jungle for the mate he seeks but will never find. The next day, Lyle decides to find the Great White Ape with Ursela when suddenly they run into a lion. Lyle runs back for help, leaving Ursela cornered. Suddenly, George swung to the rescue. Actually first he swung into a tree, but then he chased the lion off and swung Ursela to safety. They crash into another tree, knocking Ursela unconscious. George takes her to his treehouse where he lives with his friend, an ape named Ape. Ape could talk. When Ursela comes to, George introduces her to his giant, peanut-loving poochie, Shep the elephant. The two go search for Lyle but Ursela soon gives up the search and just enjoys George's company. Ape tries to teach George about the female of his species.       Lyle and the Swahili tour guides set out to find Ursela. Lyle soon catches a glimpse of George and decides to scare him off with his cigarette lighter gun, but the guides switch it with a real gun. Max and Thor try to tranquilize Ape but George races to the rescue just as Lyle shoots him. The aftermath Lyle, Max and Thor go to jail while Ursela returns to America with George. She takes him to her home town of San Fransisco. She dresses him in human clothes and leaves him home alone while going to explain to her parents why she isn't marrying Lyle anymore. George decided to explore this new jungle. He then spotted the biggest rope bridge in the world The Golden Gate bridge. He even came to the aid of a stranded parachuter! Soon the day of Ursela's engagement party arrived. Her parents, Arthur and Beatrice, didn't take much of a liking to George, especially when he swung through the wedding cake and slammed into the side of the catering truck. Beatrice pulled George aside and said he was forbidden to see Ursela again. Back at Ursela's apartment, George was feeling distraught. Back in Africa, Max and Thor got out of jail and went to find Ape and tranquilized him. Ape sent Tookie the messenger toucan to go find George. Tookie soon reaches George and he heads to Africa and races to Ape's rescue.        Max and Thor try getting Ape to Ape River, but they took a fake path that circled Ape Mountain six times before returning to the tree house. Ape chatted along the way while Thor quarreled with the narrator. Suddenly George swung to the rescue. Max and Thor beat him up but he soon fights back. Ursela then swings to the rescue. But suddenly Lyle appears. He escaped from jail and joined a cult. He's also become a mail-order minister so he could marry people and he was determined to marry Ursela. His men apprehended George while he made for the river with Ursela. Shep took care of the bad guys while George performed the biggest swing in jungle history to save Ursela. It goes fine until he crashes into a tree but in the process is able to procure Ursela while Lyle inadvertantly marries himself to a female ape. Well, George and Ursela were married and lived happily ever after. As for Ape, he got his own show in Las Vegas!        Pretty good film. Brendan Fraser was a good George. I was a little hard on Fraser in my Monkeybone review so I take back what I said about him and Chris Kattan. Leslie Mann was good too. I hear there will be a George of the Jungle 2 but not with the same actors. The kids will love this movie as much as the adults. Keith Scott is the narrator and he sounds alot like William Conrad!

This movie, however, blunts that edge.  The narration by Keith Scott is funny in of itself (like when Thor wonders why he's taking glee at the misfortunes of the bad guys, and he replies, Because I don't like you), but I would have liked to see more interaction between him and the other characters.  More importantly, there's more emphasis on Watch out for that tree! and other physical gags than on the verbal humor.  And while the film is on solid ground in the jungle, the CROCODILE DUNDEE type second half is a retread.It should be said that Fraser and Mann make an appealing duo, and Greg Cruttwell and Abraham Benrubi (from ER) are good villains, but Thomas Haden Church quickly becomes tiresome.

Thunderbirds, Lost In Space, Bewitched, and especially The Avengers, prove that people making modern movies to cash in on popular old TV shows keep making the same mistakes. Before another producer rolls out another bastardization of a good old TV series, would it be too much to ask that they consider why so many fail, and why George of the Jungle succeeded? This movie appeals to those of us who remember the old TV cartoons; it doesn't change more than it has to, it does not rest heavily on expensive effects, nor does it change the style of the original. But it also is popular with a new generation - my sons enjoyed it without knowing the original, because it has good (over)acting, innovative gags, and a deep-rooted sense of fun that comes from people who know what they are doing and can resist the temptation to rely on a known name to grab an audience.

Myself I gave a chuckle or two, but I didn't shake with uncontrollable mirth.  Brendon Fraser has the difficult task of translating the cartoon character George of the Jungle into a flesh and blood man who has an intelligence somewhat lower than the apes who reared him. There is plenty of Bang!, Crash! and Wham! as George swings among the treetops colliding frequently with a sturdy trunk.  Maybe it was funny the first time, but it goes on and on and ends up like a stale joke.  The idea of apes sending messages on the drums when danger approaches is a cute idea and the playful elephant who behaves like a dog is quite original too.  Even the toucan has his moments.  One of the funniest scenes is the kissing lesson where naive George is taught how to shape his lips for an ensuing kiss.  When Ursula finds George in his tree-house, she is much attracted by his physique and handsome face.  She decides to take him home to San Francisco. The outcome is obvious.  He embarrasses the civilized population with his jungle antics.  A shower bath becomes an unusual waterfall for George, and the cranes, bridges, lamp posts etc are irresistible objects to swing on.  Ursula, the daffy blond defends George to the end and they ride off into the sunset on an elephant with Just married painted on its rear end.  Funny? It's a whole lot of nonsense, of course and the actors probably had a great time bringing the cartoon characters to the silver screen.  I sincerely hope they don't make a sequel.

I purposely avoided GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE many times, with thoughts that the film will be loved by children and loathed by anyone above its age-limit. But when I finally saw the film, I'm pleased to say I was right about one thing, wrong about another. GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE was indeed a movie made for kids, and they'll loved it, yet somehow, I was surprised how decent the film was. I think that, to possibly enjoy the film's low-key charm is either to lower your expectations or at least, try to take a long with you the part of your mind that's still 8-years old. It's amateurish at every opportunity, but occasionally amusing. Brendan Fraser is acting like a total idiot, but is actually appropriate as the character of George, a man raised by apes in the uncharted jungles of Africa, so said by the film's narrator which is probably the film's funniest character. Leslie Mann plays Ursula, a woman from San Francisco who joins her fiancée Lyle (Thomas Haden Church) in his perilous adventure across African wilderness. But don't worry kids, nobody dies in this movie. They just get really bad boo-boo's.Part of the cast is funny, but not throughout the movie's running time. Usually, the movie relies on silly, immature slapsticks to attract its audiences. Unfortunately, only the kids will get a real kick out of them. Still, there are some funny moments in this film, mostly coming from the said narrator as well as John Cleese, offering his voice to the Ape called Ape. Rating **1/2 out of 5.

I was eleven years old at the time, and didn't know that George of the Jungle was based on a 1960s cartoon series of the same name, but I still loved the film! I watched this live action Disney flick a lot for a while, and from what I remember, it made me laugh much more than anything else had in a long while! Watching it again after not doing so for many years, I didn't find it very funny at all, but I could have been more disappointed.As a baby, George is lost in an African jungle after surviving a plane crash. He grows up in this jungle, raised by an ape named Ape. After he has grown up, a young American heiress named Ursula Stanhope goes on a trip to Africa. She finds herself in trouble when a lion sees her, but soon, she meets George for the first time, when he appears and rescues her! After this happens, George takes Ursula to his home (a tree house). As the two fall in love, Lyle Vandergroot, Ursula's fiancé (though she really doesn't want to marry him), searches for her with Max and Thor, and when they find George's tree house, trouble ensues! Make no mistake about it, this 1997 George of the Jungle movie is extremely silly and juvenile. While watching the movie recently, I may have snickered a bit around the beginning and smiled occasionally throughout, but for the most part, I kept a straight face. I may have even found some parts a tad embarrassing. It really didn't mean much to be anymore. However, it was still far from the worst movie watching experience I've ever had, no doubt about that. This movie does have its positive aspects, such as performances from certain cast members, especially the legendary John Cleese as An Ape Named Ape (you can always recognize his voice), and some parts of the film may be somewhat suspenseful.I have never seen any episodes of the original 1960s George of the Jungle cartoon series, so I can't say how much resemblance this 1990s movie has to it, nor can I say what fans of the cartoon would generally think of it. However, focusing on the movie, this 1997 live action Disney flick is definitely more for kids, who could find it very funny (like I once did). For adults, well, I can't really guarantee much. There's a chance you might hate it, but there's also a chance that you would find it mildly entertaining, if you're prepared for extreme silliness.

We didn't pick the movie, our mustache female-teacher did since she was anti-violence and what not.Anyway, this is the kind of movie thats nice for certain occasions. It has to be said that the movie is 'well predictable', no surprises cause you know what's going to happen... cause it happened before. The far majority of the jokes are 'physical', e.a. bump into tree, dizzy eyes, confused look and so forth. Now this can be funny on a short-term, but when it repeats itself over and over again it becomes rather irritating, at least to me and my little classmates back then.This movie is not suitable for adults nor teenagers, especially cause most of us have seen Crocodile Dundee which is fairly comparable to this movie but far superior. Though if you like a cartoonish style of acting, don't demand an in-depth story with intelligence/emotion and not too fancy special-FX then this may still please you. The Gorillas are not too well made but none-the-less funny characters, the Elephant was well made (digital) and its of course always funny to see an animal with an extreme identity crisis which doesn't suit its body. On the other hand, the fake-trees in which George keeps smacking himself into are way to obviously fake. So for ages 13+ I would not recommend it, I'd rate it barely average for such an audience.Fraser (George of the J.) is a good well-descend and talented actor but this movie does make me a little less fond of his performances.Now if you're going to watch this with 'kids' (preferably under the age of 11) this movie may very well please them. It's basically your average Disney-cartoon brought to life with adults that act like kids and animals that act like adults. What more can a child wish for?Looking for a good solid comedy with your (semi-)mature friends? skip it.Do you want to have a nice evening with your cute toddler on your lap laughing itself silly, then it's a well considerable alternative.

I found True Romance, with guns blazing, totally amusing. And now, I just sat through George of the Jungle and I sat amazed.I had thought it was some lame film like Dudley Do-Right, which I attempted to watch a while back. But where Dudley was ridiculous, George was rife with subtle comedy. The casting and the writing was superb. It was a slapstick comedy, of course, but it caused me to laugh out loud, which takes a bit of doing for me from a film. I mean, I enjoy George Carlin and Mum has an old record I used to listen to (when we had a record player) of Bob Newhart and I remember it to have been extremely funny. But when I go to Tower or wherever and look at the dvds at films that are in the comedy section, I often wonder if they are misplaced horror.George of the Jungle might have been a really stupid film, but all of the cast, especially Brendan Fraser as George and John Cleese as the talking ape named Ape, really pull off their roles with style.

He can really deliver the most outrageous situations with totally deadpan mock seriousness, which is the clue how to make these stories work. You have to be convinced the characters totally believe in what they're doing - otherwise nobody will. In fact I have a saying that you know you're watching a great comic performance when you get the impression that the actors know they're in a comedy, while the characters think they're in a drama. I also agree the Narrator is one of the highlights of this story, and adds a lot to the fun.I think Thomas Haden Church is actually slightly under-appreciated in this movie; making a comic villain work is rather tough, especially in a G-rated movie. You don't want to come on too strong and be a completely gut-wrenching psycho (though I know a lot of you sadists out there would prefer that), but you still have to come across as a legitimate threat.(Spoiler warning)My all-time favorite scene from this movie is the climactic leap George does. Brendan Frazer's delivery is spot-on. The dialog goes something like; George is about to make the biggest leap in the history of the world.

With a short running time of only 20-25 minutes of plot, it can be fatal to drag it out for more than an hour. This is not the first of its kind but it possibly one of the better live-action adaptations that have been presented to broader audiences of recent memory. There are a number reasons to why this stands true compared to other cartoons but it also contains flaws that many others have too. Therefore, it only constitutes as slightly above average.Audiences are introduced to George (Brendan Fraser), a simple-minded man brought up by the local Apes of Africa. One day he stumbles upon a beautiful tourist named Ursula (Leslie Mann) and they immediately began to fall for each other. To George's dismay, Ursula isn't single, for her fiancé Lyle (Thomas Hayden Church) is also in love with her - thus beginning the plot. There are a number of pluses that come with the bad here. Thankfully, there's a tad more good than bad. First are the characters. Brendan Fraser as George of the Jungle was perfect. Fraser not only can do action but also handles comedy with ease. His persona resembles that of a human cartoon; like Jim Carrey but not as extreme. Leslie Mann as the damsel is OK. She is definitely cute enough for the role but doesn't make her character stand out. For a female character that stands up to some high-end people, she's still ditsy. However, the other cast members help overshadow her performance. Thomas Hayden Church is funny because of how naive he is and his perception of the lower class locals when in fact; he is the lowest of the low. Heading the locals is Kwame (Richard Roundtree from the original Shaft (1971)) and he too has funny moments. Along with that is John Cleese's voice work as George's friend Ape. The intellectual dialog that he is given sounds preposterous but in a silly fun kind of way. Topping it off is Keith Scott's narration; he is possibly one of the more comical of characters even though he is never seen. What helps these characters actually make the film worth a watch is partly due to the writing, which involves breaking the fourth wall. This is not done once or twice, the count exceeds far more than many comedies actually do nowadays. But this particular element is what help makes it work and be funny. Unfortunately, the other part of the writing that doesn't work is what every other live-action cartoon movie includes; throwing the main characters into the current day. Relying on a character from decades before to make scenes comical by putting them in real world situations don't work very often. It's clichéd and it doesn't give a unique universe for the main characters. Originally it started out fun and different because it took place in a jungle where things would happen that many audiences don't see, but in the city? If it's called George of the JUNGLE, why is it taking place in the CITY?There's also some noticeable loopholes in the story that don't give any explanation to how certain characters knew or remembered various information. However, in some cases some of the situations that take place should not be considered because the movie does play out like a cartoon, which is important if it's based off of one. That also doesn't mean the special effects should remind audiences of that. Since this movie was released at a time where CGI was really starting to boom, it can be seen clear as daylight what is fake and what is real. Unfortunately, that badly dates it. It could be worse though because Marc Shaiman's score kept fidelity to the original theme but made it fun to listen to for the whole ride of the movie. It's better than most.The majority of characters and parts of the comedy are funny at times along with appropriate music. Yet, the story is cliché and the special effects are dated.

He looks the part but as soon as he opens his mouth .... well, it's a bit of a let-down. The talking ape (voiced by John Cleese) is a nice touch but very badly dubbed at times. The CGI elephant is a step too far insofar as it isn't really necessary and doesn't fit with the real or animatronic creatures too well. Also, everybody knows elephants can't jump! My favourite has to be the monkey, although the lion is a close second and at times it's hard to tell what's real lion and what isn't.Thankfully they didn't go too far down the 'jungle man kicks ass in the city' route and the bridge outing is mercifully short (I hate heights.) Mann, Taylor & Perry play the Stanhope clan perfectly, but the stereotypical English bad-guy doesn't impress. Nor does the unpleasant Lyle. The essence of this show is in the animals and the scenery, and some very funny if basic slapstick - although why they cut short the hilarious kung-fu gorillas scene is puzzling.A good family laugh-along movie, and most enjoyable as long as your expectations aren't too high.

When I screened this comedy for possible viewing in my classroom (I can't afford unpleasant surprises), I was soon convinced that 10 year olds' intelligence would be insulted if presented with this nonsense.This big budget film version can't hold a candle to the cartoon series I remember from my childhood. What happened? Why do Hollywood executives assume that today's kids are a few notches behind their parents? The jokes seemed dummied down, which makes them appear forced and completely unfunny.This film, obviously, did not make it to the show. The only film I've screened lately even worse than this one was Ace Ventura When Nature Calls. Destroy that one on sight! This year's biggest hit with my 4th graders Dennis The Menace (with Walter Matthau) and anything starring the character Mr. Bean (available in bite-size TV show format, 2 30 min. episodes per video).

His dim-witted idiocy was not appealing, it was annoying.  This film didn't create the classic cartoon's interesting atmosphere.  Fraser looks nothing like the original George.  His hair is too long.  Lack of a good script and idiocy beyond belief makes this film not-worth-watching.

During a safari, he encounters a beautiful damsel in distress (Mann) and immediately falls in love with her. Despite their differences in lifestyles, he leaves his beloved jungle and travels to the big city where he tries to win her affections and adapt to civilization. It more ways than one this inherently goofy, episodic film resembles an extended television series with zany characters and a predictable setup, but it's smart, funny, and the gags are right on target. Fraser&#x97;never more likable&#x97;is perfectly cast, Mann&#x97;irresistibly adorable&#x97;is an ideal leading lady, and they're both aided by a an amusingly sly narrator and an over-the-top Cleese who really scores as the voice of Ape. *** "},{"Title":"dumb and awful and solely for kids or those with very low standards","Date":"10 June 2007","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","Review":" I was very surprised when this movie debuted, as the reviews were generally quite good. And, since I had kids who were seven and three at the time, I took them to see this film. Unfortunately, while they liked it, I thoroughly hated it and felt that the film was designed almost exclusively for kids or those with very low standards. The problem was that Brandon Frasier was NOT enough to carry the film--even with the assistance of John Cleese as his best friend. And to make matters worse, the writing was just stupid and awful. The original George of the Jungle cartoons were pretty bad and it's a shame that this film didn't do much to improve on this. This film is strictly for young kids, as even teens will most likely think that this is a hokey mess.

Here you have it all rolled into one incredibly bad acting, yawnfully unstimulating story, flat characters, hollow jokes, cheap sets, budget television cinematography, and half-hearted stunts.This movie doesn't offer any of the appeal of the original cartoon which was funny and charming for what it was. In typical Disney fashion, beloved concepts are smashed and rendered into something that can be singularly translated into mass marketing. From videos to fast-food kid meals, we're served up a dish of slop that used to be a tasty confection of light entertainment in it's original form.Watching Brendan Fraser (who's budding career was luckily not destroyed by this movie) and Leslie Mann do the jungle dance to an uninspired Disney tune was terribly painful. One can only imagine the conditions in Hollywood that lead actors to gleefully sign such Devil's pacts.

Was Brendan Fraser playing George or the tree that he repeatedly slams into? No I wasn't sure either, I had to keep looking in the TV mag to check the credits. This is purely a kids movie and definately not a showcase for Fraser's acting talents he supposedly has. Not even John Cleese's vocal workout could enlighten me. 3/10. Sorry I don't think.

But what it is is terrible. It is a badly conceived load of utter rubbish which could only appeal to the lamest of brains or children. I like Brendan Fraser a lot, he is a good comedic actor but this is not a good comedy. Richard Roundtree must have been desperate to appear in such a film and has completely blown any credibility he used to have. I am aware that John Cleese has to pay loads of alimony to ex-wives so needs to do whatever comes his way and as he does not actually appear (just a voice performance) I imagine he simply did it for the money. It is a stupid movie for kids and has no other pretensions but when one compares it to , say Nanny McPhee, which is in similar unrealistic tone then it suffers very badly. It is the sort of film in which actors appear and then spend most of the rest of their career living it down.

I rented it because of Brendan Fraser ( who plays George ). I saw him in ' School Ties ' , a delightful film and one of his earlier ( and I think best )roles. Because of that film he caught my attention as a great and promising young actor. After seeing this horrible, not-funny-at-all copy of the Tarzan movies, I'm beginning to have second thoughts about his acting talents. Why does an actor with so much talents agree to star in a film like this ???? That's what I asked myself the entire 88 minutes of this absolutely boring film. I've seen a number of other films ( like ' Still breathing ' or ' Blast from the past') in which Brendan Fraser is really great, so why on earth did he need to accept a role in which the only thing he seems to be doing is smiling stupidly, flying around in a jaguar-print bikini and making irritating attempts at being the funniest guy in the jungle ?And not to mention the 'special effects'.....fake trees, silly puppet lions, and actors in shabby gorilla-outfits............. The only thing that I thougt could be called a ' special effect' was the computer generated elephant Shep, who thinks that he's a dog. It was the only thing in the film that looked ( sort of ) realistic to me.For little kids it might be entertaining, but I actually found this film in the adult section of our videostore, and thought it to be a little bit out of place there. As I said, I only rented it because of Fraser, and expected it to be silly, but at the end it proved to be even more stupid and meaningless as I imagined. Not funny at all, and a real shame for such a promising actor as Brendan Fraser !I give this wouldbe comedy 1 out of 10 for adults, and 6 out of 10 for children.

The original historical rendition, altho animated, thoughtfully dealt with the emotional difficulties of a young man raised by apes who jad to deal with the colonial invasions of his his own race. The real George was not only faced with his step parents ostracism but he saw his bigamous marriages broken up by advancing civilization and a jealous television producer. George with the aid of his faithful companion and spiritual advisor Ape, originally played by Ronald Colman in a marvelous uncredited performance, perservered and lived to conquer evil in the jungle. This caricature is unabashedly inaccurate, quite silly and suitable only for illiterate children under the age of 5 and emotionally challenged adults who watched The Flintstones or Jetsons in their ill spent youth.
