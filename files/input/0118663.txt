I was able to catch it when it appeared on TMN, our movie channel up here in Canada.  Being a fan of Robert Townsend, I really liked his past work like Hollywood Shuffle and his TV show The Parenthood, so I knew I was going to like this flick.  Though the beginning of the movie is a little on the weak side, it starts picking up to a nice pace and is entertaining. Some reviewers were offended by the way African-Americans are portrayed in this movie, as ghetto talking and jiving boneheads.  For me, I don't see it that way, I just see it as a comedy-straight up. I can see how people would be offended though, because most of the movies that came out before movies like Waiting to Exhale & The Brothers came out either portrayed the African-Americans as uneducated ghetto talking airheads, or gangsters, pimps, & drug dealers. Another thing I noticed from some of the reviews both on IMDB & other sources, is that the writers think that it has set back the clock for black actors etc.  It was directed by an African-American, which I may add, never received his just props in Hollywood.  In conclusion, if it makes you laugh, which the fine actors in this movie achieve whole heartedly, it's all good.

The actors and actresses made this a surefire hit for anyone who watches it, or at least in my opinion they did, obviously not a handful of other IMDbers, for Halle Berry and Natalie Desselie are remarkable and capture their characters wonderfully giving them so much lovableness that I couldn't help but care for their charades and experiences. It is so humorous and has great deliverance of the dialog, even if it's not the best dialog, beautiful scenario, the lighting at least in some scenes was gorgeous, and so many wonderful and unforgettable parts such as the bathroom scene, which I thought was the funniest scene in the movie, and when they're all out dancing around the end, which just makes me all warm inside because they're having such a good time without a care in the world, and that's what this movie was trying to show. I don't believe there was really anything particularly wrong with this movie at all except that of course it is very mediocre at times. I'm tired of everyone calling it absolutely terrible, because I have come to understand that most every black comedy on this website is unfairly maligned. It wasn't boring and it certainly was not overrated, and this movie is an awesome and compelling film that is so wonderfully put together and has so many scenes that just make you want to smile through the whole rest of the movie, which I did, even if I was crying, and to this day, I have loved it ever since my first viewing. If you're not racist/sexist like some on IMDb have the nerve to say they are, you can enjoy this movie, otherwise, just back off. "},{"Title":"Come On.  Lighten Up!

The story is almost a black Pygmalion in it's rags to riches type setting.  It's possible to see how it might have worked &#150; but I'm afraid it didn't work at all.  The story is unimportant if the laughs come fast and thick&#133;.however I barely smiled once.  The level of comedy is aimed at an audience who laugh simply because a character talks like a guest on Jerry Springer, ie squealing and yelling `girrrrrrrl!' etc.  The comedy never gets above this &#150; it's tacky and silly.Backing this up is Berry and Desselle.  Deselle is terrible &#150; simply hamming up her `blackness' &#150; it's amazing that black audiences are happy with stereotypes and caricatures like this.  Berry tries but is poor, mainly due to the material but also because she isn't a tacky country ho!  It's amazing that the makers of this film manage to make this classy lady look cheap and ugly by sticking her in gold teeth, cheap clothes and tacky personality.  Landau is embarrassing &#150; at times you can see him close his eyes and just thinking of his Ed Wood Oscar!  The only one that comes off well is Richardson's Manley &#150; although he is a white Jeffery (Fresh Prince).  The list of black cameos (Rodman, Leon, LL Cool J, several MTV vee-jays) don't actual add interest other than to make you wonder how so many managed to get involved in this.Overall this is not so much bad as just plain embarrassing for all involved.  It shows Berry's talent that she came out of this and managed to further her career.  Zero laughs, zero interest &#150; a million cringes, what a load of BAPS!

She's not really  an actress with a lot of tools. Instead, she wears just a few attitudes. The same few here  are all that were available in `Monster's Ball,' but they are much more apt here - that's  because the idea is to make fun of people who act life roles badly. Naturally, they lose all  the trashy affect by the end of the movie all they way to disappearing gold teeth.

This film is not, however, either soft-core porn or set in the baking industry. Here the word is an acronym for Black American Princess. The B*A*P*S of the title are Nisi (it's short for Denise)and her best friend Mickey, two black girls from Georgia who fly to Los Angeles to take part in a dancing contest. They don't win, but while they are in the city they are approached by a stranger who makes them a curious proposition. He tells them that he represents an elderly, dying, millionaire, Donald Blakemore, who many years ago was in love with Lily, his family's black maid. The deal is that Nisi will pose as Lily's granddaughter, in return for which she and Mickey will receive $10,000 and free board at the old man's mansion. The girls are so terminally naive they don't realise that this is all a scam and that they are being used as pawns in a scheme by Blakemore's nephew Isaac to defraud his uncle of his wealth.The term Black American Princess, coined on the analogy of Jewish American Princess, is sometimes used to describe young African-American women from wealthy, cultured backgrounds. Its use in this film, however, is deliberately ironic. Both Nisi and Mickey are from working-class backgrounds (Nisi is a waitress, Mickey a hairdresser) and neither can be described as cultured. Indeed, the film has been criticised by some African-Americans for perpetuating the stereotype of working-class black girls as loud, vulgar and tasteless. The film should have received special Razzie nominations for worst costume design and, even more worst hairstyles. Halle Berry, who stars as Nisi, is one of the world's most beautiful women, but even she finds it difficult to look attractive wearing a fluorescent orange trouser suit and with bleached blonde hair piled high on her head. The twist is that at the end of the film the girls become real princesses when Blakemore leaves them a legacy to reward them for the happiness they have brought into his life. With the benefits of their new-found wealth they abandon their gold teeth and false nails and dress more stylishly.The film has been described as a rags-to-riches fairytale along the lines of Cinderella, although I preferred one reviewer's comparison with Pygmalion; Cinderella achieved her good fortune by marrying a prince, whereas at the end of this film Nisi and Mickey return to their original boyfriends in Georgia. For all their vulgarity and lack of class, the girls are depicted as decent and kind-hearted, and therefore deserving of their unexpected good fortune. This characterisation, however, was never really convincing. Any woman who is offered a large sum of money to adopt a false identity really ought to realise that she is being used as part of some dishonest scheme; that Nisi fails to do so suggests she must be either terminally naive or terminally stupid.A number of good films have been made on the Cinderella or Pygmalion themes, such as My Fair Lady or Pretty Woman, but unfortunately B*A*P*s is not one of them. Catwoman (for which she won a Worst Actress Razzie to go with her Best Actress Oscar for Monster's Ball) is normally cited as Halle Berry's worst movie, but I found B*A*Ps far worse. Catwoman may be nonsense, but at least it is enjoyable nonsense, whereas B*A*P*s is a vulgar, tacky and witless comedy. There is very little humour in the script; you know that the scriptwriters are desperate when they have to resort to that old chestnut about the girl who is so unsophisticated she doesn't even realise what a bidet is for. The film was simply a waste of the talents of all those involved. Natalie Desselle, who plays Mickey, would not, on the evidence of this film, seem to have much talent to waste, but several of the others- not only Berry, but also Martin Landau as Blakemore and the late Ian Richardson as his stuffy butler Manley- deserved better than this. 3/10 "},{"Title":"Oy Vay","Date":"23 January 2002","Score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy","Review":"  The movie manages to insult just about everyone.

Berry was miserable in her old life, but she and a friend have a chance to audition for a rap video. They don't get that job, but an Italian servant to the rich man sees them in line to audition and offers them a job. The rich man's uptight butler wants to throw them out, but the man's nephew assures them it's ok. The nephew explains that his uncle had a Romeo and Juliet romance with the black housekeeper and has apparently never found a woman he loved since his family got rid of her. The nephew can't find the housekeeper, but to make his uncle happy in his last days, he pretends Berry is the man's granddaughter. Landau recovers and really begins to enjoy life, primarily because Berry's friend cooks him soul food. He plays a dying man and a party animal equally well.  The uptight butler loosens up and is particularly funny  in two places  buying rap music for Landau, and relaying messages to Berry's boyfriend (when Berry doesn't want to talk to him) on the phone, profanity and all (though I saw the TV version and don't know quite how much profanity).  Berry's friend starts a romance with the Italian servant, who claims to be a rich man who couldn't find a woman in Italy.  Possible spoilers here  unfortunately, he and the nephew both have less than ideal motives for their actions. The ending was quite interesting  no sound other than music, though you can pretty much tell what was happening.  And just in case you didn't figure it out, the words The End are replaced with The Beginning, and there's more.  The movie had several chances to be stereotypical but didn't take them.

Probably the same guy who keeps giving Byron Allen & Alfonso Ribiero new projects to be sucky on.This dreck is not so dumb it's funny, it's just dumb-da-dumb-dum-dum. There's potential aplenty but every last intended joke falls a city block short of the target, and B.A.P.S. owns the distinction of being one of only 3 movies I actually walked, no, make that RAN out of... Grease 2 & Johnny Mnemonic being the others.So there you go...

Although these women are supposed to be classless and tacky, the acting could have been better.  I have never seen such bad acting before. The end of the movie finally took a turn for the better. The ending is one that I did not expect. It is actually what saved the movie.

G-H-E-T-T-O! It was pretty bad, but a funny feel better about yourself bad. haha After a really bad date, I tuned into B.A.P.S. On cable. It made me laugh so hard. I'm a lover of really bad movies, this is a good one to make you feel better. Again this movie is a dumb funny comedy. "}]
