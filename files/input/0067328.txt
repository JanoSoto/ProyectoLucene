It is a film that was directed by Peter Bogdanovitch in 1971, yet almost 30 years later it still seems fresh and alive to me. There is a desolate, spare quality to the 1950's small west Texas town we are invited into and its desolation is apparent to us from the opening scenes.  It was filmed in black and white, which enhances the dramatic quality of the town and takes us back to a simpler time.  Just as our lives are discontinuous, with jarring scene changes and ridiculous episodes of embarrassing events, so is life presented to us in this small town.  The film's purposely jarring editing is transformed in our minds, as we watch, from a disjointed amalgam to a stream of consciousness effect that is very lifelike. One knows, then, that you are entering an alternative world just as real in its way as your own.  This movie pulls you in.There is no musical score in this film in the normal sense.  The only time you hear music is when a radio is on or a phonograph is playing in the background.  This lack of a musical score dubbed over the film enhances the illusion of reality.  Another aspect of this sound editing is the choice of music that is being played by the different characters.  Bogdonavitch uses song and artist selection to subtly comment on the character of the person or people who are listening to it.  In the case of Sonny the music he selects is always Hank Williams and it alludes to the hardscrabble life and down to earth quality of his character.   In contrast at JC's home, the manipulative teenager played by Cybil Sheppard, you hear a cover of a Hank William's song that has all of the life sucked out of it, similar to a Pat Boone cover of an Elvis Presley song.  It is a direct comment on JC and her family; her family has grown wealthy by owning oil wells and they pretend they are still the same people as before.  It is obvious they are not just by this simple musical selection.  It is eloquent in its simplicity.The center of the film and the major theme &#150; should you listen to your heart or your libido if the two don't combine in the same person?  Perhaps the saddest comment in this film is that too often these two halves to a whole do not come together as a package and people are forced to chose.   None of the characters are particularly happy with their mates.  Everyone is on the prowl for that perfect person they know they will be happy with. Time and again they think that they've found the perfect person based on their sexual attraction but when they begin to show their authentic selves are then rejected.   Those in long term relationships with an emotionally compatible mate but with no sexual interest face an equal dilemma &#150; a lack of excitement and joy &#150; and are destined to be the ones that reject.   It exposes both sides of this human dilemma, a duality that can become split and non-integrated, and does it in a sophisticated and lyrical way.   Most people experience this split at some time and in this film, as in life, there are no easy answers.  That's why I love this film.And there is Billy, the boy who continually sweeps the street in a hopeless gesture to turn back the inevitable, representing that demented and futile longing for a past that was never quite as good as you remember it.  He represents that longing for an illusion that disappears just as we are about to grasp it and the sadness of that.  The broom that is never fast enough for the blowing dust of time.

In the U.S., the early 1950s symbolized a transition from nineteenth century agrarian values to twentieth century urbanism. In the film, various people who live in the town must confront the reality that time moves on. Things change. Assumptions of previous generations give way to the untested assumptions of the future. The film's theme is thus American cultural change, and the personal disillusionment that such change can bring. It is a powerful theme, and the film imparts that theme with logical clarity and emotional frankness.In the hands of lesser talents, the subject matter of unimportant people doing unimportant things might have yielded a tiresome soap opera. But the film's script is poetic, the direction is skillful, the B&W cinematography is artistic, the casting is perfect, and the performances are superlative.The story draws heavily from early American individualism. Life here is mostly physical, not mental. Human relationships are direct, immediate, one-on-one. Except for schools, which are given some prominence, cultural institutions exist in the film only vaguely or not at all. For entertainment, people listen to radio, which features the mournful country-western music of Hank Williams. Or, they go to the town's decrepit picture show, where an elderly Miss Mosey kindly returns money to the kids who got there too late to see the cartoons.If the film has a weakness it is in the presentation of a realism that is incomplete. We see mostly stifling bleakness, though that is ameliorated somewhat by humor. What we don't see are the uplifting influences and the optimism that sustained agrarian generations through hardships and rough times.Nevertheless, within the film's story parameters, the film does convey an accurate account of what life was like for ordinary folks in West Texas in the early 1950s. I doubt that this film could be made today. Contemporary audiences have been conditioned to expect non-stop action, loudness, glitz, and overblown special effects, all of which are absent, mercifully, from this film.Low-key, perceptive, bleak, and melancholy, The Last Picture Show easily makes my list of Top Ten favorite films of all time.

(Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers mined the not inconsiderable drama of the first act of his life to sporadically great comic effect in 1984's Irreconcilable Differences. And his tragic love affair with Playboy model turned actress Dorothy Stratten is fictionalized in Bob Fosse's astonishing, horrifying Star 80 (1983). How many directors become characters in films?)Bogdanovich's love affair with film is undeniable, though it has, in the past three decades, yielded far more perplexing misfires (The Cat's Meow, At Long Last Love, Nickelodeon) than unqualified successes. That said, The Last Picture Show is an extraordinary accomplishment and worthy of its place in the list of great films of the 1970s.1971's other important films (Friedkin's The French Connection, Pakula's Klute, Kubrick's Clockwork Orange) are loud, angry, violent and contemporary &#150; in-your-face reflections of a society in which rage and nihilism, engendered by Vietnam and the growing discontent over government corruption, is the currency of communication. The uncertainty coursing through the veins of American pop culture also begat in equal, if not equally graphic, measure a palpable sense of sorrow at the destruction of a simpler way of life (no matter how true that memory may be). Like Jewison's Fiddler on the Roof and Altman's McCabe & Mrs. Miller, The Last Picture Show is a powerful and poignant evocation of the death of a community and a way of life. Thematically rich and imbued with Bogdanovich's remarkable knowledge and passion for film, the movie works on a dazzling number of levels; and Bogdanovich's use of nostalgia and traditional, archetypal genre conventions both enriches the movie and compounds the heartbreaking loss at the heart of the story.His deft handling of a cast comprised of then (largely) unknowns (Bridges, Bottoms, Shepherd) is first-rate and he draws forth superb, often sublime performances from everyone (in particular, Johnson, Burstyn and Leachman). There isn't a false note or a misstep in the movie and there is a naturalness here that is not easily achieved or earned. The great production design (by Bogdanovich's then wife and partner Polly Platt whose contributions to his work and her subsequent involvement in the best works of James L. Brooks should not go underestimated) and the achingly beautiful cinematography by the late Robert Surtees are vital to the success (emotionally, intellectually, thematically) of the film.The Last Picture Show is a truly rare work of surprising depth and emotional resonance; and the heartache for a time and place forever gone and the desperate and quiet struggles of its very real, very human denizens is matched only by the sorrow found in contemplation of Bogdanovich's Icarus-like fall from such exalted heights.

A modern adaptation would no doubt have adopted the voice-over approach of narrative, but here each scene is played out from a more objective point of view. The book consists of a series of events played out over a protracted period of time, with McMurtry's sparse but effective prose acting as a bridging device between scenes. The translation to the screen loses these links, giving the film a slightly episodic feel which runs counter to modern Hollywood film making practice. This is no bad thing, and in every other aspect the film follows the book almost literally, but watching it now does highlight the difference between the formulaic approach we are now accustomed to, with mise en scene, plot turning points and climaxes crudely and obviously spelt out, as opposed to that of Hollywood's final golden age, where the director was given more of a free reign to stamp his own identity on the film, and audiences were more receptive to different styles. Here the spirit of the novel is captured perfectly; that of the desperation and claustrophobia of small town life, where generation after generation undergo the same rites of passage, living out the same lives of frustration and unrealised dreams. The films strength is that it never forces us to identify with any one character, evenly distributing the amount of screen time over the different generations and, almost like a fly on the wall documentary (though heavily stylised in its powerfully expressive monochrome cinematography). Coupled with some sturdy performances from all of the members of the cast, and some memorable images, &#145;The Last Picture' comes across as an enchanting, evocative and accessible portrayal of a lifestyle most of us have never and will never experience. Now surely this is what the art of cinema is all about?  "},{"Title":"There are few perfect movies and this is one","Date":"7 March 2006","Score":"60 out of 70 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Here is a movie that perfectly captures a time and place. The time is the year between November, 1951 and November, 1952 and the place is Anarene, Texas, a small town in north central Texas. The screenplay was written by Larry McMurtry, in collaboration with director Bogdanovich, based on McMurtry's novel of the same name. Anarene is just south of Archer City, McMurtry's home town where the movie was filmed. McMurtry knows whereof he speaks, the movie has the feeling of total authenticity.The story centers around two best friends, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges), as they pass from being high school seniors into adult life. Given their backgrounds, coming from broken homes and living in boarding houses, there is little idea that they will go to college. The movie details how the two handle this pivotal and bewildering time from being on the high school football team one year to being on their own without much of a safety net the next. In a wider context the movie is about larger transitions from youth to adulthood for the young people, from a frustrated and bored middle age to an even less promising future for the older folks, and from a town with some social cohesiveness to a town dealing with the isolating effects of a bankrupt economy and the advent of television. The rather bleak prospects that Sonny and Duane face parallel the prospects of the town. You are made to think about transitions in your own life.The movie is populated with many finely drawn characters, all acted with supreme skill. There is not a false note struck in the entire movie. By the end we know the characters so well that they seem real. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar, and I don't understand why Timothy Bottoms was not nominated as well, since his performance is of equal quality. Bottoms plays Sonny with such genuine good-natured charm and honest sincerity that it is hard to believe he is acting. And Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman both won well-deserved Oscars. Kudos all round to the entire cast. The movie is beautifully filmed in black and white befitting the stark settings and story, and the time period. It is filmed as if it were made in the period portrayed.If you have ever lived in a small town or if you grew up in the American heartland in the 1950s, this movie will evoke overwhelming nostalgia. But the story is so powerfully told that I think that for everyone it will evoke nostalgia for a time and place, even for that which they may never have known.The town, as well as the movie, is held together by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) who owns the movie theater, the café, and the pool hall. In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, You wouldn't believe how this land has changed. The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land. And Sam's specific comment can be taken to apply more generally to the basic theme of the movie. This incredible scene ends with Sam's saying, Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous, and anyone who is not close to tears at that point will never truly appreciate the beauty of this movie.Seemingly this movie should be depressing, but the effect is more of a melancholic look into the lives of ordinary people who are just trying to play the hands they have been dealt in life.It wasn't until the movie was over and I was reading the credits that I realized how cleverly the music had been woven into the film. All of the music is from the time period and is a part of the action and not background music. It is played on home radios, car radios, truck radios, 45 rpm players, jukeboxes, and at a community Christmas dance. The Hank Williams song, heard on the radio in Sonny's old truck in the opening scene, Why Don't You Love Me Like You Used to Do? sets the tone for the music as well as the movie. There are great songs taken from over a dozen country and western classics from the era. Ruth (Cloris Leachman) is listening to Johnny Standley's quirky, It's in the Book, (a unique and strangely satirical offering to be popular at any time, let alone reach the pop charts and sell a million records in 1952) during the final scene between her and Sonny.Why is this movie so special? That's kind of like asking why one likes a certain piece of music or a painting. Everything comes together here in one of those magic moments - the acting, the filming, the story, the music, the editing - to create a simply-told and remarkably affecting work of art.

Bogdonovich pays a heartfelt tribute to the America of John Ford and Howard Hawks but the subject matter is contemporary, anguished, appropriate for the time in which it was made. Filmed by the great Robert Surtees in a flat black and white that perfectly evokes the bleakness of rural Texas life and peppered with a fine soundtrack of the popular country hits of the time, Bogdonovich creates a mise en scene understated and keenly observant of the details. It's also filled with McMurtry's trademark mix of humor and pathos. The cast (including Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Ellen Burstyn and Cloris Leachman) is letter-perfect but it's Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion who gives the film its center in an overwhelming (yet masterfully restrained) performance, Johnson unforgettably absorbs the town's despair, loneliness and regret; his short monologue about lost love is delivered with such deceptive simplicity that its power sneaks up on you unawares. One of the great performances and one of the groundbreaking films of the Seventies.

The kids feel hopeless. The adults go from person to person and have affairs and experience emptiness. There's some depressing football team that can't tackle. But mostly there is a street with dirt on it and a mentally challenged boy who likes to sweep. It is rife with symbols. This boy is trying to sweep away the dirt that is infesting the town, but he has no effect. As a matter of fact, he is victimized by the other boys in the town--part of their fun. We have the contrast of the rich family in town with the Ellen Burstyn character and, of course, her daughter played by Cybill Shepherd. The boys who are in a hopeless prison of the town's making are like a bunch of horny bulldogs. She is the queen in the town, but that's not much of an honor. These guys are going nowhere and she might just be there, like her mother, 20 years from now. The director builds a world that isn't pleasant, but it's certainly a total depiction of a place without a future. The movie theater represents a last connection with excitement and enjoyment. But nobody goes anymore.

The film deals with the hopelessness of a small Texas town in the mid-1950s.  All the people in the town are down for one reason or another.  The only thing that could bring the town together, the high school football team, is an utter disappointment to all who care.  And now the only shred of hope left in town, the old movie theater, is about to close its doors for good.  Timothy Bottoms is a young man trying to decide what he wants in life.  He has an attraction to classmate Cybill Shepherd, but she's involved with his best friend Jeff Bridges (in an Oscar-nominated part).  However, Shepherd is not sure that she wants to spend her life with Bridges so she gets involved with Randy Quaid, a son of a rich landowner, and his friends.  Bridges has the same thoughts about Shepherd and also struggles with his place within the town's landscape.  Bottoms becomes involved with his basketball coach's wife (Cloris Leachman in her Oscar-winning role), hoping that she will fill the void he has.  This does not work and he still has fixations on Shepherd, who somewhat gives in to him during the film.  All in all, there is no real love in any of the characters and they all suffer due to this fact.  Ellen Burstyn (also Oscar-nominated) plays Shepherd's mother, a woman that Shepherd does not want to be like when she's her age.  Eileen Brennan is also on hand as the insightful waitress at the town diner.  Perhaps the greatest connection within the town is the old wise cowboy who owns the theater and the diner.  Ben Johnson (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn) shines and when he passes away it seems that the last real glimmer of hope within the town died with him.  Everything in this film is almost perfect.  It shows how the lives of people in a small community can overlap and intertwine.  The fact that leaving the town is not a legitimate option to any of the characters only makes the story-line more heartbreaking and realistic.  People who have lived in a small town should be able to relate to this film.  To me this film was very accurate because I have lived in small Texas towns that are eerily similar to the town in this movie.  Larry McMurtry's screenplay and Peter Bogdanovich's direction keep the film engrossing and intriguing throughout.  However, it is the actors that make the film the true American classic that it is.  5 out of 5 stars             "}{"Title":"An American classic","Date":"31 October 2001","Score":"47 out of 65 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" In this nostalgic, atmospheric study of small town life in the fifties as seen a decade later, filmed on location in Wichita Falls and Archer City, Texas (from a novel by the incomparable Larry McMurtry), the force of slow, inevitable change is symbolized in the showing of the last picture at the local movie house. That last picture show, incidentally, is Howard Hawks' celebrated Western, Red River (1948) starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.Well, the movie houses came back to life as multiplexes charging eight bucks a pop, but the Western movie died out, and the boys watching that movie went their separate ways into manhood.Peter Bogdanovich's direction is episodic and leisurely, naturalistic with just a hint of the maudlin. We get a sense of the North Texas prairie wind blowing through a cattle town where there is not a lot to do and a whole lot of time to do it. Hungry women and a sense of drift. Boredom, gray skies and a lot of dust. You could set 'Anarene, Texas' down any place in southwestern or midwestern America, circa 1951, and you wouldn't have to change much a main drag, a Texaco gas station, a café, a feed store, flat lands all around, old pickup trucks and a pool hall, youngsters with a restless yearning to grow up, drinking beer out of brown bottles giggling and elbowing each other in the ribs, and the old boys playing dominoes and telling tales of bygone days.Robert Surtees's stark, yet romantic black and white cinematography, captures well that bygone era. The wide shot of the bus pulling out, taking Duane off to the Korean War with Sonny watching, standing by the Texaco station with the missing letter in the sign, was a tableau in motion, a moment stopped in our minds.Cybill Shepherd made her debut here as Jacy Farrow, a bored little rich girl playing at love and sexuality. Part of the restorations in the video not shown in theaters in the early seventies includes some footage of her in the buff after stripping on a diving board (!). She is as shallow as she is pretty, and one of the reasons for seeing this film, although in truth her performance, while engaging, was a little uneven.The rest of the cast was outstanding, in particular Timothy Bottoms whose Sonny Crawford is warm and forgiving, sweet and innocent. Jeff Bridges's Duane Jackson is two-faced, wild and careless, self-centered and probably going to die in Korea. Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman deservedly won Oscars as best supporting actors. Leachman was especially good as the lonely 40-year-old wife of the football coach who has an awkward affair with the 18-year-old Sonny, while Johnson played a lovable, crusty guy that the kids looked up to. Sam Bottoms played the retarded Billy with steady, tragic good humor. Ellen Burstyn as Jacy's terminally bored mother, and Eileen Brennan as the wise waitress with a hand on her hip were also very good.Memorable, but perhaps too obviously insertional, are the medley of country, pop, and rock and roll tunes from the late forties/early fifties jingling out of car radios and 45 record players throughout the film.Peter Bogdanovich followed this with some hits, including the comedy What's Up Doc (1972) with Barbra Streisand, Ryan O'Neal, and Madeline Kahn, and the excellent Paper Moon (1973) with Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, but then tailed off.I don't think he ever lived up to the promise of this film, an American classic not to be missed.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

It opens with the shot of a run down movie theatre, then spans the length of the whole run down town, and ends up focusing on a young kid in a run down truck. The situation appears very grim and rather hopeless.The film focuses on the life of Sonny, the kid in the run down truck that we are introduced to in the opening. Sonny is a poor boy, who has been somewhat abandoned by his parents. He's friends with the other poor kids in the town&#151;Dwayne, and Billy most notably. Billy is deaf, and a bit on the slow side&#151;he's Sam the Lion's son and Sonny has a real soft spot for him. Sam the Lion pretty much owns the town. We find Sam and Sonny to have a complex relationship, and one that will end up providing a circular theme for the film. Sam owns the town's pool hall, movie theatre, and café and is well-known and loved by everyone. What Sam says, goes, and we get this image of Sam as the kind of old cowboy ruling over the land. The town has a kind of old glory day feel about it&#151;the teenagers go to the movies at night and kiss in the back rows, they make out in cars and all seem rather innocent in their naiveté. However, there are more secrets to the town than are made apparent at first and we realize that this town is far from the perfect image of the west that we have been accustomed to in films up to this point.For example, Sonny gets into a sexual relationship with his basketball coach's wife when she gets too sad for anything else to make her happy. Jacy, the town's classic blonde, ends up being very sexually confused and troubled due to the odd relationship between her and her drunken mother, who is having an affair. The town rich kids are all messed up, having naked pool parties and sleeping with one another. Basically, it's a town that is the result of a changing society with changing ideals. There are a number of times in the film, where the noise from a television is the only sound the audience hears. It seems as if television is part of the changing values of the town&#151;especially after Sam the Lion dies. Once Sam dies, everything seems to take a turn for the worse. He leaves Sonny the pool hall and leaves the theatre in the hands of the old lady who had basically been running it before. Eventually, she needs to shut down the theatre, and even blames television as the reason why people don't want to go to the theatre anymore. Dwayne goes away to the army, he and Sonny get in a fight, and the preacher's son is even arrested for attempting to molest a little girl. It appears that with the death of the cowboy figure of the town, the whole town goes downhill, and at the same time, Sonny seems to be taking his place. He starts rolling cigarettes like Sam had, has his wild days with Jacy (coincidentally the daughter of Sam's old lover), runs the pool hall, and seems destined to simply follow in Sam's footsteps. The last scene, where Sonny returns to the house of his 40 year old lover, there is a loud laughter coming from the television. The conversation is serious, Mrs. Leachman is on the brink of nervous breakdown, Sonny has just witnessed the death of his friend Billy, Dwayne had just left for Korea, and Jacy was off at college. Sonny is the only one left, the last one standing. And the only sound of laughter coming from the sad house where Sonny is destined to spend the rest of his days with a married woman is coming from the television. The wild, wild west has been reduced to people in their houses wishing to be as happy as the people on the television. Instead, they have been doomed to live unfulfilling lives that will never live up to the standard of life in the old time western films in the closed down Royale theatre.

Peter Bogdonovich directed this incredible adaptation of Larry McMurtry's daring novel. It tells the story of a small town in the oil country of west Texas, and the lonely; desperate people who live there. The brilliant b&w photography of Robert Surtees along with the Hank Williams-rich soundtrack capture the early 1950's about as well as you could imagine. We are told the stories of some average folks having difficulty coping with the hands they've been dealt, as well as the emotional damage they do to one another. The film is moody, and it requires an attention span. But if you open yourself to it, you will find it a rewarding experience.Most of the action revolves around a high school senior named Sonny. He's played very well by Timothy Bottoms. He's a quiet and easy-going sort. His best friend Duane (Jeff Bridges) is a rambunctious alpha-male. Duane's girlfriend Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) is the town beauty who loves to tease the guys. These are three confused kids who get along great one moment, then are at each other's throats the next. Like so many young people, these kids are really at the mercy of their emotions and desires. They make foolish decisions at every turn and at times cause a great deal of hurt to those around them.The adults in town are an interesting bunch, themselves. The town's centerpiece is a man known as Sam The Lion. He's played by veteran actor Ben Johnson who won an Oscar for the role. A little speech he gives along the shore of a pond basically won it for him. In the DVD commentary, Bogdonovich notes that it was an overcast day, then miraculously the sun came out right as he was getting into the speech. They almost got the scene in one take, but Bottoms forgot his line about marriage and they had to include a cut. Too bad! Ellen Burstyn, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress, plays Jacy's bored mother. She spends her spare time romancing one of her husband's employees and dreaming of a more interesting life. Cloris Leachman, who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar, plays Ruth Popper. She's the neglected wife of the local high school football coach. She has an affair with Sonny who can't seem to find the right gal his age to date. Both of these women give amazingly real performances.We follow the lives of these individuals for the span of about a year. We share their secrets, we feel their emotions, and we understand their desires. Things come to a head in a shattering final sequence of events. Duane, still distraught over being dumped by Jacy several months earlier, boards a bus with a tear in his eye. The bus will be taking him away to the army, and certain combat in Korea. How about the shot of the bus driving out of town leaving Sonny all alone in the street? Next, a mentally challenged boy (played by Timothy's little brother Sam) is hit by a truck and killed moments later. Sonny and the boy were very close, and nobody else seems to give a damn. Sonny carries the boy's body off the street as a group of indignant adults simply watch. That scene was filmed in one take, and Bogdonovich himself was brought to tears after it was finished. Sonny then attempts to drive out of town, then realizes he has nowhere to go but back home to Ruth who he'd blown off months ago. He sheepishly shows up at her home and Cloris Leachman proceeds to win her Oscar with a tirade about his abandoning her. Notice how it merely takes one sideways glance from Sonny to melt her anger away....We get one last shot of the movie theater, now forced to close. Times they were a changin', but nothing has changed about this film. This is an American classic! 10 of 10 stars.The Hound.

Since it was the early 1970s instead of the '50s, a decade which saw a lot of soap opera films, the difference is the language and the nudity.This is a classic soap opera in which just about everyone in the movie is having some sexual encounter they shouldn't be having. This was Hollywood's updated version of a Peyton Place-type small town in Texas back in 1951. That said, there is excellent black-and-white photography and the movie is somewhat interesting despite its slowness, even for someone who doesn't care for melodramas, but the film overall is so-so and definitely overrated. I believe it was a critics' favorite because of all the the shock value it brought at the time. Part of the shock was seeing a full frontal nudity shot of Cybill Shepherd. Remember, just a handful of years prior to this film, there still was a morals code.Anyway, if you're a fan of melodramas and are not offended by profanity or gratuitous nudity, this is a movie you may want to check out, but don't let all the rave reviews fool you.

The film touches on many different subjects, such as the youth counterculture and friendship. The film follows the residents in the fictional small town of Anarene, Texas in the early 1950s. The main action revolves around Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and his best friend, Duane (Jeff Bridges). Right from the beginning of the film we realize that the town is small and there is no a lot to do. The kids hang out at the local pool hall ran by an enigmatic man called Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and the local theater, which is also owned by Sam. We find out that Sonny, Duane, and their classmates are getting ready to graduate soon and each kid is having trouble deciding what they want to do after school.Duane goes out with the most popular girl in school, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), who enjoys the popularity she receives considerably. Things begin to change in the town for all the kids in town. The coach of the basketball team asks Sonny if he could drive his wife to the doctor's office. We see Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman) as a very unhappy woman. Sonny notices this also and the two begin an affair. Meanwhile, Jacy tries to find a man to whom she can lose her virginity. It is apparent that she really does not want to be with Duane anymore after she ditches him on Christmas in order to go to a skinny-dipping party at another guy's house.All the characters, one way or another, want something more than what they have. Sonny wants a relationship, which he gets with Mrs. Popper, Duane wants his relationship with Jacy to last, and Jacy wants always to be the center of attention. The older characters in the story, Sam, the waitress at the local diner, Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), and Jacy's mother Lois (Ellen Burstyn), reminisce about how things used to be when they were younger and how much things have changed since then. Sonny's world is turned upside down when he learns that Sam has died. The boys always thought Sam to be a kind of mentor. Sam leaves his pool hall to Sonny, who continues to run it. After Duane leaves town, Sonny decides to break off his relationship with Mrs. Popper for a relationship with Jacy. Sonny even gets in a fight over Jacy with Duane when Duane returns. This results in Sonny being injured. Sonny even marries Jacy when she asks him. The marriage does not last long though and we soon find out that Jacy only married Sonny to get attention.In the end, Jacy leaves to go to college, Duane decides to go into the service to fight in Korea, and the last local business, the movie theater, shuts down. Duane, Sonny, and their friend Billy (Sam Bottoms) watch the very last showing of the very last movie shown at the theater, Red River (1948), a John Wayne Western. At the end of the film, Billy is killed when a truck hits him. Billy was a deaf mute, which is why he never heard the truck coming. Sonny is very distraught because everyone around him has either left, like Duane and Jacy, or died, like Sam and Billy. Sonny gets in his truck and drives away from town. It seems as though he might leave but then he turns around and drives back to town. He goes to see Mrs. Popper, who seems to be the only constant in Sonny's life. First, she rejects him, but eventually decides to forgive him and comfort him.This film seems to have all the themes of the movies of the time. It has the rebellious counterculture theme that was so prevalent in films such as Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Easy Rider (1969). It also contains the affair theme also found in The Graduate (1967) by showing Sonny's affair with Mrs. Popper. It has the theme of friendship also found in Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy (1969). The film also contains the theme of alienation, which pertains to all the aforementioned films. In the end, Sonny is left alone. The only person he has left is Mrs. Popper and his relationship with her is not stable nor is it moral.The Last Picture Show is a film about changes and how people react to those changes. The town changes so much throughout the movie as do the characters. Sonny does not react to change well at all. He seems very devastated when Sam dies, and he is even more devastated when Billy dies. He does not want Duane to leave and he even marries Jacy in order to keep something constant in his life. The only thing that seems constant to Sonny is his relationship with Mrs. Popper. When things get bad, he goes to her. The film is also about the death of the old west. The last film at the theater shown is a John Wayne western, which signals the end of that fictitious and glorified way of life. The film also deals a lot with nostalgia. Most of the characters have feelings of nostalgia. Duane wanted to keep Jacy and marry her, Jacy wanted to stay the center of attention, and Sam wanted to be young again. All of these characters come to terms with the changes occurring in their life while Sonny does not. When he gets scared, he runs to Mrs. Popper for comfort. The film is very interesting and well worth watching. It has interesting and unique characters, which the actors portray well. Just as the Greek philosopher Heraclitus said, There is nothing permanent except change. This quote seems to describe the central issues in The Last Picture Show to a tee.

There have been hundreds of movies made about Texas and Texans and some of them have been filmed in Texas with Texas actors and none of them have captured the true feeling and soul of Texas as TLPS was able to do. The story first was based on an excellent book by Larry McMurtry and brought to the screen through the insight of Peter Bogdanovich. McMurtry's book, LONESOME DOVE, is in my opinion, the Great American Novel, but it's transition to the screen is nothing more than a three-star oat-burner. However, TLPS rises above all that, again in my mind, because having come of age just 10 years after the time of this story I knew all the people and incidents played in the movie. Not literally, but figuratively because the country, ranching and oil field people of rural Texas had not changed whether they were in Archer City or Olney or Graham or most anywhere in Texas save the foreign cities of say, Houston, El Paso, Dallas or San Antonio which are basically Third-World mini-countries plopped unfortunately down on Texas soil.I digress, my connection with the story begins with my childhood best friend, Charles Graham, who's grandfather, Charlie Graham, founded the now ghost town of Anarene, just south of Archer City, and according to Charles and his father, Hap Graham, old Charlie Graham named the town after his wife, Anna, and his favorite horse, Reno. The town boomed in the early days of the 20th Century with a train station, hotel, post office and oil refinery. The Grahams owned a large ranch in the vicinity of Anarene that was also established by old Charlie Graham. In the summertime and on spring and fall breaks and when ever we were needed, we cowboyed all over that country.Being teenagers who drank, and with spirits available in Archer County, that is where Charlie and I chased girls. When the movie came out, I could almost see Charles and myself as Duane and Sonny. The scene where they arrive back in town and the night watchman's car is parked in front of the courthouse with the night watchman asleep in the front seat with his feet sticking out the driver's window is authentic. I have seen that myself.Sam the Lion's Poolhall, I played pool in there, and the old men sitting around the corner gas station, I knew them. That is where we had flats on the pickups and horse trailers fixed.The tank where Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion gave his Oscar winning speech was a place where we swam on hot days. I could go on, but it would fill a book. One other mention I would like to make is had I not missed a telephone call, I would have been one of the nude swimmers in the Jacy pool stripping scene and I might have had a more enriching movie career than the middling non-career I had. I have learned in my life that country people be they in Texas, Iowa, Ohio or where ever are real people and not the hicks and rubes as they are so often portrayed in the movies. I will always be proud that TLPS portrayed Texans as people and not as cretins who are nothing but fodder for ridicule.

I was blown away! The film will never leave my memory because of the brilliance of the script as well as the brilliance of the actors. That brilliance was in no small part as a result of Peter Bogdanovich and the remarkable casting that he did for the entire collection of roles in the film. I am sitting here thinking about what would have happened to the film if even one of those roles failed to jell. But they didn't fail! It was a remarkable feat to, first of all, assemble the cast and then to get such tremendous acting out of them. And for the most part the actors were so young. All of these comments are the product of an older man-I wonder what my thoughts were 34 years ago? The morose feeling of the film; the palpable sense of decay and death were feelings I had in '72 and last night they were simply condensed into admiration for the movie totality that Bogdanovich assembled. The choice of black and white; the choice of locations and the superb screen production-all made for an unforgettable cinematic experience.Juxtaposing the extraordinary decrepitude of the setting with the youth of the actors made for a truly harrowing story. The nature of small town America as well as small town Australia is something that must be experienced to understand properly. I only found out that Larry McMurtry was responsible for the novel from which this script was taken as well as the contemporary screen play for this year's academy award nominated film, Brokeback Mountain, after watching the DVD last evening.

In this final scene, she completely is this woman in the dingy bathrobe, with the uncombed hair and unkempt house.  But the appearance is only the icing.  The true strength of the performance comes from the words.  Her voice is at first passive and compliant, but after a moment of awkward politeness, the coffee cup shakes in her hand, and She unleashes this woman's anger, hurt, frustration, and sadness not only for her failed affair with the young Timothy Bottoms, but for all the years of whatever disappointments she has known in this dying Texas town.  The anger passes to calm and a resolution of sorts between herself and Bottoms develops, and she gently takes his hand.  Just moments after unleashing her pent-up fury, she has again become a sort of surrogate mother to this messed up boy.  Leachman seamlessly careens through a scale of emotions, culminating in one of the most deserved Oscar wins of all time.  Yes folks, Phyllis really is a hell of an actress.

In this film about adolescent sexual awakening, it is only appropriate that the first sexual encounter in the film take place in a darkened movie theatre. It is a sad piece of irony that the teenagers of this dead-end town, seem not to care, or are oblivious to, the escapism movies can provide. Instead, they utilize the cinema as merely another alternative to the backseat. The characters here are so confined to their homes, they seem unaware of the bigger world out there, even in the context of motion pictures. One of them, Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd in her film debut), will escape off to college, so we later understand why she is the quickest to embrace more worldly pastimes, such as the film's now-notorious salacious pool party. If the film gets off to a slow start, we forgive it. Surely it is less tedious for the viewers than it is for the residents of the town, who have been forced to endure its monotony for the better part of most of their lives. Particularly saddening is Jacy's mother (Ellen Burstyn), a woman who allows herself to remain trapped by a failed romance and uses alcohol as her escape. It is Cloris Leachman, however, who gives the film's best performance as Ruth Popper, wife of the high school football coach. The resurgence of her sexuality, in the context of an illicit affair with high school athlete Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), is in a way purer than any of the couplings of the film's adolescent characters. The most heart wrenching moment occurs in a quiet shot of Ruth alone on her bed, all dressed up, but sitting in the knowledge that her lover has abandoned her to become the latest conquest of high school vixen, Jacy. The Last Picture Show is one of those films where we care less about what happens, as opposed to how it happens. Very, very honestly is the manner in which events transpire here. Director Peter Bogdanovich skillfully avoids melodramatic elements that would have resulted in a Texas-set Peyton Place. When the film ended, I felt at though not a great deal had really happened. Perhaps that's the point. In one sequence near the end of the film, while Sonny Crawford is watching an athletic practice at his former high school, an old man approaches and remarks on how much better the team has become since Sonny graduated. Sonny remarks that he graduated one year ago. He too, like us, knows that not much has changed in that year. Anarene is a town that time just happens to. It will always have its Sonny's and Jacy's. Only now, it won't have a picture show for them to go to on Friday nights. Does this really matter? They never seemed to watch it anyway.

With that one line, we are instantly filled with apprehension about the future, and nostalgia for the past.  The cinematography is reminiscent of Ford; the dialogue, which seems as if it might have been written the morning the scene was shot, is reminiscent of Hawks.

Its main positive, as far as I'm concerned, is the stunning photography. But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty (and a kind of hidden beauty, at that). The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about. Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting, but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story, complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama -- everything from the boy cheating with his teacher's wife to the handicapped kid who everyone picks on. It was like American Graffiti without the joy of life.Some might say this film is more realistic -- nowadays a lot of people seem to think that realism is the only virtue a film can possess. But for me the film was simply oppressive, and I want to see it again about as badly as I'd like to spend a few hours in that miserable town the characters live in.Maybe this film really just belongs to its time -- perhaps if I'd seen it in 1971 I would have been impressed by its novelty, just by seeing something different on the screen. But that would basically assume that I had never seen anything like, say, Godard's Breathless. Maybe the overt references to classic films would have appealed to the movie geek in me and helped me to overlook some of the film's weaknesses. But in the post-Tarantino world that hardly seems unique or special either.It is interesting though how he uses the films in the film to give his own film more depth. We see 3 films as I recall in the picture show. First we see Vincente Minnelli's Father of the Bride -- Liz Taylor's exquisite looks provide a contrast to Sonny's girlfriend and Minnelli's studied upper-middle class milieu contrasts to the character's real life surroundings in a similar way. Later, clips from Howard Hawks' Red River emphasize the theme of a broken friendship between a mentor and a protégé. It really just reminds me that Bogdanovich is kissing his own mentor's butt, much as he did if I remember correctly by selecting a Hawks film as part of his own on-screen reverie with Boris Karloff in Targets. I guess in 1971 this kind of thing was new but looking at it today it just seems self-indulgent, like so much of the rest of this film.Ultimately, I'd rather see another film by Hawks, Ford or Minnelli than to have Bogdanovich's film remind us of why they were so striking in such a less-than-subtle way. Maybe he intends to remind us of the giants whose time had passed -- all he really does is remind us how small he and most of his contemporaries are in relation.

I thought of this film as what George Lucas was trying to achieve through the kids in American Graffiti but without all the 60's pop music and muscle cars.

In an artistic sense, does it advance the language of cinema?  Well, perhaps not as much as some other films have, but it did have a style of its own.  Some of the shots are simply marvelous, truly expressive without resorting to hammer and tongs. And the cinematography matches the subject beautifully.  While it's not Citizen Kane or Breathless, it certainly makes a contribution far above and beyond the call.What makes this movie great is its story--rarely has narrative film achieved such grandeur on a scale that is so small.  The Bicycle Thief is an apt comparison as far as squeezing so much story out of so little material. What could be so interesting about a bunch of hicks in a dusty, backwards Texas dot-on-the-map?  And yet the story is immense.  Comedy, tragedy, romance, desperation, treachery, love, death, infidelity, ennui, abandonment--it's all there, and portrayed with the loving caress absent in so much narrative film.Now, the power of the narrative certainly exists in the novel, but the actors and the director take the story to heart and lift it above mere words and into the sublime.  Everyone is note-for-note perfect in their acting. Everyone!  But Cloris Leachman--I don't know that I've ever been more blown away by a performance than by what Cloris Leachman achieves here.  I have no words that would do her justice--it's not even worth trying.  I guess all I can say is that repeated viewings have not dimmed the power of what she creates.

Other movies may outclass The Last Picture Show in one area or another, but I haven't seen one that combines these elements with such gentle, overwhelming power.

The film opens with shots of the gas pedal and the cracked windshield of Sonny's truck. These imperfections seem to foreshadow the tragedies that occur in the course of this film in that they symbolize the tough lives of the characters. This is one of my favorite films for its poignancy and socially aware theme. The Last Picture Show employs a host of psychological themes, as exemplified in each character. The roles of the characters are played by Jeff Bridges, Cybil Sheppard, Ellen Burstyn, Clorish Leachman, and Timothy Bottoms. There are also a myriad of symbols that define the action and the dramatic effect of this film. Though we see quite a few of the characters go through their trials and tribulations in everyday life, we don't fully get a sense of who they are. The film takes place in the 1950s, at a time when going to the movies was an industry in itself, but was dwindling by the middle of the decade, what with the advent of television. The closing of the theater in this town symbolizes the social change and psychological impact on a town whose only real pastime was going to the picture show. What does one do in this nowhere town? Going to the movies in the local, broken down theater seems to be one of the only few pastimes that one can engage in in this town.The film examines the rites of passage of the youth that call the town home. We see Duane Jackson, played by Jeff Bridges try to hold onto his girl Jacy Farrow, played by the town beauty queen (she's not really a beauty queen), the sweet and pretty Jacy, played by a very young Cybil Sheppard who bares all in two key scenes in the film. Jacy is pretty, but she's a hollow and shallow girl who is the daughter of a formerly beautiful, but still attractive mother, Ellen Burstyn. The Farrows are the well to do people in town and it seems every man in the town is chasing Jacy's innocent, yet seductive beauty, including Jacy's mother's boyfriend who tries to have an assignation with her in a pool hall.The acting by all the major actors in this film are outstanding, the characters may be one or two dimensional, but it is just such shallowness that defines the genius and talent of the respective actors in this film. Bogdanovich's masterful directing in this film, helped to make him famous. Cloris Leachman plays the lonely, love sick wife of the local football coach. She has a brief love affair with the much younger Duane. Each of the characters is a sort of stock character and cluster of people one might find in such a real life setting.Bodies of water seem to also take on a symbolic role in this film, one being the famous swimming pool scene and the other at the pond which precedes the pool scene. Both of these bodies of water seem to characterize or add to the personas of the characters who play in the scenes containing them. For example, when Jacy strips at the pool party with everyone watching, she then jumps off the diving board after throwing her under garment over the boy in the water's head, this suggests that she has a not so innocent streak in her and that she is just aching to get out of her shell. Later, Jacy loses her virginity in the Cactus Motel with her boyfriend, Duane. Most of the action involves subtle sexuality which to me, has tinges of Freudian symbolism.All in all, the acting is excellent and very convincing and the characters are pretty likable. This is one of the great, underrated films of all time and if you are a Hank Williams fan, the musical scores will delight you, their lyrics suggest the action that is taking place.

It represented the end of Hollywood and thus imagination and youth itself. The setting takes place in a town where everything is dead. The streets are empty and the sound of wind permeates everything. The teenagers of this town are a nostalgic representation of the 1950's, as if Leave it to Beaver met the Great Depression. From drive-thrus to diners, Chuck Taylor high tops to Dr. Pepper, this film touched upon some of the key elements of being young in this time. These elements can be fully encompassed by the Royal Cinema. With its demise, the youth culture of the town was chased away.Similar to movies in the 60's, The Last Picture Show has an element of escapism. This is evident in almost all of the young characters. Jacey goes off to college, Duane joins the army, and Sonny attempts to leave, only to turn around once again. His earlier attempts at eloping were foiled as well, bringing him back to his home town. These characters were not like the youth in the 60's in different ways. First and foremost, the film was set back in the 50's. Secondly, the movie was made in '71; these children seemed to be too young to be fully engrossed in the counterculture of the previous decade, which was now dying out as evidenced in other films such as Easy Rider. These characters also seemed to have a work ethic; from oil machinists to the mentally handicapped sweeper, these boys knew hard labor even though their town was in the slums. What was most interesting was the representation of adults in this film. With the exception of Sam, the adults seemed to act like children themselves, cheating on one another's spouses as if it meant nothing. What was worse was that everyone knew of these affairs, even their own children. Such was the case with Jacey and her mother. The blatant denial of responsibilities led to the sexual rebellion of the children. Not once in the movie was there a positive sexual experience that didn't involve anger, tears, or the occasional erectile dysfunction. What was most impressive about the movie was that it all stemmed back to the cinema. The cinema was last form of entertainment in the town and it, too, was going out of business. It was the popular spot for young lovers, a theme that is generated throughout history. The last picture show, itself, was a western classic with John Wayne, a truly American symbol. It brought two warring friends together in the end. The effect of Hollywood was the ultimate form of visual escapism that real Americans experienced. The Last Picture Show represented the changing climate in the youth culture of the day and issued in a new decade of cinema.

The character of Sam the Lion played by Ben Johnson (who also won an Oscar) represents the spirit of traditional western values. His death in the film symbolises the end of an era and the passing of a way of life.In the true spirit of 70s film making, this film was mature, truthful and innovative, while at the same time it harboured a deep respect for the tradition of American cinema that preceded it. This film is a eulogy to the American Western that pays homage to John Ford's similarly styled &#145;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence'. It examines a world that is caught in turmoil, where the defining values that once guided the people are disappearing and a lost generation is emerging. Bogdanovich and many of the cast members struck career peaks in this film, but sadly many of them were never to recapture that form again.

The film is about teenagers growing up in a rural Texas town during the 1950s, but `The Last Picture Show' is more than a dime-a-dozen coming of age tale. The film is more about life as the young characters face the decline of their small town at a time when security is a necessity. The sudden death of the town's most beloved citizen, Sam the Lion, strikes audience and character alike; due mostly to the passive energy of actor Ben Johnson. His death leads to a shift in morality in a town that leaned on him.The cast couldn't be better. New-comers Bottoms, Shepherd, and Bridges give the genuine performances that their roles demand while veterans Cloris Leachman and, especially, Ben Johnson give the performances of their careers.Director Bogdanovich's daring is a blessing to the story in which the actions of the characters must be earnestly portrayed despite the wolf-whistles that accompany the film's nude scenes by default. In Cybill Shepherd's controversial `stripping' scene at a nude pool party, one can see her hesitation and acknowledge the necessity of what she must do to conform. A lot of pluck from director and starlet alike contribute a great deal.Top-notch on all fronts, but avoid the sequel `Texasville' like the plague. 10/10 stars.

Having made that bow to pedantry, let me say something else. Rarely has any American director created a film as moving and as unforgettable as The Last Picture Show. Let me go even further and say that this is, in fact the film that The Magnificent Ambersons  COULD have been if RKO had not butchered it. Just as Ambersons is, in large part, a meditation on the changes wrought by the advent of the automobile, The Last Picture Show is a meditation on the changes wrought by the advent of  Television. In addition, it reflects on the death of the old, heroic west, symbolized by Sam the Lion, and the triumph of mediocrity and conformity. It is also one of the most moving accounts of adolescence ever put on the screen, surpassing almost any American film other than Rebel Without a Cause. Let me also commend the lustrous, black and white cinematography, the perfectly chosen score of classic pop and country songs, and the exquisitely  modulated acting. It goes beyond its dusty rural West Texas setting, and succeeds in reflecting the universal human condition. In short, it is more than a great film; it is a supremely moving work of art. One would have to be a space alien not to find it moving.

Yes, it is a well written, well acted and a beautifully shot film, but I still don't know why this film found such a deep niche in my mind? I wasn't from a small Texas town, in fact I have only lived in big cities. I wasn't born in the 1940s or 1950s, but in the 1970s. And I sure as heck never went through what Tim Bottoms or Jeff Bridges characters did. Yet this movie has struck a cord in my heart and I think it is one that any fan of New Hollywood should see because it works as almost a precurser to the fall of that group of directors.The film itself looks so wonderful in an airy black and white feel that sweeps over you like a gust of wind in the dry Texas heat. The young characters (Bottoms, Bridges, Sheppard, Quaid) are so wide-eyed and dopey, that it's like they aren't acting. And the older characters (Johnson, Leachman, Burstyn) are so bitter and jaded that you resent them for getting old and letting the world beat them. There isn't a false moment in the film. The last few moments of the film are so gut wrenching and pained that it was a wonder that the sequel (Texasville) was so light-hearted and weak.There isn't much fanfare for this film outside of movie buffs and Bogdanovich fans, which really amazes me because I think it was the high water maker of the decade (peaked too soon, I suppose) and of Bogdanovich's career. It wasn't even released on video until a few months ago. But that shouldn't stop anyone from renting it because it is a wonderful film.

As it was, this was my first look back then at folks like Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, and Cybil Shepherd. Tell me now, who didn't immediately fall head over heels for Shepherd after seeing this flick back in the day? As for Ben Johnson, his role here cemented my admiration of his work as an actor, having only seen him in various support and bit roles in Westerns prior. And for some odd reason, that bit of trivia about Cloris Leachman having been a Miss Chicago in 1946 somehow remained fixed in my mind for all these years. It was compelling to watch her character's appearance and demeanor change so dramatically throughout the picture, no doubt the basis for her Best Supporting Actress win for that year.I'm getting around to watching a whole host of pictures that I saw only once when they first came out, and I was somewhat surprised today to discover how bleak this picture actually is. Small town lives and ambitions crushed by mediocrity and boredom, punctuated by events that in some ways wind up defining the rest of their existence. Depressing realities for people like Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn), who marry for convenience and wind up living lives of quiet desperation; she sums it up herself - Everything is flat and empty here. Sure there's a way out if you're someone on the outside looking in, but it's never that easy, is it? One's life becomes entangled and ensnared in relation to others, and the next thing you know, you wind up working till you're a hundred (Eilleen Brennan's Genevieve) to take care of your obligations.The other aspect of small town life touched on was observed by waitress Genevieve - A person can't sneeze in this town without somebody offering a handkerchief. I don't know if anyone growing up in a big city can relate to that, I myself grew up in a town twice as big as Anarene, that is to say, a village of twenty two hundred instead of half that. It's true, you have a pretty good idea of what's going on with just about everyone else, and the flip side is they know about you too. When Genevieve made the remark, it was Sonny's (Tim Bottoms) first inkling that he just might be in trouble. And the odd thing is, he's never really called on it in a big way, even though each revelation that he's having an affair with a married woman comes as a jolt. Even the coach, as subtle as a brick in a punch bowl - You know a man never ought to cheat, unless it's for a good cause.The film is full of intriguing little nuances like that, masterfully directed by Peter Bogdanovich, who broke from conventional storytelling by filming in black and white, and replacing a traditional score with background music from juke box tunes of the era. The silence during Jacy's (Shepherd) diving board scene is particularly noticeable, until giggles break out as she subconsciously trips up to conceal her embarrassment. A well played scene that looked like it could have come from, well, real life.Aside from the story, I was intrigued by the selection of films playing at The Royal. An opening scene had Spencer Tracy's Father of the Bride, and an assortment of posters offered Sands of Iwo Jima, Cagney's White Heat, Winchester 73 and Wagon Master. That last one was a cool choice, it was one of Ben Johnson's few starring roles. I haven't seen that one actually, I'll have to get my hands on it.The Last Picture Show won't appeal to everyone, it's a dismally bleak picture for a lot of it's run time. But it's a fascinating one as well, and one of the best examples of pure cinema from the 1970's I can think of. Highly recommended as a movie, and more so as an experience.

I had heard about it through IMDB and was interested in seeing it. However, due to the fact that my local Family Video did not carry the film it drifted into the back of my mind. I joined Netflix last week and seized the opportunity to see this film. The Last Picture Show is a film about a small town in Texas in the 1950's. Anarene, Texas is desolate and on the verge of becoming a ghost town. The teenagers in the town only have movies to keep them entertained. However, since the theatre is closing there seems to be a lot less to do. Timothy Bottoms is Sonny Crawford, the innocent teenager who is given the town's poolhall and finds himself becoming a lifelong citizen of Anarene. Jeff Bridges is Duane Jackson, captain of the football team and dating the prettiest girl in town. Duane and Sonny are best friends and are both sick of the small town. Cybill Shepard makes her career debut as the beautiful Jacy Farrow. Jacy is the popular homecoming queen who is changing into the woman her mother has become. All the performances are great and really get the point across. This is a very character driven film and the lives of the characters are handled with care. As the story progresses through football and basketball seasons and then towards graduation the characters change. They make choices that effect their futures. Sonny is the main focus of the film as he goes through losing a mentor, having an affair with his coach's wife, and nearly distroying his friendship with Duane. You feel sorrow for Sonny as he ends one chapter of his life to begin another in the same place he was before. He is trapped in the town with no clear way of escaping. The script was adapted by Larry McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich from a novel by the former. Bogdanovich also directed it. The direction in this film is as engrossing and interesting to watch as the story being told. All the shots, save for one, were filmed at eye-level which I think makes the film more personal and small.Overall, I enjoyed the film. It was a well made character study that portrays the loneliness and boredom that surround the characters as they are confined to the small town. I rate it *** because it feels real in it's portrayal of small town life in the 50's.

In truth, people are people and every generation since the beginning of time is made up of many severely flawed people.  Sexual behaviour, violent differences between friends and the morality that tries to interject itself in the midst of all this chaos has been around since the beginning of man's existence.  'The Last Picture Show' is set in (very) small town Texas around 1950 and shows a group of people who sleep with each other (with strenuous results that follow) and how daily life can be a challenge among the tumbleweeds, wind, and dust that seems to kick up every time you open the door.  Depression, drinking, drug use and cold hard feelings for their fellow man is as rampant here as in any of the big cities.  Jeff Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd, Ellen Burstyn, Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman all shine in a film by director Peter Bogdanovich.  Bogdanovich has always been an interesting director.  I view him as someone who was shaken by the Hollywood system and the pressure it puts on its major players and rising stars.  Bogdanovich never really succeeded in displaying true greatness, much like directors William Friedkin and George Roy Hill who peaked for a moment or two but then faded into the background.'The Last Picture Show' has a slow pace but is one great film that has to be viewed to the very end in order to appreciate it as its absorbing qualities will test the boundaries of your attention span and mature audiences will appreciate this, especially those who view and appreciate all kinds of films frequently.

It is a film set in a different time period, but instead of being a time of excitement, it is a time of confusion between the Second World War and the Korean War. Bogdanovich shows us the small town of Anarene in Texas, and in particular the fragile lives of some of the younger people who live there. It is true that this movie contains no big car chases, no murders, and no truly exciting scenes. However, through the realistic portrayal of these mundane lives by the director and cast, the viewer can see how awkward things can be in a small American town during a time in history that has been disregarded.The film mainly focuses on the character of Sonny, and his interactions with the characters of Duane, Jacy, Sam the Lion and Ruth. All of these characters help us to realize what life is like in a small town, and what it is like to be unsure of one's future. Right away we can get a glimpse of a typical night for these teenagers, as Sonny meets his girlfriend at the picture show, where most people his age go on weekend nights. Sonny, who has been going steady with this girl for a year, forgets their anniversary, and then, after getting rejected in the front seat of his car, breaks up with her. This is our first sign that Sonny is tired of the typical life he leads and is interested in a change.Then, Sonny is given a new opportunity for change, as the wife of his football coach, Ruth, throws herself at him. They begin to have an affair that lasts for some time, and it appears as if Sonny has realized that the future he wants is with Ruth in Anarene. As their affair continues, Sonny's best friend Duane gets dumped by his long time girlfriend Jacy. His world is turned upside down by this, as he believed that Jacy was his future. Jacy is changed as she begins to look for a new future husband, and considering the possibility of going to college to get away from her small town life.As all this is going on, Sonny's mentor and friend Sam the Lion passes away while he and Duane are in Mexico for the weekend. Sam leaves Sonny his old pool hall in his will, and suddenly, Sonny's future seems totally mapped out. He'll stay in town, work at the pool hall, continue his affair with Ruth, and look after Sam's son Billy. However, Jacy, still looking for her future husband, moves Sonny's interests away from Ruth toward her.In the end, Sonny and Duane have a fight over Jacy, and ultimately make up before Duane is shipped out to Korea. Jacy goes off to college in Dallas, and Sonny goes back to Ruth, realizing that he is going to be living in Anarene the rest of his life, and he has to get to used to his mundane life. The film ends in confusion.In general, the Last Picture Show is a film that is difficult to look at in sections. The best way to understand and realize the greatness of this film is to take it as a whole, and look at the film for what it shows. Despite being set in a small town, during a forgotten time, the people who live there are real people, with real emotions and real hearts, and their lives, although not as exciting as others, can still be moving and empowering.

To the fall of 1951, the date is the eve of the Korean war, and the place we plan to stay for a year is the small American town in Western Texas called Anarene. One might call The Last Picture Show a coming of age film, but this is true not only for the teens who are becoming men and women, but also for the adults who feel the weight of their past lives, their hopes and dreams and passed opportunities on them. It is the dawn of a new area. Times are achanging for everyone, economically, culturally, socially, in every respect. Things won't stay the way they have been, and it's inevitable.One of Bogdanovic's very first and best films, The Last Picture Show has become an iconic depiction of American small town life rarely achieved again in such perfection. Even the director's very own continuation of the story made twenty years later cannot even be compared to this cinematic highlight. The film's forte aside from the strong cast (Ben Johnson, Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd and others), lies in its melancholy, in sketching the shadows that linger below the surface, in the tragedies buried there, in lives they shape and form, along with the aspirations the characters have. All these things are shown without going over the top and thus turning the picture into a melodramatic, overly nostalgic or sentimental elegy. These elements are all there of course, but the emphasis is different - on the realism of it, which makes us sympathize with the people involved, lets us feel at home for a while. Until the moment arrives when the very last picture is shown in Anarene's local cinema, a moment where we might be overwhelmed by a feeling of loss we cannot quite explain. Time then to head back in our capsule, endowed with the indisputable knowledge that things will never be the same again. Fortunately - thanks to this film - you can always come back to pay a visit.

In fact he owns just about everything there is to do in Anarene, except for watching the hapless Anarene High football team ... and sex. It is no wonder then that sex, in its many faceted varieties, plays a big role in this town, and in this movie.There are so many wonderful and memorable scenes that it would simply require a small volume to recount them. One scene that grabbed me was when Sam and Sonny are at a lake outside of town, ostensibly fishing, and Sam reminiscences about old times, about when he came to the lake twenty years earlier with a lover. Sam makes the comment, You wouldn't believe how this land has changed. The camera pans the surroundings and it is hard to see how this area could have changed much in the last thousand years, but Sam is clearly attuned to the subtle changes, since memories were impressed on him in a time of strong emotion. We all have clear memories from when and where we have been happy, even if it is a small lake in a desolate flat land. And Sam's specific comment can be taken to apply more generally to the basic theme of the movie. This incredible scene ends with Sam's saying, Being a decrepit old bag of bones, that's what's ridiculous, and anyone who is not close to tears at that point will never truly appreciate the beauty of this movie.

The world is changing, and the winds of changes are not limited to dust squalls only down Main Street, especially for two young high school students in their final year Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges).Like other small towns across the west, Anarene is dying &#x96; financially, culturally, socially and emotionally. Nothing much happens each day. Traffic is virtually non-existent; heck, there's not even a traffic light. Those who can, leave; those who can't &#x96; like Sonny, Duane and their school friends &#x96; must make do with whatever game in town there is...Which means they spend a lot of time in the pool hall and picture theater owned by Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) and the diner across Main Street run by Genevieve (Eileen Brennan). If not there, they're off sparking around town and maybe getting into trouble with the local prostitutes; or testing their mettle, so to speak, with their own girl friends, Duane's Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) and Sonny's Charlene Duggs (Sharon Taggart).While Duane's difficulties center upon keeping all other males away from Jacy &#x96; she being the prettiest girl in town &#x96; Sonny and Charlene break up, thus allowing Sonny to innocently fall into a situation with a much older married woman, Ruth Popper (Cloris Leachman), and with the inevitable complications of such a lopsided affair. Hovering around them are Jacy's mother, Lois Farrow (Ellen Burstyn) and father, Gene Farrow (Robert Glenn); a local stud and serious womanizer, Abilene (Clu Gulager); Billy (Sam Bottoms), a mentally-challenged helper in Sam's pool hall; and Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid), who introduces Jacy to skinny-dipping at some rich dude's place, much to Duane's displeasure. How they all interact to resolve their emotional troubles forms the basis of the second and third acts.But the focal point is Sam, Sam the Lion, and you'll find out how he got that name when you see this movie. Everybody comes to the pool hall at some time, and all the kids go to the movies at The Royal, where Sam shows great movies from the 1930s and 1940s. Ben Johnson, better known for his many roles in westerns, deservedly won Best Supporting Actor as the serious, sage and sentimental ol' timer. Equally, Cloris Leachman won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her work as Ruth Popper.When I first saw this movie in 1972, I knew I had seen an American classic picture perfect mise-en-scene, heart-breaking script, beautiful black and white photography that virtually puts you in that time and place, and a group of mostly young actors who acted and melded flawlessly under the direction of Peter Bogdanovich. Wisely, Bogdanovich avoided canned, moody music, allowing instead local radios, juke boxes etc to provide the perfect pitch of Hank Williams and other greats to keep this timeless illusion alive.Forty years after I saw it for the first time, I still think that TLPS is one of the finest American movies ever made.And just like the old saw says, they just don't make 'em like this any more.

What matters is that the generation of theorists turned filmmakers made its point get through. And the world followed them. Hollywood spent the decade recycling their own worn out models, and by 1970 they were in dire straits. The new generation embraced the french.Bogdanovich is also primarily a theorist. He thought cinema from the point of view of an outsider, not a practical guy, before he got in. So naturally, among the generation of young American filmmakers, he'd be one of those more eager to transplant the french method more unchanged. Their kind of deliberately empty writing, characters as part of a certain style, images as supporters of a certain quite yet desperate mood, and only very indirectly of an actual story. Map that into a certain idea of the end of a certain kind of rural, puritan way of life that America was going through at this time. This is something one can feel today, but probably will only connect with the people who know the context. Add to it the sexual passion that Bogdanovich shows for his than lover, Cybil Sheperd. He undresses her on-screen, he puts male characters fighting for her. But behind that we know he's the one caressing her. Their relation in real life affects deeply how the film and her character are presented to us.The trouble here is that Bogdanovich is someone who knows a lot about what he's making, but seems incapable of mastering it properly. He really engaged this crew, the acting is profoundly committed as it is rare to see. But the end result leads no where. I don't mean this in the traditional sense of a story not having a classic conclusion or a clear climax. I mean that the film is supposed to be like some films, instead of having an autonomous life, even if linked to a number of predecessors.

In between? you went to the war, you started to work ... no studies, no spring-breaks, no disco parties, no fast-foods, no easy sex and all that bullshit. Sex was just marital routine.Those were the old times. The young generation in The Last Picture Show is luckier. Not young enough to be treated as kids, not adult enough to think of another thing than kissing, hugging each other, and more. This more, Sonny's (Timotthy Bottoms) girlfriend wouldn't allow it, ending a pathetic amateurish relationship where she's being kissed in the theater by a boy who looks at Liz Taylor on the screen or Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) the beautiful girlfriend of his best buddy Duane (Jeff Bridges). Whores and sluts were still owning the monopoly in the sex business. Sex was mystery.In this black and white film, sex is the shadow. It hides, and feelings are hidden inside. When Sonny looks at Genevieve, the good-hearted waitress, you know what he might think of, the looks exchanged between the same Sonny and Ruth Popper is of a mysterious body-devouring appetite ... even Jacy's eyes playfully shine like a little girl with her doll. Boys are her doll. Sex is mystery for her, as she needs to 'know' then to be known as a girl 'who knows'. Sex is publicity. This desire of publicity serves a selfish goal  to be seduced by the right guy, Jacy use sex like a cop uses handcuffs. Jacy is beautiful, and beauty is the least likely quality to inspire humility. And this is what sex is all about  control, pride, for the guy who's done it and for the girl who ... forgive the phrasing, who had been done. And when it's done, it's done. The mystery's gone. And the girl too. Jacy followed her mother's advice, to have sex with Duane, to realize it's not that magic. Jacy's mother, Lois (Ellen Burstyn) is perfectly aware of the delusional aspect of sex ... and for one thing, she was wrong. Sex is magic for a girl like Jacy. So magic she makes it the second time with Lois's boyfriend in a less conventional place than a bed. The irony, a pool table, the very game, her poor dumped Duane was good at. Jacy indeed learns how to play with men. Sex is power.Meanwhile, Sonny, the main protagonist, lives after his break-up an extraordinary hidden romance with the most touching and heart-breaking character of the film, Ruth Popper, the gym coach's wife, brilliantly played by Cloris Leachman. He drives her to the doctor, she comes back shaken, desperately needing an arm to grab, a heart to feel. We get the point, Sonny doesn't, what makes him even more touching in Ruth's eyes. The relationship that grows between them is so sincere, so powerful. He doesn't just fill a gap, he provides Ruth what she needed the most, trust in her ability to be loved. Not as a friend, not as a mother-like figure. True love expressed through these shy movements on a squeaky bed, in a dark room. Sex as its purest, most fragile form. Sex as the expression of tenderness, of desire, of this mysterious sensation that transcends generations. The tears in Ruth's eyes say it all. Sex is catharsis.Yet, this sweet, tender relationship is almost destroyed by Jacy who turns Sonny's head. Jacy is too pretty not to be loved, even though Sonny doesn't love her as he loves Ruth. Ruth gave him her heart, but Jacy caricatured himself by becoming the quintessential trophy girl since she lost her innocence during that nudist party. But it's nothing compared to the pastor's son who showed another extreme how the lack of sex can lead to more immorality. Sex is perversity. Those are the risks due to too much or not enough sex. Like Ruth and Sonny who'll finally get back together, the movie swings between two generations. And the characters of Lois Farrow and the charismatic pool and cinema owner Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), are the soul of the film. A man and a woman who knew what sex is about. Lois shouts to her daughter Oh, don't be so mealymouthed. Sex is as eloquent for her, as a finger gesture while Sam, who lived a passionate romance with Lois, is nostalgic. He had his time, now it's gone. Sex is disillusion. Yeah, this era is gone. Hearts are as deserted as this little Texan town. Sam the Lion embodies this era with his old cinema where youth kisses in the dark, watching Red River ... TV is conquering America, there's no time for innocence anymore ... even the dim-witted, good-hearted Billy can't survive this world. Indeed, it's the Last Picture Show. The black and white combined with Hank William's folk songs paint this old classic feeling, the poignant scene between Sam and sonny even has this 'bad' quality that makes the film look older than real 50's movies. Beautiful cinematography incarnating the lost innocence ... which makes The Last Picture Show so modern, without being cynical, so sincere without being sappy.So, what is sex eventually all about? Well, as would say Sam the Lion, maybe sex is like fish, something we like to eat even if we must spent half our time picking out bone ...

A host of other sad characters populate this glum story Cloris Leachman's wall flower coach's wife, who begins a tentative affair with Bottoms when the coach is looking the other way; Ben Johnson's world-weary cowboy, who serves as a kind of sage to the young boys; Clu Galager's stud, who takes Cybil Shepherd on a pool table (or is that scene in the book only?); Eileen Brennan's salty diner waitress, who I wish was in the movie more; and, best of all, Ellen Burstyn, as Shepherd's reckless mom, who makes us see exactly from whom her daughter inherited her wayward tendencies.Filmed in stark black and white, the film has a brooding atmosphere, and Bogdanovich's no-frills direction perfectly captures the feeling of a forgotten place in which nothing ever happens and nothing ever will. Children and parents alike waste their days away in bored ennui, and both turn to the same things to fill their time sex, booze and brawling. The children have two choices turn into their parents, or run away and never come back.It's a shame that Bogdanovich never directed anything else as accomplished as this, because he proves himself to be a director in complete mastery of his medium.Grade A "},{"Title":"Gritty realism on the Texas plain","Date":"5 April 2007","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Peter Bogdanovich assembled a great cast of the up and coming generation for this film, made in the early 1970's.

The town is about to lose its movie theater.

Its influence on more recent movies, such as American Beauty and Ghost World, is quite obvious. It's ahead off its time, because it is brave enough to criticize society and to show us the lives of a group of people, just as they are, without sugar-coating them and not being afraid of making them sometimes unlikeable, just the way people are. The screenplay is very good. The characters are realistic and well written, and their attitudes and actions are always where they should be. The pace is just right; it's a slow movie, but always entertaining and thought provoking. The dialogs are great, and they always have double meaning, so you really have to be focused on them to get to the core of their meaning. The fact that the characters go to the movies and that's really important makes this beautiful for any movie buff. Besides, the end of the picture show, is, too, the end of an era, the death of a town.The acting is truly amazing, by just everyone. A look, a movement, the accents, the timing and delivery are just brilliant. all the actors were perfectly cast. Timothy Bottoms underplays a sensitive, shy character, but it works and makes the movie and his character not over the top. You can feel his pain, but in a subtle, still intense, way. Jeff Bridges makes an unlikeable character have a certain grace and you can root for him. He has a good timing and his feelings are real. Cybbil Shepherd has the most amazing body language you can get. She's seductive, sweet, mean, and most of all confused, and you can see all this just by looking at her. It's a complex character, and Shepherd has just the right look and freshness for the part. You can understand her character, even if you don't particularly like her. Cloris Leachman is incredibly expressive; her character is depressed and unhappy, and she's the nicest person. She's just so eager to be loved, and her movements show it all. Ellen Burstyn is very good, her character's in a point of her life in which she's stuck, without knowing how. Ben Johnson has some good delivery and you root for his character, but it's not that great.The direction is simple, focusing on the actors, but still brilliant. The ending, so full of meaning, Cybill Shepherd shots, the large shots, languid and beautiful, the close shots, emotional and touching and the use of light and dark. The black and white makes this nostalgic and beautiful. Overall, really impressive; ahead of its time, tackling important issues and technically impressive. It's a true classic.

The dead-end existence in a small town is well conveyed, and the film shows how sex is used as an escape and for a sense of connection. The sex in the film pointedly lacks eroticism, and the only couple that finds warmth and connection is Sonny(Timothy Bottoms) and Ruth(Cloris Leachman). Bottoms and Leachman are persuasive and moving, and the film belongs to them. Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Brennan, and Ben Johnson are fine but their characters are too often made to spout life's lessons. Shepherd in her first role looks right as Jacy, and Jeff Bridges is likable and convincing as Duane. Though I find the film a bit too drab, the film has integrity in its refusal to romanticize, and rightly avoids the glossiness of Peyton Place(57). However, not all of the characters or situations here are particularly interesting or adequately explored, and many of the townspeople seem to exist only when the principles are around. Jacy's father is barely glimpsed,and ditto Duane's mother and Sonny's father. Though many of the situations and types portrayed here are familiar from TV and film, The Last Picture Show is admirable in that its portrayal is without judgment or glamorization. Worthwhile film with some memorable scenes. Texasville, released 20 years later, is a pointless and unnecessary sequel.

What does that say about him? Well, he is a master of drama and a director that doesn't shy away from showing the whole picture, no matter how painful it can be. Thats what he does here. A period piece about loneliness and being trapped in a small desert town, it is at the same time a true picture of the 50's and what life was like back then. Timothy Bottoms and Jeff Bridges play Sonny and Duane, two boys on the verge of manhood who are stuck in a tiny Texas town of Anarene, dreaming about life outside of the dusty desert town while watching the picture shows. Sybill Shepherd in her big screen debut plays Jacey, the beautiful girlfriend of Duane who likes to play hard to get. Ben Johnson is their friend and mentor, an aging cowboy who talks about his only true love to Sonny and Duane and explains to them that even though it could be difficult to love her, she was still worth it.It is a strong candidate for the saddest, most depressing movie ever and the ending only strengthens that. Timothy Bottoms, practically unknown to me, gives a strong performance as a young boy/man who is left alone in a practically-deserted town after Duane, played equally well by Bridges, leaves for Korea and Jacey is taken away by her parents. Chloris Leachmann gives another strong performance as Sonny's unwanted but ultimately needed partner. The last scene was beyond words, I've never seen something so strong and poignant before. The cinematography adds a lot to the film despite it being in black and white. It all leaves a feeling of emptiness and despair, a feeling that was not uncommon in small towns in the 50's.

As the people of the town move on to bigger cities or better opportunities, Bogdanovich shows what was left behind a gas station with missing letters on its sign, people yearning for something more than the town can offer them, an old pool hall, a café with the regulars and a movie theatre forced into showing its last picture show as it declines in popularity with the population.Based on the novel, The Last Picture Show imagines life as it must have been at the Royal theatre. While the Western genre was alive, a small town in Texas could thrive, but as soon as that way of life dies out, the town goes with it. Bogdanovich displays this by matching the color schemes with the attitude of the place. The black and white cinematography captures the bleak atmosphere of the film. In the scene of Billy's death, a moment is caught in your mind as Sonny looks over to see tumbleweed floating by in the wind while a crowd of ignorant adults argue over the dead body. However, the true passing away of the Western comes with Sam's death. He was the thread of hope that this town offers something for rising generations, the diner and theatre. His entertainment drew in the teens, and kept them out of trouble. Without him around, the youths are forced to find amusement outside of the town.The slow movement within The Last Picture Show is presented in a true to life manner. Our lives are full of embarrassing, discontinuous episodes. Bogdanovich merely does what Andy Warhol once experimented with, the direction of life as it really appears to us. So while it may be slow moving, it expresses the same concerns that we face daily. How do we know if we will ever find that one person for us? Jacey offers a stereotypical high school girl caught up in the affairs of live and sexuality with confusion as the basis for her thoughts. She does not know what she wants in life, which is similar to the fact that we do not know for sure what we want in life until after we have found it. The affair that Leachman engages in as a 40-year-old further demonstrates the desperation that the people feel who are trapped within their lives with no way out. Ellen Burstyn dejectedly abandons all hope for love when she gave up Sam years ago, and we see the air let out of her life.The cast was outstanding in their performances, but especially Timothy Bottoms who played Sonny. His portrayal of a warm and fun loving adolescent on the verge of adulthood is endearing to his audience. His innocence, even in his guilt of an affair, is forgivable. There is a connection between him and the viewer that allows them to accept whatever he throws at them. All-in all the cast presents a memorable film to be enjoyed from all generations.

They are people with the most genuine of human qualities and frailties, filled with frustrated ambition and world beaten regret. The town and way of life is dying around them and they are going down with it. Escape can come only through fighting and dying in Korea or through the luxury of inherited wealth.The central protagonist is Sonny (Timothy Bottom's), an awkward, sensitive adolescent who, resigned to life in this small town, embarks in an affair with an older woman (Cloris Leachman) in order to fulfil his sexual yearnings. In his spare time he hangs out with his reckless, roughneck best friend, Duane (Jeff Bridges) and a mute child (Sam Bottoms) at the local pool hall, burger bar and two bit picture show - all run by the grizzled heartbeat of the local community, Sam The Lion.As Sam, Ben Johnson puts in a magnificent performance. Wily and weather-beaten, he brings an over bearing physical and moral strength to the character. His monologue at the fishing tank as he talks of his past and of having no regrets is one of the most perfect moments of cinema. Beautifully framed, he evokes the great cowboys of the past. He is the eulogy of a dying age. It is Sam who is the spine of the film and the man who really binds all the other characters together.Coming between the two friends is Duane's spoilt girlfriend Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) who longs for sexual experience yet is at the same time frightened by her own sexuality. She turns to other men to fulfil her needs, including a wealthy dullard (Randy Quaid) and an older man. As frustrating as her character is, it is impossible not to feel sympathy for her as we realise that she is nothing more than a confused adolescent in the middle of a sexual awakening. Her mother (the magnificent Ellen Burstyn) see's much of herself in her daughter and tries to help her, yet she too is rendered powerless by her own boredom and regret.Bogdanovich's direction is faultless, being at once claustrophobic yet at the same time giving the characters time and space to develop their nuances. The stark black and white cinematography adds a beautiful elegiac atmosphere (not unlike The Misfits ten years previously) whilst picking up the dusty, decaying surroundings in which these decaying lives are being played out. His use of early 50's country music standards only adds to the sense of longing.A bleak and honest look at the underbelly of Americana and the dying American dream, the films foreboding outlook is tempered only by its wonderfully sympathetic characterisation, sexual eroticism and wit. The final scene of the film sums up the previous two hours perfectly... An emotional train wreck dulled by the soft hand of reconciliation, comfort and humanity. Beautiful.

Life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene, Texas in the early 50's will be pretty dull too! What is it that so many people see in this? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really won't be anything to do in town. Duane (Jeff Bridges) makes that point at the end of the movie. But even before it closes there isn't much to do, so basically everything revolves around sex. High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town. You see, there's not much for them to do either - except to have sex (sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers) or to whine about the local high school football team. Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie. Sam (Ben Johnson) dies unexpectedly, but nothing really happens because of that, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) elope, but nothing really happens because of that, Joe Bob (Barc Doyle) kidnaps a little girl, but nothing really happens because of that. The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy (Sam Bottoms) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town, as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast.Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white, which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is, but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms, Shepherd, Bridges and Randy Quaid.

Taking place from November 1951 to October 1952, it concerns the bleak, desolate little town of Anarene, Texas which has been slowly dying for years and its inhabitants' sad, unfulfilled lives of wasted potential. What a great feel good film for the Christmas season! The film has an extremely strong script by McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich while Bogdanovich's direction hits all of the right notes. The beautiful black-and-white cinematography of Robert Surtees captures the look and feel of an early 1950s film very effectively but the same could hardly be said of the content as even its milder aspects would have fallen foul of the Hays Code. The film is permeated by a heavy sense of regret. In some respects, it reminded me of The Third Man in that its grim setting reflected the damaged lives of its characters. The film is basically an elegy to a dying town.The film stars Timothy Bottoms in a great performance as Sonny Crawford, a high school senior and one of the better adjusted, comparatively speaking, characters. In the beginning, Sonny is listless and is simply going through the motions with his girlfriend of a year Charlene Duggs so he breaks up with her. Like many of the townspeople, he feels as if there is something missing from his life and that he has no reason to live in Anarene other than that he is already there. After his high school coach Coach Popper asks him to drive her to the hospital, he begins an affair with his wife Ruth, played in a wonderful performance by Cloris Leachman. Ruth is severely depressed because of her poor and unsatisfying relationship with her husband - who is hinted to be gay - and finds solace in the arms of the much younger Sonny. As Anarene is a town where everyone knows everyone else and, more to the point, everyone else's business, their affair becomes an open secret but it is left ambiguous whether Coach Popper knows or even cares. After six months, Sonny abandons Ruth for a girl his own age named Jacy Farrow, which leads to Ruth becomes even more depressed. At the end of the film, however, he returns to her. He does so because he is upset and has nowhere else to go but he does seem truly remorseful. Sonny makes some serious mistakes but I do think that he is a good person. In a rather upsetting scene, his friends hire a prostitute for a younger boy named Billy who suffers from intellectual disabilities, ostensibly so he can lose his virginity but really for their own amusement. Sonny initially goes along with the plan, which does not go well. However, he is the only one to take sympathy on Billy afterwards and to apologise as he is very fond and protective of him. Appropriately enough, Billy was played by Bottoms' younger brother Sam.For his ten minute role as the local institution Sam the Lion, Ben Johnson won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar and it is easy to see why. In one of the film's best scenes which won him the Oscar, Sam recalls his failed relationship with his one true love in a beautifully written and performed speech which is imbued with loss and regret. He comments that about 80% of marriages are miserable which would be very depressing but, by Anarene standards, he is probably being a little optimistic. Ellen Burstyn gives one of the best performances as Jacy's mother Lois Farrow, a rich but unhappy housewife who has numerous affairs, most notably with her husband's employee Abilene. She deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. As her daughter, Cybill Shepherd is very good. Jacy is an interesting character as she is very manipulative. When a rich boy named Bobby Sheen refuses to have sex with her because she is a virgin, she finally agrees to have sex with her longtime boyfriend Duane Jackson, only to dump him almost immediately afterwards. Things do not go according to plan, however, as Bobby has gotten married in the meantime. Out of sheer boredom, she follows in her mother's footsteps and has sex with Abilene herself but that does not work out either. She then pursues a relationship with Sonny and, after a while, proposes that they get married. While Sonny certainly has feelings for her, he does not love her but nevertheless agrees. However, it turns out after she left a note to her parents telling them of their elopement and the marriage is not even consummated. She apparently only married Sonny for the thrill of disobeying her parents. Even her mother tells Sonny that he was better off with Ruth. Jeff Bridges is very good as Duane but I am surprised that he was likewise nominated for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar as I don't think that his performance was on that level. The film also features nice appearances from Clu Glulager as Abilene, Eileen Brennan as the world weary waitress Genevieve and Randy Quaid as the rather creepy rich boy Lester Marlow.Overall, this is an excellent film which explores the sad lives of people in a town that has lost all reason to exist. It was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar and deservedly so. One thing that I found very interesting about the numerous sex scenes is that they are all humiliating, either during the event or afterwards. In this sense, the characters' sex lives reflect every other aspect of their lives in Anarene. Towards the end of the film, the cinema shuts down and this marks the end of the town's cultural life. When Sam the Lion died, he took the town with him. It just took a few extra months to die.

This is primarily centered on kids who prodded by youth and sexuality find themselves pushing against the limits of their world, finding it small and flat. It's in the French vein of episodic vignettes that hope to capture playful winds as they blow through life. The town entertainer who owns the movie house is the moral voice and fatherly figure, what you'd expect from a movie by that generation who grew up in them and venerated them as a sort of ideal. Earlier this was an Italian mode of filmmaking, with the playing among ruins of war. This is set roughly in that era, we do have ruins but they are ruins of time and abandonment seen in the tarpaper roofs and dirty walls, tied to the remembrance of an old West.I suppose at the time, Nixon's time, a big argument against the film would be that it shies from political confrontation, opening up a romantic window to an older time instead of showing the streets now. The Czech were making films of this sort, French inspired, with a more or less covert bite against the regime, this is even softer. There is a war that eventually comes to loom over the prairie and steals one of the boys, Korea. There is adult meddling about love as the cop turns them back on the state line, adult indifference about the simpleton kid lying on the street in the end, pinning the fault on him. It may not have altogether satisfied a pressing need then, but it's all there.The two boys swap fates, he gets married to the other's girl, it's the other who joins the army as a way out of there. The first dream doesn't pan out, what says the second will?The film is most poignantly revealed in this kid who sweeps dusty streets in the midst of dust storms; the street is never going to be clean, but there's something beautiful and right about the perseverance.Yet there is something quaint about the whole thing that hasn't mellowed much by time. We're meant to see that the movies playing in the cinema are a window looking out at a broader world, and yet it's Hollywood's remembrance of one; the last picture shown is Red River, a last hurrah to this prairie. And it's all adapted from a book, the writing is fine but it does feel like something written in advance.The film itself is caught between worlds, trying to avoid actors and clear story but it's always pulled back to them. Cassavetes initialized this struggle in American film, escaping only one of the two, story. What holds this back is the nostalgia itself. Isn't this what manifests when Sonny turns back on the road? A sense of not being able to outrun that place of childhood. We have in the closing scenes a marvelous metaphor about the space of memory, empty walls with particles flying through.

The only way was down &, unfortunately, it nose-dived spectacularly. The Last Picture Show & Paper Moon were two of the very best movies of the 70's, especially TLPS. Shot in black & white for dramatic effect it also enables the viewer to really believe it was filmed when it is set, circa 1950, in the small mid-west town of Anarene, Texas. It is a really brilliant character study of a dying community & their interaction. The two principal characters Sonny & Duane (Timothy Bottoms & Jeff Bridges) are on the edge of manhood & do what all late teenage boys do, play football, drink & chase girls. The only other recreations open to them are the local café, pool hall & cinema all owned by Sam (Ben Johnson) a somewhat dour but down-to- earth, honest, & decent man. When he dies & the picture house has to close it is a metaphor for the death of the community. The towns characters are often delineated by the use of Hank Williams country & western music which was contemporary with the films time setting. The local young, treacherous & selfish beauty Jacy (Cybil Shepherd) is dating Duane. Cold,Cold Heart is played in the background to her introduction. Sonny has an affair with a lonely older married woman Ruth Popper played by Chloris Leachman. Her husband is the local high school football coach but he has little time for his wife & their marriage has gone stale & loveless. Ruth Popper, like Sam, is also a good sort but when Sonny, inevitably, fails to show up one day you really do feel for her. After Sonny has a brief dalliance with Jacy & at the films ending he returns to Ruth Popper's house. In a very moving scene she vents her anger & frustration on him but takes him back because her life is so lonely & empty. Why don't you love me like you used to do is yet another Hank Williams song used to imply a situation. To fully appreciate TLPS it simply must be seen.

Basically, set in 1951, the time at the end of World War II and toward the beginning of the Korean War, in the tiny town of Anarene, Texas, we follow a group of young men on the cusp of adulthood. They spend their time mostly going to the picture/movie house (cinema), playing football and hanging with girls, the main characters being senior year high school students Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), who has and dumps unpleasant girlfriend Charlene Duggs (Sharon Ullrick/Taggart) to have an affair with middle-aged Ruth Popper (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Cloris Leachman), and Duane Jackson (Oscar nominated Jeff Bridges), who is dating pretty and wealthy Jacy Farrow (Golden Globe nominated Cybill Shepherd), daughter of Lois (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ellen Burstyn). As they try continue with their routines and whatever existence they have, Anarene is actually dying a slow death as many of the residents move away to the big cities to get jobs and raise families, and the boys are not sure whether to follow suit. Duane and Sonny have the choice of staying in the town where the most they can earn is the inheritance of the movie house from their legend and mentor Sam the Lion (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Ben Johnson), or of course move away as well to better their lives more significantly, and their graduation approaching makes these decisions more critical. The big blow comes when many of the remaining residents are not attending the second film in double feature showings at the movie house, meaning that it is forced to be closed down, so in the end it seems like the boys have to move on after all, leaving Anarene pretty much completely deserted. Also starring BAFTA nominated Eileen Brennan as Genevieve, Clu Gulager as Abilene, Sam Bottoms as Billy, Randy Quaid as Lester Marlow, Joe Heathcock as The Sheriff, Bill Thurman as Coach Popper and Barc Doyle as Joe Bob Blanton. Young Bridges gives a good performance, as far as I remember Johnson and Leachman are very good in their award winning performances, and the direction by Bogdanovich is pretty good, I will admit that I didn't really see any plot, in my opinion almost nothing happened, but most of it was interesting enough, a fine classic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it won the BAFTA for Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Film. It was number 95 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies. Very good!

Johnson & Leachman both won and in my opinion Leachman's performance in particular was nothing short of awe-inspiring. I also feel that Timothy Bottoms was worthy of a nomination.Peter Bogdanovich's direction is well-handled throughout but it's the subtle touches that impress me the most. For instance, shooting in black & white was an inspired choice. Also, several times I was struck by the way that he focused on body language rather than dialogue to convey a character's emotions. Additionally, the authentic country & pop soundtrack (rather than a score) really adds to the atmosphere.In the end, what we have is an admirably directed, impressively acted film with a story that will captivate you for two hours and haunt your thoughts long after the screen has faded to black.

This is fine though, because even if it is a soap opera, it remains a powerful film. Its incredibly depressing with no real likable characters. All the characters find themselves in highly dysfunctional relationships, sexual or otherwise. Fortunately, the films characters are so well developed and the storyline constantly engrossing that this is set leagues above your average day time soap. The film exists as a character study, one which fleshes out its naive and arrogant but oddly sympathetic protagonists. This is a film without clear cut good guys or bad guys, which adds to its power.Another strong point of the film is its damning of traditional American mores and its presentation of small-town values as being a cesspool of hypocrisy. The characters in the film need to cover up their desires for fear of what the neighbors may think, despite the fact the neighbors are probably doing the same. Few films have presented the fact that on top of every seemingly ideal surface, corruption lurks underneath as well as this one does.On a technical level, this is terrific as well. The direction by Peter Bogdanovich and the cinematography by Robert Surtees create a truly evocative atmosphere of the time period in which the film is set. The film truly captures 50s small town life. The wonderful soundtrack of country oldies is also a major plus. The acting is mostly good - Timothy Bottoms, Jeff Bridges, and Cybil Sheppard are only okay, but they were very young at this point in their careers. The adult stars, especially Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman, turn in powerfully tragic performances. The Last Picture Show is a classic film that is mandatory viewing by any fan of powerful character dramas.

He had done cinematography for many big films in his career including The Graduate, The Summer of 42, Ben Hur, Quo Vadis, Oklahoma, Doctor Doolittle, King Soloman's Mines and many more.

Sonny and Duane are two boys that are trying to survive the best they can with what they have been given in life as their world crumbles around them. For them the world is this small town, Anarene, which is trying to adjust to the changing times. There are many images of decay and destruction in this film, as well as a theme of longing for the past.When the movie first opens we see a deserted street with empty storefronts. The wind is howling and dirt is flying everywhere. The buildings appear to be rundown and abandoned but later we learn that this is not entirely the case. There is life behind the walls, struggling to survive. Part of the decay and destruction in this film comes from the colliding of the generations. It seems as though there are two main age groups dealt with, the young adult and the middle aged adult. Sonny seems to have a Mrs. Robinson like complex and sleeps with his basketball coaches wife. An interesting scene that displays this is the first time they have sex. They show both of them in the frame undressing. Sonny is stumbling and pulling of his boots as he throws his jacket carelessly on the nearby chair. Simultaneously Ruth is undressing and hanging up her jackets and shirts. It isn't until she is almost completely undressed that she begins to falter and gets stuck in her slip. She is tearing away layers of her past and giving in to Sonny's youth. Nick is an older man that is a force in the small town. He seems to own and control everything that goes on in the tow. He is the epitome of longing. Nick looks at Sonny and Duane as if he wishes he could be young again and swimming with Lois. He talks about how the town was completely different when he was young and how there were mosquito trees back then. The generations collide as Sonny and Duane head off to Mexico. They are carefree and just want to escape and have a good time. As they pull away they say to Nick, Think the town can get along without us till Monday? Upon returning they see that the pool hall is closed, and the town is abandoned. Nick has died while they were away and nothing is the same after that moment. Sonny realizes that he can't waste his life anymore.Several times throughout the film we see Billy sweeping. There is also a scene where Nick is using a brush to clean off the pool table. They are both trying to restore things to the way they used to be. Billy's muteness may be the result of many factors, but he is the only neutral character in the movie. He symbolizes both the past and the future. When he dies they seem to collide. The second to last scene also struck me as I was watching it. Sonny has returned to Ruth, seemingly for comfort and out of guilt more then anything else. They are sitting at the table clutching hands, and as the camera fades away there is a gun on the wall pointing towards Sonny's head. It seemed like a very foreboding image as I was watching it, and made me unsure of Sonny's future. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, unlike many people in the town though. Then the scene fades into an image very much like how it began. The town is desolate once again and the wind is howling through it.

Sonny is headed down the same path of life that Sam lived. When Sam dies and Sonny inherits the pool hall from Sam, he basically turns into Sam. Sam lead a pretty dull and lonesome life mostly because he was trapped in the town, and by giving Sonny the pool hall it causes Sonny to get trapped in the town too because he can't leave the pool hall. He tries to leave after Billy dies, but he can't he is trapped.When Sonny, Sam, and Billy go fishing Sam tells Sonny the story about his affair with Lois Farrow many years ago. He tells Sonny they were wild and they loved each other and it was his true love but it ended because she grew up. He also said that they used to come out to the 'tank' where they were fishing and swim (naked) and be crazy together. Sonny then lives this story out with Lois's daughter Jacy. He has a fling with her and they go out to the 'tank' and get a little crazy and then they decide they are going to get married, but Jacy changes her mind. She purposely leaves her parents a note so that they will find them and stop the marriage. She does this because she has grown up and doesn't want to have the fling anymore so now the affair between Sonny and Jacy is over the same way that Sam and Lois's affair ended. And much like Sam Sonny will probably never find another girl to really be with because the one he really wants got away. The movie begins with the empty town and the wind blowing through to show how really empty it is and then we see Sonny going to the pool hall and Sam is there. Sam has no one except for the kids that come visit him and play pool. He was wild in his day like Sonny because of the story he tells and because when Sonny and Duane go to Mexico you can tell Sam wants to go, but he has grown up and matured. When Sam dies Sonny starts to take his place and live his life. He inherits the pool hall, he takes care of Billy, he has the same affair, but most of all he matures and becomes lonely. Duane goes to Korea to fight and maybe never return, Billy dies, Jacy goes to college, and his affair with Ruth Popper ends. In the end when he goes and visits Ruth she tells him he has finally grown up so that shows he has matured and his wild days are over. He is going to live the same dull lonely life as Sam did. Then the film fades out the same as it started. The camera pans back out of the empty town and this shows that the story is repeating itself because Sonny has taken over Sam's life. Sonny will live to tell the same story that Sam did to a young man someday and he will live the same life as Sam did. The story could start over with Sonny as Sam's part and another young man as Sonny because of the fact that Sonny is living Sam's life. The ending is the same as the beginning.

The film takes place the small town of Anarene, Texas during the 1950s.Sonny Crawford (Bottoms) and Duane Jackson (Bridges) live in the small Texas town of Anarene and are typical teenage boys. The film starts during their senior year of high school and both have girlfriends. The boys spend time at the local pool hall or going to the picture show with their girlfriends until Sonny loses his after the two basically got bored with each other. Duane's girlfriend Jacy (Shepherd) is the prettiest girl in town and at the start of the film she is a good girl but her mother (Burstyn) really wants her to break loose of Duane and explore the other men of the town. The film revolves around Sonny, Duane, and Jacy and how they experience sexuality in many ways from many suitors.Larry McMurtry and Peter Bogdanovich wrote one of the most spectacular screenplays of all time for this film. Never have I seen a film flow so brilliantly throughout and it does not have an ordinary structure of a film, it just continues through the characters' experiences. I find that the majority of great screenplays throughout history are character driven rather than plot driven because if you don't know and care about the character why should you care about the plot? The three lead roles in the film were so comprehensively built it was absolutely wonderful. I loved seeing when Sonny and his father had about a ten second conversation, in those ten seconds I was able to understand Sonny's entire family life. The theme of loss of innocence in this film was also absolutely wonderful, the screenplay was just terrific.Peter Bogdanovich's direction matched the brilliance of the screenplay that he co-wrote. There were hundreds of shots in this film that were so simply beautiful and were able to get me inside the characters mind and into a deeper level of the film. The scene with Jacy going to the naked pool party was wonderfully shot and will ironically be remembered. It just showed the curiosity of a young person trying to become an adult. Also I really loved the final scene of the film, but I will go into no detail in order to not spoil it for those who have not seen it. Sadly Bogdanovich has not directed another film as wonderful as this one.Not only did Bogdanovich write and direct a great film, he got two Oscar winning performances from his actors. One is not from Timothy Bottoms, but I thought he gave an amazing performance as an innocent young boy trying to become a man. Some of this best acting would have to be with Cloris Leachman when they are having an affair. His simple expressions are just magnificent in showing his confusion about the world that surrounds him. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Oscar for playing a simple teenager on the outside but a boy longing for love on the inside. Definitely one of the best performances of his very successful career. Cybill Shepherd's character Jacy was definitely one of the most interesting characters in this film in how she wanted to experience pure lovemaking and bliss, and not end up like her mother. She was absolutely stunning, like the rest of the cast. Ben Johnson won the Oscar for his role as Sam the Lion. The scene in which he showed why he deserved to win was when his son came home with a bloody nose and he told the other boys to leave him alone as a tired old man who was done fighting. That was one of the most effective scenes in the film and will also always remain in my memory. Cloris Leachman won an Oscar as well for her performance as a woman who is depressed with her marriage and has an affair with the young Sonny Crawford. The weakness in her face while performing was just enchanting, everything about her was so real. This film definitely has one of the greatest ensemble performances of all time.The editing by Donn Cambern was spectacularly done, I really liked how the film was in black and white making the simple town even simpler. If this was in color I could not really see myself liking it as much and that is why this decision was extremely well executed. The film flowed seamlessly going from character to character. I was completely engaged the whole entire film and never was the rhythm broken. Many films with multiple stories don't work out well because the editing makes it like a break in the film and that takes you out of the film experience.I really loved the country music that was used throughout the film. It added another layer of simplicity to small town and the black and white appearance. Music is key to making a film flow like the editing and this film did it wonderfully letting the songs express the language of the film.Overall I give this film a 10/10. It is one of the greatest films of all time and is wonderful in every aspect of it. There is nothing I could say that is wrong with this film, I absolutely loved it. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys extremely powerful dramas about the loss of innocence because this is one of the greatest ever. Ever. Go see it right now.

This can be seen, in a sense, in how he treats the material of Larry McMurtry's source. The Last Picture Show deals frankly with sexuality, but more impressively, and with more of a lasting impact, on how not being able to deal with emotions leads to a kind of nakedness and vulnerability that is shielded away, particularly in a small Texas town such as Anarene. Not much goes on- sometimes the only thing to do is to split town and see if it'll be possible to take an aimless trip to Mexico in the middle of the night- though that is just on the surface of a tiny town such as this. There's a sense of sexual paranoia, of loneliness, that gets tapped into very well by Bogdanovich on his two main plot-lines one involving teens (i.e. Cybil Shepherd as Jacey, Jeff Bridges as Duane Jackson, the Bottoms brothers), and their escapism into movies, sports, and sex, and a middle-aged woman (Cloris Leachman) and her lack of companionship, mirrored in her sort of loneliness by the barren side to the town itself, as people move out in droves.From the opening shot- one of the best of any film of the 70s- to the final scene with the screening of Red River, this is a near classic of the period, where there was an overlap between the past films with more of an emphasis on the proud and beautiful side of Americana, and the not exactly darker side but the one people usually wouldn't put on film. It's sometimes very funny (how could finally 'making it' with Jacey go wrong?), and a little surprising in how it gets explicit (pool scene is actually very steamy for a black and white movie), but there's an undercurrent that Bogdanovich doesn't play up too much into the last act, which has been building steadily through the film. Featuring other good supporting work from Burstyn and Ben Johnson, alongside the outstanding Leachman and promising Bridges (Shepherd works best in the role when she has to quietly subvert, as Bogdanovich does more often, with the material), and a true sense for period as well as reality, the Last Picture Show has been fresh in my mind for years now, and I look forward to seeing it again like few other American films of 1971.

Basically in the whole town, there only is a cinema and a run-down pool hall for entertainment. So basically all the characters have in the movie is each other. Which makes it all the more difficult for the outcasts and those who don't like each other in the very small town. Especially the youth is the victim of this boring place. They are torn between several issues, which all have to do with the transition between puberty and adulthood and they come to the point at which they have to make some life-changing decisions.The Last Picture Show is a real character movie that is driven by its actors and subtle directing from Peter Bogdanovich. There isn't a real plot in terms of having a beginning, middle and ending. It more is a character observation of several different persons who are all forced to make several decisions and all have in common that they all live in the same small Texan town, in which they can basically only fall back on the run-down pool hall and cinema. By the time the pool hall is closed and at the cinema the last picture is shown (hench the title), all the characters have to make the choices what to do with the rest of their lives.The movie is shot entirely in black & white and made in the same style as movies from the 40's/early '50's. It's quite risqué to make a movie in a totally different style and 'old' style of movie-making but in this particular case it suits the story and movie well. It perfectly captures the mood of the depressing, boring '50's. There are some awkward unusual moments in the movie because of this style (especially in its editing) but I just took those moments for granted, since the style suited the story and the movie so well. Also the cinematography from Robert Surtees, who perhaps in my opinion was the best cinematographer of the '40's/50's and early '60's, is quite perfect.The movie is however a bit too slow at times, even for my taste. Perhaps not really slow in terms of pace but more slow in terms of story-flow and consistency. Not everything that happens in the movie seems to serve a purpose for the movie but then again, life is filled with moments that don't seem to serve a purpose. So you can say that the movie is realistic, just not always interesting.This movie really launched the career of several actors, such as the still very young Jeff Bridges and Randy Quaid. Also Ellen Burstyn is present as well as many other well known and respected actors of that time period.It's a cliché but they don't make them like this anymore.

While I can admire the well drawn themes and characters here, I need more structure than this to really get involved in a movie. Not everything has to be Die Hard or Memento. I just prefer something more than people desultorily floating through an amorphous, narrative cloud.In the early 1950s, Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms) is a teenager in a small town so barren, many of the residents seem more like ghosts than living human beings. His life is dominated by his oil rig roughneck friend Dwayne (Jeff Bridges), the imposing local pool hall owner Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), Sam's slow witted son Billy (Sam Bottoms) and Genevieve (Eileen Brennan), the quietly defiant waitress at the local diner. The story basically follows Sonny as he drifts along through Dwayne's troubles with his country club girlfriend, the flighty drama queen Jacy (Cybill Shepherd), and into a relationship with Ruth (Cloris Leachman), the wife of Sonny's high school football and basketball coach. There's also Lois (Ellen Burstyn), Jacy's frustrated mother who hopes her daughter can avoid following in her empty footsteps.It's hard to get too much more than that into The Last Picture Show because this is one of those films when time passes and stuff sorta happens. Sometimes you can't tell if days, weeks or months have elapsed between scenes. This is also one of those films where you wait, wait, wait, wait around for one of the characters to have a big emotional explosion. I only managed to wait and wait before losing my interest in seeing that happen. The acting is very good, especially Jeff Bridges, Ellen Burstyn and Cloris Leachman, and I could appreciate the depiction of people trapped in lives of regret. After about 45 minutes of that, though, I was in the mood for something more. While legitimately artistic, this motion picture isn't all that entertaining.Compounding matters is the passive nature of both the character of Sonny and the performance of Timothy Bottoms. It's easy to see why Bridges and Cybill Shepherd emerged from this as stars and Bottoms didn't, but he wasn't done any favors by being given a role that mostly asked him to cycle through a series of expressions that went from mournful to plaintive and back again with little else involved. You can see the problems with the role clearly in how Sonny engages in a month's long affair with the coach's wife, yet the physical and emotional intimacy with her has no discernible effect on anything about Sonny. If nothing else, the sexual experience should meant something when things turn to Jacy enticing Sonny into a furtive relationship.If you've enjoyed other work by Bogdanovich, you'll probably love The Last Picture Show. If you're just young enough to identify with the kids but still old enough to be intrigued with the humanity shown by their elders, you also might get more out of this than me. I'm not sure there's enough here to elevate it over more recent work with a similar style and temperament. And yes, that includes Shepherd's nude scene.

How perfect this is. No grand farewell as the inspiring teacher rides into the sunlight, a la Mona Lisa Smile. Jeff Bridges has gone into the Army, Cybill Shepherd has left town and Timothy Bottoms has nothing to do but take up with the coach's wife and hold the chains at the football games. Sam the Lion is dead already, and we don't even get to see him die, but we know he was the lost love of Shepherd's mother, as they rode their horses across the tank many years ago. If you can watch Ellen Burstyn recounting this to Bottoms and not get a chill, then I don't want you in my house. I'm the one who gave him the name, 'Sam the Lion. The thought goes through the mind that perhaps Sam rode off to help Captain Brittles with a little scouting.

It follows three high school teenagers--Sonny Crawford (Timothy Bottoms), Duane Jackson (Jeff Bridges) and Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd)--from their senior year to a few years after.Some people said this is like a soap opera. That is true, but it's a GOOD realistic soap opera. The script is just wonderful (Larry McMurty adapted from his book along with director Peter Bogdanovich) and the characters are like real people. It deals with all three of them coming of age, their first sexual encounters (all of which are played awkwardly--as they should) and dealing with a dying town. It's (appropriately) filmed in beautiful black and white--the cinematography by Robert Surtees is exceptional--it brings the whole film to life. This would never have worked in color.The acting varies. Bottoms, Bridges and Shepherd are just OK--but that's understandable. It was one of Bridges' first films, it was Bottoms' second and Shepherds' first! They were all still learning. Everyone else though is great. Ben Johnson as Sam the Lion is just wonderful and won a Best Supporting Actor for this. Cloris Leachman is heart-breaking in her role and won Best Supporting Actress. Ellen Burstyn has the best lines and is also very good (and was nominated for Best Supporting Actress also) as Cybill's mother. And Timothy Bottoms' brother (Sam Bottoms) has a small part as Billy. It works in the films favor--Sonny and Billy are supposed to be best friends and the affection the two brothers had for each other comes through on the screen. I'm giving this a 10. It's just great--I didn't want it to end. But it is VERY depressing. You probably won't notice until the film is over. A must-see.Avoid the commercial TV print--it's cut to ribbons.

Only among them, can you start to sort out which of them are worth using to invent yourselves. To even reach the third level is rare, and if by a youngster, usually generates a hullaballo.I think for the very brief period of this film, Bogdonovich raised himself to the third level. He clearly taps the actors' natural tendencies to project and in a few cases to interact. But that is all we have emotionally committed performances to no end. There's no underlying intelligence here, even in (actually, especially in) the source book.Many of the filmmakers he says he admires eschew `meaning' but that notion is not only deliberate, but reflected in what they do instead. There's no `instead' here -- and I have to report that this simply is not worth your time unless you study actors.I had the remarkable good luck to see this and `Elephant Man' in the same day. They are both exuberant, actor-centric, back and white films that evoke a sense of place and specific mores. They are both by young talents that were for the the first time being `sponsored' and working to find how to work within the system. `Elephant' employed professional actors who, while relatively unknown were highly, highly accomplished. `Picture' uses amateurs and newcomers for the boys and relatively ordinary actresses for the women.I walked away from `Elephant' with images, some of which are worth keeping (as if I had any choice). `Picture' leaves me with recall of a few tightly crafted situations, but this will fade -- flowers versus trees.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4 Has some interesting elements.

That adds a sadness to the story. A sadness about changing times and the new way of life replacing the old way of life. That is a recurring theme in the film. I loved the use of black and white photography, which helps those themes. The film explores many things all teens go through such as exploring their sexuality, keeping friendships intact, graduating high school, and moving on to the next stage of life. The film explores all of those very well. The film is set in a town where everyone knows each other, which in turn enables the viewers to get to know the characters better.Peter Bogdanovich's film has a plot that is hard to describe, other than to say it is about growing up in a town that weeps of the past. Sonny Crawford is the main character here. He was a co-captain of his football team along with his best friend Duane. Sonny just broke up with his rather tasteless girl, while Duane dates the hottest girl in town. Sonny enters an affair with the middle-aged wife of the football coach, thus showing how far this town can get you.The film has many fine actors in it. Timothy Bottoms does an underrated job as Sonny. I really loved Jeff Bridge's performance as Duane, the guy who seems to have it all. Other performances to keep an eye on are Ben Johnson as the fatherly figure and most important man in town, Sam the Lion. And Cloris Leachman as Ruth, the wife Sonny has an affair with. She has quite a few powerful scenes.Overall, The Last Picture Show is a better film than I expected. A beautiful, poignant film about the pains of growing up. The tone is often bitter and sad. We don't often see happiness in the picture, from beginning to end. But we see our characters make most of their lives and that is what matters. All of the sad moments or in other words, the realism influence just how powerful this movie is, set against the 1950's Texas background. There are many great scenes, but I loved the funny scene involving running away from Texas just to head to Kansas. If you want a movie about growing up, this should be your first film to watch.My Grade A "},{"Title":"Peter Bogdanovich's Masterpiece","Date":"6 March 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Director Peter Bogdanovich scored a bullseye with The Last Picture Show, a lilting and atmospheric coming-of-age drama that follows several disparate characters in a tiny hamlet in Texas during the 1950's that is so small that the town only has one movie theater and it shows the same movie for months on end.Larry McMurtry's eloquent screenplay's primary focus is on a pair of high school buddies, Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) who find their relationship coming to a fork as they prepare to graduate from high school and both have feelings for the town tramp, Jacy (Cybill Shepherd). Jacy eventually chooses Duane and Sonny then actually drifts into an affair with the lonely wife of his football coach (Cloris Leachman).Filmed in beautiful black and white, this movie evokes a period feeling and teenage sexual awakenings better than just about any film that came out of the 70's. Bogdanovich pulled rich performances from his cast with Bottoms giving a star-making performance as Sonny, Ben Johnson won a Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Sam the Lion, the local businessman who pretty much runs the town and Leachman won supporting actress, though, personally, I think that award should have gone to Ellen Burstyn, who is just luminous as Jacy's mother.A beautiful and lovely drama that will entertain and haunt.

Timothy Bottoms as Sonny is Everyguy, a boy entering young Manhood and hoping and wanting something BETTER out of Life. His final scene, which dissolves oh-so-slowly into a shot of the dust-choked main street of town, where the camera pans to a last, lingering shot of the Royal (the town theater, now closed due to the death of owner Ben Johnson), is quite beautiful.

It has a lot of good separate story lines weaving around in this town. There are some very memorable scenes. It is a little too slow at times.

If you read the novel, almost every piece of dialogue and direction is included. There are only two noticeable additions or deletions. Of course, some will say that any film based upon a novel will owe much to the writer, but, in this case, it is so much. I am not knocking Bogdanovitch, although his very modest record since making T.L.P.S. might lead one to think that he got lucky with it. He was lucky but didn't seem to know it and this led to an inflated belief in his own genius and a string of flops. The film is a classic and it is somewhat irrelevant who is chiefly responsible for its success. Film making is a collaborative art form and sometimes it simply catches lightning in a bottle - Picture Show certainly does that. But you can't work magic from nothing. In my opinion, McMurtry provided Bogdanovitch with as much as any director might need in creating an American cinema classic.

I'd seen bits of Picture show, but never watched from the opening shot of the abandoned movie theater to the closing shot of that selfsame theater - I think I avoided mainly just because I find Bogdanovich an insufferable filmmaker other than his first hurrah, Targets (in which he co-starred with Boris Karloff), another film framed by a movie theater (in that case a drive-in).Must admit Picture Show is a fairly brilliant work, and I didn't realize he did it in black and white at a time when 95 percent of new movies were in color. Nice way to pay homage to the fading world it depicted! Having all the music be heard via on screen players (radio, turntable, etc) was a nice touch, as well as a cool way to personalize a sound to fit each character's personality.Bogdanovich may be the most irritating twit in Hollywood (no small feat!), what with the stupid ascot and indoor shades, not to mention getting Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratton killed by her husband by moving her into the bedroom of his Bogdanomansion, but I must confess he made at least two fantastic films Targets and this one.

All the major characters in the film are finely etched, people you really get to know and understand. Shepherd was 21 when The Last Picture Show was made, as beautiful as the sexy heart-breaker she portrays. She was a star from the first moment she appeared on the screen. Leachman, Burstyn and Brennan were at the height of their powers which were considerable. Bottoms and Bridges, high school buddies and townies, handled their roles convincingly. A lesser known actor, Ben Johnson, played Sam the Lion, owner of the local pool hall, the movie house and the burger joint -- and a very important figure in the film.Forty years later, it is still worth seeing.

And more sex...In 1951 Anarene, Texas, there's not much to do except be an angst-ridden teen and feel up chicks in the dark of the old movie theater. But small town life is crawling to a close, and the teens in THE LAST PICTURE SHOW, like the town of Anarene itself, are thrown into the world with their naïveté on stun and their hormones on kill.The bad economy (isn't it always?) has forced the movie theater to close. Soon there will be a last picture show. And the dull meaningless void beckons. The teens are antsy, drunk, irresponsible; the adults, worn out, cynical, devoid of dreams.From a novel by Larry McMurtry, Peter Bogdanovich co-writes and directs this frank, forward tale of a small community fragmenting as the old guard is replaced with teen beat. With the death of the town's tacit head, Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson), the townsfolk and teens who regarded him a stabilizing force are suddenly rudderless.Duane (volatile Jeff Bridges) and Sonny (soulful Timothy Bottoms) are best friends, high school graduates gawping at the threshold of life without a clue. Jacy (Cybill Shepherd) is the teen tease every boy lusts after - she's Duane's girl, but has no qualms in cozying up to a rich college boy to further her prospects.Shepherd plays Jacy with a callousness that prompted the invention of the c-word; using sex academically, as a weapon. She accepts an invitation by Randy Quaid (so young he looks like little brother Dennis) to a pool party only to get closer to the rich boy; on this same night, Duane gives her a watch bought with six months savings, which she callously takes off - along with her clothes - and dives naked into the pool for the rich boy. Rich boy tells her Come see me when you're not a virgin, so she deflowers herself dutifully with Duane (who adopts the studly strut - until he realizes she was only prepping herself for the richie).Meanwhile, MILF Ruth (Cloris Leachman) cozies up to teen Sonny while her husband Coach Popper is at school coaching Sonny's basketball team. Back when Cloris Leachman was only in her 40s, she was surprisingly svelte and sexy, yet it wasn't from her cardboard emotionlessness or pointy bra - it was her sexual forthrightness, openly seducing Sonny with a frankness that we don't see in modern American cinema.When Jacy eventually elopes with Sonny she doesn't allow him to touch her in the car on the way to their honeymoon; as with all her relations it is purely academic, simply so she wouldn't be an old maid in a small town. When they are caught and she is forced away from him, it is not the usual tearful rending of two lovers; she gives him an ambivalent look, gets into another car and doesn't look back as it drives off.Then - Clu Gulager, renowned C-actor and bane of MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000, boyfriend to Jacy's mother (Ellen Burstyn, also looking young and MILF-y), seduces Jacy on a pool table, who acquiesces with nary a movement.No such thing as foreplay in this town, which is a refreshing change from all those mid-Americana teen movies where kids spend endless hours necking necking necking. Yet there is also dearth of emotion. Bogdanovich is intent on showing us how clinical, uncomfortable and embarrassing sex is, almost an unnatural act with its participants autonomously going through motions without knowing why.And on the opposite side of the life-creating act, there is death. Tragedy must necessarily dog a town on the threshold of change. Or does this much shtupping. And Bogdanovich pours out the tragedy in equal amounts.THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is the reality that happens after the cameras stop rolling on any given episode of HAPPY DAYS.

The film is really a winner for it's realism and truthfulness that has occurred with so many small towns in America I for one know because being from a small town saw the changes of how things drift from people moving away to the old timers passing away and seeing how love relationships come and go. Many may say this film is not their style as they feel put off for it being set in a small town, and many feel the film is controversial as they think it in ways was a sexual exploration film. And true in many ways for 1971 director Peter Bogdanovich did push the envelope with many of the scenes by showing frontal skin nudity. Still so much more can be taken and learned from this acclaimed social drama that's direct and outspoken.The time and place is 1951 in the small town of Anarene, Texas and this film was adapted from a screenplay by author Larry McMurtry(who's the king of Texas literary stories that get made into hit films, exBrokeback Mountain and Terms of Endearment). As in many ways aside from this being a film of social change it's a good film of character study as the film focuses mainly on the towns youth. And as you see in many of the scenes from the old country store, to high school athletic games, and parties this reminds anyone who grew up in a small town just what it was like as they see so clearly in the scenes. The most bittersweet themes touched upon in the film are the times we most remember of peer pressure the way it related to love. As the films take on sex from having sex the first time to one night stands and having an affair with an older woman was displayed in such a blunt frank manner. As all of us dealt with those issues growing up being in a small town as most of it was discovered for escapism. Most important this social classic teaches us that nothing last forever in a small town still memories will last forever.The cast is star struck and talented with good turns from Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms and veterans Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson, and Ellen Burstyn give good supporting performances. The most notable standout was the introduction of the stunning and smooth beauty Cybill Shepherd as her scenes of skin are very memorable and her character as the all American girl can have any viewer think back to a girl of that kind that they knew in high school. Overall the Last Picture Show in my opinion is a film that's a treasured classic for it's realism that in ways was ahead of it's time as anyone knows being from a small town the drifting changes that takes place among people and the community and escapism is many times the only hope. Mainly the escape is found thru memories and love with friendship yet this film took the theme of sex and used it as an escape tool for small town America which really pushed the envelope the way it showed it in 1971 still that was one element that made this an unforgettable classic gem.

Set in a shriveled-up Texas town in the early 1950s, filmed in black and white with a soundtrack of Hank Williams songs, and featuring homages to old John Wayne and Spencer Tracy movies, there were few hints that the movie contained some of the raciest content possible in a mainstream release. Which is not to say that its content was entirely new or cutting-edge; the bleaker and more mature Hud (1963, also based on a McMurtry novel) had shown a boy's coming-of-age in a dysfunctional, dying Texas town, and the more fashionable The Graduate (1967) had depicted a multi-generational love affair involving a younger man and an older woman. What The Last Picture Show brings to its treatment of these themes is a larger, more diverse cast of characters who each embody a different facet of the community. Some are unsatisfying archetypes and ciphers, like Ben Johnson's Sam the Lion, and Billy, a mentally- disabled child. Most, though, are sufficiently complicated and believable, particularly the women played by Chloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Cybill Shepherd. Shepherd had no previous acting experience, but carries much of the movie on her shoulders and nails all of the big and little things about her character.

Actually, it was fun hearing songs of my youth once more, especially long forgotten novelty tunes like The Thing and It's in the Book. I'd forgotten about grandma's Lysol that cures about anything when applied behind the ears.All in all, the movie's a beautifully observed elegy on a dying Texas town bypassed by post-war America. The town itself is a dusty husk, almost like an abandoned movie set, except it's not. Worse, there's no sense of future for the youth of the town. In fact there's very little to do except make-out and go to the movies. Of course, the girls won't go all the way without a wedding ring, which accounts for the many hasty marriages that don't appear to work out well. So that leaves the guys basically two choices&#x97; rush hormonally into married life or join the military. On the other hand, the girls have no choice at all. Hardly, it appears, is this a valentine to 1950's small town America.The screenplay spreads the dynamic over two or three intersecting stories. In the hands of lesser filmmakers the material could easily have descended into teary or titillating soap opera. However, Bogdanovich and McMurtry manage to capture an odd visual and emotional poetry from the damaged lives, thanks in part to exceptionally sensitive performances from Bottoms, Johnson, and Leachman. As things turn out, it's their three characters who are deepened emotionally despite the many dispiriting influences surrounding them. I suspect it's no accident that the most superficial of the lead characters Jacy (Shepherd) migrates to the city instead of reaching out for real relationships. There's a feeling that no matter where she goes, she'll end up like her mom, unhappy. I guess if there's a moral to the stories, it's something about emotional hurt being the necessary price for personal growth.Anyway, in my book, the movie's richly deserving of its many awards. Despite the 2- hour run-time and a general lack of action, I was never bored. Also, kudos to the filmmakers who filmed in gritty b&w and refused to prettify anything, while at the same time, capturing a level of rural life that Hollywood seldom bothers with. Meanwhile, I'm off to buy a box of Lysol to see if it still works.

The timeless isolation of the American West has rarely been more vivid that sense of lonely, desperate lives caught in a limbo of suspended decay, victims of terminal boredom and frustrated libidos. Sometimes it seems as if the only action in town is motivated by raging hormones, but the more each character yearns after gratification the more they find only heartache and pain.The screenplay (co-written by Larry McMurtry from his own novel) is relentlessly downbeat, and made to seem even darker by director Peter Bogdanovich's inspired decision to shoot the film in black and white (something almost unheard of in American movies at the time). The often stark photography by ace cinematographer Bruce Surtees removes all the joy and artifice from the setting, leaving only a bittersweet feeling of alienation and loss.

It's small in the details, it plays hard with nuance to the point of losing any sense of plot, and ends up creating better than almost any film of this type, a place and time, the whole mise-en-scene. Director Peter Bogdanovich, often now seen as a film commentator on DVD extras, is a real film devotee, a scholar but also an insider with a feel for the movies. And he has made several remarkable films, some of which do nothing for me, like At Long Last Love, and at least one other masterpiece, also in black and white, Paper Moon. At his best his films are both penetrating and oddly weightless, in the sense that they keep you floating through an imagined world without apparent effort. They are virtuosic without seeming virtuosic.You'll never doubt anyone here, their motives, their inner viability. And you won't question that this place exists, this small, wide street town with almost no one left, a true ghost town in the making. The cast is made of known but not famous actors, and as you watch you appreciate how beautifully, and with what fluidity, they are pulled together. The cameraman is Robert Surtees, a veteran from the 1940s and 50s, and who had recently pulled off the astonishing photography in The Graduate. You can feel the influence of all of Bogdanovich's film-loving, film-going days, and his deep friendship with Orson Welles. Most of all, The Last Picture Show feels relevant. It's a metaphor about finding meaning amidst futility, about the escape from troubles and confronting them, about superficial beauty and the real thing, about sex in a way that seems appropriate for the period (the early 1950s), and about community in the that Spoon River Anthology kind of interwoven way. Remarkable on every score.Does all this make for a compelling experience? Do we normally want to sit and watch life go by and a parade of different characters, none of them heroic, none of them criminal, none of them especially singular in a cinematic way? Maybe. It depends if you're the type to take the window seat in a diner, or a bench in the park, or the corner of a busy room, and people watch. You can't participate, but you can pay attention. And watch, and watch again. "},{"Title":"You didn't even have the decency to even wash his face","Date":"4 June 2010","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Amazing film!

There's always some void in our lives that we can't fill ourselves, and this is what every character in the movie has.  This movie is one of the most shocking movies I've ever seen, as far as the nudity goes, that is.  The cast is great.  Cybil Sheppard, Timmothy Bottoms, and Jeff Bridges terrificly portray the leading roles, but it's the supporting cast that makes this movie worth watching.  Ben Johnson is very compelling as Sam the Lion, and really turned in an Oscar-worthy performance.  However, the standout performances in this film are the three supporting actresses Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn, and Eileen Brennan.  Cloris Leachmen will have your heart by the end of the film, especially with that last scene in the movie.  Her portrayal of an aging, lonely woman could bring someone to tears.  There's no doubt that she deserved her oscar.  Ellen Burstyn, who's character is not as heartbreaking, is just as good as the alcoholic mother of Jacy, but she's very funny, too.  I'm surprised she got an oscar and golden globe nominations since her onscreen time was so little, though she was very effective in the car scene with Timmothy Bottoms after they get back into town.  Eileen Brennan couldn't get any better.  She really does seem like a waitress.  Her character, like Burstyn's character, was heavily underwritten.  She really saw the townspeople for what they were.  She portrays the character as one who tells people off sometimes, but makes it noticable that she truly cares for them.  The writing and directing matches the talent of the actors.

I certainly recall this film spoken of in high terms by those wealthy enough to see all the new films.And I always thought I would enjoy it. I just recently got a chance to watch it.I knew it would be about small town life, and be a drama. The photograph of the swimming scene where some beautiful nude people are supposed to tease a plain but young girl into stripping. That was the only image most of us ever saw. Later on, this plain young girl would develop as a very sexy mature actress. And even then, she had a good body.So I found it in the library, and checked it out.I probably expected too much. Still, it was very disappointing.It was full of all the clichés and stereotypes of the early seventies.Kids grown up in a small Texas town near the start of the Korean War.The performances and production are top notch. It reminds me very much of what was very common, and still is. Poor script with lots of money spent on it, because directors like to prove a point.The biggest trouble with the story is that everyone seems to be the same person, and the person doesn't ring true. It's more like a narrator saying every person is him (or her), unless the person is not to be trusted.A huge trouble with this movie, which will ultimately put it in the waste cans in an hundred years, when the self righteous ones who push this movie down other people's throats are finally gone, is that it doesn't even come cloe to a realistic depiction of small town life. I wasn't around in the early 1940s, but did live a town of about 3000 in the late sixties and early seventies, fifth through twelfth grade, and this was nothing like real life, especially with the characters. The characters in the movie all come across as very civil to each other, like a happy family, and that's a pipe dream. Not a single believable scene in the entire movie. Very disappointing.The movie is very predictable, even for 1971. It also lacks coherence for the first half. We don't know who is who, or what they are doing. It is confusing and looks botched.Sometimes confusion is good, or okay, but since this is a drama, a story, it comes across as poor directing and/or writing, which it is.The story is just a poor story. The only ones who seem to have any soul at all are the ones who are called slow or retarded. The others all come across as people who think they are in a seventies movie, which looks goofy since they live in the early fifties.The movie is made with a lot of hatred, and makes great pains to contrive things to look like nothing abnormal happens, almost like a writer is contriving a story to show there is no god, but in doing so makes it so barren that only a divine spirit could possibly make it so barren. Like a pair of dice that are rolled a thousand times and never come up 7.It looks like an atheist preaching a sermon, which of course means it will be loved by the American public, but it is lame.I give 3 to movies that aren't bad, but just bore me to sleep. This one came close, but not quite, so it rated a 4.Too bad, because a film about nostalgic eras, about small town life, should have been much better. We're given the huge quantity here of a big budget, mostly good acting, small details paid attention to, but no quality of writing or directing. Typical seventies preaching.Mildly disappointing. Perhaps, if you expect the worst, you may be a bit more pleasantly surprised. Mediocre, by any standard.

Last Picture Show may be the most tedious all.Take away the wide-screen and Robert Surtees's competent but inexpressive b&w photography and Last Picture Show exhibits all the style of an ABC Movie of the Week, circa 1968. John Ford, Howard Hawks, or Orson Welles this is not. Bogdanovich has no sense of camera placement, blocking, or spacial dynamics within a shot, and his cutting wouldn't pass muster in a Hal Roach short circa 1921. Horrible big head of Pola reaction shots are cut into every scene for no apparent reason, other than to get Bogdanovich out of the master. Cybill Shepard's big strip scene at the pool party is a prime example of directorial ineptitude Bogdanovich seems to have had one or two shots of Shepard, a couple of badly posed reaction shots of the nude skinny-dippers watching her remove her clothing, and a medium-close shot of Shepard fumbling with her bra clasp. This paltry footage is then cut together with no sense of drama, suspense, anticipation, eroticism, or any thing else for that matter, and goes on forever. I ended up laughing far harder at this sequence than at anything in What's Up Doc?. Hitch and Ford could get away with shooting cleanly, simply, and with little coverage because they knew what they were doing, and how to get maximum expressiveness out of minimal footage; Bogdanovich, clearly, does not.Most of the acting is good, and some of it is terrific the Bottoms brothers, Ben Johnson, just about all of the women. Johnson, giving an excellent performance is, unfortunately, not helped by Bogdanovich and writer Larry McMurtry's penchant for hanging a figurative vote for me sign around his neck during his big dramatic scenes, which had the effect of taking me right out of the movie.Cybill Shepard is, of course, a stump.There is lots of nudity and sex, but no eroticism; all the sex is bad sex, and bad bad sex at that. The sex scenes play like a virgin's idea of what bad teen sex would be like, if you understand my meaning. Typically, once he found success, Bogdanovich dumped his incredibly talented wife, Polly Platt, who later worked successfully with Robert Altman, James Brooks, Louis Malle and others, for the sublimely untalented Shepard. Fittingly, his career then nosedived after a string of cinematic atrocities such as Daisy Miller and At Long Last Love.

Even a young Bridges, already showed so much great talent here, as a rebel town kid, Duane, best friends with Bottoms, who is a lighter natured boy.

Her timidity in the skinning dipping scene with a young randy, Randy Quaid, another acting asset as Lester, the town clown, is so cute. Set at the start of the good 'ol seventies, we follow the lives of these late teens, going through the normal changes in their life and passing into manhood, where they're a lot of moments we familiarize with reality. Times are getting tougher, the picture theatre closing down for one thing, where Duane ends going in the army, and an older Cloris Leachman becomes a sort of Mrs Robinson to a young Bottoms, after her husband Sam The Lion (Ben Johnson) passes, which I must say was a turning point.

The hottest member of the cast is the blond pretty and still a virgin, but not for long, Jacy Farrow played by Cybill Shephard in her debut film role. Jacy who unlike her free living and swinging mom Lois tries to keep her virginity intact until her wedding night but with the horny crowd of males in town that's, as it soon turned out, almost next to impossible. It's the handsomest and most popular guy in town Duane Jackson, Jeff Bridges, who first catches Jacy's eye but when the two got down to business in a local motel room Daune in coming up short,by not quite measuring up for the task at hand, proved that he wasn't the stud that Jacy thought he at first was. Feeling both hurt and disappointed,you can just imagine how Duane felt, Jacy dumped Duane like a sack of horse manure over a Nebraskan cornfield. Duane did in fact redeemed himself later when he got a second chance with Jacy but by then she now having experienced sex was looking for someone better and more on the ball. In no time at all, in her wanting to make up lost time, Jacy cast her eyes on Duane's good friend the very introverted, with girls, Sonny Crawford, Timothy Bottoms. Sonny's a man of few words and even fewer sexual experiences; All this sex going on around in town just bored the living hell out of him . That all lead to a fireworks display or explosion with Sonny getting his head based in with a beer bottle when Duane found out that his best friend who always liked to keep to himself was in fact fooling around with his girl Jacy.There's also in the film middle age lonely and ignored, by her high school macho football coach husband Bill Truman, Ruth Popper, Cloris Leachman, who gets the very confused, in what he's supposed to be doing in the movie, Sonny Crawford to start up a hot and heavy affair with her that builds up Sonny's confidence in making it with the opposite sex. But the on and off affair soon turns out to be a total disaster for Ruth in Sonny treating her like a sex toy instead as an equal partner in and out of bed.The film goes on and on with everyones hang ups in town brought out in the open until Duane in him trying to get away from it all, the craziness going on in Anarene, joins or is drafted into the US Army and then slated to be shipped off to fight the dirty rotten Commies in Korea. ***SPOILERS**** In a touching farewell scene between Duane and Sonny,now back as the best of friends, with Duane handing Sonny over the keys to his band new Mercury tragedy strikes again with Sonny's kid brother the mute and mentally challenged Billy, Sam Bottom's, getting hit and killed by a cattle truck as he was sweeping up the town's garbage! The movie ends more or less like it began minus Ben, who's dead, Jacy, who went to collage in Kansas, and Duane, who shipped off to Korea to fight the Commies, with only Sonny left to pick up the ball and keep the show going. But by then there's almost no one left in town for him to play with.

Its sparse, barren ambiance and coincidentally occurring simultaneous story lines can be found nearly equaled in the lighter, frothier George Lucas classic American Graffiti just two years later in 1973. The setting of a restrictive, if not dying home town is unmistakable. The ingenious technique of incidental music was lifted intact and Lucas, bizarrely, is often credited as its originator. I was amused at the similarities I found in David Lynch's stunningly disturbing first feature, Eraserhead. Its odd rhythms and anachronistic use of black and white are direct quotes of Bogdanovich's offbeat western. And more recently, speaking of offbeat westerns, PT Anderson's remarkable There Will be Blood owes more than a casual thanks to Peter. The curiously intimate yet somehow startlingly remote feel of all the relationships in both can not be mere coincidence. And, at the risk of sounding paranoid, or delusional, I even attribute much of Scorsese's towering triumph,Raging Bull, directly to The Last Picture Show's gritty realism, natural character speak, and intentionally voyeuristic perspective. Marty merely substitutes extreme violence for Peter's awkward sexuality.And going the other way, TLPS bares its pedigree fairly openly, giving a big nod to such genre defining picts as 1963's Hud, with its bitter disillusioned inhabitants, or 1956's John Wayne revenge classic The Searchers. That one might be a stretch for some, but I found the iconic desolate imagery of Monument Valley echoed in the feeble but equally iconic profile of ancient, desiccated 1951's Anarene, Texas. It's a man made monument to slim chances and existential futility. This attribution is made sensible when you remember that TLPS's writer, Larry McMurtry, was a huge fan of John Ford, and The Searchers stands out as a particularly bleak example of his sublime talent.So, if you're fond of tracking lineages and progeny, The Last Picture Show is a rich vein that can be mined for a couple more generations. It's open, vague narrative style and coolly detached demeanor can serve as worthwhile instructions for so many of today's overly earnest, hyperactive, exceedingly self involved, absurdly myopic movie makers. There's always been a shortage of truly original vision in Hollywood - it gets immediately diluted and corrupted - so paying your respects to the few genuinely fine examples we have is no crime. More people should steal from this extraordinary film, if that's what it takes to achieve anything worth my time.

Set in Texas during the 1950s, the film takes a look at a small dying town and the lives that make up the boring lives there. You have Sonny (Timothy Bottoms) who gets mixed up with a married woman (Oscar-winner Cloris Leachman) and Duane (Jeff Bridges) who keeps trying for the woman (Cybill Shepherd) he loves but instead just finds one heartache after another. As the town slowly dies these two men start to realize that there might really not be too much to their lives. It's said that Bogdanovich decided to make this film in B&W due to the suggestion by his friend Orson Welles and when watching the film you can't help but see the young director showing what he had learned from those masters who came before him. This includes Welles and of course John Ford. These two men have their footprints throughout this incredibly well-written and superbly acted drama that ranks as one of the best of its kind. The beautiful B&W cinematography really becomes an additional character because it perfectly sets the mood and atmosphere in the picture. It's as if you really can feel this town dying as well as the people who live in it. This certainly isn't a very pleasant movie to watch but what makes it so effective is how raw and powerful it is. Bogdanovich's screenplay is perfect as the characters are all given some wonderful development and you can't help but feel as if you know each one of them by the time the movie is over. Each one of the characters are so fully written that you almost feel as if each character is the star of the picture. You have the terrific Bottoms character who gets in over his head not knowing how to deal with emotions. You have Oscar-winner Ben Johnson as the wise old man trying to old onto the past. The Leachman character is perhaps the most depressing because she's trying to recapture something she's lost. Even the Shepherd character and her mother (Ellen Burstyn) are quite remarkable. All of the actors give superb performances and you can't help but applaud the entire cast. You also have to give the director and producers credit for perfectly matching up all the roles as they certainly got one of the most impressive young casts out there. The mix of new faces and veterans really paid off in the end. Add in the terrific soundtrack full of Hank Williams songs and you've really got something special. THE LAST PICTURE SHOW was daring when it was first released and that raw and fresh appeal is still on display all these years later.

The Last Picture Show was only Peter Bogdanovich's second directorial achievement, which won critical raves so filled with exaltation that it immediately put the noses of his competitors and counterparts out of joint (Bogdanovich was nominated for a Best Director Oscar, but lost). This adaptation of Larry McMurtry's novel, by McMurtry and Bogdanovich, is an unblushing look at randy, impatient young people and their elders, most of whom are living in the past. It has a somewhat cynical eye (often for a comedic affect), but also an intimate spirit and a dazzle that sweeps the audience up. You can't help but be moved by it, with those rich, warm echoes of Hank Williams songs on the radio and screen-doors squawking in the dusty wind.

Both new owners remain clueless on making quality pictures; and eventually made Spiderman, the greatest negative force in movies in 20 years. Sure, I enjoyed Spidy; but in the aftermath the coke sniffers of Hollywood dumbed-down their movies into a steady output of stupid and pointless comic book films.

It was one of the best I'd ever seen. In color, it would have been a completely different experience. Jump forward more than 30 years and something is wrong. Either the transfer to DVD cannot bring us the fine tones of the original, or the original had degraded over time. I realize that it may be impossible to see it in its full glory because of technical limitations. However, the image I see now is worse than that of most of the B&W movies I've seen transferred to DVD from any era. It should be much better than it is here. So, in that respect, I was disappointed, as were others I had spoken with who had also seen the original screenings. I do hope Bogdanovich or someone else will consider a restored release some day. Otherwise, most of you will never experience what can be done with the extraordinary dimension and depth found in fine B&W by a master like Robert Surtees.However, the story and most of the acting is as fresh as ever. Aside from Cybill Shepherd, who, unfortunately, appears to have been cast only because she was the babe of the times, Cloris Leachman's gripping performance is a reason to see this movie.

William Friedkin re-invented action films with The French Connection (the film's car chase still remembered), and controversial films from Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs to Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange broke all the rules. It is fitting to start then, by saying that the year was one for the young directors. After all, this was the year that Coppola began work on The Godfather, Friedkin won his Oscar, and Bogdanovich broke out with his masterpiece, The Last Picture Show.Had he not had the freedom to make such a film, director Peter Bogdanovich would never have set out to make such a film based on a novel written in the 60's. The film itself barely escaped with a normal rating. After all the scene in the pool showed much more then the rape scene in Straw Dogs, but it was all done with such a happy demeanor, nothing in here ever goes as far as to break the rules despite the nudity and colorful language.The film, written by Larry McMurty (who also wrote the novel), stars Timothy Bottoms as Sonny and Jeff Bridges as Duane. Both live in a dying town near Texas, and their lives are vividly shown as they survive through broken relationships and the death of a good friend. Both actors give amazing performances, and they are helped by an outstanding supporting cast that includes Cybill Shepherd, Ben Johnson, and Ellen Burnstyn.I really can't say anything more other then the fact that you should definitely watch this.

Nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, the film is a gritty character study focusing on seven or so lead characters trying to find their true selves amongst the rigidity of the pretend idealism that ran rampant in the 1950s. Filmed in grainy back-and-white, with intentionally harsh contrast, Bogdanovitch never romanticizes nor judges his subjects. He simply allows views to enter their world, and share the pain, enjoyment, and frustration that they experience.The entire ensemble is terrific, especially supporting actor Oscar winners Cloris Leachman as the lonely wife of the homosexual high school basketball coach and Ben Johnson as the town patriarch known as Sam the lion. Academy Award nominations were also deservedly handed out to Jeff Bridges and Ellen Burstyn (both of turn in some of the best work of their highly-acclaimed careers), and the non-nominated actors Cybill Shepherd, Eileen Brennan, and especially the heart-breaking Timothy Bottoms are also no less than brilliant. The entire cast, both major and minor players, weave their craft flawlessly in this searing motion picture that deftly exposes the tangle of hypocrisies, fear, and bitterness that often underlie extreme conservatism.

The film is an illustration of life in small-town America of the 1950s. The film also examines the rise of capitalist dominance and the demise of American simplicity.The breakdown of the American family is one of the principal motifs of the film. The affair with the coach's wife exemplifies this theme. The coach was working many hours and not spending enough time with his wife, therefore she found it necessary to seek out another sexual partner to satisfy her desires.Another metaphor may be interpreted with Jacy's relationship with Duane. She is encouraged by her family to abandon that relationship for one Billy, a boy from a more affluent family. I saw this as a metaphor for the rise of cutthroat capitalism, quality being sacrificed for greater profits.One of the most compelling quotes was at the end of the film, when one of the cinema employees comments that the popularity of the picture show is declining in favor of television. This is a commentary not only on the decline of great Hollywood films, but also American entertainment itself. I believe the director, as well as Larry McMurty, wanted to comment on the demise of the content of American entertainment. In today's entertainment we see much more violent, sexual and generally immoral content. I believe that this quote and the film and general served to protest against that trend.

While not an actress (characters are beyond her), she is always a pleasing personality on screen. An ex beauty queen that doesn't take herself too seriously.There is no real need for the nudity and besides, it cuts across the values of the times. Have you ever met a teenage girl who would take their clothes off in front of children (the staring boy doesn't even have pubic hair!) on a diving board?

The early 1970s produced real movies like this one, Bob Rafelson's The King of Marvin Gardens, Five Easy Pieces, Carnal Knowledge.  They were heavy for their time, but if watched recently one wonders whatever were we & they thinking?  They just don't hold up that well.  Still, the scene with Sybill Shepard emerging naked from the swimming pool still gets my heart pumping.  Ben Johnson's portrayal of Sam the Lion is among his best work.Are audiences are more jaded and find it harder to access the simpler life of west Texas?  I just wish the movie had been a little less stylized and a bit longer on story.

Slightly sentimental, slightly European, this movie about life in small-town Texas in the 1950s has excellent performances. Ellen Burstyn, Jeff Bridges, Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson are all fine.Unfortunately, the story of Genevieve (an equally fine Eileen Brennan) the waitress, is not tied up. Why doesn't Sonny turn to her after the demise of his friend? And the sequence of the discovery of the body and the moving of the body is somehow awkward. The subsequent sequence of Sonny's attempt to leave town is made to be awkward as well.I don't really think of these criticisms as spoilers, since I have read them elsewhere.In spite of these flaws, the movie is very engaging and mournful. It ends on a hopeful note, which is a relief.The thing that jumped out at me the last time I saw this movie (on DVD) is Cloris Leachman's very vague suggestion that her husband might be homosexual. The documentary on the DVD confirms that that was exactly the screenwriters' intention.The Last Picture Show is not to be missed.

The acting and writing are superb and the direction is great--no complaints about any of this. However, despite being technically well-done, the film isn't all that pleasant to watch and isn't really appropriate for kids so you might want to think twice before you watch it.First, as for the unpleasantness, most of this was intended by the writer and director. It's all about life in a small god-forsaken town in Texas circa 1951-2. And, while a dead-on look in most ways, it also exposes how dull and awful it would be to live in such a place--at least for modern audiences. To top it off, the film has an omnipresent country music soundtrack that is appropriate to the time and place BUT which will also irritate most modern viewers. Listening to old fashioned country music, to me, is much worse than a film packed with opera or even bluegrass--it's just NOT what my rock-n-roll ears like to hear!! But, there is nothing wrong about this per se--it just doesn't play so well with 21st century audiences.Now as far as the sex goes, the film's themes all seem to revolve around it and EVERYBODY talks about getting laid or you get to see them in the act (and, by the way, it is incredibly brief and poor sex to boot). In addition, there is some full-frontal nudity and so this isn't a film to show granny or the kids.Despite these comments, I did at least admire the film even if I didn't particularly enjoy watching it. When not having sex or running around naked, the characters were exceptionally compelling and well-written. The acting was universally stellar as well--with Timothy Bottoms a particular standout. As far as sets, cinematography and direction go, you can also tell this was a labor of love--they really tried so hard to re-create the era and create a strong sense of nostalgia.

Everyone walks around in a bit of a stupor, emotionally stunted and not really connecting with each other. It is slow and boring, and I never developed any emotional connection with any of the characters. I simply did not care what happened to them. Everyone gets their moment when they speechify to a (usually younger) character about life, love and the meaning of the universe. I really hate that kind of set-speech moment. It's like a glaring spotlight on the character, that is unnatural and annoying. Then again, I didn't like Diner either.

It wasn't until Moonlighting that her career started to come back. I thought the acting was poor rendition of the, Graduate. I have noticed that this movie hasn't been shown in the US.

The movie takes play in a tiny town called Anarene, Texas and takes place between World War 2 and the Korean conflict. Sonny Crawford who is played by Timothy Bottoms is the main character and his best friend Duane Jackson played by actor Jeff Bridges go through the small town as teenagers and go through the ups and downs of normal teenage lives. The two boys played on the local high school team and were the talk of the town, only in the bad sense. Throughout the movie we saw many of the old timers stop the boys and harass them about how bad they were doing. We see when Duane and Sonny are throwing the bag of quarters around the street like their playing football. Then they get stopped in front of a few of these older guys who make fun and poke jokes at them, saying they could catch but couldn't throw a block to save their life.We see Sonny as a young adult struggling to find what he is really looking for, which right now seems to be either love or lust. His coach told him if he drove his wife to the clinic that Sonny could get out of school for a little bit. He ends up by taking her and she offers him back in for a soda. She breaks down right in front of the boy and he is taking back by her emotions and isn't sure what to do. From the start we can see these two people have a physical attraction towards one another. Sonny finds out from her that she isn't really seeing the coach anymore. When this is found out Sonny and her start to have an affair with one another. Each week when Sonny was suppose to be driving her to the clinic, he was actually going over there to make love instead. It reminded me a little of Mrs. Robinson in the move The Graduate. The older more mature woman somewhat takes advantage of the young naive boy.

Instead, I shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film.1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography.2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be, by sharing Cybill Shepherd's (his then-gal) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just on one but on two occasions. Brava! The unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta.3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in America's Deep South (as if it weren't bleedin' obvious) so he hammered that point on and on and on...) How is this an advantage, you might ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired ear-drums, you start experiencing a strange exhilaration The movie's finally over! It's pure joy.4. The movie gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. Hope that they, too, may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even good-looking boyfriend.5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I realize isn't technically a part of TLPS) gives hope to all women that look like that, that they too may one day win a Miss Chicago beauty pageant. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury with.)(You think I'm joking abut Cloris having won a beauty pageant, huh? Well, check out her bio and then we'll see who laughs last...) 6. The movie was shot in black and white which spared us the sight of Cloris Leachman's face in its original, natural non-glory.

What a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered Oscar worthy.I divide material into three levels.  The first is the stage theatre.  Here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and, most importantly, in the power of the writer.  A good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better.  The best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show.The second level is film.  In this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time.  With film, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing.  Furthermore, film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal.The final level is literature.  In this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated onto paper, and then re-imagined by the reader.  Far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio.This is why adaptations can go up, but never down.  Novelizations are never better than the base film (see the dime-per-dozen ones at your local book store), whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book (Catch-22 and LotR).  Movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies.As for 'The Last Picture Show', it fails.  It is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right.  The characters talk the same and act the same, it's pure futility.  Add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film.I saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians.  The instructor raved about how sad the movie was.  What is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious.  Had this been in color the scenes of impotence, the pool party, and the old hooker would be considered great comedy.  Look what Lucas did with 'American Graffiti' a few years later.The American secondary education system needs to start teaching ABOUT film rather than trying to teach WITH film.  Two visually powerful downbeat films Apocalypse Now and Barry Lyndon.  Rely on them, not this.  It's the 'Last' I want to see of it.  1 out of 5.

Did they have some extra film they had to use up and thought that starring at each other would be a good filler? The head shots are just as dated. who shoots that way? why Is bigdogovitch trying to draw our attention to the person in the head shot? They really don't have anything to say to advance the plot.
