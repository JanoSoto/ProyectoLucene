[{"Title":"Our Own Blessed Assurance Of A Beautiful Garden Of Fellowship","Date":"14 August 2007","Score":"38 out of 42 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" When Robert Benton wrote and directed Places in the Heart he created his own Citizen Kane. Like Orson Welles he will spend the rest of his life trying to better it and won't succeed.Places in the Heart takes place in Waxahachie, Texas in 1935 and our director was born there in 1932. The film is a personal vision of his childhood in that small Texas town. It bears a whole lot of resemblance to To Kill a Mockingbird, except that the adult protagonist is not a widower lawyer, but the widowed wife of a sheriff left to fend for herself after her husband is killed.Benton creates his characters with a loving hand, but that does not mean he doesn't see the flaws in the people there, the racism, the sexism, the hypocrisy and the pettiness. Field's husband, Ray Baker, is killed by a drunken black man accidentally. Killing a law enforcement official probably would have gotten him legally executed in any event, but the town administers its own brand of justice to the perpetrator.That being said, it still doesn't solve the problem of a woman who has no education or training to support herself and her family. Sally gets the idea to grow cotton on the few acres her husband left her and gets a pair of strange allies in John Malkovich and Danny Glover to help her.Glover is an itinerant hobo who is the one who if he knows anything knows cotton from his sharecropping background. He's who really holds the family together in the crisis. John Malkovich is a blind man whose brother-in-law is unctuous town banker, Lane Smith, who essentially dumps him on Field because he doesn't want to care for him. Malkovich who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor proves to be a faithful friend.Lindsay Crouse was nominated for Best Supporting Actress as Field's sister. There's a subplot in the film involving her and her philandering husband Ed Harris.Robert Benton won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Best Director and Sally Field won her second Oscar for Places in the Heart. Her character isn't as feisty as her first Oscar winner, Norma Rae, but Edna Spalding certainly has the same grit.Period country and gospel music make up the soundtrack for Places in the Heart. Old line Protestant hymns Blessed Assurance begins the film and In The Garden is the theme for the surreal ending.I can't describe the ending except that it is one of the most beautiful in the history of cinema. It's a vision of what promise we have either in heaven or a utopia we make on earth where the things that divide humankind are washed away and we are in fellowship with each other and our Maker.You have to have a heart of diamond if you are not moved by Places in the Heart.

Who'd have thought a movie could have a coda? The last scene of the movie is so powerful that when I left the theater I literally felt like my breath had been taken away. I suspect the scene is unique in the movies, and it affects me every time I see it. I've shown this film on videotape to friends a few times, and I always whisper, Please don't say anything to me during this last scene. It never fails, though; my friends always begin jabbering away in astonishment right in the middle of the best scene in the movie. It's not a big problem, though.

They are great in their respective supporting roles, sometimes making you laugh, other times wince with pain, other times empathize completely. See where they are now!  The photography and music is perfect, especially the totally appropriate church songs.  Set in a small central Texas town during the Depression, this film shows what a complete lie is perpetuated by Gone With the Wind and its depiction of the happy cotton-picking slaves prior to the Civil War.  Edna Spaulding (Field), who has led a relatively sheltered life until tragedy suddenly strikes and uproots her entire family life as she has known it, must endure what the happy slaves once endured for years.  And the final scene -- well, there is no way to say anything about it to keep from ruining it, other than It comes totally unexpected.  Roger Ebert didn't like it because it didn't fit with the rest of the movie.  I couldn't disagree more.  Roger often misses the point of a movie's ending.  This is one scene that I could watch over and over, and it makes me tear up every time.  At its core is a deeply held spiritual belief that transcends all other concerns.  This is a must see movie!

Somewhat based on director Robert Benton's experiences as a youth in Waxahachie, Texas, the film deals with one woman's (Sally Field in her second Oscar-winning performance) struggle to keep her land, house, and children after her husband is killed in a freak accident.  She decides that the only way to keep her life is to grow and harvest cotton (not the easiest thing in the world to do, especially during the Depression).  Drifter Danny Glover is the catalyst who can bring everything together and the blind John Malkovich (Oscar-nominated) also proves to be an asset.  However, racists threaten to stop Field by eliminating Glover.  On the other side of town Field's sister (Lindsay Crouse, in her Oscar-nominated role) is having troubles with her husband (Ed Harris).  He is having an affair with a local school-teacher (Amy Madigan) and this development could ruin her life just as quickly as Field's life has changed.  Places in the Heart benefits from great performances, but the direction and screenplay are also second-to-none.  An excellent film that was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar in 1984.  5 stars out of 5.

Plus Sally Field and John Malkovich are two of my favourite actors.And it was a good one.  Not once throughout the course of the film did I find myself glancing at the clock in boredom.  It's a remarkable movie from start to finish, although I must admit - the end scene somewhat confuses me.The movie in short, a woman (Sally Field) is widowed and will be forced to sell her farm unless she can pay off the debts her husband left.  The movie is set in 1935, and the woman takes the advice of a Negro traveller (played by Danny Glover) and sows acres of cotton.  She also takes in a blind man (John Malkovich) as a border to make a few extra dollars.  The events which follow are extremely well written, and excellently played by the chosen cast. Sally Field is the perfect choice for the role that she plays, as are Danny Glover and John Malkovich, who is ever so believable as a blind man.I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to others.  If you enjoy heart-warming, touching stories, you'll definitely enjoy this one.

Sally Field is superb in the role of the Depression era Texas widow, Emma Spalding, and deserved her second Oscar which showed that yes, we really do like her. I always love this actress, who is especially compelling in the dramatic Norma Rae and charming in the romantic comedy, Murphy's Romance.The film tells the tale of a good, kind, loving, and strong woman, the widow, Emma (who has been left with with two children to raise on her own) and the pair of disparate characters who help her to literally 'save the farm'...the black drifter, Moze, who plants her cotton, and the intriguing blind border, Mr. Will, that she is forced to take on to appease the nasty banker. Because of mortgage difficulties, Emma's farm and in fact, her life are always in the hands of the local bank manager. The unlikely bond between the trio (Emma, Moze, and Mr. Will) and their shared struggle is always the very heart of the film. There are, however, other local small town characters portrayed here, including a sub-plot revolving around a pair of married folk engaged in an adulterous affair.It's all so much more meaningful than yet another film about a widow's romance. I don't know that the local couple's affair contributes much to the movie, unless, Hollywood style, there just had to be some sexual implications of some sort or other somewhere. Many others seem to agree that this sub-plot is superfluous.The other major roles are well cast, with Danny Glover and John Malkovich sympathetically portraying respectively Moze and Mr. Wills. As for the man involved in the affair, Ed Harris (whom I actually kinda like) always does a brilliant job portraying any sort of somewhat sleazy character!Memorable moments...One moving scene has lingered in my mind all these years, when the newly widowed Emma helps prepare the body of her sheriff husband, Royce, for burial. This is of course so alien to us today, when compared with our modern detached funeral parlors. There is an amazing tornado scene, wonderfully photographed, that brilliantly conveys the terror of the characters seeking shelter. Plenty of high drama there! The movie also has anti-racism themes, with a dramatic scenario involving some local Ku Klux Klan members or equivalent, in which Mr. Will plays a pivotal role. And a fabulous, touching scene where Emma dances at a community shindig with her young son, Frank. I recalled it vividly a few years later during a 'first dance' with my own son.Certainly not an action flick, but a thoughtful, touching, heartwarming story with very sympathetic characters that will engage you and earn a place in YOUR heart. The movie has a quietly dramatic ending some have questioned, but I personally found it perfect. As another reviewer cleverly noted, it 'seals' the film.

When the ending arrives, think about what it means to love and forgive.  Think about people in your life that have left for one reason or another.  Think about where it is that those people that affected you still exist (hence the brilliant title and ending).  When I saw this film in the theater, I was so stunned by the ending that I couldn't speak.  I didn't just cry.  I burst into tears.

During the closing scene, which perplexes some, I literally gasped out loud the first time that I saw it in a theater. At the time, I was writing reviews for an art/music magazine, and the experience was totally unexpected. I went five consecutive nights and took a different friend, parent, or family member each night. We discussed those closing images for months.Every actor excels in accomplishment, even the minor ones, such as Lane Smith as the banker, Jay Patterson as Sheriff Royce Spaulding, and especially Ray Baker as W.E. Simmons, the ever-righteous and arrogant Klan member. These people are as memorable as those we meet and get to know in our own lives, and they stay with us through our lifetimes, just like Charles Foster kane, Elwood P. Dowd, and Scarlett O'Hara, and so many, many important others from the celluloid world. If they handed out Academy Awards for minor roles (why don't they; they give everyone else one?) all three of these actors would have won. Lindsay Crouse was nominated for Best Supporting actress, Sally Fields won Best Actress, and Robert Benton took the prize for Best Screenplay. It was also nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Director, and the Best Picture of the Year.The scene of Edna Spaulding negotiating a price for her cotton with W.E. Simmons, the Klansman, who thinks he will bulldoze the poor widow for some extra profit, is a treasure all in and of itself.The affair, also perplexing and out of place for many commentators, is essential; it truly cements in the viewers eye (and before the eye of the storm crashes in)how the pressure of small town life is closing in around the throat of Amy Madigan's character, Viola Kelsey, a pressure mostly created by her own choices. Her lover, Wayne Lomax (Ed Harris), husband to Edna Spaulding's (Sally Fields) sister (Lindsay Crouse), is just as frustrated, but far more self-destructing and willing to risk it all for what amounts to nothing, even as he dreams about it being more. The film shows the shedding of values and commitments for a little hankypanky that is just as destructive realistically as the tornado or the Klan. Maybe more so, which I think was the point of Benton's adding it as a subplot. Viola may blame the storm for her obsessive desire to get out of town, but the male characters and the audience know better.Each character, such as John Malkovich's obsession with his precious records, has a special something they prize and hold onto, but eventually find valueless in the process of surviving with those around them. Danny Glover's Moze, though, is forced by the Klan to give up the most richly given gift in the movie; friendship and the comfort of a home that he loves, because he has been spiritually loved there.The lethal tornado, outside of themselves and their decisions, is the only real monster in the lives of these good and hardworking Americans. The Depression is just a condition they live with. The bank and the banker (Lane Smith) make life tough while meaning to be helpful, but Edna Spaulding's determination is stronger than a vault of steel. Mother Nature provides the tornado, and the Klan provides the bad guy. Willy, the boy who shoots the sheriff, is actually his friend, or as much of one that a young black person could have been to a white sheriff in 1935 Texas. When he reappears in the communion scene that ends the film, so much is implied by his presence, and that of the deceased husband, that the true value of our lives and the things we share becomes explicit without a single word being said about it. My initial gasp was genuine, audible, and shocking to myself. This film is an artistic achievement rarely matched, and is on a personal list of the top 20 American films ever made. As stated, like any great film, the characters remain with you just like real people you have actually known. There isn't a weak moment of writing or acting in the entire film.

I think this is a film that speaks strongest to those who have either tried to make a living off the land or have/had grandparents or great grandparents who fought to survive on a hardscrabble farm during the Depression. Spending some time in Texas and getting to know the lay of the land probably ups the enjoyment factor, too.Many people have rightly pointed out the superb performances of the leads, but the more I watch this film, the more impressed I am with the performance of Terry O'Quinn, who played Buddy, Viola's husband. I'm so used to seeing him play either psychopaths or hard-charging soldiers or ruthless businessmen that it was a real treat to see him play such a normal character. In his short screen time, he conveyed warmth, tenderness, and concern and made you wish that the secondary story of the affair between Wayne and Viola had been fleshed out so you could understand how two people who had apparently loving spouses could decide to cheat on them--and by extension, their best friends. His performance really sticks with me.I know some people are dismissive of the trio of people who band together as just a handful of cliches, but ask yourself How could it have been written any differently? A drifter HAD to be the one to suggest that Mrs. Spaulding grow cotton. As concerned as friends and loved ones were about her, they not only lacked money to help her, but had seen her as the physically delicate, genteel sheriff's wife for so long that it never would have  occurred to them to suggest she take up farming. A stranger had to point that solution out. If the drifter had been white, the underlying messages about racism and prejudice would have been lost--and the film would have been poorer for it--and some audience members would have been disappointed that the drifter and the widow didn't get together. Because the racial divides of this time and place have already been graphically illustrated, the audience doesn't expect a typical Hollywood foray into a romantic subplot. As for the blind character, he was there because he had nowhere else to go and the way he became a boarder pointed out how under the thumb of anyone who had money and/or power people like Edna were. She didn't want to take in a sightless boarder; she was pressured into it. If he could have seen, he would have been living by himself and the vignette that very powerfully delineated how the bank held Edna's life in its hands would have been lost.I like this film so much, I watch it often--and there's the rub. The more I see it, the more I wish the adultery subplot had been developed; the more I wish minor characters like the dance band leader or the flashy-looking beauty shop customer had been fleshed out. I start to wonder why the sisters laugh when one mentions who made the funeral cake. Was she a notoriously bad cook or a good one that bragged constantly about her baking prowess? The most startling thing I noticed on a recent viewing was how quickly the crux of the film--will back-breaking labor save the farm?--really played out. When we see characters out in the hot sun-- literally crawling on the ground--to get the crop in, I felt like these poor souls had spent months like this. I suddenly realized that it had to be about a week or two. I'm NOT belittling the effort it takes to plant, chop, and pick cotton. I was just a little shocked to figure out how compressed all that exhausting harvesting time was. See what I mean about watching a film too much?I love this film. I'm glad I saw it the first time. I hope to enjoy it as much the tenth or twentieth time I see it. It's a great antidote for those days when I just want to give up because I'm broke and/or have too much to do.

Sally Field gives a powerful, Oscar-winning performance as Edna Spaulding, a wife and mother of two kids who becomes widowed after a drunk accidentally shoots her husband. To make matters worse, she's on the verge of losing her home because of a lack of money to pay off the mortgage. So she decides to make some money by planting cotton. She takes in a very friendly black man (wonderfully played by Danny Glover in one of his early film roles) who helps her get and plant the cotton, and a smart blind man (played by John Malkovich in an Oscar-nominated performance) who's a paying boarder. These three adults and the two children form a little family together, and this is the part of Places in the Heart that works best. There are other characters that add to the story. Lindsey Crouse was also Oscar-nominated for her portrayl of Field's sister who comes to help out after tragedy strikes early on. Ed Harris plays Crouse's husband, who's having an affair with a woman (Amy Madigan, or the real-life Mrs. Ed Harris) who's a close friend of Crouse's. This affair subplot is rather unnecessary and it slows down the momentum a bit. But it's only a minor setback to an otherwise strong film. All the performances are top-notch. Field has never been better. She's the one you can't take your eyes off in this movie. Glover, Malkovich, Crouse, Harris, and Madigan offer great support. Places in the Heart comes from Robert Benton, the same man who made the outstanding 1979 Oscar-winning Best Picture Kramer Vs. Kramer. This movie is based on some of the experiences that Benton went through in real-life during the Depression, and he captures the look of the mid-1930s beautifully. He was honored with the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for Places in the Heart and deservedly so (he was also nominated for Best Director but lost that award). This is a terrific film with strong powerful performances. If only that affair subplot had been taken out, this movie would have been perfect.***1/2 (out of four)   "},{"Title":"Flawed, though exceptionally tender and well-acted","Date":"22 March 2007","Score":"7 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama","Review":" That thudding, metaphorical title not withstanding (thankfully it isn't literal), this is a lovely reminiscence from writer-director Robert Benton, an autobiographical story about a Texas brood during the Depression having to make ends meet after the family patriarch is killed. Sally Field won a well-deserved Oscar as the widow who decides to grow cotton on her land to save her house from being taken by the bank; Danny Glover gives his best performance as a drifter who helps her and John Malkovich is equally good as a blind boarder.

The intoxicated Wiley (De'voreaux White) has been wildly shooting his handgun down at the railroad yard. Unfortunately Wiley shoots Spalding in the abdomen, killing the sheriff. Without waiting for the justice system to take over, some local citizens dispose of Wiley. Edna becomes a young widow who knows little about maintaining her inherited 40-acre barely arable farm. Sensing that she is rather genteel and not used to back-breaking work, her unsympathetic banker Denby (Lane Smith) advises her to sell her land and board her two children somewhere. Then Moze, a Negro drifter, knocks on her door for a handout. But he hangs around doing necessary chores for food and shelter. Now Moze has learned much about cotton farming, and he becomes widow Edna's adviser on how to farm and also make enough money to save her land. Then banker Denby visits with his blind brother-in-law (as a consequence of The Great War), Mr. Will (John Malkovitch); Denby and his wife do not want to be involved with his care anymore. But the banker does propose that Edna take in Mr. Will as a modest paying boarder to help with expenses. She accepts. Over a short time the three adults and two children become like a family that will work hard to make the farm work and to maintain the property. Their bond is quite touching, and we root for them to succeed. There are some eye-opening scenes, like Edna personally preparing her deceased husband's body for showing in her living room and subsequent burial. Apparently that undertaking was typical in the days when funeral parlors were not always accessible. Then there is the bit where cash-strapped Edna cuts out cardboard soles for her son's worn shoes. And the film points out the tremendous work involved in planting, cultivating, and picking cotton. As picking cotton alone leaves bloody fingers, sore legs, and back pain, skilled labor is important. There are also some dramatic moments, like the tornado striking. But secondary stories, like the infidelity of Wayne Lomax (Ed Harris) and teacher Viola Kelsey (Amy Madigan), often detract from the main story-line and add little. We really care more about Edna's situation with her extended family and farm.The leads are sympathetic characters who grow with the movie. Because of wonderful acting, there were several Oscar nominations. Sally Field, very convincing as the determined widow, even won her second Oscar for Best Actress. The pacing and photography are first-rate. Director Benton skillfully grabs the atmosphere of the 1930s (like another movie of the genre, Bound for Glory, 1976). But the utopia-like spiritual (communion scene) ending is not a straight one like the rest of the film. Roger Ebert is correct when he wrote that it is simply not supported by the rest of the story. Then again, the strength of the human spirit is brilliantly portrayed.

The same is true here. He's assembled a good cast, and he stands back and just lets them act. The movie is a like a checklist of every bad thing that could possibly happen to people living on a cotton farm in the 1930s, so we get a big tornado that wipes out the town and a special appearance by the Ku Klux Klan. It's probably authentic but it's also rather grueling. The movie is anchored by Field's fierce performance, and it's her that keeps the potential runaway melodrama in check.The fine cast of at the time mostly unknowns includes John Malkovich as a blind drifter; Danny Glover as a slave; Lindsay Crouse and Ed Harris as Field's sister and brother-in-law.

The other two were, Country with Jessica Lange and The River with Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek.  Places, is the one that sticks solidly in most viewer's minds, if for no other reason than the fact that Sally Field won her second oscar for her role as Edna Spalding.  Having recently posted my comments regarding The River, I dusted off the old vhs copy of Places that I have in my collection, and gave it another viewing.  It had been years since I had seen it and remembered little about it except for ending which, as others have noted, sticks in your mind, but more about that later.All three of these films revolve around the same theme which is trying not to lose the farm with one problem after another cropping up like an acre of cotton.  On top of that, in Places we scenes of racial hatred and adultery, just to be sure there is enough misery for everyone to conquer in the film's almost two hour running time.  Not to worry though, as it moves along from scene to scene at a fast clip, thanks to some good performances, not only by Fields, but everyone involved.In the beginning of the film, Edna's husband Royce (Ray Baker), who is also the town sheriff, is called out to take care of a black kid named Wiley (De'vooreaux White), who is drunk and shooting off a pistol aimlessly.  Frank is accidentally killed by Wylie, and his body is carried home to the now widowed Edna, and their two children Frank and Possum.  In those days, not having any money, you just took care of the body yourself, so in a difficult to watch scene, Edna and her sister Margaret prepare Royce's body for a funeral burial.  Wylie is tied to the back of a truck, dragged along the road till he dies, then dragged up to the front of the Spaulding home.  Then his body is taken out and is given back to Wylie's family and friends by hanging it from a tree for them to cut down.  And that's just in the first fifteen minutes or so of Places In The Heart.Later, Edna meets Moze (Danny Glover), who offers to help her around the farm in exchange for a place to sleep and some food.  She refuses at first, but after Moses steals some silverware from her and is apprehended and brought back, she lies about the stolen silverware to not only save him, but so that he can help her with a cotton crop in order to save the farm.  Shortly thereafter, this Edna is forced to take in a blind man named Mr. Will(John Malkovich) as a border, in order to show good faith to the bank that she will meet her house payment.The majority of the time in the film is spent dealing with Edna along with her two children, Moze's, and Mr. Will, developing a bond of friendship, along with Edna's and Moze's attempt to get their cotton crop planted and harvested.  As in all films of this genre, there are many obstacles that they have to overcome, before we get to a final resolution.As I mentioned earlier, the problem with Places in the Heart, is not the acting.  Everyone involved is terrific, with Fields, Glover, and Malkovich, exceptional as always.  What's wrong with this film is that at times it loses it's focus. It seems to want to be a character study of people triumphing over tragedy, then suddenly it wanders off into a story about racial hatred, and just for good measure it throws in an adultery story with Wayne (Ed Harris), dividing his time between his wife Margret and his already married mistress Viola (Amy Madigan).  It is this subplot that writer/director Robert Benton could easily have left on the cutting room floor.  It's an unnecessary distraction, and seems totally out of place with the rest of the film, doing nothing more than increase the running time.  It's as if Benton wanted to be sure everyone got their moneys worth, or at the very least have time to finish their popcorn and soda.Some of the comments posted here have mentioned the ending which they consider somehow to be intensely moving.  I found it to be quite heavy handed myself, and hurts the film more than helps it as you are left staring at the screen saying HUH?Despite it's faults, Places in the Heart is still worth watching, just to watch the lead actors at the top of their craft.  It is beautifully photographed (but not close to the sumptuous cinematography of The River), nicely paced so it doesn't bog down, has well written characters that we can believe existed in Texas during the depression, and does capture a nice feel for that era. Robert Benton pulls no punches in telling us this story of the American Spirit, but reminds us in the process, that there was also an ugly part of American History, that should never be commended let alone forgotten.  For not pulling any punches in that regard, I admire him.

The film begins and ends in a typical south-mid-west Protestant church in America. Two characters who were killed at the beginning and appear again as the final two figures seen. If you haven't seen the film yet, you won't expect where they show up, and hopefully I won't be accused of offering a spoiler. Endless speculation and debate about their reappearance has been written about ad infinitum, even by reviewers during the time of the film's initial release in the mid-1980's.The first scene is a Protestant church in rural America where Rock of Ages (not the Def Leppard version) is a mainstay of the musical repertoire. Edna Spalding (Sally Field in an Academy-Award winning performance) is the wife and mother in a family of four in the rural south in Texas in the midst of the Depression. She is married to the unquestioned man-of-the-house, Royce Spalding, the sheriff of this small town. As the film progresses, we learn his role in the family was far more than simply the bread-winner. In addition to providing a good income, he took care of all bills, the finances, the mortgage on their house, even discipline.However, we don't learn about his role as head of the household by seeing him pay the mortgage and the bills, etc. At the very beginning of the story, Royce is killed at the hands of a young black man, Wylie, who was playing with a gun while drunk, a deadly combination. We get the sense Wylie had no intention of killing the white sheriff, but, as it was in those days, the accidental shooting signed the epitaph of Wylie as well. The two bodies are brought to their respective families and friends, with a brief appearance of the lynched Wylie being dragged behind a truck passed the house of the Spalding residence. This act will change the course of the Spalding family.After the social gathering mourning the deceased at the Spalding residence has ended, and the fried chicken and coffee cake have been consumed, Edna is dealt a curve ball care of the local bank via their powerless lackey, Mr. Denby (Lane Smith). After stating his willingness to help Edna in anyway, Mr. Denby tells her the bank would prefer if she sold their home and property in order to pay off the loan for the house. Inappropriately, he makes other suggestions about how to temporarily break up her family since they will be effectively homeless. (It is a snapshot into why life insurance became popular in the wake of the Depression.) She declines his suggestions and offers different ideas about how to create income for her family, but Denby rejects all of them, as if a woman was incapable of doing such things. His only concern is about the bank receiving its payment.However, Edna resolves to make a go of trying to create income for her family. She solicits the help of Moze (Danny Glover in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a middle-age black man who offered his help earlier in exchange for room and board. They decide to plant cotton in the nearly 40 acres of land owned by the Spaldings. Shortly thereafter, Mr Denby returns to the Spalding residence, and being the good Christian that he is, offers an arrangement which will make the bank happier about her keeping the property. He proposes to have his brother-in-law, Will (John Malkovich), a blind man injured in the Great War and currently unwanted by his family, to rent a room at the Spalding household as way to generate income. At first Edna declines the offer until she realizes she's not in a situation to refuse income, and so Will moves in, called Mr. Will by the kids and Moze.The five members, Edna, Moze, Mr. Will and the children become a new family from the ashes of the old. During the story, Edna learns to do all the things her husband used to do, such as creating income and signing checks, even disciplining the children with corporal punishment. At first, Mr. Will despises his circumstances, but gradually comes to care for and even love the children and Edna and even Moze. When a tornado descends upon the town, the family becomes unified in a way they hadn't expected. And towards the end, Mr. Will defends Moze, and this rings of some of the themes present in To Kill a Mockingbird, both the book and film.There is one side story which distracts from the main storyline Wayne, the husband of Edna's sister Margaret is having an affair with the local schoolteacher, Viola. Several scenes involve these other four characters interacting with one another. Unfortunately, these scenes were not as interesting as Edna et al, and it diminishes their storyline which is really the main focus of the film. As much as I like the talent of Ed Harris, Lindsay Crouse, and Amy Madigan I would have preferred their sequences cut with more screen time offered for the developing relationships between Edna, Moze, Mr. Will and the kids.Still, a fine film with incredible acting work. This may be the best acting of the three leads, plus honorable mention of the two young actors, Yankton Hatten and Gennie James as the kids Frank and Possum. Field certainly is as compelling as ever, but the other leads Glover and Malkovich not only keep up with her stride-for-stride, but make the story compelling from start to finish. And the two small roles of the sheriff and Wylie reappear at the very end, as if to remind us what led to the paths taken by the main characters.

For a number of years, Sally Field was at the forefront of such movies. Like her role in 1979's Norma Rae, Field's Spalding is a woman who's constantly belittled, conned and taken advantage of. Talent and tenacity eventually win the day, though, little miss Spalding proving all her doubters wrong.Places in the Heart features fine production design, Benton and his crew creating a nice portrait of life in 1930s Texas. Joining Spalding on her adventure are two other down-on-their-luck characters, a handicapped man played by John Malkovich and an African American drifter, Moze, played by Danny Glover. As is typical of Benton's films, the trio form a surrogate community, a band of beautiful losers who help each other out.Places in the Heart closes at a church ceremony, in which the dead and the living congregate. Charity never faileth, a Bible passage informs us, before the film pushes towards its bittersweet ending. Spalding may keep her farm, but her triumphs are tainted.Though a fine picture, Heart sports a dull subplot involving Edna's adulterous relatives. And though it overturns several Magical Negro clichés, Benton falters terribly in his last act. Here, via a contrived series of events, Moze is rushed out of Benton's picture, all so as Edna may stand on her own two feet.

The characters all have little failings, but nothing that can't be quickly overcome in the space of a tender, touching moment. Though many scenes walk right up to the line, they stop short of turning that well-earned tenderness into cloying sentimentality.The young, cherub-cheeked widow played by Sally Field is can-do-ism personified, and is perhaps more racially tolerant than the norm for 1930s Texas, especially considering that her husband has just been killed by a drunk, black youth. But the movie sells us on the idea that she has bigger problems to worry about than racial politics or even personal loss. The Depression is palpable throughout the movie, and it reshapes her life almost overnight. A neighbor is living in a car, paint on a nearby abandoned house says Gone to California, and now, with the death of the family breadwinner, Field's character also appears to be headed for bust. Worse, she may lose custody of her two children. With no time to mourn, she has to take in a surly boarder (John Malkovich, thoroughly believable as the blind WWI veteran) and hire a black man who previously stole from her (Danny Glover) in a desperate attempt to stay afloat. If it seems all too predictable that her headstrong determination and positive spirit will prevail, that her worldly-wise black field hand will prove his worth, and that the bottled-up boarder will grudgingly reveal his sensitive side, well... it wears it well. Perhaps these characters should be thought of in the way that many of us like to think of our grandparents and great-grandparents a little idealized in our minds, perhaps, but people who we believe were fundamentally good and who lived through difficult and transformative years in our history as soldiers, laborers, school children, and housewives. The final scene in the movie is a creative tracking shot that emphasizes the oneness of this diverse, often fragmented and antagonistic, yet familiar community that we have come to know. It is not just a Texas community, but an American one.It is hard to say what a slow-boiling side plot about marital infidelity, featuring a young and inscrutable Ed Harris, adds to the movie. There may be some thematic connection to a frightening sequence of a literally home-wrecking tornado. Or maybe it is a way to provide additional color by making the supporting characters flawed and allowing the main ones to remain only nominally imperfect. In any case, this B-plot is not very creatively rendered, and it takes time away from the Malkovich and Glover characters whose private lives would surely be far more interesting but are too seldom seen. This shortcoming, though, does not prevent the main plot from being as affirming and moving as it strives to be.

Basically set in Waxahachie, Texas in 1935, a place where white people and white people mostly separate themselves from each other, Sheriff Royce Spalding (Ray Baker) is investigating trouble at the railroad when he is accidentally shot dead by young black boy Wylie (De'voreaux White), white vigilantes punish him dragging behind a truck for all the community to see, including Spalding's family. The Sheriff's wife Edna Spalding (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Sally Field) is now alone to take care of her small children Frank (Yankton Hatten) and Possum (Gennie James) and maintain the farm, added pressure comes from her other family, her sister Margaret Lomax (Oscar nominated Lindsay Crouse) who cannot help because of her own family and her beauty shop, and her husband's brother-in-law Mr. Will (Oscar nominated John Malkovich) blinded in the war who becomes a lodger on the farm. The cotton crop is planted for the farm to make it's money, money is scarce and worse news is that the price of cotton is decreasing, she gives black drifter Moze (Danny Glover) work without payment, giving him meals instead, the handyman though is not satisfied and steals silverware to make some money, he is caught in the act but forgiven as he is the one who knows the cotton growing and marketing. Edna is determined to keep the family together and preserve the farm, and she sees the opportunity to win money they need to keep going, Ellis County prize has a prize of $100 that will go to the first bale of cotton brought to market, but she needs more cotton pickers who cannot be paid, she joins those that she finds to help her, bleeding herself in the thorns to finish the work, while Will cooks the food to reward the workers. Edna and Moze are the first to the wholesaler and do everything they can to convince the owner of how much the cotton bale is worth, it is unclear as to whether they win the prize or not, and returning to the farm Moze is confronted by Ku Klux Klan members, he is rescued by Will, but he decides reluctantly to move on, while Viola Kelsey (Amy Madigan) is departing with her husband Buddy (Terry O'Quinn) to Houston, after ending an affair with Edna's brother-in-law. In the end the film finishes where it all started, in church where the community are taking communion, Wayne Lomax (Ed Harris) passes to Margaret, and the bread and wine goes from to character to character, both those who are still living and dead, and the last words are spoken by Wylie to the Sheriff, obviously it is his actions that later lead to everything else. Also starring Lois & Clark's Lane Smith as Albert Denby and Bert Remsen as Tee Tot Hightower. Field is wonderful as the feisty and endearing small- town farmer and mother who goes through pain and graft to support her family, Malkovich is likable as the blind man who bonds with her, Glover gets his moments as the black man who is vulnerable but helps, and Harris gets a few small scenes doing his usual good job. Set in the Depression Era you know it is going to be full of despair and other small harsh realities of life, seeing the bleeding hands picking the cotton is most compelling, obviously there are the heartwarming scenes as well with the family orientation and community values, and it is paced well, it is a pleasant and enjoyable period drama. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Benton, and it was nominated for Best Picture and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

I recall an interview on public television in which Sally Field emphatically stressed to the audience of 50-60 college-aged, aspiring theatrical performers that their success in the business will depend more than anything else on their persistence. I get the feeling that Sally Field drew on her own experiences as a struggling yet determined actress to portray Norma Rae and Edna Spalding. The two women both embody Sally Field's courage and resolve in the face of repeated disappointments and frustrations.Like the members of the Academy in 1984, I also really enjoyed Places in The Heart. I saw impressive performances throughout, from the wife of the unfaithful husband, to the unsympathetic banker, to the abrupt blind man, to the devoted farm-hand. Only the part of Viola Kelsey, Edna Spalding's sister, and the scene with the tornado troubled me.Were Edna Spalding and her sister so estranged that Viola Kelsey could not have helped out a little by dealing with the heat and picking a few rows of cotton, or, if she did not want to get her hands dirty, at least have assured Edna Spalding that she had a place to stay if the bank had evicted her and her two children? In regards to the twister, wouldn't it have ripped a swath in the cotton field, possibly destroying chances of her earning enough money to save the farm? Seeing Edna Spalding, a widow raising two young children during the depression, overcome all that confronted her made me and many others feel hopeful. I did not want her not to succeed, even for the sake of a little more realism. "},{"Title":"One of my all-time top five, to say the least. An unforgettable movie.","Date":"21 October 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" A reviewer asked about the Bible verse quoted in the last scene It's I Corinthians 13 1  Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity (agape love), I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.I too was confused by the ending until I woke up and noticed that in the congregation taking the Lord's Supper are Sally Fields' dead husband sitting with his family and the young black boy who killed him, her sister & husband, the already-departed school teacher and her husband, the kind old lady killed in her car during the cyclone....If you really can't understand either the title or the last scene, I don't think it can be explained to you.I think my favorite scene is near the end, when Sally Fields is sitting at the kitchen table after supper cutting cardboard soles for her son's worn-out shoes and John Malkovich comes in and asks if he might make a cup of tea. While he's waiting for the kettle to boil he finally gets out the question you could see he'd been trying to work up courage to ask What do you look like? I can still see the play of expressions on both their faces and I can quote her sweet answer almost verbatim. You are fairly certain, after that scene, that the two of them will end up together--and what a nice thought. "},{"Title":"Recommendable for a Few Remarkable Scenes","Date":"10 April 2006","Score":"","Genre":"Drama","Review":" Places in the Heart is an enjoyable film that kept me entertained throughout the movie. The characters were convincing and believable, none of them were absolutely perfect. I mention this because many movies give us a 'hero' that has positively no flaws in the personality and everybody is supposed to love him. In this story we are lead to believe that Moze, an African-American cotton picker that helps the main character bring a steady income into her household, is our 'hero.' Yet at the beginning he tries to steal silverware.The story gives us a traditional formula that has been passed down through many generations. We are introduced to the Spaldings, a simple family going through the Great Depression. The father, Royce, is the respected town sheriff. His wife, Edna (Sally Field), is an independent woman who wants to do the best for her children, Possum and Frank. On a standard call for a drunken child, Royce is accidentally shot and passes away, leaving Edna all alone without financial support to help her family.The town seems to show Edna a great amount of compassion, but that image is a lie. Her banker suggests that she sell her house, which is all she has. People pretend to comfort her, yet go off to party seconds after. Normally this would work but I couldn't tell if this was the filmmakers' intent. When Edna is down at her worst, an African-American stranger named Moze (Danny Glover) asks her for work. She is hesitant and awkward. She offers him breakfast but that's it. During the breakfast Moze suggests to Edna that her land would be perfect for planting cotton, and that he could show her how. She gives him a stern no, but the audience can sense that she is definitely thinking about it.She gives the idea to her banker, who is extremely reluctant. He gives her bills showing the dropping progress of other cotton-pickers. She decides that she is desperate enough to trust Moze and they start planting the cotton. Meanwhile there is constant social problems going on with her kids, but like the many other subplots in this film, we are simply not interested in this trouble. Edna also takes in a blind man named Mr. Will (John Malkovich) to help pay the bills. Together they become a family; a strange, diverse family.So this all sounds like a good plot, and I was interested in this plot. Unfortunately that is not the only story we have to worry about. This film shares half its time with a plot between Edna's sister, Margaret Lomax (Lindsey Crouse), and her cheating husband Wayne Lomax (Ed Harris). The movie jumps in between these two stories, each giving them one scene after another. The problem is that we don't need this other plot. In fact, we're just not interested in it. The other plot could be a whole movie for all I cared. This extra plot gives the movie a running time of almost 2 hours. The main plot between Edna and her farm often seems rushed and quickly played out, which could be avoided if this other plot were ceased to be. There is two scenes were the plantation is on the verge of destruction, yet the next scene it is doing just fine, without any explanation of how the characters were able to fix the fields.As I mentioned in my review title, this movie has some remarkable scenes, which give us a good movie. At the risk of giving too much of a spoiler, I will tell you that I have 3 favorite scenes in this movie, and one of those scenes is the last scene in the movie, which has gotten mixed reviews from other people. Either they say that it was very well-done and emotional, or that it was confusing and random. I loved the last scene because the camera-work and idea brought us into another world. A world that we wish we lived in now. A world not obstructed by racism. Where forgiveness is a common trait shared by all. It reminds us that we can all achieve this world, if we simply stopped hating others.Besides the second plot, my biggest problem with this movie was that nothing was resolved. Again, I do not want to give anything away, but the spectacular ending scene came too early. The second plot was more resolved than the first, which ultimately gave me a sense of disappointment. Everything was perfect; well-built characters, audience-hooking plot, beautiful film-work, great acting, but no resolution.However, even with all its downfalls, the viewer will most likely put this movie down as a classic, if not one that they certainly remembered. I recommend you rent this one if possible.-Z.

The film itself is fairly well made, if perhaps not deserving of all the attention that it received at the time. Racism and difficult living issues are explored well, but it is all a little too grim, the characters are not easy to like, and it is predictable to a degree. However, none of these problems are the major downfall of the film. The main problem I had with it was the way it juggled two story lines. The Ed Harris and Lindsay Crouse subplot is nothing out of the ordinary, and it adds nothing to the film, except to act as a distraction to the central drama involving Sally Field. It is not a bad film though, and it has by all means an interesting ending. It is worth a look.

I disagree. While the cast is incredible, and even includes a young Terry O'Quinn, the film as a whole just did not impress me.Robert Benton is a fine director, although maybe not a well-known one. He excelled with Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and made a decent thriller with Twilight (1998). But this particular film was not one that I felt was that great. Maybe I just was not moved by Depression-era cotton farming and race relations in Texas...

My father in law has always maintained you don't need to watch a movie more than once. I say bunkum to that. As a projectionist for one of our Universities in Sydney, Australia, back in the mid to late seventies - I always learned something or saw something I had not noticed before as I ran many movies over and over. Each time seeing something I missed before. Places in The Heart is one such movie. So many of the reviewers have widely covered the many aspects of Places. Each review I have read (and as at 26th October, 2012, I have read them all) - in a lot of cases bring up another aspect not covered before by others. I just wanted to maybe round them all up and add a comment on my part as well. I agree with one reviewer that kind of alluded to how close Sally Field's role in Places reflected her LIVE struggle for recognition on the screen. I also agree with some reviewers note of the out right hypocrisy being portrayed by all these nice people in the daytime to be members of the hateful, violent Klan at night.I loved the young man who portrayed Frank and what a good son being willing to take his licking as he would have done when his dad was to punish him. I would like to look for more roles the young actor plays. The one who played Possum was good also. Regarding the insertion of the extra-marital goings on..i wonder if this was done to reach a bigger audience with a more Mature kind of Rating..PG here in Australia. But as another reviewer stated 'it might have given the audience more time to finish their pop corn and soda.' Hmm. I am glad someone brought up the answer another looked for about the passage of Scripture towards the end. I will add it at the end of this Review. I must say I thought, as a musician that likes bright, rousing hymn singing - the hymns were more like a dirge...harmonious but SO slllllow it's a wonder people didn't go to sleep. These days I am familiar with most American rendition of hymns being the opposite in always done very fast and breath-takingly. I enjoyed all the actors in the movie Sally Field, Danny Glover, John Malkovich being one of his earlier movies on reflection as I have seen him much later in Man In The Iron Mask and most recently in Empire of the Sun I thoroughly recommend the movie to everyone. The passage of Scripture to be preached in the last scene -one of the reviewers was asking about follows. It is from the King James Version of the Bible.1 Corinthians 131 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.1 Corinthians 132 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.1 Corinthians 133 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.1 Corinthians 134 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,1 Corinthians 135 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;1 Corinthians 136 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;1 Corinthians 137 Beareth all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.1 Corinthians 138 Charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. What an appropriate scripture for this type of movie and all it portrays.
