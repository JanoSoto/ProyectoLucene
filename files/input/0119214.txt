That doesn't mean it's an award winner it's pretty stupid, but it is refreshing to see a movie in which both Joe Pesci and Danny Glover star and never utter a profane word! Unbelievable! And you can add Rosanna Arquett to that list, too, and she wasn't exactly Mother Teresa in a lot of films.The professional critics totally lambasted this film, which wasn't altogether fair, either. It is refreshing in its innocence (something critics know nothing about) and it has its funny moments. Best of all it's entertaining. Yes, this is Lightweight with a capital L but I've seen a whole lot of films that were the opposite and total garbage. At least you watch this with your kids and have some laughs.

These two fellas intend to go for a fishing, but things don't go according to plan, delivering a lot of bad situations-- which aren't that bad, since both characters are optimist. What amazes me the most is how the humor scenes are filled with original jokes, like the scene in which they are in the first restaurant making their orders like a homosexual couple, and not paying attention that everybody around them felt that way. It's funny how filmmakers portray them like two very innocent guys that end up succeeding in getting the prize-- in fact, the smaller prize-, making you feel like there's no need to be a smart pants to be rewarded. I read some criticism towards the acting, but in my point of view, the whole cast is professional, and the main actors are even a little above average. Besides, the plot is fast paced, never tiring the spectator. Also, it's a BIG personal coincidence that they mention 1972's Deliverance, given that I was just about to watch that movie, but preferred catching what was on cable. All in all, Gone Fishin' is surely a feel good movie that have been hidden from mainstream since it was released, but it's hard for you to not enjoy it!

They share a love for fishing and receive coupons to stay at the Florida Everglades. What follows is a series of misadventures. One of the film's running jokes is the childish nature of the leads. We learn that Joe fears lightning while Gus has a sleepwalking disorder. They stop at a diner where their fishing talk catches the attention of the film's villain who steals their car. They are soon accompanied by two women who seek out the thief due to stolen money. Title suggests adventure but the whole love for fishing and such may cue in to certain viewers who may share the passion. Director Christopher Cain proves to understand the style of comedy particularly during a hilarious train track sequence. Joe Pesci and Danny Glover have great comedic chemistry although seeing Pesci bring down a plane with a fishing line is a bit too far fetched. Willie Nelson is embarrassing as a guardian angel who should never have factored in. Rosanna Arquette and Lynn Whitfield play the two females out for justice. Those roles had potential but never really elevate off the screen. Simple yet well made comedy about friendship within a screenplay that remembers those carefree days by the lake.

They enjoy fishing. One day they win a fishing contest with their idol, Billy Catch Pooler. The prize was a fishing vacation in Glory Glades, Florida. So they pack up Joe's '68 blue Baracuda and their fishing boat. They've got everything beer, gear, drammermine. They're off!      Now when people go on vacation, a fishing vacation at that, they expect everything will go perfectly, but if you're Joe and Gus, then everything MUST go wrong. Lady Luck takes her vacation when Joe and Gus pull into a road stop diner for breakfast. They meet a notorious killer, Dekker Macey. They don't know who he is. He snatches Joe's keys and steal his car, but leaves the boat. So Joe and Gus push the boat down the highway and run into two women who are after the guy who stole the car, so they hitch a ride with them. Guy suggests they use thekiller looks. Joe doesn't have that great of a memory so Gus reminds him. They had tied their boat to the girls' car and they tied the knot wrong, so the rope came loose, just as Gus and Joe leapt into the boat to save the beer. Now the girls are going one way, and the boat is cruising the other way.        They try the anchor, which latches onto a train and tows the boat away with it, leaving Joe and Gus. They soon come across Joe's stolen car at a gas station. They snatch it back and Joe is so overwhelmed that he got his car back.        That night, they go to Glory Glades and stay in a camper, due to Hurricane Andrew blew away the lodge. That night they learn of Dekker and the big reward for his capture. Next day they got Phil Beasely's to buy a new boat like their old one, but get sweet talkedinto buying the Ranger 250C. How much is it? Well let's just say that you'd have to make 810 easy payments of $39.95. So Joe and Gus are allowed to take it for a test drive. Chaos ensues when the boat goes out of control (this sadly killed a stunt woman) and by the time the boat stops, it's a complete wreck, so are all the other boats around them.        On the drive home, the tire blows out and when getting the spare out, they find a treasure map that leads to $2 1/2 million. They figure this calls for a celebration, so they go to a richhotel and rent out the presidential suite. They even dine with fine wine and a waitor named Kirk. They meet the girls there also. Gus ate steak for dinner and whenever he does, he sleepwalks. So he unconsciously wreaked havoc on the hotel and when Joe chased himoutside, the hotel blew up. The map was also gone. But they still go for the money when Joe get's his memory back by getting struck by lightning. Dekker is hot on their trail. Joe and Gus go through a treacherous swamp and into a cave, where they run into a fierce alligator. They get the money, but Dekker shows up, gun in hand.He ties up Joe and Gus, and leaves, taking the money. But then they're rescued, by Billy Catch Pooler himself! He gives them some very useful advice then leaves. Gus and Joe commendere an air boat and chase after Dekker. Joe hooks him with his fishing pole. The police and media arrive and Dekker goes to jail. Joe and Gus are heroes! They get the reward, but then are confronted by the things they wrecked that they must pay for.         This movie, to be honest, doesn't really appeal to me. It has it's funny moments and everything, but you just get to feel so sorry for these guys, especially when mean old Dekker makes them push Joe's car into the swamp. That's just awful. This movie was good for Joe Pesci, because Pesci means Fish in Italian, and his character's first name is Joe. Also this is a new character for Joe Pesci, because in his other films, he plays an evil gangster or a ruthless con artist. In this one he plays a good guy. Danny Glover was good also. Pesci and Glover were together in Lethal Weapons II, III, and IV. Except they're nicer to eachother in this movie. If you're fans of those men, you oughta see the movie.

As the saying goes, If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all. That seems to be the premise of this movie that tries to mine laughs from their misadventures.Unfortunately no matter how hard Pesci and Glover try they can't overcome what is simply a bad script that calls for them to be unbelieveably stupid.

In Pesci's case we've seen him in parts that make him come across as silly, but Glover is out of his element here -- you just can't imagine that he is THAT stupid.Sorry guys. The funniest part of this movie was within the first 2 minutes, when we see the childhood friends in the situation that started their whole reputation of being bad news.Kids 10 and under may find a few things they think are funny, though that may be a stretch. Parents, don't worry about letting your kids see this. Language is virtually non-existent and there is no sex though the guys try to charm a couple of girls -- or at least think they are. Violence is of the painless type -- wrecked cars, boats, buildings, and so on -- but no actual on screen problems. My suggestion? Avoid the film unless you want something to put the kids to sleep.

They can play great dramatic and comic roles. But with Gone Fishin' their first attempt at comedy together someone ought to encourage both Pesci and Glover not to make any other comedy movies together. It's obvious that the biggest problem with Gone Fishin' is its script. Pesci and Glover are not to blame they are trying to act good. Its the writers and director's fault. Some of the lines in this film are extremely annoying e.g. This trip ain't even a one its a frigging zero, or when Pesci tells the film's villain that he is a freak about 10 times and tells him why don't you join the army if your'e a tough guy you freak. The other problem is that with the exception of the first two Home Alone pictures you cannot give Joe Pesci a script that is PG rated and expect him to act funny with it. Joe Pesci needs stronger material. I am not saying they needed to make the film R rated with the f-word every other word, or extreme violence but why couldn't they make this like Grumpy Old Men and make it on a PG-13 rated level? If they would have done that this movie would have been ten times funnier. And why didn't they actually have Pesci and Glover actually go fishing in the movie instead of a million disasters preventing them from going fishing? They do not fish in the entire 94 minutes of the movie except for the finale. Danny Glover has made a few other movies since this one but I have only seen Joe Pesci do two other movies since this one. I am wondering if its because he was embarrassed by how he acted in this movie. Gone Fishin' certainly is not awful but its such a shame to see two exceptionally talented actors act with such an annoying awful script. Its the kind of movie you might want to watch if the weather is really bad outside and you have nothing better to do. But if you are a big fan of either Pesci or Glover you might want to avoid this one because they are trying to act good with a bad script and in the end they have made a pretty big mistake by making Gone Fishin' "},{"Title":"Great comedy","Date":"27 July 2005","Score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" I laughed all through this movie twice.

There have been better comedies before and since this movie.  True, hearing the characters calling each other by their first names every so often can be annoying at times, I am PLEASED that I didn't hear much profanity in the movie.I would much rather hear the characters' first names in every other sentence than profanity.  So, this movie is rare in the sense of NOT having profane jokes and potty humor (like Austin Powers) to encourage laughter.  But, knowing how today's society is, there is still the occasional hell, damn, and such.Second, when I was watching this movie, I began to think of how the characters relied on some physical comedy and some crude slapstick humor. I do think the comedic routine could've been more refined and I have laughed at The Three Stooges, Oliver and Hardy, Abott and Costello, and the older classic comedies more than I did in this movie.  Dumb and Dumber was funnier, but somewhat vulgar.Third, the plot and the characters could've been more refined, too.  It seems as though about all the characters had to do was to act silly and get overly excited about winning a fishing trip and being very naive and innocent while creating havoc.  But, this movie is simple and doesn't rely on some of the other crap that other movies rely on to get a laugh.Finally, I would suggest this movie to older viewers who do appreciate a simple comedy without all of the unnecessary violence, potty humor, and profanity as evident in most of today's movies.  (If this movie could've been more refined, I would've given it an 8 out of 10, but instead I give it a 5.)PS--I don't think that most of mainstream society would appreciate this movie as they might appreciate potty humor and profanity, which I think is worse to think about than this movie itself!Happy Viewing!

I believe it was Truman Capote, once said that when he was bored at dinner parties the only thing he could do, to keep sane since there was no escape, was to analyze the other person to find out why he found them so boring. This is a movie which could generate a lot of analysis. The core of the problem is the characterizations of Pesci and Glover. They play, straight faced, a pair of extremely stupid friends to which infantile catastrophes happen. These are largely physical inasmuch as neither is bright enough for repartee. Historically the center of any physical comedy routine is an essential childlike innocence. Reference the films of Jerry Lewis or Jim Carrey. When Pesci and Glover, as tired middle aged men, try the same routines they simply look pathetic. Pesci has pulled off this role, albeit playing a character who thought he was smarter than he was, in Home Alone. However there he benefited from a much better script in terms of dialog and physical setups. However, in Gone Fishin',  there is simply no good dialog and no surprises in the action. Only Gary Grubbs, as a shifty boat dealer, seems to generate any fun. The true pity of this film was that one of the stunt women, Janet Wilder, was killed in a boating accident while the film was being made. To die young for Gone With The Wind would be a tragedy lessened by one's achievements. To die young for this worthless waste of film is just doubly tragic.

Make it a quirky, not very serious, fun kids movie. It seems they picked the two most serious actors for the job though. Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are good in lots of things they have been in, but this is just neither of them at their best. I think the problem was the PG rating. This could have been a great film if it had an R rating. Its almost like Glover and Pesci are struggling to hold back the words they want to use. You can tell Pesci just wants to blow off steam at points in the film. If this was R, it could have been a quirky, funny, and all out Comedy.Glover and Pesci play Gus and Joe, two average guys who want to get away and have a simple, relaxing vacation at the Everglades. They get way more than they ask for after having their car stolen at a restaurant. They realize the man who stole their car is a crook and a killer so Gus and Joe pair up with two girls looking for the man, for a little while, then go off on their own getting into their own trouble. They embark in every which way to try and stop the crook, but they just dig themselves deeper in a hole. Their stupidity doesn't help the situation one bit has both the leads are clueless and naive. But they are dependent on catching the guy and still making it home for Thanksgiving with their family.Once again, sometimes their stupidity tends to drag the film on which I've never been a fan of. Its just like in Dinner for Schmucks and Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd. Stupidity is one thing, overwhelmingly stupid is another. It wears on you and almost makes you believe the actors are as dumb as they appear. But, thankfully, Gone Fishin' knows its limits and doesn't make the characters brainy, smartasses or make them bumbling nitwits. So the film doesn't fail there.While being completely harmless, at the same time, its overly kiddish. We saw Joe Pesci play stupid in Home Alone, but now, after seeing Casino and Goodfellas, I don't want to see him in a PG rated kid movie. Id rather have him be in an R rated Comedy where he can be himself and the same goes with Danny Glover. If this was R, it would probably earn another star, and quite possibly, another star in a half. But at least we get a relaxing opening driving scene with a great Willie Nelson tune in the background and a delightful appearance by him as well.Gone Fishin' was panned at the time, but it should also be taken into mind Janet Wilder was killed during a scene in this movie, so that doesn't give the movie a get-out-of-harsh-words free card, but it should just be said and maybe go easy on the movie. While Im not praising Gone Fishin', Im neither recommending it very far. Keep that in mind.Starring Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Nick Brimble, Rosanna Arquette, Lynn Whitfield, and Willie Nelson.

This years their wives are made it quite clear to them that they must get back before Thanksgiving or they will kill them! Despite assurances that all will be well, Gus and Joe barely get a day's drive away from home before they get their car stolen by a man they don't realise is a wanted killer, get picked up by a couple of gorgeous women (well, one gorgeous woman and Rosanna Arquette) and lose their boat on the back of a train. Getting their car back by chance they wind up in the possession of a murder weapon and, while trying to continue their fishing trip, the killer starts to track them down.Although this film isn't as terrible as many people claim it is, it certainly is not any good and won't please the vast majority of viewers &#150; even those looking for basic laughs. It is a worry that the film switched directors early in the shooting but it is even more offputting to think that someone actually died to produce this film. I know that wasn't in their contract but do you think that this comedy was the legacy that the stuntwoman who died wanted forever associated with her name? Regardless of this sad event though, the film is still a real dog, with a plot that doesn't hang together and just turns into a series of horribly contrived scenes that are nonsense &#150; whether it be stolen cars, bloody knives and treasure maps. Cain directs with a heavy touch, unable to do anything other than resort to lots of things falling down and crashing.This leaves the film relying very heavily on cast to carry it with their charisma and chemistry. On this level Pesci and Glover seem like having a reasonable shot at pulling it off but without any material they can't do it. They bumble and bicker reasonably well but they are so far from being real people that it is hard to see them as anything other than just noise. Neither men do their careers any favours &#150; Pesci is annoying while Glover is just slumming. Arquette and Whitfield are wasted with nothing to do while Brimble is a non-entity as a threat.Overall then a very unfunny comedy that will maybe distract children but nobody else (in fact when I taped it, it was on in the morning during school holidays). The material is weak from start to finish and the cast cannot do anything to lift it. I didn't laugh once and while it wasn't the worst film around, it is a pretty pointless way to time and money.

Anyway, the two get into all sorts of trouble and, if you are still watching by the end, you will be terribly disappointed by the ending. Then again, you may be cheering when the end arrives as you will be one of the few to sit through this movie. 2 stars out of 5.

There's no good word to say about it. Danny Glover is a second hand actor anyways, but Joe Pesci is a bit of a legend. Both guys are above 40 by now, but act like little children, in which they really fail. An attempt tobe like 'dumb and dumber', but fails in every way. Any user comments that write 'fantastic movie, rent it, but it', etc are just to fool you! This movie really stinks.

You used to be a great actor whom I respected a lot, but now... I don't know what to think. This movie is bad. I'm not sure it was supposed to be funny. The, so-called, jokes were so lame my face turned redder than red. Joe Pesci, does the only character he's ever done. But worse than usual. He was good in the Lethal Weapon movies, and Home Alone, and GoodFellas, and Casino, and that 8 Heads In A... whatever they were in. But not even Joe Pesci can save this movie from being the most worthless piece of crap I've seen in a looooooong time.

A movie is awful when situations are not credible. When something is not credible, then it cannot be funny or scary or whatever! This movie is loaded with situations that are not believable, making it extremely UNFUNNY. Joe Pesci's phony southern/ red-neck/yokel accent was pathetic in it's believability. Glover was okay, but he had a horrible script to work with. The contrived situations are so far-fetched as to make the view say... Give me a break! The stunts are pathetic in the extreme. Stunts that are not possible are not enjoyable. Remember, Hollywood, it's gotta be believable to be enjoyed. Life is short, Hollywood Quit wasting our time with junk.

I Don't Think So Gus.","Date":"25 September 1999","Score":"5 out of 12 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":"  This has got to be the worst comedy I have seen in a few years. Pesci and Glover must have been really desperate to take these roles. Their characters are mentally retarded people from New Jersey who win a fishing trip to the Florida everglades. Could've been a funny movie but everything from start to finish is predictable and NOT FUNNY! It gets even worse after you keep hearing the guys call each other by their first names in every other sentence. Here's an example of the dialogue throughout the entire movie(Hey Gus, what should we do? I don't know Joe. Gus, this is weird. They stole my car. We can go find it Joe. Will you help me find it Gus? Sure I'll help you find it Joe. Thanks Gus. No Problem Joe, Always glad to help Joe. Thanks Gus. You know what Gus? You're a real pal! So are you Joe! A real pal.) Gus Gus Joe Joe Joe Gus Gus Joe Gus Joe Joe Gus.....on and on and on and on and on. Did the writer not pick up on this when he was writing the script? Maybe he did but he forgot to think about one thing....IT'S NOT FUNNY!!! * out of ****. Waste of talent. Pesci should get back in his mobster roles since he hasn't done a decent movie in 4 years. And Glover better start working on a Lethal Weapon 5. Get to work Boys!

I felt sorry for Joe P. and Danny G.  The only humour in the portion I saw was the two main characters acting like imbeciles - without any wit or whim in the screenplay.  Don't show this to company unless you don't like them.

TV sitcoms are more clever.","Date":"30 November 2005","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Crime","Review":" Have you noticed that all the reviews defend this movie as being not that bad? There is nothing redeeming about this film. I watched it on HBO on Demand because I thought Glover and Pesci would be a good combo, but man was it disappointing. I found myself trying to make myself laugh at certain points. The movie has a decent plot, but its predictable and the main characters act stupid for no apparent reason. The script was just poorly written. If a movie character says something then smiles or laughs, it doesn't automatically become funny.If you read a review that says, this movie really wasn't that bad, then you can bet it was horrible... Its easy to find a scene or two that is enjoyable, but the only way to enjoy this movie is to get really, really, really drunk. Its the only way to get in the same mindset as the people who produced, wrote, and acted in this movie.

I like stupid comedy but this was horrible comedy, the only funny part of the movie for me was when the reporter was holding the WINK microphone at the end to the 2 guys saying how they captured the criminal, cuz WINK is one of our TV stations. if your one who likes stupid comedy, try some adam sandler movies, or chris farley movies, Joe and Danny do not make good stupid comedy.

My daughter loved it, if that tells you anything. Only a child could like this senseless tripe. I just have one question--what in God's name did Danny and Joe need money that badly for?  There's no way they could've read the script and said, Hey, I've gotta do this movie! I was embarrassed for them. I am amazed that anyone over the age of 12 could find it remotely amusing.  "}]
