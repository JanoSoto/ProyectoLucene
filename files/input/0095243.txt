Enviromental enthusiast?  Insane eco-warrior?  Or both?Gorillas In The Mist is the story of this extraordinary woman whose work with Mountain Gorillas in Congo, and subsequently Rwanda, quite possibly saved these beautiful creatures from extinction.  Her hard work and determination in studying these wonderful animals led to an amazing living arrangement with them.How simply amazing must it be to touch, play and hold hands with a silverback Gorilla in the wilds of Africa?  How would it feel to find that same silverback with his head, hands and feet cut off by poachers? To be frank, these gorillas were Dian Fossey's children - each had a name, each had their own unique trait - so it is hardly surprising that she became a little possessive and started treating the animals as her own.  The horrors that she experienced on those mountains would send anyone mad.Sigourney Weaver is simply superb as Fossey, portraying her hard work and gradual decline into insanity with that touch that only a few actresses possess.  Her chemistry with co-star Bryan Brown adds to the feel of the film and the fact that she was brave enough to go anywhere near real gorillas is fascinating.  To be fair, the two hours do drag a little, but Weaver is talented enough to carry the film through it.Weaver once said I only get the parts that Meryl Streep passes up but to be honest, I couldn't imagine this brilliant woman being played by anyone else but Sigourney.

Originally Dian herself was helping to make the film, until she was murdered and the production team had to go back and start it all over again several years later in 1988. I am aware she did complete a degree when she returned to the USA in 1980 and wrote her book, which was published in 1983, and then revised in 1985. She returned to Africa in to help the gorillas and was murdered in 1984/1985 I believe near Christmas. She may have done things that weren't ethical according to some, though her plight to save the gorilla came first. This movie does give a fairly accurate but slightly toned down version of the events, which took place, though there were a few changes in details. It would be impossible to fit 13 years of events into just over one and a half hours of footage. So I think Hollywood did a good job.The main alterations, leaving out some of the details of horrific animal abuse that would have otherwise pushed the rating up to an R16 and probably left any animal lover in tears. The details they left out as well may have made the film a little to shocking for the chief censors.The special effects makeup, I believe done by Rick Baker, and real gorilla footage is seamless, making it hard to tell which parts were real gorillas and which are very well created costumes.After purchasing the DVD I now realize they had Dian Fossey's original tracker with them to help with the film.All up I think this film gives us just enough drama, action and thrills to make it a hit. I think Sigorney Weaver should have won an academy award for this especially considering how brave she was to film on location with real gorilla right next to her.This movie has inspired myself to change my career path and am also reading the book, which I would recommend for anyone who wants to see how much more horrific the events were in reality.This movie is a must see, who knows it may even change your life.

Fossey's life - and ultimately her tragic and violent death - leaps out from the screen through Weaver, as we watch her evolve from the uncertain and inexperienced assistant to the great anthropologist Louis Leakey to the committed expert on these marvelous creatures, sometimes going over the top in her quest to save them. Be warned of some possible spoilers ahead.The movie is absolutely heart-breaking in places. The terrified mother gorilla trying to save her baby as the tree they've climbed is cut down by poachers; Fossey's anguished cries of I'm sorry, I'm sorry, to the baby she nursed back to health only to have to turn her over to zookeepers; the horrible death of Digit. I have to confess that each of these scenes brought a few tears to my eyes. And yet the basic gentleness and nobility of the gorilla is brought out as well, and the movie ends on a sad yet hopeful note. Fossey is murdered - certainly by the poachers she opposed for years - but her body is buried beside her beloved Digit, and the gorillas (even Digit's group) live on and increase in number.The movie contains strong supporting performances from Bryan Brown as National Geographic photographer Bob Campbell, with whom Fossey falls in love but for whom she won't leave her gorillas, from John Omirah Miluwi as Sembagare, Fossey's gentle guide through the African jungles to Iain Cuthbertson who was perfectly believable as Louis Leakey.This is spectacular.

There isn't a great deal or depth or moralising here. Instead, what you see is what you get - an interesting, evocative and sometimes compelling story of mankind's relationship with nature.The film has strengths and weaknesses evenly distributed. Of course, the gorillas are the real stars of the show here (no disrespect to Sigourney Weaver, turning in another Ripley-esque tough-as-nails performance) and whenever they're on screen, the film comes to life. The film isn't afraid to tug at the heartstrings when poachers come into the plot, but that's fine by me.Where the film doesn't work is in its attempts at Hollywood convention. The real life of Dian Fossey - including her mysterious death - just doesn't tie up neatly into a package. Hence we get the shoehorned-in romantic subplot involving an extraneous Bryan Brown. Nonetheless, GORILLAS IN THE MIST is worth seeing and far more enlightening than most nature documentaries you see on TV any night of the week.

It also tries to glorify someone who i just can't respect all that much. I am not an environmentalist, and i do certainly believe that anyone who thinks an animal life is superior to any human life is rather insane. While Fossey seems to have simply ignored the fact that in her struggles to save the gorillas she was also denying money to impoverished African families, it is an interesting topic to bring up. Her valiant effort, however, has saved the gorillas; to that end, i think her life's work is pretty important.The teaser on the box to the film says something like, You may respect what she did. Or you may condemn it. But you will never forget the passion that turned her into a legend. These sentences undoubtedly sum up the film perfectly. Dian did some great things, but she also did some horrible things. The scene in which she scares the little boy by pretending to be a witch is absolutely horrifying. I'm sorry, but finding a baby gorilla wasn't worth doing what she did. Even further, when she faux-hangs the poachers, you get an insight into Dian's passion. I believe she probably suffered from some form of psychosis; her passion was extreme and powerful for the gorillas, which is wonderful, but the lengths she went to to protect them is simply inexcusable.The film was well-written, but I can't help but wish that more insight be given into Dian's life. Practically the whole movie takes place in Africa. I want to know what led her away to these gorillas. What was her life like? Why did she leave her fiance to be with the animals? Her life seems like a tragedy to me, but undoubtedly not to her. She never got to have what we consider a normal life, with a husband and children, but i think that this is part of the movie. Fossey was a different and unique person who didn't need all that.Fossey was very morally ambiguous. She was not a heroine, nor a villain. I do condemn some of the things she did, but also commend her valiant effort. But most of all, the reason to see this movie is to see the undeniable passion that made Fossey a legend.

The latter part of the film, when Dian dare to sacrifice anything to protect her gorillas, debatably it has an utmost joy to find something worth dying for, which most of us is still looking for and possibly we will never get it.At large the film is demystified to watch, apart from a few unavoidably horrendous scenes of massacring the primates.

While many of her antics could be seen as some what psychotic in nature, one has to realize what she was up against. The poachers in Africa, the ones she was fighting against, are not exactly known as being law abiding or overly moral people. I think what she did took an amazing amount of guts and applaud her for it. One also has to realize that the movie was made, not just to get this story out, but also for entertainment. Many things were dramatized to add a bit of excitement. Anyone who is really interested, should read her book by the same title, as this movie was based off of that. And anyone who believes she got what she deserved, obviously deserves to suffer the same fate.

She was nothing like the character given to us by Sigourney Weaver.  In terms of what is presented in the film, based largely on her book by the same title, she was a loner, a sociopath and a thoroughly unpleasant person with no tolerance for the opinions or views of others that did not square with hers.  No, she did not deserve to be brutally murdered as she was in 1986.  But, she did relate to the gorillas and related passionately.  This much in the film was true.  I won't go into all the sordid details because it serves no purpose.  Reading the reviews here, most viewers came away with an appreciation for the destruction of the mountain gorilla, their habitat and their species.  Dian Fossey for all her faults ranted and raved against the injustice of it all and tried in her maniacal way to do something about it.  We can criticize her for her complete lack of people skills but her work as a careful observer of gorilla behavior and as a skillful photographer will endure long after we have forgotten what a pain she was personally.  By the way, the late Louis S.B. Leakey, like Dian Fossey, never completed a doctorate.  Not that they needed it.  Leakey was a great showman, fantastic fund raiser and both were passionate about Africa.  Leakey, his wife, son and now, ex-daughter-in-law, have contributed greatly to our understanding of fossil hominids.  Leakey was arguing humans evolved in Africa long before it was fashionable.  Not only that, Leakey was the one who got a shy,soft-spoken English girl to go out and observe chimpanzees. Jane Goodall has contributed greatly to our understanding of the role these close relatives of out play in helping us understand human evolution.  Dian Fossey's work, while not great in terms of its theoretical contributions, has nevertheless made most of us aware of the issues facing the preservation of the mountain gorilla. The movie?  Well, there are some facts in it...even if they're highly romanticized and a bit distorted.

Instead, we get a mediocre film that has questionable ethics. My first impression, when Fossey arrived in Africa, was Who is she? What motivates and compels her? Why is she interested in the mountain gorilla? How did she hear about the conference she met Leakey at?The film needed to include some footage and treatment of her teaching her human students and explaining how this relates to her decision to abandon that type of job for one on anthraopological study. This is never approached in the film, and I spent the entire film wondering who Dian Fossey was.It was the gruesome content that repelled me, though I did not need to see the scene where the gorilla tribe was killed and butchered. The people who are most likely to watch this film are those who care about animals, and they are not going to be entertained by seeing the aforementioned animals slaughtered. What I found most appalling, though, even worse than the scene where the gorilla tribe is killed, is when Fossey surrenders the baby gorilla to the poachers. At this point, I lost all respect for her, and most particularly, for screenwriter Anna Phelan and director Michael Apted.Immediately after they nail the boards of the box cage the baby gorilla is in, they are seen by a river, joking, smiling, sexually cavorting and smoking cigarettes.While I do appreciate Fossey's work with the gorillas and her attacks on the tribe of thugs that poached them (for centuries), the heart of this movie is in question It was a brutal and insensitive portrayal of a rare communication between man and animal that could have been delightful and inspiring. Hollywood just couldn't resist the opportunity for more violence and single-dimensioned characters, though.

Based on the true story, Dian Fossey (Golden Globe winning, and scar nominated Sigourney Weaver) is the woman from Kentucky fascinated with studying animals, especially with primates, she is particularly inspired by the work of anthropologist Dr. Louis Leakey (Iain Cuthbertson). With the permission of Leakey she travels to deepest Africa to start her work studying these fascinating creatures, living in a Rwandan village with the loyal people who live close to where the primates settle. Soon enough in the jungle Dian and her helpers come across a group of rare mountain gorillas, and she begins to study them in very close proximity, and they do not seem to be bothered or feel threatened, she learns to find communication. But her passion for the safety and protection of the primates seems to preoccupy her, she becomes easily angered by poachers and others who disturb, and she misses out on a romance with National Geographic photographer Bob Campbell (Bryan Brown). Dian complains to the Rwandan government that the poaching is going on because it is the only way for the country to survive, and after they refuse to help she dedicates her time to making poaching illegal and ending possible extinction. Besides starting anti-poaching groups and charities, she also burns down found poachers huts, and does a mock hanging on one of them as a brutal warning, but her good work did do good for her beloved gorillas. In the end though she was mysteriously murdered with a blow to the head by some tool that was identified as belonging to the poachers, the mystery apparently remains unsolved.

They have also been endangered for years, suffering from the threats of poachers, deforestation and civil war. Gorillas in the Mist tells the story of Dian Fossey who made it her lives work to protect gorillas in Rwanda.Dian Fossey (Sigourney Weaver) was an Occupational Theparist from America when after attending a talk volunteers to study gorillas in Africa. She works for National Geographic and she attempts to study the apes and count their numbers. In Rwanda she ends up becoming very close to one group of gorillas and her research becomes very important to the scientific community. She becomes a celebrity in the wider world and brings publicity to the plight of the apes. She ends up becoming very close an Australian photographer Bob Campbell (Bryan Brown), who films and photographers the gorillas. Dian sets out to protect the gorillas from the massive threat of poachers who kill gorillas both for zoos to have babies, and for traditional African customs. She slowly becomes close off to the world and too attached to the gorillas.Sigourney Weaver offers a very good performance, earning herself a Golden Globel. She is very believable in the role. Other actors were very competent. The director Michael Apted is a decent director, often dealing with character dramas he also directed in my option the best Pierce Bronsan Bond. He slowly builds up the film and shows what drives Dian. The film does raise a number of issues. The obvious is about the gorillas and conservation. Dian's work was really important for conservation world. But there are other issues involving corrupt government officials in Africa and how could the gorillas benefit the government, poverty and traditional beliefs in Africa and the extent to what poachers would do. If you are an animal lover or an environment you properly know what the world faces.There are problems with the film. The first 2/3rds of the film are a bit too slow and not that much happens. The third act is best when Dian starts to lose her marbles. That was the most interesting part where she becomes to devoted that she becomes blind to everything else. The Second act is okay, but the first was rather dull. The score was cheesy and very 80s. Also the cinematography could have be a lot better, especially with the African landscapes available.Its a 3 out of 5 star film.

And I've watched it for a second time now, to see if the first frustration with which I viewed it, when it was first released, had left me. No, it hadn't. It starts off poorly, with a fictionalized account of how Fossey met Louis Leakey, the famed anthropologist and how she begs him for a job. Simply not true. Fossey had already been to Africa at the time she met Leakey and he was the one who asked her to go there and work with the endangered gorillas, then numbering well under a 100. I don't even see the benefit of making this autobiographical change to the story. Fossey's motivation for going on this hazardous mission, leaving a fiancé in the U.S. is never explored. Was she is in love, as some speculate, with Leakey? Her love and interest in the gorillas is never in doubt and in real-life her obsession consumed her such that her eccentricity became sociopathic to the degree that her distrust of humans encompassed anyone who crossed her path from her students to the government of Rwanda.Her relationship with the National Geographic photographer is unfortunately Hollywoodized here and does not reach the intellectual level of harmony that they had in real life, they knew from the beginning , because of their individual interests and pursuits, that it was doomed to short-term, but celebrated the in the moment aspect of it. This could have been portrayed on screen a lot better.The shift to sociopathic personality, about halfway through the movie is too sudden to ring true and the ending feels rushed and let's get it over with already. Her murder was appalling and undeserved but she had made many enemies, not the least of whom were her students from whom she demanded servility and unquestioning obedience.Sadly, I think she was ill-served in this bio-pic, perhaps a deeper psychological exploration of her character will be made at some point.However, the gorilla filming was breathtaking.6 out of 10.

Gorrillas in the Mist aptly conveys that, though it could have been more.The only real problem is the lack of depth. The pacing is great, especially given the long history it's telling. Even though it is a little long as it is, I think that more insight could have been useful, especially when it comes to Dian's relationship with the gorilla Digit. As someone who previously knew some background on Dian, I can't say for certain how the average person would have seen the relationship between Dian and Digit (it was nothing weird at all, if that causes worry), but the short time devoted to the connection between the two probably wouldn't have given it justice, especially when compared to the other parts of Dian's life. I think another person with no prior knowledge of Dian or Digit would have thought her as weird as everyone else who knew her. Maybe that's what director Michael Apted wanted, though I highly doubt it given his attention to Dian's aggressive conservation methods.Finally, the ending is rather peculiar. It makes Dian look like a heroine, which in a way she was, as much of her research did help save the mountain gorillas from extinction. It has the adorable images of gorillas in their natural setting set to heroic memoriam music, the kind that one uses after telling the story of a fallen hero. However, this isn't such a clear cut issue. I realize that recognizing her as that is in the eye of the beholder, but even so, some of her methods were quite cruel, and especially towards the end, she wasn't a likable person at all. Additionally, it leaves a lot of the science part out (though given the target audience, this decision was probably made with good intentions). However, her methods of research were controversial, as most scientists believe that human interference should be avoided at all costs. But Dian took a radically different approach. She studied them in order to get close to them, which gave her a different perspective on their behavior.That being said, there are many parts of this film that do work. Sigourney Weaver is terrific as Dian Fossey, encompassing her soft side and her love of the gorillas, as well as her portrayal of Dian's dark side, with her explosive and near psychotic temperament. But she can't hold this movie alone. The script (especially the character) don't allow for a great deal of sympathy for Dian. In the end, I was left thinking she was a nutcase who did a lot of good things, as well as bad things. Also, she was very successful at conveying Dian's struggle with the atmosphere due to health problems, though the movie doesn't explain why.The supporting cast is great. Bryan Brown is the likable Aussie photographer who makes his relationship with Dian very believable--he loves her, even though he thinks she's a little off her rocker. John Omirah Miluwi is terrific as her sympathetic tracker. He likes her enough that he'll support her through everything, and effectively portrays the character who brings her back to reality when she needs it (which is quite often) without seeming cliché or irritating. Sometimes he seems like a father figure who is happy when his daughter is happy. He's the only person who really seems to understand Dian, which makes it easier to connect with Dian. In a sense, he's the much-needed link between Dian and the audience, so it's good that he shares the screen with Weaver almost 50/50.The production is brilliant as well. Apted makes the scenery beautiful, but he doesn't portray is as exotic as some fantasy safari, which it wasn't. He plays it straight, which is as it should be. This was about all parts of Dian, and just Dian alone. Therefore any weird and inventive camera or other kinds of tricks were not needed and thankfully were not used. The gorillas were the part that worked flawlessly. It was impossible to tell which were real or which were fake without considering that some of the close-ups had to be people in gorilla suits. Still, they moved and acted flawlessly.Even with it's faults, Gorillas in the Mist is a great film, with an interesting character study of a woman who is no doubt one of the most influential figures in ape research and conservation.

US-born Dian Fossey, a physical therapist-turned-primatologist sent to Africa by famed researcher Louis Leakey, wound up taking a fatal machete blow to the face for her efforts. And Sigourney Weaver turns in a stunning performance as the aggressive conservation warrior, who, at age 53, was buried with the apes she had scrupulously studied and imitated in order to gain trust and access.This film portrays Fossey as beyond-belief patient and nurturing toward the gorillas but brutal toward any human who stood in the way of her cause. At one particularly disturbing point in the film, she terrorizes an African boy left behind by poachers as she uses a scary mask and a Snickers bar to extract information about the bad guys' whereabouts. At another point, she drops a noose around a captured poacher's neck, only to let him collapse to the ground instead of being hanged. After reading about Fossey on Wikipedia, I'm unclear about how much of her organization survives today. Apparently, the Rwandan genocide of the Nineties resulted in a trashing of at least some of the operations she had established.I can't help but think that Fossey, at least as she is portrayed in this movie, went way overboard in the way in which she approached her life's work. Her goals were certainly worthy, but her take-no-prisoners approach toward dissenters was bound to backfire eventually.There are touching scenes in this film that portray Fossey as supremely gentle and giving, as when she coaxes an orphaned baby traumatized by a poachers' raid into eating a blackberry.

She is portrayed as an intelligent well-educated researcher who is metamorphosed into literally a Gorilla thumper who decides that the mountain and the Gorillas that live there are now her own personal property.  It is sort of like when a person is an obsessed fan or enthusiast  of someone or something then they meet up with someone who has the same interest they do. They tend to become hostile towards that person thinking that this other fan or enthusiast is a threat or doesn't have the right to be a fan or enthusiast.  Fosse is portrayed the same way here with her Gorilla obsession.  The real Dianne Fosse no doubt made some very serious and dangerous enemies and in the end paid the price.  This film left me with a `Well she got what she deserved'  I totally applaud Sigourney Weaver and the  courage she displayed as an actress by getting that close to actual real live Gorillas during the filming, but I don't think the real Dianne Fosse became the wacko as she was portrayed in this motion picture.

That said, I found this movie to be pretty standard slightly-campy weekday afternoon HBO fare, circa 1993. The idea that it could be up for Oscars boggles my mind. Until I read the other comments here, I had little idea of what ACTUALLY happened, and what was just Hollywood embellishment to sell more tickets. The sexual tension was cookie-cutter, the relationship was cookie-cutter, and I seriously doubt both the platonic-to-sex-in-60-seconds scene and the fact that the two would furiously and frequently make out like inebriated high school freshmen. Almost no backstory of her life is given, save a picture of her fiancé - at least the way the movie leaves it, I seriously doubt that the two could go immediately form cheating on their loved ones to joyfully filming gorillas without any guilt whatsoever. I'm unsure to what degree the insensitivity to African culture was Fossey's, and to what degree it was the filmmakers', but I'd imagine that Fossey was close enough to her assistant (I'd remember the name, but he never is given much attention) that the character shouldn't be left so flat and secondary in the telling of the story. The cinematography seems both uninspiring and riddled with clichés - the views in the background are beautiful, but they weren't actually created by the filmmakers now, were they? The best three things that you can say about this movie are that 1. It raises awareness of Fossey's life and the issues that mattered to her, 2. The scenery is beautiful, and 3. The scenes with the gorillas were all quite realistic.

Sigourney Weaver gives the role plenty of energy (mostly by over-acting shamelessly), but the film suffers from too many tactical errors, beginning with a childishly simple script that reduces complex issues into one-dimensional conflicts between corrupt humankind and the unspoiled splendor of animal life in the wild. Critical moments are further undermined by gratuitous voice-over letters home and by Maurice Jarre's overwrought (and therefore not entirely inappropriate) music score. Even the expected romantic interest between Fossey and a handsome National geographic photographer is given the regulation Hollywood screen treatment, proving yet again that sincere intentions are never enough to salvage a trite and superficial film. "},{"Title":"Loved the gorillas - but the film felt like an infomercial","Date":"9 February 2008","Score":"2 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Biography, Drama","Review":" The true story of Dian Fossey is something that should have been so easy to make into a great and intelligent film. The petty politics of science and academia, the development of the devil's deal that is African eco-tourism, the sociology of our nearest relatives - a complex web of interactions that ultimately lead to the mysterious murder of the protagonist. But this was way too deep for the movie machinery to handle.Hollywood does not understand scientists, their passions, their pettiness, their motivations - so it just ignores this and turns Fossey into a Kurtz-like figure and fabricated a unloved woman sub-plot to explain her descent into darkness.Hollywood couldn't be bothered to try to portray the intricate politics between Fossey, her funders, her students and the Africans with whom she worked. Instead we get the standard, if slightly more enlightened white man's burthen depiction.As for the gorillas - there was no need to explore, however briefly, some of the insights that Fossey obtained about gorilla society and why these creatures deserve protection. It was far easier to just create a van der Villain figure that murdered gorillas and kidnapped cute babies.No, this wasn't supposed to be a documentary but this shouldn't have been turned into a Grizzly Adams infomercial to save ape babies either.As for positives, the photography was stunning and the gorillas were very touching and human-like. However, there is a great and fascinating story that could have provided great insight the science and politics of the conservation movement. Unfortunately, this film didn't tell it.

Well, Sigourney Weaver did just that, she went and did her own monkey movie! I am not saying it's bad, it's just a curious oddity. Weaver plays Dian Fosse, a total controlling megalmaniac if there was one, who goes down to deepest darkest Africa to study Monkeys. There, while grunting like the monkeys while they climb all over her, she meets poachers, tribesmen, warring troops, and Bryan Brown, all of which may not be a good thing. Brown plays a National Geographic photographer who basically waltzes in and out of the film. I am actually glad Weaver didn't win the Oscar for this, as it seems now to be too forced, too LOOK AT ME! I'M CHEWING LEAVES NOW! scene chewing. I sorta liked this movie, and gosh darn it, I'm gonna compare this to Mommie Dearest in the eye-bulging-for-an-oscar department for weaver's performance alone.

It could have risen to an 8. Then again it could have sunk to a 1. Or a zero.The best words to describe it are clunky, awkward, clumsy and uninspired. Sigourney Weaver (who I think is a terrific actress most of the time) is terrible here. I couldn't tell if she was going for camp comedy or melodrama, but it had to be one of the two. Her delivery was either wooden or awkwardly over the top. John Waters likely would not have allowed it, his movies have a consistency and flow to them, regardless of whether or not you are drawn to the subject matter.Granted, the script doesn't help and the director seems to be on auto-pilot.I'm also never a big fan of movies that depict ignorant foreigners entering a culture and loudly and brashly disrupting it and becoming very indignant when they can't walk all over it and subvert it for their own needs, despite centuries of culture being at stake. This kind of lack of sensitivity and tunnel vision tends to remind me of the attitudes that precluded slavery.I do however, give the film 2 points for beautiful cinematography, and one point for the acting of Weaver's friend who seems quite believable as a loyal friend and guide who sees the bigger picture but is powerless to impart this wisdom to Fossey. I took off the film (for a second time) about halfway through, just as Bryan Brown's character arrived, and he had only spouted a few clichés before I took it off again, so my I've made no judgement of that actor.The late 80's was a time of smug, disposable movies being churned out. Thank god it's over, (although some say it's coming back again) but you still be burned at the video store, and of course for a few hours of your time. I escaped with only one hour wasted.
