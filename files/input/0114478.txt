[{"Title":"A beautiful depiction of humanity","Date":"21 October 2002","Score":"61 out of 64 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":" It's such a sad old feeling, the fields are soft and green, it's memories that I'm stealing, but you're innocent when you dream, when you dream, you're innocent when you dream ---Tom Waits Smoke is a very difficult film to describe because it does not unfold with a coherent narrative, but rather with slice-of-life vignettes about chance, communication, and inter-connectedness. Author Paul Auster and director Wayne Wang (The Joy Luck Club) worked on the story for years before it reached the screen and the collaboration produces a highly literate, novelistic cinema that is divided into separate chapters, each elaborating a different character. I have seen this small masterpiece many times, but I keep watching it because I love its celebration of the simple pleasures of life friendships, good conversation, and, of course, smoking a good cigar. Smoke is not a complex or experimental film, just a beautiful and simple delineation of humanity.Harvey Keitel plays Auggie Wren, the owner of a small cigar store in Brooklyn. An amateur photographer as well as a raconteur of tall tales, Auggie has taken one photograph a day from the street corner outside his store every day for the past 14 years. People say you have to travel to see the world,'' Auggie says. Sometimes I think that if you just stay in one place and keep your eyes open, you're going to see just about all that you can handle.'' When a friend comments that all the snapshots look alike, Auggie points out the differences the light, the season, and the look on people's faces. It's all a matter of slowing down, Auggie says, being in present time, and observing what is in front of you.One of the store's regular customers is writer Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) who hasn't published a novel since his wife died a few years ago in an incident of street violence. When a young Black man, Rashid Cole, (Harold Perrineau Jr.) saves Paul's life by pulling him away from on an oncoming car, Paul offers him a place to sleep. The lives of the two become intertwined in the young man's encounter with some robbers and in his search for his father, brilliantly played by Forrest Whitaker. When Auggie's former lover, Ruby (Stockard Channing), shows up, she tells Auggie he has a pregnant daughter (Ashley Judd) that now needs his help. These incidents come together in a powerful, fully realized conclusion.Although Smoke has its moments of high drama, it is mostly a low-key, slice-of-life type of film that depicts events in life as happening for a purpose, not as random or chance occurrences. The characters are not movie colorful, but ordinary down-to-earth people brought to realization by a flawless ensemble cast. The film reaches a sublime conclusion in a tender Christmas story narrated by Keitel and supported by Tom Waits' haunting song Innocent When You Dream. Everyone ends up in a better place than when they started, including myself as viewer.

Smoke is one such film.Although there's nothing particularly special about each of several main characters, seemingly picked at random off of a New York street corner, they come off as noble, even heroic, in spite of the fact that their collective problems amount to nothing more than the usual garden variety.  The main character, for example (Auggie Wren, played by Harvey Keitel) is a tobacconist around whose shop the main characters revolve.  He has an unusual habit  every morning, at the same time of the day, he photographs the same street corner, and puts the pictures together in a series of albums.  It's time-lapse photography on an enormous scale.  He can't explain why he does it.  He just needs to do it.  And it's a really marvelous device for delivering the movie's main theme  everything that matters, all the meaning in the world that can be condensed from holy books and vows and catechisms and poems, is right there before us.  We just need to have the eyes to see it.  The things we tend to dismiss as prosaic, out of familiarity, emerge from the pages of his album as special, wonderful, enchanted.  There's a great line in the movie about how Sir Walter Raleigh measured the weight of smoke.  He took a cigar, weighed it, smoked it, and weighed the ash.  The difference between the cigar and the ash was the weight of the smoke.  Although he new nothing of the chemistry of combustion, he did the best that he could, based upon what he knew.  Likewise, Smoke is a movie about people with limited knowledge and perspective.  Their assumptions are often wrong;  but, they do the best that they can.  A small, seemingly insignificant piece of information can, and does, change everything.

They are sympathetic with their small weaknesses and their daily problems. The movie gives a realistic description of the daily life of ordinary people in Brooklyn. Brooklyn has the star role. In fact the movie seems like a declaration of love to this city, although when compared to Woody Allen's Manhattan, the approach is completely different.The message is in a way surprising (maybe because of my European bias) Even in this money driven, rough, fast living, time-is-money, urban and individualistic environment there is a lot of love, friendship and humanity. Humanity means also that we do things which eventually do not make very much sense, are not logical and which may be very emotional. Smoking belongs to such activities. It is an activity which needs a work break. It gives us an opportunity for a stop and for starting rethinking issues. Therefore the small cigar shop, which appears like an island within a stormy ocean, like the antipode to the bustle environment.Sometimes some of the hurry enters the shop, but the clocks seem to tick differently there and at the end everything calms down. I like this movie.

I watched Smoke several times without getting bored and still I sometimes watch some scenes. The characters are so real and the dialogs are so natural that I feel like I meet my friends or a part of my family when I watch it. I feel like if I went to Brooklyn, I would find that tobacco shop with Auggie sitting at the desk, chatting with others.The beautiful scenes are also unforgettable&#133; The first scene where Paul tells about the weight of smoke&#133; The scene where Auggie says that the light, season and people are different in the photos that he takes every day&#133; I also love the end, where Auggie tells the Christmas story to Paul and the white-black scene with the song of Tom Waits.When you watch the movie, you understand that it is just the little things - a chat with your friend, a moment of happiness, a Christmas story told at lunch, a photo- and the feelings in life that matters. That's why maybe we feel so happy and relaxed when we watch the movie We forget about the daily stress and want to be a part of Auggie Wren's world.

I don´t even know how to describe it to someone, i guess it´s undescribable. It´s one of those rare movies that it has to be felt. If you don´t feel it, then you are missing the whole point. SMOKE is one of those rare movies which we don´t know how to recommend this to our friends, because it´s so original and simple that there is nothing to describe. Anything we might say ,it only will give the illusion this is an shallow or boring movie. SMOKE is not an adventure, not a drama, not a comedy, not a cops movie, not an action movie, so what it´s about ?!! It´s about life. But in a real way, and surprisingly not boring.This movie is very similar to Luc Besson´s - Le Gran Bleu (The Big Blue). The story it has nothing to do with it, but it´s a movie to also be felt.This is an actors movie, and they all do an incredible job. Sometimes they make us want to go to New York and go talk with them. Then we remember that they are not real, and we wished they were. Harvey Keitel and William Hurt are perfect in their characters and it´s a joy to watch them act. The movie could be only both of them talking to to each other, that it would still be a great and not boring movie.This is a very well writen, acted and directed script, and we don´t find many of this everyday. And it has a fantastic soundtrack also that fits perfectly in the story. The final scenes with a Tom Waits song are realy poetic. The music almost becomes a character in the movie.Beautiful, beautiful movie. Unmissable !By the way, if you can, watch the sequel also, because it´s as good as the original. It´s called Blue in the face. Don´t miss it.SMOKE is a magnificent movie.

Like Mike Leigh's Life is Sweet a few years back, it closely observes the day-to-day lives of a handful of people, in this case the patrons of and workers in a Brooklyn cigar shop, and leaves it at that. Don't expect The Moral to come creeping into the dialogue; the fact that the lives of Auggie Wren (Harvey Keitel, in another example of why he's the best actor working today) and his friends are compelling IS the point. Writer Paul Auster, basing his script on his op-ed story in The New York Times, keeps on chugging out smartly-written people even up to the seventh and eighth character. It's a rare treat to have an ensemble movie in which there isn't a single weak performance, and even rarer to have one supported by writing and directing that are up to the task. All of these elements come together come together in Smoke, an artful story about the art of storytelling.

It's also a film about the importance of family and friends in defining who we are. Such subjects could be the recipe for an over-sentimental disaster in less capable hands, but Wang delivers a film that manages to be genuinely heartwarming while remaining relatively sentiment-free.Centred around the tobacco shop of Auggie (Harvey Keitel), a man with a long-term obsession with photographing the same street corner at exactly the same time every day, Paul Auster's screenplay introduces us to a number of seemingly nondescript characters who all have something to contribute to the meaning of the story. There is Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) a successful writer unable to produce anything of worth since the tragic death of his wife three years before; Thomas Cole (Harold Perrineau) a young man on the run and searching for the father (Forrest Whitaker, giving a first-class performance) who abandoned him and his mother; and Auggie himself, who receives a visit from an ex-girlfriend (Stockard Channing) who claims he is the father of her junkie daughter(a truly monstrous creation from Ashley Judd). The stories intertwine, although, as with life itself, they are not all satisfactorily resolved, and the entire cast give solid performances. Even Harvey Keitel, not usually one of my favourite actors, manages to rise above his workmanlike talents to deliver a sublime performance.

As a man who considers himself someone who likes to explore his depths, yet is considered shallow by much of our modern jargon (communicate your feelings, open up, etc, etc) it has been apparent to me that men DO express their feelings to one another, in very different ways, and often much more subtle and deep ways than our modern culture gives us credit for...

I wouldn't say that the film advertises itself as this, but then again, nor does life... and yet here we are, no?

The philosophical issue is whether you think your life has meaning, starts at the beginning, goes to the end, and you get your reward; or whether you think your life is a series of happenstances that may not be related at all to what's gone before and that you don't build on, but go through and learn from. Maybe.Keitel plays Auggie, the owner of the smoke shop, and the cast of characters comes into his store and his life, and they smoke and tell stories. Most of the stories work - some of them are told, but many of them are 'shown' as the character spins the yarn. Some of the stories didn't work for me, but the promise of more kept me hanging in.This is a quiet movie, a thinker's movie. If you've lived a life that's had its ups and downs, you'll fit right in.

The film is divided in chapters, each focussing on a different character. It isn't done randomly as all the down to earth characters are part of the story. 'Smoke' has a whimsical touch to it. It looks like a simplistic painting or a photograph that tells the story of one's daily life and their certain unique circumstances. The movie looks authentic. It does not have the typical Hollywood glossy feel to it. It's more like a walk down the lives of these simple yet wonderful characters. Harvey Keitel is terrific as the cigar store owner and amateur photographer. William Hurt is equally remarkable as a writer who hasn't published a novel since the demise of his wife. Harold Perrineau Jr. holds his own as the young Rashid Cole who forms a friendship with Hurt's Paul Benjamin and Keitel's Augie Wren. Forest Whitaker is excellent as Cole's hardworking father with one arm and Stockard Channing is great as Augie's former lover. The cinematography is simplistic and yet it works brilliantly and the soundtrack itself is another huge plus as it gives voice to the mood of the scene. The visuals of the city only add to the charm.

It shares a lot of traits with this wave of films great actors, somewhat affected dialogue, a shaky portrayal of race and a distinct sense of machismo (although not nearly as nauseating as, say, Swingers). Where Smoke differs is in rejecting the violent nihilism that often haunted this decade. Instead, this is a story about communities forming and the minor miracle that is everyday survival.Smoke is ostensibly centred around an ordinary corner smoke shop in New York City. We follow the shop, and the people around it, over the course of a year. There's a really laudable desire here to tell the story of a social environment rather than an individualist narrative. This is a goal that the film never quite fulfills, meandering into some fairly standard family drama with a refreshing lack of narrative closure. Even when the scenario would suggest melodrama, the overall focus of the film is not on what happens to our protagonists but the bonds that form between them.The performances are as great as you would expect from reading the cast list, although Stockard Channing's character is too underwritten for her to really shine. The script is by novelist Paul Auster, eschewing most of his postmodern experimentation for street-level human drama. (There is still a novelist named Paul with a dead wife, so I guess some things never change). Auster's dialogue is usually authentic-sounding, save for the tendency to drift into stagey monologues that never really justify themselves.As a film, Smoke is something of a failure -- it's unable to create the sense of place it aims for without relying on hoary story lines and drama. But there's also a lot to like about the film, from the brilliant cast to the relaxed pace. It's not all it could be, but it still deserves a look.

Basically the plot revolves around characters associated in some way with each other and a cigar store in New York, all these characters and subplots are woven together and drift and swirl like ethereal smoke from a cigar. Augustus 'Auggie' Wren (Harvey Keitel) is the manager of the store who has developed a project where he photographs the same spot outside his store at the same time every day, and nothing in his day to day life changes until past flame Ruby McNutt (Stockard Channing) comes visiting. Paul Benjamin (William Hurt) is a writer suffering from writer's block, and he is introduced to young African American drifter 'Rashid', real name Thomas Cole (Lost's Harold Perrineau) who saves his life, and he allows the young man to stay with him, while at the same time trying to find something to write about. Ruby comes to tell Auggie that she gave birth to a daughter, and that he is the father, and she wants some money, a few thousand, to help her struggling daughter Felicity (Ashley Judd) who is addicted to alcohol and drugs, and after some time he does help her. Rashid hides a package in Paul's apartment, this is money that he stole from criminal The Creeper (Malik Yoba), who does find the apartment and threaten Paul at gunpoint before being arrested, Rashid is trying to better himself, he manages to get a job in the cigar store, and he also hangs around outside the garage of mechanic Cyrus (Forest Whitaker), who lost his left arm in a car crash with his wife. Rashid, aka Thomas, will not reveal to Cyrus that he is his son, so Paul and Auggie go along with him to the garage, and the truth does come out, Cyrus is at first very angry, but the argument settles during a lunch with him and his new family. The final scene sees Auggie with Paul in a café telling him a story that he could use in a new Christmas themed book, and he tells a story of how a young man stole from his store, dropped his wallet, and some time later he tried to return it, an old lady answered and being blind assumed it was the young man, he went along with it and spent Christmas together, before leaving he took a camera from a pile in the bathroom, and when Auggie returned the next year she had died, a silent montage sees that this tale was true. Also starring Giancarlo Esposito as Tommy, José Zúñiga as Jerry and Stephen Gevedon as Dennis. The cast all do their parts very well, Keitel being cool and collected, Hurt being concerned and suppressed, Perrineau being mysterious and likable, Channing being needy and sporting an eye-patch, and Judd being feisty and nasty. There is no specific story, but the plot is all put together very well, how the characters connect together in some way is clever, the writing is witty and all the dialogue is engaging, it reminded me of something like Clerks, a near one location film where all you need is talking, it is a really interesting a most watchable drama.

One wonders, most of the time, where Wayne Wang and his writer wanted to go, what was the message they wanted to deliver trough these story lines, often composed of laborious and contrived dialogues, that hardly combine, that all lack substance and that even sometimes turn out to be frankly uninteresting as Auggie's ex-wife. The latter, embodied by the excellent Harvey Keitel, is, by the way, the most touching and interesting character, behind the best scene in the movie when he tells his unexpected Christmas to his friend Paul. A certain sincerity emerges from Smoke but it is not enough to compensate for the lacks of this pseudo comedy-drama.

While it has its moments, the script is ridiculously contrived, a lackluster mixture of forced sentimentality and pretentious dialog. It is billed as a comedy, but there are no laughs to be had here. The relationships among the characters are not at all believable. There are also subplots, such as the one involving Keitel's ex-wife (Channing in a thankless role) and daughter (Judd in an early role), that are pointless. The acting is uneven, ranging from good (Keitel) to bad (Whitaker) to awful (some of the actors in small roles). Keitel is particularly good in relating a Christmas story.

As parts of a major film work, the sketches seem fleeting, pregnant, yet ultimately unrealized propositions.Whatever Wayne Wang is attempting here, he does a fine job of keeping the secret.  A cross somewhere between updated Saroyan and O'Neill, this production offers a cast of thorough professionals giving convincing, though seldom moving, renditions--at least to this viewer.Certainly a film which will have both admirers and detractors.  In this case, the later rules.Among the cast notables are William Hurt and Stockard Channing.

Also, burning produces heat and light and usually where there is heat and light, some amount of electricity is invariably involved and though we may assume that the initial compound of masses is totally non-conducting and the resulting compound of masses is also non-conducting, yet unfortunately air is conducting, and does transmit and carry electricity, static or otherwise. In this process of burning, clearly some amount of energy is transformed into heat and light which can only come from the energy of those masses themselves, not to ignore that different masses burn at different rates, consuming different amounts of oxygen and emitting different amounts of heat and light or at different temperatures and with different luminescence. Unless the conditions are always the same the burning may not always be the same and how the compound burns will depend on that and it will clearly depend on how the compound is formed as well.If the masses are actually joined and connected at an atomic level, then the rate or other characteristics of burning of the compound may not be readily related to the same characteristics of burning of its constituent individual elements or masses separately. Now clearly since the energy due to heat and light must come from the original compound of masses alone, the final mass of the compound can only be determined after one has accounted for the actual loss in energy due to heat and light.

Heavily improvisational--yet only intermittently interesting--Smoke managed to create a small cult with audiences and critics, although neither the actors nor Paul Auster (the credited screenwriter) have anything important to say. It's imperative in a talking-heads movie like this to create a beguiling inner-sanctum, a small universe within this store with its rapidly changing groups, but Wang only gets strong scenes out of Harvey Keitel and Ashley Judd. Some interesting bits and pieces (and a moving finish) make the picture worthwhile for art-films fans. Followed by the sequel Blue In The Face in 1995. ** from **** "},{"Title":"Yawn Extravaganza","Date":"30 July 2001","Score":"1 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Drama","Review":"  When I first heard that this movie had Harvey Keitel, William Hurt, and Forest Whitaker in it, I salivated. I just knew it was going to be great! What a yawn fest! The acting was fine, but the plot was dull and in some instances pointless. The concept is unique, but I found myself wondering why everyone had to be so vague! I usually like vague movies, but this one wasn't very concrete. This is a very slow moving movie!

This movie is billed on the box as a comedy, with enthusiastic endorsements of its comedic qualities excerpted from reviews. There is absolutely nothing faintly humorous about it. It is strictly a dark, pseudo-realistic portrait of New York City life. Having endured the whole thing - i borrowed it from the library and still regret it - I wonder what the reviewers were smoking. This is one of those movies where the cover, especially the photo, bears absolutely no relation to the movie. Bottom line it seems to be a fad exploitation of the momentary fascination with cigars. Sometimes a cigar isn't worth smoking.

Watching it again ten years later I am rather shocked that I could ever have enjoyed it, and that so many fine actors could have been fooled as well. Strip them away and you are left with a sentimental TV special for bored housewives, and on those terms I suppose it could be enjoyed as a pleasant waste of time. Still, it makes mediocre indie slice-of-life movies like Twenty Bucks or Clerks seem like masterpieces, and is not even in the same universe as the films of Jarmusch or Altman (I would particularly recommend Jarmusch's Night on Earth to people who think they love Smoke).

It turns out none of us was enjoying it.   It was the most boring piece of pretentious garbage I have ever sat through in a movie theatre.  There was no plot, to speak of,  just a series of 'episodes,  and it seemed like most of the inane dialogue was improvised.   The worst detail was Forest Whitaker's fake hook,  which was about 12 inches longer than his  good arm.  What a joke !!  This looked like some NYU film student's senior project.

I fell asleep in the middle. Or is this just some pseudo-intellectual clap trap? Just for the record, I used to live in NYC. But I don't like stare-at-your-navel movies about New York any more than the ones about California and Hollywood.And what really irks me is that the cover of the video portrays the movie as a light-hearted comedy. It is anything but. Apparently, even the film studio could bear to watch it through to the end.I understand I have to write at least 10 lines about a movie to qualify as a review. This is a challenge in this case.On the plus side, the cast is excellent. There is nothing particularly wrong with the acting, aside from the fact that the movie is basically pointless and boring. And since I borrowed the movie from the library, I didn't have to pay to watch it. By the way, I once interviewed Harvey Keitel, who was doing - get this - an Italian movie set in eastern Canada that was being filmed in Alaska. He was some sort of bear hunter searching for a buddy lost somewhere near the North Pole or something, and he was getting on the train to go find him. And the train he was getting on was in Anchorage. Right.I didn't have the heart to point out that there was no rail line to the Arctic, in either eastern Canada or Alaska.I wonder what ever became of this movie? As far as I can tell from IMDb, it was never released. Not that I know Italian.
