Call it limited-release. But it's a lot more entertaining and intelligent than 95 percent of what Hollywood produces these days. (I know this was filmed primarily in New Jersey, but you know where I'm coming from.)The psychological and physical tension between the two leading characters (Channing and Stiles) really makes this film. There's a lot to think about here, including the price to be paid for corporate success and how trust often ends up being the world's most valuable commodity.Anyone who's ever reached the top of the corporate ladder and then found themselves to tired to enjoy it will appreciate Channing's performance. She's a perfect fit for this role, strong and confident on one hand but insecure and a tad lonely on the other.It seems strange to say it, but I really liked something about how the culture of business travel was illustrated in the movie -- hotel bars, shuttle buses, cell phones, neatly-organized suitcases, lounges, alarm clocks. Maybe these characters simply have more impact in such an artificial environment.A solid 8 1/2 out of 10.

It is a small, but key part of the story. Their improvised scheme involves drugging him, taking him to a semi-public place, stripping him of his clothes and writing obscenities all over his body. Sexual humiliation, with the intent of leaving him shamed and degraded. A symbolic rape, as it were. But, they only strip him to his underwear. Why? Since the point of their actions is revenge and humiliation, then why not strip him naked? And why leave his clothes behind? As is, the poor guy wakes up, cleans up, dresses and apparently goes on like nothing happened. Instead of being a violation of his psyche as much as his body, the incident proves to be little more than a fraternity prank of no real consequence. The film wants to show the women doing a bad thing, but not bad enough to lose viewer sympathy.That is the problem with this artsy, but feather-weight film It never goes far enough. This man, who, up until he is taken advantage of, appears to be a cordial and sympathetic businessman, is cruelly victimized for no real reason, yet he doesn't seem to suffer anything more than a little bit of confusion. One of the women involved in the stunt is a newly chosen CEO of a major corporation and she seems a bit embarrassed at finding out she has been duped into risking her entire career for nothing, but that's all. The other woman, who devised this pseudo-sexual assault as a way of humiliating the first woman, doesn't even seem to get any great pleasure out of her petty manipulations. We see an act of kidnapping and sexual assault -- felonies -- but it seems to be meaningless, even though it becomes the focal point of the film.Stockard Channing is Julie, the executive. Julia Stiles is Paula, a corporate underling who has displeased Julie and was subsequently fired. Forced to stay at a generic airport hotel while on an out-of-town business trip, the two get to know each other. Part of this emotional, semi-feminist, pseudo-lesbian bonding includes targeting Nick (Frederick Weller), a corporate head hunter and a business acquaintance of Julie's. Being a male, Nick presumably represents a common opponent for the women, which is amplified to the level of enemy when Paula maliciously labels him as a rapist as well.The film embraces a feminist mindset, then debunks it. Three quarters of the film seems to suggest that Julie and Paula have a bond simply because they are both women -- even though they have little else in common -- and this culminates in their assault on Nick. The film also plays on the expectations of the audience, which has been conditioned to assume that women have a special bond and are justified at any act of rage against men (the Thelma & Louise syndrome). But, as we see, the abuse of Nick is not justified and is based on a myth that the mere suggestion of rape unites all women. In fact, this supposed gender bond allows Julie to trust Paula, who she has known for less than 24 hours -- and has already revealed herself to be exploitive and dishonest -- over Nick, a long-time associate who shows Julie nothing but friendliness and support. The film's twist reveals that the two women really don't have any unique sisterhood at all, and Paula was exploiting a feminist myth. Indeed, Julie seems to have done quite well in the man's world of business and really has more in common with Nick than with Paula.But, having the nerve to take on an anti-feminist position, the film backs away from it timidly. Nick is victimized, but not too much. Julie betrays Nick, but not to the point where it costs her anything; indeed, even though she treats Nick despicably, the film tries to makes us more sorry for Julie. Though the film falls short of showing Paula to be evil or psychotic, it sidesteps her obvious hatred of men in favor of her sexual and social jealousy and resentment of Julie. Gender politics propels the story, but remains only an understated theme in the narrative.As a character study, the film is not so bad. Channing is, as always, the picture of natural acting grace and subtlety. As Julie, she is always prepared for the worse to happen and is emotionally unprepared for enjoying life when it doesn't. Stiles is properly uncomfortable to watch as the perpetually duplicitous Paula, but her character never makes much sense. It is not believable that someone so irresponsible would end up assisting a high-powered executive. Maybe she is meant to be Julie's alter ego; a representation of Julie as a younger woman, or symbolic of Julie's pent up rage and resentment against men. Either way, she is less a person than a plot contrivance. Weller has the thankless job of being just an ordinary guy whose actions are open to interpretation. If he is innocent, he has our sympathy; if he is guilty the women have our empathy. The film lacks the courage to play the character either way, and Weller himself is left walking a tightrope for the benefit of the plot, making Nick seem oddly untrustworthy, even though he is given nothing to do or say that would support this.THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS looks good and has solid performances. But like the shiny glass and chrome world it portrays, it is all superficial veneer. The action goes too far to make it merely a character study, but not far enough to make it a psychological thriller. It is a film that seems to be greatly angry about something, but is too unsure of itself to fully vent its rage.

The story, to me, anyway, is completely implausible. I just didn't believe a woman with the controlled personality of a CEO could be so easily drawn in to such a dumb prank. And once I found myself disbelieving that, I didn't buy anything else that happened in the film. The film also glosses over the implications of what Julia Stiles' character does - the guy could easily have died from the drug overdose. I suppose some people will interpret the ending as Stiles' character, the cold, manipulative bitch, beating the CEO at her own game, but I didn't see that at all. She just struck me as a man-hater, a lonely, lost little girl.This movie is also far from original. It contains too many elements from better movies I've seen before, notably In The Company Of Men. Even the best lines of dialogue in the movie are an utter clich√©, when Stiles and Stockard Channing are swapping Ok, you told me what I am, now I'm going to tell you what you are barbs. The performances are all great; it's just the material that's lacking. The Business of Strangers is not terrible, but it's weak, and it trivializes not only the plight of women in the corporate workplace, but rape victims as well.

Rather improbably, the two hatch plans to assault and sexually humiliate the young male recruiter (Weller) for no apparent reason other than antipathy to his masculinity, also lodged in their hotel. This procedure is a very risky business indeed, as the young man could have a fatal reaction to the alarming combination of drugs and alcohol foisted on him. Viewers should become very edgy as this sequence of mean-spirited events transpires with the never remote possibility of dire consequences ensuing.  By film's end,ironically, the hapless male victim is the only one of the three who remains unscathed and left with his innocence relatively intact through unconsciousness.  The new female CEO, however, is now left to face some disturbing and unpleasant truths about herself.

I write short stories about things that I experience. Nonfiction. Fiction is too stupid, too neat. I like the sloppiness of real life. What we don't know at the time is that Paula is about to improvise just such a tale involving Julie, a tale that challenges the middle-aged executive's lifestyle and her assumptions about herself and inspires her to do things she wouldn't normally do.This is the business of strangers. And this is the story within the story. Paula is the diabolical kind of person who is dedicated to introducing people to themselves so that she can watch them twist, a privileged, under-achieving Ivy League girl with machinations. Julie is a community college workaholic who never had time for a family, or love, or self-discovery, a lonely woman whose life is a parade of sterile hotel rooms, anonymous strangers, alcohol and pills. Although the story drags in a little in spots, the overall effect is edgy and fascinating, and the contrast between the principals keeps us wondering who is going to come out on top.The action really begins when Julie, in an expansive mood with some booze and her promotion to CEO, shows some interest in the girl she just fired for being late to a presentation. It's not clear what sort of interest that is. Julie responds as a spider coaxing a fly into the web, but it's not clear what she's up to. They go to the pool and play around, get on the treadmills at the gym and run. They go back to Julie's suite and drink some more.At this point I'm afraid that the film will deteriorate into a politically correct clich√© of some kind, or a lesbian wish-fulfillment debacle, without anything really happening. Enter (or actually re-enter) Nick Harris (Fred Weller) who, Paula has confided to Julie, raped her best friend when they were undergraduates in Boston. This excites Julie's loathing and so the two women play out an improvised and drunken revenge scenario that is a bit over the top, but psychologically correct.After some intense emotional interaction, the film resolves surprisingly and rather neatly, allowing us to see that Paula has indeed spun out a tale whose moral might be, watch out for young foxes. The scene in the airport emphasizes this, with Julie and Nick sheepishly sorting out last night's bizarre debauchery while trying to maintain their dignity, with Paula poised brazenly in plain sight wearing earphones, a smug silhouette in the distance.Patrick Stettner wrote the script, which, judging from the series of stationary settings and the limited cast, I suspect was originally a stage play. He also directed in a business-like manner, getting a saucy and smirk-laden performance from Stiles, whose originality and talent is obvious, and a steady and believable one from veteran Channing. Incidentally, Channing is a Harvard graduate who is perhaps best known for her performance as Betty Rizzo in Grease (1978) playing a teenager when she was 32-years-old! Here she braves some close camera work that starkly reveals the 57-year-old actress beneath the makeup. Yet, as always, Stockard Channing pleases us.But see this for Julia Stiles, a thoroughly professional player, whose arrogant, sneering, and edgy style add spice to, and partially disguise, her youthful mastery of the fine art of acting.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

To take just the most obvious example, in the sauna Paula reveals that she has gone through Julie's medication and that this is something she always does. Clearly it's unthinkable that Julie could have any confidence in Paula's reliability after that. Julie's behaviour is odd, to say the least, and I'd like to suggest an explanation.Julie is indulging a fantasy of loss of control, with Paula's assistance. If this sounds implausible, consider the following exchange. At a crucial point, Paula expresses surprise that Julie hides from the security guard I thought you wanted to get caught. You know--the excitement of being exposed and humiliated. Maybe a little rough stuff. I mean that's why we're here, isn't it? Julie retorts that they're there because Paula is a profoundly disturbed young woman. Paula's reply is significant Oh, please. If you were a man you'd see a dominatrix twice a week. All CEOs have one. But we're women, so we don't do things like that. We express issues of doubt and control differently.Julie certainly has issues of doubt and control. When a board meeting is called without her knowledge, she assumes that it's because she's going to be fired. When instead she's promoted to CEO, the sense of anticlimax is palpable. She's going to celebrate, but how? Before the promotion, her job title was Vice-President but in fact she was just a highly effective but insecure salesperson. What's changed? Why, in these circumstances, would Julie wish to act out a fantasy of loss of control? I suggest that we often fantasize about what we fear most -- to reassure ourselves that we could cope with it if we had to.(So-called SPOILERS from this point on. Don't read any more if you don't want to know what happens.) Because it is just a fantasy, Julie never actually loses control. That's why nothing very bad happens. Julie loses money that she can apparently afford, but she doesn't get caught, fired or arrested and in the end she knows that no permanent damage has been done to Nick. (Is Paula to be believed about the number of Valium she'd given Nick? Why on earth would she suddenly start telling the truth at that point?) Finally, she's not going to change her life. Take this job away and I'm not sure what's left. It's the fact that Julie doesn't change that accounts for the dissatisfaction of a number of reviewers. The reviewer on film.guardian.co.uk, who reviewed this film in the same week as Baise Moi, described it as Baise Moi Lite, presumably because the antics that we watch have no real consequences. In that respect, this film reminded me a little of Fincher's The Game (1997). The status quo is left undisturbed. There's something a little smug about the ending.I have to say, however, that this is a much better film than The Game. It's better because, while Nicholas Van Orton's power and wealth are beyond question, Julie's are relative and precarious. The status quo that is apparently restored (and that was never actually under threat) was a much less comfortable one to begin with. There is something at stake, though it isn't what you might have thought at first.The people who've suggested that Paula acts as she does out of a desire for revenge are wide of the mark. She may be appalling and selfish, but she's not stupid. If she wanted to punish Julie, she could do a better job than this. When she threatens to start singing, Julie apparently calls her bluff. But there's no reason why Paula should have been bluffing. When she tells Julie that she has almost nothing to lose by being caught, the reasons she gives are valid. So why doesn't she sing? Because Julie is the boss -- or perhaps, the client -- and the boss gets to decide how far the game will go.Consider the kind of person Paula is. She's young and pretty, she meets a business person in a hotel bar and almost the first thing that person does is buy her the most expensive drink available. Not long after, the business person gets her a room in the hotel. A little later, Paula says that she watches porn movies all the time, adding It's fascinating to see how men view sex. These two statements are not linked by a because, but it might be implied. If it is, the suggestion is that Paula takes a professional interest in what turns men on. Paula takes money jobs because what she considers to be her real work, writing non-fiction short stories for small literary magazines, doesn't pay (I mean that literally). In the second-last scene, Julie lies on the bed, pretending to be asleep, and watches while Paula removes the money from her wallet. Clear now? Paula is, in effect, a part-time prostitute. Because women express issues of doubt and control differently, there's no point in her trying to use handcuffs and a whip on Julie. She has to exercise her imagination a bit more but she's prepared to do that, for a price.Watch Paula when Julie approaches her in the hotel bar. She's constantly sizing Julie up, trying to figure out whether she wants to do business and if so, how far she wants to go. That, I think, is the point of the exchange in the lift about the strap-on Julie is making it clear that she's looking for a good time.

Maybe it's boredom; maybe it's indigestion from eating too much popcorn. Who knows? Who cares? We who hand over our hard-earned cash to keep the wolves (or coyotes, perhaps) from its door should be grateful when this happens, because it results in the occasional small-scale acutely-observed unsettlingly intimate piece of cinematography which reminds us that, despite the monster's influence, there still exist in that land a handful of real human beings trying to make a living by making films about... real human beings trying to make a living.Look up! See that glass ceiling? No? well that's probably because you're a man. Or short-sighted. Workaholic Stockard Channing thinks she's got her nose pressed up against it. All that hard work, and for what? The Man At The Top wants to talk to her. Pronto. Why, he's even insisting on meeting in some God-forsaken half-built airport hotel in the middle of corporate nowhere. What is it that could not possibly wait until she gets back to the office? It's a recipe for a bad mood, so it's no surprise when she takes it out on her poor hapless assistant Julia Stiles.This neatly divides our sympathies. Channing's about to have her entire raison d'etre whipped away, and Stiles simply had the bad luck to be an unimportant traveller at the mercy of the weather and the airlines. Now they're both stuck in that hotel with no-one to take it out on except each other.Except that nothing is quite as it seems. It would be giving too much away to explain how, exactly (and indeed the film never quite makes the truth of the matter clear), but suffice to say that power and powerlessness don't always reside where they seem to. Anyway, this film isn't really about what these women get up to (or what happens to the unfortunate headhunter (sorry, executive recruitment consultant) that Channing has asked to find her a new job). No, it's about how they very quickly find out that they are, more or less, the same person 30(-ish) years apart. Strong women. Frustrated women. Independent women. Different perspectives, of course Channing's frustration stems from her perception of that glass ceiling, whereas Stiles' is because she hasn't found a way through life yet. Of course it's not a comfortable discovery (how many of us really want to see ourselves from the outside?) but in the end they grudgingly accept the truth about themselves and each other.All this is on the whole nicely observed and faultlessly acted. One moment in particular stands out for sheer economy of effect Stiles seems to be about to take her bra off when she pauses, pokes her tongue out and closes the door in our face, managing effectively to say Get lost! to Channing, us and the Hollywood machine in one split-second gesture. (Economy seems to have been a watch-word here - how many films have a cast of 10? And that includes the non-speaking parts.)It's a pity, though, that there are a few places where the theme of women in a man's world is handled a little clunkily. A line like Whisky? That's a man's drink is on the unsubtle side, as is the scene where the two women start to explore an unfinished hotel wing, passing a sign saying Danger no admittance. (Careful now - you haven't got metaphorical hard hats on your pretty little heads.) But these are minor blots on the landscape of an otherwise excellent film.9/10.

The dilemma of personal and work fighting for which one to come first and the way that pain can slowly bubble up to the top from self abuse and abuse of others. That is what you see in these characters. They may act extremely but they are shown in a very human way. Chaning has some really great acting in this role her emotions are so big they almost pull you into the room with them. while this may not be the best film both of them have done it is a very good piece and it is well put together.A true character piece not flashy or full of special effects but full of raw and gritty emotions.

When Paula arrives late to a meeting due to a delayed flight, a distressed Julie has her fired on the spot.  Later, after being promoted CEO of the company, Julie runs into Paula sitting alone in a bar, apologizes for her rash behavior and the two set out on a night of female bonding, power trips, revenge, mind games, and button pushing.This verbal film spends a considerable time exploring the stark contrasts between the two women.  Paula is a hostile young woman who writes non-fiction about her life experiences, sports tattoos, experiments with bisexuality and self-mutilation, and has a fondness for hardcore pornography.  Julie is career-driven to the point of isolation and is much softer and less confrontational than Paula.  It is exactly through these contrasts that we see a complementary relationship emerge between these two characters.  While Paula's brash confidence exposes Julie's insecurity and anxiety, Julie's worldliness and experience make Paula seem impetuous.  As a result, a dynamic interplay and synergy come out from these exchanges.When a male associate of Julie's enters the plot, Paula ups the ante by revealing to Julie that he committed a rape at a frat party she attended in Boston years ago.  From this point on, The Business of Strangers turns into a story of revenge and maintains a misanthropic and satirical tone.  It is this tone that makes The Business of Strangers so much like Neil Labute's indie hit, In the Company of Men, in the way that it explores power trips, mind games, one-upmanship, and competition.  In this film, a woman's struggle within a male-dominated corporate world is also an theme that is covered.The Business of Strangers is not exactly an impressive film stylistically, but it more than makes up for this in its delicious dialogue which works two ways.  It always keep the suspense going by teasing and daring the audience to guess what will happen next, only to foil any attempt to do so.  Another thing the dialogue does is establish the characters' personalities by shedding light on their life histories and motives.  Channing and Stiles fill both their roles to perfection and play off each other extremely well.  Channing is up to task with her most interesting role since Six Degrees of Separation nearly ten years ago.  Every look and gesture serves to imply the world-weariness and jaded vulnerability that Julie inhabits.  Stiles, is no less impressive as the more provocative of the two women.  Apart from seeing a few random scenes from 10 Things I Hate About You, I have never seen her act before, but her dynamic performance here has me intrigued.  Both Channing and Stiles are deserving of Oscar nominations, but will most likely be overlooked since The Business of Strangers is a low budget indie film.  While the 85-minute running time is slight, this movie will keep you engaged in thought as well as entertained.

The always-superb Stockard Channing is at her coiled best, never really seeming relaxed even when she's supposedly tanked on scotch. An Oscar-worthy performance, even when we're not completely sure of her motivations - although this is a good thing here, because SHE's not so sure about what the heck she's doing either, even though she's supposedly so in control. And Julia Stiles shines here too, investing her character of Paula with ambiguity galore - in the course of the film she exhibits confusion, rage, sadness, cruelty, disgust and much more -- sometimes all in the same scene. There are no simple explanations here, no easy and tidy ending to this tale (just like in life - 'the messiness of life,' Paula alludes to early in the film). Every day people act out neurotic behavior (which has nothing to do with their daily lives but rather with things that have happened in their pasts), and every day people who are supposedly in control desperately long for 'a dominatrix' to work them over for a few hours a week. Julie 'hires' Paula to do that for her in this movie, and by the end, after all the mind games have been played and the dust settles, you're not sure what to think, which is also the way life does us for the most part.

Well, maybe it's only me, but I thought the movie is too strange for its own good. Of course I liked some scenes, but the movies was boring overall and as I said couple of times already - strange. So we have a mature woman who fires a young beautiful girl, but after she realizers life is not that bad, she brings the girl back to her job when they meet in a hotel. In fact the movie continues in the hotel and ends there which I consider as another pointless act.The plot's direction leads us to another kind of movie, highly different than the first 15 minutes which are kinda promising if you don't have some big expectations. The movie is overrated according to IMDb's rating. It's even for 6.0. This is my opinion of course, but I am just saying this, cause your expectations might become higher if you see the rating and you might think the movie is special or something. As I said, it is different, but I didn't like that. I suppose, I should give some arguments why I don't like the movie that much or why I think it's strange. Well, there are some SPOILERS below. We have something like a friendship between a young beautiful girl with self confidence, eccentric character and optimistic look on her present and future life and a mature woman with strange understandings of life, dark past and pessimistic look on her future life. These 2 totally different girls meet and the movie becomes strange. First the director and writer as well, recreates a lesbian kind of story which was kinda strange addition to the plot and the idea of the movie. This is the main problem with the movie. I didn't get what does the creator of the movie, want to show with this relation between the two females. Then, when we think that these 2 girls are about to kiss or something, or if not, they would become best friends and they will trues each other although of them is under the control of the other when it comes to their job. Nope, that does not happen. When a guy arrives and meets Julie Stile's character, she tell her mature friend who knows the guy from a long time, that he had raped a friend of hers. Another strange plot twist that I didn't like. It was a really strange decision of the director. After these 2 strange plot directions, I realized the movie symbolizes something and it's full of deeper meanings that are not necessary at all.Other than the stuff above, I was surprised from the good acting, the nice themes and the good directing. These things made me give a good rating for the movie. I don't quite know why. I guess, I've been in good mood. I always look for a great plot in similar kind of movies. Anyway, I don't recommend it to anyone, although I can't say it's the worst movie ever. I guess it just lost its potential, trying to be a thriller like no other.

Stockard Channing is an anxious, stressed, and cynical professional who knows utter randomness is a fact of life. She does her job as well as she can, but realizes that most of her working future is way beyond her control. Fred Weller is an unnecessary acquaintance who happens to be there when the Julia Stiles character lands in their midst.Now, I must confess that being a male reviewing a work involving predominantly females may not seem proper because I am sure I missed many nuances, both verbal and nonverbal, that women would note and understand, however, that said, from my point of view, I could understand the power struggles and spur of the moment decisions that Channing was forced to confront. Maybe it is only in my imagination that women have the same conflicts and tensions as men, but the way this story was presented I am sure gender was not a determining factor motivating the actions of either the Channing or Stiles character.

So, how to prepare for this movie1) You must must must watch Neil LaBute's _In the Company of Men_ first. I suspect this film is a direct answer to that one.  Whereas LaBute's story was about misogyny and male cruelty, _The Business of Strangers_ tells a similar story from the sexual revenge plot of two women.  The beauty of this film is that, as you will see, it is not content to stop merely at the divisions of biological sex.2) An understanding of feminism and/or gender studies is helpful (or maybe even required) for this film.  At a very basic level, what we have here is a deconstruction of several widely-accepted cultural ideas about gender and rape.  By the end of the film, these concepts are marvelously ambiguous. Again, though, you need some background to appreciate it.Some may say that a film such as this which practically requires Cliffs Notes isn't worth watching.  I would respectfully disagree.  Although it's a shame that _The Business of Strangers_ can't be more self-contained, in 85 minutes it does reach a depth of social critique that simply cannot be matched by contemporary mainstream film.If you're willing to invest the time, you won't be disappointed.

Why would Julie, the hard-boiled, female CEO fall for a story told by someone she just met that day and who has already shown the CEO that she likes to manipulate other people?  It was obvious from their initial conversation in the hotel bar that Paula is a cynical, egocentric child who `likes the messiness of life.'  Julie neither asks Paula for any sort of evidence nor confronts Nick, the accused, about the story. Julie just believes the whole story from the get-go.  This would never happen in real life.  I could understand Julie being sympathetic to Paula, but would she stoop to participating in very criminal acts solely on the word of a person such as Paula?Perhaps my incredulity can be ascribed to a lack of sensitivity on my part - that today's women share a bond of sisterhood that a middle-aged man can never hope to understand.  But a middle-aged woman like Julie who came up the hard way (East Michigan Community College) would be more likely to ask for some hard evidence before taking action against a business acquaintance.Other than this turd in the punchbowl, The Business of Strangers is a well-crafted piece of cinema featuring very good direction by Patrick Stettner, excellent acting &#150; especially Stockard Channing &#150; and believable dialogue.

Stockard Channing plays a businesswoman, a hustler and seller and marketer of some kind, who's feeling her age and thinks she might be getting the ax. (Channing, in her late fifties, seems to be playing late-forties, maybe fifty.) Julia Stiles plays a privileged young temp whose pleasure is teasing and torturing Channing's Ms. Powerful with her youth, her superior desirability, her sexy carefreeness, and her air of giddy entitlement. The nubile dominatrix tortures the baby boomer with her own stretch marks and wrinkle cream. For intellectual male heterosexual audiences, this stuff is the equivalent of Howard Stern playing Lesbian Butt Bongos.Stettner rips off Neil LaBute's IN THE COMPANY OF MEN hook, line and sinker--only his version might be called In the Company of Tough, Butt-Kicking Women Who Just Might Be in the Mood for Their  First Taste of Spicy Tuna Roll. He even rips off LaBute's long, squinch-inducing monologue delivered in a sauna--only, in YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS it was Jason Patric describing an adolescent anal rape, and here it's Channing detailing the first flicker of menopause leaping up during a Packers game.(Channing seems to see her dark-horse Oscar nod in sight before you can say Go Cheeseheads!) The icky subtext of the movie is that of a hot, generation-y actress playing power games with a better, much older actress who spends most of her days on the Lifetime Channel--and if I wanted to be made that squeamish, I'd go read a Bruce Wagner novel. And Stettner's frigid, Kubrickian visuals (by way of LaBute), and clunky, stagy dramaturgy grate. Still and all, Channing, a beautiful, lyrical actress unsuited to this Mamet-with-breasts stuff, finds a tricky, filigreed, almost silly delicacy between the lines, and Stiles seems to have fun playing what we all secretly suspect she is a harsh, unplayful, control-freaky Jodie Foster-in-training, i.e., the lost twin sister of Claire Danes.

Angry executive (Channing) does a major put-down of the young tech person (Stiles) who was late for an important presentation (delayed flight) and leaves her standing at the hotel as her ride takes off, and the rest of the film is Stiles' character getting revenge.SPOILERS ahead - When they meet up again at the hotel, after Channing finds out she has just been promoted to CEO instead of being fired, she is contrite and buys the younger woman a drink. Their apparent bond gets closer and closer, until Stiles' character convinces the new CEO that the head-hunter friend once raped Stiles' best friend 4 years ago in Boston while he was in graduate school. He later comes to the hotel room, is lured to stay, drugged, placed in a part of the hotel under remodeling, and left, with rapist and other things written on him.

Channing's acting is extraordinary - her character is fascinating - and as we learn late in the movie, NOT as Stiles wrongly suspects, a pushover. I find intriguing the underlying idea for the movie. I hope the moviemaker makes many more. **** SPOILERS **** However, I had several problems with the movie. I. The immediately review by another middle aged man (like myself!) cited my first reaction to this movie - in almost exactly the same words I was to use. I found VERY hard to believe that Channing's character would find this utter brat (evident within moments of their departure from the conference room) someone to spend any time with. Sure, she's lonely; sure she wants to celebrate; sure she's getting drunk; she's far away from home; sure she feels guilty - but I still don't buy it. Stiles's character is truly deeply hateful, a cretin out to soak Channing's character with her desire for champagne from the first moment we see her in the bar. Stiles is completely and utterly obnoxious - a pig - and no one would want to be in her company more than necessary. II. Moreover, as the preceding reviewer stated, Channing's tough well-travelled character would never simply take on face value some story from a tattooed kid, speaking of a major felony committed by someone Channing had known a long time - without any evidence whatever. Presumably nothing this fellow had ever done had caused Channing to distrust him.Is it the moviemaker's withering criticism of feminism that it so distorts one's judgment that one swallows whole anything said by a drunk tattooed obnoxious stranger? III. It also seems extraordinary that Channing would be putty in this girl's hands - through much of the movie, every suggestion is met with total compliance. Why? I am single, middle aged, and have been on many business trips - it's unimaginable that I'd be knocking back drinks in my room on a business trip with some tattooed 23 year old stranger who had been late to the meeting that day -and was asking to borrow my bathing suit.IV. As another reviewer mentioned, why did Stiles do ANY of this? We are given no reason except that she is BAD. She wants to humiliate people - women as well as men - and that's that. Well, I suppose mystery is better than a too facile explanation - but it is still a bit strange that we are given no hint of why someone would act this horribly. V. Incidentally, some reviews are stating that the movie leaves it ambiguous whether there had been any rape by the recruiter. This is false. There is no doubt whatever that no rape occurred. Why else would the recruiter lie about never having been to Boston, never having gone to grad school there, etc.? Unfortunately for the movie, this is presented as a surprise -when in fact a viewer realizes this within a few minutes of it the rape allegation being made - certainly by the time the man is forced to watch pornographic videos.***SPOILERS END **** All that said, I found this movie interesting and the dialogue well-written. Stockard Channing was robbed in not being nominated - let alone not winning an Oscar over Julia Roberts as Erin Brockavich!

Was she as good as she seemed, or was she just playing the corporate field to better her advantage? The other question that came to mind was her coincidental neurosis dealing with the sporadic meeting with her boss. There was nothing, outside of moving the plot forward, which would have indicated these sudden laps of shame in her profession. The drop-in of Julia Styles suddenly meeting in the same business setting (having never met before), missing a plane together, and coincidentally ending up at the same bar sharing drinks and eventually inner secrets, just flabbergasted me. Why would these two ever meet up in a typical setting? While I don't want to think that this was just a film about the imagination of Channing, it did make you question and use the word why. Typically I like this mind-boggling element in films, but in Business of Strangers, it just didn't work. There was no tell in this film, and that tugged at me the wrong way in this film. The eerie patience that was demanded of the viewer left us with no moment of satisfaction. There was quite a bit of wait, but no payoff at the end. On one hand we have a very self-centered woman, career bent, but possibly not happy with her choices, and yet on the other we have a care-free young lady, experimental in nature, ready to change the world one person at a time. It seemed too forced, too stereotypical &#150; too manipulative. I needed more similarities; I needed more shock to really bring these two strangers together. This tried to be a darker rendition of The Odd Couple with drinking, rape, and random revenge. Force enough onto a character (or characters), the audience begins to believe that it is a Hollywood feature, and you meaning imperatively finds itself lost in the trenches.Acting. In Business of Strangers it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the greatest that I have seen of Stiles or Channing. Their chemistry was decent, but it didn't compare to that of those characters in Tape or Company of Men. This was obviously a stage film, meaning that it was a small play that had the unique opportunity to see the other side of a film camera. It was a boring premise, which is one reason I feel so fooled by this film, which was followed up by my second pet peeve of this film, it never tackled any real issues. Who were these two characters that we so dutifully were thrust into their lives? What makes them tick? What is their past? What is their future? Most importantly, at least with this film, what makes them connect? Unlike other films brought from the stage, Business of Strangers answers none of the above. Perhaps it is my male view on a very personal female film, but this was released to general audiences, so the appeal had to be broad. It was not emotional, it was not sad, nor was it victorious at the end. While I do not think rape is a minute problem in America, I do feel that I needed more with Channing and Stiles. Was she lying about the incident? Was she just trying to get Channing to release something from within? I wanted answers, I was pining inside for them, but the never arrived. Unlike Shape of Things, there was just something missing. It was as if a big chunk of the film was misplaced. Fred Weller did a decent job, but his motive was missing.Director Stettner did his job by bringing the characters together in, albeit, random events. He set the stage with surprisingly the darkest of corners and hidden hotel rooms. There was even a moment of unneeded tension in a scene (while I felt it wasn't needed) that was done with some bit of grace, but he continued to forget the element mentioned above &#133; motive. There was no reason to answer the question why, when our characters were taking unmotivated photographs, when they were about to commit murder, or when they were talking to each other like they had known each other for years. There was no reason for director Stettner to get us from point A to point B, so in my opinion, he moved the action along through a series for unconnected points. Sure, the acting was meaty, but the words that they spoke merely were attached to a script which eventually had to have and ending. For a little over and hour, I watched good actors read through a bad script. Again, if there was more creativity in the motion of Stettner's work, then maybe I would have felt better by the ending, but I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat, the characters didn't have me questioning the validity of my own life, nor was I ready to gush Niagara Falls over the body of work. By the end, I felt bland, as if I just watched a feminist remake of In the Company of Men or Tape.Overall, I wish I could say that I can suggest this film, but I cannot. The acting, with enough said above, you should realize that these are two great actors working through an abominable script. The story was pieced together probably overnight without much thought going into the entire process. It was dark, but the tones were miscommunicated as we tried to grapple with the idea that these two people had never met before but spoke as if they were best friends. Coupled with dialog that would make kindergarteners chuckle, Business of Strangers was a film packed with missed possibilities. If you are looking for either a redemption film or a film about coping with your tough job, may I suggest anything outside of this film.

On the other hand, it does show just what such people are like, and how the events depicted here are par for the course in that world.I disagree with a previous poster who said that Nick was the one character to come out of this story unscathed and with his innocence intact. Rather, his lack of a reaction to what they did to him demonstrates that this kind of thing is pretty much business as usual for him. He may have raped someone, and he isn't even shaken up about it.

Everything else in the project is acceptable. It has a sort of `People magazine' edge to it.But I think the basic material had a much greater potential which was avoided by a conspiracy of media mediocrity. This is a case, I think, where the writing of the writer/director is much much stronger than his direction.The screenplay is cleverly in two parts. The first establishes Channing's character as someone living in an exile of sorts -- someone who only gets limited information about the real world, about what is happening to her. She energetically fills in the details. Obviously she usually does so correctly because she is a senior executive. Her exile is in an abstract world of airports and hotels, no one place where reality can penetrate. This first part of the story shows us how she can fool herself into a false reality.The second part of the script repeats this. Again she is encountered with partial information and creates her own world, only this time the weakness is being exploited for the only reason that it can be.What's required here is that basic feel of exile, and the great effort one must expend to create one's own world which they carry with themselves. A lovely opportunity exists here, because that's what we all do, confabulate our world within the vacuum of our travels based on random messages from others. What's also required is the dramatic display of how difficult that is. Channing may be a veteran, but she sure misses the boat on this.What we could have had was the best elements of `The House of Yes,' and `Hurlyburly.'

There were so many issues that the film brings up but it never really explores these issues fully.  It's a pity because the performances from the two leads are so strong that I want to like the film.  And yet, I can't say that I would recommend this movie.If you want to see it, wait till it's out on video.

She doesn't disappoint, but this movie has an unbelievable plot device that is quite preposterous given the nature of the characters involved.  As it unfolded, I kept muttering, No way, they're not going to do this...', but yeah, they did.  There was potential for something really interesting here, but it devolved into something quite lame.

Stockard Channing plays Julie, a professional so devouted to her career she has neglect virtually every other aspect of her life.  She suspects she might be fired soon, and meets with an employment headhunter, Nick (Fred Weller).  Julia Stiles is Paula (at least that's the name she provides), Julie's young, impetuous, obviously unstable assistant.  After an acrimonious initial meeting, the two serendipidously meet in a hotel bar and become friends (Julie sees Paul as herself 20 years ago).  It turns out Julie has been promoted, not fired, and Julie and Paula decide to live it up in the bar.  During the party, Nick shows up (his flight was cancelled).  Later, Paula tells Julie she knew Nick in college, and he committed an atrocity against her best friend.  Later, when Nick shows up at Julie's room, the two women decide to get even.(WARNING  Some spoilers ahead).From the time Julie, Paula, and Nick meet at the bar the film is very predictable and staged.  It's obvious from the time her character is introduced that Paula is unstable and duplicitous (she's hostile to virtually everyone she encounters).  It's unreasonable to think a shrewd businesswoman like Julie wouldn't see through Paula's guise, and even more inconceivable she would risk her career to abet Paula in her malicious treatment of Nick (what they do is felonious).After Julie and Paul part ways (neither one too worse for wear), Julie reconsiders her life decisions and seems to re-evaluate her priorities.  This gesture by Stettner, while earnest, isn't the epiphany he seems to think it is, and in fact it's obvious from early on that Julie will realize this.  The Business of Strangers is one of those films that seems tailored for critics, with little appeal for anyone else  Yes, the acting is first rate and the deliberately antiseptic direction is an effective, somber indictment of the modern business world.  But, anyone who has seen more than a few films knows exactly where this one is headed after the first 30 minutes.  Ultimately, The Business of Strangers is just an exercise for Channing, Stiles, and director Stettner.

This may have been true in 1975, but it's not so true today.Furthermore, if Stockard Channing's character has reached a pinnacle of her career to become a CEO, it's absolutely unbelievable that she would behave in the way that writer/director Stettner presents her.In a Los Angeles times review of this film, it's pointed out that Stettner learned about the business world through working as an office temp. Clearly, that didn't give him enough insight into how real businesspeople behave. He obviously relies on outdated information about women in business, and it's clear he hadn't spent much time with real software company CEOs -- but I guess the office temps wouldn't do that, would they?Performances are good, and the technical aspects of the film are good. But as a story, it completely lacks credibility. Hard to believe this thing even found distribution...

Not much to say, because not much happens; the whole film could have been 15 minutes of a better movie. Some of the dialogue between the two women leads is the worst case of 'hey look, it's an actor reading from a sheet' i can remember seeing since drama classes in school (owch). As always in these situations it's hard to say how much is the script's fault - but either way the audience is getting the short end. The actors (i use the term for both sexes - geddit, it's a film about... n/m) look awkward, like they didn't know where to stand - weak direction maybe? Either way, this was even more unsatisfying (and unrealistic of course) to me than 'In the Company of Men'. Perhaps gender issues just bore me, so i wasn't the target audience... still, beware!If i can refer to other users' comments - i'm baffled by the references to great acting and great script.. i watched the film before reading any reviews, and noticed serious problems in the acting and in the script, repetition of cliche phrases (referring to drink as poison, 'f**k off' etc.)Stiles is quite good at crying though. Yeah, it should have been a play, which would also have had the bonus that i wouldn't have seen it p "},{"Title":"More Critically Acclaimed Garbage","Date":"12 August 2002","Score":"1 out of 5 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Thriller","Review":"  Two women at different rungs on the corporate ladder meet on a business trip and then proceed to bore you to death.This movie is supposed to be a study in control.  Julia Stiles (the ivy-league brat and aspiring writer forced to work an IT job in order to pay the bills) manipulates Stockard Channing (the community college grad and devoted career woman recently promoted to CEO of her company) into taking part in what we are supposed to believe is some revenge scheme against a man who sexually assaulted Stiles' friend.Except that through the course of this tedious film, we discover that it was really Stiles who was assaulted...no, wait actually, it turns out that Stiles doesn't even know this guy.How ironic.  How curious that after the whole ordeal (which eventually turns criminal), Stockard Channing seems amused that she has been so cleverly manipulated.  How totally ingenious.Except that we never really get to know Stiles' character.  We do get some insight into Channing's fiercely-determined, staggeringly-insecure CEO, but none into the enigmatic malcontent who is the movie's protagonist.Sure, not everything in life can be neatly tied up in two hours, but not everything in life deserves to be put on cellulose either.  This was just a bad film.At some point I will learn to decode the critics' reviews in order to identify these stinkers before I watch them. This particular offering was, according to one IMDB reviewer, filmed in just 23 days.  Maybe they should have taken a little longer. More than a study in control, this movie is a study in what people will swallow as art.I give it a 2, because Stockard Channing does a reasonable job with her role.

In a review I read of this movie, Stiles' character was described as a fragile wall flower who shows her true colors towards the end of the movie. This could not be farther from the truth. Even in the beginning scenes one can get the feeling of utter angst, and self-loathing steaming off Paula. To when you see her waiting in the bar, and a man comes to talk to her, with Paula telling him to f*ck off. Real fragile there, right? Her character completely gives off the airs of a 20-something nobody stemming from a rich family who has nothing to do but mess with peoples lives, and act vindictively. This by far overshadowed what could have been an amazing performance by Channing. The story itself was utterly vague, a tactic used by many independent film makers in order to supposedly let the viewer decide for themselves what is really going on behind the scenes. In the end it came out being just so vague that I had all together absolutely no clue as to the intents of the other. I think the whole black mail thing towards the end could have been more developed, whereas instead it came out as an empty threat. In the end I only found myself laughing at Paula's feeble attempts at seeming tough, and hardened by the world, as well as the men in it. To me, this film was just another one that the critics eat up because of its supposed artistry while holding no form, or poise at all.

Clever editing keeps us in the dark, too, and her promotion is at first easily mistaken for a lover's rupture. The pleasure of her good fortune is soured when we realise that she has no lover, just a job.The quality of the plot plummets inexplicably with the arrival of Julia Stiles' character, and the quality of the acting plummets just as violently with the arrival of Julia Stiles. It's not entirely her fault she gets nothing but ridiculous lines. The story that ensues is a betrayal of the movie's first quarter-hour there is no real story to speak of, just a series of picaresque moments, and the gentle but invasive probing of character that was promised is dismissed in favour of a meaningless attack on someone's life. Murder, especially of the wanton variety, is the thing Hollywood uses to give a film a sense of intellectual depth when it has none; ironically, it is fast becoming the thing independents use when they are scared of being thought dull and overly-intellectual. Sadly, it didn't improve this film.

It was far from perfection.  This film seemed like it would be better suited as a short film on late night cable.  It was not worth the four dollars I paid to rent it and I am glad I did not pay eight dollars to see it at the theater.The only positive things I can say about this film is that it has occasional humor, such as the humorous dialogue between Julia Stiles and Stockard Channing in the elevator, as they are surrounded by a bunch of men. Another humorous element is how the director tries to make Stockard Channing appear sexy, especially next to the young, attractive Julia Stiles, but Channing isn't sexy at all.As for the negative elements, the music tries to be the musical score from American Beauty but fails miserably.  The story is pretty flat and very predictable.  It ends quite quickly as well, which is a relief, but at the same time, leaves many things unanswered.While I am a big fan of independent films, The Business of Strangers is one to be avoided.  It seems like very little work went into it and very little came out of it.One out of five stars!
