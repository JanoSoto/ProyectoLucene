Stephen King is credited as one of the writers, and this is surprising to see as it is unclear if he has actually contributed to the script or this film was inspired from King's initial novel. The acting is quite mediocre, but the special effects are of record tackiness, with human puppets of the amazing quality of voodoo dolls. The gore factor is satisfying, even unexpectedly high. The reference to environmental issues as a contemporary premise to any evil we see on screen is flimsy and ephemeral. Overall, spare a few bucks to rent this on a Saturday night in with your friends and pizza.

The infamous ending of the third part of the Children of the Corn series feels like a disaster of epic proportions that kills what otherwise could be a near perfect movie. Nevertheless, this movie has many good things that are worth a watch.The plot is a very good twist to the well-known saga of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. After the horrifying events in Gatlin, two brothers, Eli(Daniel Cerny) & Joshua(Ron Melendez) are sent to a foster house in Chicago. Their new family is very eager to have children and gives them a warm welcome, but Eli & Joshua feel the cultural shock as they try to get used to the urban environment. While Joshua tries to fit in, the younger Eli begins to plant corn in order to bring the cult of He Who Walks Behind the Rows to the world.It is indeed a very good script, and for the most part it works. It is a huge improvement over the past sequels and in my humble opinion, sometimes it even surpasses the original. Daniel Cerny's performance is outstanding and one wonders why he suddenly stopped working when he was one of the very few child actors who could give a believable performance.The eerie atmosphere is back and there are great moments of suspense and surrealistic imagery. This is what Children of the Corn movies should be. The direction is pretty good, and it handles the script with perfection and lets it flow with good rhythm.If all these is so good, what can be so bad that makes the movie fail in the end? Without giving spoilers, let me just say that even when the SFX are top-notch for a low-budget movie; the ending pretends to be of epic proportions and ends up being one of the biggest SFX disasters ever.Don't get me wrong, even with it's HUGE SFX faults, it still is better than average, but it breaks everything that was build up to that moment, the eerie atmosphere fill with suspense turns into a savage gore fest in the style of Evil Dead but without the talent. It just feels like a different movie.Overall, it's worth a rent, especially for Daniel Cerny's performance who truly saves the film(no surprise that it's when he is gone that the movie falls down).

The older of the two fits in relatively well, but the younger has plans of his own. Planting a corn field in the abandoned property next door, he creeps out his adoptive parents and eventually converts the entire teenage population to his maze worshipping cult.Despite a predictable plot that seems to be missing chunks (at what point did Eli win over his peers?), dodgy special effects and wooden performances by its relatively unknown cast, the film is moderately enjoyable for what it is. If you want to see some brutal and over-the-top death scenes committed by vegetation, then Children of the Corn III hardly disappoints. Elsewhere, however, the film comes up short, and that's all there really is to it.The film was dumped in theaters briefly in 1994 before being thrust into complete oblivion, making room for four direct-to-video sequels and a made-for-TV remake.

Well he doesn't exactly say that &#x96; but his eyes told me that's what he was feeling.So apparently Eli is all evil and I think the movie was trying to push across that he was the devil? They really need to stop coming up with convoluted and over-reaching explanations when crazy religious kids who worship some corn demon works just fine.My favourite death was of the foster mother, who tripped over a pole and impaled her skull with a piece of pipe.

So it's no surprise that 'Children of the Corn IIIUrban Harvest' is no where near the quality of the original movie, in terms of production or plot.However, it is better than 'Children of the Corn II The Final Sacrifice'.The plot is simple two young boys from Gatlin, Nebraska, wind up adopted by a naive, well meaning couple in Chicago. Once there, the youngest, Eli, begins to resurrect the bloody, sacrificial cult of 'He Who Walks Behind the Rows...' The acting in this movie is almost as good as that in the original. Young Daniel Cerny in particular pulls of a masterstroke in portraying both the evil and the innocence of the manipulative Eli.The slow building of tension and suspense mirrors the nerve wracking atmosphere of the original movie, while the ignorance and naivety of the parents, creates a cruel feeling of vulnerability within the viewer.This movie does, however, have two main faults. Firstly, the plot, whilst simple and effective, is somewhat stretched-the bloody cult of a corn god in Chicago? Secondly, the ending is somewhat silly and fantastical, leaving the viewer either laughing or lamenting.My advice to fans of the genre and the original, is to watch this movie. It's not that bad, and for the most part is outright enjoyable. But be under no illusion-those who loathe the cliché's that sometimes creep into horror movies, should probably avoid this movie, and see the original instead.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.

Overall, if there is anyone out there who has not seen this movie, you should go rent it, you wont be let down, it's a great horror flick.

The results are completely predictable. While Joshua, the older one, is the more innocent of the two (he's not *from* Gatlin, but moved there (!) with his father after the evil kids took over), the maniacal child preacher Eli takes control of the formerly apathetic student body at their school, and arranges for various adults to meet grisly ends. Naturally, it's up to Joshua to save the day.The first movie in this unlikely series sure wasn't any good to begin with, and this is no better. In fact, it's pretty laughable, but it's also pretty entertaining as far as *this* kind of genre entertainment goes. A bunch of serious looking actors gamely go with the flow as things get nutty and gory. Screaming Mad George supplies the decent makeup effects, although when he attempts to actually visualize He Who Walks Behind the Rows in the form of a cheesy monster, the movie *really* goes downhill quickly. Refreshingly, there are not too many characters here that are worth anybodys' sympathies. William, for example, proves to be sleazy and ambitious when he realizes that Eli is contriving a simply beautiful strain of corn in an unlikely environment.What makes this entry in the series worth watching is young Cerny. He won't make you forget John Franklin (Isaac in the first movie) anytime soon, but he's quite effective in the role of this evil kid. There are supporting roles and cameos for the likes of Johnny Legend, Yvette Freeman ('E.R.'), and Michael Ensign (Ghost Busters, Titanic '97), as well as a super sexy leading lady in the form of Mari Morrow (How to Be a Player, 'Family Matters').If you want fun horror that doesn't have to be *quality* horror, then this one might fit the bill.Seven out of 10.

This time Eli is starting a new life in the suburbs of Chicago. It doesn't take long before he starts growing his own cornfield in an old closed down factory next to his home, and then it don't take long before he gets a little group of corn cult worshiping children again. There also this sub-plot with his new father who is amazed by Eli's astonishing new corn and are trying to get rich out of it.

In fact, it's pretty hard to make a Children of the Corn film which doesn't revolve around a bunch of 'corn-worshiping' kids killing adults in a field.Here, however, they try to breathe new life into the franchise by changing the setting to Chicago! Gone are the cornfields of small-town America, replaced by - er - cornfields in the middle of a major US city. Yes, two orphans from the original films are relocated to foster parents in Chicago and start planting corn in the back alleys in order to bring the cult of 'he who walks behind the rows' to the masses.It could be terrible. It nearly is. First of all the film is (semi) saved by the lead youngster, who, in my opinion, is the best actor to take on the part of a demonically-possessed psychopath with supernatural powers the series has produced yet. It's kind of worth watching for him alone.The other (again, I use the word 'semi') standout point is the ending. It's weird. Seriously, if you're watching this film and you hate it - fair enough - skip to chapter 15 (I think that's the one before the last) and just watch it from there. It gets totally weird. It's like they've tacked on the ending from another horror movie. If nothing else, I'll bet it gets a laugh out of you! In short Children of the Corn (1) was the best and most original. Part 2 was so bad it was laughably brilliant (and my favourite simply because it was so dumb). Part 3 does its best to be different. It succeeds in some places and fails miserably in others. Know that you're never going to get an Oscar-worthy epic with this one.

After murdering his father in some rural town, Eli and his brother Joshuah are put in to foster care to live with Mr and Mrs. Potter in Chicago. It isn't long before Eli starts praying to he who walks behind the rows and planting corn seeds in an empty factory next to the Potter's house. We quickly find out that Eli and Joshuah aren't actually related. Eli was adopted by Joshuah's parents and was one of the original children from Gatlin (therefore he hasn't aged since 1964). Anyone that gets in Eli's way or finds out his secret gets knocked off in grotesque ways, leading to a fiery ending in which Joshuah realizes that his brother must be stopped.I like seeing the two Amish-like brothers interact with the city kids, it was interesting dynamic. This sequel in the franchise definitely gets points for trying something new and taking the story outside of the cornfields in either Gatlin or Hemingford. The problem with it taking place in Chicago is that it doesn't have that same feel as the previous installments did. The special effects are also pretty good once again. Instead of so much blood like in Children of the Corn II, it is more and creative and disgusting in this one. The acting from everyone involved was really good, especially from Daniel Cerny who played evil Eli. This film does have it's flaws. It is VERY slow moving at times and becomes tedious during the middle frame. I also hate that they didn't continue with the story from the previous films. Yes, Eli was from Gatlin years ago but that's it. At least Part II continued off from where the first one finished. Overall a decent film which fans of the franchise should enjoy.

All of the actors were excellent and you could really feel for them. People think the change of scenery ruined things, but I thought it was interesting and refreshing. All of the deaths were dreadful, and the victims were innocent, unlike most characters in horror films. Then, came the last ten minutes or so. I think the creators wanted to pay homage to 50's and 60's horror films, but the attempt was futile. Too bad it couldn't have ended with an intense struggle between Eli and Josh. After all, the followers were once gang members, and they could've attacked Josh more. Josh fighting off T-Loc and stabbing him with his own switchblade would've been great. Eli being stabbed once without his bible in front of him. Maybe even have one of his arm's whacked off. He could just regenerate like the corn and be good as new.

First off, this one has a wicked sense of humor and done more in the intentionally campy style of Creepshow than the first two were, complete with a cartoon sickle playfully cutting through the opening and closing credits. Story concerns two Gatlin boys, orphaned of course, adopted by an urban family and one plots to spread his special brand of corn goodness to his denizens. Religious symbolism pretty much makes the rules (along with the myth established in part 1) and tells this story. It is very interesting to note the racial dichotomy between Eli (the kid on the cover) and his urban rival. Was it coincidence that he was named Malcom? Regardless, the urban/black and white/rural contrasts add historical and political connotations to the already religious and parricidal connotations of the original King story and adds a dark satirical side to the film on top of the camp/horror (which is far more interesting and original than the tired and overused Native American legend connection from part 2). This is also the only CotC flick (that I know of) that gives us a look at the infamous He Who Walks Behind The Rows. Fans of puppetry will find this a treat esp. in this age of CGI-fests. Other cheap, early CGI effects are not only surprisingly pretty good looking, but creative and creepy and with a special EC-like satirical touch. The ending not only makes the aforementioned connotations much broader, but takes the satire to a relevancy that stands perhaps even stronger today. All-in-all I'd say this is a pretty good Creepshow style horror flick with some good stereotype humor that had the potential to, but doesn't reach Creepshow or EC Comics level in quality, but tried.

But He who walks behind the rows is determined not to let that happen. As a new sect of evil children under Eli's command, attempt to rid themselves of the adults & Eli's specially grown corn is also set to be sold worldwide, which will result in the death of millions of people. CHILDREN OF THE CORN III URBAN HARVEST is a highly enjoyable sequel to the CHILDREN OF THE CORN franchise, it's obvious CHILDREN OF THE CORN II THE FINAL SACRIFICE must have turned quiet a profit on home video, otherwise DIMENSION FILMS (it's distributor) wouldn't have invested their money in another sequel. CHILDREN OF THE CORN III URBAN HARVEST disproves the last films subtitle THE FINAL SACRIFICE the Native American professor RED BEAR'S comments at the end of that film, that the evil was now over & also ignores what looks to be He who walks behind the rows end of terror at the end of that movie. Since He who walks behind the rows is very much alive here. What I liked so much about the film, is it's interesting & engaging story, which is full of interesting plot twists & turns & add more elements to the plot by constantly building on the story of the first two. One interesting element is the step dad's (a commodities broker) dealing with a conspiracy with his co-workers, over selling the deadly corn Eli has planted & a satanic bible that holds the key to the evil Eli's powers, has also been added to the mix. JAMES D.R. HICOX (Who's brother ANTHONY HICKOX serves as an Executive Producer) does fairly well behind the camera, delivering a nice professional look & knows how to milk the moments of suspense & tension for maximum impact. The films gore effects are also pretty terrific & disgusting, all courtesy of special effects wizard SCREAMING MAD GEORGE. All that aside, I did have some confusion over the films plot, since it never does explain why if Eli, (who during a priests nightmarish flashback of the events of the first two films, is seen assisting the children in the slaughter of the adults) is so evil & a demon of great power, why He who walks behind the rows didn't use him to lead the children in the first two films, instead of mere mortals like Isaac, Malachi & Micah? (it's revealed also through newspaper clippings that Eli has from 1964 & 1973 etc. also committed other horrible crimes & never ages) The film also has some humorous moments on hand, such as when a teacher is telling the student some of them is going to pass, except one kid (who is sleeping in class) whom he says will never pass & goes on a rant while writing on the chalkboard as to why. Another thing worth noting, is how many of those who worked on HELLRAISER III & CHILDREN OF THE CORN PART II also returned behind the camera for this one & the sequel ends on an intriguing note, that actually sets the stage for a possible sequel & although several sequels followed, it was never followed up on, or mentioned in any of the sequels. All in all, CHILDREN OF THE CORN III URBAN HARVEST is a really interesting & fun horror film for horror fans, full of great special effects work & a very interesting plot, to help it rise above many horror films of it's kind & the film is arguably better than many of the Corn's outings (especially any of the sequels that followed after 5). Highly recommended to horror fans, but if you didn't like the first two, then don't bother with this one. But question, am I the only one that thinks the score is to reminiscent to THE OMEN?

There are some truly captivating death scenes. For example (SMALL SPOILERS), a lady trips and falls backwards. The back of her head is impaled by a water pipe. Mouth wide open, water--then blood--spurts out of her mouth like a fountain! In another scene, corn stalks wrap around a young man's head. You witness as his head is slowly torn off of his shoulders. Very eerily, the head continues to scream and twitch as the stalks continue to stretch his spine to the limit. By the end of the scene, you are left with a broad view of the corn field, with the boy's high head at the center of attention (END OF SPOILERS). The horror scenes are very entertaining and take up a very large portion of the movie. The lame plot can be overlooked in this great excuse for insane violence.

Then last but not least was the finale, it should've ended a lot of earlier. But instead they had to get a few more deaths in before the credits started to roll.

Children of the Corn III - Urban Nightmare or Child of the Yawn - Urban Garbage.The film seems to start off fair enough and holds some mystery from the previous two as to how the story will develop, and develop it does, from a story with some potential into a sort of Omen style horror with a big obvious ending. Dan Cerny as Eli plays the main character quite well and is good at the sinister look but can't hold the scenes for very long and is too young for the part. The story is very weak and has no character actors just a good deal of extras and cheap amateurs added in for the low budget vs maximum effect death scenes and special effects ending.Another Hollywood production team has decided to cash in on a sequel 'ok, this'll make us one or two gold bars of latinum, oh and er...how can we turn it into a Hollywood blockbuster? I know let's take two brothers from the original town and put them in a modern day urban environment except...wait for it, one of them is evil and one of them is good', now if that Kane & Able premise doesn't get your blood flowing and scare you half to death the special effects at the end are sure to give you a good old gut busting laugh. What the hell is happening at the end? I think the biggest joke (if not the blatantly obvious part in an early scene where the stone wall shakes, do these people watch the film after making it?) has to be where the model picks up Joshua's girlfriend, it looks like a kid's alien toy reaching out for a Barbie doll. It seems originality is traded for money more and more often in the film industry and is such in this case, it doesn't follow the original story as the Children are the good bad guys seeking justice on corrupt adults who don't practise what they preach, in Urban Knightmare they are the bad guys, for what reason? Who knows, maybe Dode Levinson can spare some time from writing top quality screenplays and shed some light on that.If you decide to watch this film, or it's on Sky and you're bored ) do yourself a favour and stick with it through to the poor special effects, then hold out for the ending and you'll probably think, how predictable, what a waste of time.Summary Lame and pointless storyline, sacrilege to the original book, if someone ever buys me this on DVD I'm going to give it to my pet dog to chew up as a play toy.

Although you couldn't accuse it of being a bona fide good film, it is constantly entertaining, tighter paced and gorier than its predecessors. Director James Hickox seems to have the same skill at making mindless yet enjoyable and worthwhile b horror pictures as his brother Anthony and this is a fine example. The acting is middling, mostly fair to unconvincing especially the teenage members of the cast. Daniel Cerny does well as the creepy kid, though it seems to me unlikely that a little freaky white kid would have so much success bringing God to the ghetto, especially his brand of one who walks behind the rows craziness. Still, the adult slaying fever hits the big city, as does a fair amount of supernatural jiggery pokery, ultimately leading to a big climax of endearingly cheap proportions. I liked this one for all its cheesiness, its watchable and has some good gore, from Screaming Mad George I believe. Recommended for its energy, and its frequent dumb but gnarly moments, and the fact that its a real tangible step up in all ways from the first two.

Only at spot 97, true, but still chosen by many voters on this website as one of the hundred WORST movies out there in movie-land. Well okay, it's unquestionably a bad film, but it's very well endurable and actually pretty fun in case you're just looking for some extreme gore and laughable dialogs. Personally, I had no problems with any of the previous COTC-films, but it's an overall forgettable franchise with a silly premise and only the occasional atmospheric moment. This third installment in the series especially suffers from a total lack of originality. The rural Nebraska setting is exchanged for the big Chicago, but everything else is the same with an evil little kid nagging about Some Guy Who Walks Behind The Rows and brutally killing all the adults that come too close to his precious corn. Siblings Josh (long and dumb) and Eli (short and malicious) move in with their new family and while Josh is trying to fit in with the gangsta-school kids, Eli grows corn in the backyard and brainwashes everyone under the age of 19 to worship the crops. Don't expect a coherent storyline or breathtaking suspense, but there sure are the several sick killings of innocent people to 'enjoy'. There are very few sympathetic characters in this film and yet they die in the most horribly imaginative ways! The most amiable person in the cast has a nasty water pipe accident, whilst another poor soul has her face burnt away. Typical harvesting tools like shovels and scythes are working overtime, too! The climax is completely over-the-top in the gore department, as literally dozens of teenagers are devoured by a Tremors-like worm monster. Most of the make-up effects are pretty decent, except when the giant corn-worm is too obviously eating little puppets instead of real teens. Hickox' directing is rather weak, but it was his first achievement. Then again, he made Blood Surf and Sabretooth half a decade later, and those suck as well. Daniel Cerny is effectively creepy sometimes, though he preaches too much and his passion for corn is perhaps the most disturbing element about the whole movie. Freaking weirdo!

With their Father suddenly disappearing Joshua & Eli are sent to the big city of Chicago & placed with foster parents William (Jim Metzler) & his wife Amanda Porter (Nancy Grahn). While Joshua seems like a nice lad Eli is a bit of a freak, he won't change his old fashioned clothes, his suitcase is full of corn & at school he begins to brainwash his fellow pupils into joining his religious cult who worship 'he he walks behind the rows', as there aren't many corn fields in Chicago Eli grows one in an abandoned factory near his home. However Eli isn't growing any old corn, no he is growing super strong corn & super tasty corn but this corn comes at a price as once you eat it your body magically fills with cockroaches who then exit through your mouth. Eli convinces William to use his contacts at work & sell the corn worldwide & thus commencing his evil plan for world destruction!Directed by James D.R. Hickox this is the third entry in the Children of the Corn series of films that now numbers seven including this, out of those seven films I have personally seen the first three & I thought Children of the Corn III was inferior to the previous two instalments. The script by Dode B. Levenson is based on the story by Stephen King but I would imagine in name only. In my opinion the big mistake it makes is transferring the basic plot of the first two films & sticking it in a modern urban setting, in the small community of Gatlin the premise worked, was effective & plausible in context. However shifting the action to Chicago things seem out of place, I can't for the life of me see a freaky kid like Eli being able to convince what seems like the entire high school into joining him & his cult, I mean these are guys with serious attitudes who would hit you as soon as look at you or pull a butterfly knife out on you if you even looked at them in the wrong way. I found it all rather difficult to swallow & then there's magical corn this time that kills you if you eat it, fireball fights, killings, there's even more confused religious nonsense & a book that seems nothing more than a convenient way to end the film. It's a bit of a mess although having said that it's fairly watchable if you like the horror genre, it moves along at a fair pace, is never too boring & it has a few nice deaths especially towards the end when it picks up for a action & special effect packed climax.Director Hickox does an OK job, there's a few decent scenes here & some gore, various corn related deaths occur as the corn leaves come to life & rip people's heads off, poke their eyes out & generally mistreat them, someone falls over & is impaled on a pipe, various people spew up cockroaches, someone has their face burnt off & there's a massacre at the end with some gory deaths by scythe & more corn leaves.Technically Children of the Corn III is pretty sound, it's competent & generally well made except for the variable special effects & in particular the absolutely awful looking monster at the end which is one of the worst I've seen in a long time & brings back memories of terrible rubber monsters from the 50's & 60's as this one really doesn't look any better. Some of the optical effects are also best described as poor. The acting isn't up to much to be honest, apparently this was Hollywood superstar Charlize Theron's first film appearance in an uncredited role which must have been small, I don't think she boasts about it.Children of the Corn III didn't really work for me, it's watchable, has some decent horror scenes but at the end of the day placing the action in Chicago was a mistake. At the time of my writing this comment Children of the Corn III is languishing on the IMDb's bottom 100 films list, while those who have a fondness for horror may like it & tolerate it's shortcomings other's should note it's on that list for a reason.

This third film in the series was the first to go straight to video but it looks like it might have originally been meant for theaters.

The movie is certainly better than the first one but I'm not sure how many people, outside of die-hard horror nuts like myself would actually want to watch it. I think the best thing they did was move the action to Chicago and put the cornfield in an abandoned building.

The screenplay has a rather nice story even if what the heck Eli's trying to do never really makes too much sense.

Why even turn such a bad script into a movie. Well, bad is perhaps not the best word for it but it's just so incredibly standard and there is nothing, spectacular, shocking or memorable ever happening in this movie.None of the Children of the Corn movies are exactly known as brilliants ones and it's not that hard to see why. The movies have a pretty simple concept, that builds and rely on its children characters. Children are however not within the best age group, acting-wise and on top of that, they just aren't very convincing as being scary. It's also a pretty tiresome concept. There is very little to exploit with but yet they managed to make 7 movies so far, focusing on the corn worshiping children, who want to see all adults death.The Eli Porter is just very annoying instead of scary really. What a little brat, even though the actor that played him was already 14 at the time. His acting and just the character in general annoyed me. But can you blame the actor for this really? It was after all the story that gave him too much to do.And is this movie even an horror? It isn't until the end that monsters and other supernatural elements start to kick in. For the other most part the movie just consists out of flashbacks with footage from the previous movie of it in it as well. My 'favorite' thing about this movie its horror are its sound effects. There is a scene in the beginning in which they are just driving around in a car but you constantly hear this horror sound effects, like whispering and such, put under it that makes the sequence seem as if they are in a scary place or right in the middle of a nightmare, though absolutely nothing is happening.And no, overall there is far too little interesting happening in the movie. It was also a pretty odd choice to set this movie in an urban town instead of in the secluded, rural fictional town of Gatlin. I'm still waiting for the Children of the Corn In Space movie. It will probably add just as much to the series as this movie did.The foremost reason why this movie is not a very good one is not because its a bad movie but because its such a standard one, without really any good or interesting ideas of its own.5/10http//bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ "}]
