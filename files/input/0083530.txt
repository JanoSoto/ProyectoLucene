I'm not saying they're not funny, but in a run of jokes, it's not necessary.

And Rip Torn makes a miniscule appearance. How could we forget Stephen Stucket, the delightfully quirky Jacobs (Johnny in the first) who can lighten up any dank situation.So, it's still funny (even if it reuses jokes), it's got Sonny Bono, and it's got Raymond Burr on the other side of the courtroom in a flashback.My rating 8/10Rated PG for nudity, language, and comic violence.

This wild spoof of '70's disaster movies did not, as some believe, kill the genre ( it had burned itself out well before then ), but certainly made a fitting headstone.Interviewed at the time, Jim Abrahams said a sequel was in the offing, to be provisionally entitled 'The 747 Strikes Back'. But when it finally appeared two years later, it was called 'Airplane 2 The Sequel' and neither Abrahams nor Jerry and David Zucker had anything to do with it. Ken Finkleman, writer of 'Grease 2', served in the dual capacity of writer and director. He retained most of the original's characters ( except for Leslie Nielsen's 'Dr.Rumack' ).After the events of the original film, Ted Stryker ( Robert Hays ) became a moon pilot, but got incarcerated in a lunatic asylum ( named after Ronald Reagan ) following a major screw-up, while the love of his life, the beautiful Elaine ( Julie Hagerty ) is stewardess aboard the maiden commercial space shuttle flight to the Moon. A faulty computer sends the craft hurtling towards the Sun. Luckily a passenger ( Sonny Bono ) had the foresight to bring along a bomb in a briefcase. But who can bring the craft down? Guess who?The problem is that 'Airplane!' did not need a sequel. The original's freshness was bound to be lost - and was. I would imagine that the people who found this really funny in 1982 were those who never saw the first. Many gags are recycled; the hysterical woman being slapped by a long line of people, the 'what is it?' exchanges, MacCroskey ( Lloyd Bridges ) leaning on his desk and mimicking the pose on the picture behind him, someone throwing away a cigarette and causing an explosion etc.Some gags are lame - when someone says 'this panel is so hot you could fry eggs on it', we next see just that!But there are absolute corkers; the poster on the in-flight movie is 'Rocky 38' starring an elderly Sly Stallone in boxing gloves, a topical gag has E.T. trying to phone home and getting trouble from the operator, an elevator plays 'MacArthur Park' incredibly loudly, Stryker escapes from the asylum, and a searchlight picks out Jack Jones singing the theme from 'The Love Boat', a dog-owning family is told that 'Scraps' must have his shots, and then the customs officer pulls out a gun and shoots the animal, and a boy plays with a computer navigation system thinking it to be a game and almost kills a plane's passengers.William Shatner hams it up wonderfully as the Commander of 'Moonbase Alpha Beta' ( a reference to 'Space 1999' ), and the presence of Peter Graves ( once more 'Captain Oveur' ) allows for a dig at 'Mission Impossible'.Despite the over-familiarity of the material, 'Airplane 2' manages to outclass dismal recent attempts at spoof movies, most notably the 'Scary Movie' series.Funniest moment - MacCroskey shouts Stryker's surname and a man, misunderstanding him, punches out a woman. I do not endorse brutality towards women but it creases me up each time! 'Airplane 3', touted at the time, went unmade. "},{"Title":"Made for a quick buck.

What he delivered was the same motion picture, with most of the original gags, though now the focus was on spoofing the Space Shuttle and science fiction movies. What kills Airplane II is the bad comic timing, the feeling of deja vu (most of the orginal cast reprise their old roles,) and the self-conscious chintziness. A good example of the latter is the footage used in Stryker's flashback of the experimental space shuttle crash; it's the same Boeing 747 crash test footage used as a joke in-flight movie in Airplane! An even better example is the film's use of the Battlestar Galactica theme. It's like they built this film with off the shelf parts!

The story involves most of the original crew from the first movie on-board a lunar spaceship that is headed for the moon. A computer malfunction forces the ship off course. Once again, Ted Striker (Robert Hayes) and Elaine Dickensen (Julie Hagerty) are appointed to land the craft.A lot of Airplane II's jokes are taken from the first movie. The humor is predictable. Airplane II however is mostly strained because there is nothing original to the film. The Zucker brothers who did so well with the spontaneous humor and wit of the first film, by humorous reactions to play on words situations, did not direct this movie. Airplane II just resurrects most the original cast from the first film and puts them on a spaceship instead of an airplane with the same jokes. In addition, the humor is a bit more crude. (A joke of a dog being shot with a fake gun, I found disturbing.) There are also some sexual references in the film that I think should have made this movie rated PG-13. However, because this rating was not available from the MPAA at the time of its release in 1982, the film is rated PG. However, I do NOT recommend it to anyone under 13.The cast however makes an honest effort with the time worn material, and there are a couple good laughs but nothing really memorable. The best summery and problem with this movie is that, We have seen it all before. I give Paramount credit for not releasing Airplane III! There is a promo for it at the conclusion of the movie. Either it was thankfully shot down (pun intended) pre-production or something else may have happened to prevent its release. This was a good thing.A second time is more than enough.

Can you tell the Hollywood producers about that? Abrahams and the two Zuckers, or ZAZ, agreed not to do this. Thus, they abandoned this, and evidently took almost all of the hilarity with them, whether or not they intended to do so. That left this with some pieces of comedy, but mostly what there is just hacks, coughs, sputters and dies slowly and painfully before the viewers' eyes. It's not a pretty sight. This is a soulless, less honest spoof. There is arguably more objectionable content in the first five minutes of this than the entirety of its predecessor. The bits that are, at times directly, lifted from it tend to do little other than highlight how little this one has on the one that came before it. Several cast-members return, including the two leads, however, the script they were given leaves them powerless to save this. Even Shat doesn't quite save it(and he certainly does try, and does well with what he had to work with). It would be too harsh and critical, if not by particularly much, to claim that none of this is funny at all(heck, when at its best, which is extremely seldom, it isn't without outright hilarity). It's pretty half-hearted, and comes off as being made for the bucks, not the laughs. The fact remains that it offers next to nothing, and certainly not a thing that comes even remotely close to being worth possibly risking messing up the memory of Airplane!, if one fears an inclination towards that. There's a lot more sexuality(and usually the gags and jokes go on for so long, it ceases to even hold potential for humor... and reach the level of being gratuitous), other offensive material(except for drug references) and language in this. The end credits featuring the as-of-yet-unfulfilled promise of a third entry is really a perfect testament to the failure of this. Perhaps it can at least help deter follow-ups that are useless and uncalled for from being released. It certainly isn't alone. Lastly, let me point out that this is not merely a case of a sequel being a letdown... it's simply not a good film.

Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) is piloting the shuttle, and Striker is forced to fly the plane once again.The repeating of many of the jokes from the first movie is probably very necessary. The style of the franchise hasn't changed. I do like the new joke of Striker's drinking problem. However, the freshness of the original isn't there anymore.

Airplane II The Sequel is the sequel to the critically-acclaimed parody film from 1980 with many of the same elements. For the most part, the story, characters, and jokes are all the same, only this time the film is set in space and is parodying movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey.For the most part, the comedy style for this film was the same one that was used in Airplane! using lots of play-on-words jokes to keep the tone of the first film and did not fall victim to other comedy film sequels where it is nothing but juvenile humor. I did find myself getting annoyed at the fact that there were jokes recycled from the first film like the little boy (Oliver Robins) and Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) and the mix-up with the pilot's names. Another problem was that when a joke happened occasionally, I had thought of a funnier punchline in my head, which took me out of the movie a little and sometimes, the jokes just didn't work.Airplane II The Sequel brought back a number of characters from the first film including Striker (Robert Hays) and Elaine (Julie Hagerty), McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) and Johnny/Jacobs (Stephen Stucker) and featured some new characters like Murdock (William Shatner) and Simon (Chad Everett). The problem is that the returning characters are the only ones who are really funny while the new characters, almost all the time, fall flat. Also, while the characters from Airplane! were funny and memorable, the only memorable characters from this movie are the ones that were brought back from the first film.In the long run, Airplane II The Sequel is a less funny Airplane! set in space. The film had some good jokes that the writers thought up of themselves and the returning characters were good in it, but the same can not be said for the new characters. The jokes, for the most part, were either mediocre or the audience could think of better punchlines for them in their heads, and it did have to borrow a lot of jokes from its predecessor. When it comes down to it, though, Airplane II The Sequel is a comedy sequel that is not as funny as the original, but it manages to make you laugh enough times to make the viewing worthwhile.

The X-ray machine gag is a killer and beautifully set up, ordinary folks show up fully clothed whilst attractive buxom businesswomen and a beautiful mother and her sexy teenage schoolgirl daughter are all naked (I only recently realised that the daughter is B-movie goddess Monique Gabrielle in one of her earliest roles). The courtroom scene, the asylum and everything with the legendary John Vernon is brilliant. The character of Jacobs is also on fine form and absolutely love Chuck Connors as The Sarge. Best line? Controller; Where's Steve McCroskey? Assistant controller; After Regan fired all the air traffic controllers he went completely senile Controller; I know that but what about McCroskey? Assistant controller; Pretty much the same way as ReganNow that's GENIUS! Every time you watch it you see something new, the cannabis deal in the background, the advert for Rocky 26 with a geriatric boxer on the poster, the Iran Air courtesy bus (which must have been damn near the knuckle in 1982!), the warning light in the shuttle's cockpit marked 'Odd' with 2 marked 'Strange' and 'Bizarre' on either side, the boys downtown, it just goes on. If there was one thing missing I would say it is the lack of a song and dance number, Ted and Elaine's disco antics in the first film was one of the greatest scenes. That said the storyline does allow us to mock not only disaster movies as the first one did but also to satirise science fiction, the sophisticated machine you see in the background of every sci-fi epic but which actually has no useful purpose funny because it's so, so true! Never fails to raise a smile no matter how many times I watch it although I'm glad they stopped the series here, it wouldn't have worked if they'd tried to milk it for a third instalment.

Most of the time it's slightly amusing. Most of the time the sequel rides the wave that the first movie created and the writer/director of this movie did nothing to help it, only hurt it.This time the ridiculously silly movie starts off like the last Airplane movie except that this time it's the first commercial shuttle flight to the first colony on the moon. Ted Stryker, played by Robert Hays (Dr. T and the women,) was the test pilot to test the shuttle and after the prototype crashed he was sent to the insane asylum. Meanwhile, the shuttle goes forward with its mission. Stryker escapes and tries to get on the shuttle to stop it. Of course he does, and he tries to stop the mission and get back together with his girlfriend Elaine, played by Julie Hagerty (What about Bob?) OK the first movie was written and directed by Jim Abrams and the Zucker Brothers, David and Jerry. Airplane II was written and directed by Ken Finkleman. I mention this because Finkleman appears to have nothing to do with the first movie, and with very few exceptions he steals every joke from the first movie, makes a minor change to the joke and then puts it in the new film. Doing it once or twice, say like in Austin Powers, its OK, but if most of your jokes are based on the original jokes from the first movie, then it quickly becomes tiresome and unfunny.There are a few jokes that are funny, the beginning with the Iran Air Courtesy shuttle is one, and most of the stuff with William Shatner was funny until the very end. There are some bits and pieces in the middle but Finkleman depends too much on the original jokes and end the end it kills him.The failure of the movie is on Finkleman. Haggerty and Hays and everyone else did a fine job but they weren't shooting another film as much as performing an encore of the previous show. However the one actor who was missing from this movie which was noticeable was Leslie Neilson. He had an uncanny ability and timing for these kinds of movies which made the Naked Gun series so wonderful. His absence hurt the movie.I say if you have never seen the Airplane movies, get the first one, it's the best.

While the destination differs, this sequel has been quite rightly described as more of the same, a characteristic which has its pluses and minuses. On the positive side, returning co-stars Roberts Hays and Julie Hagerty do equally well with the deadpan humour on hand, and the gag ratio is just as high here with some of the funniest moments left to the backdrop (a poster for 'Rocky 38' with an aged Stallone; two foreigners spitting their drinks when they overhear Hays mention a bomb). On the less positive side, several gags are copied directly from the first film without variation, which results in less spontaneity, especially when it comes to overly familiar lines like an emphatic you can tell me. Science fiction (as opposed to disaster films) are, however, the lampoon target here and the futuristic setting allows for greater creativity, especially in terms of sets and costumes. The '2001 A Space Odyssey'/HAL parody is simply excellent and its fun to see William Shatner essentially spoofing his own 'Star Trek' persona. Yes, this sequel may not be as fresh and original as its predecessor, but it is very decent of its sort - even if the film was made without the blessing of the original movie's writer-directors.

The jokes are mostly unfunny, the set-up forced, and the slugs at the Airport series forced rather than fully plotted. This takes the bomb plot of the first film and puts it into the hands of Sonny Bono who buys a bomb in the airport gift shop before boarding a super sonic jet heading for the moon. Once again, Robert Hays is estranged from fiancée Julie Hagerty, having had another breakdown somewhere in between the two movies, and is desperate to get her back. Somehow discovering that Bono has a bomb, Hays becomes a hero again, after the pilots (once again lead by Peter Graves) are afflicted by poisonous gas let out of the computer system let out by a Hal like mind. The first movie was hysterically funny because every gag seemed to be choreographed rather than just tossed on for cheap laughs. The gags here are either repeated or weakly placed without regards to the outcome or the placement. Gone are Leslie Nielsen (seen only in an obvious filler flashback) and Robert Stack, here replaced in a different part by William Shatner, obviously spoofing his Star Trek role, and he gets the funniest visual gag. Lloyd Bridges and Stephen Stucker are back as are a few of the same passengers, with Ann Nelson very funny in her cameo, but poor Lee Bryant reduced to further hysterics that uses a flashback and comes off as more gratuitous than funny. I missed Lorna Patterson, seen in the same flashback, but a definite sad absence. I wanted to see more of future soap diva Louise Sorel, seen briefly as a nurse.A sad follow-up to one of the greatest comedies ever made took the spoof out of filmmaking until the Naked Gun series came along.

The cast are all good sports, with many of the original players reprising their roles (Bridges is the best), some wacky cameos (Burr as a judge, Bono as a mad bomber) and most enjoyably, a hilarious appearance by Shatner who good-naturedly spoofs his own neurotic Captain Kirk sensibilities. It's not as funny as the first movie for me, partly since Leslie Nielsen is absent, but mostly because it's pretty much a stream of gags, with only some satire of the form. What's really funny about this subject material I think is that people make (and watch) movies like Airport 1975 or Outbreak and pretend they're serious. Roland Emmerich's films are great fun but also faintly ridiculous, but that quality is part of their appeal (at least for me). Airplane II has some great jokes and satire of other movies and TV shows (notably Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and 2001) for the savvy viewer but is not as good at spoofing disaster flicks in general.

The first ten minutes, where we see how the various parts of the airport work (or don't work) are quite good, as is one of the few original gags (a spoof of 2001 A Space Odyssey and MissionImpossible - in the same shot!). Otherwise, it's all stuff we've already seen, as Finkleman thinks he can successfully entertain us by reviving the same characters (Peter Graves'perverted pilot) and visual gags (the deadly effects of Striker's I love Elaine monologues, part of the Saturday Night Fever parody, et al). Shame he didn't bring back the one guy who would have made a difference Leslie Nielsen. He was the best element of Airplane!, yet he's absent in the sequel. There are a few new entries (Raymond Burr as a judge and William Shatner playing an astronaut) who may induce a smile in film-buffs, but sadly, no laughter.Those who haven't seen the original Airplane!

Jokes come thick and fast in this ninety-minute piece - so fast, in fact, that if we blink an eye we are likely to miss them. While some of them are extremely funny, many of them might also be considered extremely sexist, involving nymphomaniac virgins (a deliberate contradiction), clerics giving blow-jobs, repeated close-ups of female breasts. Other jokes might be thought of as simply taboo in today's world (for example, implied references to pedophilia and/or bestiality). Nonetheless AIRPLANE 2 offers a good example of great character actors from US television of the Sixties and Seventies - Lloyd Bridges, Chad Everett, Peter Graves, Chuck Connors - being willing to make fun of themselves on screen. They might have had no choice (especially if their found work difficult to come by after their respective series had concluded), but they clearly relish the opportunity to deliver their ridiculous lines with deadpan seriousness. Shatner is especially good as a service commander charged with the responsibility of bringing the stricken ship to a safe landing (he fails, by the way).

The Japanese guy understands English so when he hears 'this ship could blow any second' he spits out his drink. The Chinese asks what that was and the Japanese guy translates.

This story in the paper would be fun if carefully developed and with the obvious and reliable humored and crazy moments. But the major basis of it, it's amazingly flawed with a stupid plot hole (Stryker is confined in a hospital and then all of sudden, without being warned or anything, he escapes and bingo, he's the hero again). The first Airplane was a ammunition of great laughs at each second, non stop. Its follow up tries the same, succeed for a good time, mostly in its first minutes presenting the passengers but the more it develops, the more it loses some fun - except for all scenes with Bridges and the priceless signs exposed in the plane (Don't Panic!

Between stories, Striker was the scapegoat for the flight failure that occured in Airplane I which he had to save the passengers and crew from, the plane about to go down in a blaze after the captain and crew got food poisoning. But, they didn't give Striker credit where credit was due, and instead, he wound up in a mental institution. It doesn't make much sense, but that's what we've got to go on.Striker was, however, notified of a flight to Saturn (using airplanes now to travel into space), and one that would take off against his warnings that it was too dangerous. So, he busts out and tries to convince those in control of the mission that it is bad news. Well, actually, that just means convincing his old flame, Elaine, who is now engaged to marry a creepy flight commander. What happens in Striker winds up one the plane after take off, and concerns himself with the futile efforts of trying to convince Elaine that they should be together. Meanwhile, the airplane is being controlled by a computer that malfunctions. The crew can't initiate a backup system to turn the plane around and return everyone to saftey, and instead, the computer jammed and the crew is headed to the sun. That, an a fragile (impotent) passenger (Sonny Bono) is armed with a bomb. Striker's got a lot of trouble on his hands, because once again, they need his help (and Elaine's) to save the day. The movie is funny in it's own right, but doesn't fare as well when compared to the outrageously funny Airplane. I think that is in part because both Leslie Neilsen and Robert Stack are absent, and they generated quite a lot of jokes in the first one. Although, Lloyd Bridges (returning as the air traffic controller) and William Shatner both offer many good laughs in spite of that. And, at times, it appears as though the filmmakers tried a little too hard for some of the non-stop stupid humor gags, sometimes even repeating those of the first movie.

This sequel isn't about to mess with a winning formula, so the basic idea is the same. Ace pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) is no longer such a neurotic mess - although he still has his moments of self-doubt - as he's forced to take over the controls to the first manned space shuttle to the moon, which has been colonized. Fortunately for him, also along for the ride is old girlfriend Elaine (Julie Hagerty). The absence of the Zucker - Abrahams - Zucker filmmaking team is palpable as new writer / director Ken Finkleman tries his best to both revisit previously used jokes and come up with some of his own. He doesn't do too bad a job - there are some genuine laughs to be had, as movies such as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and 2001 A Space Odyssey are parodied - but the review in the annual Maltin paperback guide to movies is actually spot on when it says that the quality of the jokes just isn't the same, nor are the laughs quite as frequent. The cast tries hard with the material, and they're still fun to watch. One good thing is that Finkleman is able to keep up the tradition of having things happen in both foreground and background so that viewers are required to pay attention to catch all the gags. Hays and Hagerty are just as endearing as they were in the first film, and are supported by Chad Everett (as the slimy Simon) and returning players from Airplane! such as Peter Graves (continuing with the inappropriate questions), zany Stephen Stucker as the character Jacobs, Al White as the jive talking witness, David Leisure as one of the Transcendental Air guys, Lee Bryant as Mrs. Hammen, and Lloyd Bridges as the harried Steve McCroskey. Robert Stack, Leslie Nielsen, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar are sorely missed, but Finkleman does pack his film with cameos - Chuck Connors, William Shatner (doing some priceless Shatner style over acting), Raymond Burr, John Vernon, John Dehner, Rip Torn, Sonny Bono, Richard Jaeckel, Jack Jones (singing the 'Love Boat' theme), Art Fleming, etc. Plenty of other recognizable performers, too Laurene Landon, John Larch, John Hancock, Oliver Robins, Leon Askin, Sandahl Bergman, James Noble, Rick Overton, David Paymer, Pat Sajak (!); sitcom stars George Wendt and Joyce DeWitt have uncredited bits, as does super sexy Monique Gabrielle as the gal who has a delicious way of dealing with imminent doom. There's enough good stuff here to make for pleasant if not hilarious fare. Among the best bits the trial sequence, the dealings with omnipotent computer R.O.K., and the outer space scenes with Shatner. This may not be in the same league as its predecessor, but for a sequel it's not bad at all. Seven out of 10.

It is a regressive process; doing so allows the pervasive nonsequiturs and irrationalities which make inherent sense in the context of language, or that we choose to accept as making sense for the sake of convenience, to be revealed as just how absurd they can be. How absurd our entire thought cosmology (communicated in language) often is. It is a smart idea, even if milked for all its worth.

The original Airplane! is often cited as being the Godfather of spoofs, paving the way for the likes of The Naked Gun and Top Secret!. But Paramount, in their wisdom, felt that a sequel was required and duly produced this carbon-copy. And it is remarkable how similar to the original this is - mostly the same cast, mostly the same script and almost certainly the same jokes. Trouble is, it lacks the humour and edge the first film had which makes this disappointing and limp by comparison.When the first passenger flight to the Moon is preparing to launch, former stewardess Elaine (Julie Hagerty) is joining her pilot partner Simon (Chad Everett) on board. But the Mayflower 1 is plagued by mechanical problems and cost-cutting and its former test pilot Ted Striker (Robert Hays) knows this. Trouble is, he's been committed to a mental hospital after repeated flashbacks to a traumatic experience during the war. Busting out to try and save the passengers, Striker also finds himself dealing with a paranoid bomber (Sonny Bono), a rebellious computer (voiced by director Ken Finkleman) and his old war buddy Murdock (William Shatner). Oh and his own incompetence.Filled with all the sight gags and one-liners you enjoyed in the first film, Airplane II The Sequel offers viewers the chance to enjoy them all over again. Which is fine if you haven't got the original on DVD or if you haven't seen them before. But I have which kinda makes this film redundant. It wouldn't be so bad if it was as funny as the first but it isn't, at least not all the way through. Other characters are funnier than others - Clarence Oveur (Peter Graves) returns but sadly, the true star of the first film Leslie Nielsen is absent and is sorely missed. Hays and Hagerty hit the lines as required but they seem to be lacking in enthusiasm somewhat. The frustrating thing is that it doesn't feel like a quality product. The other notable thing is that the directors of the first film (Jim Abrahams and Zuckers David and Jerry) had nothing to do with this effort and without the spiritual heart of the film involved, you do wonder what the point of it all is.I wanted to really enjoy this but this lacklustre sequel is a massive disappointment. It is weaker in almost every respect and a lot of the humour has dated quite badly - even the jive-talking passenger from the first film is subtitled. It just doesn't feel right and given the strength of the first film, I was afraid that this was going to be the case. Even Shatner's appearance is little more than a cameo though his acting seems to fit the movie, for once. Still, for spoof fans this movie really doesn't cut the mustard. But don't despair because if you want a genuinely funny, riotous disaster spoof that shocks as much as it batters you into submission with gags then there is another film for you. It's called Airplane! and that's the one you should stick with.

At the end, giving Hayes a pep talk long after Hayes has brought the airplane down, Stack has some hilarious lines about being kicked with a rubber boot and investing in municipal bonds.Here, the role is taken by William Shatner, who is very much aware that this is a farce and who hams it up outrageously. Instead of the mirror trick, someone contacts him by tuning in a television screen. After an argument, Shatner opens the door in which the screen is embedded and stomps through it.His dialog is almost as good as Stack's. He asks Rorschach for a report. Rorschach hands him three ink blots, and Shatner, pointing at them one by one, rattles off something like, That's a dog, that's an elephant, that's a horse with a hat on, then steps hurriedly away.It may not be as fresh or innovative as the original but some of the gags are pretty funny. Alas, Julie Haggerty, with her maniacal grin and pop eyes, is fine, but Robert Hayes is not much more than blandly handsome and isn't very good as the lead.

Why is that ? Give me the honor.._True that (Ken Finkleman) as a writer and director made a fine effort to track down the splendid quality of comedy that the original movie brought, but when it comes to the direction some of the vitality was lost. Of course the cartoonish sense, the literal-visual jokes, the parodied movies, the absurd dialog are already here, but not wholly effective as independent, and less powerful compared to the first (Airplane !)._The reoccurrence !, it comes here with so many types. The repetitive plot, relationships, and reactions. The repetitive kind of jokes from the first movie (people get bored out of Striker's story, drunken McCroskey, panicked fighting passengers,.. etc). Even the big mistake of putting one scene from the first again (the frightened woman got hit consecutively to be calm !). And repeating the same kind of joke in the same movie (the what is it ?, it's a.. routine)._The absence of the stars, any stars, in the case of having everybody from the original doing their things again and again. Surely it gives the parody a certain conscience before being a reason of attraction, since the presence of the stars grants to the joke a heart and recognition of being right, look at (George Kennedy) desperately wants to be at the original Airplane to spoof his role as (Joe Patroni) in all of the (airport)'s series ; desire you may understand not only because of his weariness out of repetition but also because of being in the shameful last sequel  The Concorde-79 ! (He compensated it but through another parody  The Naked Gun's movies). Here the movie was deprived of having that treat, and missed a new faces and talents._Some shortcomings  lacking of parody as the movies that were being spoofed were little, so let's take on the TV shows heavily this time (Mission Impassible, Star Trek, ..etc). William Shatner did it fair, yet he is basically not that fair as a comedian. The music didn't try to give it some ironic seriousness, or good impressions (most likely repeating from the first). And I just missed (Lorna Patterson) as a stewardess from the original, OH MY GOD, she was so sexy, I waited for bigger role to not find her at all ! Still one Disaster / Sci-Fi / Parody movie that took place in just less than night. I liked the most the spoof of (2001 A Space Odyssey - 1968) &#150; that's a movie screams to be spoofed &#150; what a wicked moment when the plane starts to launch in super speed to see the swift colorful lights then (Julie Hagerty) starts to smoke grass; it was a good mockery at Kubrick's film as well as its fans too ! (David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams) are the ones whom made a personality for the parody movie in the American cinema since their hit (Airplane) which got an Arabic commercial title in Egypt when it first came out stands for (Insane People above the Air). Clearly, this time, they weren't that insane. Makes me suspect, could (Ken Finkleman) be an alias for the triple team of parody ?, maybe they had disagreement with the production company (or themselves) to go for the (Alan Smithee) solution and replace their names with another one on their unsatisfying work ?! As you see the status of the movie makes me think that way.Apparently it's not (Airplane II The Sequel), it's (Airplane.. Again !).. and that, apart, is low point, so how about more defects. I think mentioning the term sequel in the title was a marked way from the movie to mock at the many sequels' tradition as exploitation, however it almost applied to the movie itself as well !

Ted Striker is going in a flight again. This film appears to take place in the future, in which the space shuttle is going to the moon. He also tries to win Elaine Dickinson's heart back. Problem starts to arise when there's a passenger carrying a bomb and a faulty computer leading the ship their way to the Sun. Could Ted Striker land the shuttle safely...again?This movie looks like a promising sequel with most of the cast returning but having a different crew. Mostly, all the jokes were recycled, making the movie feeling like a repeat on the original, with an exception on some parts of the film.Having said that, most of the re-used and new jokes were funny. Sometimes some jokes gets irritating but overall, the film is funny. This film also looks like to have a bigger budget with good special effects when the movie was made in the 80's. This film also uses more brief nudity, that I find unnecessary.Overall, the film is funny and is very enjoyable. The acting were good by Robert Hays and Julie Hagerty. So if you don't mind the repeated jokes or plot, you'll have a good time.

The movie is a parody mostly of CONCORD AIRPORT 79 although it doesn't say that on here.This movie was short on laughs and the writers from part one claim to have never seen it and were extremely against it. It was a flop for good reason as it was short on laughs and it's best parts were actually a bunch of parodies from part 1, replicating them almost exact in many ways. It did have a few parodies of other films such as STAR WARS, STAR TREK, obviously the AIRPORT films, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, THE LOVE BOAT (even having the great Jack Jones singing the theme), there is a funny poster of ROCKY 38, very obvious references to HAL from 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY and much more.Ken Finkleman wrote and directed and he didn't do a great job at either. Acting wise we had Robert Hayes and Julie Hagarty back on lead. Llyoyd Bridges and Peter Graves reprised their roles and we had great new people on board like William Shatner (who was the best thing and funniest guy on the film), Sonny Bono, Rip Torn, Chuck Conners and Raymond Burr (as the judge). The film also had small roles for people like George Wendt, Joyce Dewitt (uncredited as a juror), Sam Anderson, Pat Seyjack and John Vernon. Stephen Strucker was back as the annoying gay guy and I hated his character on both.The movie just wasn't that funny, it had some laughs but they were few and far between, it's hard to set through, every time I have watched it I found myself losing interest. 2/10 stars.

For some reason a lot of people seem to hate Airplane II with a vengeance but it's really not all that bad - you just have to watch it with low expectations and not expecting a sequel on-par with the original.Of course the novelty has worn off, and that's part of the problem. Here, most of the original cast returns in a plot centered around a new space travel program - pretty much the exact same thing happens as in the first film...only this one takes place in outer space.

It's not as good as the original, but then, nothing is. Too many of the jokes are taken from the original but there are still some good ones here. One of my favourite gags is when Captain Oveur is trying to shut down the computer, this scene manages to spoof 2001 and Peter Graves' role in the Mission Impossible TV series simultaneously. The shift to a space setting allows for the sequel to spoof a few sci-fi classics as well, including the scrolling text opening from Star Wars. This film also contains one of the rarest things in the world, a performance from William Shatner that doesn't make you want to punch him! He plays his role with gusto and there is a great moment when he looks through the periscope and sees the Starship Enterprise.Overall I would describe this as a good movie, but it's probably not a good idea to compare it to the original or you will be disappointed.
