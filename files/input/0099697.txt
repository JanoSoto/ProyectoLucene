It sure ain't no big masterpiece but it got several things going for it. Though, there is ONE aspect that makes this film very memorable ! The very creepy atmosphere. Graveyard Shift takes place is a textile factory during a very hot summer. Temperatures are so high, the men have to work at night...during the Graveyard Shift !You can actually feel the heat these men are working in. You can feel the sweat running down their back and you can feel the dirt on their bodies, caused by the hard work. That's a very good mood being set. When it comes to the level of scary I would dare to say that some scenes equal to that of Arachnophobia... Because the hideous little creatures here are rats, and these animals scare and disgust people as much as spiders do. Graveyard Shift contains some great acting performances as well. Andrew Divoff is a decent actor and the guy who plays Warwick is fantastic ! He has the face of a natural born bastard so the role he plays fits him very well. I don't know his name but he reminds me of Fred Ward. I'll keep my eyes open for possible other movies he starred in. And then there's ...Brad Dourif!! This guy always delivers !!! Whether he plays in big budget productions like LOTR The Two Towers or in small obscure horror films, he's always brilliant. Especially here, as the Exterminator. His little Vietnam anecdote is the best scene in the whole film. He's still too underrated, if you ask me. So these are all good elements, no ? Then, why is Graveyard Shift not up there with the big titles in the genre? Well, the low budget obviously killed this movie. Most scenes are very dark and hard to follow. The big monster is supposed to be very impressive, but you're never able to see it properly. Half of the time, you're wondering what? ...what happened ?? Real shame and waste. I'm convinced that with a few clear and decent special effects and make-up, this movie could have been one of the best horror films of the 90's.

Still, there are a lot of silly horror flicks that were released in the 90's debut year, and, surprisingly, this one isn't all that bad. It lacks all the elements that make great films great films, of course; things such as brains, coherency and any whisper of characters has been neglected in favour of monster special effects and a few nice death scenes; but seriously, that's all you want from a film like this, so to say that Graveyard Shift does it's job isn't wrong. The film is based on a short story by Stephen King. Nearly everything that King has ever touched has been turned into a film, with a lot of mixed results. I would put this one in the middling category, which isn't a bad place to be in considering all the failed adaptations. The plot is typically thin (it is a SHORT story!) and it follows a man who gets a job in a cotton mill. The place is infested with rats, and after being charged with cleaning the place up, our hero finds a trapdoor and soon he and his team are up against the reason rats have made their home in the mill...One thing that really stands out about this film is the atmosphere. Director Ralph S. Singleton delights in presenting a fetid and disturbing aura around the central location, and this helps the story massively and gives the film an almost 'odyssey' approach when the characters finally make their way underground. I don't find rats scary, personally, but many people do and this film could easily be a reason why! The way that the rats surround the characters is brooding and frightening and provides the film with one of it's key elements. Acting definitely isn't a key element of Graveyard Shift, but the appearance of popular cult actor Brad Dourif will please many of this films' audience. I'm not a massive of fan of Dourif personally, but I respect his ability to shine in campy productions. The story doesn't offer anything in the way of a point, and it's incoherency will annoy many - but if you go into this film with the right sort of expectations, and don't think you're about to see a horror classic, Graveyard Shift really shouldn't disappoint.

It's so f**king intense from start to finish that it makes Stanley Kubrick's The Shining look like a Hallmark movie. The studio executives no doubt wanted to make a few bucks with a by-the-numbers B-movie and chose the director based on his past experience on a number of respectable movies; no one could have predicted that he'd go balls-out crazy and treat a story about a mutant rat monster as if he'd been handed the script to Macbeth. A drifter named John arrives in the town of Gate's Falls and applies for a job in a rat-infested textile mill run by Mr. Warwick (played by an unknown actor named Stephen Macht, whose attempted Maine accent sounds more Transylvanian), a deliriously evil man who rules not only the mill, but the entire town, with an iron fist. Warwick regularly strolls through the mill to laugh at how exhausted everyone is and knowingly sends his employees to their doom in the basement, which is inhabited by a huge rat-bat hybrid. This seems like an extremely counterproductive way to run a business, but it's best not to question anything in this movie. Meanwhile, an exterminator gone wrong (Brad Dourif's performance will give you nightmares) attempts to flush out the mill's rats, and John sort of develops a relationship with the mill's secretary, although even the romantic scenes are not handled calmly. As an example of the film's overall mood, at one point Warwick sends John to help clean the basement; the script probably said, Warwick sends John to clean the basement, but it plays out with Warwick and John staring each other down wild-eyed as if Warwick had challenged John to a death-match; it is indeed the most intense one character asks another to do a simple task scene in history.Basically everything in the movie is like that, until the final sequence, at which point the maniacal director apparently tore the script into confetti and threw it into the air, because all nine levels of hell break loose. Our small cleaning crew, including Warwick, descends through a trapdoor and finds itself lost in a maze of wooden tunnels, the mill being some kind of labyrinthine, House of Leaves-style structure that extends hundreds of feet below the surface of the earth, and the rat-bat begins killing them off. Warwick goes completely off the beam at this time and begins chasing John and his girlfriend through the tunnels after smearing his face full of black grease. He encounters the rat-beast and throws himself at it, screaming, We're going to hell... TOGETHUUUHHH!!! Somehow, John and Jane descend even DEEPER, and end up in a MASSIVE cavern packed full of human bones; I could only imagine the director running around foaming at the mouth as he told his set design crew he needed the most gigantic cavern ever put on screen. Then, through some miracle, our man John makes it back into the textile mill and defeats the monster using, and this is no less crazy than it sounds, a Pepsi can. These final scenes are exhausting, but the movie isn't about to let some trifle like an ending release its grip on the viewer, because a nightmarish theme song then begins playing consisting of a bizarre techno beat with sounds of industrial machinery and bits of dialogue mixed over it. The tremendous amount of effort that was put into this thing forces me to rate it 8/10; any less and I am afraid the director might track me down and cut out my eyes or something. In conclusion, see it.

In contrast to many other recent horror-movies (take The Mummy for instance) the special effects are not generally exploiting gory, in-depth looks at the monsters (which almost always tend to ruin much of the real horror, i e where you yourself fill in on the aspects not covered by the camera; a commendable example of this last aspect would be the first Alien, where the monster often only is shown in extreme short-cut scenes). Anyway, what made the film stand out is, however, not the spare use of monster-over exposure but the social setting of the plot. Unlike many other American stories, which seem to be set in rather idyllic surroundings (but for the appearance of the monster, that is!), this film actually lay out a more grim, perspective The owners and the manager of the plant are basically exploiting the workers in search of greater profits, the possibilities of getting other jobs seem slim, the local people is not very keen on strangers and peoplesÂ´ basic attitudes towards each other often seem to range between distrust and hostility. This creates a darker, more menacing setting for the everyday life than could be expected; something I find much more interesting than the ordinary everything here was so fine until the monster arrived to our idyllic town-plot. If one likes to think about symbolic interpretations of horror movies (and why not? Even Stephen King does this in his book Dance Macabre), one could perhaps state that the monster in some way could be perceived as the physical manifestation of all hostility, exploitation and other bad feelings which seem to prevail in the little society depicted;-)To top it all (warning- spoiler ahead!), given what happens to one of the sympathetic characters very close to the end of the movie, there is not a really wholeheartedly happy ending Quite extraordinary if you think about that this actually is an American movie! To summarize This is a horror movie which, in many positive ways, feels like it was made by an independent company!

It certainly has enough filth, garbage & rats to satisfy anyone who loves to immerse themselves in low-rent horror.Down in the bowels of a cotton mill lives something quite sinister, with an appetite for factory workers who venture anywhere near his lair.John Hall(Dana Andrews, who is simply a lifeless blank)is a mysterious drifter who wanders into the position of running a Graveyard Shift textile machine once operated by someone else who saw something massive and fell it that blasted machine providing the rats with nourishment. Warwick(Stephen Macht, a hoot as he overextends his character's menace to the extreme) is the manager of the mill with a bit of a nasty streak which hides under a vile visage. Tucker Cleveland(Brad Dourif, who easily steals the film with his limited time on screen)is the exterminator of the mill who works day and night wasting those rat-vermin who wish to rear their ugly heads from the bowels. This mill should've been closed down forever, but Warwick has a way of extending time for a 4th of July clean-up where those who decide to work for double-pay, including Hall and his love-interest Jane(Kelly Wolf), will find true horror down in the basement of the place.I have no right whatsoever recommending this hunk of pure trash to anyone, but those who enjoy rats and garbage may find it amusing. It's full of nefarious, colorfully animated characters like Macht's evil manager and Dourif's exterminator which may bring a delight to trash-lovers everywhere. Highlights include Dourif's exterminator explaining to Hall about an experience in Vietnam which inspired his choice of occupation where a prisoner of war is used as meat for specially trained rats(as he expresses in exact detail, Dourif gets so caught up in the intensity of the character he sheds a tear..that ought to bring a bit of respect from some that an actor of his caliber would care so much to give away part of himself to such a rotten movie), or how Hall traps the monster in the textile machine.But how Warwick goes over the edge, insanely with face paint used from grease of an old jar, as he chases after the creature has to be the ultimate highlight.I think the best audience for this type of film is those lovers of bad Creature features, because in it's own ugly way, this film can be entertaining. But, it doesn't have one good bone in it's body, so others might wish to stay as far away as possible.

Perhaps this is as gory and bizarre as the novel itself. I believe Stephen King has a guardian angel that is always atop his head, inspiring him bring out the most unusual horrific thoughts. As far as the budget is concerned, GS is mediocre but the way this tale has been presented makes this film bit outlandish. The plot is simple, but the cause is freaky. The cinematography is great and gives a strange sullen atmosphere to the movie. The film has enough offering for the gore-hounds, who would love this flick for splatter reasons. The plot would have worked well even if it were incorporated in any of anthologies like 'Tales from the Darkside aka Creepshow 3.A run down textile mill is restarted by a firm. The owners appoint a grouchy and malevolent supervisor Warwick (Macht) to make new recruitment and keep the production on the go. The exterminators, specially Brad Douriff discovers that the mill is infested with rats. The population of the rodents is so high, that they have dug big holes in the mill premises. We soon watch John Hall (David Andrews) taking role of a night shift worker. Others are astonished to see John take the night shift. The shift has a notorious past, because it took the life of old workers. We also come to know that the deaths have something to do with rats. Andrews soon assumes his responsibility and is time and again bugged by the presence of rats. He manages to fend some of them with an empty cola can and sling. John is bullied by his fellows Danson (Divoff) and Brogan (Polizos), but he wants to keep his profile low. John also shares some pleasant intimacy with his co-worker Jane (Kelly Wolf), which is despised by Warwick. Time goes by and other incidents of disappearances take place. Searching for the clue, the exterminator Douriff scans the nearby graveyard and discovers a tunnel. Before he could track the channels, he is crushed under a tombstone. Warwick compels the workers to participate in the extermination program. Unfortunately, the team stumbles upon a chain of interconnected tunnels, that lead to a nearby graveyard. One by one the workers are killed by something unimaginable, that rests and breeds inside this tunnel waiting for the good time. However, John still has his time for the final showdown.The film succeeds in taking the viewers to discomfort. Unlike any other ambiguous horror farce that is trashed out in the name of horror, this doesn't lose grip. A newbie to horror may take it for a slow starter and soon start pigeonholing this gem of a film with other inferior squibs. This film has a strange atmosphere, that gets tedious and intolerable due to the presence of rats. Well, consider yourself working past midnight at a mill with no ventilation, heavily enervated and badly perspiring. Then to add to your troubles, you are alone, and furthermore you are surrounded by several hundred rodents, that are smelly and also HUNGRY! How do you think you'll react to this? Well watch GS to believe it. Cheers to Ralph Singleton!

Meanwhile, a few other people have been murdered by a mysterious creature roaming the workplace. Also there is a hoard of rats down there which love to lick up human blood. So as soon as the cleaning crew start their work, they get attacked by the huge creature and many of them die. The creature's death at the end is done well, but it doesn't make up for the boring movie.Now, I still don't know what the hell the huge creature is at the end. It's supposed to be a giant rat (I think) but it looks like a bat. Maybe it's a mutation, who knows? It does look gruesome though. The death scenes involve lots of gruesome gore as well. The problem with this film, which was originally a short story, is that it goes on and on too long. It's very dull and just plain boring at times. And I have to say watching this film, I wonder if the actors were told not to shower at all during the making of it. They all looked so dirty and nasty. The grittiness of the movie is at an extreme.And all of the characters are plain scum. As viewers you root for them to die in a way just so they'll shut up. Like the guy down in the basement killing rats with a water hose. Did he have to scream every time he pumped out the water? That scene went on for a good three minutes. I couldn't wait for him to be off my screen. This is one of Stephen's King's worst adaptions.

This one begged to be filmed, given the deliciously disturbing short story from which it was lifted, but the end result is, alas, a mess.The film keeps close to the source material, but padding it out to feature length stretches the material too thin. It also jettisons the short story's concept of a small ecosystem of mutated rats--the characters simply have a severe rat infestation to deal with, and a single mutated bat creature that appears when the script dictates that a character is isolated enough for a monster attack.The acting is above par for what seems to have been a very rushed production, given the shambles of a script it provides for them. There's little suspense, and although I was willing to suspend disbelief and imagine that a textile mill could have a series of what appears to be 15 basements, I wasn't willing to sit through the obviously plot threads that go nowhere. Much is made of the mill boss and his sadistic manner of treating people, so much so that the early portions of the film become redundant. There are a few too many extraneous characters, not the least of which is an exterminator played by Brad Dourif. Dourif brings a little more dimension that necessary to the part, which requires so little of him that he never even gets to confront the monster for his death scene--he's killed by a sliding coffin. Who thought that up? The creature itself is fantastic, and apart from the decent performances, it's the best thing about Graveyard Shift.

If you want a bottom of the barrel Stephen King film, look no further than this travesty.Set in a cotton mill in what I guess is supposed to be Maine (one character references Castle Rock, King's well known fictional Maine town), Graveyard Shift begins with a character who likes to shoot rats with rocks being attacked by . . . something . . . and then dying in the cotton picker. Into town walks John Hall (Dave Andrews) a drifter looking for work, who lands a job at the mill, under the direction of the rather unkind, and potentially unhinged, foreman, Warwick (Stephen Macht). Warwick is a rather despicable character, using the female employees to fulfill his sexual needs while trying to cut a few bucks here and there in regards to worker safety. When he is ordered to clean up the basement or be shut down, he recruits several of the plant workers for the job, but they quickly realize that there is . . . something . . . down there in the basement with them.Graveyard Shift is the kind of film that used to be cranked out in the 1970s and 80s by major studios, I suspect, because they were cheap to make and even with a lower than average box office compared to major films, they still managed to turn a decent profit for the studio. Because it is almost certain no one was greenlighting Graveyard Shift because it promised to be a good movie. And a good movie is definitely not what director Ralph S. Singleton and screenwriter Jon Esposito have supplied. There is nothing of value in Graveyard Shift. The characters are almost exclusively ciphers, existing for no other reason than to be picked off one by one by the film's creature that lives in the mill. Main character John Hall has no development to speak of, and the attempt by the filmmakers to create a relationship between him and female worker Jane (Kelly Wolf) is dead on arrival. Neither character is interesting, or heck, even really present, other than to serve as something for the camera to be focused on most of the time.Stephen Macht provides a seemingly hissable villain in the form of Warwick, but he is almost completely a caricature, a creation of the screenplay to give us someone to root against, not a three dimensional character. When he goes off his rocker towards the end of the film, it is completely out of left field, not something that has been building throughout the narrative. The only character who is even vaguely interesting is the exterminator called in to deal with the rat problem at the mill, played by Brad Dourif. His exterminator holds a personal vendetta against rats due to their use in torture when he was in Vietnam (and I wonder if some material intended for his character was transplanted to Warwick at some point in the re-write stage of development). But slightly interesting doesn't equal necessary, and Dourif's character is even given the weakest, most pointless send-off of any of the film's characters.The makeup effects of the creature are acceptable, I guess, but we are never given much of a good look at it. But, for the most part, the film's gore quotient, one of the reasons people would show up to these films, is pretty limited. And there is certainly no tension, scares or suspense to speak of. Never once was I concerned for anyone on screen, and there is a jump scare or two, but nothing remarkable, and many of them are predictable.Graveyard Shift was released in 1990, at the end of the horror film era of the previous two decades, before the genre would go into remission for a few years before being re-born with the self referential Scream series followed by Hollywood's brief dalliance with J-Horror. And frankly, if Graveyard Shift is representative of what the genre brought to the table, then it was deserving of being buried.

Graveyard Shift is one such rancid production, a film whose sheer badness on almost every level makes it a slightly hypnotic, let's-see-how-much-worse-it-can-get venture, but mostly winds up a jaw-dropping exercise in futility. Based on the short story of the same name from King's Night Shift anthology, one would think a 90-minute film would be the ideal forum to iron out the nuances of a compact literary piece. Then again, that would require filmmakers who know how to expand the material in a creative, interesting way, and one of Graveyard Shift's many problems is that the source story isn't the greatest, and John Esposito's adaptation and Ralph Singleton's direction doesn't know where to go with it. While this tale of textile-mill workers abused by a shifty, sadistic foreman (Stephen Macht) and menaced by a subterranean rat-bat seems a muddled allegory for the human rat race being a literal dive into the darkest pit of Hell, it is lost in the onslaught of terrible acting and unfocused characters. While King (not to mention directors who understand his work) brings a certain local quirkiness to his patented New Englanders, here they are transformed into grotesque, unpleasant yokels whose punchlines fall completely flat (the worst miscalculation being Brad Dourif's hambone Exterminator)&#150;the violence lacks any irony, and is just more grist for the blood-spattered mill. The only remotely credible actor is Macht, whose performance hints at campy greatness that goes unrealized as a result of the script's awkward attempts at intentional comedy. The only thing that really gives Graveyard Shift any redeeming value is the often-creative set design (including an underground labyrinth that threatens to create actual atmosphere), and the not-bad (but far from great) creature FX; additionally, the small New England town does evoke King's prose with some credibility&#150;it's too bad nobody could think of a way to put it to good use.

From its poor (mis)direction by clueless first-time director Ralph S. Singleton to its nonsensical clichÃ©-ridden script by John Esposito to the moronic behavior of the vapid cardboard characters (who all have the appeal of a toxic waste spill), Graveyard Shift is rotten to its crummy core and such a stupendously sorry waste of time that it isn't even enjoyably bad. Instead it's just plain dreadful in a very grating, grueling and depressing sort of way. Acting wise, the insipid and underwhelming David Andrews makes for a bland hero as a college dropout drifter while Stephen Macht overacts atrociously as Warwick, a nasty mill boss with a ludicrously thick'n'heavy Cajun accent whose senseless and abrupt last reel descent into complete psychotic insanity is both laughable and implausible. Kelly Wolf tries hard as the feisty heroine, but her thankless token female role is grossly underwritten and her brutal untimely demise leaves a foul aftertaste. The grungy cinematography and filthy set design ensure that this picture is a real ugly eyesore as well. Not even some good gore f/x by Gordon (Near Dark) Smith and the always riveting presence of perennial oddball Brad Dourif as eccentric, ill-fated 'Nam vet exterminator Tucker Cleveland can redeem this dismal dud. And the horrendous ending credits rap theme song with sampled dialogue is downright painful. The absolute pits.

It also has a small run down graveyard next to it that is constantly enshrouded in mist and fog, no matter how sunny and clear it is elsewhere. It's late at night, a worker is operating a machine called a 'picker'. He notices rats everywhere, the mill is infested with them. He picks one up and puts it into the machine which slices the rat up into little pieces. Then he notices a shadow, someone or something is behind him, he turns around there is a loud squealing noise, he screams and falls into the machine. Chopped up bits of his body emerge from the other side which the rats begin to nibble on. This unfortunate 'accident' means there is a job vacancy at the mill. A drifter named John Halls (David Andrews) wanders into town and sees an advert in a local diner for the position at 'Bachman Mills'. He talks to the supervisor, Mr. Warwick (Stephen Macht) and is given the job, that of operating the picker from 11pm to 7am which is dubbed the 'graveyard shift'. Shortly after starting work Warwick gives Halls a chance to earn double pay. He is assembling a clean up crew to tidy up the basement. Halls agrees, along with four other workers Charlie Carmicheal (Jimmy Woodward), Brogan (Vic Polizos), Danson (Andrew Divoff) and Warwick's ex wife Jane Wisconsky (Kelly Wolf). While cleaning up Halls discovers a trap door, they all venture down inside only to become trapped and be killed off one by one by a giant rat-bat monster!Directed by Ralph S. Singleton this is a seriously poor, stupid and incredibly clichÃ©d horror film. The script by John Esposito based on a short story by Stephen King is terrible. The fog enshrouded graveyard, characters who argue with each other and split up rather than help each other to survive, a stupid over-the-top exterminator (Brad Dourif) who takes his job ridiculously seriously and rambles incoherently on about past exploits and Vietnamese trained rats who becomes the 'comedy relief' plus a blossoming relationship between the two leads which becomes stronger as the film goes on because of the situation they find themselves in. Every clichÃ© in the book is here, you can easily figure out who's going to die and who's going to survive. The scenes in between the rat-bat monster attacks are really dull and uninteresting, I just sat there waiting for the next special effects scene hoping it's not too far away. No explanation for the giant rat-bat monster is given at all, not a single reason for it being there or how it was created. It's just sort of there and that's it, we have to accept it. The acting is uniformly bad, Andrews has to be one of the most bland and uninteresting leading men ever! You can barely understand what Macht is saying because of his ridiculous accent. This film apparently cost $10,500,000! Where did all the money go? I bet the executives at Paramount had heart attacks when they saw what their money had brought! There's not even that much gore in it, a chopped off foot, a man with no hand and a couple of shots of blood splattering over walls and furniture, and that's it. No nudity either I'm afraid. The monster is never really completely seen, just shots of it's head, claws, tail and wings although I thought the effects looked alright. A real wasted opportunity, this film adds nothing new to the horror genre and is pretty poor. Definiteatly one to avoid.

The biggest issues against this one is the fact that way too much time is spent here on the utterly useless subplot about the different workers at the plant, none of which do anything interesting overall or move the film along at all. The fact that this one tends to continually bring up the different affairs and inter-office dramas within everyone here really has the effect of slowing down the film so that it really drags through the first half. As well, there's just nothing all that interesting or exciting about all of these particular tangents which are just plain irritating as this makes it really hard to really matter what happens to them and how they tend to the various situations around here are. The better elements, here, though, do manage to counteract the flaws here as there's some rather decent efforts throughout this. There's a rather interesting series of attacks throughout which is quite entertaining at times as the encounters in the mill are highly enjoyable. The first encounter within the bowels of the factory works pretty well due to the claustrophobic setting and intense heat, the recovery team getting assaulted in the sewers underneath the mill are quite fun as the different surrounding get utilized to help with the rampaging assault on the crew, as well as the rather chilling encounter within the cemetery crypt which provides this one with plenty of opportunities to get rather enjoyable and entertaining. The best part, though, is the finale down deep in the underground shaft atop a pile of bones as the fight there includes a huge, mutated monstrosity that perfectly echoes the Gothic sensibility of the setting down there by placing such a creature in that situation to make the chilling encounter all the better. By plaguing all of this alongside the great special effects for the giant rat alongside the dead bodies floating around, this adds another level here to what works and really helps to sell the goo parts about this one.Rated R Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.

The problem starts when various employees go missing and it appears there's some sort of giant rat offing them. GRAVEYARD SHIFT has a few memorable moments but in the end it's a pretty laughable film but it's hard to really blame anyone other than the producers for giving this a green light. I'm not sure how good or bad the short story was but it's clear that it shouldn't have been turned into a feature. The entire idea of a giant rat killing people just isn't very scary and when you're doing a horror film that can't possibly get any scary moments then you're already playing behind the eight ball. Another problem is that there's just not too much going on here. A new guy (David Andrews) gets picked on by co-workers. Someone gets killed by a monster. The new guy starts to fall for a co-worker (Kelly Wolf). Someone gets killed by a monster. The jerk owner (Stephen Macht) picks on someone. Someone gets killed. There's really nothing for the viewer to do except wait for the next kill and wait for the next person to get picked on. The kills are somewhat memorable simply because how often to giant rats kill people? The rat creature (or whatever it is) looks rather silly and perhaps this is why they don't show it too much. I will say that the death scenes are quite graphic and bloody, which is somewhat shocking considering what the MPAA was doing to horror films in this era. The performances are all rather good with the exception of Brad Dourif who plays an exterminator. Whoever decided to have this character do comedy relief certainly didn't have the actors best interest in mind.

After watching it for the first time, I didn't think it was as bad as it reputation lets on but I wasn't wowed over by it either. Quite a lumbering, by-the-numbers and threadbare creature on the rampage outing.An isolated small town community sees its business mainly arrive from their local textile mill. This is re-opened, after an accident saw someone die. A team of workers are hired to work in it and also clean it up as the decayed structure is a home to a horde of rats. However that's the least of their problems as there's something much bigger and hungrier shacked up in the mill's cellar.The makeshift story is rather daft, nothing is truly explained and the set-pieces are only there to set-up the cheap, dreary shocks which are plastered throughout. There's a real nastiness within. Some moody atmospherics from its gloomily dirty windmill setting with a neighbouring graveyard (despite some stagy direction), along with a colourfully intense support role by Brad Dourif as a rodent exterminator make it worth a gander. David Andrews is in the lead and draws up very little, while Stephen Macht overdoes it. Kelly Wolf is half-decent and Andrew Divoff shows up in minor support. The f/x work is modest for it low-budget, so is the creature design; something of a bat cross rat hybrid.

Well, it's supposed to be.The films plods along until Andrews and a bunch of unpleasant co workers, along with Stephen Macht and his demented accent, get down to the business of trying to clear the basements up, and then there is much screaming and running. The monster effects themselves aren't too bad; but the film sticks with gore rather than trying to go for any real scares. It's difficult to say this is offensive to the source material; rather than wasting potential, the film has stretched the original story way too much; its reasonably chilling seven or eight pages were good in themselves, but hardly effective material to make an 80 minute film.That said, there are plus points from trying to place Macht's accent, and Brad Dourif's wonderful turn as The Exterminator. There is at least a vague suggestion of some suspense as the clean up crew go from basement to basement; and the gore and effects are maybe enough to please anyone in the mood for undemanding horror. Certainly, if you can switch your brain to the right setting to enjoy Maximum Overdrive, this one shouldn't disappoint. However, it's doomed to stay hidden in the abyss of 80s and early 90s trash horror. Certainly not good, but not bad enough to stand out either.

Dwelling a little more on the human element and why the townspeople behave as they do toward the new mill worker (a drifter with a college ed), would have helped. Unfortunately, the script doesn't give any of the actors a chance to develop credible characters.Nevertheless, loopholes and all (inconsistent motivations for the things certain characters do), GRAVEYARD SHIFT manages to serve viewers a fair share of unexpected twists and turns in the course of a typical King tale of terrorized victims which just happens to take place in his favorite domain, Maine. None of the performers are well-known (which can be a good thing), except for Brad Dourif who is hilariously over-the-top as The Exterminator. It doesn't help that the female lead is particularly unappealing.What helps considerably are the able performances of David Andrews and his uneasy relationship with boss Stephen Macht, heavy on the Maine accent. Macht has the perfect face for sneering villainy. Andrews' predicament as the new mills worker is what kept me wanting to see how things turned out. The rat-filled prologue should have warned me of things to come, but even a dedicated horror fan should get some unexpected jolts from the last half-hour.Not a great horror film, but one with the atmosphere down perfectly. You can almost smell the stench of Andrews' surroundings and the sweat on his back as he makes the most of a gruesome situation. I understand the new DVD version is an excellent transfer that makes the most of the gritty atmosphere.Definitely not for those who can't stand the sight of the nasty little critters.

All of those make Graveyard Shift a memorable guilty pleasure.Based on Stephen King's short story and set in Maine,Graveyard Shift tells the story of a drifter named John Hall(David Andrews)who's just arrived in Maine looking for a fresh start and a job. John eventually finds a job at a textile mill working for Warwick(Stephen Macht),the mill's sadistic boss and working from 1100 p.m to 700 a.m--the Graveyard Shift. But,at the Mill the place is infested with Rats and John and his co-workers are being stalked by a huge killer bat. Now,John and his co-workers have to worry about getting a good paycheck and survival.Stephen King despite being one of the greatest and most iconic bestselling Authors of all-time the film adaptations of his work have been a mix bag because the truth is for every great and strong Stephen King adaptations like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining(1980),Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption(1994),and Brian De Palma's Carrie there is always a weak adaptation like Graveyard Shift. Even though it's not one of the best Stephen King films I always watch the movie when it's on television because there are some good things about it and it's entertaining and memorable. One of the things that I like about Graveyard Shift is the film's atmosphere which is dark and mysterious giving the movie a sense of doom and dread giving you the feeling that nothing is going to be alright in the end. Where most Horror films made now are pretty and glossy,GS is neither pretty or glossy,but ugly and dirty being true to the working class feel that the main characters represent. The heat and sweat also play a big part in GS because with the heat and sweat you feel like you are with the characters working with them and getting dirty in the textile mill and the heat just comes off the screen when you watch it. The killer bat(or rat bat)is good villain for film because what makes the bat so effective is that we the viewers only catch glimpses of the creature whether it's the bat's eyes,wings or mouth and we never see the Bat in it's full form until the very end which makes the creature in the film more effective. The blood and gore in Graveyard Shift is disgusting and not for the weak at heart,but will satisfy Horror fans and gore hounds. While there are things I like about the movie there is also problems with the film. GS has a great atmosphere but lacks the scares and suspense to back it up because with a movie like this GS should be a scary and creepy but the scares never come. Being that Graveyard Shift was based on a 15-page short story and the running time is 89 minutes GS feels too short and seems like there should have been much more in the film. And at the same time GS feels too long giving the film a few scenes there are necessary and some scenes that are unnecessary. At times GS almost seems like if they cut 30 or 40 minutes out of the film that it would've been better if were apart of Anthology films like George A. Romero's Creepshow and Twilight ZoneThe Movie rather than it's own film. While some of the main characters like John Hall,Warwick,Tucker Cleveland(Brad Dourif)and Jane(Kelly Wolf)are interesting the rest of the main characters are thinning written and forgettable to the point where you don't care about what happens to them. The final 30 minutes of Graveyard Shift are wonderful and is filled with non-stop thrills and moments of blood and gore. A fantastic conclusion.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. David Andrews is wonderful as John Hall,with Andrews bringing intensity and depth to the role. Kelly Wolf is terrific as Jane,a female co-worker of Hall. Stephen Macht is excellent and over the top as Warrick,with Macht doing a great Maine accent. Brad Dourif is brilliant and at his best as Tucker Cleveland,an exterminator of rats. Andrew Divoff(Danson),Vic Polizos(Brogan),Robert Alan Beuth(Ippeston),Ilona Margolis(Nordello),Jimmy Woodard(Carmichael),Jonathan Emerson(Jason Reed),Minor Rootes(Stevenson)and Kelly L. Goodman(Warrick's Secretary)give good performances as well.The direction by Ralph Singleton is good,with Singleton bringing a dark and gritty atmosphere to the film. Fine direction,Singleton.The score by Brian Banks and Anthony Marinelli is effective,moody and adds to the films tone and I loved the theme song that plays during the end credits. Good score and theme by Banks and Marinelli. The film also has a few songs on the soundtrack by The Beach Boys(Surfin' Safari),The Charlie Daniels Band(Bad Boys,Joanna,Honky Tonk Dreams),The Metropolitians(Blue Hour)and Scott Reader(They're Gone).The special make-up effects are great,realistic and well-done when used. Terrific special effects.In final word,if you love Stephen King,Horror Films or Monster movies,I suggest you see Graveyard Shift,a film that is one of the weakest Stephen King movie adaptations,but is still an entertaining Horror Film that is watchable. Recommended. 6.5/10.

Dourif really does steal the show, as he so often is known to do... not sure how this guy is not a bigger name among the mainstream and not more or less considered a fringe actor.The film received poor reviews from critics, and it currently (December 2012) holds a 13% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 4.3 on IMDb. The tomato rating is much too low, and the IMDb one is still a bit low. I maybe be a bit generous with my rating, but I really do not see this being below a 5.

What distinguishes it is its commitment to looking as grungy and unappealing as possible. In fact, it may be the grimiest genre film since C.H.U.D., which also took place underground. King's grisly and ghoulish tale tells of the crew of a textile mill in a small town. The mill is infested - yeah, that's the understatement of the year - with rats, and periodically the employees disappear. As it turns out, there's something in the bowels of the mill that's much bigger and uglier than any ordinary rat. Atmosphere and set decoration are pretty strong here; horror fans will dig a particular chamber that's just stocked full of human bones. There's a sufficient amount of gore and very crude yet undeniably entertaining creature effects. David Andrews is a good looking but rather bland hero, but Kelly Wolf is cute and endearing as his feisty leading lady. It's very cool to see a pre-stardom Andrew Divoff (Wishmaster) as one of two bullies; Vic Polizos plays the other (and *he* was actually *in* C.H.U.D.!). The cast members that really make watching this thing worthwhile are Stephen Macht and Brad Dourif. Macht hams it up something fierce, speaking in an exaggerated Maine accent that's so hilarious one may crack up every time he utters a line. He's a mighty fine white trash villain; perhaps his best moment in the movie is when he goes completely bonkers, rubbing the dirt from an old bottle on his face as if he's going to war. And Dourif, as a mangy exterminator, delivers a performance that's really way too good for this sort of thing; he even manages to shed a tear during a riveting monologue wherein he explains the Viet Cong's use of rats as torture devices during 'Nam. One of his best lines has him firmly state that he's not the kind of veteran one would see Bruce Dern playing on film! The direction is by Ralph Singleton, in his sole feature film directing credit; he's usually been a producer, assistant or second unit director, or production manager. He makes this a pretty clunky affair that's still a hoot in all of its tacky glory. There's certainly much more prestigious Stephen King cinema than this, but there's still a respectable amount of entertainment value to be found here. That extends to the choice of music for the end credits, a decidedly non funky beat over which dialogue from the movie is played. Six out of 10.

Ralph Singleton has been second unit director on many high profile films but he cannot manage to build suspense, frights or much more than what feels like a sluggish misguided attempt that is as bad as the muck in the basement of the mill.

Unfortunately for the workers, dust and cobwebs aren't their only foe, as the place is absolutely over-run with rats. However, these aren't your ordinary vermin, as the workers soon find out. One by one, in predictable fashion, they find themselves being picked off and forced to face an unbelievable horror.One of King's more middle-of-the-road adaptations, Graveyard Shift gets by with ample suspense and atmosphere, in spite of its dreadful (not in a good way) pace. Director Ralph S. Singleton does a good job of capturing the cramped feeling of the story's setting on film, as you can almost see and feel a layer of grease and sweat on the screen itself. The acting ranges from bland to over-the-top, with Brad Dourif taking the cake as The Exterminator. An intense Vietnam vet with an axe to grind against the rats, Dourif single-handedly steals each and every scene he appears in. It's almost a shame that a character invented strictly for the film adaptation turns out to be its best feature, though.When compared to some of King's more tepid adaptations, Graveyard Shift is actually a rather competent and effective little horror film, if not a bit forgettable. It takes a while to get to its point, and by the end, we are left with a payoff that doesn't quite match the build-up. It's at least worth seeing for horror fans seeking some decent creature effects, colorful characters and cramped conditions.

My mother can hear the TV upstairs when she is asleep, but I managed to watch this without her hearing anything, in the dark at around one in the morning. It really helped the atmosphere. This movie has a bleak atmosphere, one that is truly evil. The fact that the exposure this film gets in the horror genre is practically nil, it really surprised me. When watched late at night, it certainly sends a chill down your spine &#150; some truly horrible scenes are in this. Take the scene where the mans head gets crushed by a coffin outside in the pouring rain, in the mud, his head gets crushed into rock, mixing blood with mud, then all you hear is the eerie silence and the pouring of rain. This scene is really eerie, and sent chills right down my spine. This film isn't brilliant, but it's certainly one of the only Stephen King films that managed to make me feel slightly unsettled. The only other moment in a King film that had me shocked was when you saw someone getting shot through the back, with blood spraying out the other side in Misery. It was a true `Where did that come from' moment! The acting is average, and the special effects are as good as they need to be. The ending is somewhat uninspired. Overall, a good `watch late at night in the dark' movie.

Graveyard Shift is another film culled from the book of short stories Night Shift.  King's short tales are effective due to their immediacy and non-dependence on a happy ending.  Film adaptations usually fail on both counts.  To fill roughly ninety minutes extra scenes and characters are added thus losing the `gist' of the story.  The most extreme example is The Lawnmower Man.  Secondly most studios are reluctant to give their adaptation a downbeat ending, with anaemic results.  Witness the awful Children of the Corn.  Graveyard Shift is guilty on the first count, less so on the second.In Night Shift a group of workers are clearing out a disused workhouse.  One of them is a college student and receives a cold shoulder from the blue-collar workers.  However, any animosity is forgotten when they disturb a nest of hungry rats.  Munch, munch.  This would only fill a half-hour section of a portmanteau film, e.g. Cat's Eye or Creepshow.  So the filmmakers pad it out with a slew of cliched characters and situations.  The college boy remains (albeit slightly older), but add the sinister, greedy boss, the unfriendly and dim-witted yokels (one of which has seen too many Rambo films i.e. three), a female romantic interest, and the token black character.*spoilers*Brad Dourif appears as an oddball rat exterminator similar to John Goodman's character in Arachnophobia which was made about the same time.  Dourif's role seems extraneous to the plot and is just an excuse for overacting.  He exits the film with a crushing headache similar to his comeuppance in Trauma three years later.Alas the rats don't do the killing.  A giant rat with bat-like wings does (why does it have wings it never flies?). The presence of this monster and its connection with the rats is unexplained, perhaps to the films advantage.  It would doubtless be some radiation or chemical waste tedium. The film would have been better if they had dropped the monster altogether and stuck with killer rats cf. The Abominable Dr. Phibes or a James Herbert novel.  `Everyday' creatures can be more effective screen monsters than fantastic creations (careful with the editing and animal rights though).Towards the end the film veers into the realms of fantasy with labyrinthe tunnels and bone-filled rooms.  There is a striking sequence with the two `heroes' wading shoulder deep in red hued water, through a narrow passage using a coffin for buoyancy.  It is the most unique image in the film.The best character is the factory manager with his strange dialect and questionable motives.  Notice how he suddenly appears when you expect the monster to.  I considered that they might be the same entity, some shapeshifting creature.  He is the perfect counter foil to the beast and they should have died together.  But I suppose the college graduate had to do something at the end.

It will never change anybody's life or be mentioned on any top one-hundred lists. But it's easier to find flaws in a little horror film than to 'mine' it for good points as so many have failed to do.Adapting a short (very short) story from Stephen King's collection Night Shift, Ralph Singleton took a small budget, unique sets, and a remarkably gifted group of actors and spun a film called Graveyard Shift.Plot A group of over-worked misfits in a textile mill run afoul of a strange, mutant creature and a large number of rats. Simple, huh? The film has a very dodgy quality as it suffers from budget restraints, unreliable accents, and an uneven pace. Stephen Macht is divinely evil (if that makes sense) as the unscrupulous Warwick, who runs the mill like his own demented clubhouse. Macht's performance is over the top as his accent wavers at certain times and his mania takes over but somehow it seems to fit in this guilty pleasure.But it's hard working character actor Brad Dourif who walks away with this picture slung over his shoulder as he portrays an intense exterminator with an unnatural hatred for rodents. His screen time is limited but, as in Exorcist III, Dourif fills it with charisma. The rest of the cast is quite good as well including the likable David Andrews, the sweet Kelly Wolf, the slimy Vic Polizos, and the underrated Andrew Divoff playing a bit of a jerk (go figure).It would be easy to kick the movie while it's down, as critics and audiences do quite often.

Though in the story you never find out why.  In this extra place all this strange creatures are there and the only weapon the main character and the boss have is a super powered hose.  The boss tries to run out and the main character hits him with a stream from the hose, the boss is dead and then the main character gets it...the end.  A few similarities between the two, but they added actually more depth to the story.  There is a reason why everyone hates the boss in this one and there is more to it than just a sub-basement.  There is a whole cavern below the foundry where they work.  There are no longer a bunch of mutant creatures, rather there is only one strange beast lurking beneath the place.  Though they do keep the part about them working an extra day and that is when they find the underground.  I thought this one was okay, it could have explained what the caves were better and the guy playing the boss goes over the top later in the movie, but I still enjoyed it a bit.

Every scene is as interesting as it is biting into a stale piece of bread. Near the end, there's a big a struggle in a pile of bones and a woman is killed senselessly. I had such a thoroughly unpleasant experience at this film. What I found most disturbing about this movie is that people paid good money to see it. This is NOT an exaggeration! This film is THAT bad.Wanna know just how bad this film is? Before it started, they showed a trailer for another Stephen King film, Misery. I enjoyed that short trailer much more than Graveyard Shift. Heck, I would have rather watched the Misery trailer over and over for the same length of time as this disaster, and would have enjoyed myself immensely. DO NOT, under any circumstances, see Graveyard Shift.

Basically it's about huge, killer rats.  This one is about one huge killer rat (with wings no less).  The story is dull, ALL the actors sucked (only Brad Dourif went on to any type of a movie career after this) and the monster looked as fake as it was.  I caught this little fiasco at a first run theatre back in 1990.  The place was crawling with high-school kids (despite the R rating).  They were quiet at the beginning but then they started to get restless and yell things and/or laugh at the screen.  When the monster was seen in full view the entire audience exploded with laughter.  Mind you, these are 14 and 15 year olds!An absolute waste of time and money.  A definite one to avoid.  Read the King short story--you'll be much better off. "}]
