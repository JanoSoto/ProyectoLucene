","Date":"30 August 2005","Score":"114 out of 153 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Suspiria has been acclaimed as director Dario Argento's masterpiece. And it certainly is. The plot is fairly simple. American ballet student Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) travels to Germany to attend an exclusive ballet school. Once there, she discovers that there is more going on within than just dance instruction. Although the school's directress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) welcomes her warmly, she is unsettled by her aide, Nazified teacher Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), as well as several mysterious student disappearances. When her new friend Sara (Stefania Casini) is the latest to vanish, Susy begins her own investigation of the academy. Filmed in bright, lurid Technicolor, and accompanied by a thundering soundtrack by Goblin, Suspiria is a nightmare-come-to-life. The performances of Harper, Bennett and especially Valli (like Bennett, a major star of the Golden Age) are solid, as is the unrelentingly creepy atmosphere. Also on display are two especially gruesome murders which happen near the beginning of the film. Argento later said that he modeled the look of the film directly on Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and, indeed the similarities are apparent. Suspiria may not always make perfect sense plot wise, but it's a thrilling roller-coaster ride through what may very well be Hell. Suspiria ranks as one of the best Italian-made horror films of all time.

In a style where sudden visual shocks are used to thrill the audience, Argento creates elaborate deaths which cannot be quickly forgotten.  The highly involved double-murder towards the beginning of the film still remains one of the most memorable scenes in horror history, standing next to the Psycho shower scene in pure sensory input. And in a technique so powefully employed here and here alone, Argento sets scene after scene aglow with color, using it to express the mood in ways only the subconscious can fully appreciate.  All around, this is an excellent addition to the genre of horror cinema, one of the most expressive films to ever plunge a knife into the psyche of its viewers.

This is a gem to look at with all it's lush Italian colors seeping out like a blood covered canvas. If you are looking for a horror film for intellectuals, this isn't it, but if you want something that will definitely impress you, you've found it. It concerns an old dance company in Freiburg Germany that is headed up by an old witch matriarch who leads the coven in diabolical methods. An unsuspecting student, played wonderfully by Jessica Harper, finds herself piecing together a mystery when she arrives at the school in one of the most enigmatic and beautiful commencements of a film to date. Argento has music, colors, and sounds reverberate like an opera for our eyes to dazzle. He scares us with the rain, the closing of an automatic airport door, and loose tree branches that resemble evil lurking beings. This is one powerful moment. From then on, subtle hints are explored, the supernatural, science, one's faith. Never can we guess what is truly hiding at the academy. One scene of the dance students in the hall is superbly done with loud music, hideous heckling demonic shrieks and strange appearances, this is fantastic eye candy!

Suspiria is a visually stunning film.The images contain objects we recognize, like people, buildings, and interior decor.  But the objects seem vaguely menacing, and less real than surreal, as though they symbolize ideas, repressed desires, or subconscious fears.  The vivid, rich colors, strange camera angles, deep shadows, and bright light piercing through darkness, all contribute to the impression that the viewer is trapped in someone else's nightmare.One haunting segment of the film takes place in a huge, and strangely empty, public square, at night.  A blind man and his German shepherd dog stand in the middle of the square, surrounded by imposing buildings of neo-classical architectural style.  Some professional reviewers of this film have suggested that the public square is a veiled reference to Hitler and Nazism.  Indeed, one could argue that the film's subtext is an indictment of fascism.Suspiria is not for everyone.  It is unsettling, and at times grisly.  The plot is weak, and plot elements are not really explained.  The acting is largely irrelevant.  And while the background music is suitably gothic, it is also frantic and monotonous.The best approach to this art-house film is to ignore the superficial plot, and focus instead on the fabulous cinematography, and the gothic images as conceptual metaphors.

The music score by Goblin is one of the most effective score ever to grace a horror movie.The story concerns an American ballet student who discovers that a coven of witches run the school as bodies begin piling up. Not much of a story here, but that's really not the main thing. Style and atmosphere is the main course here, and it's execution is completely flawless. Acting and dubbing are okay and the dialogue is a bit stiff.

It turns out its run by a witches coven and they'll kill anybody who threatens them...That's about it for plot. There IS a plot but it jumps all over the place...but it doesn't matter. This movie is fascinating just to look at and hear it. The settings are truly bizarre and done in eye-popping color. They're complimented by the excellent use of color and lighting. Also the group Goblin contributes to it a downright terrifying and LOUD score which really starts to work on you. The murder scenes are graphic--VERY graphic. The opening double murder is shocking and bloody. There are many great sequences that you just look at in wonder HOW this was done. My favorite is when Sarah (Stefania Casini) is being stalked through the academy late at night by an unseen evil force.Director Dario Argento has made a true masterpiece of horror. Its short on plot but the visuals and music more than make up for any of its drawbacks. The acting is good--especially by Joan Bennett (obviously enjoying herself) and Alida Valli who just LOOKS scary...especially those teeth of hers. Harper is also very good considering she was acting opposite people who didn't speak English! The poor dubbing is a little distracting but this is still a horror masterpiece. A must-see.

The colors in Suspiria(1977) gives it an artful flavor that makes the movie beautiful to watch.  Argento uses the colors of blue, green, red, and yellow in an unique manner.  The director uses the old technicolor technique that was in use during the 1950s.  This aspect gives the movie a fairy tale appearence.In the first 20 minutes, Dario Argento wanted to build up suspense and tension that was normally reserved for the climax of a film.  The main character and story are built up in good fashion.  The shoots of Suzy Bannion inside the taxi cab gives the viewer a feeling of claustrophobia and dread.  The image and music in the opening moments add high voltage suspense to the film's pounding intensity level.  The shots through the woods are fabulously done.The double murder sequence is one of the most bloody scenes in modern horror films.  It still retains its shock value after twenty four years. This one sequence makes any murder scene in a teen horror film today look tame. The only murder sequence from an Argento film to match this in its brutality is the arm removal scene in Tenebre(1982).  The murder of the first victim is extremely violent and yet stylishly filmed.Dario Argento owes his debt in making Suspiria to the early animations of Walt Disney and the art of Jean Cocteau.  The main source of influence is the Disney film of Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs.  The Snow White film would influence many Italian horror movie makers because of the impression it made on them as a child.  The story of Suspiria(1977) was to originally take place in a children's school.  This was changed because of the possible controversies this would cause in the film community of Italy.In filming the murder scenes, the director wanted to pump them with intense horror that wouldn't let up.  He wanted to create scenes of fear that would be carried by its gory visuals and ear pounding music.  The murder scenes in the motion picture are given their own personal style. On doing this film and these murder scenes, Argento has said(Fear is a 370 degree centigrade body temperature.  With Suspiria I wanted 400 degrees).  The murder sequences are one of the main things that make the film a gem of a horror movie.Suspiria(1977) adds some movie lore to witchcraft mythology.  The movie looks at the mythology of witches and witchcraft with keen interest.  Its one of the best films on the subject of witches.  Argento was fascinated by the subject of witches and used that fascination to make Suspiria(1977). Another source of influence is a section from the Thomas De Quincey's drug induced fantasy essay, Confessions of an Opium Eater called Suspiria De Profundis.Daria Nicolodi gives an important contribution in co writing the screenplay. Suspiria is the only film where Daria Nicolodi had creative imput on an Argento flick.  Part of the film was inspired by Nicolodi telling Argento about her Grandmother's experiences at a finishing school where black magic was practriced during the late hours of the night.  Daria Nicolodi was to play Sara, Suzy's friend but got injured during shooting.  The story is there to give structure to the visuals & music.The death of Daniel, the blind piano player is set up with suspense.  The scene takes an unexpected turn when he is attacked by his own dog.  This is because the scene at its opening points to him being killed by a witch. Dario Argento along with cameraman Luciano Tovoli uses complex camera movement to make this scene work.  This scene must have impressed Lucio Fulci when he saw the film that he would play homage to it in The Beyond(1981).There has been a great debate among Argento fans on whether Deep Red(1975) or Suspiria(1977) is the director's masterpiece.  Some see Suspiria(1977) as the masterpiece in the film cannon of Dario Argento.  Others regard Deep Red(1975) as his true masterpiece.  In my opinion, Tenebre(1982) is the masterpiece of Dario Argento because its complete in motifs that were seen in his films up to that point.  Deep Red(1975) and Suspiria(1977) are Argento's top horror films of the 1970s.I find it intriging that Suzy and Sara resemble sisters and have names that begin with the letter S.  Suspiria was influenced by an obscure horror pic called La Residencia/The Finishing School(1968).  Supiria contains a tinge of the giallo genre with a scene in the opening moments.  The Goblin gives out another amazing soundtrack following their excellent score for Profondo Rosso.  Luciano Tovoli does a fantastic job as the cinematographer in showcasing the nightmarish world of Suspiria(1977).

It is not a perfect film, but it comes closer than any other film in the genre. Everything until the last few minutes is masterfully orchestrated, combining skillful direction with chilling cinematography, not to mention a score that ties my stomach into knots every time I hear so much as a snip of its odd techno-funk beat. Unfortunately, the voice of the witch at the end turns masterful horror into overriding cheese, making the tagline ring all too true there is *nothing* more terrifying on film than the first ninety minutes, but the last few fall somewhat short of genius.That fact notwithstanding, *Suspiria* is a fine example of how horror movies should be made, and I sincerely hope that any director or screenwriter contemplating a horror film first sits down to watch this one so they can be reminded that the horror genre properly contains a good deal more than the simple-minded slasher flick that has become all-too-typical in American theaters. After all, no less a filmmaker than Wes Craven seems to have followed this advice, and it allowed him to move from such pitiful efforts as *A Nightmare on Elm Street* to *Scream*, the first (and thus far only) classic horror film of the 90's.

She chose the celebrated academy of Freeborge. One day, at nine in the morning, she left Kennedy airport, New York, and arrived in Germany at 1040 p.m. local time. Those are the opening lines of Suspiria, as spoken by the narrator. Those lines are the beginning of a must see experience for all horror fans... period.Dario Argento has to be one of the most talented directors in Italian film history. He was influenced by some of the greatest directors in cinema including Alfred Hitchcock. Dario Argento did it all with Suspria. Suspria breaks all the barriers. Not only is it completely nightmarish and bazaar, but it uses different colors of light in a brilliant, chilling way. Suspiria has some of the most memorable scenes in history, whether it be the first shocking murder, the dog biting the man's neck, or the very good ending which will have your eyes glued to the screen. One of the most nightmarish aspects of Suspiria is the over-the-top creepy music that it offers. When Goblin performs music for a movie, that should be instant indication that the movie will be very tense experience. The tension and suspense in Suspiria is built up by the music.Gore hounds will not be disappointed by Suspiria. Keep in mind, I said won't be disappointed not be impressed. Suspiria has enough gore to be realalistic, but not enough to impress. However, people who watch Suspiria shouldn't watch it for the gore, they should watch it for the haunting atmosphere and tension.Suspiria was shot in Italy, therefore, if you are watching the movie in an English language you will find that it is dubbed. This may very well be the only reason I found the dialoge in Suspiria to be fairly average. The dubbed audio didn't fit very well, but it isn't beyond terrible.The only con of Suspiria is the fact that it seems to be dragged out. However, this hardly hurts the film in anyway, and is almost unnoticeable to first time viewers. The first time I viewed Suspiria will be a experience I will not forget.I highly recommend Suspiria to every euro-horror fan out there. It is very nightmarish, creepy, suspenseful, nightmarish, terrifying...

If anything, Dario Argento art directs this movie within an inch of its life, to a point where it actually succeeds to separate itself from its horror roots and begins to open itself to a perverse fairy tale. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are one of the most tense moments of mounting horror I have seen in a while (despite the horrible dialogue and the bad dubbing, courtesy of what seems to be the norm of Italian movies of the period). Its setup, consisting of Jessica Harper's character, Susie Bannion, arriving at the school of dance that she is to attend in the middle of a storm. (Why she doesn't take the storm as a signal that maybe this might not be the ideal place for her is anyone's guess.) A girl, Pat Hingle, runs out screaming into the night and winds up at the neighboring dorm where a friend takes her in, but soon later she meets a grisly fate in a fantastic sequence that has become a classic all its own.What's shocking is not the absolute terror that reaches this early pitch in SUSPIRIA (compressing the horror which happens in PSYCHO by half an hour and setting the stage to the events which follow even when in retrospect they make little sense) it's the way it's set up. Instead of going for dark, moody colors or the more modern technique of filtering a sickly green or sepia or blue color to enhance elements of dread, instead of utilizing a dark-ambient theme with the occasional crashing violin, Argento decides to flood the scene in an orgy of color, rapid editing, and its unsettling, feverish Goblin score reminiscent of Tubular Bells with more primeval howls and drums, which escalate until they're practically reverberating all over the film. This is stunning, beautiful horror, a fable gone to the extreme perverse, technique over substance taken to its maximum level. SUSPIRIA is, quite simply, one of the best horror films ever made, and despite its age, it does not show it and proves that the oldest tricks in the book still work perfectly well. Watch it and enjoy, for this is a masterpiece.

As girls from the school die off violently one by one, this rumor seems more and more plausible.Although only one Argento film is listed in the Internet Movie Database's Top 50 horror films (Deep Red), Suspiria is the one widely considered his classic. After seeing it, I'm not the least surprised (until now, I was only familiar with his new material -- Jennifer and Pelts). The rich colors of this film, the surreality of it and the moving soundtrack (with a theme more haunting than even Jaws). While the film is now dated, anyone who doesn't mind a film with lower picture quality should enjoy this movie.The tagline reads, The Only Thing More Terrifying Than The Last 12 Minutes Of This Film Are The First 92. I'm not really sure what that's supposed to mean -- they are implying the end is boring compared to the rest of the film? Actually, the whole movie is quite good. Some parts are slower, and there is a lot of character development, but this is by no means a bad thing. When the murders happen, they really happen -- with the first girl being dragged through a window, stabbed repeatedly, and then hung after she was already quite dead.Udo Kier makes a cameo here, though his part is much smaller than I would have liked (I barely was able to see his dazzling blue eyes). The lead actress (Jessica Harper, I think her name is) was amazing, but everyone else was just ordinary. Yet, this worked well... I wasn't distracted by stars and really got into the film itself.Seeing a Dario Argento film is especially pleasant after recently watching Lucio Fulci's City of the Living Dead. With all due respect to Fulci, the Italian horror master is Argento. Fulci drags, his film quality is atrocious, and although he loves gore as much as anyone, doesn't deliver the way Argento does. I really look forward to watching Argento's Inferno in the near future.I am recommending this film. You have gore, a good plot, a great soundtrack... and it's a classic you really ought to be familiar with if you're a horror fan. If you enjoyed Lucky McGee's recent film The Woods, I think you'll enjoy this. The movies are very different but have some similar central plot themes.

I snagged an issue of FANGORIA from a local bookstore and I was fascinated by the images shown in pictorial form in that magazine. I got pumped up. I searched for this movie, the most famous of Dario's films, and I was able to find an old copy on VHS. This was before it was released in any good form on DVD.I remember the first time I watched it being completely shocked by the first murder scene, where the girl is hung. Then, the camera pans down to the floor where another one was struck by falling glass through the mouth...I was hooked.The colors and the splendor with which Argento paints the picture that is the setting of Suspiria should be on every painter's palette. The way he uses lights is amazing, especially for the time of Suspiria's release.To call him the 'Italian Hitchcock' is a little misleading; Argento brings something totally different to the table than Alfred ever did he updated the shock factor. And, unlike so many disgusting films that come out nowadays, he managed to keep it beautiful at the same time. Suspiria is the perfect introduction to this legendary horror director.

Illogical and dreamlike, it's filmed in rich red, blue and green hues, and the elliptical story is punctuated with several extremely gory (if technically unconvincing) murders.Jessica Harper is ideal in her role of Susie Banyon, an American ballet student who arrives at a German academy just as a series of bizarre events are beginning to unfold. A student is murdered on the night Susie arrives, and Susie actually holds a few fleeting clues after her brief contact with the victim. Soon she is at odds with the weird instructors at the school, and a new friend named Sarah plants the idea that the school may harbor some supernatural forces. Sure enough, Susie comes to discover that the teachers at the academy are nothing less than a coven of malevolent witches, with one notoriously wicked witch as their leader.What works about Suspiria may not work for some viewers. There is no logical story here, just a series of events that provide a framework for the movie's sense of style. The opulent set design is great to look at, and Argento places his emphasis on the atmosphere, combining his color schemes with fancy camerwork and a really strange soundtrack. Some of the sets are Gothic, others have a weird sort of pop art quality. Rooms have windows in nonsensical places, one victim falls into an improbably-placed bushel of razor wire, another is stalked by the camera as it swoops down on him like a huge bird. Susie is wide-eyed as she moves through her strange adventure, which leads her to hidden doorways, secret rooms, and half-remembered fragments of words. It's not necessarily terrifying, but some of the murders may make you cringe, and you might get caught up in the otherworldly qualities of the movie.To the uninitiated, Suspiria will delight and/or annoy you with it's strangeness. For those familiar with the language of Argento, Suspiria represents some of his best work. His ideas are innovative here, even if the story is a little vague, and it's easy to appreciate the vision that he must have had while making this movie. Fans of scary movies might recognize the influence of Suspiria on other movies they've seen, and that's because no matter what you think of it, it's definitely unique.

With the freaky music score and visuals, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Unlike the slasher films where it's all about blood and body count, Suspiria captures the viewer with so much more.

Last week I finally got around to seeing his latest (and last in the Mothers series), Mother of Tears, and although it was still great, it did not have the same flair that Suspiria still has. Distinctly European, Suspiria opens as if it were a giallo (much like his previous films The Bird with the Crystal Plumage or Deep Red) - with a series of spectacular murders stages with an odd beauty. However, Argento switches from black-gloved human killers to supernatural forces and black magic. Unfortunately, American ballet student Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) has to discover this when she arrives in Germany to attend a prestigious dance academy.Suspiria carries with it many of Argento's trademarks, in particular, his relentless tracking shots are beautiful and often haunting. This is accompanied by long-time collaborators Goblin, who give us a chilling, almost overbearing score which suits the Gothic feel of the movie. The cinematography is typically amazing, with an abundance of birds-eye-view shots and views of large buildings. In particular, a scene where a blind pianist enters a large square surrounded by imposing buildings of neo-classical architectural style is scary as well as great to look at.Accompanying all this is a unique use of colours, especially bright red, green and blue. This use of lighting occurs at random and seemingly silly scenes, but in fact adds an enormous amount of atmosphere and gives a sense of mysticism to the story. On the story, for an Argento film it is quite good (to contradict what others have said). It may be simple, but it unfolds at an even and logical pace only to slightly falter with a rushed ending. Furthermore, the acting is nowhere near award worthy (except Harper, Udo Kier and Joan Bennett as a nasty witch) but in no way detracts from the quality. Lastly (but certainly not least) are the outrageous death scenes which have garnered a lot of attention. Primarily, the opening double murder sequence, in which a young girl is stabbed to death (exposing her heart) and proceeds to crash through a glass ceiling, which mutilates the her friend below her. Interestingly, there are only three more deaths in the film and they are spaced quite far apart. Of course, these are all explicit and involve a lot of blood.Suspiria stands out even among the best of its form for the sheer intensity of the experience of watching - and hearing - it. From beginning to end, this is a nightmarish, hallucinatory fairytale with grotesque murders, a blaring score and beautiful imagery. A true horror film and a huge achievement in cinema, Dario Argento's Suspiria is deserving of all its praise.5/5 "},{"Title":"Thats 90 minutes of life I'll never get back.","Date":"3 December 2006","Score":"20 out of 37 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Firstly, I would like to say that I love film, classic and contemporary from all over the world, Horror is possibly my favourite genre. Secondly, thanks to all the pretentious film buffs that have listed Suspiria in any top 100 list, I appreciate that this is your opinion but you are wrong. This movie comes close to one of the worst I have ever sat through, one with little or no redeeming features.Argento's much acclaimed use of colour is pointless and clumsy, the soundtrack distracts the viewer from any potential suspense and his choice of effects is poor at best. An example of this is the overly graphic stabbing scene, Hitchcock taught us years earlier that you don't need to show what the mind can create for itself. Also why even use the chubby bat prop when the mere suggestion of a bat would have been more frightening. The script is poor and the plot line thin, if this movie had used a sense of irony it would still be bad but could have been funny.In conclusion, I would advise any movie lover to avoid Suspiria as you would any Steven Seagal film, your time will be better spent elsewhere.Here are some alternative titles you should tryThe Shining - Stanley Kubrick 1980 The Vanishing - George Sluizer 1988Ringu - Hideo Nakata 1998 Psycho - Alfred Hitchcock 1960 Rosemary's Baby - Roman Polanski 1968That is all.

This is one of the most highly praised (if not THE most highly praised) European horror movie of all time. Whenever anyone asks, What horror movies are good? What should I see? this movie is invariably in the elitist list. Its use of light and color is, indeed, a true study of cinematic technique and style. So what?! The one good idea Argento had (the imagery) was simply not enough to cover for the total lack of script, acting talent, meaningful dialog, horrible direction of these actresses, and the downright cheese-filled all-out crap&#150;fest that is Suspira.SPOILERS ABOUNDIn the first death scene, the acting was the most puerile trash I've ever witnessed (and I've SEEN Killer Klowns from Outer Space). These girls did not die well, prettily, or with grace. In fact, they didn't die with talent, either. The death scenes were nothing but an indication to me that this should have been the death of the movie. There simply aren't words for how horribly these girls portrayed their parts. Honestly, if the red-head had actually fallen that far with a cord attached around her neck, the weight of her body would have popped her head off her neck, rather than the sloppy inane banality we were given.Inane banality actually sums up the entirety of this movie. I cannot believe how highly recommended this trite piece of garbage is in the horror field. This was actually much, MUCH worse than I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,which was a total waste of my time. A friend, who watched this garbage with me observed, You know, Fiend? Aside from no one being naked, this really reminds me of a porno. Okay, hence the exploitation feel of this film. I don't care. How could I possibly care? The atmosphere everyone raves about just came off as a really bad porn and nothing more. Nothing could have saved this film from Argento's lack of talent but a really good remake. Hopefully, they won't make the mistake of assuming that this was, in any way, to be considered artsy. The acting quality is nonexistent and the screen play should have been exorcised and then buried in about 7 tons of salt, if you ask me. Even the ballerinas were inept. I've seen better down at the local play house.Most of the players and the director being Italian is a far cry from making this art. European does not equate art. Sorry, but um...no. This is rubbish. Nothing but unadulterated crap. The effects are laughable and there was not one redeeming performance in this whole venture. All I've accomplished in watching this garbage is the wasting of 95-98 minutes. I should've taken a nap, instead. The time would have been put to much better use.The musical score sounded like something that a two-year-old crackhead relentlessly banged out on the kitchen pots and pans in an epileptic seizure to rival the mother of all epileptic fits. The sound effects were distracting rather than complementary; cutting in and out at the worst possible moments, and coming off like some irritating noise an eight year old was making in the back seat of the car to annoy his dork brother. Refuse to be one of those mindless sheep who follow the herd. Don't allow yourself to be dragged into the whole mindset that because it's Argento, it's genius. That's just NOT the case, as Suspira MORE than proves. This is the most dismally wretched act of cinematic micturition ever to be committed to film, and I've seen some real stinkers in my time. If you waste your time on seeing this so-called movie after reading this, you've no one to blame but yourself. It scarcely rates a 1.2/10 on the B scale. That does not register anywhere on the A scale, I assure you.the Fiend .

So I was really psyched to find it used on DVD one day. I bought it sight unseen and damnit if I didn't feel really ripped off.  It lacked dramatic tension, ambiance, and even the pop-up scares and gore that even mediocre horror has. Notice that even the positive reviews mentioned that it lacked in plot and didn't directly scare the viewer, but the visuals and atmosphere more than made up for that. In truth it's all bad. Many horror fans would agree that you can forgo an air-tight plot if other things keep the film moving, but Suspiria has very little going for it. And has anyone stopped to think that if Argento succeeded in creating a rich, haunting atmosphere, then why shouldn't the movie be scary?Even with an art house lens, it's amateurish. I give it points for good sets and costumes. Beyond that, many of the scenes are uninteresting (visually AND story-wise) and totally unrelated to each other, i.e it doesn't make sense and it's paced badly! Its witch mythology is nonsensical, and there is no story motivation. Why does a devious underground witches' coven open a dance school? And why do they ritualistically drug one oblivious dancer and not the others? What's the point of the maggots? Why is a shiny spoon supposed to be scary? Too many nagging questions. Somehow there is little action, story, or character development in the numerous scenes of this film. Suspiria takes itself way to seriously to get past these holes, or even make the movie fun or interesting. Plus, the chilling light effects are literally reminiscent of the comic book murder scenes in Creepshow (go Adrienne!). `Creative and unique' my ass! I found the camera work dull and lacking in intensity. Even cheesy, no-budget Evil Dead (which we all love of course) had creative/unusual cinematography. Suspiria's also not very gory (was that magenta Tempra paint?) which I can appreciate, except that the few killing scenes are just lame and go on too long. The meandering killers seem pretty bored and lackadaisical, actually making it seem unbelievable that the victims are so scared. Horror should be about intensity and passion, and Suspiria is all wrong.If you like creepiness with interesting shots/lighting with slow development and not too much blood, try Repulsion or even Alien.  There are a million creepier, more atmospheric, and more interesting films just in the sub genre of B-horror. Good old Night of the Living Dead! To recap story, pacing, and visuals are a bust and there isn't gore to hold the attention of splatter fans. I won't even mention the beloved soundtrack. Okay, I will. It was generally inappropriate for the scenes and the band regularly struck disruptive power chords, hissed and screeched when absolutely nothing was happening. Why?! I forced myself to watch it again the next day to prove that I hadn't wasted my money. I returned it that afternoon.

The Tanz Academy is fronted by elegant Joan Bennett (as Madame Blanc), with stern Alida Valli (Miss Tanner) well-suited, as head teacher. Chief among the young leotard set is Ms. Harper's relatively long-lived pal, lovely Stefania Casini (as Sara). As hair-raising events continue, Harper begins to suspect a coven of witches may have infested the dance Academy.The storytelling part of Suspiria is relatively weak, with events unintentionally serving to lesson the dramatic impact of the horror. The superb opening scenes, for example, are never really improved upon. Interesting characters are underdeveloped, and should have been more cleverly woven into the plot. Despite its haphazard script, and some obvious budget restraints, director Dario Argento's Suspiria remains an excellent film.Mr. Argento's innovative, imaginative direction is the film's greatest strength. His cutting edge camera sense is often striking; and, the color photography, with Luciano Tovoli, is illuminating. The sharp soundtrack music, by the appropriately named Goblin band, is reminiscent of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells. Ms. Bennett and Ms. Valli are a treat. The usually underutilized Bennett is especially noteworthy, in her only post-Dark Shadows feature film appearance.Bennett accepted the project on the strength of the director's reputation, and a chance to visit Rome. When Suspiria appeared in the USA, she received some unwarranted poor notices, and professed dissatisfaction with the film's violent content. Still, Bennett was Saturn Award-nominated as 1978's Best Supporting Actress for her work. Bennett duplicitously gives the Madame Blanc character just the right amount of respectability, or class; she keeps her Academy dancers enrolled, and helps hold the slim story together.******* Suspiria (1977) Dario Argento ~ Jessica Harper, Joan Bennett, Alida Valli "},{"Title":"If you love horror films and haven't seen this, see it NOW!","Date":"12 November 2001","Score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  A lot has been written about Dario Argento's watershed horror film Suspiria.

I wasn't expecting the effects to be amazing of course, and I love lots of movies with bad effects, but this was so bad that I couldn't just try and not notice that they were bad, because it was impossible to miss.

What continues to work, however, is the look with which director Argento endows the film, particularly in regard to the set designs, camera set-ups, and use of color. Visually speaking, this is an amazingly beautiful film, with Art Nouveau designs, deceptively simple cinematography, and washes of intensely artificial color that dazzle with intensity. Even in the midst of its horrors it is almost impossible to take your eyes from the screen, such is its strange beauty.The cast is equally odd. Leads Jessica Harper and Stefania Casini are very typical of 1970s ingenues, but they each have a quality that sets them slightly apart from the young actresses of the time. Barbara Magnolfi makes an impression as Olga, one of the school's students, as does Susanna Javicoli as a harsh instructor. Even Udo Kier, cult star of Andy Warhol's FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula puts in an appearance. But oddest of all is Hollywood's Joan Bennett, who gives a truly flawless turn as the seemingly lady-like and ultra-respectable Madame Blanc.Less successful is the story itself, which is so slight as to be almost incidental. Young dancer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) has enrolled in a famous Italian ballet school--and upon her arrival finds another student fleeing the school in hysterics, a student who is not long after murdered in a horrifically brutal way. Odd incidents follow, and when Suzy's classmate and friend Sara (Stefania Casini) goes missing, Suzy begins to piece together the truth.Another flaw, at least to my mind, is the soundtrack. While it has been widely admired, I can think of few film soundtracks that are quite as heavy-handed in their dynamics as SUSPIRIA. That aside, and while the film has considerable creepiness, it isn't frightening per se. In the final analysis, this is a film which I think is best seen by cult connoisseurs--and even they are more likely to admire than to flatly like it.Gary F.

To her dismay, folks around her start dropping like flies and she eventually uncovers a spooky coven of witches. I must say that Suspiria is defiantly an acquired taste and is probably one of the most weirdest movies I have ever seen. Written by the brilliant Dario Argento who've brought such classics as Demons to our lives comes up with this fairy tale gone bad but shot beautifully, it's definitely one of those movies you'll never forget and the reason why I say it's an acquired taste is that not everyone gets this movie, because it's different, like I watched this movie with some of my friends and they thought it was to artsy and made no sense, but I definitely gets it. Also to add to this movie is the bloody and gory kills which are creative and suspenseful, the opening scene in particular is one of the movie's highlights, extremely brutal and you can really feel the pain as does the barbed wire scene which made me cringe along the flesh ripping, a silt throat, a stab in the neck and lots of bright red blood. I also appreciated the artistic flavor that Argento injected into his human slaughter via a use of bright red blood that looked more like finger paint than plasma. It worked for me.I think that Suspiria has stood the test of time over the years and even by todays standards it's still haunting yet mesmerising with plot turns and a real sense of mystery, a strong female lead and scary ass witches. It seems a pity that these days none of the horror movies that come out has this sense of style they all seem to be about the directer just spending loads of dosh on special effects and actors instead off perfecting a good story line.Jessica Harper (Suzy) was brilliant as the lead displaying strengh and vulnerability that made her outstanding, Stephani Casini (Sara) did fine as the lovable friend. Joan Bennet's (Madame Blanc) classy and somewhat cold presence gave the part the right type of feel. A young Udo Kier (Dr. Mandel) did OK with his small role. Alida Valli (Miss Tanner) gave a chilling performance.The directing and use of the colours clearly took my breath away and moved me and all the scenes such as the running in the woods while it's raining scene, the hallway magic spell scene scene, the red lighted curtain and of course the final scene were all classic a;ON with the haunting and moving music score.All in all just watch this movie it's a brilliant horror masterpiece which will hopefully will never get remade into some sub standard Hollywood tripe such as Psycho Remake and The Hitcher remake both were an insult to the memory of the original films. All that's left to say is that this movie's just simply brilliant and a true turning point in horror cinema and please nobody remake this masterpiece because that would be an insult.

It even has a few shocks that made me jump a bit and made my heart skip a beat. In one of the beginning scenes with Goblin's famous (or maybe notorious?) music, it builds up such an intense tension that my whole body got tense. I am in no way in bad shape, but I could feel my stomach aching a teeny, tiny bit after the movie. It was astonishing. It took me whole 15 minutes to get over the shock of the first 10 minutes of the movie. I mean, I have seen all of Dario Argento's thriller and horror movies from 1970 to 1990, I just didn't think he would start 'Suspiria' that way. Which is good! I understand that not everybody thinks 'Suspiria' is a horror masterpiece, some have called it noisy trash, some will say it's too slow, some complain about the lack of explanation to elements of the movie (like the maggots scene), some will also complain the script is bad since it doesn't spoon feed its audience with the answers. But that is how Argento makes movies, that is why I love his movies. He leaves certain things unexplained, which is great for a movie geek like me. I like to analyze and occupy my mind with movies I love, it helps me relax. But I gotta say, big names have mentioned 'Suspiria' as one of the all time greatest and one of the scariest horror movies ever made (For example John Carpenter and Alice Cooper).Anyway, the noisy soundtrack is supposed to unsettle its audience and not embrace them. It is supposed to psyche us out, make us tense and make us beg to make it stop. In my opinion, although with some quite simple music it is quite effective. I didn't expect to get that much tension from the movie and its music. Which was a horrifyingly awesome surprise. This is by the way an atmospheric horror movie, so don't expect slasher killings. This is like a child's nightmare, a fairy tale but for adults. By the way, the script is actually well-thought out unlike what many people might think. Argento spends a lot of energy writing his scripts, but he never really get recognition for that since many audience members call his scripts bad because he doesn't spoon feed his audience. Unlike many American and Blockbuster movies. That's what makes movies like 'Suspiria' great. It is not only a horror movie with a director who does what he wants, it is an Art-House horror movie with beautiful cinematography and beautiful colors and an operatic violence, that quite simply leaves me in awe. (Don't think that I enjoy violence, I am actually disgusted by it but my unhealthy fascination with it is bigger) Also it is like a fairy tale, but for adults. If you take away the grizzly murders, it does in some ways remind of 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', even some of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales. Which I absolutely love. It is a good way for me to stay away from mainstream, blockbuster movies which I don't find exciting. I give the movie 10/10 "},{"Title":"Tell me Suzy, do you know anything about witches...?","Date":"2 July 2015","Score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Suspiria is one of the undisputed classics of horror cinema, and certainly one of the very best horror movies ever to come out of Europe. Argento will probably always be a divisive figure. For all of his talents as a stylist, all of his movies (as much as I love them) are let down by tired pacing, ludicrous plots, hackneyed dialogue and pathetic characterisations. In short, if you're looking for cerebral, rather than purely visceral, look elsewhere.The main reason Suspiria was and still is able to stand out from the rest of Argento's oeuvre is that, for the first time, his focus was on the supernatural, rather than on some implausible and clumsily conceived murder mystery. The dialogue is still hammy and the characters &#x96; especially the woeful lead, Jessica Harper, who has about as much charisma as my grandmother's socks &#x96; are all pretty slender (pun intended), but the plot actually moves along well and the supernatural undercurrent gives Argento completely free reign to indulge his visualistic flair like never before (or since). Subtle it is not, but it sure is effective. The colour palette is gorgeous and the production design (note the height of the door handles) is eerily effective in setting the demented fairy-tale-gone-wrong tone. The death set pieces are among the best Argento devised (I cannot look at razor wire without wincing), their strength, as with all Argento deaths, being the fact that they're so connectible to the type of pain we can all imagine and we all dread. And, of course, there's the now-classic Goblin score which, however bombastically it is sometimes deployed, takes the tension up ten-fold.We can only hope that the long-circulated rumours of a remake remain unfounded.

It is the closest thing the movies have ever come to capturing a nightmare on the screen. With its blaring, screechy progressive rock soundtrack (courtesy of the spine chewing Goblins), overwhelmingly (and nauseatingly) Technicolor set design, and convoluted stalk-and-slashes, Suspiria is unlike anything the horror genre has ever offered, for better or worse. I cannot say watching the film is a particular enjoyable experience; but yet again, being scared is not something most seek out when they want to have a good time. Tell me were you ever really comfortable the first time you watched Halloween?I probably shouldn't be name-dropping Halloween willy-nilly; Suspiria is much more ambitious, and certainly much more excruciating to the eye. It's simultaneously offensive and luxurious to our sensitive pupils; the film drenches itself in the color palette of a Crayola based pop art painting, but the lack of realism in the atmosphere supplements its mystifying horror. As much as we attempt to throw our logic around in the visually combative mixture, it's impossible to truly understand what's really going on. There's something about witches and secret societies and Irises that lead to hidden hallways, but how can you focus on the plot when Dario Argento, bless his artfully messed-up heart, throws around red paint, rooms filled with barbed-wire, possessed German Shepherds, and maggot showers like its no big deal? Suspiria is comprised of the stuff your worst dreams are made of. It's not frightening in the traditional sense (i.e sitting at the edge of your seat, jumping when a cat is suddenly thrown at the camera). Imagine laying on your couch peacefully; you blink, and suddenly, you find yourself falling off a cliff. Just because something doesn't make sense doesn't mean it isn't terrifying.With the wide-eyed power of a final girl, Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American dancer staying in Europe after being accepted into a prestigious ballet school. Her arrival is anything but welcoming; she enters the country during an explosive thunderstorm, and, when at the entrance of the academy, is not greeted by a well-meaning headmistress but a trembling girl, mumbling something about irises and secrets like she's mouthing her very last words. Most would know something is afoot, especially considering that that very same girl dies a mind- numbingly grisly death later that night; but Suzy, excited by the opportunities in her horizon, doesn't let an unfortunate death get in her way. But one can only ignore murder for so long. Slowly but surely, students and staff who even think about questioning the strict teachers drop like gutted flies. Surrounding the deaths are even more bizarre events, coming in the forms of poisoned food, spiteful bats, and yes, even maggot showers. Soon, Suzy discovers that her school is not suffering from a case of eccentricity but rather something &#x85; supernatural, you might say.Horror directors are usually annoyingly bent out of shape when it comes to their movies. It's as if they feel bad for frightening us, offering an apology in the form of a long-winded explanation as to why all the crazy events we recently witnessed happened and why the villains are so damn villainous. But Suspiria is vague, putting our brains in a blender of hallucinogens and then pushing us out onto a busy street. Argento wants nothing more than to terrify us, and that's that. He's done his homework, fondling a fish-eye lens and a passion for claustrophobic camera angles. The film is both vast and inescapable the dance academy seems to be endless in its rooms, like a country of evil; but don't expect to stumble across an exit door anytime soon.When I say Suspiria is terrifying, I'm not putting it lightly. This is one of the scariest -and goriest - films to ever headline a mainstream cinema screen. It isn't any less shocking than it was 38 years ago, and, despite its pitiful dubbing, is awe-inspiringly aggressive. The colors slap you, and so does, well ... everything.

When this Halloween Extravaganza came up I took at as the opportunity to finally sit down the the film. I had only heard praises of the film. I personally wanted to go in cold. When a movie is hyped up I hate being let down. It has happened to me in a few of the last movie viewings. I stayed away from reviews and the like. I know that this movie has been out since '77 but I will do heavy research. Going in cold was the best idea I had with this film. Jessica Harper stars as Suzy Bannion a newcomer to a prestigious ballet school where some grisly murders have occurred. As Suzy gets accustomed to the life at the school she realizes that there is more than meets the eye with the school and it's employees. I know the movie has been out long enough for there to be no need for a spoiler alert. But I wouldn't want to spoil any of the story because there is a slight twist ending. It fits very well with the story as a whole. Argento has done an excellent job of drowning this film in dread. From the opening to the credits there is an unease that grows slowly. The vivid look of the film doesn't help that unease go away. The use of color is apparent. It's an odd choice but works very well. The film feels much darker than sometimes what's on screen. But when it gets violent it gets ugly. There are some inventive shots on display for a film like this. More so than many films in this genre, this film has style for a slasher. It makes sense coming from who it was made by and the time period it was release. The body count is low but when someone dies on screen the aftermath is gory. It brings even more to the dread of the film. You just have no idea how or who are going to get it. When they do, it's not pretty. The soundtrack from Goblin is fantastic. It's an electronic score that takes a bit of getting use to but is put to great use in the film. It's especially effective during scene building tension. It's one of those soundtracks that's so good in a movie with a lesser caliber filmmaker it would have taken over the film.The performances are okay at best. For a film like this is more about the atmosphere, the setting, the soundtrack and the gore. They serve their characters well enough to keep the film moving. The story may start off thin but there is a deep back story that is revealed as the film goes on. I would love to see what happen to some of these characters to see how they got where they are. This is another one of those scary movies where you just don't trust kids. There was always something sinister about children in the 70's. Dario Argento created a fantastic film that help promote the slasher genre and the supernatural genre for years to come. There are plenty of films that this one has influenced. It is a hard balance when tackling two genres in one film but this one rides the line well. "},{"Title":"He's really ugly, isn't he?

The emotional detachment that she portrays in her character adds significantly to the mood of the film. Argento also uses color for setting mood brilliantly, much in the same style as Kubrik, though not with quite with the subtleness as Kubrik used color in his films. The acting of the rest of the cast is satisfactory at best, with the exception of the first two victims who shouldn't have been given any dialogue in the film. 3/5 stars for low grade acting and poor special effects.

Here we have a young American dancer joining a prestigious ballet school in Germany, who comes to discover that things are not right at her new digs. There are hints of witchcraft, but unfortunately this is dealt with only on the most esoteric level, and the menace manifests itself mostly in the more pedestrian form of a knife-wielding slasher.  But a more evil presence lurking is the insidious film score, that truly takes on the role of unseen stalker and lends a sense of surreal terror to the proceedings.

On the night Suzy arrives however, one of the students is brutally murdered and a friend, Sara, has some terrible suspicions about the teachers ...Some great movies are intellectual experiences (12 Angry Man), some are emotional experiences (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest), but my favourites are almost always sensory experiences - movies that are about nothing but image and sound. Suspiria is an amazing movie in this regard; an all-out assault on your eyes and your ears, with stunning direction, amazing use of colour, eye-popping sets and an incredible soundtrack. Prior to this, Argento made crime thrillers with tones of horror - with this film however it's as if he cut loose all ties to reality and went insane with artistic excess, to incredible effect. The film pulsates with life (the title literally means breathing), bleeding out glorious reds, blues and greens (it was deliberately printed using the old 3-strip Technicolor process) and the score by synth-rock band The Goblins screeches you into submission; it sounds like a bunch of lunatics growling and hitting anything they could lay to hand in the recording studio. Argento lifts the whole movie into a unique fairy-tale horror universe with the simplest of shots (rain rushing down a drain, clothes on a washing-line, an empty square) and Luciano Tovoli's photography is outstandingly inventive throughout. There's a rear-tracking shot in a swimming-pool, a crane shot that hides behind a lightbulb, a moment where the camera drinks a glass of wine and countless other astonishing tricks which combine to create the most incredible fear effect. To some extent the cast play second fiddle to the wild imagery, but there are several great performances. Harper is unforgettable in the lead, a cult classic performance if ever there was, wandering bewildered through the action (I love confused performances, like Theresa Russell in Track 29 or Jason Statham in Snatch). Valli and Bennett (both of whom were great beauties in the youth) are wonderful as the horrible old crones, Casini is terrific as the doomed Sara, and Magnolfi and Kier have great little roles. Detractors of this type of movie always pontificate on plot illogic or silly moments (Looking for Sarah ? She's disappeared ! is one of my favourite lines), thereby missing the complete entire point of the experience - cinema isn't reality, there are no rules and the wilder the ride the more fun to be had. I only wish more filmmakers had the courage and the technical ingenuity to make such as a sensational and audacious film. Written by Argento and actress Daria Nicolodi (who is in several of his other movies, but not this one). One of the scariest, creepiest, most original horror films ever made, with an unforgettable score; an absolute must-see for all lovers of pure cinema.

And here is where the true authorship of Suspiria becomes a gray area.Daria Nicolodi, who played the female lead in Deep Red, had begun an affair with Argento, which would result in one child (a daughter, Asia Argento, who would grow up to become a successful actress and filmmaker) and a volatile romance/creative collaboration. According to Nicolodi, it was she who encouraged Argento to break out of the murder mystery mold and move into horror fantasy. Furthermore, she claims that Suspiria's story, of a German dance academy awash in black magic, was inspired by true-life tales told to her by her grandmother. In the end, Nicolodi came away with a screen writing credit, but only after fighting Argento tooth and nail over the credit.Of what there is no doubt is that the fanciful premise of Suspiria inspired Argento to new peaks of visual creativity. Using a special process to print the film in Golden Age of Hollywood Technicolor, Argento and cinematographer Luciano Tovoli splash their canvas in primary colors of such richness that the viewer can almost taste them. The over-the-top camera movements and editing from Deep Red were taken even further over-the-top in Suspiria, into a dimension of pure cinematic delirium. The gore which had been mostly implied in Deep Red now splashed all over the screen.Scoring their second Argento film (the first being Deep Red), Italian rock band Goblin provide the icing on the cake, with an eerily childlike refrain segueing seamlessly into brutal percussion, chants, and Claudio Simonetti's sheer keyboard madness.Even Argento's worst flaws as a filmmaker -- bad acting and lack of plot -- actually work in this fantasy context. Jessica Harper and Stefania Cassini make two-dimensional yet likable heroines, while Alida Valli and Golden Age of Hollywood icon Joan Bennett gleefully chew the scenery as the villainesses. And where Deep Red blurred the lines between reality and nightmare, Suspiria brazenly flies into a world nothing like the one we live in.Argento has feted the classic Disney cartoon Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as Suspiria's main forebear, but I think Suspiria could be more accurately described as a psychotic funhouse-mirror reflection of The Wizard of Oz. Argento made a few more good films (and one more great one) after Suspiria, but his unique cinematic vision was never clearer than it was here. Perhaps if Argento had been more willing to give Nicolodi proper credit, then Argento might not have peaked so early?

Suspiria immediately sets a scene and puts one in the story with a genius one rarely sees in film these days if ever. It is a lost art contained in the works of Hitchcock, Argento, Kurosawa, Tsuruta, and few other brilliant and rare directors whose memory lives on in their films. One gets an overall feel from the film that is reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe.Suspiria is a terrifically magical film because it takes risks that you will never see in movies in today's desensitized age. It does not try to spell things out for you. In this way it's a mystery unfolding, a subtle, intelligent madness of color and sound and ideas.We are drawn deeper into the plot. It's not about the ending, it's about the journey.Incidentally, I love how all the rooms are painted with Escher designs. The walls around the staircase appear papered in a Curelean blue of crushed velvet, hallways draped in red embroidered silk.Suspiria unfolds as the imagination comes tumbling off the screen with all the color and music and emotion of a good book.You never see this kind of attention given to a film anymore, this amount of passion for the art of film coupled with so much skill. It's slow at times, but it's this careful manipulation of vantage and timing that makes the movie so brilliant.One feels the water, feels the mouth breathe words, feels the terrible events unfold each moment. Films like these aren't made anymore but should be studied closely, and savored.Though not particularly a scary film Suspiria is a work of art and makes you feel like you are in the shoes of the lead character, taking the journey with her in this macabre and haunting tale in a world that is all Argento.

This genuinely mysterious story is well made and results to be one of the best ¨Giallo¨ with oneiric , effective aesthetic ; it packs baroque over-decoration , lots of gore , guts and twists plots .

Screeching musical score by Goblin with stereophonic whispers combining to fortissimo soundtrack , heavy-breathing blasts in stereo adding help achieve incredible ghastly moments and including hard rock all dissociation . The voice heard whispering on the bizarre soundtrack by Goblin is that of Goblin band member Claudio Simonetti , it is just gibberish . Even director Dario Argento composed the creepy music with the band Goblin and played it at full blast on set to unnerve the actors and elicit a truly scared performance . The motion picture shot over four months was originally directed by Dario Argento, at his best , he is one of those film-makers who set off simple for frightening us to death . His films display a sharp eye for the bizarre and he usually abandons plot mechanics to provide a bravura display of his technical skill . Argento often uses a particular trademark  Murder victim crashes through window and characters recall clues from memory . His period of biggest hits were the 70s when he directed the animals trilogy  ¨Four flies over gray velvet¨ , ¨The cat of nine tails¨ , ¨Bird with the crystal plumage¨ . They are always riveting to watch , after that , he directed ¨Suspiria¨, ¨Inferno , ¨Tenebre¨ and of course ¨Deep red¨ . In 1995 Argento made a comeback to the horror genre with ¨La Sindrome Di Stendhal (1996)¨ and then by another version of ¨The phantom of the Opera¨ (1998) both of which starred by his daughter Asia Argento . Most recently, Argento directed a number of 'giallo' mystery thrillers which include Insomnio (2001), ¨Il Cartaio (2004)¨, and ¨Ti Piace Hitchcock?¨ (2005), as well as two creepy , supernatural-themed episodes of the USA TV cable anthology series Masters of Horror .

'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen' made me titter and I'm really far too rational. The fact then that Argento makes Suspiria scary for me is a testament to his incredible genius. I do not use the latter word lightly. It is very rare that you see a truly cinematic masterpiece, as opposed to theatre on film. The art direction is simply unparalleled, I can't think of anything with as much visual wow factor from first viewing except maybe John Woo's 'Hardboiled'.This is truly a case of the master surpassing the pupil, Argento taking on Bava's style and transcending him. The colour photography and set design in this movie, makes 'Blood and Black Lace' (Bava - 1964) look like a novice's entry into the canon. I'm not typically a fan of Grand Guignol, 'Suspiria' is a different matter, the concept, atmosphere and camera-work in the murder scenes make for acutely affecting and terribly beautiful tragedy.I liked the mystery element of the story, which really makes Suspiria a kind of giallo crossover (did you work out what 'irises' meant before Suzy Bannion?). Argento utilizes the macguffin extremely well, and has learnt many lessons in suspense from Hitchcock (outdoing him in my opinion).The artwork to be found in the movie, from the Escher wallpaper (and several other wallpapers), to the mural in the dance academy, the stained glass skylight, makes almost every still from the movie worthy of reproduction. I certainly intend investing in artwork from this movie. One senses that Argento does over-egg to an extent, the buffoonish extras in the dance academy (Alida Valli hams it too much for one), the occasionally (only very occasionally) garish photography and over-the-top set design (I didn't like the staircase in the academy at all), come close to making the movie a folie de grandeur. However for the most part Argento's virtuosity is so extremely evident that the movie holds the audience rapt in its spell. If you aren't truly terrified by this movie... you haven't a pulse.Last but not least, the sound track by Goblin, in collaboration with Argento himself, is equalled in horror history only by that of Kubrick's 'The Shining'.

It's beautiful, breathtaking, haunting, and even delivers the gory goods.You don't really get films like this nowadays. It's all about trying to make people jump and the majority of the horror films these days feature an unrealistic looking cast and overly CGI death sequences. Blah to that I say.Suspiria still stands out as how horror films truly should be done. Dario Argento's visual style is absolutely unprecedented. Everything is lit with the most bizarre and bright colors you've ever seen. The blood is much brighter than real life and this just adds to the surrealism which most Italian horror films thrive off of.Sure things often don't make much sense, but it's supposed to be that way. When things are too coherent or too literal it isn't quite as nightmarish. This is widely known for being a horror classic but I have noticed that younger people who have seen it for the first time just don't seem to 'get it'. Unfortunately they might feel a horror film is supposed to follow a certain step by step linear form that has become staple in horror films today.I suggest if you are viewing this for the first time that you get a feel of what Italian horror films are all about. Mood, atmosphere, music, sound, surrealism. All of these elements for films like these are often more important than logic.After just watching it I am surprised to say that there is only one minor problem I have with the film and that's towards the beginning when the two girls get in a fuss with one another. It's the 'names that begin with an 'S'' scene and the two get in each others faces. It seems kind of out of place in the film but it does induce something of a chuckle.Aside from that everything is perfect in mine eyes.The music by Goblin is disturbing. The themes throughout the film will forever stick in your mind. The camera work here is superb. It's one of the best looking films you'll ever see. The actors and actresses that played the school teachers are truly creepy. Down to the little boy in a suit and knee socks.Quite possibly the best Italian horror flick ever made and definitely a top 10 horror film for me.WITCH!

Argento makes bold use of lighting, color, sound effects, and inventive cinematography to give this film a strange but one of a kind visual appeal. The films unique sets add to the odd unusual visuals as well. The story of the film is simple and the plot thin, but Italian films are all about style over substance and its Argento's flamboyant style that uplifts this film.Suspiria builds to extremely intense suspense at times and packs plenty of shocks along the way.The opening sequences feature one of the most terrifying murders in cinematic history! As with Argento's other films, and Italian horror in general, there is plenty of gore in this film. All the more adding to the frightening effect of the film is the awesome, but eerie score by the band Goblin. The Suspiria score is so original and wild that it is perhaps Goblin's best work!The cast is excellent as well. The charming Jessica Harper makes for a likable lead, her performance is pitch-perfect. Stefania Casini is good as a fellow student and friend to Harper. Alida Valli is great as a menacing teacher and Joan Bennett perfect as the school director.Suspiria is must-see horror for genre fans.

But this film must be viewed from a proper perspective to be appreciated. It is not a film that concerns itself with realism, dialogue or even a particularly cohesive storyline. It instead relies on the emotions that it evokes through color and sound. Much like our dreams, backgrounds and timelines shift.The film has a lot of expressionist tones to it and draws the viewer into its non-reality. The people that wrote bad reviews on this site were citing inconsistencies and irregularities in the story. They just don't get it. We all know that hands don't really appear out of nowhere to pull someone through a third story window. A prime example of Argento's avoidance of reality is when Suzy spills her wine down the bathroom sink. It doesn't look like wine....but it doesn't look like blood either. It looks like red fluorescent paint.This is not due to bad film making; it reinforces the artificiality of the world Suzy has immersed herself in. We are so concerned with the primary action, like the stabbing scene, we don't even notice that the victim (who was in an apartment room) is now being stabbed against a steel grating. Argento's use of color further solidifies his expressionist style. His colors are coordinated in a psychological manner. The scenes are drenched in color which is not only artificial, but helps disturb the viewer's desire for reason. Even something as innocuous as a toilet becomes evil when saturated in blood-red hues.If taken at face value, Suspiria is an OK horror movie. But because of its hallucinatory nature, along with an incredible and relentless soundtrack, it is truly something special. It is a fairytale like Argento describes. But it is also takes place in the dreamworld, which is why Suzy approaches everything very wide-eyed instead of running from the school from the beginning.This is a film that appreciates with repeated viewings. The color palate and the set designs alone make this film worthwhile. The star of the movie is the Dance Academy itself. I am heartbroken that a remake is in the works. This may be the scariest aspect of this film. Why can't anybody ever walk away from something special?? Odds are that it will be an overblown abomination, much like what befell the classic The Haunting. I truly hope that Suspiria does not become Hollywoodized and mar the beauty and legacy of the original.

Sometimes they are rewarding, often they are not. Like many other films of less pedigree I did not find Suspiria to be particularly rewarding. I had, through various sources, heard about the exceptional artistic craftsmanship of Dario Argento's films and so I eagerly sought them out. I eventually saw both Suspiria and equally unimpressive Creepers (the U.S. cut of Phenomena). I sat through Suspiria and attempted to swallow the wafer-thin plot and cardboard performances. (Note to filmmakers If you don't speak English and 95% of your cast doesn't either...pick another language.), only to await an incredibly predictable and poorly executed climax. (Though not as laughable as aforementioned Creepers.) The camera work, although satisfactory, is hardly groundbreaking (Interested parties check its predecessor Blood and Black Lace). I am truly astounded by the adoration this film receives. Aside from a few flourishing moments the rest of the movie was lackluster and it seems like the main character eventually just trips into the finale.Perhaps I'm lacking in the historical context of 1977 cinema to understand why this film is supposed to stand out. Though considering its contemporaries counted Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Eraserhead I'm still baffled. Suspiria would hardly scare a 10 year old at a slumber party let alone someone old enough buy a ticket for it at a movie theatre.

There is not a moment of this film which is not dripping with artistic excellence, and yet it never lets go of the traditionally macabre, dank, seedy and vile undercurrent in most Italian horror.

He is one of the reasons why I love horror movies.Suspiria is, in the immortal words I heard years ago,'a candy coated nightmare'.This is a film where normal rules of filmaking,such as acting and story,don't apply.reading other comments, this is obviously a point that others can't get past.Atmosphere is what Suspiria is all about. I love the way that Argento plays with rhythm in the film. As a viewer, you are waiting and expecting something to happen.The beautiful and scariest thing about the film is that when they do, you are completely jolted.This is a film that will indeed mess with your head if you let it.To me, this film captures perfectly that feeling of being scared, and being completely unable to identify why you are scared and what is scaring you.Argento achieves this in numerous ways. His masterstroke is the score by Goblin.Very simple, almost like a nursery rhyme, but has the power to set your teeth on edge.Almost as powerful is his use of primary colours throughout the film.Horror movies never look like this.I feel that Argento has been categorised as merely a director of horror movies. His style and sense of craft go much furthur than that.It's people like Dario Argento that remind me why I love cinema as much as I do.The highest recommendation of Suspiria came from my wife a few years ago.On a Saturday morning, I introduced her to the film.

If you are particularly squeamish, then skip his other films and watch this one. It is gruesome, yes, the violence starts very early on, but worth it for it is the most stunning looking horror film. It is an art nouveau nightmare masterpiece. It is obvious that the main focus for Argento was the look of the film. It is saturated in colour, there is much stained glass, opulent early 20th century decor, in fact even the walls are painted with beautiful art nouveau friezes and the set dressed better than the actors.While the setting is glorious, the story does not suffer for lack of attention. Argento does not like to give much away in terms of plot or exposition, he paces it rather slowly and leaves the audience hanging for the next clue to the mystery. The basic plot is as follows a young American girl, arrives in Germany to study ballet and dance at a rather sinister academy. Horrible things occur and she is drawn into the goings on.This is the first of a trilogy of movies, the third still yet to see the light of day. Inferno was the second of the trilogy, but I found this to be the superior movie. Let's hope the third is worth the wait, it has been 24 years since the last installment. Even if you don't view Suspiria as the first of a trilogy, it is a film that easily stands alone.Argento's Giallo films (the precursor to the slasher genre) are very confronting in their depictions of violent death. It is truly gruesome, but beautiful at the same time. Argento's talent is in framing the violence, the pacing of it, the underscoring of it. Take for example the first sequence of violence in the film it is set in a large art nouveau apartment building, framed along darkness, with only lurid red light illuminating the proceedings, until it finishes on a stained glass dome. The violence is depicted in close up, the only wide shots being the interior of this beautiful apartment building. Only when the carnage is over does the camera pan out from the victim to reveal the aftermath of the carnage. The music score is very percussive and frantic, with screams and strange vocal noises every present. It is unnerving, as is the opening Suspiria theme. Listening to the soundtrack (by Italian prog rock band Goblin and Dario Argento) by itself, with no visuals is enough to scare you witless. This is nightmare layered on nightmare. Every cinematic element is designed to scare you and it does.If you are going to watch this film, track down a copy that has not been hacked to pieces by the 70's censors. This shouldn't be too hard anymore, the recent DVD releases of his films promise that they are the uncut original versions as Argento intended. Argento has always had troubles with censors around the world, and it is wonderful that they are finally getting a viewing in their entirety, proper pacing and all. If you are a horror fan and have not seen this film, I guarantee you will develop a real appreciation for the Giallo genre. If you are not a horror fan, watch it anyway as it is masterful visual film making. Either way just see it, it's worth it.9/10 "},{"Title":"Garbage!","Date":"21 April 2002","Score":"8 out of 15 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  This movie arrived at my place of business on DVD and it was something I had never heard of,  so I instantly ran to the web site and began to research it.

Aside from the follow up; the severely underrated Inferno, there really isn't another film like this one. Suspiria is often described as 'an all out assault on the senses', and while descriptions like this are often misguided and pretentious; that is not the case here. The pumping soundtrack courtesy of director Dario Argento's house band 'Goblin' interacts brilliantly with the colour scheme (borrowed from Walt Disney!) and the hallucinogenic chain of events to make a film that has a profound impact on an aesthetic level. Suspiria is definitely lacking in substance - but when the style element is so brilliantly done, who needs substance? The plot is like a modern day fairytale, and it follows a young girl by the name of Suzy Bannion, who travels to a German dance academy. From the moment she arrives, it soon becomes apparent that all is not quite right with the academy, and it isn't long before she's plunged into a world of witchcraft and murder, and decides to escape the academy.Suspiria is famous for it's gratuitous murder scenes, and, like the rest of the film - they don't disappoint. In fact, there is only three murder sequences in the film; the first being the one that attracts the most attention. Dario Argento directs as two girls are murdered simultaneously, and while the effects can be a little hokey, there's enough bright crimson blood to please any horror fan. The other two death sequences are extremely well orchestrated, and show great imagination. We get treated to a girl falling into a pit of barbed wire (...not everything here makes complete sense) and, best of all, a man eating dog! One that thing that Suspiria often receives criticism for is the fact that its plot is rather incoherent. This is a criticism that bears some weight, but I don't really see it as a flaw for the film. Suspiria isn't about plot details or making sense - it's a film that bypasses that stuff in favour of style and atmosphere, and it's these things that are always more important in a horror film. What Dario Argento and his co-writer (and girlfriend) Daria Nicoladia have done is cut out the less important elements and just given the audience what they turned up for. How can you criticise that? Suspiria is often mistaken for a slasher, and it receives a lot of criticism from people who have made this mistake. The murder scenes are few if you go into this film expecting a slasher, but it cannot be criticised for this because it isn't. Suspiria is hard to file into a certain genre or sub-genre; it's not quite Giallo, there's not enough witchcraft for it to be considered a witchcraft film, and it's certainly not a slasher; so since there's nothing else quite like it, I guess the film is in a category somewhere all on it's own. Dario Argento is often passed off as merely a splatter film director, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Argento movies get better with each viewing, and this is because repeated viewings enable to audience to fully appreciate the major talent that Dario Argento is. However, while his use of the camera is top notch; his ability to pull great performances out of his cast isn't. A few performers have turned in good performances in Argento films, but most don't and it seems that Argento doesn't care too much about acting in his films. Saying that, I don't care too much about it either.Suspiria is often regarded as Dario Argento's finest work, and it may well be. It's not my favourite Argento film; but it's up there, and when it comes to importance in the history of film, nothing else that the man ever made even comes close. Every horror fan needs to see the likes of The Exorcist and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre before they're a true fan; and Suspiria is certainly a member of that illusive list also. Consider that a high recommendation.

I like horror movies which are shocking and the opening murders were a bit shocking but i felt that Suspiria had nothing else to offer, there certainly wasn't any excitement like other Argento movies such as Phenomena and Demons.  During the rest of the movie i was struggling to stay awake and i wanted to just turn it off, i knew it wasn't going to get any better. The movie also relies heavily on creepy music, this works because you may never forget that music for the rest of you life.  However the music seems to get louder and louder until you lose your consentration on the movie and it feels like your watching a music video. Something diffrent this movie offers is the use of colours, which is probably why most of the movie was shot in the dark, to make the colours stand out.  I found this to be annoying and hard to watch. I consider Suspiria to be a creepy drama rather than a horror movie.  If you like movies which stand out as being diffrent, then you may enjoy this.

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but considering that many regard this as one of the masterpieces of horror I guess I was expecting more.I can see why this is considered a horror classic to an extent. It has an undeniably unique look and a hallucinatory, dream-like feel. The soundtrack is also absolutely fantastic and fits the mood of the film perfectly with very eerie chanting/growling voices coupled with frenetic drumming and an almost carnival-style melody. There are also some pretty neat and memorable scenes, particularly towards the beginning of the film with the first murder.Sadly, for me the film never quite materialized into something great after an opening that impressed me a lot. It definitely has its moments with some nice horror scenes here and there, but ultimately I didn't think there was much pay-off and the film ends pretty abruptly after a decidedly brief climactic encounter. The plot itself left a bit to be desired as well. I know this a horror film, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed by the 10 minute exposition dump midway through the film where random experts essentially explain the plot to our main character. This is the cheapest trick in the book and it felt very clunky, and it also robbed the film of some of its mystery. Is it really necessary to have an expert tell us that witchcraft and magic are real when the film has been establishing that visually for us? Why write it into the script in such a generic way?The experience of watching the film was a bit unpleasant as well due to a very odd aspect ratio and very, very poor audio quality (and not much better video quality). I truly hope there is a better transfer out there for purchase than the one I received through Netflix, because it is truly terrible and even though I didn't love the film, it definitely deserves a better quality release because the visuals are often very good.Overall I did enjoy the film for the unique visuals, dream-like quality and excellent soundtrack, but I couldn't help feeling a bit underwhelmed when the credits abruptly rolled.

I believe it's left very basic, as to allow more exploration into the deeper and more intriguing aspects. That's not to say it's bad- it's just simplistic in nature. However, it does take somewhat of a turn later in the film (a twist, so to speak), and while it was no jaw dropper, it did surprise me, and made way for a great ending. Characters- The characters, like the story, are very basic. Again, not bad, just simple. They were all very interesting, with distinct personalities, but nothing special (nor stereotypical). The main protagonist (like most horror protagonists) was most likely created for the audience to project themselves onto, and ponder your reaction in their situation.Performances- The performances aren't excellent, and some of them are even a bit wooden. However, this may have been Argento's intention, seeing how it definitely adds to the surrealistic atmosphere. That being said, when emotion needed to be expressed, it was, and very well done.Atmosphere/Tone/Imagery- This movie's atmosphere is absolutely outstanding. It's like a beautiful nightmare, while surrealistic and suspenseful, it's also colorful and amazing to look at. It truly is one of a kind, and coupled with beautiful cinematography and imagery, it's completely unforgettable. It's essentially visual poetry, with a lot of visual storytelling. Some scenes are absolutely beautiful to look at, while also repulsive, which is an achievement that takes pure genius to accomplish. Argento's use of bright colors offsetting the extremely dark storyline was absolutely brilliant. Some of the imagery was beautifully terrifying and surreal. The tone was consistently unnerving, and suspenseful. I could just go on- but I won't due to the 1000 word limit.To conclude, Suspira is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's beautiful, with transcending cinematography and imagery, while also having a surreal, nightmarish atmosphere. The two qualities offset each other so well, that it creates visual poetry, and a cinematic masterpiece.

It's inconceivable that you don't bring your own shoes to class. Why does she receive a costume but everyone in class is wearing a different outfit? No one ties their hair for class? The dancing is terrible and pointless. Everyone is doing their own exercise at the same time? In short it's not worth your time if you are interested in dance movies. Otherwise the plot is illogical but predictable at the same time. The interesting scenes are not worked out, the boring scenes just take forever. The acting is poor, the scary scenes aren't scary and the gory scenes are only funny because of the poor special effects. The music is really loud and jarring. The theme music just plays over and over. In contrast the dialogue is on a much lower volume so you can hardly understand what they're saying - oh yeah also because of the fake German accents. I read here this is a classic. I did notice the scenes all lighted with different bright colours, I suppose it comes across as very artistic.

His screenplay comes to an abrupt halt in its third act as it does in Deep Red, leaving the need for possible explanation. Harper is an innocent as Suzy who is drugged to the point of passing out while dancing. She is warned by Sarah, played by Stefania Casini who speaks of witches and eventually finds herself stranded within a room floored heavily with razor wire. One major weakness is the obvious guilty gazes of the faculty. Instructor Miss Tanner is an overbearing less interesting version of Nurse Ratched or Miss Togar. Joan Bennett is even less interesting as Madame Blanc. Flavio Bucci as blind pianist Daniel is effective but meets a gruesome end via his seeing eye dog. Theme regards the reality of cults and the hopes of escaping in tact.

Some of the acting and writing was A for effort. The story didn't feel like it was going anywhere until the movie was almost over. I realize that there are two movies after this one, but I don't feel compelled to watch them. Disappointed because Dario Argento's talent was not put to use in the best movie.

And I will give the movie a lot of credit because of the amazing atmosphere it creates. Dario Argento achieves this through an incredible combination of unusual lighting and disturbing music (that is really catchy by the way) and it draws the viewer into the movie and makes it a very interesting visual experience. However, the movie does suffer from many things that downgrade the experience for me. I am talking about the incoherent story, the dumb dialogue and the stuff that happens that makes no sense whatsoever. Like in the beginning of the movie when the first girl dies, she looks out the window and sees some cat-like eyes and someone starts strangling her, apparently flying or something cause her window wasn't in the first floor. Also a major problem is that some of the situations the characters get in are very poorly developed. I will say the dancers are pretty hot, though. Many plot points that I believe needed to be explained in the end, weren't, like who exactly killed everyone? And how did they possess the dog to kill the blind dude? I know it is kind of implied but I think they should have done a better job at developing these ideas.In the end I thought Suspiria had an amazing theme and very well done lighting that created a creepy atmosphere throughout, but because of the stupid, unreasonable dialogue and incoherent storytelling, Suspiria is barely a satisfying experience.

Unfortunately, the school is run by witches (and not even the nice Nicole Kidman types from Bewitched).The good the film is spectacular to watch, simply because of the use of rich and vibrant colours in every scene. If ever a movie had 'a look' then this is it.The bad the acting. It's dubbed. And when was the last time you watched a film with Oscar-winning performances that had been dubbed? The acting is pretty bad.The indifferent the musical score. If you like electro (and possibly have seen Dawn of the Dead 1979) you may be familiar with the band The Goblins. Well, they outdo their previous work with a truly loud score. It's supposed to make you jump and create tension. Personally, I liked it, but I've read plenty of negative comments saying how it was too loud, distracting and even made people have to turn the volume up and down all the way through the film.There is gore - low budget stuff though and if you like your horror slow burning and colourful, you might get something out of this.

Something like Deep Red gives you much more familiar territory to work with, there's a serial killer on the loose and in the end we discover who it is simple story, fairly simple execution. Suspiria on the other hand is different, because it relies much more on style. Storywise there isn't that much going on, it has a certain supernatural mystery aspect to it but you figure it out very quickly. The entire strength of the movie is not the solution of the mystery or the (rather weak) climax in the third act, it's all in how unsettling every single scene is. There's never a moment of relief, even in scenes where our main character is completely safe you still don't feel at ease. Argento has the talent to make something out of nothing, to scare you without giving you something concrete to be scared of. The screenplay to Suspiria is far from brilliant, but Argento's fantastic directorial choices make this a true classic.

It has stunning images accompanied by a ravishing soundtrack. It is indeed a spectacle for the eyes.I've felt that Suspiria was greatly influenced by Louis Malle's Black Moon. An innocent girl in a mysterious place with strange people and events in the surroundings. Even the way the characters sound are similar a strange accent desynchronized with the mouth movements. Also, the Old Lady played by Therese Giehse reminds Miss Tanner in certain aspects. I have also felt that Suspiria had a great deal of influence on Kubrick's The Shining.A strange fact occurred to me when I watched Suspiria.

Had I judged it with my usual criteria, I'd have found flaws almost everywhere in the plot and the actors' lines; instead I chose to be let into the fairytale, drifted away by the blue, the red and the yellow paints and eventually lost in its beautiful maze. It's not important that initially there seems to be no princess, no mirrors and no evil stepmothers, only brutal murders and cheesy dialog; it's still a fairytale and they're all there, you'll discover them if you liked fairy tales as a child and if you let yourself into the atmosphere.

Nevertheless it's a movie that dwells in our mind for a long time. But what is really unforgettable in this movie &#x96; and certainly made the difference to turn it into a cult movie &#x96; is that sinister melodic little song, performed by The Goblin, and the intensity of the red in some scenes, as it would signify a blood bath in a symbolic way. In fact it's this symbolism allied to some surreal scenarios that give a different and mystic atmosphere to SUSPIRIA. It has some scenes, especially in the beginning and at the end which are very well shot, with great camera details, nice lights (red mostly) and the sinister sounds I did refer, which combined create a fantastic surreal ambiance. About the horror scenes, especially the gore ones, I assume they were greatly done at the time, but I think they are too dated nowadays; and to a viewer that is used to the modern special effects I think they lose their original shocking impact&#x85; Anyway, SUSPIRIA is generally considered as a cult movie, and I certainly agree with that!

There's literally only a handful of killings throughout as the low body count meant they could elaborate more on every single one of the gore scenes. That means the old 'get stupid character do stupid things and do away with them in the next scene' routine is nowhere to be found in this giallo classic.

So when you see a lot of tired imitators, it's always refreshing to see a movie that somehow gets it right. And if you've seen movies like DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN and BLACK Christmas, you can thank your lucky stars that the filmmakers behind those gems were actually giving up props to the man who definitely knows how to get it right...Master of the 'gialli' genre, Dario Argento. His previous work on classics such as BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET and CAT O 'NINE TAILS were just red-splattered dress rehearsals for his masterpiece, SUSPIRIA, Part One of his unparalleled Three Mothers Trilogy.Suzy Bannion (PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE'S Jessica Harper) comes from America to a big, brooding dance school in Bavaria to study ballet. What she soon discovers is that the only piece she needs to familiarize herself with is the danse macabre...literally. She unwittingly begins to discover clues and signs that indicate that the school is being run by a coven of witches, bent on resurrecting one of the Three Mothers, three powerful witches from what was thought to be merely a fairy tale. But there's absolutely nothing fairy-tale about the first couple of deaths that occur within the initial fifteen minutes of the movie, which depicts one of the most spectacular murder sequences in horror movie history (and that includes PSYCHO.) The rich, vibrant use of color, (inspired allegedly by Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS), imprints itself on the senses in a way that doubles the sensory overload, provided by the shocks and the pounding, nerve-jangling score composed and performed by art-rock group Goblin, (the first of their many collaborations with Argento). Where most films are content to pile one shock-and-gore-sequence on top of another, Argento paces the audience by allowing the scenario to ebb and flow, ratcheting up the tension and suspense so that you almost can't wait to see what's coming next, and if it can possibly top the mind-bending terror that preceded it, (which in this case, it does.)Even with the clumsy dub job, (not surprising for films of this period), Jessica Harper and the mostly Italian cast deliver average-to-very good performances. But what you're really neck- deep in SUSPIRIA for is the style and the atmosphere, and Dario does not disappoint.If you've been jaded by one too many red-dyed Karo-syrup splatterfests, treat yourself to SUSPIRIA, one of the true originals. Even if you've already seen it, but not in a while. "},{"Title":"You have just watched&#133;Suspiria","Date":"9 September 2008","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" One of the characters summed up Suspiria quite concisely at the start of the film. She said, It's all so absurd, so fantastic. I can't think of a better way to begin a description. Sure the gore factor is fake and overkill, the horrible dub job is laughable, and the story is just a jumbled mess that gets loosely tied together by a witch subplot with fifteen minutes left, but there is a lot to like here. The absurdity works for it by creating a dreamlike state and journey through an otherworldly German dance school. Its fantastical elements lend a way to become absorbed in its lush settings, helping allow us to forget the incoherence of it all. The cinematography is quite stunning at times and the use of color and light just magnificent. Add in a killer synth soudtrack from the Goblins and you have some very unsettling stuff. Can one appreciate a film for its artistic merits despite its crude script and performances? I say yes.With a plot concerning an American girl coming to Germany in order to be educated at a prestigious dance academy only to find money-hungry women and grisly murders, you can expect over-the-top craziness. When the darkness between two Greek inspired monuments can cause a dog to bite a man's jugular and kill him and a girl can jump out a window to safety only to fall into a pit of barbed wire, there are no rules. Writer/director Dario Argento seems to have used his fantasy theme as an excuse to show he can creatively kill off characters without being held realistically responsible. The occult plays a huge role in the film and all the weird deaths are easily linked together as events caused by an evil force emanating from the coven of witches that occupy and run the school. Dark magic has no bounds and it will inhabit whatever necessary to inflict the desired action. Whether it the wind, a yellowed snakelike eyed creature outside a window, an otherwise benign seeing eye dog, or one's own body, anything can become a vehicle for homicide.The end of the film really delves into the nightmare/dream state set forth from the start, making it remind me a lot of Twin Peaks and Lynch's Black Lodge with the Red Room. Every architectural setting utilized in the film seems to be a labyrinthine puzzle box to explore. Our lead Suzy eventually finds herself searching through the passageways and hallways in order to finally get some answers to what is happening around her. Turn the purple iris, open the door that holds the living dead, count the footsteps of the instructors to gauge where it is they are going&#151;Suzy is strong willed and sets her mind without faltering. She will not be stopped or scared away from finding out the truth.Played with just the right mix of naïveté and power, Jessica Harper does an admirable job holding the film up. Her Suzy is caught in the middle of a struggle against dissenters at the school. No one can just leave because once they glimpse the truth, they know too much. She is drugged nightly, manipulated into staying at the school, and constantly experiencing death and disappearance of those around her. Effective as the innocent waif, she also makes her horror movie cliché actions appear thought out and possible due to her curiosity rather than stupid and plot progressing like most horror. She opens a door because she wants to, not because that's what we expect in the canon. The rest of the acting is effective, but unfortunately the performances that stick out are because of the horrible over-dubbing. Udo Kier, Mr. Thick German Accent himself, is dubbed over with flawless speech devoid of any accent. You could tell me that it's actually him dubbing his own lines, but I will not believe it. And then there is Rudolf Schündler as his professor colleague; his words are so off track from his mouth movements that I wouldn't be surprised if he was speaking a different language in the visuals. I guess it's all part of the charm and cult quality people have come to love.I will, however, completely praise the artistic merits on display. The set designs are sumptuous and extremely ornate. Each room is painted with a unique pattern and bright, bold colors. Whether an organic, flowery motif or geometrically sharp angles, the camera always tends to settle for at least a brief moment to show off the work. The apartment building that becomes the setting for our first murder is gaudy to perfection with its symmetrical design and colored overhead window. Even the shards of glass sticking out from a woman's body have a sense of beauty to them. But, it is the use of light that truly warrants accolades. The use of red is very prevalent, the connotation to blood an obvious connection, and the light and shadow working along with it helps set the mood with the loud, jarring soundtrack. Composition is carefully planned and through close-ups we are treated to some stunning visuals. The long depth of focus shots are my favorite, between the shot of a maid and the headmistress's nephew shrouded in bright light reflected from a knife to the view of the entranceway as we await Miss Tanner to walk through storming into the rehearsal room, nothing compares to the absolute first sequence. Commencing with Suzy in white against the crowds' sea of red, her approach to the exit is filled with the overpowering score as the camera cuts sharply to her face before the foreboding cut back to the door as its opened, letting the storm brewing outside to be shown. All the safety and security of her once simple life is about to be subjected to the tempest that will threaten to consume her.

When she begins to notice creepy images and sounds around the buildings she soon discovers that there is dark evil behind the walls.Dario Argento is known as the Master of the Macabre. He has a very devoted cult following and granted he should. Argento has an impressive eye for colour and a great ear for music in his films to give them the uneasy feel of something eerie. Even though Suspiria is deemed his best work, it fails to keep the creep factor and shock value one would expect from the hands of Argento, and becomes a film that is more artistic then scary.Argento basically disregards the plot and decides to focus on colours and music to scare his audience. He does this beautifully, Suspiria is one of the few horror films that uses colour to it's advantage. The reds, blues and greens used in the film fit perfectly for each scene and turns them into a visual nightmare. Argento takes these scenes up a notch by adding eerie music, that blends with the colour scheme and go down in history as some of the scariest scenes in horror cinema.Suspiria opens with one of the most brutal deaths ever filmed on screen. A poor woman running away from her nightmares is stabbed, hung, stabbed again, ripped open and her heart stabbed, yet again. It is truly brutal and will stay in your mind well after the film is finished. The film has a hard time trying to continue it's shock and entertainment value after that scene though. Aside from two mediocre scenes that involve a dog's bite to the jugular and a room full of barbed wires, Suspiria falls victim to it's own success.You may be wondering why with all this beautiful work done on this film did I not enjoy it? Well, I did to an extent. It is a beautiful film and it is filmed very well from a director that knows exactly what he wanted to do. The only problem is that the film, with all it's artistic merit is boring. Yes, it is boring. When you want a horror film about witches and demons, you want something to keep you either on the edge of your seat or hiding behind a blanket. Other then the opening death scene the film is just a film to respect, not fear. I respect this film, I hold it in high regard for it's technical achievements, but for entertainment value, Suspiria fails to keep my attention. Suspiria is Argento's high point film, it is his best, but it's not at the same time.If you're a fan of Argento and appreciate his style, or a style like his, this film will astound you, you'll be in for a treat.

The storyline, while fantastic, held together and had its own internal logic. Suzy Bannion is a new pupil at a dance school in Germany with rather peculiar staff.  A series of bizarre murders take place and Suzy sets out to find out what's going on, with the aid of a friend of one of the dead girls. She is horrified by what she discovers.......The acting was good (although the dubbing was not always the greatest) and it was shot very well - predominantly dark and brooding to emphasise the evil that was at work.  I also particularly liked the use of red, blue and green filters.  Presumably there is some great symbolic meaning to this, but other than the red heralding the occasional gore that was to follow, I'm afraid that I have singularly failed to see what this might be.Suzy's vulnerability, and the fact that the majority of the action happens within the dance school should have helped to maintain the tension, as the rather bizarre murders begin to take place.  The gestapo like teachers were suitably horrid.  However, the music which was presumably meant to heighten the fear and lead us up to the grizly climax just began to grate after a while.  This meant that, despite the fact that I scare quite easily (I didn't like the scarab beetles in the Mummy, for example) I wasn't actually terribly frightened.At only just over one and a half hours in length, though, it is well worth a watch as it certainly does not outstay its welcome.  Good, eerie entertainment.  If you enjoyed this, then I would recommend 'Don't Look Now' - an equally eerie (and slightly superior) horror thriller from the same era.

Until then, the closest thing the Italian audience had seen to terrifying was Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS. Directors like Mario Bava and Dario Argento saw SNOW WHITE and were inspired by it during their own ventures into terror. Bur Argento never came close to showing his love for SNOW WHITE more than in 1977 with the release of SUSPIRIA. When seen today, it's no wonder that SUSPIRIA remains one of the two Argento titles to have a successful theatrical run in North America (his debut BIRD WITH A CRYSTAL PLUMAGE grossed to the #1 spot). Suzie Bannion (Jessica Harper from PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE) is a young American ballerina who arrives in Germany to join a famous ballet school. The same dark stormy night she arrives, a mysterious girl (Eva Axen) is murdered (in one of the most shocking murder scenes ever shot) and many other strange events start happening at the academy. What is going on? This is the question that Suzie, her friend Sarah, (Stefania Casadini) and the audience will be left asking during the 98 minutes of SUSPIRIA (notice the mathematical mistake at the tagline) and like most of Italian horror, it lacks a logic narrative. We know there is something weird involving witchcraft in this school and we know Joan Bennet is behind it (when Joan Bennet runs your school, you know there is something wrong) but a logical explanation is never given, for the better. The film's tagline is referring to the first 15 minutes, which indeed are horrifying as hell. The image of the hanged blood-soaked Eva Axen remained in the mind Wes Craven, who would pay tribute to it in the opening of SCREAM, (1996) but he didn't come even close.   This is one visual masterpiece that uses the story as a backseat to the breathtaking cinematography by Luciano Trovoli, (MURDER BY NUMBERS)the haunting musical score by Goblin, (DAWN OF THE DEAD) and the dark nightmarish situations from Dario Argento. SUSPIRIA is indeed one of the better photographed films from the 20th century. This is one of those rare occasions that you could choose a random shot and hang it in a museum. Before shooting the movie, Trovolini and Argento carefully studied SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS in order to give SUSPIRIA a fairy tale atmosphere. Jessica Harper's large eyes and skin make her one heir apparent to Snow White herself. Either the the dance academy's red hallways, or the dark blue shadows attic, or the futuristic daylight scene with amazing architecture (early shades of Argento's TENEBRE). Trovoli's camera is always up to interesting moves, like the tracking shot of Alida Valli's feet as she walks to a crate. Argento and his wife Daria Nicolodi (who was supposed to play Suzy before Harper snatched the role) scripted SUSPIRIA based on Thomas De Quincey's drug induced essay Suspiria de Profundis as well real life events that happened to Nicolodi's grandmother. The great Udo Kier goes further with that on his important scene in the film I believe that bad luck doesn't come from broken mirrors, but from broken minds. The script of SUSPIRIA is far from bad, but it is hardly remarkable and the artificial sounding dubbing limit the actors to express themselves visually like the silent film era (Harper, with her expressive Bette Davis eyes, is the true standout). But the technical elements like music, cinematography, and direction make SUSPIRIA the dark fairy tale that SNOW WHITE A TALE OF TERROR (1997) should have been. From the once upon a time narration to the explosive finale, it could be easily translated to a children's storybook. A Halloween storybook that is.

He's really hit or miss in his style. Suspiria is great but if you see it and love it, don't rush out and buy his whole catalog expecting more films of this caliber.The whole movie is highly stylized, and the visual feeling he creates are stunning. A lot of red and blue lighting keeps the atmosphere going, and give it that world of witches feel. Some of the dialogue is really cheesy, but you should know going into an Italian horror movie that there are some concessions that have to be made in order to truly appreciate it.I go back and watch this one frequently, and I would recommend it to all serious horror fans. Casual fans should stay away though due to its extremely graphic content. If you like this one and want to see what else Argento can do, see 'Tenebrae' and 'Deep Red'. Most of his others are for completists only.One final thing I will say about Dario is that, while a lot of his catalog is trash, he's way more talented than most of his counterparts such as Lucio Fulci.9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"Psychedelic naive Horror !!","Date":"11 May 2003","Score":"","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Horror is one of my favourite genres and European horror is some of the most atmospheric and explicit horror in the world. Films such as Tenebrae and Contamination had me hooked from my early teens with there stylish direction and over the top gore! I didn't see Suspiria for years until it was released uncut on video in the UK in the 90s. Like many others who have commentated here the film didn't quite live up to my imagination's renderings of this 'Holy Grail' of Fantasy / Horror. It didn't help that the video was fairly washed out and that VHS is generally not a good medium for all that bold colour. However, I saw it by chance on Channel 4 last night and the cleaned up print made me realise what a work of art Suspiria is. Beautiful and inventive camera work and cinematography. Suspiria is an assault on the senses and probably works best after a little wacky backy if you're that way inclined - watching it on LSD may warp your mind forever so maybe best not go for that approach!!!My main concern with Suspiria and many other Euro Horrors is it's attitude to Occult matters. The witches are portrayed as fairy tale evil doers and so called 'Occult experts' in the film turn up to warn our heroine of the evils of witchcraft. Argento states that he has undertaken Occult rearch for his films but also states that he doesn't believe in Witches !!! This suggests that he doesn't understand the reality of Witchcraft at all and has a simplistic (possibly catholic) view of the Occult and alternative religions. So if you are a witch, be prepared to be appalled at the bad rap you get in this movie ! Well, that's my little rant on the subject - just had to get it off my chest.Besides all that - get the DVD - roll a fat one - and have your head twisted with some of the finest Cinematography ever to grace a Horror movie !!!!

One of the things that makes it so wonderful is the haunting music done by the band Goblin.  It's downright hard to listen to their music at night in the dark.  With music like that Suspiria is likely to be the scariest movie you will ever hear, except for maybe Eraserhead (best sound ever).  The first and last are the downright scariest but there are others inbetween that will still scare you.  Despite the fact that the movie is slow after the first murder it's still not so slow that it diverts your attention and bores.  Jessica Harper may not be the greatest actress in the world but she is beautiful along with some other girls in the movie.  The first murder in the movie is known as the most brutal ever put to film and I agree.  That still is not to say this movie uses only gore to scare you.  It uses music, imagery, story, etc.  All the killings are not just regular slasher murders.  They're all rather creative.  A barbwire murder and possession of a dog are two creative murder methods.  The Romanian guy looks as creepy as hell.  There really isn't much more to say except rent if you are a horror buff but if the kind of horror movies you consider to be the best are ones like Scream avoid this one until you become a fan of cult horror, and can stand a low-budget flick made in the 1970's.

The opening is terrifying and one of the best examples of mood in a film. The score by Goblin is amazing. When it's played in the movie, your flesh just crawls. Everyone knows by now that Argento favors style over substance, so if you like great scripts, dialogue, and acting, keep away! But this movie has so much style that it completely makes up for the lack of substance. The film astounds you and works to scare the daylights out of you psychologically. The music, the sets, the violence...it's all pounded in and really gets to you. The film looks dreamy thanks to an old Technicolor process that adds surreal tones and effective colors, giving it a dreamlike, fairy tale look. It works. There are many complaints about plot holes and lack of sense...it was all on purpose. None of that matters, this is all a nightmare, and like real nightmares, nothing makes sense. This is better than anything that overrated Hitchcock could do. I would definitely recommend this, but keep in mind it is not for everyone.

Having recently watched it, I've found that the film itself is rather simple, but is regarded as a classic because the brilliant atmosphere created by the direction and score is able to add suspense and character to what would otherwise be a bland, standard film.	The plot is surprisingly plain, perhaps because it's been rehashed many times before and since.  I usually don't prefer to do plot summary in my reviews, but Suspiria can be summed up in one sentence a new girl at a renowned dance school discovers that strange supernatural murders are occurring that appear to be related to her teachers and headmasters.  Perhaps the other reason this plot is so simple nowadays is that the concept of an occult evil occurring unknowingly under one's nose at a place with any fame, is ludicrous in light of today's tabloid media.  Although the plot should be and is for the most part executed well, there are still one or two holes, but there are also a lot of scenes that just seem really funny.  Not to mention occasionally the dubbing becomes a little too obvious.	That being said, the film is still intriguing because all of its other aspects are beautiful.  Argento presents the audience with his trademark macabre shots; although not very gory, killings and bodies are presented at viewpoints that are noticeably different than in American cinema (some still look cheesy because of their age, but others, such as the eyes in the window shot near the beginning, are very effective).   Argento is also brilliant at warping the concept of light as safe and good; light is usually only shown as a predecessor to something terrible, making it seem rather evil.  Argento's effective use of darkness is at first distracting, but once adjusted to it adds incredibly to the sense of evil in the atmosphere.	The other piece that adds greatly to the film's eerie atmosphere is the score.  Composed by the band Goblin, it's one of the best soundtracks to ever grace horror cinema, and even cinema in general.  It gives Argento's imagery an even more haunting dream-like impression, and, similar to John Carpenter's famous Halloween theme, never fails to bring tension to a scene.	What Suspiria lacks plot wise in originality, it makes up for with style, and instead of style over substance, the style works with and greatly improves upon its little substance.  Unfortunately, that style isn't readily appreciated by mainstream fans; even for those who do appreciate it, after over 25 years it's beginning to show signs of wearing thin (e.g. the scenes that are unintentionally funny).  However, Argento is still looked upon favorably as a Euro-horror innovator in the art-house/horror circles, however, and seeing Suspiria, one of his more well-known pictures, it's obvious why.

I can't say that I was scared by the film.  The maggot sequence was actually pretty funny.  One minute they're dropping all over the place and the next there's poor Joan Bennett (I read somewhere that she did the film so she could go abroad) in her best finishing school posture and accent explaining away the problem. Don't get me wrong, but there are some genuinely creepy bits.  The scene with Jessica Harper walking down the hall and seeing the old woman and the little boy and then her dance class with the sadistic Alida Valli character was unnerving.The script needed some work.  It is, as others have said, a very dreamlike/nightmarish film, but I need some sort of narrative cohesion in my movies. I also have to agree with the reviewer here who questioned the whole sleep apnea thing.The acting is . . . uneven.  Jessica Harper does fairly well as the young woman who's come to the dancing school and discovers there's much more going on.  I'm not sure what to say about Bennett and Valli.  I've seen it suggested that their performances were supposed to be like that--why, I don't know--but it would be to their credit if that were the case, because both of them gave much better performances in their careers.

This is the Citizen Kane of Italian cinema. A Brother's Grimm Fairy Tale of immensely nightmarish proportions. Driven by a cataleptic internal logic Suspiria has the inherent structure of madness. In such a creation a large suspension of disbelief is needed. From the first moment our heroine (Suzy Banyon) is taken from the real world on the darkest and stormiest night of them all and left in the middle of a German forest at an all girls Dance Academy. From the outset Suzy is thrust into an increasingly malevolent environment. Although her character is for the most part bathed in ignorance of her situation (and impending peril), she does manage to piece together the haunting and supernatural secret of the Dance Academy.The uses of sets, props, music and most importantly color, play a much more narrative role than the dialogue. Some of the characters are anonymous and exist for little reason, much like the guy wearing sandals in front of you at the grocery store.The score to Suspiria was actually created before production began on the film. Argento would play this music on set during filming to create a darker atmosphere for the talent. His use of savage bodily intrusions is oddly offset by the stunning photography. Suspiria is the last film ever to be shot on three strip technicolor. A process where three separate negatives, each one sensitive to only one wavelength of light (red, green, blue) are exposed at once. This is the same process used for such films as Gone With the Wind and the brief color interlude in Chaney's Phantom of the Opera. It creates a very surreal and super saturated color effect. This combined with a classically inspired, yet very renaissance picture composition leaves an image that is unlike any recent addition in the horror genre.This film is not for everyone. Good, who wants them in our club anyway? I've waited for this DVD for years. Turn the lights out, crank the stereo to eleven, grab your woman and hold on. They don't make them like this anymore.

An overall psychedelic experience that will stay with you for the rest of your movie-life. Many claim this to be the best of his efforts, and I don't think they're necessarily wrong.Once again Dario shows that he's a pure genius in creating tension and atmosphere. This time around a girl from the U.S arrives in Germany to stay at a famous ballet-school, intentionally to improve her skills. Very soon grisly murders occur and the trails of unbound evil lead to the very gloomy, mansion-like boarding school, which may accommodate not only harmless ballet-dancers.              Many critics point out, that Dario Argento generally doesn't offer much beyond the undoubtedly visual greatness and rich atmosphere of his movies, like credible characters and a strong narration. They simply forget that his movies are all about pictures and sound, they're aesthetic statements in the first place. Everything else has to serve the main intention. I think we have enough movies out there, failing in terms of showing believable characters and catching the viewer with a complex yet coherent story, even though they're made intentionally for that purpose.

Well perhaps that's unfair because this film rarely hits any real lows but when it does its unfortunately laughable. Other scenes are terrific. I liked the whole premise of Suspiria - its logic is the logic of a nightmare. The film is ripe for a remake and David Lynch is the man. He'd certainly sort out the film's weakest point - the ending. Trouble is he would probably ditch the film's Goblin soundtrack. This is a cross between a nursery rhyme and Black Sabbath and, I think, the film's most powerful element (although I know some people found it annoying).

It contains the most brilliant use of color I've ever had the pleasure of seeing; lurid yellows, blues, greens, and blood reds gush from the screen at every turn, and they're magnificently applied to bizarre Gothic-modern sets and decor. Luciano Tovoli's lens glides over everything like an otherworldly specter as Goblin's electronic rock score chimes, pants, and crashes away on the soundtrack. The result makes you tense up even when nothing important is happening on screen...or is it?But even as the build-up puts you on the edge of your seat, the shocks immediately shove you right off. The murders are thoroughly sadistic yet beautifully presented and are never quite what you would expect. And they don't occur just when you think they will, allowing you to partially exhale before choking on it. Like a true maestro, Dario Argento lets you off the hook for a brief split-second before ramming it deep into your flesh.Wide-eyed Jessica Harper, resembling a beautiful china doll, is perfect as delicate heroine Susy Banyon. Stefania Casini is memorable as her sexy friend. Alida Valli makes a great dominatrix, and Dark Shadows' Joan Bennet, clad in a succession of Walt Disney birthday cakes, is ornately imposing as the stuffy administrator. Every facet comes together fantastically, resulting in a hellish fairy tale brimming with hallucinatory panic and suffocating tension. This pulsating chunk of raw terror is the ultimate testament to Argento's talent. I first saw it years ago on the Sci-Fi Channel, and even in a butchered-for-TV state, it scared the living hell out of me. Truly astounding, Suspiria is horror that like you've never experienced it before.

The tagline for Suspiria, one of the most acclaimed films of cult Italian director Dario Argento, is no idle claim, as it's one of the scariest films you are likely to see. The story, for what it's worth, deals with Suzy Bannion (the doe-eyed Jessica Harper), an American who travels to study at the celebrated Freiburg Dance Academy in Germany, only to find that something evil lurks behind it's walls.  Argento sets his film deep in the heart of Europe, the world of Dracula & Frankenstein, & he draws on old-fashioned horror tales like these for a full-on slice of Grand-Guignol mayhem.  It's Hansel & Gretel on acid.  Argento & cinematographer Luciano Tovoli bathe the startlingly designed sets with a ravishing succession of deep reds & blues, creating a hallucinatory atmosphere like a twisted nightmare world.  Adding to this feel is the maniacally screaming score by Argento & rock group Goblin, with it's weird moans, load thrashes, distorted cries of `Witch!', & habit of starting & stopping suddenly. We see the hairy arms of a killer (Argento himself), but his identity is irrelevant, & Argento also uses animal attacks (including maggots, & a bat) to supreme effect. Ultimately, the fear is not of a mere slasher, but some nameless dread, a sense of all-pervading evil.  This is the closest anyone has got yet to a filmed nightmare. But what of the flaws, then.  Those wanting realism, strong plotting & strong characterisation will be disappointed, although the lack of these actually adds to the unique feel of the film.  To not let yourself be drawn into Argento's nightmare world is like laughing, an easy way out for the weak & cowardly.  It could be accused of misogyny, but Argento merely places in danger those (teenage girls, a blind man) that society traditionally tells us are more in need of protection.  He seems to be asking us more to be shocked & horrified by what happens than to enjoy their pain.  There's no identification with the killer.  The biggest flaw is the climax.  At the end of some of the most nerve-wracking suspense sequences ever filmed, the final face-off is over too quickly & is slightly unsatisfying.  However, the rest of the film is so strong, it barely matters.  Afraid?  You will be.

SUSPIRIA is one of the most incoherent films I have ever witnessed, at times it is impossible to tell who is being slaughtered and why. The dubbing is awful and the vulgar colour schemes with which ARGENTO is always obsessed get annoying. At it's best SUSPIRIA has the atmosphere of a fairytale come to life and has a wonderfully jolting soundtrack. However it seemed to me that the plot has been made up or improvised as it goes along. I preferred the semi-follow up INFERNO which is even more vulgar and incoherent!

I can't watch it at night.Dario Argento entered a new phase of his career as a horror filmmaker with this film.  Up to this point, Argento had made four giallo films, and the obscure comedy The Five Days of Milan (which is a real devil to find in the United States).  For those not in the know, the Giallo is a peculiarly Italian brand of violent murder mystery, which Dario Argento specializes in.  Giallo is the Italian word for yellow, and pulp novels in Italy have yellow covers.  Argento's previous giallo films had a touch of the surreal to be sure, but with Suspiria, Argento's work enters the realm of the hallucinogenic.Argento re-teams with Goblin, who provided the unique synth-rock score for Deep Red, with spectacular results.  The pounding, relentless music sets the tone for the film perfectly.  Brilliant cinematography by Luciano Tovoli (who would re-team with Argento in 1982 on Tenebre) and an unusual cinematographic process in which the old three-strip Technicolor process was used give the film a very unusual, interesting look awash in bright primary colors.

The same goes for Herzog's remake of Nosferatu (horror film / rare successful exercise in style), William Friedkin's The Exorcist (horror film / literary adaptation intended for Academy Award consideration), Robert Wise's The Haunting (horror film / psychodrama and character study), and George Romero's Dawn of the Dead (horror film / social satire / comedy).  Suspiria, just a good, wholesome, highly imaginative, stylized, stay-up- late-if-you-dare scary movie, is the best of its kind.

The second time around, it was playing on a double bill at the drive-in and I was so engrossed in the VERY creepy scene where the blind piano player is ripped apart by his own seeing-eye dog that, when my mother stepped up to my window in the dark, I showered myself with popcorn and soda pop. Ah, the memories... Just the other day, I rented the movie again and sat down to watch it for the first time in decades. It did NOT disappoint. (Nor did it EVER disappoint me I even wrote a letter to FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND in which I praised the film.) The first thing I noticed this last time around was that the veined, pulsing title (courtesy of the Chiodo brothers) of the earlier two versions was gone. But not to worry the memorable Goblin soundtrack is still intact, as are the eerie noises, screams and whispers that tend to raise the hair on the back of the neck. From the beautifully atmospheric opening sequence to the Fall of the House of Escher ending, SUSPIRIA is must-see filmmaking. It's Bava-esque in its look and feel and it COULD be argued that Style trumps Substance (it's ultimately a rather simple story that's nonetheless beautifully visualized, a la Nicholas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW), but so what? Movies are primarily a VISUAL medium, anyway- and, visually, SUSPIRIA is still stunning (even more so now than when I saw it as a kid, because now I can better appreciate what went into the film). Like other supernatural classics like BURN, WITCH, BURN! and even George Romero's SEASON OF THE WITCH (the latter a slow-moving but well-acted version of BURN, WITCH, BURN!, if you ask me), SUSPIRIA works as a fairy tale well-told. (On one episode of THE CINEFILES on YouTube, host Edwin Samuelson tries in vain to defend Argento as a filmmaker against two of his co-hosts.

The unsettling score that opens the film instantly creates an atmosphere of tension, uncertainty & terror and from then on, the film makes its audience notice almost every single element from cinematography, characters, performances, visuals & production design, each carried out in a very bizarre manner.Suspiria follows Suzy Bannion; an American ballet student from New York who arrives in Germany to enroll in a prestigious dance academy in Freiburg. On the night of her arrival, she sees a frightened young girl fleeing from the academy despite the heavy thundershowers & is found brutally murdered the next day. She soon befriends with another student who was the deceased girl's friend & with her help, she finally uncovers the dark secret about the academy.The film has a very eccentric feel & looks like a high-budget B-grade horror (or maybe it is exactly that in the first place). The production design makes strong use of bright, vibrant colours in almost every scene & cinematography emphasizes them in explicit detail. Performances are way over-the-top & exaggerated like one can expect in Italian horrors of the 70s. And same goes with the violence n gore present in the film.But if I've to mention the strengths of Suspiria, then it would be its stylistic visual flair, creepy ambiance, impressive sound design & absolutely terrifying score. The direction by Dario Argento is pretty good & it still remains one of his most admired work. On an overall scale, Suspiria is a very bizarre, very glossy & very nonsensical cinema with a perplexing narrative about witches & witchcraft that'll either leave you very amused or highly frustrated.

So why did I rate the film an 8/10? That would be because of three things. Firstly, the absolutely AMAZING score by Goblin. 100% in the top 5 best horror movie scores of all time. This score for me is perhaps the most chilling I've ever heard. Secondly the vibrant and invigorating colour pallet. The colour red is used in such a masterful way here that the story, characters, script and acting all do not even matter anymore. All that matters is scanning the astounding set design and those bright, bright reds. Thirdly the lighting and camera work are great as well. These three aspects are key in creating one of the greatest horror atmospheres in the history of cinema. The atmosphere of this film is what makes it a classic. It definitely deserves horror classic status but definitely not Argento's best work. I would honestly prefer the sequel to Suspiria, Inferno.

Jessica Harper stars as Suzy Bannyon, an American ballet student who has come to Europe to study at the greatest dance school in the area. But right from the start, nothing of good nature is going on and Suzy becomes more vulnerable to the ominous environment in which she has entered. And while strange things happen in the school, outside, people involved are horrifically murdered. Who or what is the culprit of these eerie occurrences? And will Suzy find out what is going on? Suspiria's plot is a little bit hard to follow. At one time are we are we given a hint as to what is going on, but it doesn't matter. This movie is scary! Not only is the film extremely creepy and filled with BOO! scares, but it shows what Dario Argento is known best for his uncontrollable use of on-screen gore! Argento's murder sequences are a cut above most slasher movies because all of Argento's characters die in creative and surprisingly beautiful ways. Each kill is filmed with lavish colors ranging from blue to orange in the background. And the blood that flows is so red. And all of the murders are shameless and right in your face, always making the viewer extremely on edge.Even though it gains points for being gore-gous, as director Eli Roth describes, Suspiria is a lot more than just a slasher movie. It's quite frightening. A lot of the movie is shot in the dark, and Argento constantly makes sure that you're never far away from a good BOO! The movie is deeply atmospheric, almost like a very mature fairy tale. We are thrown into a nightmare that leaves you on the edge of your seat. People get very uncomfortable while watching Suspiria, just like I did when I first saw it.Jessica Harper is very good as Suzy. She shows a sign of vulnerability that is believable and sympathetic. The rest of the cast also give jobs well-done, especially Stefania Casini as Sarah, Joan Bennett as Madame Blanc and Alida Valli as Ms. Tanner.Dario Argento has said that he got the inspiration from Suspiria from Walt Disney's Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, and it shows. Alan Jones has called the film a Walt Disney-style horror movie. Only Walt Disney would never be this ferociously creepy. The first time I saw Suspiria, I was very entertained and creeped out, and that reaction remains the same each time I watched it. It's a classic horror movie that deserves the status, and I recommend it to all horror fans. A must! The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 92!

This movie though has the easiest plot to follow and is the most understandable of the three. Its conclusion is also better than Inferno as that movie had a conclusion that just came out of nowhere and ended rather abruptly. This movie has the setting of a ballet school and the plot has people being murdered mysteriously. The scenes in this movie are all very well done, having color schemes that make the ordinary look more menacing and really setting a dark and atmospheric tone. Not all scenes are like this as there are some outdoor scenes as the heroine of the movie tries to piece things together and figure out what is going on at the school. The ending is quite good, it too is a bit abrupt like the one found in Inferno, however it makes more sense and you can follow what is going on better in this movie. A bit dreamlike is this movie, but not so much as Inferno and both of these two films trump Mother of Tears in the dreamlike quality of film as that film seems to rely on some rather cheap tricks like the ghost mother and it really pales in comparison to these two films as far as atmosphere.

On the night she arrives, a student flees in the middle of a storm and then dies in the goriest, weirdest, most colorful (and also absurd) manner. It's an interesting start which encapsulates everything about the movie logic goes out the window the moment the first victim goes too; the colors and art direction are just marvellous, everything is shot in hazy hues of red and green, reminding one of a dream; and the murders are all very elaborate and violent.Dario Argento is clearly not concerned with realism here; one can easily find a surrealist undercurrent in this movie. More importantly, he's truly devoted to the mechanics of horror. Up until the '70s horror movies used to be just movies, I guess, trying to uphold the same production values that dramas did. Just look at The Exorcist or Don't Look Now for examples.Argento is already a precursor of the cheap slasher genre which will dominate horror after the '70s. And yet he's one step above crap like Friday the 13th. I have a feeling Argento is more concerned with how to create suspense and induce fear than good dialogue or good acting. He knows how to set up a disturbing scene, and how to kill a person unpredictably there's a murder of a blind man in this movie which just caught me by surprise by its simplicity. Not just that, he knows how to create a feeling of dread, of suggesting horrors around the corner or behind a horror. There's something masterful about his combination of sound, colors and camera movements that makes this movie strangely artistic.This neglect of characterization and story and emphasis on style end up making Suspiria a movie worth watching, especially for anyone interested in learning how to create horror.

Personally, I'm completely against the idea of praising something that you don't actually like, so I respect anyone who thinks that this movie is overrated or even plain awful. My summary is only an opinion, but by no means I intend to make people change their mind or disapprove their concept of this film.'Suspiria' is one of the many Italian horror films that came out during the late 70s and early 80s, that is extremely criticized for having a supposedly questionable plot and denouement. If we compare this movie to some of the other popular films directed by Dario Argento, we're probably going to think that 'Suspiria', is perhaps not as intriguing or well developed, when it comes to the story. To give a few examples of some of the Argento films that are widely considered the actual masterpieces because they offer an intriguing plot, good imagery and well done endings, I would probably name 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage', 'Deep Red' and 'The Cat o' Nine Tails'. So what is it that we should believe? Nothing! Everyone is entitled to their own opinions and even though I agree with those who claim that 'Suspiria' is Argento's real masterpiece, I would never waste my time trying to convince people that this is true. As a matter of fact, I'll be honest and say that I also believe that 'Suspiria' has a somehow underdeveloped story, but I still regard it as one of the best horror movies in history. The reason is simple in my opinion, you can make something wonderful, without a wonderful plot. This is perhaps one of the most visually enchanting horror movies I have seen so far and I honestly doubt I will ever find another film that can enchant me as much as this one. Everything about 'Suspiria' is beautiful, even the violent deaths. I know this may sound sick and disgusting, but I believe Mr. Argento has the special gift to make beautiful images out of gruesome situations, like murder, for example. From the beginning until the end, this film takes us to a dark dreamland with beautiful contrasting colors, eerie locations and a recurrent unsettling music. The locations are perfect. The ballet school in which the story takes place, seems to be a nonexistent place taken from someone's dream. Indeed, it was revealed once that 'Suspiria' was partly inspired by a dream that Daria Nicolodi once had (Mrs. Nicolodi was the co-writer and Argento's girlfriend at the time). So if the idea was to create a dream-like movie, I would say they did a perfect job. Everything about 'Suspiria' looks surreal and charming. It's a dark fairy tale, in which the characters behave in a childish way, like playing along with the scenario. It is also said that the actresses were initially supposed to be little girls, but fearing that the film could be banned, Argento had to choose older actresses, but he didn't really change much of the dialogs, which I think is genius. Strangely, the characters don't come off as moronic or anything, they simply are strange and childish, but in a good way. The subject of sex, for example, is barely even mentioned, which is something that doesn't happen too often in horror movies with twenty-something year old characters. But regarding the actors who played these characters, I would mostly compliment the work of the late actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli. The young cast was simply fine, but no one did a remarkable job. Not even Jessica Harper, who was a bad choice for the lead character, in my opinion. This is probably the only little detail I would criticize about this film. Mrs. Harper pretty much has the same facial expression and tone of voice throughout the entire film, which is not good. On the other hand, like I said before, Mrs. Valli and Mrs. Bennett were flawless as the two bitter old women who run the school with their awful temper and their little psychological tortures against those who stand in their ways. So concluding 'Suspiria' is one of those films that you either love or hate. Both feelings are equally respectable and I can understand why some people don't really appreciate it. But if I have to recommend or 'sell' this movie to someone, I would definitely highlight the dream-like imagery and the creepy music composed by The Goblins, that go perfectly well with what is seen on the screen. Enjoy this dark fairy tale about witches and childish girls.

He is also said to be an angel or demiurge who created Eve from the body of Adam in Forlong's Encyclopedia of Religions. According to the Kurdish Moslem sect of Yezidics in the Upper Mesopotamia (Iraq), Taus-Melek is a fallen archangel, now pardoned, to whom God has committed the government of the world and the management of the transmigration of souls. Melek Tawus is an angel who has fallen from God's grace, and for his repentance, is restored to God's favor. While in hell, Melek Tawus, in seven thousand years filled seven jars with his tears of repentance which extinguished the fires of hell, or at the last judgment will be used to do so. Melek Tawus was banished from the sight of God because he refused to bow down, as asked, before God's creation, Adam. But Yezidis do not identify the fallen angel with a spirit of evil. The act of disobedience has been forgiven by god as a father forgives a wayward son. During the climax of Dario Argento's Suspiria Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) is waiting for the awakening of Mater Suspiriorum (The Mother of Sights) from her ghastly slumber. She is standing near the figure of Melek Tawus, black Peacock Angel, Satan himself. Suspiria is so masterful in its submission of colors and so full of symbolism that its praising is a blasphemy.

Giallo is a genre originating out of Italiy, part pulpy mystery, part fantastic horror and crime stories, part erotic thriller, and always ridiculous amounts of violence. The pulps, are yellow books basically, Gaillo means yellow in Italian, which for some reason was cheaper than white paper and used in a lot of pop novels and magazines at the time. This genre has been Dario Argento's modus operendi for nearly thirty years, and though for the most part, his filmography is full of really, not even amusingly, bad films, this is the one that made him famous enough to make people interested in all the others.For me it's the best, the bizarre and operatic soundtrack by The Goblins alone make it worthwhile viewing. The story is about a girl attending a haunted Ballet school in Germany, arriving the same day of a tragic and grisly murder, and uncovering the dark and ancient secret behind it all. A little slow at times, the story is a loose excuse to run wild with macabre ideas that don't need too much explanation. It's also the beginning of a trilogy continuing with Inferno (the less said the better), and ending with last years The Mother Of Tears.Featuring a mix of slashers, killer dogs, witches, bats, and maggots, Suspiria is a horror funhouse and a masterpiece of genre, but a film mostly for fans and horror enthusiasts, those looking for a movie that's actually scary, might want to look elsewhere, those in for a wild operatic pulp horror have found their golden ticket.

Suzy investigates the strange happenings and discovers that something sinister is afoot within the bowels of the school. Director Dario Argento, who also co-wrote the deliciously macabre script with then wife Daria Nicolodi, does his usual masterful job of creating and maintaining a very potent and palpable sense of absolute flesh-crawling dread. Moreover, Argento stages several set pieces with his customary bravura flair the breathtakingly brutal opening double murders, maggots falling from the school ceiling, blind pianist Daniel (Flavio Bucci) having his throat torn out by his own seeing eye dog, the especially nasty sequence in which the snoopy Sara (the luscious Stefani Casini) falls into a room full of barbed wire (ouch!), and the bloodcurdling conclusion. Luciano Tovoli's dazzling, gliding, sparkling vibrant cinematography and Goblin's wild, howling, wonderfully freaky and frightening full-bore rockin' score make this film a total sensory feast for the eyes and ears alike (Tovoli's photography in particular is highly impressive with its occasional overhead camera shots and striking use of the color red). Harper shines in the lead role; she brings a winning blend of pluckiness and vulnerability to her part. Joan Bennet lends excellent support as the classy headmaster Madame Blanc and Alida Valli contributes a memorably icy portrayal as stern dance instructor Miss Tanner. Better still, a bevy of beautiful young ladies play the extremely catty and competitive students attending the school. Udo Kier has a brief, but neat cameo as helpful psychiatrist Dr. Frank Mandel. My sole criticism is that the big surprise climactic revelation about the school's big dark secret frankly ain't that startling (it's not a good idea to have someone on the soundtrack repeatedly hiss the word witch over and over again throughout the whole picture!). Essential viewing for horror fans.

There were some genuinely scary moments. The music was creepy and the lighting gave a sinister look to the academy. But some of the special effects are definitely dated and some are even comical. Also I am not a big fan of substituting gore for truly scary moments which Suspiria seems to do at times. The ending came off fairly abrupt and somewhat anticlimactic. Perhaps my expectations were too high going into viewing the movie. Also I watched a dubbed version which made it difficult at times to follow the dialog. I tried to compare Suspira it with other movies around the same time period (1977). Suspiria makes a decent showing and I gave it a 6 out of 10. But I suspect younger horror fans that were raised on slasher movies, CGI, and short attention spans might not be able to get into the movie. "},{"Title":"Not bad luck, but bad minds.  Quintessential Argento","Date":"27 February 2008","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Dario Argento is most brilliant at inviting his audience into a world soaked with the savage, bizarre, and somehow plausible while not making a whole lot of logical sense. Suspiria might be one of his masterpieces because he has such a firm control of the medium, but at the same time displays an uncommon enthusiasm for the art of cinema itself. He sticks to what horror fans love (or at least a good chunk of them) the most- skillfully paced and acted and shot and edited and scored and gored-up suspense/kill sequences, and an atmosphere that chills without going into the overboard that we've seen all too much lately in American horror. It's also a film that, unlike some of his others, actually isn't as illogical as possibly expected, mostly due to a good but crucial loophole - the supernatural, which provides a lot of leeway with gaps in logic or questions about motive, springing forth enough surreal imagination to outrank many an inferior Italian horror fright-fest.Jessica Harper stars as a woman who is going to a dance school, but there's something funny going on. Rather, not so funny there's been two brutal deaths in one night, the same night Harper first arrives, where a sadistic killer has taken a frantic woman through the wringer and slain another woman equally frantic on the lower level. There's some foul play going on, with Harper getting drugged up each night and nodding out while the women in charge of the school seem to be up to something. There's another death, a blind man by his own dog, and then Harper's good friend seems to have left without a trace, but is really in the darker recesses of the school itself. What is going on? A coven of witches? A possible bad burial ground somewhere? Maybe more for the former it would seem, right out of legend and folklore and 19th century mythology. It's on! Right away we get here some of the Argento classic style little talk, sharp music from Goblin that is like a mix of a music-box and 70s synth/metal with would-be supervision from John Carpenter. And the cinematography might be the most inventive and dazzling in color and depth and whatnot; I almost imagine Raoul Coutard circa Pierrot le fou was grafted on for the production and injected with a shot of Giallo-vision, and then instructed to provide, in most instances, the kind of measured shocks that have given Hitchcock the reputation he now has. Onward to the plot, if there is much of one, which as well seems to be not as silly as Phenomena or just whacked out like Opera, as there is some very solid line of character going through the proceedings (only a scene where Harper talks to an old expert on witchcraft drags, as any exposition in a genre film might lean toward without the best writing).And in scene after scene, sequence after sequence, Argento solidifies the reputation he has today when he is on top of his game. He's not afraid to go for some of the extra shots of gore or blood that have marked Italian horror the way it is in retrospect, but he's also classy about it. He piles on the artifice, the hyper-stylized lighting, the repetitive and sublimely indicative music, the cuts that seem to indicate little clues and hitting-on-the-head barbs of tension that combined with the performances (which, much like the style, could fit just as well in a super Gothic silent film) makes for a refined sensibility in approaching the genre. It's important to think of this as much, if not more-so, for the art-houses than the grindhouse or even cineplex.Something like this, if by some out-of-left-field chance of getting made today by a filmmaker free only to his desire for what he wants to see, was made to criticize the a genre often with a lack of any artistic depth for cheap, exploitive thrills (Argento was indeed a film critic at one time), and at the same time celebrate certain excesses an auteur can have with genre. How does a crazy movie like Suspiria, which alternates between the harrowing and gross (maggots) and absurd (blind piano player with dog) and even fluffy (dancing scenes) have celebration and joy and the like? If you have to ask, you'll never know.

It's a totally other movie than most contemporary horror films, but I have heard that the same director (Argento) has many other similar movies.What I didn't like was the dubbing. Argento let's every cast member speak their native tongue and they dubbed it over in English later. This makes for some comical situations in intense moments. The main cast members (protagonists and antagonists) did all speak English as native language, but for some reason they had to dub their own dialogue later anyway. The lip sync on the main character is quite okay, the rest is not.Now about the movie itself. The story is quite stupid (though optimists may label it 'minimalistic' p) and the end is horrible. Horrormovies shouldn't have anticlimaxes, the tension build up was good but then it just disappoints.Suspiria relies on tension and mood for 99% of it's entertainment worth. The plot is pretty irrelevant. And the acting was luckily not important since it wasn't very good at all.Argento really uses VERY theatrical music (which I didn't like but it does create a certain appropriate effect) and he drenches the screen in vibrant primary colors, with scenes dominated by great pools of reds, blues, yellows and greens. This provides for a very special effect and I really dug it. It's an inspired fever dream of a horror movie,surreal and very stylish.I'll end with the best Suspiria has the best opening scenes of any horror film I've ever seen. It's beautiful, thrilling, haunting, intense, disgusting...all in a couple of minutes scenes. Of course I'm not talking about the first scene, but the scenes when the main character arrives at the academy.Furthermore, there are three additional scenes that are simply superb the scene with the blind man on the empty square (BRILLIANT!), the scene with the roommate (where the lights go out -)) and the scene with the red lights in the sleeping quarters.In conclusion I have a love-hate relationship with horror films and I do too with this film. I love the intensity and the cinematography, but hate the theatricality, bad acting and the overdose of gore (the bloody heart makes me cringe).9/10 for half the movie (the night scenes LOL) , 4/10 for the other half (the day scenes dancing lessons and witchcraft plot *yuck*).

It has a strong atmosphere right from the start, with that drifting use of the camera, staccato use of montage and that pounding, over-the-top prog-rock score from Italian band Goblin. It's certainly a continuation of the style developed in his first film, The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, and nurtured right the way through to his ultimate masterpiece (in my opinion at least), Deep Red. As with that film, the use of colour and wide-screen composition here is ecstatic and heavily indebted to Hitchcock's Vertigo, with those red walls, ethereal white lights, with softer hues of blue contrasting from those sinister, adjacent rooms. As a result, Suspiria could be considered the most beautiful horror film ever made, although; it's not necessarily a horror film at all... that's to say that the film doesn't really make you jump out of your seat with a number of well-timed, well-thought out scares, with most horror films these days really going for the cheap contrast between a lengthy passage of silence and then, a jolting burst of loud noise.Instead, Suspiria is more of a lingering film, presenting us with images and situations that we keep stored in the back of our minds until the time we find ourselves walking alone through a park at night, or making our way up the stairs in our own house, moving past a darkened room, which could hide an unseen foe. As with a lot of Argento, the plot is slight, with some seeing his films as nothing more than an excuse to kill women in elaborate, over-the-top ways... however, for me, there is always something to hold our interest in the story, or some other way of interpreting the plot that makes it of interest to those wanting repeated viewings. For example, some fans see the film as a dream-play, with the whole thing taking place within the lead character's imagination, which could, I suppose, explain the film's dreamlike style and inconsistent changes within the tone and momentum of the plot. It might also better explain the ending, which has always been a little problematic for me... an opinion shared by a few other people on various websites scattered around the net.The film seems like it's building to something epic, but it never really gets there, instead climaxing with a question mark, as opposed to a full stop. Of course, there's also the quasi-sequel Inferno, which some consider to be greater than Suspiria itself, but I haven't seen it for years... then, there's also the fact that the two films were supposed to be part of a loose-trilogy of works subtitled 'The Three Mothers', though, at the time of writing, Argento has yet to deliver the third and final part. Perhaps when this absent third film appears, we'll be able to appreciate Suspiria and Inferno in a whole new light... well, perhaps? What does impress about Suspiria, regardless of the ending, is the creation of it's own world and a completely foreboding atmosphere, with Argento taking the idea of stylistic abstraction to new heights, creating a gaudy, larger-than-life, Technicolor fantasia that owes as much to Disney and the brothers Grimm, as it does to Hitchcock and Mario Bava.There are probably some elements of Freud scattered amongst the fairytale symbolism and allusions to occult horror too, with the notions of youth and womanhood, and the idea of the mother as hinted at in the proposed trilogy's subtitle, though these are just personal inflections on the plot thought out by myself. Like all Argento, the film can be taken at face value, as an over-the-top, slightly silly, slightly camp little occult thriller with pretensions at depth, or, as with Deep Red and, in particular, Tenebrae, you can choose to read deeper meanings into the characters and the overall plot. Argento has said in many interviews since the release of Suspiria that the film was influenced by a trip through the Austria and Swiss boarders with his co-writer/then-partner, Daria Nicolodi, on which he became obsessed with the Austrian-born Rudolf Steiner, whose notorious Waldorf schools had been criticised for allegedly teaching occult practices in the guise of arts-based education. It is this element that acts as the central backbone to the story, with Argento and Nicolodi dispensing with back story and, instead, employing the use of a voice over during the opening credits to fill us in on the background of the central character.Again, this could further the idea of Suspiria as a literal dream/nightmare that the character cannot escape... which would mean that the bludgeoning use of dialog replacement (sadly, a prevalent factor in all post-war Italian cinema) and somewhat over-the-top tone of many of the actors could perhaps make a little more sense in conveying the character's nocturnal state. Of course, as I stated earlier, this is just one of many possible interpretations of the film... at the end of the day, you're enjoyment of the film depends entirely upon how far you're willing to go to buy into Argento's outlandish (and ultimately disappointing) plot... not to mention taking into account how susceptible you are to the overwhelming beauty of his cinematography. It's also perhaps beneficial to the enjoyment of this film if you're familiar with some of the director's other works, in particular his Giallo films, The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, Deep Red, and Terror at the Opera.As it stands, thirty-years on (and about to be remade by Hollywood as a EMO stalk-and-slash love story), Suspiria is a flawed work... somewhat incomplete but still completely unlike any other 'horror' film you're ever likely to see. It has it's own style and it's own little universe and if you choose to immerse yourself in that world and buy into Argento's ideology, you're sure to be rewarded by the film's unique sense of style, elaborate design, and grisly scenes of murder and occult conspiratorial revenge.

Its construction is purposefully unreal and fabricated in order to create a dreamlike, fabled storybook semblance that manifests the perspective of the Suzy, a young girl leaving the security of domesticity for the first time in life. Her child-like innocence becomes juxtaposed with the harshness of reality that she has never encountered before, and as fairy tales did for children, she tries to interpret the unfeeling world while trying to maintain a sense of that said colorful innocence. Indeed, within the film characters are child-like and naive with their world is awash in iridescent luminosity that seems wholly fabricated. The dialogue is simplistic (as if a child was speaking) and the narrative is both uncomplicated and elementary with lapses in logic (as fairy tales often contain). The mystery, however, is potent as if reflects the mystery of a new life that Suzy is encountering. The music is ominous and foreboding, with a palpable dread that mirrors her apprehension in this transitional period within her life. These motifs lie buried just underneath the surface of what falsely appears to be a facile tale of horror. Indeed, it is the presentation of the film itself that is the main focus of the filmmakers as it creates a rich critique of femininity and the transference to womanhood.

But, years later, the film simply doesn't click as well as it once did (for me, anyway). I just finished watching it for probably the half-dozenth time, and spent most of my viewing trying to figure out why its impact has diminished so drastically. Suspiria is not a BAD film, but its very virtues almost work against it--as with most of Dario Argento's other films, a plot synopsis is irrelevant; the gore, intricate cinematography, and gore is the point. Yet Suspiria's plot is a muddle (and best left to a one-line description a dance academy run by a coven of witches) that draws away from the aesthetic pleasures of Argento's visual composition every time he dwells on exposition that comes off as confusing (and confused) within the context of the story (co-scripted by Argento and Daria Nicolodi). Unlike his (then-)Italian-horror contemporary, Lucio Fulci, Argento is a far more calculating director; while we can watch Suspiria and have no doubt of a master stylist at work, this attention to aesthetic detail makes the clichéd characters and the convoluted story even more apparent, thus causing the intended effect to backfire if there's not a single relatable character on-screen, it becomes that much harder to connect with the material. While certain characters have a quirky appeal (the blind pianist, the butch instructor, the hulking Romanian butler), others--like Sarah (Stefania Casini)--come close to breaking through the saturated colors to earn our sympathy, only to be swept away by Argento's stylistic undertow. While Jessica Harper makes a passable protagonist, her role is limited to being worry-eyed and confused throughout (I know how she felt). Suspiria will forever have a place in the history of horror cinema (my 6 is reflective solely of Argento's style and Goblin's score, which is still impressive today), but in the end, it is like being hypnotized in random bursts over the course of 98 minutes instead of a single unbroken trance that would have truly made it a masterpiece.

The atmosphere is unsettling and always creepy. There's a feeling of uncertainty and fear throughout the movie that truly makes you feel part of the experience. Many reviewers have mentioned the relevance of the colorful art direction of the movie. I just want to mention that the fore-mentioned art techniques are visually stunning and give a special vibe for the movie. The colors play important roles for the most important events, and helps the viewer understand some situations. I agree that this is among the most beautiful Horror movies ever made; talking about visuals. The perfect combination between colors and dark is brilliant.There's also room for beautiful gore. The first murder sequence is amazing because it's creative, surreal, and very violent. You don't expect a maniac to crash the window and slaughter poor Pat. The reset of the movie has minimal but great gore. The death scenes are overall impressive and are featured through spectacular camera angles. For example, Daniel's death scene is memorable because before the gore happens, visuals take an important role in the scene when the devil's statue makes an appearance and then suddenly disappears before the dog attack. It's a chilling and scary scene. Also, the chilling ending deserves some special recognition for it's rich directing techniques, the great use of colors, and mainly because the high fear factor. The threatening dialogs of the Black Queen, the dead girl who comes to life (who in my opinion inspired the possessed woman from Evil Dead II), the witch's silhouette, the great gore, the make-up... My respects. It's truly one of the most creepy endings in Horror movies history. Argento knows perfectly how to display terror. So there you go, you have a visually stunning Horror movie. It's a visual experience in terror like none other. Believe the hype. The score also plays an important factor in the movie. The chilling music (probably inspired by The Exorcist) and the background taunting from the witch is simply memorable. My only problem with Suspiria are the over the top characters in some scenes that only demonstrate that Argento has preferences over theater acting. For example, the scene where Olga and Sara insult each other looked truly cheesy and didn't go with the movie's atmosphere. Also, Pat's cheap acting in the opening sequence, as another example. I am aware of the script changes that weren't made in order to make the girls look older but still. Also, Daniel's acting was over the top when it wasn't necessary. For some moments it looked like Argento's movie was taking a cheesy direction. I'm glad it didn't. Also, some scenes feature stupid actions from the lead characters. Sometimes Argento does not pay close attention to behavior reality and he isn't able to give it to his characters. But that's just my point of view. Jessica Harper delivers a great performance filled with dramatism and fear. She's great in her role and a delight to watch. The cast is overall very good with veteran actors and actresses and some amateurs. The plot is very simple and easy to follow and that's what makes you care about the main character. Argento is a specialist in displaying hints that lead to important events in his movies. I mean, some scenes seem to be insignificant for the plot but suddenly take special relevance for important scenes in order to take the story to a new level. Also, some minimal details shown in the movie should be taken in consideration because most of them may have relevance to the plot. The plot is very simple and easy to follow but the sub-plots, hints, and bits of strangeness makes it delightfully complicated in a positive way. The story goes likes this  a beautiful ballet dancer from USA named Suzy moves to a prestigious and snobby academy in Germany in order to complete a three years course. From the very beginning she experiences strange situations involving the mature women who run the academy; that includes the sub-director, and the house-mistress. As time passed and getting the aid from a psychologist and expert in witches, she finds out that the Academy is a witch coven lead by the Black Queen.

Sheer curtains with gold and red appliqués create shadows and atmosphere. In contrast are the stark dance rooms where students practice ballet. But the film itself is glossy and vibrant and the opening murders slightly over-the-top. Because the primary actors speak in their native Italian language, the film is dubbed in English with the exception of the voices of Jessica Harper and Joan Bennet. This adds a very odd feel to the film so that it appears and feels very foreign. Basically, the school is run by a modern day coven of witches.

From the tense buildup to the savage first murder, then the eerie atmosphere to the climatic ending. Tecnicaly the movie is superb, with great camera work, lighting and music. The tension builds superbly and the murder scenes, though few are exquisitely made. True, seeing it now there are some flaws, like the not perfect acting or the really old special effects, but the strengths of the movie truly outweigh them. One of the best elements of the movie is that, in my opinion,is that is is not judgemental as many other genre movies, just a logical (in it's own logic) progression of a simple story. Everybody dies for a single reason and actually makes sense, while the movie does not try to press a point, just shows the events. A must see.

The plot, which concerns a young American ballerina studying at a European school for dance and slowly discovering that it's run by a coven of witches, crumbles at even the slightest examination. And the film comes to a major anticlimax, and then just abruptly ends, leaving one to ask, Is that it? But everything leading up to the end is so stylishly directed, and much of it truly frightening, that the overall impression is of a remarkable fright film.Doing away with the usual dark, shadowy visual style of the typical horror films, Argento instead takes the opposite approach, and bathes everything in lurid, saturated color. The effect, rather than cheapening or diluting the scares, enhances them, because everything takes on a nightmarish and disorienting quality when there are so many colors and visual textures dominating the frames. He also uses an original score tremendously, rivaling that most memorable of horror film scores, the one John Carpenter created for Halloween. (Notably, Argento wrote the music for his own film as well).There are many sequences in Suspiria that deserve to go down in horror film history the opening sequence, of course, of which much has been said, but equally disturbing are the shower of maggots, the attack of the blind man in the middle of a deserted city square, and the final scene in which Jessica Harper's ballerina character stumbles into the bedroom of the head witch.The only strike against Suspiria is the extent to which it steals from Rosemary's Baby, both in plotting and in visual style. But Argento, while perhaps inspired by Polanski's film, deserves credit for making something completely unique of his own.Grade A "},{"Title":"A technical masterpiece","Date":"24 July 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Suspiria is Argento's technical masterpiece.**SPOILERS**American ballerina Suzy Banyon, (Jessica Harper) arrives in Germany to study at the prestigious Tanzakademie Academy. Her first night there, she witnesses two girls in the academy get killed. The head of the academy, Miss Tanner, (Alida Valli) officially welcomes her and shows her to her room, where her roommate, Olga, (Barbara Magnolfi) who tells her about the murders. After a rough start, a series of strange occurrences start happening around the studio. All of them inspire Suzy to do some snooping around the academy. Her investigations brings up evidence that someone at the academy is hiding a dreadful secret, one they will stop at nothing to hide.The Good News This is a classic film. The first thing that most notice is that the movie is simply beautiful to look at. Everything is filmed in shockingly bright colors, and their continual reappearance is refreshing to see. The deep, dark reds and blacks, and the light, fluorescent blues and greens are quite in abundance here, giving the film an almost dream-like atmosphere. The film is journey through the world of dreams, offering many common themes and visions. The constant booming sounds that pop up everywhere in the film continually make the viewer on edge, and drawing them into the story even more. Almost every scene in here has a sound of some sort, and most of the time it comes in at the right moment to jangle the nerves. When it wants to, it can also be as graphic as it wants to. The opening double murder is as graphic and brutal as anything ever filmed, and in terms of opening a movie up, is arguably the greatest opening scene in movie history. It delivers one of the few rare shock jumps and is so creative in it's concept and shocking in it's realization that it has to be seen just solely on this sequence alone. However, unlike other films that start out with a great bang, the film rarely does let up, stopping only for the usual exposition and introduction of characters that are necessary for these films before going right back in into the discovery of the truth at the academy. The greatly hyped closing sequence is rightfully atmospheric and doesn't disappoint at all, especially considering what it's up against. This is a great book-ended film, as it opens and closes on very strong points. There is a decidedly European style to the whole affair as well, mixed in with all the other wonderful attributes to the film as well. From the typical Argento brilliance on the camera to the way of telling a simple story to all the little things inside that can only be found on repeated viewings, this is a European approach to horror in it's most classic sense.The Bad News There is a plain and very harsh truth about the film there's no real jumps in it at all. The film is very beautiful to look at and makes you think, but it doesn't make you jump. It has it's moments of incredible suspense, but this is not a jump tactic. It can be used to set one up, and often times it does try this approach, but it never really delivers the jump that it sets up. The dreamlike atmosphere that it so wonderfully exploits also makes the film simply confusing for first-time viewers. It's purposely done that way, cause as stated before, Argento wants to concentrate on the visual rather than telling a story. What happens is of little consequence. What is important is how it is told, and those who are not used to that can sit through the film wondering what everything is about. It's all symbolically done, and that can be something to first time viewers to get through.The Final Verdict There are a couple things to get around, but make no mistake, this is still a classic entry in the Euro-horror scene and arguably in the genre. This is required viewing by anyone interested in the genre, and Argento and Euro-horror fans will be in heaven with this film.Rated R Graphic Violence "},{"Title":"Argento is a master","Date":"12 June 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Ever since I bought it for $2 on VHS, this has been one of my favourite horror movies. It was the first Italian horror I've seen, and unfortunately is still the only Argento film I've had the pleasure of viewing. If the rest of his film are as brilliant as this however, I'm really missing out! A little tidbit that I've always found interesting about this film is that it was originally written to star children. The producers wouldn't allow this, so Argento cast adults, but did not re-write the script. This really enhances the surreal feel of the film, as many of the lines seemed very out of place coming from women in their 20's.The real strength of the film lies in other ares however. First, the lighting and use of colour. As mentioned, Argento gives the whole film an eerie, dreamlike quality through various devices, but the most obvious and effective is the lighting. Always unnatural and unsettling, it creates a wonderful atmosphere.Add to this the amazing Goblin score and the wonderfully orchestrated deaths, and you have a movie sure to creep out most anyone.

We should have seen this changed, sadly, she enters and departures the story with same and fragile vain expression. Pity.Also, I find rather banal Argento insisted that in this supernatural story, the killings where employed with cold weaponry, making it very prosaic indeed, banal I say considering the promise of the movie as such.Research of witches is also nonexistent, with superb visual splendor should have been complemented with the same amount of witchcraft research.Nevertheless , impressive creation.One you ought to experience for yourself "},{"Title":"One of Dario Argento's finest!","Date":"30 May 2006","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere in any format let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated versions. Unfortunately most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days more people know about the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. Out of all of his masterpieces--Deep Red, The Bird With the Crystal Plumage, and Tenebre among them--the one that stands head and shoulders above all others is Suspiria. I recently sat down to watch this after a long period of anticipation. Everything you've seen and heard about it is true; this is Argento's epic masterwork.It doesn't start out that way, though. American Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) is a gifted ballerina arriving in Europe to attend a rather elite German dance academy in Freiburg. The opening sequences of the film find young Suzy arriving at the airport, hailing a taxi, and heading out to the school in the pouring rain. O.K., you say to yourself, I've seen horror films open with similar sequences before. And you're right--you have seen movies begin in such a mundane way. Then Argento throws out one of his massively disturbing murder scenes, i.e. a young girl from the academy perishes when a knife plunges into her heart. Again, no big deal, right? Wrong. If you've seen a couple of Argento films you know full well how he displays on screen carnage. It goes on and on in gooey close-up, and the same happens here. The stabbing is so gruesome that even this extremely jaded horror fan cringed repeatedly. I cringe now just recalling the sequence. The killing is a rather inauspicious incident marking the arrival of Suzy, especially since the young ballerina happened to witness a few clues that explain what occurred. Of course, she doesn't know that yet. Nor do we. Argento will remind us of these clues at the horrific denouement.And what a denouement! Stylish, haunting, colorful, and deeply frightening; these are the hallmarks of Suspiria, not only in the conclusion to the film but also in the lead up as well. Everything is weird at this academy, slightly askew in an ominous and vague way. Suzy's fellow students seem oddly aloof, the instructors possess a shrill and vicious temperament that occasionally breaks through their carefully constructed facade, and the building itself oozes menace. Strange noises permeate the floors of the building, footsteps are heard shuffling about late at night, and Suzy soon begins to feel ill. What's going on? Well, it's got something to do with the sort of women we normally associate with pointy hats and broomsticks. Yep, you heard correctly Suzy Bannion walked into a building housing a coven of witches. These are powerful women with an ancient past and a horrific record of murder and mayhem. Suzy's investigations into the bizarre events at the academy will soon find her face to face with these malefic old biddies in a series of hidden rooms that positively reek of evil. Will Bannion triumph over the witches? One thing is for sure--one must be careful with creatures that can kill with the wave of a hand.I could literally provide a scene by scene breakdown of this film without revealing any significant spoilers because Suspiria whizzes by in an anarchic way that defies logical description. It's all about style, really, as Argento beefs up the color schemes to frenzied levels. He also imbues the film with his trademark violence, violence that sees a man's throat torn to shreds, a heart repeatedly perforated with a very sharp knife, and a cruel scene involving a room of barbed wire that one must see to believe. Most importantly, Goblin provides yet another immensely haunting score--an eclectic mix of strings, drums, and disturbing voices--that increases exponentially the sense of impending doom the viewer feels as he or she watches the proceedings. Suspiria even manages to cast veteran actor Udo Kier in the role of a psychiatrist who knows quite a bit of disturbing information about the dance academy. Suspiria is Argento's first and best entry in his venerated Three Mothers trilogy (the third installment has yet to appear), and it's far, far better than its follow-up Inferno, an even more confusing film than this one. Without a doubt, all of Argento's trademark techniques find perfect expression in this tour de force.A big movie requires a big DVD, and you can pick up a three disc Suspiria set that gives us the film in all its colorful glory. We also get a lengthy documentary about the making of the film, production notes, trailers, an entire disc devoted to Goblin's chilly soundtrack, and plenty of other goodies to whittle away the hours. I read recently that someone plans on remaking this film, apparently in an attempt to cash in on audiences willing to see updated versions of Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Exorcist, and several other genre staples. I can't imagine anyone creating a better version of Argento's classic film; it's a movie in a league all its own and should stay that way.

Not because of the gore or violence, but because of all of the colors, lights, and the eerie music. Suspiria is about an American dancer, Suzy Banyon, who travels to Europe to attend a ballet school in the middle of the woods. While staying there, Suzy makes some new friends, but also begins to notice strange things happening at the school that she can't explain. Then people start to die in really gruesome ways, and it appears that something along the lines of witchcraft is involved.I don't want to spoil it, but this isn't a slasher movie (like it may sound from my brief plot outline). It is more of a supernatural murder-mystery type film. Suspiria really sets a mood and a feeling for it, and the music by Goblin is creepy and unlike anything I've heard before. The score itself is enough to give you the creeps - it's very effective. It has an intense, unique atmosphere too, primarily because of the amazing sets and the vivid colors. The colors used here are great, all kinds of bright pinks, blues, yellows, etc, usually contrasting with bloody murders and gruesome images, resulting in an interesting final product. Not often to do you see such bright tones in horror films, and that makes this film really stand out. The whole movie is very colorful, and is surely eye candy, this even includes the colorful tones of blood used in the movie. There are also some creative and extremely violent murders that will have you wanting to look away from the screen. Good acting from all involved, (Harper leads the film well) and wonderful, surrealistic direction by Argento. The opening scene was very, very gruesome, and sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is peppered with some solid jolts, savage murders, and hallucinatory visuals. And the final 12 minutes are guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat - I know that I sure was. I'd recommend this, and if you want to buy it on DVD, get the 3-disc limited edition set, it's the way to go. Trust me, I bought it and it's a lot better than the regular DVD release, it includes the regular film disc with a slew of features, and the 2 additional discs are a documentary and the hair-raising soundtrack CD. They even threw in some collectible stills and a thick booklet. The price is worth owning this classic in such a nice set.Overall, Suspiria is a horror masterpiece with beautiful colors contrasting with brutal carnage, threaded together in a mystery that will hold the viewer's attention the whole way through. It's not often that you find a horror film that is quite so graceful and artistic, and Suspiria is one of the few. Not to mention the score Argento uses, which will draw you in and set an uncomfortable, spooky mood -it's difficult to describe, and almost one of those things you have to see for yourself - granted, it's probably not a movie for everyone. For me though, this stands as one of the best horror films of all time. 10/10.

But for the sake of argument, let's presume that some of you may have only just heard of the film, or may actually be interested in what I have to say about it.Suspiria is the story of Suzy Banyon, who arrives at a European ballet academy and is immediately thrust into a series of bizarre and horrific events. Her increasing suspicion of the staff and instructors drive her to discover the cause of a string of gruesome deaths and mysterious disappearances, and eventually she must confront the dark secret behind the founding of the school. The plot twists and turns in a delightfully sadistic fashion, and maintains a high degree of tension throughout the film.But all that takes a back seat to the gorgeous cinematography and superb art direction. Lush, oversaturated colors constantly wash the screen, creating a literal spectrum of emotion, muting themselves only as we approach the final scenes, where their loss only adds to the tension of the climax.Add in a compelling Goblins soundtrack, a heaping handful of Dario Argento's beloved maggots, and two of the most horrifying deaths in cinema history, and you have the makings of a horror classic.

Out of Argento's collection of masterful creations, Suspiria is his best and most accomplished film for a number of reasons.First, we have the score. Goblin is at the top of their game here, producing their most energetic, atmospheric score ever. It fits in perfectly with the film, from the opening theme that will send chills down your spine to the pounding beats that accompany Suzy's discovery of the witch. The music draws you in and completely immerses you in the film. It is a soundtrack you won't soon forget.Argento's trademark use of color is also superb. Everywhere you look, bright reds, greens, yellows, and blues jump out at you, pulling you deeper into the film's surreal atmosphere. You'll be totally engulfed, almost hypnotized, by this bombardment of colors. Argento utilizes the colors to reflect what's happening on screen. If someone is being murdered or evil lurks nearby, everything glows red. If it is dark and silent, blue will permeate through the screen. Yellow will gleam brightly if something of importance is going to happen. Green usually signifies something peaceful or benevolent, which is a welcome break from the horrors witnessed so far.The performances from everyone are top-notch, especially Suzy and Madam Blanc. Jessica Harper nails Suzy dead on, expressing deep concern, intense fear, or amazing resilience. She does a remarkable job crafting her character. Everything that happens to her is entirely believable and we are right there with her through the entire frightening ordeal. Joan Bennett is brilliant as Madam Blanc. She establishes herself as a maternal figure early on, making it very easy to trust her. Throughout the entire movie, her honesty and dependability do not falter, as you continue to trust her completely. All of the supporting actors and actresses do a great job, portraying their characters wonderfully.The gore is cringe-worthy and very convincing, especially the brutal murder that starts of the movie. Argento uses the gore to maximize the effectiveness of a scene. Many of the bizarre and wonderfully original murders are memorable and will become etched in your memory. All of Argento's trademarks are here in full effect as well Glass shattering symbolizing the shattering of the character's idyllic worlds, the violence toward women, the extreme zooms, and the very wild camera angles and movements. All of these are used very effectively to create an incredibly creepy and dreadful atmosphere.The plot is very coherent, despite what some people say, and flows nicely. The ending is effective and very disturbing. It may not be very scary, but it is creepy and unsettling.

It was only natural after his four very successful murder mystery films that Argento would make a full blown entry into the world of horror and the supernatural. Deep Red, although ostensibly a murder mystery had shown Argento's respect and consideration of the codes of the horror genre and with it's very violent death scenes the way was paved. Argento entered a new phase in his career.Suspiria is totally and completely a horror film. A roller coaster ride of fear and terror from start to finish. But a horror film with a particularly European sensibility and outlook. From the opening credits sequence the weird and wonderful primal percussion of the Goblin soundtrack assaults the senses. A soundtrack so original and perfect for the film that it would become very influential within the field. The feeling of uneasiness is with you right from the outset and it never entirely leaves you. Even mundane things like an airport terminal and electronic sliding doors are given a surreal and odd quality. Once outside the airport our heroine Suzy Banyon, played with wide-eyed innocent by Jessica Harper is almost knocked off her feet by the wind and rain, the very elements themselves acting as portents of the brutal violence to come. Through seemingly innocuous and random things such as gushing rivers and a taxi journey Argento has a built an atmosphere of intense dread and fear. Set in the heart of the black forest of Germany Argento plays on aspects of folk lore in much the same way as his US contemporaries were playing on American myths. A Hansel and Gretel like horror that profoundly disturbs due to its child-like nature and connotations. Argento is playing with deep rooted fears within us all and the film's Germanic setting gives it a strange surreal realism, if such a thing can be. But Argento also plays close attention to generic conventions. And shows a surprisingly good understanding of them in what is really his first full horror movie. Like most affective horror movies it is set almost entirely in one location, in this case a very creepy and atmospheric dance school. There are lots of eerie night time sequences and lots of supernatural babble. But where Argento differs from the comfortable expectations of the horror genre is in his technical approach to this film. Argento employed the services of the one of the last Technicolor cameras and the result is astonishing as Argento creates a curious visual palette. He splashes lurid and odd colours into almost every scene. Greens, reds and blues are used to startling effect and grips the audience in the claws of unease that never let up. The narrative structure is also quite strong, which is a surprise for an Argento production. This was the first film in a mooted trilogy detailing the present day incarnations of the mythical Three Mothers. Three figures of ancient evil still alive and functioning. In Suspiria we have the Mother of Sighs and her coven of witches. But these things really are superfluous and play second fiddle to Argento's main interest, which is creating unforgettably ways to kill of his cast. The opening fifteen minutes of the movie are true genius.A horror movie can provide many functions, but its most important one is to scare the hell out of the viewer. If a horror movie doesn't get some reaction from you, then it has certainly failed. In this context Suspiria is easily one of the greatest horror movies. The atmosphere is heavily laden and a great deal of the credit must go to Italian progressive rock band Goblin, who produce a wondrous score. But it is essential to watch this movie in the correct manner, with the lights off and the surround sound on high.

There is a scene that seems very much like the one in Hannibal (a girl is knifed and then hanged). There is a scene with a girl that tried to escape and lands in a mess of razor wire. That scene could have been a lot scarier.The interesting part comes in the last 10 minutes or so, where all the action takes place, but it brings no real climax. Conclusion this is OK as a movie, but fails to capitalize on the story. It could have been done a lot better. Now, seeing that there is a 2005 Suspiria project, I wonder if it is a remake and how well will they do it. Maybe this one will seem a masterpiece after that ) "},{"Title":"The only thing more terrifying than the last twelve minutes of Suspiria... Are the first ninety-two.","Date":"10 June 2005","Score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" There was a lot of Hoopla about this film on all of the horror websites I've seen. The cover of the DVD says One of the scariest movies ever made..., but I've learned it's wise to ignore that over-used line because it's usually bullshit and sets your expectations way higher for the film. But who could resist buying a fairytale film by Italo-lunatic Argento, especially one which is referred to as his 'masterpiece'? Our heroine Suzi Banyon, an American girl with a serious need for some eyebrow plucking, moves into a dance school in Germany, but grisly murders begin to occur there, and she discovers that the school has a dark, supernatural secret...The film opens so well. Right from the beginning there's a sense of dread, the killer eerie music by Goblin feels amazingly ominous and may even remind you of the opening of Mike Oldfield's masterpiece Tubular Bells, which was used so well in The Exorcist, and achieves the same eerie feeling.A few moments into the movie we are treated to an extremely frightening scene involving a window (but doesn't involve catching Rosie O'Donnell changing with the curtains open, there is a limit to how scary these films can be), which then breaks into what has to be one of the most original death scenes I have seen. A sign of things to come? Let's hope so.For the rest of the movie we see some more stylised kills, though none of them quite living up to the first one. However, what drives this film is the tension and atmosphere. I remember years and years ago, seeing the sexy ass French lesbian Vampire film, Shiver of the Vampires, and admiring the atmosphere, in particular the use of red lighting in some scenes, where you wouldn't really find red light. The thing is, coloured light effects are actually not very common at all in modern horror films - they're scrapped in favour of realism, but in the sexy Vampire flick, when I wasn't too busy staring at the nude 70's French chicks, they worked a charm. Suspiria proved to me that the Italians can do that even better, and has provided me with a film which seems to be entirely based around using that kind of atmosphere, to extreme lengths.As with all of Dario Argento's movies, the acting and dialogue is, well, comedy genius. Of the unintended kind. Dario ain't great at English and it shows. He also likes to record the movie without sound and dub the voices on afterwards, which knocks the cheese factor up another 10 levels or so. He even allows some of his actors to speak in Italian to then be dubbed over in English, which causes some painfully bad lip sync.The only thing more terrifying than the last twelve minutes of Suspiria, are the first ninety-two, croaks the creepy voice-over man on the rather korny US theatrical trailer. There's actually an amusing irony to this little gimmick tag-line, as the end of the movie actually isn't quite as good as the rest. Just as the secrets are finally being uncovered, the final battle breaks out and is over before you know it. Questions are left unanswered, before you have even been given the time to ask the question. When our bushy eyebrowed heroine manages to destroy the 'final villain', you almost want to say was that it?.Other than the slight cop-out of an ending, the film was great fun, and the atmosphere wins hands down and this instantly gets to sit in my 'favourites' list.Do yourself a favour and watch Suspiria in the dark. You just can't beat the atmosphere.

As she arrives, the camera turns to another young woman, who appears to be fleeing from the school. She returns to her apartment where she is gruesomely murdered by a hideous creature. Meanwhile, the young American is trying to settle in at the ballet school, but hears strange noises and is troubled by bizarre occurrences. She eventually discovers that the school is merely a front for a much more sinister organization. - From the moment Suzy (Jessica Harper) steps out of the airport at the beginning of the movie, the power of Suspiria is evident. Suspiria is like a Technicolor nightmare. No matter how many times I've seen this movie, I never get tired of it. In fact, I seem to enjoy it more with each subsequent viewing. Very few films have a combination of visuals (each frame of film is like a painting), soundtrack (few films have a soundtrack that so perfectly compliments the action on screen), and story (I've always found the story to be one of the most compelling aspects) like Suspiria. In my opinion, this is very nearly the perfect movie.- It is very difficult to make a horror movie that actually frightens. Suspiria has moments that are to me as frightening as any I've seen. The scene that immediately pops to mind is the bathroom scene near the beginning of the movie. The girl in the bathroom hears a noise and looks out the window to investigate. As a viewer, I just knew something was going to happen. The situation and music are a clear indication that this girl is in trouble. But Argento is very patient and allows the tension to build. When nothing immediately happens, you're sure that Argento had been playing a trick on you. All of a sudden - BAM - you see two eyes staring back into the bathroom. I jump out of my seat every time I see that scene. It's really filmed very masterfully.- One complaint I've read on numerous websites concerns the acting. I tend to think a lot of people are confusing bad acting with the whole dubbing process used by Argento and other Italian directors. Suspiria was originally filmed in English with no sound actually recorded. All of the dialogue was added in post production. Why? Often, these Italian films featured actors who spoke a variety of languages - not necessarily English. During filming, these actors would do their best to phonetically sound out the dialogue. Another persons voice was then often added and matched as good as possible to the lip movements. The lip movements and dialogue are often out of sync and I think some people have a hard time getting past this.

His mastery of certain film-making elements&#x97;the Gothic music of chants and bells, the withholding of a key plot point (here, a crucial bit of dialogue) until the moment of greatest impact&#x97;is undeniable. However, these strengths are largely invested in the delivery of several go-for-broke set pieces that, although quite accomplished in themselves, compromise the continuity and movement of the film as a whole.

When I saw it, I new that it was much more than that, though I didn't know what. I admired Dario Argento's way of constantly keeping the suspense building without allowing any kind of gory release of the tension-keeping the bomb under the table without letting it go off, as Hitchcock put it in is demonstration of the difference between surprise and suspense. After watching the film a second time, I realized that it doesn't merely keep us on the-it, literally, emotionally tortures us. Argento grabs our hearts with his clawed hand and tightens it, little by little. Of course, his visual style, with cinematography by the experienced Luciano Tovoli, is extraordinary because of its magical, music video richness in color and texture; the music, which was composed by Dargento along with a band called The Goblins, is haunting in its pulsating repetition and the monstrous voices singing along. This style is not window dressing; it makes the movie. The pace is purposely sluggish with so little being revealed until the end. Even the final revelation isn't that satisfying. But Argento doesn't want to satisfy us; he wants to terrorize us. This film is not the conventional, delightfully scary horror film; its designed to make you feel frightened, violated, and depressed. It succeeds flawlessly but do you really want to be terrorized, tortured, frightened, violated, unhappy?

It might have the most beautiful set and light design I've seen in this genre - ever. Director Dario Argento is kind of a Tim Burton of the horror genre, giving us a completely unique and visually stunning vision of what other directors would leave as gray shadows and dull props. I guess there's the idea of lighting films in a realistic manner. But in the horror genre, that seems a little silly since the story lines deal with mostly impossible situations and characters anyway. In some ways - and this is a compliment - the look of this film reminds of me of the original STAR TREK TV series, for all it's use of bright color and over-the-top sets. Argento takes it orders of magnitude higher, however, and gives us images that could be taken as stills, framed and displayed in art galleries.SUSPIRIA is not a perfect film by any means, but I believe many fans of this film and its director are won over by the look of it all. And I completely understand that. Where this movie fell short in my viewing was in problems with pacing and storyline. It's great that Argento gave us some nice establishing shots and wide shots of where all the mayhem takes place, but sometimes it seems to linger there too long, and return too often. This coupled with the sometimes confusing order of information we're given (I'd wished we'd gotten things a little earlier or later in places) made the whole feel less than it should have been. And there is a moment or two where the special effects get a bit cheesy by today's standards. I think these moments are magnified by the contrast of how good everything else looks, so it's unfortunate, but probably unavoidable for the day.At this point I also must bring up the issue of gore in the horror genre. There seem to be 2 camps on this subject those that want to see everything in great detail, and those that believe that less is more, and leaving things to the imagination can often be more powerful and effective (I sight JAWS on this issue - we only see one full-on shark attack, and that's at the end - all others are offscreen or have an obscured view, and it's one of the scariest movies ever made). I'm in the second group, so I must say I found certain gore aspects to be overdone, often to the point of trivializing the event. But I'm sure those who like gore in their horror will like SUSPIRIA's content even more. For those who can't handle it at all, however, this might not be your cup of tea. For the rest of you horror fans, even with the plot and pacing issues, SUSPIRIA is one to see at least once. I wish half of the horror films I've seen looked half as good as this one.

I did not personally find it frightening (but it is rare that I get scared by a film), or that easy to follow (usually a bad thing, but sometimes it's good).  It enters into the deep and mysterious world of a ballet school, which was once a place plagued by black magic and sorcery. It features some bloody murders, but they are definietly done in a much more stylish and interesting way then the (generally) American slasher films in the years immediately following the film's release.

A few set pieces are well done, (for those who have a taste for gruesome mutilations), and it must be said that Jessica Harper acquits herself well as the American student forever glancing around to see what mischief is likely to befall next, but poor Joan Bennett I'm afraid comes across as a role-model for Divine, and Alida Valli seems to think she's really on the set of ILSA, SHE-WOLF OF THE S.

Suspiria is not the best one, to put it mildly. It will disappoint all those who look for a scary horror film, because you don't get scared at all when watching it. On the contrary, you'll run the risk of yawning after the first ten minutes. I remember watching it a dozen of years ago for the first time and I didn't understand anything of the plot. Yesterday night I rented it again and concentrated upon every single detail. Although this time I did understand the plot, I found it very boring. I do agree with the criticism expressed by many other reviewers the acting is really bad (but this often seems to be a common feature in many of Argento's films), the music is annoying and really too loud (I kept on changing the volume every time there was the soundtrack playing). But also the script is terribly bad the dialogues are shallow and rather ridiculous. More often than not you feel like laughing. Surely you don't get goosebumps! Some praise the colours and the photography... Well, perhaps they're good if you're watching the film in a movie theatre, but on a home tv screen it gets pretty annoying there are scenes where you just catch red hues, then green hues, then blue, but they lack depth. In the authors' intentions the scenery - I'm thinking of the ballet school - should be sinister, but actually, as the friend who was with me rightly observed, it looks more like a brothel. Needless to say, the plot is completely disjointed. The only actor who didn't act too badly was, in my opinion, Flavio Bucci (the blind pianist). You can forget the rest. Some of the figures were totally pointless (like cute Miguel Bose' in the role of Mark).If you're interested in more films by Dario Argento, I suggest you should look for Profondo Rosso (Deep Red), which is actually more a thriller, but with a great feeling for suspense, or Trauma and Demoni - which are not art masterpieces, but do their work. His latest movie, Non ho sonno, again a thriller, is ok. At least it does its work, even if - this time again - the actors give their worst performance ever.

This is especially true in the horror movie genre. From early entries in the 50's and 60's, whose campy trailers promised thrills and chills to recent times where internet hype made The Blair Witch Project the most profitable piece of Shoestring budget trash in history, hype can make or break a film. It was hype from knowledgable horror movie fans than made me see Suspiria. Needless to say, some of that hype is not deserved.It's easy to tell that Suspiria is made by people who know and respect the horror movie genre. Argento tries to create the most thoroughly creepy atmosphere he could. And in the most part, he succeeds. Most of the film takes place at night, aiming for a dark, seedy look. The opening airport scene combines hard rainfall, a scary soundtrack and darkness for a most chilling effect. Some scenes light up the dark in eerie shades of reds and blues, almost hinting at something creepy lurking on the horizon.Yet the creepy, forboding soundtrack (excellently scored by Goblin) and subtle hints at something wicked coming usually ends up disappointing. One scene in one of the girl's rooms builds up tension well and woefully ends in an infestation of maggots. Other tense scenes such as the one where all the girls sleep in the same area while heaving breathing is heard in the background have unresolved tension. The movie constantly makes you think one thing will happen and something totally different happens. This is evident in the murder of the blind musician. Such as attempt to surprise the viewer is so typical of late 20th century horror films, but ends up flat.The plot also disappoints. As with other movies that are heavy on imagery, such vivid pictures come at the cost of a deep plot. The extremely graphic first murder (one of the scarier scenes in the movie, especially in the uncut version) throws the viewer into the plot. Questions are raised as to what force is causing the murders, but are resolved at a snail's pace. Indeed, none of the questions are thoroughly answered until the film's climax, which is way too subdued and nowhere near as impacting as the opening scenes. The acting carries the movie through the film and the female leads due their jobs as budding scream queens. The actress playing the freaky Directress did is well cast.Again, it is obvious from the chilling opening to the creepy end credits that the Argento and company tried to create a surreal, creepy atmosphere for this film. In that, they succeeded. However, the film builds much tension without giving the big payoff - which is a huge scare. The movie owes much to its brooding soundtrack - the most constantly chilling part of the film. Despite how is disappoints, the surreal imagery and soundtrack do make Suspiria a must-watch for hardcore and even passing fans of the genre.

This isn't straight up horror, it's a murder-mystery-thriller with a penchant for some excessive blood and shock. For what it is, Argento does it well. The collaborative efforts from screen to sound are a work of art. The soundtrack, performed by the band Goblin, in essence, make the film, because it's really not scary at all. Those who coin phrases like, the scariest film I've ever seen are just silly. It's not scary. It's atmospheric. The widely applauded use of angles and color are as good as advertised. It's a very nice looking film. Moods are well-captured and yes, it is quite arthouse in form and thus, loved by film snobs worldwide. Am I a snob? No, but I do well to appreciate something new and different and well-captured and this is a film worth seeing for that alone. The Bad All that good stuff about cinematography and atmosphere aside, the script of this movie is a mess in places and incoherent in others. No one that is not taking a snobbish approach to this film can deny that there are just some flat out bad scenes in this movie. Stilted acting, wooden dialogue... it's all there. This is one of those movies that has received acclaim and now, it seems no one wants to backtrack and call it what it really is... a decent giallo that is far from a work of art. Strictly speaking, the story just isn't a great one... not great enough to stand the test of time. Nor is it told in any way that is unique. The only unique and interesting quality is the way the movie is filmed. That sets it apart and makes it an Argento film. That is great and all, but it doesn't make it a cinematic classic in these eyes. The story is what is missing here. It's just very dull and slow-moving, but done in a nice-looking way. It's a sawdust cake that is beautifully frosted, but has nothing tasty at it's core.The Colorful As stated before, Argento's use of color in the film is truly brilliant. It creates mesmerizing atmosphere and it is unforgettable and makes the film unique and worth watching. The use of bright red blood is one of style and some reviews seem to not acknowledge that (i.e. ...and the blood was just so fake!). Yeah... it's supposed to look that way. Coupled with a musical score that brought out the vibrant reds and greens, the look and feel are as good as any movie out there, horror or not. Too bad the content doesn't match.

Few films offer the audiovisual experience of Suspiria and I have played this movie in a room full of people who have never seen it and nearly everyone was stopping to inquire what exactly I was watching. Whether it's the unique use of a strong primary color palette or the music score by Goblin, something about the film draws them in like nosy people gathering at the scene of a car crash. I once had a friend come over just as the film's opening murder sequence was playing and she immediately looked at the TV with a What are you WATCHING? expression and was completely thrown.But aside from its ability to get attention, it's simply (in my opinion) a masterful piece of art. Every scene is framed and composed in such a unique way, utilizing objects and color to full effect to fill the screen with so much information. It is sad that people tend to focus on the quality of the English dubbing and ignore the film's other merits. I have seen Suspiria called cheesy and this is unfortunate because anyone with some knowledge of film technique would notice the amount of detail put into it.The film's dubbing and the bizarre use of music and color make this an acquired taste for some, which is understandable, but this shouldn't be mistaken for poor craftsmanship.From the fairy tale atmosphere to the entrancing musical score and the bold colors that just pop off the screen, Suspiria weaved a spell on me that has stuck. I have yet to experience such a unique barrage of the sense such as this and it keeps me coming back every time I'm in the mood for a different kind of horror that isn't your typical haunted house or slasher flick.

I like subtlety, sophisticated and psychological scare tactics over pure shock and/or revulsion, and characters I can actually give two shakes about. I don't insist that plots be super-complex, but I expect them to be well executed. Given the numerous times I had seen Dario Argento compared to David Lynch, the reputation his contemporaries have for over-the-top gore and plot holes you could drive a tractor through (charges upheld by what I had seen of Italian 70's and 80's horror so far), I was fully prepared to hate this movie. I EXPECTED to hate it.I loved it.Don't pay attention to the film's detractors' accusations of horrible acting. You'll find no Oscar winners here, true, but you rarely do in ANY horror movie. The acting in 'Suspiria' is actually about average for a horror flick. The dubbing process has dulled some of the immediacy and intimacy of certain scenes, but in all fairness the viewer should make some allowances for that. It's a handicap almost all Italian filmmakers had to work with in that era, and Argento compensates for it better than most.The rich colors, gorgeous sets, creepy lighting and masterful pacing make up for the weaknesses of the dubbing process and occasional lapses in acting ability. (And they ARE just lapses for the most part. The leading lady seems a little confused as to how to move when drowsy, but otherwise gives a decent performance. I can think of only two of the cast who were consistently bad.) The silent characters, unhindered by the dubbing, are thoroughly creepy. The toothless attendant will make you squirm every time he appears.The gore is intelligently handled, graphic enough to frighten but not ridiculous enough to make you stop taking the movie seriously. I won't quibble over realism because for me the brightness of the blood can be forgiven, as it lines up with the surreal colors that characterize the film. It may well have been intentional.As for Goblin, it's true that they make more banging and wailing noises than music, but it's not an album, it's a soundtrack. And it has the desired effect. So music critics, shut up and accept it for what it is.What worried me most about Argento before I watched this movie was the persistent David Lynch comparison. ('Mulholland Drive' is one of the few films I found so terribly pointless that I actually walked out of the theater--and I NEVER walk out of theaters; I'm anal about finishing out what I've paid good money for.) I don't know what people who make that comparison are smoking, at least in this case. There is a coherent plot here, decent characters you actually care about, and the scenes actually relate to one another and proceed in a linear fashion. After this, I'll be giving the rest of the Three Mothers movies a go, and if they turn out to be like this one, I may just move on to Argento's gialli.

Because Dario Argento does not rely solely on the gruesome effects to tell his story he creates an other-worldly, oddly colored (with red predominant), utterly weird scenario that is so bizarre that I have always felt, watching this film, that this is what a bad acid trip might feel like.The plot is almost negligible a young American woman arrives to study dance at a famous dance academy in Germany, and the weirdness starts the second she exits the airport and attempts to get a taxi.I won't reveal any more. The whole thing is so trippy that it has to be experienced, and there are some scenes that Argento seems to have put in the film just because he thought they were scary, since they have little to do with what plot there is.And all the while the proceedings are accompanied by a score that will always rate with the music from PSYCHO, JAWS, HALLOWEEN, and THE EXORCIST as some of the most frightening music ever composed for a film soundtrack.Another bonus to SUSPIRIA is that it gives us a chance to see the great Joan Bennett and Alida Valli in their later years; what they may have lost in looks they have not lost in talent. And I have never understood why Jessica Harper did not become a bigger star.Not for the squeamish. But if you like a good scare, hold on and go for the ride. It's worth it.

Sure there's hits like 'The Craft' and 'The Blair Witch Project,' but when you compare the list of witch movies to the ones about vampires, werewolves, and zombies the number just doesn't measure up. Why this is I don't know, but what I do know is that unlike those other genres where there are many great and yet also some really terrible titles, there aren't many bad witch movies and I'm happy to say 'Suspiria,' one of famed horror director Dario Argento's greatest achievements isn't one of them. I hate to admit it, but I actually didn't see this film until high school and when I finally did I was taken aback by it. It truly is a horror classic that deserves to be remembered.Pros Excellent work from the cast. Absolutely stunning architecture. Director Argento does a spectacular job at both scaring the viewer and making the film a piece of eye candy with use of colored lights and filters, neat camera tricks, etc. Dripping with suspense and dread. Frightening moments and images from right out of a nightmare. Some of the most elaborate and brutal kill sequences ever filmed. Goblin's score is one of, if not their best and really adds to the terror. A generous amount of blood and gore. A pace like a roller coaster; slow and steady one moment, moving a mile a minute the next.Cons The evil is done away with too fast and easily.Final thoughts Unlike many recent horror films, 'Suspiria' is not one that can be easily dismissed as just another routine waste of time. It goes places a lot of horror films are afraid to go and instead of wall to wall gore it uses visceral shocks and suspense to scare the audience. It's not like any horror film ever made before or since.My rating 5/5 "}{"Title":"I Appreciate The Film More Now, But Still Heavily Overrated Argento","Date":"16 March 2008","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" When I first saw Suspiria, and for many years after, I was not impressed at all.

It concerns a young American ballet student, who enrols in an exclusive ballet school, only to discover sinister goings on involving witchcraft. There's not a whole lot to the story beyond this. I didn't find myself gripped to know what was happening next as the film rattled along its wooden acting tracks. The acting for me was the biggest drawback.

Right before a very early moment of killing, it seems like Argento is purposefully overdoing it with the music and the sound. The Goblins' playing is relentless and it seems absurd that it's supposed to lead to anything scary... and then the killing happens. From then on, the music no longer seems extraneous, but only deeply foreboding.Dario Argento's Suspiria is not a horror movie of plot or suspense, but of experience. If Hitchcock depended on Freud, Argento depends on Pavlov, and it's as if this movie is an attempt to classically condition the audience against it's own logic. Visuals and sound unravel at overt levels to set your mind towards terror. Surprisingly, it works despite my better judgment.A young American woman attends an academy for ballet in Germany. She hardly even has time to settle in before crazy things start happening a woman runs out of the school as she's trying to enter, subsequently getting murdered; another young woman taken to the new arrival starts whispering about witches and mysteries; an uncannily scary looking woman and boy reflect light into the American's face, sapping all her energy. The colors are very Hitchcockian and Argento's camera delights in floating around in long takes; his use of dubbing for sound does not create problems as expected but lends a particularly surreal air; he plays with different effects from straight-up gross-out (maggots) to psychological terror (the hallways) to a scene that single-handedly makes the entire Saw series redundant (the wires in the closet). Best of all, he sets it on a place called Ascher Street, in Gothic buildings decorated with Escher interiors.It's hard to exclaim the point as to why this movie is so successful Argento is utterly expressionistic, willing to eschew logic or reality for a good ol' brain-tingling mesh of effects that somehow add up to a very pleasing and loaded aural and visual experience.--PolarisDiB "},{"Title":"Essential art","Date":"30 September 2007","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" So the other night I turned down the lights once again, and saluted the fall with a bottle of Italian red wine, some Italian almond biscuits and a DVD of SUSPIRIA; in Widescreen, in Surround and (in this case) in Italian! With me was my girlfriend who had not seen the film, and once more I witnessed the full power of this magnificent horror film through new eyes.I don't know how many times I've seen Suspiria over the ages, but it never fades in strength. It's one of the most intense films ever made and every time you put it on, lightning strikes. Now, Suspiria being an incredible feast for the senses is one thing, but every time I see this film it grows on me. Not only is this one of the greatest horror films ever (if one wishes to argue THE best, I would not disagree, it's certainly not a bad pick) but it is indeed also a bold and thoroughly conceived film, that - unlike many films, in particular horror films - has to be conceptually understood. I am a big fan of accepting films on their own rules. To me, there are no grounds in film, in the end film has got to be art, and no film can be expected to achieve a certain standard. Film has existed for little more than one hundred years, and I guess this is why film has not yet broken through it's primitive state, as say, the novel did during the Modernist days. Don't get me wrong, I like a good popcorn film any day, and I hold no grudges towards Aristotelean storytelling - I just don't like it as a norm. Still today, priority one of film is entertainment and a film that doesn't pay enough attention to story mechanisms, will be automatically perceived as more or less pretentious or, at best, conceptual or perhaps arty.Now, why this long essay on the situation of art within film? Because, Suspiria is a prime example of a artistically free film. As much as we horror fans love it, many people still have a hard time with it - it has been said by many the actors aren't good enough, the story is ludicrously thin, the dialog is cheesy... and the greatness of Suspiria is that this is exactly the point. You could argue One cannot claim Suspiria being bad, by saying that it is incoherent. It's like saying Schindler's List is bad because it's about WWII. Dario Argento is not interested in the common so called rules of cinema. Like many other European directors before him, the actors are mere models, so are the characters. There is no psychology, no intrigue. We basically never get to know anything about anyone, in the beginning of the film Suzy Bannion is at the airport and she has no identity, in the film she is not given a background, nor a future. The characters speak to each other, but apart from things leading the story along, it's about nothing. It is what's going on around them, and in between them, that matters. It is in the colors, the music, the violence, the imagery, in one word Art. It means nothing or anything, judging on the viewer. It's essential art. This also sets Argento apart from many other Artistic directors (Bresson, Godard...) because unlike their films, Argento's films there are no concepts being followed. Just imagery.Personally, I think Suspiria is one big nightmare. It seems to be the real world, but it really isn't. When Jessica Harper arrives in the airport we are still in the real world. But the realm of Suspiria is lurking behind the doors of the main entrance, apparent with the demonic hisses from the Goblin soundtrack every time the doors are in frame, and the silence when we see Harper move towards them. And when she finally reaches the main doors, she enters the world of Suspiria. A world where people are talking in stiff articulations and where you cannot count on anything being quite the same as it is in the real world. For instance, if you turn out the lights there won't be darkness, but a tone of green or red.Despite it's enormous depth and width in imagery, Suspiria is a very concentrated film (compare it for instance with the followup INFERNO, no less interesting but a total demolition of any kind of coherent storytelling). I am not going to deny that the amazing Goblin score does very much for the film, and it is the element of music that truly makes it masterful. In the pounds, the howls and in the dangerously simple blood red theme, lies the true horror engine Adrenaline. It's impossible not to become disoriented and instinctively scared by it. Added to that, the extreme use of diverse colors, perfect editing and basic Argentoish geniousness, we have a nearly flawless execution of a nearly perfect horror film.But not only that. When film has reached a place that it deserves, we will look back on Suspiria as a role model in modern film making, way ahead of it's time.

Often quoted as one of the finest of that period, the fact that Suspiria stood the test of time is basically due to it's originality compared to films such as The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, who tried their best to make a horror film that was as close as possible to something that could actually happened. Argento goes the other way around, by taking his audience out of the normal world, and into the darkest corners of the subconscious, where fears we long thought didn't exit anymore, childish fears such as those of the Witch in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, are suddenly reborn. With expressionistic set design that seem to suffocate the characters within, as well as extreme use of sound and colors, this is a child's nightmare captured on celluloid. An Argento trademark, he once again proves he's a master at creating some of the most unique death scenes in cinema, which are so bloody violent, and yet the camera lingers on them with childlike fascination, the events bathed in a wonderful combination of primary colors. The script of the film is often criticized, but I consider it quite solid and I just love the fairy tale vibe it has. Indeed, Suspiria is nothing more than a fairy tale, a dark, twisted fairy tale and when you stop to think of it, in the same style the Grimm Brothers use to write their stories. In any case, the plot follows a young American girl joining a renowned ballet school in the Black Forrest in Freiburg, Germany. A series of strange, supernatural events start to take place and soon she finds out the school is merely a front for a coven of evil, and powerful witches. I have to admit the finale is not as great as the rest of the film, but it's good on it's own right and the apparition of the queen witch scares me to this very day. The acting is good, with strong performances by Jessica Harper (who also stared in another favorite film of mine - Brian De Palma's Phantom of the Paradise) as the protagonist Suzy, as well as other great cult starts such as Alida Valli, Joan Bennet and Udo Kier.

Dario Argento is one of the living directors I have the greatest respect and admiration for, and Suspiria is widely considered to be his greatest achievement. For good reasons, that is. In my opinion, this is Argento's greatest movie along with Profondo Rosso of 1975 and the vastly underrated Phenomena of 1985 (his brilliant 1970 directorial debut The Bird With The Crystal Plumage also comes very close), and the ideal proof that Argento is the absolute master of style, atmosphere and spine-chilling suspense. Argento's directing, the brilliant interaction of colorful visual style, ingenious Progressive Rock soundtracks by Goblin and the creepiness, ultra-violent brutality and stunning suspense that will keep you on the edge of your chair throughout an entire movie are incomparable, and Suspiria is the movie that unites all these qualities in the most brilliant manner, an out-and-out masterpiece that epitomizes the term 'Horror' like hardly another film, and that easily ranges among the most atmospherically overwhelming Horror films ever made.American ballet student Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) comes to Germany in order to study on a renowned dance academy. It soon becomes evident, however, that the academy is not only famous, but also haunted by something evil, as more and more mysterious and exceptionally gruesome murders occur...As mentioned above, Suspiria is pure perfection in style, photography and score. Argento's unique color-play goes hand in hand with gruesome violence, and a perfect score by Goblin. The acting performances are great, Jessica Harper is excellent in the lead, and Alida Valli delivers a brilliant performance as the strict dancing instructor Miss Tanner. The cast furthermore includes the legendary Joan Bennet, and German character actor Udo Kier.Seldom have colorful beauty and gruesome brutality matched so perfectly as it is the case with Dario Argento's movies, above all with Suspiria. Those who are very sensitive with violence in movies should be warned Dario Argento has the well deserved reputation of being extreme in the graphic depiction of violence, and Suspiria is one of the movies that have earned him this reputation. The gruesome acts of violence are (very stylishly) depicted in explicit detail, and the film is certainly not for the easily offended. Everybody else, make sure to watch Suspiria uncut and prepare for one of the most stylish and suspenseful cinematic experiences ever brought to screen. Eerie, ultra-violent and highly atmospheric, Suspiria is an utterly brilliant masterpiece of Horror, and a personal favorite of mine that Horror fans and lovers of cinema in general can not afford to miss!

After years in the film industry as a writer (Sergio Leone's C'era Una Volta Il West being one of his best works) and later as director of great horror movies like Profondo Rosso, he finally crafted what many consider one of his best movies so far, and one of the best horror movies ever.The story is a bit simple, as we follow Suzy (Jessica Harper), an American woman who has just been accepted in the most prestigious dance academy in Germany. In the night of her arrival, she notices a woman running away from the school. To her surprise, the woman will be found dead hours later. This is only the beginning of a series of strange events that will convince her that there is something evil in the school.While the plot may be simple (specially when compared to the rest of his work), what makes Suspiria special is the whole composition, the perfect mixture of plot, visuals & music to create emotions in the viewer. Every frame in the picture has a supernatural beauty that makes it look like a canvas. Argento's eye for the visuals has created a aesthetic work hard to equal (even by himself), as he has taken care of every piece of the film.The music is another important part of Suspiria, as it complements the visuals in a perfect marriage. Argento's usual partners in crime, the band Goblin, are in charge of the soundtrack and craft a haunting score that if even alone would be enough to create tension in the audience.Jessica Harper is very good in the lead role, however, Joan Bennet and Alida Valli are truly the stars of the show as the Headmistress & Suzy's teacher respectively. Both give superb performances and capture the attention in every scene they appear. Alida Valli is particularly scary in her role as a very strict teacher.The rest of the cast is very good in their small roles, although a notorious flaw is the fact that most of them were dubbed. Although this was a very common practice in Italian films during the 60s and 70s, the dubbing of Suspiria is at times odd and distracting. This may be the only major flaw in an otherwise perfect film.While not as violent as other works by Dario Argento, the film has its share of gore; and just as everything else in the film, the violence is done in a surreal, almost beautiful way. Suspiria's morbid beauty is both attractive and frightening, and maybe that was what Argento had in mind when he conceived the movie.This visually stunning film is definitely a classic not only of the horror genre, but of film history in general. 10/10 "},{"Title":"Scary if ure 12 years old","Date":"2 February 2006","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Well I cant say much that I personally found good about this film which is a shame considering some of the review's I read about it.As a 28yo man and used to watching scary films like Session 9, this was as scary as finding out you've got odd socks on!

Although the plots in his movies aren't on the highest level, the characters are not convincing enough and all-in-all, the actors are not the best available, his works are very high-esteemed among horror fans. He may be lousy script-writer, but he is one hell of a director. He scares you a lot when you least expect it, and that is what horrors suppose to do (don't they?). Surprising moments are not his only weapon. There are also colors which he uses in most scary scenes. And while most horror movies are dark, Argento's works scream with yellow, blue, green and - especially - red color. The atmosphere in this giallo masterpiece is also built with a horrific soundtrack written (and performed) by Goblin. To summarize, the director of Suspiria and Phenomena maybe don't deserve an Oscar, but he surely deserves glorification.

Never. The colors, texture and nuances are artistic.Artistic. Does anyone see what an achievement this is? It's a slasher film, and it's actually beautiful. I mean, it is gorgeous. Terrifying and breathtaking at the same time. A utter orgasm of movie magic from an era when artistic vision outweighed the dollar.This remake, whatever its aim, will flounder and die. Suspiria, the ONLY legitimate Suspiria, will never be forgotten. Directors have no common sense these days, and have no hope of making a film with the depth and precision of Suspiria.What else shall I say? Shall I describe for you any of the suspenseful unfolding? No, only a monster would deprive an audience of these choice morsels.

She is accepted in a special dance school. Little by little she finds out that there is more to this dance school then meets the eyes.I liked everything about this movie, first off Ill start with the films unique visual style. I've read many times about Argentos colorful and surreal style, now I can see what all the talk was about.Every single frame is bathed in beautiful colors. Lots of Reds and greens and blues. The colors are not just there, I mean the colors in this film are LOUD, they are there for you to notice them and to make every frame that they are in just a beauty to look at. They make the film have a certain surreal feel that only added to the story. The colors perfectly matched the type of feel that the story needed and I applaud Argento for that.His visual style and storytelling also impressed me very much. I noticed that Argento is a bit like Tobe Hooper in the sense that he likes to torture his audience, but not in a bad way. I noticed in quite a few scenes Argento would stretch the tension and the suspense to the point where you feel like your being tortured but in a good way. A good example of this is that scene with the blind pianist and his dog on the streets. The scene is spooky....Argento focused on shadows and buildings creating an atmosphere of dread. You almost feel that at any moment someone will jump out of the shadows...great control of storytelling and suspense that was good stuff.I also enjoyed the music. Again, I think this also was perfectly matched with the type of story Argento was trying to tell. A mix of moans, shrieks, whispers and guitar twangs...that was just eerie as hell. Great job from the Goblins.The gore was there in a few murder scenes...and just when needed. I don't feel that Argento abused of the gore like maybe Fulci would. Argento only reserved that gore for when it was absolutely necessary for the story. But when its there, boy is it there.And as long as I'm talking about the story...let me just say that I'm very surprised that this movie made sense. I remember watching some of Fulcis movies and feeling lost and angry at times at that constant incoherence. Not so here, Argento made a decent and intelligible story. And a spooky one at that. Not a lot of action and not a lot of gore...but if your really into it you'll find that the movie has some truly creepy moments. Like for example, the first few scenes with Suzy in the middle of the storm, the students counting the footsteps of the teachers in the night...the blind mind waiting for his killer to come out of the shadows...just really eeiries scenes. Obviously this movie is more focused on atmosphere and creepiness rather then going for cheap thrills.This is the type of story where you feel that the protagonist is slowly being taken into a dark place that will change them forever, and they are practically helpless to do anything about it. Kind of like Mia Farrow in Rosemarys Baby where she was being dragged into this world of magic and satanism and she was almost completely powerless to it. That is the feeling I got while I watched Suspiria.Well what can I say, I've found yet another movie to add to my best of all time list. Really creepy story, good performances, great style, great music and just good spooky fun.Rating 5 out of 5 "},{"Title":"Hmmm","Date":"16 February 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Alright. I have read the bad reviews that people have given this film. I can completely understand why they have been written, and I respect the opinions of those that have them.Before I go on to explain why I love this movie so much I'll have to talk a little bit about its shortcomings.The major thing that should be faulted is the acting. Perhaps it is just the dubbing, but the acting is quite lousy. Jessica Harper, and some of the older actresses, suit their roles very well yet for the most part the acting verges on being laughable. As well, the pace should be somewhat faulted as there are a great deal of moments that could have been cut out to make it a better movie.When I truly think for myself about this film these are the only problems that I can think of. Certainly these are problems that must be mentioned, yet there is so much that I love in this film. For one, I actually quite enjoy the plot of it. It is simple, yet built up in a way that is exciting and sensible (to some degree). The score is terrifying, though quite repetitive. It is quite an intense piece of music that that band Goblin wrapped together, I must say.As for why this is perhaps my favorite horror movie of all time, save maybe Dawn of the Dead or The Shining, let me rave for a while. This film is like an extremely violent acid trip. The color is completely out of this world, making you feel as though you are part of something truly supernatural or alien. As well, the 'story behind the story' is really really cool and I found it to be somewhat creepy. There are certain scenes, even non violent ones, that just freak me out. Like the scene where Suzy is in the dancing room amidst some horrible sickness. It honestly seems as though she is being literally forced to dance by some strange power in the school.I don't even need to say that this film is atmospheric because that is something that is just known by all horror fans. What I need to say is that it really is quite terrifying. Despite the lack of emotional depth the film remains an emotional experience for me. Maybe I'm just a wacko, but I really really get into this film when I watch it. It is the most violent and elegant piece of horror that I have ever seen in my entire life. There are certain images in this movie that completely haunt me. And yes, the last 12 minutes of Suspiria are completely horrifying.I think perhaps the reason that I love this film so much was that it is the film that made me fall head over heals for horror. I had always been a fan of horror to some degree, but when I saw this it turned into more of a full on fascination. It sometimes leaves me with sleeping troubles to see this movie. See it, and if you don't like it, than discuss that. I can totally see why people both love AND hate this film. In truth, when considering depth of character or social commentary or whatnot, the film does not seem to have so much substance. But when you get beyond this and see it as some sort of a weird nightmarish supernatural world then the style in a way becomes the substance and you just have to let yourself get taken away by it. Sure the plot can be slow and certain moments perhaps would have been better left out, but it is actually something of an engaging story as well. The ending is pure genius, not only because it has the power to scare the living dead out of me, but because it comes together so well. It is perhaps the most powerful ending that I have ever seen in a horror movie, save perhaps the ending of The Exorcist (which is powerful in a different way).So, if Suspiria is not your kind of thing but you still want to give horror a chance I would recommend something like The Exorcist or maybe some of those old Roger Gorman Poe adaptations. But it is always a good idea to keep an open mind to these things. If you accept it for what it is you could just end up having the ride of your life.(By the way, Helena Markos scares the daylights out of me) "},{"Title":"Argento's Suspiria *minor spoilers*","Date":"2 January 2005","Score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" About a year or so ago, my friend bought the DVD of Suspiria because we both had wanted to see it. I watched a documentary about the director, Dario Argento, and was interested in seeing what is considered his best film. I heard in an interview with Alice Cooper that he thought Suspiria was one of the scariest movies ever... quite an achievement if Mr. Welcome to My Nightmare thinks it's a frightening film. Well we never got around to seeing the film until a few weeks ago it was on IFC so I was excited. However, I didn't find this film overly scary. It's the story of an American ballet dancer, Susie, who goes to a prestigious, if not all together creepy, ballet school in Germany. Right from the start there's some strange things happening and within a few minutes there's two dead people, killed in quite inventive ways. As the story goes on, Susie starts finding clues about witches and evil at the school, which of course leads to the thrilling conclusion. Surely it's visually stunning and relatively violent (far less violence than I expected). The thing this film had an abundance of was suspense and mystery. So mysterious, in fact, that I still wonder why witches would need to use a knife to kill people. Wouldn't they just cast a spell or something? Of course, I'm no witch. The constant and repetitive score (by Goblin and Argento himself) is quite unnerving and succeeds in heightening suspense. Overall it was an enjoyable film, if only for the striking visuals. Argento certainly makes gore seem like art. I only wish there was more. Does that make me weird?

Remember Mystery Science Theatre 3000? If that show were still on, I guarantee that they'd be able to make international stars of themselves--cast, crew, production team--just by making fun of this fest of stupidity.Dario Argento must have thought himself an incredibly good filmmaker, because this thing is so self-indulgent and horribly written that a group of seventh graders on crystal meth could have made a better horror film. Nevermind that it was the seventies--there's a little something called Subtlety that filmmakers occasionally use. Argento decides to throw it out the window.Within the first few minutes, a madman (who is never FULLY explained) stabs a girl so many times that he rips open her sternum, exposing her obviously foam-rubber heart so that he can stab it with what seems to be a swiss army knife. The fact that he never re-wrote the original script, which called for none of the actresses to be over the age of twelve, really comes out in the dialogue and acting. In other words, every single person in this movie sounds like a child. A female child. A female child that was written by a man.The last twelve minutes that are so heavily touted are amazingly predictable, except for the parts that were barely explained 23 minutes before. I was all geared up, thinking maybe it'd get a jump or a gasp out of me... no. I actually laughed out loud the entire time.Save yourself the trouble. If the movie isn't enough to keep you away, the DVD extras should be. In addition to the international trailer, which reveals the supposedly horrifying last twelve minutes throughout the entire thing, you get (for no extra charge) the most pathetic goth-band music video ever made. They re-make the Susperia theme in somebody's garage. At some point, the camera pans across the keyboard--and hits the hand of the keyboard player.I do feel bad for insulting the DVD for one reason--the video transfer. If absolutely nothing else (and there aren't any other redeeming factors, trust me), the transfer to DVD is amazing. The video is clear, and for a nearly 40 year old movie, it's absolutely breathtaking. Until somebody talks, tries to act, walks across the scene, gets killed, or... well... appears. Honestly, if a company is going to spend so much money on an INCREDIBLE transfer, why would they waste it on a film I could have done in 24 hours with some friends, a four year old camcorder and Adobe Premiere?

It all did more to distract from the story than enhance it. There were numerous plot holes- such as why were the witches drugging Susy? Why did they kill their blind pianist? Did all of the innocent dancers die/burn to death in the end ? If so-that doesn't seem right... And what was up with that giant slinky that helped kill her roommate ? And what happened to that dancer character who was introduced in the beginning (the one that Susy initially roomed with) and then disappeared from the rest of the movie?

We just don't have someone stabbing someone and they die.  We bare witness to a sickly beautiful kaliediscope of brutality and macabre sophistication.  The opening sequence alone proves this!  From the chilling encounter in the bathroom to the climax of broken glass, blood and dead bodies.  My heart is quivering now thinking of that knife being plunged into that womans heart! Argento treats the bodies like pieces of art...letting the camera soak up their grisly beauty.  The woman in the room of razor wire....such a display of human suffering!  The woman can see the door is slightly ajar, and if she can only make it to the door, she will be free. I must admit, the ending did seem a little rushed, and a trifle underdeveloped....but I don't feel Argento focused on it as much as a modern audience would.  His work seems to be more focused on getting the story on film and making is look and sounds brilliant.  You have to watch this film with the mindset of a 1977 audience.

'Did I just watch the same film, these people are describing?',because 'Suspiria' must rank as one of my biggest cinematic dissappointments in recent years. I was looking forward to this dark tale of modern day witches and initially i must say I was intrigued by the dance academy setting and it's splendidly gothic appearance but here lies my main gripe with the film, that being that on the surface it looks like a much better film than it actually is.  The sheer look of the film is as striking as it is macabre but the admittedly stylish visuals and stunning use of colour and lighting cannot fully paper over the cracks of a frankly preposterous storyline and some pretty shoddy editing. The special FX despite what anybody says are downright lame (a supposedly chilling scene involving a clockwork bat is unintentionally hilarious)and even the much touted soundtrack by Italian prog rockers Goblin (altough initially effective) begins to grate as it is wheeled out on a regular basis to signpost another stalk 'n' slash sequence. Likewise Jessica Harper as our hapless heroine Susy just didn't seem to engage me in the slightest and as she lurches gormlessly from one creepy corridor to another i found myself caring less and less about what was coming next. I realise Argento was attempting to imbue his film with a dream like quality but that is no excuse for the lead actress to sleep walk her way through an entire performance. Personally I feel this movie does nothing to cement Argento's rather dubious reputation and as i sense a snarling 'Emporer's New Clothes' style rant coming on I think it probably best to end the review here. Sorry.  I don't mean to rain on anybody's parade here but it just didn't float my boat. "},{"Title":"Suspiria is way overrated.

The third funny part of the movie comes when two girls are going Sssssss, sssss to each other like snakes.In my opinion, this is not Argento's best work. If you want to see a really good Argento movie get Opera or rent Tenebre or Inferno.They seem better as well.The acting in Suspiria cannot come close to that of Opera. Especially cool in Opera is where the killer shoots the lady through the peephole on the door as she's looking through.Unless you want to see a boring horror movie about a ballet dancer that has a few funny parts to it.

There are reasons he's not known in the US - his films are too...well, European.  Very stylistic, but lacking in any excitement, tension, plot, or story.  The movie is a big, long, painting.  If you wanna just look at the TV for a couple hours, and you're fine with just looking and not watching, this is the movie for you.I can't say this movie is without merit, because it isn't.  If it weren't for this movie, there would be no Halloween.  Stylistically speaking, Halloween takes a lot of its visual substance from this movie, and I'm sure it's influenced many other movies as well.  The story, what little of it there is, is poorly acted and hard to follow.  Most of the story is dull and completely unengaging, but that's clearly not what the director had intended.  I can't tell you what he did intend, because I can't figure it out.If schlocky European crap-horror is your bag, this is the movie for you.

It just doesn't work to spend lots of time showing dark shadows, playing creepy music, and basically shouting at the audience Hey you, this is going to be scar The audience just gets bored, and when the scary thing finally happens, usually after a clichéd lull, we feel relieved that we got through that dull as dirt bit. Horror is much more shocking if stuff actually comes from no where, without a bleeding decade of setup (take the scene in THE EXORCIST where the priest just walks in on a desecrated statue, much creepier than the Linda Blair rubbish, or the popping out alien in ALIEN) This movie gets lot of credit for having brilliant color use. Nonsense it doesn't take brilliance to put gels on lights for a few scenes, or to place neon all over the place. Any disco or porn shop owner could hire a contractor to do that. On a related note, the sets don't add to the horror at all they just look expensive and tasteless. BOOGIE NIGHTS was scarier in its color scheme than this.And the murders? You could tell what was going to happen you knew the main character was going to pull through well enough (so as not to alienate American audiences to this) and you knew the movie wasn't going to spend minutes on a chase with a killer and just let the character go oh no, you were just shouting die already like people do at every slasher flick eventually.

The movie IS beautifully filmed, and there IS a maintained sense of foreboding; but the dialogue and the situations are ridiculous.  The main character continually makes stupid choices, clues fall right into her lap, which lead her into ridiculously contrived situations.  Few of the `scary' scenes have anything to do with what is actually going on at the school, so at the end the viewer is left with a whole lot of unanswered questions.I had probably just heard too much about the film and the director before I actually saw the movie.

Its never real, as real as we are. And surely it is never as rich as what we carry in our inner minds and dreams. The most that externally carried stories can offer is to provide contours that we then apply our own stories. What art is all about is negotiating with us, in perhaps the most elaborate dance in existence, to find things that we can accept and also that we can be enticed to use in building these inner stories.We forget, how much allowance we make, how much artificiality we accept. We accept as real a two dimensional image with elements we know to be fake. We did that a century ago. We accept that certain mannerisms that actors must use to convey selves are somehow similar to what real people use. We accept all sorts of cinematic conventions having to do with structured lighting, assembled scenes and where the placement of the eye makes sense.Most obviously, we accept certain other conventions effects, simplicity, closure in the spirit of this negotiation. And in these we encounter strange treaties that previously were acceptable but no longer are. The overacting of old movies. Special effects that seem unreal now. Obsolete conventions of beauty, seduction, love, horror.That's why a visit to Argento is so interesting. When these were new, they were on the edge of what could work, and for a smaller majority. Today, the artistic values and what we are willing to ignore have changed. So with this film, it is more than a film experience; it is an experience about what once was a film experience. Its like visiting a museum of obsolete gods that still beckon. Argento never cared about the story except as it gave an excuse for the situations he wants us to see mood and (for the times) radical violence against women. His compositions have nothing to do with long form narrative, instead are purely episodic. The things we don't accept today are the bad acting, stupid story and clumsy effects. It isn't that any of these are closer to the world now, its just that we have made different compromises as intents have evolved. But some of the effects are laughable. All the acting seems execrable. The story is apparently vapid in fact it is not so. His original idea was to have a ballet school of almost-pubescent girls, and give us David Hamilton with innocent sexual awakening into bewitched death. That is so promising I almost want to contribute to a fund to have dePalma do a correct remake.In any case, we don't come for that. We come for the visual experience, and that remains classic. He draws exclusively on pure red, blue and green. Much has been made of the tri- color Technicolor print technology, but in fact the colors he chose were not those specified by Technicolor, but slightly off. This gives a shimmer to the colors that you can only see on a big screen with a good print. The first death scene is the most notable and perhaps that is all you should watch. It has no story, only motion, color and shape. Is he important? Is this film, probably his most famous?Yes. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3 Worth watching.

If Dario would ever find the perfect balance between storyline and technique, his films would be true masterpieces. Suspiria is a visually stunning cinema experience. You're just being overwhelmed by the colorful decoration and the blasting thunderstorms. The film makes terrific attempt to build up an unbearable tension but, as the viewer, the silly and far-fetched plot constantly limits you feelings of fear and threat. The whole movie might be a bit overrated, and it's definitely hyped too much. Nonetheless, Suspiria is essential viewing for every self-respecting horror fan because of a few irresistible aspects. The gore and bloody sequences, for example, are perfect representations of Argento's wild and twisted imagination. There aren't that many massacres in Suspiria, but the one you do get see will haunt your mind a long time after you finished watching this film. These killing scenes are shot typically Argento rough camera movements and raw, explicit close-ups of pure violence and terror.

There's so much more that I could name that made me laugh (the 'hissing fight', the bat, the blind pianist standing up and yelling You Stupid Bitch! and sounding exactly like Gene Wilder when he screams it. . ), but I have to stop now.

On second thought, at least I can say this one thing in favor of the movie even if it's trash, at least it's unique, uncompromising trash.

Although the screenplay isn't explicitly a fantasy or a fable, it seems to be set in an alternate world where walls and gardens and backgrounds scream and vibrate with color and icons and swirling shapes, to the point where it is sometimes difficult to actually pay attention to the actors. Sights and sounds are cranked up to the point of absurdity and I tend to finish his films feeling as if I'd been forced to take peyote and then roll strapped in a wheelchair through a MOMA exhibition with my eyelids propped open by toothpicks.I'm OK with that though. Sometimes you want something subtle and creepy, and sometimes you just want the movie to grab you by the throat and shake you until your teeth rattle like castanets.Yes, the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense in spots, and yes, things are being done for shock value alone, and no one is going to award the screenplay a Nobel prize for literature...but damn, this movie is an experience that every devoted horror fan should try to see at least once.

If you are like me you might be sitting there wondering whether or not to watch this flick. It took me a long time to do it because the description didn't really grab me and the reviews I read here were confusing me. I thought it might be some dreadful 70's horror dreck that has a cult following just because it's awful. Some of the negative reviews I read here were so scathing it was really putting me off. But I kept seeing it being recommended at other sites so I decided to get more pro-active about my research. I followed the profile links for every single person who hated this movie and random links of profiles for those who loved it (there were far more of the latter so I couldn't check em all). My goal was to see what other movies they liked or hated to see where they were coming from & where they fitted with my tastes. And honestly, once I did that and realised what kind of people hated or loved this flick, I didn't hesitate to rush out and find Suspiria to watch it. I honestly suggest you do the same. Not just for this movie but for any other. The profile of the reviewer tells you a lot more than the review itself sometimes.Anyway - I cant add much to the plethora of positive reviews here already except to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wish I'd taken the plunge to watch it sooner. It's rich colours, vivid stylistic murder scenes (and yes dear negative reviewers - they are MEANT to look stylistic), uncanny soundtrack and finely honed camera work will stay in my mind for ever. I love how Argento is able to create tension and dread out of the most ordinary things, never letting up, keeping his audience as wide-eyed and keyed up as the characters in his story. This is the third Argento film I have watched having only just discovered this amazing Director, the others being Tenebre and Phenomenon. I actually enjoyed Phenomenon slightly more than Suspiria - I think it has a richer plot line, better characters and slightly more accessible screenplay (by Argento's standards anyway) which is why I gave Suspiria 9 and Phenomena a rare 10. If you're new to Argento Phenomenon might be a better movie to start your discovery process with. But Suspiria is also brilliant. Just in a different, even more off-beat kinda way.A brilliant twisted suspense-filled horror fable full of awesome camera work, fascinating metaphor & cultural symbolism that will keep you on the edge of your seat and mesmerised at the same time. If you consider yourself to be any kind of movie lover and especially if you're a fan of horror you can't afford to let this one pass you by. Simple as that.

Having established himself as a name in the giallo genre (an Italian detective story-cum-proto slasher) with the likes of the awesome 'Profondo Rosso', Argento teamed up with his partner Daria Nicolodi to craft a supernatural thriller suffused with lavish Italian cinematography and a glorious Grand Guignol approach to cinematic kills&#x85;all set to a pumping, haunting rock-opera soundtrack.The film is the first part in Argento's Three Mothers trilogy (the other parts being 'Inferno' (1980) and 'The Mother of Tears' (2007)) and follows Suzy Bannion (played to deer-in-the-headlights perfection by Harper) as she arrives in Germany to attend a famous dance academy. The excessive art nouveau stylings (a masterstroke of set design) of the labyrinthine academy and bold use of Mario Bava-esque colouring immediately usher Suzy (and the viewer) into a surreal atmosphere which, in its sheer over-the-topness, achieves a kind of hysterical Gothic expressionism akin to Whale's 'The Old Dark House' (1932) except with Edvard Munch as interior designer. Populating this odd milieu are the staff and dancers - all of whom accentuate the already bizarre environment with their odd and disconcerting mannerisms. The oddness continues as people are off-ed in some imaginative set-pieces which motivate Suzy to investigate the academy where she unearths its occult history before coming face-to-face with the Mother of Sighs.However, while the lavish set design, use of colour, and rampaging score effectively disorientate the viewer with a full-on sensory assault, some criticise the movie for being more style than substance and this is kind-of understandable as the acting and dialogue are a bit patchy and the plot was nothing new even in 1977 (after all, by this time we had already had such supernatural horror landmarks as 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' (1973) as well as the brutal and wholly un-supernatural 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974)). This point is underscored by the fact that, whilst loving 'Suspiria', it would be remiss if I didn't mention that it didn't scare me so much as remind me of being scared. What's more, it reminded me of being scared by past nightmares rather than anything real. This said, like a good Gothic novel, the hysterics (which in a cinematic context would include set design, cinematography, and score) are what it's all about and thus style and substance are fused and (at least for me) patchy acting and dialogue become absolved. Maybe some would be less forgiving, but I found the demonic hallucinatory quality of 'Suspiria' so well-crafted that disbelief was easily suspended and I was rewarded with an air of disquiet and Gothic derangement evocative of my childhood, hammer horror infused, nightmares.So, flaws there may well be, but despite the influence 'Suspiria' has had on generations of horror movies since, it still manages to stand apart as a singular entity which, like the storm at the start of the movie, will sweep you up and let you freefall into a dizzying descent into occult, dreamlike claustrophobia.

Suspiria, on the other hand is a movie so original and bizarre that it defies all anticipations, for better or for worse. You can tell right from the beginning that Dario Argento tried really hard to achieve something unique with the interesting setting of a prestigious ballet school in Germany as his foundation. Here we get to follow aspiring dancer Suzy Bannion who stumbles into a nightmarish panorama of frightening colors and strange phenomena when she comes to the conclusion that the female employees are in fact witches; evil sorcerers who create misfortune for nothing else than their sadistic needs. As far as the storyline goes, Suspiria fares rather well, relying on its originality rather than any kind of complexity. Witches are rare antagonists even in the horror genre, so any culprits other than unnaturally strong human beings, zombies and vampires provide a refreshing breeze that disobeys the norm. Characterization is another important criteria but I fear that the nature of the movie itself is far too bizarrely different for a proper assessment; in short, none of the characters are ever able to leave their one-dimensional realms even for the shortest of moments, but nor do they actually need to. Suzy, the protagonist herself, is incredibly hard to describe without using the word bland, but then again that was probably the only point of her character; a mundane girl with stereotypically female interests thrown into a bloodstained fairy tale of frightening proportions. Likewise, most of the other characters only embody one or arguably a few characteristics that don't really make for any deeper explorations.The writing suffers from slightly more troublesome problems; Dario originally intended the story to star young children of around 12. When the idea was rejected and the ages of the characters were raised, he didn't make any adjustments to the script. In other words, what we get are young adults who behave like they're still in their pre-teens. While we're on the subject I might also add that most of the dialog was not recorded whilst shooting with creates a certain delay that's highly noticeable and equally annoying; not to mention that it makes the already mediocre actors come off as severely worse.With all this said, are there any redeeming qualities to find in this movie? Sure there are. You can explain it in very accurate manners to almost anyone and they won't fall for it. Suspiria is incredibly hard to sell since it basically boils down into a visual and auditory experience where the primary importance lies in what you can see and the music you hear. As far as cinematography goes, an eerie atmosphere of strong colors and creepy shadows is achieved with limited effort but almost limitless effect. Enhanced by the insanely freaky and above all else bizarre soundtrack that emphasizes strange noises more than any melodies, the result is nightmarish. The viewer feels like he stumbled right into a fairy tale or dream-scape so mesmerizing and occasionally pretty that he finds it a lot easier to ignore logical inconsistencies (of which there are plenty) and scenes that suffer from poor execution.A lot has been said about this movie. It's been called a masterpiece, overrated trash and hauntingly creepy art. In the end, it requires you to forgive several flaws that are well worth forgiving with the insanely original and atmospheric viewing it provides. Whether or not you end up enjoying it might even be a question of minor irrelevance; it's going to be an interesting watch regardless of your personal opinion.

In fact, a lot of it probably had to do with dubbing upon release in America.The entire movie left me unsettled throughout, and like I said, much of that had to deal with the color and sound.

Well you do, but that would spoil it. The story line is OK for the film, but really doesn't have the suspense it needed to give a dynamite ending. Jessica Harper plays the main role and does a decent job. There are many side characters and they split with good and bad acting. There are many funny scenes in the film that you have to pay attention to see. For example, there is a pool in the school. Harper and another girl swim in shorts and a shirt. Why they didn't let them wear suits, I don't know. But the funny thing is that all they wore were shirts and you can easy see through them. The music for the film was played by a group called The Goblins. This definitely gave the film a spooky feel. You would hear the music and it would make it feel like Halloween.

Not on Blu-Ray, but on a DVD from Anchor Bay, it has very vibrant textures and a beautiful scenery to go along. I've never seen blood itself be so red in a movie. The opening to this movie is the highest point. Its very brutal and an intro to a highly appealing Horror flick. Being an Italian movie, and having minimal knowledge of those movies, I had no idea what I was in for. An all out mess of blood and guts? Some of the creepiest and strangest deaths to my knowledge? Or a tamer film since it was made in '77? Heres what I got.Having only seen one Dario Argento's newer films a while back called Mother of Tears I wasn't sure if he had changed his styles from 1977 to 2008. It seems like he has a bit, but still kept the 70s and 80s blood flowing. While Suspiria is a little off balance for me as far as Horror goes, its interesting flow and unique blend of Drama and Horror is interesting, while being redundant at points. I consider it creepy, at times, but at points the dialog gets tiresome and almost dragging on. I realize in 1977 everything couldn't be just killing, stabbing, slashing, murdering, burying, action all around. But sometimes the dialog scenes last so long and it goes sometimes twenty minutes without a scare, I forget Im watching a Horror film. The dialog is a bit too much here, but still effective.Suzy Bannion (Jennifer Harper) is a naive girl who is now in Munich to attend a once in a lifetime opportunity at a dance academy in the town of Freiburg. Suzy is greeted the next morning after her arrival by (Joan Bennett, in her last film role) and Miss Tanner (Alida Valli). Upon seeing a girl named Pat the night before, Suzy is told something by her she is unable to remember the next day. Suzy continues to meet and greet other members of the dance, but when she sees weird, beyond abnormal events occurring in the academy. She believes that witches may inhabit the place and she may not be so much in control.The plot is pretty simplistic, but Argento bends it enough to throw some nice twists in there. Dario Argento is not a horrible director, just not my favorite. Don't get me wrong, his work here is a million times better than the remakes nowadays, but he is just not my favorite director. Different strokes for different folks applies here and I know people treat Argento with respect, which should be the case since he is one of the few classic and very well done Horror directors left. But I think since so much garbage has came out over the years Argento has been a bit overpraised, not saying he's bad, just overpraised.While Suspiria does deliver some very vile scenes for being done in 1977, it does deliver a little too much dialog. I love dialog, Im all about it, but seeing it in a Horror movie, where the dialog is unappealing wears on me quickly. I like it in a lot of things, but not so much in Horror movies. The dialog is slow paced and droning in parts. Not that its bad, just grows tiring after a while. Especially after a huge opening scene and very cool effects and colors hit the screen, I expect a handful of more unique scenes.The films biggest boom, is the music. The synth music by Goblin and Argento himself is beyond words outstanding. It comes at the right times and leaves at the best. The synths composed for Suspiria alone are mind-blowing and excited. I've always said that music in movies usually adds to the excitement, joy, laughter, horror, suspense, etc feeling of said project. In Suspiria, its here it at full force. If remakes/movies nowadays used synths like the ones in this project, they would all earn themselves an extra star.A remake is confirmed and set for a 2012 release which is just a pathetic, bad idea. Suspiria in 2012 will not work. It may have the same plot as the 1977 version, but in no possible way will it have a better cast, idea, background, or music than the 1977 version. Suspiria doesn't need to be remade. Why remake what is already close to perfect, why change the already very well done? Aren't the purpose of remakes to make something better, if that was the case, every remake ever made in the history of movies has failed. No remake is better than the original, all are inferior. Remakes may have the same plot, not the same feel or suspense brought in the original.Suspiria is the Horror gem of the 70s and while going on to achieve a rating of cult classic will now have me as a proud watched. Much thanks to user No Personality for recommending it to me. I will watch more Argento in the future, and hopefully, the sequel Inferno will impress just as equally as this.Starring Jessica Harper, Udo Kier, Joan Bennett, and Alida Valli.

Placed in a remote location just outside of town and surrounded by woods the school is set in an old eerie building saturated with colour (naturally mostly in Argento's beloved red). On the night of her arrival to Germany in the midst of a great thunderstorm she is locked out of the school, whilst at the same time witnessing a seemingly terrified fellow American flee it . That same night the American is murdered (in one stunning and memorable murder scene)... The following morning Susan finally enrols into the school only for the more mystery and terror to persist...Dario Argento's masterpiece is in many ways perfect. This especially concerns the tone in which the movie is filmed and the never-subsiding suspense, which makes this movies extremely creepy despite never really offering much visual shockers (and one quite terribly poor bat attack scene). Permeating in red and blue hue the whole movie has an unmistakable feel to it that has become Argento's trademark. And as such the whole film together with the remarkable blooming set-pieces is a visual masterpiece with certain scenes and shots guaranteed to remain in memory long after the movie itself has been forgotten.The main reason I however forfeited on giving the movie a higher mark has most to do with the story itself. I was never a great fan of Argento's stories and scripts - often extremely rudimentary and leaving a sense of being highly underdeveloped or even rushed. Characters are also very underdeveloped and the poor acting coupled with sub-par dubbing never helps. In the case of Suspiria the mystery behind the killings keeps you on the edge of the seat for most of the film, but in the end the final act and the resolving of the story leaves you deeply unsatisfied. Would love to give a bigger shout out to Argento for his most important film, but I am unable to ignore to deeply disappointing plot to the otherwise terrific movie.Additional kudos for the tremendous lead musical motiff recorded by The Goblins.

Not only has he revived them, but also has given them a new dimension. Suspiria is one of Argento's best creations. It is art-horror at it's best. I call it colorful brutality. We get scared after watching the victims throat get slashed but we also do not fail to appreciate the colorful & artful background where the victim was murdered. In Suspiria, the first murder itself makes us appreciate the genius of the filmmaker. It is one of the finest killing I have seen in cinema. Most of the movie takes place under one location - The ballet school and hence Argento has given special attention in creating its own separate personality. Background music is exceptional by Goblin.The one thing which I hated about the movie though was it's bad acting and terrible dubbing.But I am not aware if Argento movies are known for their good acting anyways.

Suspiria, much considered his finest, is almost an opera of a horror film, unlike anything else from it's time (except Argento's other film's). Even today, it is extremely distinctive, and although I am probably among the world's last of horror fans to feast my eyes on it, if there is anyone else who has not seen it, go for it.American cutey Susan Bannion hops across the pond to attend the famous TAM ballet academy in Rome. The place is moderately friendly but also unusual. as the nights progress tediously, Strange signs lead Suzy to suspect that there may be witchcraft a foot in the place.The plot is actually pretty thin, but it doesn't feel that way. Suspiria is stretched out slowly, and while it's scariness is middling at best, Argento successfully makes the whole thing feel very subjective, subtle and fragile, as if life hangs by a thread. Argento's vision is a highly eccentric manipulation of colour, shape, and sounds intended of course to provoke the feeling of being in a haunted house, which is just as eerie during the day as it is during the night. These sets would be a great place to stage a music video, among other things. Suspiria has much to offer for anyone who gives it a try, I doubt if it will scare the pants off you, but then again, that is not really the film main intention. It is an experiment in the art's and crafts of cinematic design and it's result are more than satisfactory.

Settling in at the academy proves increasingly difficult, as she is greeted with bizarre noises and even stranger occurrences, eventually realising that the establishment is a facade concealing a dark world of sinister witchcraft, in which throat slashings are commonplace.Hailed as a European horror classic, Suspiria's bloody charm resides in its technical triumphs and visual style. Argento's skillful use of unsettling, intense colour and stunning set designs adequately obscure the film's numerous structural flaws. Death is portrayed with aesthetic abandon - most memorable is the scene where one woman in a negligee escapes a predator by crawling through a window, only to tumble onto a mat of razor wire. Argento's confident conjuring of hallucinatory terror and all-pervading evil sends a spell-binding chill through every frame. The bloody mark of a fine horror picture.

I mean that, really. I make note of the fact that not only is Suspiria an incredibly well-made horror film (considering its budget and the reputation of slasher movies in general), but it's actually scary. All this has to do with the unconventional direction of Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, who up until watching Suspiria for the first time in its entirety a few nights ago, I only knew by reputation - not by film (though I am aware that he collaborated with George A. Romero on my favorite horror movie of all time - 1978's Dawn of the Dead).His 1977 Suspiria is arguably his best and most well-known horror film. Incredibly enough, much of what makes this movie scary is not because of the usual theatrics usually associated with run-of-the-mill slasher flicks - masked and/or unseen killer, scantily-clad sexy lead heroine and other like-dressed female associates, just plain dumb characters who abide by the rules of slasher movies, buckets and buckets of gore, ominous music, etc. While Suspiria uses elements of all these (and would in turn influence subsequent horror films in the United States), they are, to be precise, merely tools at Argento's disposal - they're not the film's driving force.That is to say that Suspiria is probably the most frightening-sounding movie ever made. I'm deadly serious about that last statement. No movie has made me more at unease due to the combination of the use of its soundtrack (by the Italian band Goblin), sound effects, and general use of sound than Suspiria. This is really where Argento shines as a director here - through his use of sound and music, and the mayhem that many times ensues whenever/wherever it's employed. And there is some pretty surreal and frightening imagery to boot.But too bad the film's plot doesn't match the effect of its soundtrack. To some, that's a bad thing. But in the giallo genre (the Italian word for yellow, and is also the mystery/thriller style of storytelling popular in Argento's native Italy), this IS a good thing, style and atmosphere over plot and characters. The plot is insanely simple and almost episodic in nature the film's central character is American ballet dancer Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper), who enrolls at a prestigious European dance academy and discovers along with her roommate and fellow dancer Sara (Stephania Casina), that the place is run by a coven of witches.As stated earlier, all of this secondary to Argento's use of sound, color, imagery, and music. I've never before been so effectively creeped out by a movie's soundtrack before, nor have I ever seen such prominent use of music before to scare the hell out of the audience. Two of the film's most frightening and surreal moments involves a blind man in the darkness of a vacant square, and Sara being pursued through the dance academy's labyrinthine hallways by an unseen, knife-wielding maniac. Combined with the film's dreamy atmosphere, these two sequences come to stand out in a movie that ultimately plays out like some vivid nightmare come to horrifying life.With all this mind, it immediately separates Suspiria from the rest of the crop of horror flicks as being something truly unique to the genre. I can assure you that is not to say that all other horror films I've seen dim in comparison to this film, but I'm just commenting on how different Argento's style of direction is when compared to some of his peers. It certainly makes for quite a viewing experience.Suspiria is unquestionably one of the most uniquely frightening horror films I've ever seen. Dario Argento has made a horror flick that is most certainly hard to compare to and I can say that I have found a new horror favorite. This film is also shockingly gory and violent (its outbursts of violence are so sudden and infrequent that they're actually quite horrifying), blandly acted (which is not so bad, after all), and just plain scary. This movie is not just a thriller or a slasher.This movie is Suspiria.10/10 "},{"Title":"Witchery","Date":"27 February 2010","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" For my money, SUSPIRIA is Argento's greatest work.

There are two outstanding death scenes a blind man walking with his seeing eye dog is abruptly attacked by the dog. And a ballet student ends up falling into a room full of razor wire.

The same applies to the cinematography and its multiple cycles of reds and blues to create atmosphere.The plot was nothing new even in 1977, basically Rosemary's Baby set in a girls' school only without the baby nor even a motive. Hammer Films themselves had already beat this dead horse to a pulp years before.Go ahead and rent though if you are a die-hard horror fan or a film student as the film does have bits of creative genius, however the sum adds up to much less than the whole.

The scenes are decadently enhanced by artificial colored lights and an unsettling orchestration that is by far the most chilling soundtrack I've heard in a horror movie. The acting was mediocre, but I feel like the amateur and sometimes humorous portrayals, added a certain depth and feel that otherwise wouldn't have worked. The cinematography is brilliant. At times I felt as though I was looking at an I Spy book. There was always something more to look at, but not so much that it was impossible to catch. All of this combined with the rich Italian architecture, make for a seriously thought-provoking film. I couldn't shake the scenes for weeks later. Though the plot didn't add up, I was unable to stop myself from feeling an unusual sort of fear. It's all the more frightening because I honestly did not know what to be afraid of. If you're a stickler for fine-tuned films, then I would not recommend this.

This film clearly displays Argento fantastic visual style, his attention to detail and his way of telling a story visually, rather then through dialog. The film is the most beautiful film I have ever seen, as it was shot on Eastman Color Kodak stock and was printed using the 3-strip Technicolor process, giving it an 3-D effect. This film stands as not only a monument to the genius of Argento but the film's photographer Luciano Tovoli.Dario Argento influences culminate in this, his sixth film. It can clearly be noted that his main influence was his mentor, Mario Bava (Black Sunday). Argento made Bava's famous tracking shot his own, and this has become one of Argento's many signatures.People say that Suspiria does not have a plot, but it does, although it is a simple one. I think it is genius of Argento not to focus to much on plot, as the audience will probably be trying to figure the story out if the plot for Suspiria was complex, therefore, they would pay little attention to how visual stunning Suspiria is, and this would sour the experience of watching Suspiria.The acting in Suspiria I adored.

I saw this film back to back with Deep Red and became totally perplexed as to the hype of Argento. All these fans and talented filmmakers whom I respect love the man's body of work and I don't. Is there something wrong with me? I wondered. Now that I'm a little older, and maybe a little wiser, I understand the dreamlike qualities of Dario Argento's films. Suspiria is an iconic fairy tale horror film and the first fifteen minutes are unbelievable. It's very gorgeous and uber-violent. And Goblin's score is nothing short of brilliant in its simplicity. The moans and whispers are very eerie and compliment Argento's visuals perfectly. The movie just doesn't completely work for me on a basic storytelling level, and that's okay. It's a much better film than I ever gave it credit for being, but I still loathe Deep Red. Although Suspiria didn't quite live up to its hype, and Deep Red was god awful, I would later fall in love with Tenebre. So I do encourage you to watch his films, especially if you're into nightmarish visuals that don't weave together in a traditional fashion.

Sure, I've seen hundreds of stalking/chase scenes, hundreds of suspense scenes, hundreds of action sequences involving hundreds of stunts and effects and I'm dozing off in many films. Argento makes his sets, the lighting, the camera all characters in themselves, and thus finds a way to keep his scenes both interesting and intense when he wants them to be.I slept through XXX; I was afraid to blink in Suspiria.Argento is not afraid to let the camera linger, to slowly follow characters as they creep down his elaborate sets, and leave the audience suspended from one perspective for long periods of time. Thanks to the new wave of epileptic-cutting style (Hollywood) film-making brought on by the invention of Avids, I'd nearly forgotten how much more tension, how much more suspense, and how much more interesting a scene can play from an elite handful points of view with strategic cuts.As far as style goes this is, hands down, my favorite horror picture, and the only thing holding it back from being my favorite horror film is the dialogue and some of the characters' childishness. Yes, I have read from more than one source the reason behind this, but it still really irritates me - coming from the mouths of these actors, it makes their characters come across as a bit dimwitted and also as a cheap way of spelling out the plot. From the mouths of children; however, it would be appropriate and perfectly acceptable.I want to rave endlessly about the magic of Argento's use of the frame - how he sets up his death sequences, wonderful use of extreme close ups juxtaposed to extreme distanced shots, a wonderful zoom that starts on two characters talking and finishes on their reflection, Goblin's classic score, and how Argento paints the screen with blues, reds, greens, with masterful precision to direct your eye to his focal points, but I'd be wasting my breath because this is a film that must be experienced firsthand.

His direction adds to the thrill of his movies, but not as much as his use of color and sound. The over powering musical score and sound coming from movement of the characters or the settings help make the horror come alive. The use of color also brings a feel and a look to the movie that no other film maker has reproduced since. Suspiria is loved or hated by today's audience. It will either rank high or low by today's audience standards. In my opinion, the movie has its moments but falls apart in many scenes. The script and story fail to keep my attention. Too many people whispering about something that is obvious, but still confusing to the audience lacks character and drive. The script has several holes that remain unfilled by the close of the movie.The direction is slow at times but picks up in the right areas. Still, besides the terrific use of color and sound, Suspiria falls short of anything terrific. A classic for its time, the movie sits on the shelves at the local video store, waiting to be watched. A cover of dust blocks the title on its box cover.

This is especially true of the late Seventies, early Eighties where slasher movies had some mainstream acceptance. Moviemakers sometimes strived to deliver the blood without much thought to anything else. So where does &#145;Suspiria' fit into this &#150; sublime or ridiculous? When the movie is given some serious thought, the answer is not quite as simple as one would have thought it should have been. This is largely due to Dario Argento &#150; a well-known figure in horror. His complexities of character overrun this movie as he instinctively performs his task of directing. Below I shall outline some of the salient factors within the fabric of his foremost creation, which give it its place in the horror genre.The first thing that strikes you is Argento's use of images and sound to create atmosphere. This is seen from the outset where Suzy arrives at the airport into a downpour with creepy music as a backdrop. She has now entered the world of the unnatural - unnatural evil. It is the lair of a dark foreboding force waiting for the next victim. The conditions are cold and the people even colder. We also see close-ups of water pouring down drains, something that is used throughout the movie as he attempts to create an illusion of the bloodletting and loss of life.Even more striking is the architectural settings that are used. It is like Old Europe meeting Picasso and it is quite breathtaking. This is a signature of almost every Italian directed film that I've seen. It was evident in &#145;The Ninth Gate' thus accentuating the illusion of book readers having refined tastes and in &#145;Dracula' to give an indication of the ancient, dark evil that he is. The advantage here is that the story is easier to become engrossed in. The senses are fully engaged as the settings add real value to the storyline. Another world is created and we are not put off by realistic settings that can jolt you from the story.The use of lighting is strongly emphasised by other users here and quite rightly so. Not only does it reflect the evil personality of the clan, but it also gives evil life to the dwellings. There was deliberate intent here that is proven by the death of the Black Queen, which causes the school to explode. This is a clever tactic since the majestic settings' thoroughly engages the imagination and our heroine is not only against the shapeshifting entities, but the whole complex itself. If we go to a place of splendour, we can feel the vibe that it gives &#150; it seems to have a life of it's own - and the shrewd camera technique takes full advantage of this.The setting for the blind mans demise is a perfect example of this. The courtyard has an effect of foreboding power and when alone you could feel overwhelmed by the magnanimous aura. This effect is fully exploited by Argento. The sense of ever-present evil is also created by the set where they go to sleep away from the maggots. The blood &#150; red lighting that awash the sheets and walls is indicative of the intent of the not only of the horde, but of the school building. This setting becomes all the more macabre when we learn of the Directresses (The Black Queen) presence.On the subject of the blind mans demise, it is also where one of the weak points of the movie is evident. The effects stand out as very weak to an audience used to high &#150; tech CGI. This will be a problem for most movies of this time period as advancements create realistic effects. We can easily see the fake blood and the mannequin. Even though the scene stands out as a truly gruesome murder scene, an Argento signature, this will diminish with time, as effects become more seamless.      One thing that is inescapable here, is the deep &#150; set misogynist element. This is overwhelmingly evident in the first and third murder scene where the victims suffering is drawn out and vicious at the same time. In the first one she is methodically and brutally stabbed instead of an all out knife assault which would have resulted in a quicker death. Argento even uses his own arm in these scenes to deliver the lethal blows. A slow death is the worst kind of death and that is meticulously planned here. As if this was not enough, she is hung for all to see with another woman creatively impaled below.In the third murder scene, the woman seems to seductively ensnare herself in the barbed wire thus causing more suffering. Indeed Argento's complex personality is laid to bear in scenes like this. Also one of the witches conjures up an image of a Frau Blitzen who teased the weak boys at physical training class.      As a lead - up to the first murder scene another shrewd ploy was used and that is of the presence at the window. The sensation of a presence draws in the frightened woman who looks but then draws away. But her curiosity gets the better of her as she is now driven by her fears &#150; a fear not uncommon to many members of the audience. The hanging clothes block her vision accentuating the effect of something hiding. Suddenly she is attacked through the window and the vicious assault begins. This scene with the assistance of surreal music and a room visually vibrant is one that will stay long with the audience.Another camera trick used has its roots in Edgar Allan Poe. The wine glass is lifted to the camera as if we were drinking. This is an attempt to instil us in Argento's symphony of terror &#150; much like Poe used to do.Italians seem to lay their souls to bare for their chosen art form. Perhaps a part of the emotive make &#150; up as they draw on all their senses to deliver a product to satisfy their particular artistic tastes. This is fortunate for movie fans. The camera work, lighting and music have already been mentioned, but sometimes this will not do when the required effect is necessary. In the first murder scene, an animal heart is stabbed. In the third murder scene, it looks like a chicken breast is being slashed in order to simulate a throat being cut. These attempts did not go unnoticed and do take the already gruesome scenes to another level, even if we can tell what has been done.The story is not particularly of note, although I do not believe it is as weak as some say. The climatic scene builds up quite nicely as the heroine is given an insurmountable task, that is, to kill the Black Queen in her own lair. But she delivers one strike and as she perishes, the evil complex starts to disintegrate. For a movie that made its name out of scenes, it should not be the climax that is the let down. For everything to end in thirty seconds certainly went against the grain of the movie.Where exactly this movie fits was not easily determined. But it was the creative use of sets, lighting and sound that ultimately elevates this movie above most in the genre. Any true horror must have this in collection. Cheap thrills were not the norm here as we are spellbindingly drawn into a wicked, cruel world of parasitic witches drawing their evil power from the weak and unwitting. Although there is ominous motivations in the make &#150; up of some scenes, there is no doubting Argento's talent and the contribution he has made to the genre. While you are reading this, I am probably searching for &#145;Tenebre'. I believe that there is an axe murder scene like no other. If Picasso did murder, perhaps it would be something like this.

This is one of them. The first time I saw this was on the big screen in 1977. It has never left me. I didn't know who Dario Argento was then but I became a cautious fan after my initial viewing. And yet, much as I have a fondness for this film and am compelled to watch it again, I tend to dwell a bit before taking the dive. The first minutes of the film are indeed anxiety inducing. At first it looked like the legendary 'snuff' films we've all heard so much about. Very disturbing and yet somehow beautiful. I didn't like what I was feeling. Cool! It occurs to me as it has to many of the other reviewers that this just might be ART. Since I have indeed taken the plunge a few more times and endured this flick, I agree. It is.The colors of the sets - tongue red, bile blue, gall bladder green. Ew! The colors are beautiful in the way they unbalance you with their vivid gaudiness. Shadows Caligarically cast darkened scars across the walls, furniture, and, of course, the players. The rain shadows on the red walls - good visual idea.The acting wasn't bad - but it wasn't great either. At least it wasn't quite what I expected. All of the effort that seemed to be put toward establishing character in the characters was wasted. A lot of whispering. I didn't establish sympathy for any character. I was scared for most of them. After that opening scene I just assumed everyone involved was merely meat waiting to be harvested. So I detached. The story isn't hard to follow but doesn't necessarily follow logic either. There are nightmarish dreamlike qualities to many of the scenes. Logic doesn't have to prevail because no matter what you do, you are doomed. This leaves the viewer even more upset and unbalanced. Often this is a good thing to get from a horror movie, n'est ce-pas? The ending was a touch more abrupt than I would have liked. You are kind of dropped - so there.Now the music - wow. What a noise. Very voodooish and somewhat haunting. It builds and builds. Hypnosis sets in. You know something is going to happen but, man, getting there can be real suspenseful-like. Frequently the soundtrack overwhelms what is actually going on. You have to wonder whether that wasn't done on purpose. I think it was because the effect worked on me. All you can do is stare at the carnage. Neat!At the end of the day this movie is like a craving. You want to see it but not necessarily have to go through until you're ready. There are maggots beneath the skin of this film. It is definitely worth seeing as a film student. If you like horror films with a bit of gore that could also be called art - this is the movie for you. I liked it but I can never guarantee when I am going to be compelled to see it again.

Then the monster drops in and terrorizes our victims; they get chased and we get 'scared'.  Various happenings in the plot where things we didn't know before get revealed try to keep up interested.  And so it goes.  I think Stephen King's got a how-to book that explains how to do all this stuff, if you're interested...Suspiria, if you haven't seen the movie or heard anything about it, doesn't exactly work like that, or even try to.  'Atmosphere' is not even the right word- it's more like a shared hallucination.  The plot is criticized even by the movie's supporters; personally, I think it might have done the movie service if all explanations had been done away with altogether (then you'd _really_ read some howling reviews from people who wasted their money). I wouldn't exactly call it scary, but I don't know that I've ever really been literally scared by any movie since I was about ten or so.  I will say it's an unmatched experience, and one of the few horror movies that I return to again and again.  It's a rare breed of movie, and in its breed, it's really the best we've got.So, to wrap up, I won't exactly pass on a recommendation to the reader. If you're the kind of person that needs to see this movie, you'll probably end up seeing it, but if you want a safe bet for a rental or purchase, try a safer movie.

I caught onto him only a few years ago.  However his film Tenebre is among my favorites along with Profondo Roso and this one Suspiria.  The typical horror fan may never understand this film, just as a typical film fan may not either.  I have heard so many people make fun of the over dramatic sequences in the film.  I have heard a lot about the color of the blood.  I have heard even more about the eyes in the window.  So many people have lost their ability to think in an abstract sense that the world's art has gone to dung over the years.   In Suspiria, Argento paints a picture.  He has been the only person who has been able to put on film the way we all see things when we are afraid.  When we are afraid we do not pay attention to the details simply because we are in a euphoric state of mind.  Fear is the greatest boost of adrenaline anyone can receive.  Fear unto itself is like a drug, it can give us a very abnormal view on our surroundings.  Don't you remember the shadows of your teddy bears when you were children, becoming monsters?  Don't you remember seeing things that could never possibly move do the impossible?  That is the abstract idea of the famous words There is nothing to fear but fear itself.  The point is when we are afraid our minds become playgrounds for extreme paranoia to the point of delusion.  You can scare yourself with your mind more than any person can.     That being said, although nobody will ever truly capture fear, and make you feel the same fear; Dario Argento has found a way for us to explore the beauty and ugliness of fear.  Thus far, he has been the only director in film history to scratch the surface in capturing the essence of true fear.  Suspiria is the film that displays it better than any other film.  If you like Suspiria check out all of Argento's work.  Argento is thus far, the only director to have never disappointed me.  Hopefully anyone new to Argento will feel the same.  Warning however, cynics need to stay away from this film.  While there are many spots in this film that can come off to non-abstract thinkers, (You know who you are, people who like the box office hits, and Academy award winners), poking fun at this film will only make you seem more ignorant than you probably are.  If you don't get it don't poke at it, just go watch Jaws, Psycho, or Scream and everything will be ok.  You will have return to the land of Hubba Bubba dreams!Suspiria  10 crows of 10, slaughtered and beautifully arranged.

If you approach this film expecting it to be a horror movie in the same model as Scream, A Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween, you'll be sorely disappointed, as Suspiria is a much stronger assault on the viewers' senses, and makes no attempt to conform to the rules of the genre.Suspiria is more or less a fairytale. Many classic gothic elements are present throughout, such as the main character, Suzy, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Snow White. She arrives in Freiburg in Germany in the middle of a massive thunderstorm, planning on studying at the famous Dance Academy. Upon reaching the academy, she witnesses another girl running out, screaming incoherently, and is subsequently told by voice on the intercom to get lost. Within a short amount of time, we see the runaway girl and a friend with whom she is staying meet their end in one of the most original and brutal murders ever to be filmed. As disturbing things continue to happen in and around the school, Suzy becomes more and more aware that what appears to be a respectable dance academy is actually a cover-up for occult worship...Little is explained about what's happening. For example, the first girl to die (Pat) is killed by an unseen assailant with large, hairy arms. We never find out who the killer is. In fact, we never find out who any of the killers are. We know (eventually) that it is the witches that are making these things happen, but we don't know who the actual perpetrators are. But in a way, does anything need to be explained? Bad things don't necessarily happen for a reason the impression I am under is that the witches are simply intent on spreading evil and destruction, with little motivation.This is definitely one of the most incredible looking films I have ever seen. The colors are completely surreal, with bright reds, blues and yellows lighting many of the scenes. I suspect that these colors are used to suggest the presence of evil; yet, the characters don't seem to be aware of them. Blood is bright red, but this adds to the style rather than detracting from it. The whole story is so unbelievable anyway that it's perfectly normal to accept that blood is bright red and looks a lot like thick paint.I also have to mention the incredible music by the group Goblin. The simple theme tune that is repeated throughout the movie is quite similar to the one John Carpenter composed for Halloween, but in my opinion this score is far and away the better of the two. The hypnotic soundtrack is filled with barely-decipherable screams and chants, the best example being the word Witch! which is frequently hissed, especially during the opening scenes.Let's be fair, the actual story is pretty far-fetched, and some of the dialogue and acting is laughable. This isn't helped by the fact that almost the entire film was recorded silent, and dubbed later (a process that many Italian filmmakers continued right up until the mid 1980s). However, this doesn't seem to matter. The visuals and aurals, and the genuine atmosphere and heavy stylization, completely mask the scenario deficits. That's why I'm giving this movie FIVE STARS because it completely works within context. It has faults, yes, but its pros make up for its cons, completely dazzling you. Forget Halloween, forget Scream, you MUST see Suspiria.Overall 9 out of 10 "},{"Title":"So much potential is lost on uninspiring characters","Date":"19 April 2003","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  Like many other IMDB reviewers I have heard this movie mentioned frequently as one of the scariest of all time.  Not until recently have I delved into the Euro-Horrors, and even though I wasn't impressed by Argento's Demons, I figured I would give this movie a shot.I have seen many a horror movie, and I have to say that the musical score by Goblin is by far, one of the best horror scores of all time.  Yes, it deserves a place right up there with Carpenter's music (Halloween, The Fog) and it works so well to build the tension, you have to wonder how much more bland the movie would be without it's eerie presence.  Since it is used heavily in the movie, it plays with your psyche.Some of the visuals and architecture in this movie are stunning, and on more than one occasion I pinched myself and told me this wasn't Kubrick, but Argento.  His gratuitous use of Red and other overtoned colors pulls you into the story as if you were watching a fairy tale, the menacing outside shots of the school (looking up at it) make it seem as it's an entity of it's own.  The opening scene in which you see the student running through the dark woods, cloaked in white is unnerving - and when she looks out the window of her room.. the eyes.  Horrifying.  At a few points in the movie, when you first start discovering that the school hides an evil secret, the tension is wonderful.  Fear of the unknown, exploring the footsteps of the teachers and the path which they lead, it definitely preys upon your imagination and will have you clinging to the edge of your seat.  Death could come from anywhere.  Especially beautiful is the courtyard death scene, with ominous architecture peering out of the darkness upon the prey in the center - in the light.So much potential it made me angry that the movie falls apart on so many levels.  To be a psychological horror, you MUST identify with the characters.  You must crawl inside their fear, you must form some sort of emotional bond with them, you have to care whether they live or die.  From the beginning of the movie the pacing seems way off, it's long, drawn out and quite simply boring.  Not until the second half does it start to redeem itself slightlty.  If the plot was worked on, there were better actors and it was edited properly this really could have ranked up there as one of the best horror movies ever made.I won't comment too much on the special effects because I know this was a low budget production, and it was the seventies.  Yes, the bat scene is laughable and painful to watch.  The barbed wire clearly has no razor edges on it.  The dog puppet is ridiculous.  The blood is so fake you swear you were looking at a kool-aid and ketchup composite.  But if you can suspend criticism of pre-CGI special effects and overlook these props it helps.I can't really recommend this movie to the casual horror viewer, because quite frankly they will look past the beautiful cinematic moments and focus on the weak story and bad acting.  But for those of us who also judge movies from an artistic side, there are definitely some pleasures to be had with this film.7 out of 10 for the moments of beauty and tension that could have played out into so much more.

The main complaint seems to be that the story makes no sense, the acting is wooden, and the blood bright red.  These are all correct observations, but most real horror fans will tell you that it is the film's atmosphere that matters.  Ambiance is the whole point of Suspiria.  The set designs are drenched in blazing primary colors; this was done on purpose to create a surreal, dreamlike quality.  The blood is bright red to match the extreme technicolor scheme.  There is little in this film that is lucid, which is its greatest attribute.  Sure, there is a decent plot about witches, but the narrative is PURPOSELY kept at bay to give the viewer a disoriented effect. Some may say Argento is hiding an ineptness in story telling with garish sets and effects, but check out The Bird With the Crystal Plumage or Deep Red(UNCUT), which are very sophisticated murder mysteries.  The dialog is often times generic and is the one thing I can see as a valid complaint; but, it is really there to propel the story and take the viewer further into Argento's funhouse of images. I'll take that over some pretentious horror film that has pedestrian after school special sub-plots and cornball pop as its soundtrack. "},{"Title":"Compelling and makes no sense!

It is a great piece of work from the Italian Master but if you watch closely you will realise it makes no sense. But, the bizarre music, the wild settings, the impossible bit where a killer bursts through a window when there is nothing to hold on to! It is utterly compelling and an unforgettable experience. Jessica Harper plays Susy, a girl who wants to enter a ballet school and realises it is a coven of witches and demons. The gore is bright pink but the killings are suspenseful. It is not a giallo like Argento's other early work but it hints of a possible detective story told instead by the main character and her friends. The camera angles like the pigeons eye view and the presence of someone or something watching Susy and her friend in the swimming pool. It is overall one of Argento's best. I don't like it as much as 'Deep Red' but people will argue over which is the best. I give this 7 out of 10.

The list ended up looking like this1. The Exorcist 2. The Silence of the Lambs 3. Suspiria 4. Halloween 5. Night of the Living DeadNow, why would Suspiria rank so highly on my list? The mainreason was that director Dario Argento's style and visual senseset him in a class that was far beyond any other horror director Ihave ever seen (I categorize Hitchcock in the suspense category).If you watch his set up and choreography of each shot in Suspiria,one can only imagine the time and effort that he took into makingthe shot. The amount of time it took to adjust the lighting just right,to get the actors to move in a certain way in their positions, theplacement of the set designs, the use of the simple, yet effectivemusic, all are executed in this film with such precision andcreativity.If you watch the choreography of the first murder scene, you'llnotice how everything is set up just perfectly within the first minute,using the next to build a sense of dread, the next to clench theaudience in a sense of fear, and that final minute to take thatsense a bit further and show the full brutality of a murder. That'sone thing Argento does well, deglamourizing murder. If you were towatch of the murder scenes in Suspiria, you'll notice howdisturbing they are to watch, but at the same time, how they lookjust fake enough to distance the audience from reality. By doingthis, Argento is able to both repel, but keep us grounded in the factthat the violence in this film is fictional and should not beglamorized.Granted, the characters are never as clearly defined as, say, JodieFoster's in The Silence of the Lambs or Ellen Burstyn in TheExorcist, and there is a good reason for that. By doing this,Argento still maintains that safe distance from the audience, sothe murders seem less glamorous. Also, this allows Argento theability to enter a more surreal universe and create an almoststorybook like surrounding.Overall, the effect of this film is one of complete dread, wheresuspense lurks around every corner of the gothic dance academyand the audience is never quite sure where the attack is going tocome from. This alone should be grounds to make if an aboveaverage horror film. But Argento's style takes it a step further tobecome an icon in the horror film genre.

Argento's later films may be more thematically and narratively complex, but Suspiria still retains a primal power which is missing from his later films.  The reason why it is so scary is because of the intense quiet which pervades so many of the scenes.  I won't say anymore...just watch the movie!

Indeed, the actual plot and characterization in Suspiria was weak, it didn't matter.  Argento's halucinatory fairy tale of a film batters the viewer so successfully with its shocking atmospherics that the film needn't actuallly provide much of a story at all to be terrifying.  The use of color filters, as well as Goblin's unrelenting soundtrack create a nightmarish scenario that draws us to the film.  Argento, like all of the great masters of the genre, is able to coax us into watching, even as we know that something horrible is coming, and then still shock us senseless when the violence comes.  Though Suspiria is a very graphically violent and gory film, one never finds the gore to be exploitative.

An incomplete meditation (Mild Spoiler...)","Date":"6 February 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  With over 110 reviews of this film, I wonder who is going to read this???I skimmed through the reviews and found, not unexpectedly, that with this film most viewers either adore or despise it.  What could I possibly have to add to this glut of praise and blame? Two words with much-too-lengthy-commentaryTerrificly Ambivalent.Dario Argento is credited by some as a master and pioneer of the slasher movie genre. When I was a boy I used to draw a curious distinction between the words horror and terror in classifying films.  A horror film, to my young logic, was one which emphasized a more spiritual, psychological study in fear, more often than not a ghost story of some kind where the peril its characters undergo is often less physical than spiritual (the word horror being somewhat onomatopoeic of the rounded O of a person's mouth, moaning in extreme psychological disturbance).  A terror film, on the other hand, is the classic slasher, violent, shocking, with a focus on the sheer panic mainly of being confronted with someone or something trying to tear (alliterative sense of the word terror) your body apart and the adrenaline-infused yet mainly hopeless attempt to escape.  Well, I feel that Argento's work combines the two, incidentally, and brings to the screen the best and worst of each.I have a terrible attraction/repulsion to Argento's films.  I have never been a big fan of the slasher genre as a whole.  These murder scenes-- vibrant, pulsating, writhing, lingering and terrifically brutal-- arouse in me a cold sweat of squirming moral repulsion.  I contemplate after the movie's pivotal, brilliant scene which ends famously with the desperate and actually somewhat sad (in my opinion it is simply terrifying but there is a distinct undercurrent of human despair) snuffing of the character Sarah Why do I, why would people want to watch something that makes us feel so wretched?I can't honestly give an answer that doesn't contradict some other feeling I have on the issue.  Now typical of the slasher genre is the close-up stabbing shot.  Maybe I'm just still too squeamish to hack it, but it is awfully effective in Argento, and he just doesn't let up.  Just when you NEED relief from the violence, he gives you more, raises the bar.  These types of shots are the kinds of things only the killer would be seeing; for example a throat being slashed.  It is deeply disturbing to be put into that position.  It is the verge of psychological trauma; after the first violent scene (not the one where Sarah is killed but her unfortunately inquisitive friend Pam ?), I was scared the rest of the movie of being made to watch it happen again to someone else.  I BECAME SCARED OF THE FILM, NOT MERELY OF WHAT IT PORTRAYED.  I believe that is the crux of why some view Argento as a master.  He is able to make you fear him, the filmaker, and he does this seemingly quite intentionally with images and sound and the interweaving of both.  It IS sublimely significant, in precisely this way, that in the first scene the killer's arm is actually Mr. Argento's arm.Actually to me that is amazing.  Having recently seen _Suspiria_ for the second time, I now literally dread watching _Deep Red_ for the second time, though I know I will be compelled to do so.I'd love to end on that note, but I also had a brief word on so-called plot.  I admit the script was mediocre as far as nuts-and-bolts dialogue goes, but I admit it only grudgingly because for me it didn't honestly detract.  But I felt that the plot in this movie is more of a theme than a plot; an instance for exploration, and yes, a bit of contemplation.  It's not interesting as a plot, not clever, not shocking or classically suspenseful, but I sense profundity nonetheless.  I'd almost have to go so far as to say this is NOT A STORY, folks, but a thematic musing.  Which goes against those who see in this film all surface, all effects (which is a fairly obvious and fallacious assumption to make about garish lighting and loud music)  There IS substantial content, regardless of the usual observation that the dialogue is cheap and the plot is thin.A love/hate film.  Casts a spell over some viewers.  Some are immune and amused or bored by its failings.7 or so out of 10, give or take.  Could be a ten, could be a zero.  Five isn't adequate.  ;) "},{"Title":"Forget 'the only thing scarier...' tagline, its all scary!!!","Date":"28 January 2002","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  When Dario Argento was born, he was born with a gift, a gift that he decided to share upon the rest of the world through the camera and this film was perhaps the greatest gift to the horror genre.From start to finish Suspiria is a complete assault on the senses from the opening scenes of the rain soaked Black Forest, to the final scenes in the convent. It hits you like the proverbial ten-tonne-truck, and keeps hitting you until the closing credits roll, leaving you emotionally exhausted and absolutely scared out of your wits end, not wanting to look out of the window!!!What really sets this film apart from the rest is the way its shot in an almost dream like way, everything is so bright but yet so clouded.The camera work is top-notch and many of the set pieces are of the highest quality, films like Lucio Fulcis 'The Beyond' have borrowed some of Argentos set pieces all to degreeing effects.As for the acting, well if there is a downside to the film it could be that the script leaves a lot to be desired. But maybe thats because it is such a visual masterpiece that the script would have to be of Oscar standards to top the film. But to be fair, theres not a lot said as most of its shot involving the camera and the actor/ess and rather than have someone jabbering on taking the viewers mind away from whats happening. People don't get scared while someone is talking, they do get scared when the person is running away from some unseen assailant.It can be a little bloody at times, but since when has the murdering of somebody not been bloody, Argento just lingers on the scene a little longer, forcing you to look at whats happened, and be repulsed at it, just in the same way as you would if it was real.The Tagline says 'The only thing scarier than the last 12 minutes are the first 92.' thats wrong, it is all scary, believe me.

Argento's visual style involves the use of lurid colours, flashy camera angles and other such flim-flam.  Coupled with the hysterical score (by the Goblins or Goblin or someone) this makes for strangely compelling viewing.  It would be a lot better without dialogue, or if it was in Italian and sub-titled.  That way the woefully inadequate script, acting and dubbing would not get in the way.

Argento seems to be throwing us into the deep end of the pool as a means of instructing us how to swim, and this scene - when seen in it's newly restored print with the full effect of the thundering surround sound - becomes one of the most shocking openings in horror movie history. from here on we're in Argento's clutches, and he proceeds to wring every drop of nervous paranoia out of us for 98 minutes until the film's intense and nearly unbearably upsetting conclusion.perhaps his consistency of vision is most impressive. the underlying theme of the movie - magic - seems translated onto every frame of film. the film flows with the free-association logic of a nightmare through sets and setpeices lit with eye-poppingly vibrant color and given a driving rhythm by it's mystical, mysterious soundtrack. we are given a minor shock and set up for another repeatedly, but the shock never seems to come from the place we expect it to. it is a fairy tale for adults, and by the time an hour has elapsed, we accept even the most outrageous of revealations. why? because, to put it simply, it's magic. near the end of the film, a character jumps from a ledge onto what we assume is solid floor. it is anything but, and it makes no sense from a realistic standpoint. how did this nasty suprise get there? simple. it wasn't there until she jumped.there are suprisingly few shocks in the film itself. yet, by the end of it, the audience is reduced to jelly. it's all in how deftly Argento manipulates our emotions. yes, it's dated in some respects. yes, it's pretty sadistic. yet you'll never see a film that's beautiful despite being absolutely horrible. deserves a place with Psycho, Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as one of the most unsettling films of all time.

However, considering the shockingly negative comments that have been dominating this discussion as of late, I felt it was my duty as a devoted Argentophile to defend and further acclaim this masterful film.Suspiria is the story of Suzy Banyon (cult superstar Jessica Harper, of Phantom of the Paradise and Stardust Memories fame), a young American woman who enrolls in the Tanzakedemie dance school in Germany...only to learn that this celebrated establishment is a beautiful front for a coven of evil witches.Yes, that's basically the plot...but Suspiria is not about plot...it's about experience. This is not an American horror film, and should not be judged by the same standards used to judge American horror films. As a matter of fact, Suspiria pretty much throws out the rules of cinema in favor of the logic of dreams...to put it bluntly, Suspiria is the definitive cinematic nightmare, a wildly colorful and dizzyingly stylish funhouse of blood and beauty. Take it seriously and you'll laugh. Take it too lightly and you'll be bored. It demands a degree of intelligence and sophistication from the viewer, but this does not mean that it necessarily follows any archetype, and it certainly should not be discredited for its lack of conventional movie wisdom.A lot of Argento's fans and critics alike attack his films for bad acting, but I would have to disagree, particularly in the case of Suspiria. All of the actors in this film are fine actors, and if their performances seem dull or weak its because Argento WANTED them to act that way, much the same way David Lynch put to great use intentional badness in such films as Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me, and the current smash Mullholland Drive.  The unusual performances in the film add to the surreal quality, benefitting both A.)the film's dreamy feel and B.)its root in gothic fairy tales.Suspiria is, in my opinion, one of the most truly terrifying films ever made. However, this is MY opinion. I find my nightmares to be far more frightening than any horror movie or ghost story or strange noises in the middle of the night. However, fear is a far more subjective emotion that people give it credit for-witness the unbelievably extreme responses to 1999's The Blair Witch Project-and thus it's not fair to blast Suspiria based on whether or not it frightened you. On a personal note, my all time favorite horror film is Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street...yet it has NEVER scared me. Contrary to what American filmmakers profess, horror films are about much more than simply scaring an audience. Essentially they are just conventional dramas, pushed to the extreme in terms of visceral emotional response and, often times, the explicitness of onscreen content. Such a definition could and should be applied to Suspiria.The most popular theory about Suspiria is one shared by many critics and many fans, and that is that the film is a technical masterpiece...period. This is something with which I partially agree, AND vehemently disagree. First off, Suspiria definitely has an emotional component to it. It's not as present as in other popular horror films of its time-Halloween, The Shining, A Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.-but its there. And while the plot gets criticized, its apparent weakness is crucial to the effectivness of the film; if the movie made sense, it wouldn't be scary at all! With all that having been said, I must admit that the strongest elements of Suspiria are its technical merits. In all honesty, this film is one of the best movies I have EVER seen in regards to 1.)cinematography, 2.)musical editing, 3.)camera movement, 4.)framing and composition, and 5.)original soundtrack. The film is literally a sensorial assault on the viewer, with bizarre color schemes and an even more bizarre soundtrack being thrust upon the audience throughout every frame. The most minute details are splashed across the screen in Argento's wonderfully fanciful style, and the result is....SUSPIRIA.I realize that I have done little more than defend Suspiria against some of its criticisms, but quite frankly I think the film speaks for itself as a true work of art. Suspiria is the most beautiful horror film ever made, and if you never thought that beautiful horror film could not be an oxymoron...watch this film immediately. This is truly required viewing for horror film fans, the perfect introduction for cinemaphiles everywhere into the fascinating realm of EuroHorror, and most of all the best possible starting point for anyone interested in the work of Dario Argento, who gets my vote as the finest director working today. The best thing about seeing Suspiria for the first time is that his other, less renowned films are even BETTER...which will be hard to believe by the time you are getting over the experience of this one!I highly recommend that you all purchase Anchor Bay's stunning DVD edition of the film, recently released in a standard edition as well as a three disc special edition. Unfortunately the three disc edition was limited to 100,000 copies, and after less than two months of release is all but impossible to find in stores. If you can get a copy, do so...it contains the excellent documentary Suspiria 25th Anniversary and overall gets my vote as the very BEST DVD on the market! However, the standard movie-only edition is extraordinary as well. It boasts a jaw-dropping transfer from the original negative of the uncut Italian version of the film, as well as a bevy of newly mixed DTS and Dolby Digital tracks and a batch of great supplements.Avoid the backlash, watch the film...and prepare to never again feel safe in the dark!My Grade A+ "},{"Title":"Rosemary's Baby goes to Satan's (dance) School for Girls ...","Date":"1 November 2001","Score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"  and FLUNKS!

They pay homage to The Cabinet of Caligari, The Cat People, The Mask of the Red Death and even Rosemary's Baby by duplicating sets from these movies, and borrowing plot elements from each. They also refer to heroic literary sources such as the Greek story of Theseus and the minotaur, and Dumas' Le Chevalier de Maison Rouge. The red mansion, which houses the Tanz Akademie (dance school) where most of the action takes place, is delightfully foreboding. But the great sets and scenes borrowed from various are not woven into whole cloth by means of an engaging, cohesive plot, or by strong dramatic performances. Even the lovely presence of Joan Bennett, whose performance in Woman in the Window (1944) once set the standard for film-noir femme fatales, is empty and robotic. Overall, Suspiria is derivative and mechanical. It reminds us that surrealism is a perceptive art, not a mathematical science.

As with most Argento films (at least in my opinion), plot is secondary to style, and this film has style to spare. All of the director's usual trademarks (colorful lighting, matter-of-fact visual statements, gory, elaborate death scenes, etc) are here in full-force as we also find Argento exploring a more supernatural avenue that he had not visited in his previous work at the time. Rather than using Hitchcockian murder mysteries, Suspiria tells it's story with nightmarish images and surreal setpieces. The set design and lighting make for some of the most visually stunning work I have seen in any film; oversaturated colors often give the viewer the impression the film is either bleeding like one of the story's victims or the screen itself is illuminated by some otherwordly supernatural glow. Sometimes we get both impressions at the same time and it always adds up to a stunning visual statement. Then there's the terrifying score by Goblin, a soundtrack that along with their score for Deep Red a friend of mine called the missing link between Tubular Bells and the score for Halloween. Appropiately garish, Goblin's score is as memorable as Bernard Herrman's Psycho and, quite frankly, the film probably wouldn't be as frightening without it. Memorable for it's scenes of terror and admirable for it's technical merits, any horror fan worth his or her salt needs to check out Suspiria.

This film is Dario Argento at his most creative, using more than just jump-scare tactics. The use of ambient lighting and shadows remind me of old German expressionist film techniques, which although limited to black and white, were still able to convey the full emotion of the scene. Here, visual effects are presented in blindingly bright colour and thick black shadow. In fact, the art direction is perhaps the most striking aspect of the film, making use of painfully imposing actual buildings in the German locale and gaudily decorated modern-70s-style sets. The use of extreme set-to-actor ratios, ranging from tiny, suffocating rooms to expansive indoor-and-outdoor locations, the viewer manages to feel a constant claustrophobia. The music and sound, quite piercing and discomforting, adds to the armrest-gripping mood of the film. There are a few problems, however, such as the fact that most of the actors do not speak English and are poorly dubbed. This sometimes slows down the progress of the film, as do the sometimes lengthy plot expositions provided at different points in the film. If you look at this film from a camp standpoint, some dialogue is downright hilarious, worthy of MST3K-style ripping. I do agree with lordrob in reference to the end, as the last act is almost a let down after such a strong buildup. I really have to say that Suspiria is one of my all-time favourite films. Having originally seen it on the small screen, I recently had the pleasure of seeing it again at the local English rep. cinema. Of course, the experience was quite different, and of course, this time, I was watching it in a packed theatre. (There were many more people laughing their heads off.) However, if you can, get a group of friends together and catch it if it comes to town. Or, if you can find it on video, turn off the lights and turn up the sound on the TV.

Going into a movie, especially a well-known, cult film, cold. (Well, that's not 100% true in this case &#x96; the score does mention the word witch, so beyond knowing it's famous and it's horror, I knew it had something to do with witches.)The result of me seeing this may not be the same as most people. I cannot comment on the DVD or BluRay version of this since I have not seen either. I wanted to see this one night for my October Horror Movie Marathon of movies I've never seen before and the best I could come up with was a YouTube version. So, maybe the incredibly BAD dubbed and TERRIBLE dialogue was part of that version. I dunno. What I do know is I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt (for the dialogue) since I watched this from YouTube.Beyond that and my free-pass, I observed the movie fully. It wasn't the most original movie, even for 1977 and the acting was subpar. But, I felt a lot of it was well shot and interesting despite the incredibly bad decisions our heroine makes throughout.Basically, the story goes a newcomer to the ballet world ventures to Europe and inadvertently gets involved in a cult academy. Weird scene after the next evolves until the final confrontation.Following this, and a day later, I would watch another one of Director Dario Argento's films to understand how weird this guy is. That movie, Phenomena (aka Creepers,) helped me see what his visions were and they don't mesh with my ideal horror film. So, there may be more out there that like his odd sense of filmmaking, but it's not my cup of European Tea.Unfocused and random this movie may be, it's ten times better than Phenomena (aka Creepers,) but it doesn't match the better horror movies locally made.

When you mix with formula with Dario Argento you get a strange blend of surrealist atmosphere, extreme violence and a chilling and memorable score. Suspiria lives outside of reality that is the best way to describe this, logic and physics are suspended here and if you are the type of person who can't end handle the surrealist nature of Alice in Wonderland you stand no chance here.The movie follows a newcomer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) to a higher class ballet academy and she discovers that the staff are a coven of witches that are hell-bent on chaos and destruction. The plot is silly at best but this is a film where the plot does not matter it there just to give the film so feel of structure.I don't where to begin with this movie, it is so insanely fantastically extraordinary that it deserves to be celebrated by all, horror fans and cinephiles alike.I shall start with the atmosphere because it is integral to the movie it is unrelentingly creepy and eerie, in my books it beats every single J- Horror hands down which is an honour because I have always said the atmosphere in a J-Horror could beat any movie from the USA and Europe, it looks like I am eating my words now because here we have terror in its purest form. The next integral part of this movie is the use of colour and not just any colour deep primary colours, to portray the tone. This is nothing short of amazing and I don't use that word lightly, on first viewing the colour just becomes a part of the movie but it works on an innate and subconscious level, our innate subconscious is readily aware that the colour red is danger, this is a device that I wish was used more in modern cinema and when I say used I mean used in the correct way to achieve what Argento has here and not only does the colour add to the atmosphere it adds to the bizarre and hallucinogenic feeling the movie seems to have. The cinematography works to the movie's advantage and makes a perfect partnership between the colour and it. Even the main theme is so incredibly beautiful on so many levels it manages to capture the mood of the movie and is so memorable and fantastic and it does far surpass any other horror film theme and that is probably due to it's avant garde nature the incomprehensible shouting and moaning just adds to Argento's irrational vision.Of course the film has a few winks and nudges to other classics but that is because unlike most others the film has succeeded in what it set out to do scare but not only scare it has become a work out art and therefore deserves to reference classics because it is in that league. It references Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead and The Exorcist and why shouldn't it have fun doing so but to be honest these might be best left until the second viewing because on the first viewing you will be so stunned with the set design and cinematography and colour you will not have enough time to spot them, your senses will be so stunned by the end of the film that you really won't know what hit you.Naturally there are two things that Argento will get stick for here one being graphic violence towards women. Argento has been accused many time for being sexist but he is adamant he is not A woman in peril is emotionally affecting. A man simply isn't. It's hard to disagree with his logic here and anywhere in horror cinema so here' s quick note for those who accuse him of such things, do your damn research before casting stones! The other thing people might have a hard time accepting is the use of extremely graphic violence itself but, it is not gratuitous it has a purpose it is to exploit the use of the colour. The colour of blood is another fundamental feature of this movie without it I am highly doubtful that it would have worked without it especially considering the most abundant colour in this film is a garish red. Surely this is a perfect movie because there is not one single feature you could tweak to make it better in any way and if you could do let me know I would be very intrigued.Skip to the End10/10The film is mesmerising, entrancing, terrifying and it has the most spectacular display of everything I have ever seen in a film.

Its proponents claim it's an absolute masterpiece and the greatest thing since canned beer, while its detractors say it's boring, pretentious, and not scary in the slightest. Where do I fall? Somewhere in the middle I'd say.First the good news from a technical standpoint, Suspiria is lovely to look at. The European locations are elaborate and interesting, the set pieces are creepy as hell, the film is beautifully photographed, and Argento's choice of color palette (lots of reds and blues) give it an otherworldly look all its own. I was less enthused by the constant pulsing, throbbing electronic music score by frequent Argento collaborators Goblin, which starts out suitably creepy but becomes more intrusive and eventually annoying as the film rolls on.The bad news story-wise Suspiria isn't very interesting and falls rather flat. An American girl (Jessica Harper) enrolls at an exclusive Ballet academy in Germany as a student. When she arrives at the school in a howling wind and rain storm, a girl rushes out of the building past her, and the camera follows this girl until she is eventually killed by an unseen murderer (in a fabulously brutal scene involving a knife, a rope and a stained glass skylight).As Harper settles into life at the Academy, strange things begin to happen, a few more bodies turn up, maggots fall from the ceiling, and eventually she figures out that All Is Not Right Here. When her closest friend at the school disappears (the viewer already knows that she fell into a room full of razor wire - OUCH!) she begins to investigate the odd goings-on, and eventually finds out that the Academy is actually a front for a hidden coven of witches, and that she's scheduled to be their next innocent victim. The last fifteen minutes or so are the best part of the movie, as she frantically tries to escape her fate.So is Suspiria worth a watch? I guess it depends on your tolerance for the artsy fartsy. Pacing is frustratingly mid-tempo; Suspiria is a fairly short film (just over 90 minutes) but I found myself wishing someone would just step on the gas pedal and speed things up more than once during its run time. The dialogue is mostly awkward and unrealistic, due to the fact that like most Italian horror films, it was recorded in a multitude of languages by the international cast and then dubbed into English (by people whose native language is not English) in post production. Gorehounds will, of course, enjoy the murder sequences (which are presented in lovingly gooey detail) but they are so few and far between that most of that crowd will be bored stiff while waiting for the next body to fall.In the end I'd say I enjoyed Suspiria to a certain extent but wasn't as impressed or blown away as I'd hoped I would be. I can definitely dig Argento's visual style but I can't say I'm as enamored with his storytelling ability.It was recently announced that an Americanized remake of Suspiria is in the works, and of course the horror community is tearing out its collective hair at the idea of remaking this classic. I'm probably one of the few who thinks that the Suspiria saga could benefit from a few modern tweaks and it could end up being a pretty damn good movie. I guess we'll see.

Two friends separately telling me this is a masterpiece? Wow it must be good! But oh my God was I unimpressed. I even found it difficult to sit through, having to watch it in two parts. Not because it was scary, but because it was so boring I couldn't stand it. I told one of my friends and he said 'stick with it, the ending is amazing'. The ending was not amazing, the ending was pathetic and even worse than the beginning. The last time this happened was with Rosemary's Baby, and what a piece of rubbish that was. This film in the same category.It has a bad script, is ill thought out, has boring subject matters (ballet and witchcraft, nice), then throws in some cod psychology and has some of the lamest scenes I've ever seen. Like when the girl is in the attic and the guy chasing her is taking forever to unhinge a simple latch. Then when she escapes thru a window she falls into a room full of barbed wire. Why on Earth is there a room full of barbed wire? (My friend tells me it's a trap, yeah OK...) And then instead of getting up she writhes around pathetically in it... And the ending, oh God, it was awful.But, I give this film a four because it has decent music (not amazing like I was told, but good original music by the Goblins) and some beautiful cinematography and excellent use of colours. It is worth watching for that alone, but, as another reviewer rightly said, in places some of that beauty is taken over by seediness and it has the feeling of a 70s porn film... but with no nudity. If you want to be scared or horrified don't watch this. This film is not scary, even for one second. This film is not the masterpiece I was told it was, how anyone could call it that is beyond me, and definitely falls short of being a work of art. I came away from this film feeling immediately disappointed and after a week of pondering it I now feel that it was pretentious art school rubbish. Thanks.

As a horror movie fan since I was a kid, and one who's seen plenty of horror films, this is probably my favorite. I remember going to the theater when this was first released and sitting there stunned and watching it twice in a row. I'd never seen anything like it. I was an Argento fan and expected this to be a giallo like BIRD and CAT, both of which I'd seen on TV and liked. I was unprepared for the fact that here the killer wasn't a suspect in the school but a witch, one of the three mothers, and that this wasn't a standard giallo, but a supernatural horror film made in a totally original style. Needless to say, it's become a classic since I first saw it, and I'm not surprised, because at the time I first saw it I recognized I was seeing something stupendous in the horror genre. The haunting tale seemed a contemporary update of Val Lewton's mysterious, ghostly films - an update with mind-bending color, operatic violence, incredible 'set pieces' and cinematic magic. Since then I've been quite an Argento fan and loved his supernatural follow-up INFERNO almost as much. The recent long anticipated end to the first two parts of his THREE MOTHERS trilogy was a terrible disappointment. If only he'd made it right after INFERNO when he was in the groove...but then we might never have had TENEBRAE, a superb giallo. Let's forget genre for a minute. This film is an intensely realized, dazzling piece of cinema that has lost none of its power over time.

Once there Susan sees another student named Pat Hingle (Eva Axén) running from the academy, some time later at her friends apartment Pat is viciously murdered. The next morning & the police question various students & teachers at the academy & Susan realise that she was the last person to see Pat alive the night before. Thinking about the chance meeting Susan remembers that Pat actually spoke to her when they passed each other but the loud thunder masked her words, deciding to investigate Pat's death & several other mysterious incidents at the academy Susan discovers that the academy was founded by an evil nineteenth century Witch named Elena Markos who may still be alive in the building doing evil Witch type things...This Italian produced fantasy horror film was co-written & directed by Dario Argento & stands out as one of his most visually impressive works, in fact Suspiria is one of the most sumptuous & best looking horror films out there in my humble opinion. Unfortunately while few could reasonably argue about Argento's style, imagination & competence as a filmmaker I personally think that few could argue successfully that Argento knows how to write films, construct plots that aren't ridiculous & flesh out character's beyond simplistic stereotypes. After an almost imperious start that oozes style, atmosphere, gore & an Argento trademark terrific set-piece murder it all goes downhill with a story & plot that really doesn't go anywhere or draw you in or engage in any satisfying way. In fact once the first impressive murder set-piece is out of the way little actually happens for what seems like an eternity, in fact it's around the hour mark before the next murder takes place & between the first & second murders not a lot happens. Then there's the Witchcraft exposition scene which has all the subtly of a sledgehammer, towards the end Susan visits some Witchcraft expert guy & in a scene which is there purely to get some exposition across & set up the instantly predictable twist ending this guy gives a long very forced sounding speech on Witchcraft & the academy in general. From that moment on you know, you just know how Suspiria is going to end. I appreciate that Aegento was trying to create some sort of abstract & weird environment & world in Suspiria but a lot of things from earlier in the film aren't addressed satisfactorily at the end, in particular the reason why so many character's act so oddly & weirdly is never really explained & the whole film ends up feeling silly & strange which is maybe what Argento wanted but I can't say I like it.The one area where Suspiria scores big points is in the style & cinematography departments. Suspiria quite simply looks fabulous from start to finish, the rich colour schemes, the precise framing of the shot & the silky camera movements all add up to make Suspiria a visual treat but whatever you do make sure you at least watch the full 2351 widescreen version & if you can manage it an anamorphic DVD on a good widescreen telly since it really does look stunning at times. Symetery seems to play a big part in Argento's shots here, lots of shots are every symmetrical with panelling & wooden beams being repeated on both sides of the frame, big arch ways with exactly the same pot plant decorations either side & even the swimming pool featured has a perfectly symmetrical tile pattern at it's bottom. The colours are extremely rich consisting of neon reds & blues, there were times when I thought the wallpaper in certain rooms were made of velvet they look so textured. There's not too much gore here & relatively few death's, there's a stabbing & a close-up of a beating heart in a cut open chest being stabbed, a hanging, there's a brief slit throat, a guide dog bites his masters throat out & a large pin is stuck in someones neck. Special effects are good but why do filmmakers insist on using rubber bats? They always look awful!Shot on location in Germany & in the studio in Italy the film has good production values & looks fabulous but the story & plot are far less satisfying which is a shame. The film was completely dubbed (according to an interview with star Jessica Harper the film was shot like a silent film & only a couple of scenes had live sound shot) so the original performances are hard to judge & I found it very odd listening to Udo Kier in this, I instantly recognised his face but his voice is dubbed by someone who doesn't sound a bit like him.Suspiria is one of those films where style wins out over substance, I think it's a great film to sit down & watch on a purely visual level but the story & plot are noticeably weak & surely if Suspiria didn't look as good as it does & it wasn't directed by Argento no-one would ever have heard of it today. The Hollywood remake Suspiria (2010) is currently in development.

This being said, there is not a moment in this well-wrought masterpiece that is not riveting. There is enough for the splatter-punk as well as for the viewer interested in a more traditional ghostly houses of the damned atmosphere.INFERNO, the second film in the Mater series, is highly recommended, however, for a clearer understanding of the Three Mothers concept.SUSPERIA is given a 10 for photography, an 8 for acting, a 10 for abject visceral horror, a 10 for atmosphere, a 10 for originality of storyline, and a 6 for executed plot... awarding a 9 for its entirety.As this reviewer will not be reviewing INFERNO, the viewer may want to note that the mysterious beauty in the musicology hall in Rome is the same girl who plays the ill-fated baby-sitter in Lucio Fulci's THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY. Fulci even uses the same seductive eye shot with this gorgeous actor, giving an obvious nod to our brilliant Poe-influenced director Dario Argento. Too, Fulci samples the bat in the hair scene from SUSPERIA, but makes it more gory in CEMETERY.Though SUSPERIA does not turn out to be the faerytale for adults that Argento had hoped for, it is certainly worth seeing more than once. Children and other impressionable persons should not, however, view this film. It should be added that Argento, as with many horror storytellers, banks upon the fear of death for impact. If, though, the receiver of the story has in some way conquered this fear, though the visuals still have powerful effect, the storyline itself loses much of its impact.

Upon the night she arrives, another student dies in a brutal stabbing (scenes of this are shocking). Afterward, other bizarre and deadly things begin to happen. The staff also seem controlling/manipulative over the entire school's attendants and goings on. Soon the occult and witchcraft become suspect.Mostly costume design is used given the film's date but there is one scene with a brief glimpse into some of the advanced sfx technology of the time. It's appears almost comical today as I'm sure our sfx will appear to others years down the road. The musical score (by The Goblins) reminds me of other old horror films that use music to scare or amp up the suspense. One scene in particular is shocking as it involves a student falling into a room filled with barb wire.

Suzy also suffers from health problems once the portly female cook(with Blanc's nephew by her side)blinds her with the reflection of sunlight bouncing off a butcher knife.Argento, thanks to the supernatural aspects of the story, is set free of the limitations a giallo holds him to.

Many of the best horror films ever made are horrifying because we become so involved with the protagonists that we alternate between shock and sadness when bad things happen to them. In its present form, Suspira won't resonate after viewing and is a bit of a one-trick pony.But, for all its lack of substance, it is a well-made film. Argento is creative when staging the gruesome murder scenes. They're somewhere between the ridiculous and surreal, but are always scary. Hes a very talented director at least visually, as all of his films look beautiful. The use of colors for a horror film hasn't been this fine since the mid-60s output of Mario Bava. Still, the lack of a story is a major drawback. I'm one of the few that'd rather watch a film by an American horror filmmaker from the period than the European ones (Argento, Bava, Jess Franco) who're mainly interested in creating an atmosphere.

I had heard that this was one of the goriest films in cinema history but 'Suspiria' barely had any gore. As a movie itself, there was little that appealed to me. The thing that stood out is the use of colour as that was handled quite well because it contributes to the creepy tense atmosphere. Also, the soundtrack is quite suitably unsettling. Argento was under the impression that he was making something great. However, storywise, it has nothing new to offer. The film feels dated. It follows the usual routine of newcomer girl goes to ballet school and things start happening (yeah her friend gets murdered too) and so on. Many times I found myself yawning. The dialogues are plain ordinary but the cinematography is good in places. The acting is campy even though Jessica Harper is passable. There are three murder scenes which are amateurishly shot and unintentionally funny. Actually, I found much of 'Suspiria' to be funny without meaning to be. Overall, it's a huge disappointment.

Having now viewed several in the interest of completeness, I must conclude that horror fans will praise anything if it happens to be foreign.Thus far, these viewing experiments have yielded extreme silliness; only Dellamorte Dellamore and Phenomena have even begun to live up to their reputations, in my opinion.  Suspiria is one of the worst of the bunch, as it appears that such concepts as story construction, plot logic, and character motivation are as much a mystery to the writer as the plot is to the heroine.While there are many atmospheric moments here, they are essentially built around nothing.  Such terrifying moments of realization such as the directress isn't really out of town and the teachers all leave at night fail to drum up much tension, despite the desperate whisperings of characters who come off as paranoid schizophrenics in their histrionics over next to nothing.Not to give anything away (spoiler alert), but how is it that a coven which has existed for over a hundred years is so easily felled by a single ditzy dance student?  Was no one else in history Einstein enough to put it all together before now?  Why is the directress, who has her own hidden chamber, sleeping in a temporary dorm room on the other side of a sheet from the students?  Why is a coven of witches running what appears to be a legitimate dance academy, even going so far as to recruit students from overseas?The film seems sadly uninterested in answering any of these questions, thus winding up as a singularly unsatisfying experience.  If this is what true horror fans consider the holy grail of horror cinema, then I am happy not to be counted among their number.

As soon as the main b*tch was walking through the airport I knew I was again in for the stupid light bulb bullsh*t. He can take his red, green, blue, purple etc. bulbs and shove them up his *ss. I think there's a torture porn video of a guy breaking glass in his rectum and there's no doubt in my mind that it was somehow influenced by his hate for the visionary lighting skills of Dario Argento. Except for that, the opening scene made it seem like this might actually be a good film. Good use of the camera, editing and location....same for Inferno with the underwater scene. The filming from the trees was pretty good too (besides the shitty flood light) but it all turned to C grade horror during the 1st murder. The b*tch is screaming about a murderer even though she can't get in the room to see what's happening. There's a hairy arm smushing the other c*nt's face on the window? Maybe the arm belonged to the hairy monster in The Lords of Salem.In grade school I used to build gory sets in the entrance of our house every Halloween and the paint blood I used looked pretty similar to Argento's paint blood... I'd like to think my sets were scarier than Argento's because they probably were. Speaking of sets, they were suppose to be the best thing about this film and I've seen numerous people say how psychedelic they were. N*gger please. You can actually see places on the walls where they didn't put even layers of paint. They were also using acrylic (doesn't reflect light) and enamel (reflects light) black paint on some of the walls. Light reflecting paint actually looks natural and I think that's what he wanted but I guess they must've f*cked that up somehow or ran out and had to use the cheap stuff. The railing looked like Styrofoam spray painted with gold...terrible. Lesson gold spray paint does not make an object look like polished brass. Speaking of the railing...why were there windows around it? That wall was just 'there' even though it had nothing to do with the foundation of the building if you looked at it from the outside. Anyway, the rest of the set had a high school play quality to it and many of the hand painted designs were probably painted by high school kids. However, that doesn't mean this movie was better than a high school play...One of the funniest parts was the pointless and non-nonsensical killing of blind Adam Sandler by his own German Shepherd. Or did it kill him because he had some raw meat on his neck...? Hopefully one day they'll address this point in an ultra deluxe Criterion blu-ray release. What else? The maggots... totally visionary. People think maggots are creepy...lets get some maggots. Same with the bat. Bats...hmmm. The room with the giant slinky was brilliant. When I was a little kid I decided to get myself stuck in a slinky during nap time at a babysitter's house but she walked in before I got out. I had my *ss whooped so it brings back the fear.Why is that Austrian woman smiling all the time? Are her teeth bleached? How can she teach ballet when she uses a cane? Mysteries, mysteries.Then there's the whole dubbing English over Italians mouthing English words thing... Bat sh*t insane. Just speak Italian and subtitle it. There would've been much more time left over to fix the many other problems in the film. But oh well, what can you do? All in all I cannot see Dario as a visionary even in the slightest sense. The man does not possess the skill set for film making. At best, he's just some guy who has never been good at anything in his life but somehow managed to acquire enough money to make movies. He masquerades his accidents as intentional and his short-sightedness as artwork. I can see how maybe some grade school kids eating freeze pops or a group of stoners looking for some laughs might be entertained by this but beyond that I think there's little of value here. The best thing about the film is the soundtrack and the f*cking wallpaper.

The reason it fails may be due to its age, but I doubt it. In 1970 films like Alien created doom atmosphere in the most believable way with no cheese, and simply make this movie look like a student film by comparison. No, the reason it fails at being a children's fairytale done wrong is because it tries so hard to be mature by creating suspense that it just creates boring, predictable, and sloppily executed.The movie opens with the first murder, and I simply cannot think of a more amateur, sloppy way for it to have taken place. It's more reminiscent of a cheese parody than a horror movie. It actually had me chuckling. Once again, I can't blame this on the era it was made because other movies in that same era nailed death scenes better than any modern movie could hope to do the cheese is from poor ideas and poor film making. If this is Dario Argento at his best, what is his worst? An episode of Sesame Street? I'm worry, I can sometimes excuse an old movie of cheese, but I can't get over the fact this was made after Alien. Dario Argento should have known better, and he could have done better, but he didn't, thus I'm not going to look past the fact the murder scenes were so poorly done I couldn't hold back laughing.As far as gore goes, there is so little I don't even find it worth mentioning. So I won't. Just know that most of the stab wounds don't even show blood, and the blood that is in this film looks more like clown paint than plasma.But by far the biggest flaw of the film is the lack of any cohesive storytelling whatsoever. One scene will be an over-the-top (but not graphic or violent) murder scene, the next will be a ballerina scene that adds nothing to the movie, and the next will be some teachers talking about nothing that has anything to do with the movie. There is no order. At least 50 minutes of the runtime are completely pointless to the rest of the movie&#151;and this is supposed to be scary? These scenes don't build suspense or character, they just build boredom.In the end when all the mysteries are explained it was almost like a cute, trite, cliché slap in the face. The explanation for everything going on has been done so many times in horror movies I honestly would have liked the movie better if it cut off and ended right before explaining it all. I don't understand how something that is supposed to be a work of art is as unoriginal or sloppily done as this. If this is a work of art, the entire film is nothing but a poorly drawn stick person drawn with bright colored Crayons.The only sole good thing I can say about this movie is that the soundtrack is great. That is all.I'll never understand why so many people seem to think that if something is old, it has to be good, and if something is new it has to be bad. Also, especially with the horror crowd if something is indie or foreign it is good, if it's American it's bad. This film the perfect example of why that thinking is wrong. Especially when the American, 1970's Alien came out in the same era. There is no reason for Suspiria to be as bad as it is, and I cannot excuse its faults because it's old.All I can say is what I said in the beginning Dario Argento should have, could have, and probably does know better than he put into this movie.2/10.

Often cited by fans as one of his greatest films, I fail to understand why so many horror buffs get so worked up about this rather uninteresting and muddled effort.Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American dancer who joins a strange dance academy where some gruesome murders have just taken place. Gradually, Suzy unravels the mystery surrounding the bizarre school and eventually comes face to face with the ancient evil that is hiding within.Opening with a wonderful scene in which Suzy emerges from an airport and is met by a torrential downpour, and followed soon after by two grisly and inventive deaths, Argento delivers a truly promising start to the film. Unfortunately, between this great beginning, and the fairly creepy finalé, the film consists of over an hour of ridiculous and very tedious drivel.I realise that much of the appeal of an Argento film lies in the stylish direction, and narrative usually takes a back seat to the visuals, but I found Suspiria to be equally lacking in both departments. The story leaves many unanswered questions (the main one for me being 'why would a coven of witches run a dance school?') and Argento's usual inventive camera-work is replaced by an excess of garish lighting (maybe he got a job lot of coloured bulbs cheap from somewhere). Furthermore, the soundtrack (by the usually reliable Italian rock band, Goblin), begins melodiously but soon descends into a migraine-inducing cacophony.Throw in a couple of truly laughable scenes&#151;one involving a clockwork bat attack and another with a victim inexplicably escaping into a room full of unwound spools of wire(!)&#151;and the result is a below-par effort from the usually impressive Argento.

That's a signal that more bloodletting is about to take place. So much for subtlety.Dario Argento has filmed the whole thing on bold, fake looking sets with crooked camera angles, using color to create a campy, surreal looking atmosphere, and lots of carnage.

And that due two reasons, the way it was shot and edited made it worth seeing and became a standard for Argento flicks, well back then, nowadays his flicks aren't worth picking up. The other reason is that by coincidence, the development of the film was done in a wrong way which turned out in saturated colours. And the mistake became the reason why so many people are seeing this as a standard. The use of red and green lighting saturated is still done nowadays. Naturally the blood looks extreme due the saturation which adds another positive note to Suspiria.But it isn't of course all hail to Suspiria. It is in fact low on gore and even when the murders are happening be sure that you watch the full uncut version as I did. It's only in that version that you see it in full glory. I also know that people seeing it for the first time didn't understand Suspiria.

This movie is too flawed.This film relies too heavily on visual and musical effect. The plot is very thin and it's hard to hold on throughout the film, particularly because you don't know what you're holding on to. There is nothing ordinary or realistic about the setting, the characters, or the film itself. Dario Argento uses odd camera angles and the film is heavily saturated with lurid, florescent colors. There is lots of optical imagery and symmetrical, geometric patterns. If only I could appreciate the craft... it seems to be done for effect rather than enhance the story so I cannot commend it fully. It fails more often than not. The murder scenes are definitely the most interesting parts of this movie. If I remember correctly I think there are three - three girls and a blind man. One girl is murdered in the earlier portion of the film, stabbed repeatedly and thrown through a stain-glassed roof and hanged. It serves as one of my favorite scenes because it's creative in many regards. Another memorable scene that sticks out is the one where we see a girl fall into a bed of barbwire. It felt fresh in a movie rotten with inadequacies. The blind man's death is irrelevant. There are too many plot holes to fully enjoy this film. There are many unexplained nuances - characters that are irrelevant and certain sub-plots that aren't explained in the slightest regard. Many scenes drag along sluggishly without direct intent, as if there is some pervasively intriguing mystery afoot. Especially annoying is the music score. It pervades the film like a stink bomb. There are times when I put my hand to my face and shook my head. The bright and colorful setting, the annoying soundtrack, mediocre acting, and very shaky plot makes for a film that plays to the senses and avoids the intellect. Would I recommend this movie? Sure, it's okay. Reading the reviews and looking at the rating, it's obvious many people enjoy the sensual stimulation, but that's as far as it gets. That's only one portion of a movie. All other categories are severely lacking. It does deserve some credit, however. I did in fact rate this film a 5-out-of-10, so there must have been something I enjoyed about it.

It was followed up by the uneven but excellent Inferno and completed with the pretty bad Mother of Tears. Suspiria, however, is the classic. With this movie Argento moved away from his giallo roots into pure horror. Having said that this is a supernatural horror film with gialloesque elements. For one thing, the murders are committed with the assailants off-screen keeping their identity a secret in the manner of the giallo. Secondly, the protagonist recalls a half-remembered, vital clue at the climax of the movie that proves crucial in uncovering the mystery. This was a device that Argento used in several of his other gialli before and after Suspiria. But in stylistic terms, this film was a considerable leap forward. The look is resolutely unrealistic. Argento's use of coloured lighting is the most obvious factor that makes the world of Suspiria so strange and artificial. He clearly took his cue from the 60's movies of Mario Bava which were also colourful in a similarly impressive way. The intense colours contribute to the idea of Suspiria resembling some kind of a nightmare. It all looks extremely impressive throughout thanks in large part to the beautiful cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.Suspiria is a fairy-tale for adults. When originally conceived the schoolgirls were much younger teens. Unsurprisingly given the violent content it was decided that this would just be too problematic and the age of the girls was increased. However, you will notice that they often act in child-like ways as if they are still playing the parts of younger girls. Not only this but Argento added details like handles on doors positioned higher than normal meaning the girls seem smaller when reaching up to use them. In general, the gaudy décor and the Tans Academy building itself are menacing. The building and décor create an uneasy feeling all by themselves. The atmosphere throughout the movie is perhaps the greatest thing about it. Right from the wondrous opening this is a film full of menace and a feeling of that something just isn't right. We follow the lead character Suzy Banyon from arrival in Freiberg airport via a taxi journey to the Tans Academy dance school in the middle of a rain storm. In this brilliant opening it becomes clear that one of the things that marks out the genius of Argento is in the way he can make the most ordinary everyday objects seem completely threatening. Automatic doors and night fountains suddenly become strangely sinister in the world he creates.It would be impossible, however, to discuss the merits of Suspiria without making reference to its soundtrack. Italian prog-rock group Goblin had already worked with Argento before, providing an excellent score to Deep Red. But here with Suspiria they really do excel themselves. It's like no other soundtrack recorded before or since. It's made up of a cacophony of disparate ideas - sighs, a sickly lullaby, hard rock, avant-garde experimentalism and thundering drums. Altogether, it's multi-layered and completely original. It works too. The music is genuinely unsettling and creepy and aligned with Argento's incredible visuals it packs a considerable punch. Suspiria is an assault to the senses aurally as well as visually.In addition, Suspiria benefits from a great cast. Jessica Harper is excellent in the lead role. She is a very compelling presence and her subdued performance is a perfect counterpoint to the extreme events that she encounters. There are two very impressive performers in Alida Valli and Joan Bennett who both add considerable gravitas to the cast. Stefania Cassini and Udo Kier are both performers I like but unfortunately here they both are dubbed by lacking voice artists. A shame considering both actors have great, expressive voices themselves.This is a horror movie with considerable cinematic artistic merit. As a visual and aural feast for the senses the genre has rarely came up with anything quite like this before or since.

Actually it isn't an interesting story and it's quite short also but that doesn't matter much. Jessica Harper is really good in this movie, but there are some actors that I don't think are so good in it.I like how it starts at the airport with the music and the storm. Something happens already in the beginning and it's never boring because you know that something can happen anytime, like a dog suddenly bite his owner by no reason.I give this movie 10/10 because I really think this is a beautiful movie, it is definitely worth watching.

If anything, Dario Argento art directs this movie within an inch of its life, to a point where it actually succeeds to separate itself from its horror roots and begins to open itself to a perverse fairy tale. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are one of the most tense moments of mounting horror I have seen in a while (despite the horrible dialogue and the bad dubbing, courtesy of what seems to be the norm of Italian movies of the period). Its setup, consisting of Jessica Harper's character, Susie Bannion, arriving at the school of dance that she is to attend in the middle of a storm. (Why she doesn't take the storm as a signal that maybe this might not be the ideal place for her is anyone's guess.) A girl, Pat Hingle, runs out screaming into the night and winds up at the neighboring dorm where a friend takes her in, but soon later she meets a grisly fate in a fantastic sequence that has become a classic all its own.

The film takes clear glee in tossing a young American girl head first into a fierce cauldron within a foreign place further still within a foreign nation, plunging her into the pouring rain that greets her as she makes her way beyond the international boundaries marked by way of an airport's exit and then into what will come to form a bleak proverbial mire. The howling wind and driving rain makes it tough to keep dry and retain a normalised, balanced look; she drags her luggage through the conditions made tougher with little in the way of other people around to help; then, upon tyring to obtain access to a taxi, she is shunned by the mechanical-like driving past of various cabs until, finally, one stops to pick her up. Salvation? Not really - even communication with the driver is difficult through the language barrier.Once at her destination, you'd think the worst of it was over; the trekking out from where she's from and limping through the initially difficult stages of getting there only to, at last, get to where it is she's going. Not so, as further confusion over the intercom at the entrance to the locale follows, before a girl not that much older flees from the door in an hysterical and garbled mess. Away from what the lead female is able to witness, but perversely informing a continuously watching audience thus informing us and not her that something is definitely wrong with this place, someone or something catches up with the escapee, and she is dispatched in a less than pretty display. There begins 1977 film Suspiria, and the two key items that will come to act as foundations for the film; namely, that notion of a young woman being in a foreign locale in which she will struggle or suffer hardships, along with the catalyst in the form of overlying terror and unnerving ambiguity, particularly in regards to the mystery as to what's actually unravelling behind the scenes in this place.The film is one of such which revolves around a girl in a location she has every right to be wary of and initially struggle through before getting a grip on the situation and rising to what it offers. Jessica Harper plays the lead, a young and fragile looking American named Suzy Bannion. She's a dancer, one of whom has showed such promise in recent times back home that enrolling at a prestigious school in West Germany beckons; that notion of, not West Germany, but Europe in general being a locale of both culture and academia rearing its head once again &#x96; when intelligent American characters need to journey somewhere so as to study something at a higher level, Europe always seems to be the place they either travel to or strive to travel to.After night-set shooting and blood red hues dominating the frame during Suzy's arrival and the young girl's death, we are greeted by fresher, bluer and more welcoming tones the following morning. All appears well at the dance school, the employees are welcoming and quick to dismiss any of the foulness raised from the previous night. The other girls appear in relatively stark contrast to Suzy, her one confidant in Sara (Casini) already at a stage in her own paranoia which will see things on that particular strand effectively unravel later on. The school comes across as somewhat of a female dominated zone, one female student encapsulating the feminine empowerment at the place in her strutting around a dormitory room whilst bare legged and whilst in a loose white gown of some description, wielding cigarette holders in a sultry and fetishistic manner. The male students few-and-far between amidst all the female ones, and the school is a place in which most of the men appear to do either the menial work or exist to purely serve the woman in some form. One of these men arrives in the form of an apparently mute Romanian butler, a male charged with moving items to and from locations therein in an unfussy and subdued manner, while a blind pianist must play what he is told to until he himself can take it no longer and is then punished for his disobedient transgressions.Suzy's eventual clashing with the school in this and mostly every regard is seemingly obligatory, Argento's film a very gradual; bleak, brooding and ruthlessly effective little number covering substantial ground in both the thriller, horror and mystery genres. The entire film arrives with a pumping and pulsating musical score upon which first heard appears to be a chorus of Islamic prayers acting as a coating to some high pitched breathing and gasping, all the while accompanied by blaring bursts of throbbing acoustic guitar combining wonderfully and acting as a fantastic over-tune to proceedings. The film builds to a quite chilling culmination, the notion of building and brooding your way to something and providing us with an attentive enough attitude towards character evident and working with the film as it concludes with a large payoff; there is nary a sign of dunderheaded schlock frills for eighty minutes before the cheap wrapping of everything off. Suspiria is good fun, a playful and well made little film delivering on a number of levels as it covers its lead's descent into the uncanny unknown.

From what I could glean, the term refers to a pulpy style of Gothic thriller, most prominent in the cinema in the 1960s and 1970s. 'Suspiria (1977)' &#x96; stylistically, half Roger Corman and half Brian De Palma &#x96; boasts a strong emphasis on dreams and paranoia, and a perverse fascination with the act of murder. One early death, a real show-stopper, is depicted in glorious operatic slow- motion, and sees a young student (Eva Axen) hanging from a glass ceiling. If I wasn't giving this film my full attention, I was now! Needless to say, the original US theatrical cut was bowdlerised quite liberally. The film's soundtrack, by a band called Goblin, is supremely unsettling, though it rises so loudly above the dialogue volume that I had to watch the film with remote control at the ready.An American girl (Jessica Harper) arrives in Germany to attend a prestigious dance academy, only to discover that the school is governed by a coven of witches. The plot may be wafer-thin, but the visuals are utterly amazing. The school hallways blaze with orange at night-time, casting ominous, exaggerated shadows across the walls. The building itself seems to pulsate with sinister intent; in fact, I was reminded of 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920),' in which otherwise solid walls distort violently to match the twisted mind of its narrator. Blood is coloured such a fierce red that it appears unreal, lending the violence a sense of theatricality, an operatic intensity that elevates it above most contemporary American horror films. It's well known that Brian De Palma was a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock, but his style appears to borrow just as freely from films like this.

It's one of the most beautifully realized horror films I've ever seen, so gorgeous in it's sound and visual compositions, that it easily overcomes any flaws in the narrative or, especially, the acting. Now, I should note that I am nowhere CLOSE to being an expert on Dario Argento or his filmography. In fact, this is the only film of his that I have seen, which, to me at least, is somewhat puzzling, because I've always known about his work, and he is a huge influence on both Quentin Tarantino AND John Carpenter, and those are two of my all time favorite directors. But for whatever reason, I just never got around to seeing any of Argento's films. Fortunately, I have a good friend of mine who has very good taste in film, and he's helping me fill in some of the gaps in my cinematic knowledge. And in return, I'm introducing him to some of Brian DePalma's work that he hasn't seen yet, so it all works out. But anyway, back to Suspiria. Just from what I've read, Argento is primarily known for his Giallo films, or Italian horror- slash-thriller films, if you will. Again, these are films that I look forward to becoming more familiar with, and although I've seen nearly all of Lucio Fulci's films, I think I owe it to myself to check out some of Mario Bava's films, as well as Argento's early efforts in the genre. Suspiria, however, was a bit of departure for Argento, who was looking to break away from the conventions of giallo in favor of something more supernatural. And though this film has elements of giallo, such as the extended murder sequences, the overall mise-en-scene creates a dream-like atmosphere of unreality.FOR MORE, CLICK ON THE LINKhttp//www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY2Jkmxplgk "},{"Title":"Worth watching for horror completists, but not as classic as it's made out to be.","Date":"19 May 2010","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Being a huge fan of Deep Red, Tenebre and Phenomena, and having seen several other Argento films, I tracked Suspiria down too. At the time I bought it, it was fairly hard to get, and the only copy I could find was an R1 special edition. I figured quids in.With this being an exhaustive special edition package, and listed on IMDb as the 'fullest' cut of the movie available, I assume outside of watching it on my telly, I watched the best version I could get my mitts on.Suspiria is an extremely stylish film with a sustained atmosphere and artistic direction that's very powerful. Artistically, outside of some very creaky special make-up effects that look like an art student's attempt at a horror movie, not a real horror movie, the film is hard to fault.Its soundtrack is a masterpiece. An absolute masterpiece.Unfortunately as entertainment instead of art, Suspiria is rubbish. The movie runs only 92 minutes, a good 20 minutes shorter than most of Argento's giallos, but feels like an eternity compared to the fleet-footed Phenomena or the well paced epic that is Deep Red. It's dull, uninteresting, and even the much vaunted set-pieces irritate more than impress and are fury-inducingly few and far between.Horror/stalk and slash set-pieces are gratingly slow, going through tension and into 'god just kill them off already', and go out of imaginative into just plain ludicrous. One girl is murdered after nearly ten minutes of preamble by a disembodied werewolf arm with a knife while inexplicably being seemingly astrally projected between 4 different locations as she absorbs way more stab wounds than any human body could possibly sustain, only to finally die when thrown through a window she wasn't anywhere near attached to a cord that seemed to be wrapped round half her house. An hour later, another girl comes a cropper after nearly 15 minutes by climbing through a window and into a room that has for no obvious reason been used to stock several cubic foot of barbwire, then murdered by another disembodied arm. They are intentionally long, drawn out, and, oddly for Argento, limply shot from unimaginative angles, relying on bizarre colour combinations and 'nails on chalkboard' music to try and make them frightening. Tenebrae this is not. Do not expect any crazed hand-held shots, any 'Axe POV' shots, or even that many close ups. Do expect a chronically bad cardboard heart at one point though.On top of this, relatable characters do not exist in Suspiria. Jessica Harper is eminently watchable but epically useless, leaving her entire friendship group to die while she languishes in bed with a headache most of the film. Everyone else aside from the head of the school is window-dressing, either props to the dancing school atmosphere or cannon-fodder for the long-winded murder sequences.The storyline is limp-wristed and unimpressive. Here it is Oops. I joined a school run by a murderous coven of witches. Better do something about that...once I've taken some paracetamol and someone stops flashing that red light in my eyes. That's about it.The biggest problem by far though is that the environment Suspiria happens in is so poorly defined. There are no rules or reality at all in this movie. Initially this is terrifying and confusing. By minute 25 you'd kind of expected a storyline to kick in and it hasn't, and you're checking your email at the same time as watching the film.Point is, most Argento fans are divided by 'is Suspiria best or Deep Red'. I come down on the Deep Red side. Deep Red is a movie. Designed for entertainment purposes by a highly creative and artistically left-of-field director. Suspiria is an indulgent vanity project created with an 'art first, narrative and coherency later' approach. I felt like it was intentionally designed to alienate and confuse instead of entertain and engross, and it was an extremely frustrating and boring, if beautiful 92 minutes.

He makes wonderful horror and mystery movies. Such movies as The Bird with Crystal Plumage, Four Flies on Grey Velvet, and Deep Red are simply art on film. This film is certainly no exception, this time it strays from a giallo and steps towards a more surreal, supernatural feel.The movie is about a pretty young woman named Suzy Banion (played wonderfully by Jessica Harper) who is going from New York to a luxury dance academy in Germany. Upon arriving at the academy, she sees a woman named Pat Hingle (Eva Axén) escaping from the academy in a panic. That night, Pat is brutally dispatched upon arriving at her apartment building. The next day, Suzy meets the directors of the academy, Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) along with a beautiful yet jumpy young lady named Sara (Stefania Casini). Sara warns Suzy that Pat was one of her friends in the academy and that Pat ran away because she believed the academy was being run by witches, ultimately leading to her death. Sara begins to become more aware of the strange things happening at the school, such as footsteps outside of her room and a strange hoarse yawning that echoes throughout the academy. Sara continues to tell Suzy about the mysteries going on around the academy until she to is murdered. It is then up to Suzy to conquer the evil force that's running the academy before she is the next victim.The surreal and sometimes day-dreamy quality of the film seems like you are watching someone's nightmare on your television. Scenes like a conversation between Sara and Suzy in a mosaic pool and Pat's twisted death scene gives the feeling of something that an artist would paint while hallucinating from a drug. The red and blue colored filters that show up during shadowy and dark scenes make the film feel like it's being watched through the eyes of the monster tormenting our heroine. Some standout scenes would be not only Pat's scene, but also a scene in which Sara is chased into a room full of razor wire and then killed with a gleaming straight razor, along with the twisted climax in which Suzy comes face-to-face with a clear view of the terror that haunts the academy. Once the movie is at it's end you feel like you have witnessed the same terror that Suzy has seen, along with the feeling of relief that comes from Suzy escaping the academy during a rain storm. This movie is one of the only movies that I will ever truly need to see on Blu-Ray or HD because the surreal and colorful movie must be seen in all possible beauty and crisp view possible. It deserves to have a place on the Top 250 (Not unlike Halloween, Silent Night Bloody Night or Black Christmas) and it deserves to be recognized as a classic.

I haven't seen all of his films, but this one certainly has a lot going for it. Few films can match it, in any genre, for cinematography. The lighting is superb and surreal, the use of geometric patterns amazing. There aren't that many death sequences, but the ones present are dynamic and disturbing. The initial murder has a dance student being stabbed multiple times before being pushed through in immense skylight to fall and be strangled by a cord. Unfortunately, the effects man has scant knowledge of the inner workings of the human being, otherwise he wouldn't have created an exposed heart for the killer to stab. However, that aside, the shots here are incredibly effective, and watch for the great shot of the second corpse on the floor among the tiles and broken glass. Argento cast Jessica Harper in the lead role. It's an excellent choice in terms of her physical beauty and childlike innocent staring, but once she starts talking, the character is marred. Harper sounds like a 38 year old woman in an 18 year old's body. View this for the colors, lighting, and repeated patterns, the long shots of empty corridors, and the building sense of dread. You will have to overlook the slipshod dubbing and the lackluster ending comes across like a wet fart. There is a cool nod to one of Argento's previous films, The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, in the final sequence. However, when we at last see the showdown between Jessica and The Directress, you can't help but feel let down. The scene is all too short and rather silly. Compared to the rest of the film, this seems very rushed. Don't let that dissuade you from a few viewings. Argento fully realizes how to utilize color to manipulate your mind. There are suspenseful moments(including one sequence that seems straight out of Saw), but no scares.

I've often been rather hard on this film as I've always looked at it as a flawed masterpiece but I must admit that this was probably my fourth viewing and the film struck me a lot better this time. I still think there's a very big flaw in the story that could have been worked on better but there's no doubt in my mind that this is one of the most technically flawless films ever made. Not just in the horror genre but any genre. Even though I have issues with the story I wouldn't argue too much with anyone who would call this Argento's masterpiece because everything he's known for hits all the right notes here. Everything from the visual style to the rather terrifying music score are perfectly captured and really makes for an intense movie. There are only three deaths in the film but all three are downright unsettling and nail biting. The movie is somewhat like a roller coaster ride as Argento builds up great tension only to come down several notches as to let the viewer catch their breathe. The opening fifteen-minutes of this film are among some of the greatest ever in a horror movie. The brilliant use of lighting, the wonderful score and the use of the thunderstorm make for some great atmosphere, which then boils over with a terrific and quite memorable death scene. Harper is good in her role even though I think a stronger actress could have been found. The supporting players are all nice as well but again they aren't anything too special but I'm sure this didn't matter too much to Argento who clearly meant for this to be a visual film.American versionOne might ask why anyone would bother watching an edited version of a film that has countless uncut versions on DVD from various countries in the world. Well, the recently aired American version has shown up on Fox Movie Chanell as well as on Netflix and it's worth watching for a few reasons. First is that we can see how audiences originally got to see the movie when it was released here. This American version is around six-minutes shorter than the uncut one and it goes without saying that a lot of the death scenes were trimmed. The masterfully done opening murder misses quite a few shots of violence as does every murder that follows. The dog attack suffered the most amount of cuts but it doesn't stop there. Everything that happens before the attack is pretty much missing and this really takes away from the murder as it doesn't help explain anything. The knife cutting the throat is also edited to the point where you can't tell anything. There's no question seeing the movie with the edits certainly hurts things and that's why this will remain a curio at best. However, there are a few great things here. The biggest being that the print is actually better than any version I've seen and that includes the Anchor Bay one. We also get a marvelous Stereo track that has you hearing this masterful film like the very first time. The sound is so crystal clear that I was hearing things that I hadn't ever really noticed before. This American version also has the complete end credits and not the freeze-frame that hampers many of the current DVD releases. Another alteration is the opening titles, which are completely different here. When the title appears it looks like pinkish lungs breathing and giving the title more movement. This is certainly something minor but as a fan of the film it was nice seeing this alternate opening. Again, if you want to fully experience SUSPIRIA then you must see it uncut. Once you've seen it uncut I can't help but recommend this American version just as a bit of nostalgia and getting to see it like people originally did. The print and audio here will hopefully find it's way to DVD (uncut of course) at some point. "},{"Title":"Brilliant. A nightmarish fever dream on film","Date":"3 October 2008","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Prior to seeing Suspiria tonight I had never seen a Dario Argento film. The procrastination was partly due to the mixed response to Argento and this film from people I trust on film- half of them said this was brilliant and unforgettable, the other half said it was comically dated and completely ludicrous.To be completely honest... Both sides are 100% right. Suspiria features some brilliantly stylized horror set-pieces, but the special effects are never convincing. One could argue that making the 'blood' such a bright shade of red was a legitimate aesthetic choice which contributed to the color scheme of the film itself, which is dominated by bright red, but the rest of the effects just aren't all that great. As far as I'm concerned though, as a lifelong Doctor Who fan... Suspiria looks like it was made yesterday to me. I can completely understand how so many people think this is dated, and even a quick glance at the preposterous excuse for a plot here- girl goes to dance school which turns out to be populated by witches and lots of very, very bad things happen, supports the claims of ridiculousness aimed at the film. In addition, Suspiria features bad voice acting from certain characters (none of the physical performances are really bad, but the dubbing definitely is in some cases), some absolutely ludicrous dialogue, and probably a good number of plot holes I couldn't bother with spotting.This brings us to the question of what defines a 'flaw'? Is Suspiria significantly flawed because it features a preposterous plot and dated special effects which don't really match many films of its time? Is it inherently flawed because some of the dialogue is absolute cack? Or is a film only significantly flawed when it doesn't achieve its goals? Does Clerks really suffer from Kevin Smith's unimaginative, plain, ultra low-budget and completely standard approach to filming it? Similarly, is Suspiria really in any way dependent on any of the things it's criticized for? No, it really isn't. The plot in Suspiria is nothing more than glue holding together several lengthy, stylized, and frankly bloody brilliant horror set-pieces, and does it really matter if it's preposterous? Do I care if it makes any sense for this bizarre gathering of witches to suddenly become a dance school? Do I care why these murders are happening? Hell no. Absolutely not. Why should anyone care? It's absurd to even bother! Suspiria is all about the mood, the atmosphere, the music, the stunningly-filmed and set up murders, the simply awesome use of color, the nightmarish quality of the whole thing, Argento's wonderful compositions and use of space, let alone the eerie feel of the whole thing which results from the printing of the film using the old three-strip Technicolor process. You can't even call it a triumph of style over substance because there's no substance for the style to triumph over. Sure, you can bang on about conceptual metaphors and what not but really it's just a bunch of nonsense isn't it? Surely Argento knew this?That doesn't really change much when discussing this film, though, because it's really quite frankly brilliant. It's an outstandingly successful, stunning bit of film-making, with great care taken in composing shots, in lighting scenes, in the use of color, in the construction and setting up of the big kills. If you define a flaw as a hindrance in reaching the goals a film has then Suspiria simply has none. It's a nightmare on film for just over 90 minutes. Sure, it's a bit too fun to really reflect a nightmare, but it's just as involving, as creepy, as spooky, as bizarre as one. Aside from being visually stunning there's the brilliant score by Goblin, and the wonderful lead performance from Jessica Harper to enjoy. Having heard so much about Suspiria from just about everyone on the internet, in my personal life, on television, etc. Does it live up to expectations? I don't know if it's just my expecting something a bit on the overpraised, crappy side or what, but Suspiria simply owned my soul for 90 minutes. It's the most gloriously entertaining, involving, and fun movie I've seen in a while. I didn't take my eyes off the screen for one second and sat, mouth agape, staring at this preposterously amazing film. Suspiria hits all the right spots, avoids all the pitfalls one normally expects from something like this, and boasts some of the best goddamn horror scenes I've ever seen. The scene with the man in the square manages to create such tension, such abnormal tension out of basically nothing and the payoff is greater than one could ever imagine. Actually, I just described Suspiria as best it can be described Argento builds this unbearable tension then pays it off, and the payoff is better with every successive set-piece. 9.5/10 "},{"Title":"Visually a good movie but pacing wise...","Date":"18 May 2005","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" JESSICA HARPER stars as a woman who enrolls in a European ballet school that unfortunately is owned by a coven of witches that start to trim down the student body one by one in grisly violent fashion & she may be next!.

Followed by two sequels starting with (in my opinion) the much better, scarier INFERNO PROLOX TRIVIASupposedly co-writer & actress DARIA NICOLODI (Who was Argento's wife at the time) based this on an actual event that happened to her grandmother (A Parisian Jewess who worked with Cocteau) who was sent to learn the piano at a school near Basel, only to quickly find out that she was being trained in black magic rather than the piano! The third film in the series was originally supposed to be TENEBRAE, but that film instead turned out to be another of Argento's giallio films that he kick started his career with. The Third film, THE THIRD MOTHER MOTHER OF TEARS followed 27 years later in order to complete this trilogy, that was virtually pronounced dead in all that time.Nicolodi herself attempted to complete the trilogy with director LUIGI COZZI a few years after INFERNO (Part 2) by writing a film called OUT OF THE DEPTHS, but as realized by Cozzi, the film was nothing but a shambolic mess, with URBANO BARBERINI & FLORENCE GUERIN playing thinly disguised Argento/Nicolodi figures, Nicolodi later disowned that film & it was later released by Cannon films & retitled THE BLACK CAT in order for them to keep up with their EDGAR ALLAN POE adoptions.**1/2 stars "},{"Title":"So so","Date":"20 July 2004","Score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":"     A young American dance student Suzy Bannion(Jessica Harper) is on her way to a famous European ballet school.When she arrives,She see's a young girl running from the school,terrified.Momenets later,Her and her friends are murder.After strange occurances and more murders,Suzy soon begins to think there is something wrong with the school,And finds out its horribly secret....

It does have it's scary moments but the surrounding story is quite dull and you'll find yourself wishing the director (Dario Argento) would put more scares in the film.  The film has 3 good moments too it, one at the beginning, middle and the all too brief end.  The movies main problem is that there isn't much plot to hold the scare scenes together.  Had the main character actually investigated the strange goings on then perhaps the movie would have been more interesting as she found clues to the schools secret.  The problem is that all of the investigating has already been done for her and it is just a matter of time before she is told all she needs to know.  The telling isn't very interesting and you wonder how the information was gathered in the first place.  To top it off there aren't many strange happenings going on anyway (that the viewer sees) so you have to wonder why an investigation takes place at all.  So in the end that viewer just has to take it for granted that strange occurrences have been happening at the school for awhile.On the good side the film does have an interesting musical score although it tends to get in the way of actually being able to hear important noises and pieces of dialogue in the movie, but it is creepy so serves it's purpose.  Argento's use of the camera is interesting but not enough to save an otherwise dull film.A better revelation of what is going on at the school might have increased the suspense level.  By the time Argento gets around to said revelation the film is almost over and everything is wrapped up quite quickly.Overall Suspiria has a few good moments but lacks in story.  It's a fine idea for a horror film but it's story matter is wasted.  You'll find yourself asking many why questions and getting very few because answers.

Spoilers contained in this review...!This film is a prime example of how important the PLOT is. Argento apparently gets his ideas from writing down his own nightmares, but he could have gone to the trouble of ADAPTING this particular nightmare. To be fair, the ending is tied up as far as the usual baddies identified & killed (& building destroyed for good measure) type of ending, but it was never made apparent exactly WHAT the coven of witches had been doing. The only bad acts committed were the murders of people who knew too much, but it was never explained whether all they knew about was the EXISTENCE of the coven, or WHAT IT WAS THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING. The only clue we are given is when the paranormal expert professor says that the aim of witches is to accumulate wealth (which not only is news to me, but never figured in the movie). He also said that a coven had a head-witch and was helpless once the leader was killed (this also is news to me). Why is there a need to invent conventions about witches, when there is plenty of perfectly cinematic and plotworthy mythology in existence. There is a suggestion that the hearts were removed from the bodies of two of the murder victims, but, again, this was never made clear or followed up on.There were so many other things wrong that I can hardly be bothered to list them all but... What was done to the blind pianist's guide-dog when it was first approached (never explained)? The murder of the pianist was actually quite well done, but WHY did they murder him? They accused his dog of having bitten the boy (never clear whether this was true) and sacked him, then he muttered about having heard things (WHAT things? WHEN WAS THIS?). Having proved that the coven could kill from afar by hidden means (the pianist), how come the first murder of the runaway girl was so messy and dramatic? Multiple stabbing seemed unnecessary, plus the subsequent dropping of the corpse from a great height with a rope tied around the neck was surely likely to draw the attention of the police. Oh, and her head would have come off if dropped from that height. The third death was a bit odd as well was that barbed wire or razor wire that she fell into? Is just looked like plain wire to me, and she didn't seem to get any extra cuts or scratches from it, and even if she did, can you die from that? Oh, and what was all that with the maggots falling from the ceiling and all the girls then having to sleep together in the main hall? WHAT WAS THE POINT? Just so that the girls could hear the head-witch's wheezy breathing? Or so that the witches could be close to the girls for some reason? Nothing explained, again. Oh, and why did they keep drugging the main girl every night? Why just her? Did they have a special plan for her? If so, WHAT? Oh, and what was that bat in aid of? Was it just a coincidental real bat? Or was it a supernatural bat (sent to do WHAT EXACTLY?).The only definitely supernatural things that happened were 1) The head-witch's longevity (woop-de-doo!). 2) The head-witch's appearance at the window of the first victim (teleportation? broomstick? changed into a bat? leg-up?). 3) The mind-control over the dog (nice surprise, but how was this achieved? Maybe a mysterious shot suggesting the coven in session would have been nice here? Or at any other point in the film?). 4) The head-witch's invisibility (again, woop-de-doo! and why did she just carry on sitting in the same place she had last been seen? DUH!). 5) The spell cast on Susie via the flashing blade in the hallway (which just made her have a bit of a funny turn). Oh yes, a masterpiece of the supernatural this.I thought this was going to be one of those films where everything seemed very confusing, but you carry on watching it anyway (even though the acting is pretty poor) because it looks/sounds good, and because you assume everything (or at least SOME THINGS) will be explained at the end, but, be warned, IT ISN'T!On the plus side, Argento's shot-composition, lighting and use of colour are rather splendid, but that's really not enough to make up for the above shortcomings.

But the colours, there just fantastic, each frame is a rich tapestry of deep red's, green's and blues, working towards Argento's hidden meanings. The editing is also good, cut to the loud clanging rhythm of Goblin's rock score, and it really creates a form of terror rarely seen in most horror films.

While I don't agree with that statement, I won't deny its sheer craft. Suspiria is an all-around beautiful film to look at. Director Dario Argento's use of color, especially green and red, are nothing short of mesmerizing. The production design is lavish and detailed, and the composition of certain shots are just magnificent. Its palpable sense of atmosphere should also be commended, as some scenes really do convey the horror of the characters' situation.It's a shame, then, that not more attention was paid to its characters, story, and screenplay. The story unfolds very slowly, and it works for the most part. The buildup is really good, which kept me interested in what's happening. However, the film does run a bit too slow at times. The heroine doesn't figure out the mystery until the last 20 minutes of the film, although it's quite obvious where things are going. Even the soundtrack gives everything away; the chorus shouts Witch! every chance they get. Maybe I'm just biased towards strong female characters, but Jessica Harper's performance as the weak and oblivious Suzy made it hard for me to root for her. Following her revelation, the film fizzles out fairly quickly. After this great buildup, we are treated with a climax that is so disappointing, we are left wondering what was so evil and powerful about the old witch in the first place.The film's worst offender, ironically, is what made the film so memorable the blaring soundtrack by Goblin. Some call it beautiful. Others call it haunting. I call it an assault to the senses. At times, I found the score to be so overbearing, it detracted me from certain parts of the film. Despite my negative attitude towards the soundtrack, there is a charming quality to it that makes it unique and memorable.There are many things to love about Suspiria. For me, it would be its technical aspects. I have rarely seen a horror film that looked this damn good. However, appearances can only do so much. Only if you bother to look underneath the surface, you will find a screenplay that isn't up to par, a story that isn't very substantial, and characters that aren't particularly deep. But damn, is it good style.

Forget there was ever a Scream trilogy or a Freddie Krueger.  Film production costs are low and the special effects, to say the least, are underdeveloped.In 1968, Roman Polanski introduces to popular culture the occult classic, 'Rosemary's Baby'.  In 1973, William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' gives audiences worldwide another reason to sleep with the lights on.  These two films are pivotal in the development of horror as we know it, yet very different in form.  It's the European influence of Polanski versus the stylings of American filmmaker Friedkin that draws this division.'Suspiria' has received some pretty rotten reviews by our fellow IMDb commentators.  The negative opinions vary in reasoning but I believe if we travelled back in time to 1977, without benefit of prior knowledge of current filmaking, perceptions would change.Directed and co-written by Italian filmmaker Dario Argento, 'Suspiria' is a product of 1977 European horror and therefore should not be reviewed with the jaundiced eye of today's standards.Compared to much of the horror of its day, there are some points where 'Suspiria' could use some refining.  It is in need of better developed dialogue and a more climactic ending.  But the build up to the end isn't entirely anticlimactic, it's true to the story told.  It's Argento's use of sight and sound that make this an important horror film for its time.Argento's use of imaginative sets is almost Kubrickian in nature. The colors are bold and the architecture is stunning.  Every shot of this film is carefully choreographed to add to the film's suspenseful atmosphere.  And I can't say enough about the eerie foreboding of Goblin's soundtrack, omnipresent throughout the feature.Some will dismiss Argento's use of green and red lighting as cheese factor, but if this film is seen on good quality DVD and the proper perspective of the time is applied, then one may truly see the value in it's creation of dark imagery.Yes, 'Suspiria' is dated.  But it's artfully directed.  That's what makes it a classic within the genre and a must see for any true horror fan.

Yeah. His worst must be so wretched that it beats out all of the most incompetent, dismal and unscary horror flicks ever gathered together into one lump sum.From my perspective - There was just so much predictability and stupidity about Suspiria's less-than-frightening story that I don't exactly know where start off with my complaints.But, you can bet that there's one thing for sure - This utterly shallow picture took the likes of Witchcraft/Horror movies to a whole new level of dumbness like you wouldn't ever believe possible.For one thing - Suspiria (which certainly took itself and its artsy/fartsy-ness way too seriously) contained, in its uncensored state, no gratuitous sex or nudity, whatsoever. And, as far as I'm concerned, this was definitely the sort of film that literally cried out for this type of distraction in order to compensate for all of the nonsensical heavy-handedness that prevailed throughout.To be sure - Suspiria (with all of its bad acting and cardboard, cut-out characters) was a bona-fide thumb-twiddler of the highest order.I think that Argento's repeated use of the red/blue/green colored lighting schemes in countless scenes showed a director of really bad taste and a decidedly limited imagination.And, finally - I think that above all of my other complaints, Suspiria suffered considerably from its musical score which was written and performed by the Italian, pop-wimps The Goblins. Far too often this discordant and annoyingly over-loud music gave away any surprises that lay in store for the viewer long before they actually took place.All-in-all - I would never, ever recommend Suspiria (with all of its super fake-looking blood) to anyone whom I personally respected. If this film is really supposed to be a cult classic, then it's got to be one of the most shamefully over-rated examples of its kind that I've seen in a mighty long, long time.Yeah.So there.

I think he is one of the most original and interesting horror directors, and his films are usually superb from a technical point of view. There is always at least two or three sequences or shots that are simply outstanding. 'Suspiria', possibly his most acclaimed movie, is no exception. The opening sequence alone of Jessica Harper's cab ride in a rainstorm makes this a must see. But I have to admit after re-watching this about a month ago for the first time in about ten years, I was disappointed. It didn't impress me much this time around, and all I could focus on was its flaws. Many people have commented how Argento is generally more concerned about atmosphere than plot, and that he isn't an actor's director, and that is my main problem with 'Suspiria'. It is an extended mood piece and is best approached as a cinematic nightmare ala Herk Harvey's 'Carnival Of Souls' or David Lynch's masterpieces 'Blue Velvet' and 'Lost Highway'. Because as a HORROR movie it fails for me personally. I simply don't find it frightening. I know I'm in the minority on that score, and ditto with me finding (the usually outstanding) Goblin's music irritating and distracting.However, while I think 'Suspiria' is flawed, I would by no means totally dismiss it. It is compulsory viewing for fans of fantastic cinema, and probably the best introduction to Argento's work.

Somewhere along the line, during the viewing of this turkey, I had for the first time the impression that he was taking me for an imbecile; or for a 5-year old kid. Someone who would start jumping excitedly at sight of the lights in bright primary colors flung at him from the screen. Come on, I have seen better lightning effects in our subway system. Some people have said that the best part comes at the beginning, with those two killings, but I'd say that they rather show how tacky, nonsensical and shallow the whole movie is (even though I reckon I loved to see Pat running across the forest, I don't know why). About those two girls, they are true dolls but the dear things wouldn't look convincing slipping on a banana peel. And why in Heavens Pat would get even closer to the window and stick her face to the glass AFTER she has seen that awful vision in the outside? That's the kind of stupidity characters will keep doing over and over again in this movie. The whole killing scene that ensues is gross and totally lacking in subtlety, more proper to a filmmaker deprived of any talent, incapable of create an atmosphere of fear with subtle clues, foreboding (which makes the claim here by some Argento fans, that he's the Italian Hitchcock, the most ridiculous thing that has ever been said in film History). And later at the School, what about that inane hissing confrontation between the two girls, in a clumsy attempt to rip off from Fellini's Satyricon? (there is an identical confrontation there, during the roman orgy). And about the episode of the old woman and the kid who directs a beam of light in Suzy's face with some object? I'm not even talking about the possible meaning of it--given that it could have been put there to create a certain feeling&#x97;but to the fact that it was unable to evoke in me the slightest feeling or impression. But the nonsensical just keep piling up Is the worm invasion supposed to mean something? We'll never know. We only know that it will serve as a pretext for Argento to put all the girls together in the gym, where they'll sleep surrounded by his cherished bright red. One thing I notice right then is that, up to this point the movie HAS NO STRUCTURE, NOT PURPOSE. Everybody there could have risen from their beds at that moment, taken their personal belongings and gone home with no consequences whatsoever. They actually could have done it, as nobody was being forced to stay there, so there was no tension in the situation. So, at the 45 minutes mark the whole thing was still at point zero, if we exclude the two initial killings; which were of no consequence anyway, as nobody seemed to notice the girls' demises. But the ridiculous reaches the sublime later, in that silly argument between Miss Tanner and the blind pianist--but I reckon she's pretty funny screaming Good riddance!--which has no other purpose than serve as excuse for the next graphic, gruesome but utterly phony looking killing. Here Argento show us once more how little he knows, or cares, about human body's reactions to traumatic injuries. We had already enough proof of that when Pat's body drops a good dozen meters, hanging from the neck, without being decapitated. The blind pianist keeps his eyes sharply focused--which makes him look like a madman&#x97;while the dog helps himself with the man's neck, ignoring that in that situation they would have rolled up, turning white, as he loses conscience. That's the first reaction to a traumatic injury the eyes lose their focus and the victim loses control of his body's movements. The process by which the next girls is killed is even more stupid. The killer is trying to push up the latch on the door, and what does she do, instead of pushing it downward? She looks at it terrorized and then she goes to take refuge in a corner, rolling herself there! Man, only for that we can predict this girl won't go very far in life. And what about the room full of wire, simple, innocuous wire. That is the nadir in the whole movie and one of the most nonsensical scenes in the annals of cinematographic horror here we see someone defeated, condemned, by a few inoffensive rolls of wire lying around (you can clearly see it's ordinary wire, even though it may be meant to represent barbed one, who knows). Not to mention the clumsy assassination attempt later by the fat vampire, which rather than scare, or even alarm me, made me wonder how he ever managed to keep airborne. A true Garfield on wings, he should have never been capable of taking off her perch or tree. Ah, I was forgetting, that horrible soundtrack which makes things even worse, as all it does is overwhelm and annoy the senses rather than to help create an atmosphere. All in all, the best example of what some reviewers here have appropriately called Eurocrap; i.e. the work of pretentious continentals that are convinced that every one of them can be a Picasso, a Fellini, and that we have to put in a pedestal any piece of crap they'll deign to fling as us. 2/10.

The others weren't that bad but each of them took quite some build-up so that's good.The other thing I liked was female driven and pretty nice setting, really colorful especially towards the end. The mystery unraveling I always like that even though I knew pretty early on that the teachers and personnel were into witchcraft. That they put something in the girl's food to make her feel weak and tired reminded me a bit of Rosemary's Baby.But there were also some things I didn't like. The music I dunno if that is typical Argento but a times I think it was overdone while the atmosphere visually was good enough the music almost killed it. Biggest pain point for me was the storyline, I thought that was pretty weak. The characters stay pretty bland throughout the movie even the main actress. Also the ending seems rushed and quite easy solution. It's witchcraft all right but I think there must be better movies out there dealing with this theme.While it did have its strong points, as a story person I expected something more.

Thankfully Dario keeps away from the cheesy porn music that many Italian films tend to incorporate within their films.

The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't need gore to carry it.The directing is fantastic, the use of colour is wonderful and real adds a surreal feel to the film that brings an unconscious creepiness, it feels like you re trapped with in a bad dream.

A subgenre so distinct it gets its own name. The origin is Italian, and the films are characterized by unsettling atmosphere, abrupt audio cuts, insane quick-zooms into random objects, and of course, lots of blood. There are three directors that can be referred to as something of a holy trinity of giallo the Father, Mario Bava, the Son (Lucio Fulci), and he who must be the Holy Ghost, Dario Argento.Tonight, I consumed Argento's most famous film, Suspiria, the story of an American ballet dancer coming to study abroad at a prestigious academy in Italy. Almost immediately, strange things start happening. I'd go on, but that's literally all the plot we get. The tip on Argento is that he puts the 'gore' in 'gorgeous', and boy does this film ever deliver. The start of this film is not the story (watch the trailer, it has nothing to do with the film whatsoever), but the luscious, dazzling visuals. The opening sequence alone is such a sensory explosion; it has so many striking color schemes clashing with each other and somehow working that set decorators and cinematographers could study it for an entire semester. Almost never is naturalistic light utilized, and every scene is bathed in a different synthetic, supernatural light that the film manages to provide almost nothing of substance and still be extremely disquieting.Then suddenly a blind man is inexplicably murdered by his dog, and the film downshifts into a simultaneous combination infodump/slasher movie, as the mystery was made clear and the film started endlessly killing off cypherous side characters no one cared about. I was still interested in the film, but it was no longer the rapturous, offputting sensuality the film was pumping out by the gallon earlier on.Italian horror is one of the few areas of the film universe where I am still sorely lacking, so I'm glad to have seen another, and Suspiria was a clear improvement over my first Argento, his underwhelming, diffusive debut, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. I've seen the handful of really big, famous, obvious ones now, but oddly enough, the best giallo I've seen BY FAR was the least heralded Pupi Avati's marvelous The House with the Laughing Windows. So that's my hope for this review If nothing else, I hope it intrigued you enough to see that excellent, underseen flick. Then, if you like that, maybe you can move on to Suspiria.But get that one first.Grade 8.25/10 (B+/B) / #10 (of 22) of 1977 "},{"Title":"a disappointment","Date":"11 December 2007","Score":"0 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" I watched this movie because one of my friends told me it was among his favourite five horror movies.

Jessica Harper brings the right amount of innocence and charm to the lead role. It's key that her character works as for the most part she's on screen. And Harper gives an excellent performance. She's giving strong support from the rest of the cast.The look of the film is stunning. The use of colours, especially the reds, is incredible. It makes the film, while without doubt a horror film, seem almost like a fairy tale. In fact if you consider the opening voice-over during the credits, it does give the feel of an adult fairytale.But then we get to the two most important things about Suspiria. The soundtrack and Argento himself. The music by the band Goblin, with a credit for Argento is stunning. Even without the images and listening to it on it's own is an unsettling feeling. But put together with the images Argento puts on screen? Then you get a truly nightmare feel.For me this is Argento at the height of his power. The opening twelve minutes of the film are amongst the most stunning put in any film I've seen, not just horror films. And while the rest of the film doesn't quite match the start, it comes close, right up to the unsettling ending.Although not known at the time, Suspiria became the first film of what is knowing as the 'Three Mothers' trilogy.

But (and it's a John Candy-sized but) the film, just like all the other Argento efforts I've watched, just leaves me cold.Key question for a scary movie - is it scary? Nope. The director has a few good moments (making an airport sliding door intimidating - that's clever) but they're so interspersed with long periods of blandness that they can't maintain any effect. Even the death scenes - not scary. The blind pianist being mauled by his own dog? Laughable. I know special effects in 1977 weren't exactly Avatar standard but surely they could have shelled out a few extra quid for a fake dog's head that actually looked vaguely like a dog's head? Very little plot - no problem with that - but what little there was got mangled by an atrocious language track.Not to say that this is a movie entirely without merit.

This film had none of those three. Instead what I got was a classy kind of horror movie with some very atmospheric shots and amateurish production. I'm sure some people are going to down vote me for that last statement (which I honestly could care less about) but just hear me out. The melodrama in this movie was really something else. The main character would stare at the camera with her buggy eyes for 30 seconds or so for no apparent reason after someone was talking to her. I'm not sure what the point of this was. During one of the chase scenes the suspenseful music stops and the girl trips when stacking suitcases by a window. Neither of these added to the mood, they detracted from it. There is little left to say besides these scenes being amateurish.The atmosphere of the film is very strange. And how the viewer is supposed to interpret it is kind of ambiguous. We are constantly hearing screaming noises and flashing green and red lights throughout the movie. The characters don't seem to notice these things, but they are not the least bit subtle. I didn't really go for this too much. I'm sure people with disagree, but they are probably fans of the director (apparently he has a cult following of sorts) and don't appreciate reason. The film did have some good suspenseful scenes. The way the music builds up and interleaves with the characters' actions in climatic scenes is mostly well done.All in all you should see this if you like ballerina's and maggots.

I love films that do a steady buildup of suspense, but this one just didn't cut it. Yes, visually there was something completely haunting, and yes, the score was kind of creepy, but I thought it did a terrible job of building tension.Some of the acting was awful, the friend of the main girl in particular. It's hard for me to feel scared for someone when my brain is screaming oh somebody kill her already! She kept flipping out about all these little things. I got that she was scared, but I didn't have any idea what was so menacing about the situations that she kept flying of the handle about. So the teachers aren't going home, OK, why is that really a big deal. There was just this leap into fear that made her emotions seem irrational, and therefore, didn't make me feel frightened.My other issue with the characters is that they didn't seem too bright. To me it seemed obvious that the girl was yelling to someone inside the school. Why would anyone mumble that loud into an open door? All of their ah ha! moments seemed more like yeah, so?s And who in their right mind would stack boxes like that?! The final nail on the spine tingle coffin was the music. At first the song was so eerie that I really enjoyed it, but later it just seemed so loud. I couldn't make out footsteps. I couldn't make out breathing. There were times when I felt like they heard someone talking only to realize it was part of the song. Other times I didn't know if they were purposefully blocking out dialogue to add to the mystery or if there was actually just silence (pool scene if you were wondering). Ultimately it became a big distraction from the buildup, covering up the subtle terror of the quiet. The girls are creeping around and scared, but I can't even tell if they're in danger because I can't hear anyone coming... which made it so hard to put myself in their shoes.Suspiria is in many ways a beautiful film, but to me, a flop as a movie.

In my view, this film is a suck city production hardly worth the investment in celluloid and paper mache. An exercise in cinematic chaos that only an Italian director could get away with. Alright, to be fair, Suspiria does exude a certain flair through its use of color, lighting and soundtrack that keep it just this side of the to-be-burned trash bin. But in cinema, any cinematic genre, there are basic things that we commonly refer to as 'story' and 'editing' that are utterly missing from this kaleidoscopic jumble of images. It is as if they'd had a few grappas one night and someone got out the scissors, asked for the blindfolds and said, 'How about doing it in strips of five feet?' They could have run this film backwards and it really wouldn't have made much of a difference. Amongst the numerous WTF scenes is one where Suzy rolls a dolly into the bathroom after her phone is cut. Silver platters with a late night meal (luxury room service in a ballet school?) or trays of medicine? Who knows? She proceeds to toss half the ingredients into the toilet bowl. Superfluous close-ups that show little more than a napkin (sanitary?) and then she flushes. Next, a glass of some red substance is poured into the sink. Poisoned tomato juice, blood? It looks like paint. Why didn't she just flush it down the toilet as well like you and I would? So that she could proceed to scrub away at the now red-stained sink. Close-up again. The substance doesn't rinse away and now her hands are 'soiled'. This matter-of-fact exposition should end with a moment of drama where Suzy reacts with either frustration, anger, tears or at least curiosity. Instead Suzy saunters off nonchalantly to open a window which allows her to be duly attacked by the fat pigeon bat instead. By the way, was it only my copy, or is the sound of her whacking away at the beast timed to the upbeat when the whacking chair is above her head. Talk about sound synch!As for the horrific stilted dialogue, it reminded me of something between the narration of a Soviet travelogue and a Cliff notes-based high school play translated into English from...English by the Buenos Aires marching choir. Everyone in this movie speaks as if they had just graduated from a U.N. interpreter's institute. Flat, grammatically correct yet lacking emotional inflection. No soul, no umphh. In fact this film was probably dubbed into multiple languages using the same language school people. Bargain! The textbook dialogue peaks in the scene where the Rosa Klebb-ish ballet instructor throws Jose Feliciano the piano player out of the institute with a parting...Good Riddance. Straight out of a 1930s comedy.Family affair that this film was, Suspiria might have been tag-titled Dario vs The Argentos for the gap between a vision and its execution. It's a shame considering the money and effort that went into the Art Nouveau sets and other production values. Perhaps, this multimedia maze of a movie would better have been released as a simple slide-show with the random-sequence option permanently enabled. As it stands it's best suited for MST3K material.

It is written by him and his future wife Daria Nicolodi, who knew/knows very much about witchery and black magic, and whose granny told her many stories and fairy tales when she was a child. Nicolodi got the idea for Suspiria when she remembered one real life incident what happened to her granny, who was a famous pianist; she once went to some music academy for audition and found out that also black magic was taught there and ran away immediately. Nicolodi has refused to tell the name of that academy for safety reasons (understandably), but she is sure that the story is true and bad things were going on in that academy.Suspiria's plot is similar American ballet dancer Susy (Jessica Harper, chosen for the role when Argento noticed her in DePalma's Phantom of the Paradise) arrives in Germany to attend highly appreciated ballet school with professional and talented teachers. She finally arrives there on one rainy night, but faces horrible incident in her way to the school, as horrified girl runs out of the school in panic screaming something. Soon comes one of the most famous and incredible scenes of the film, and by that time, the film has delivered incredible amount of style, darkness and atmosphere, and it has run only 15 minutes or so. Susy finally gets to the school next day and gets to know the staff and her fellow students. Unfortunately for Susy, but fortunately for the lovers of Argento's art, the real nature of the school is soon revealed to Susy and we are going to see one of the most horrific journeys to the gates of Inferno ever. The magic has begun.The magic of cinematography - The film is hard to describe with words since it has so many elements and merits that deserve to be mentioned and analyzed. I'll begin with the visuality of the film. The camera work by the director Argento and director of photography Luciano Tovoli is uniquely brilliant as hard to shoot camera movements and wild angles give incredibly powerful and brightly original visual punch to the viewer's eyes. They used one special filming style and gels (uncommon at the time) to create the unbelievable color world, that bloom also in Argento's another masterpiece and sort of sequel to Suspiria, Inferno. Suspiria's photography is mainly about colors, and also from long distance shots to extreme close ups, which are at their most brilliant in the guard dog scene at night. Tovoli said this particular scene was very difficult to shoot as it was night time and the lightning was hard to create. The colors and cinematography are one of the most important elements in Suspiria, and I think Argento's and Tovoli's co-operation in this film is among the strongest collaborations ever in the field and history of horror cinema.The magic of music - As important element as the photography in this film is, is Claudio Simonetti's and his music band Goblin's soundtracks and world created by music. It consists of different sounds like whispers, different and exotic instruments and of course the unique and immortal theme that starts in the very beginning of the credits and leaves the viewer only when the final frame of this unforgettable horror opera is rolled away. I can't mention any other horror movie that has an equally incredible use of music and an ability to create an equal feeling of horror and fear with the power of images and music. Suspiria demands to be seen and heard in big screen, but it is still very powerful experience in home and from video, too. Suspiria's soundtrack is the proof that Goblin is one incredible rock group and Suspiria's music is one of their greatest achievements, as they have admitted themselves, too. Fear has never been described this effectively before and after Suspiria, and Goblin is as important maker here as the director himself, and Dario himself appreciates music very much and always participates in the composing of his films' music. All the Goblin soundtracks are very great as they have composed atmospheric and immortal music for films like Profondo Rosso (Argento), Dawn of the Dead (George Romero) and Contaminazione (Luigi Cozzi); their music has no comparison in other horror film composers and since music is so important element in cinema, Goblin is among the most important pieces of history of this genre.The magic of details and scenes, very often dealing with water and colors - I have one particular segment in this film that is the one that sense-shocked me the most and stayed in my mind forever, and so is above all the other segments and pieces of cinematic power of this film. In the beginning when Susy arrives in Germany, the rain and water is captured so stunningly that it is impossible to make full justice with words. The zooms to flushing rapids/water falls and swallowing street drain are the kind of elements that make films like David Lynch's Lost Highway, Eraserhead and Takashi Miike's Audition so powerful the things that are not scary or threatening by themselves have been made very ominous and alive with the tools of cinema. The water in this beginning of Suspiria is among the greatest elements in the whole film, and the fact is that these details won't be revealed fully when first seen, as I noticed these incredible moments fully when I watched the film for a second time. Later on there is another little detail depicting water as it flushes down the drain when Susy is in her room. Water, colors and both together are the details Argento uses as greatly as possible and Suspiria shows this more powerfully than Inferno, which also has brilliant colors and water. The film is full of details, that almost all deal with colors someway, and this is the kind of cinema that can be and must be seen over and over again and it gives something new always and never becomes seen completely.The magic of atmospheric and beautiful, yet very hellish terror - There are horror scenes in Suspiria, that simply will haunt the viewer days and years after, and the most gruesomely effective scene is the maggot scene. Maggots and worms.. They are often depicted as the lowest form of life and so it is understandable they're used in here as an element of total terror and forthcoming opening of the gates of Hell, and the scene of maggot filled attic and old coffin stayed in my mind almost as powerfully as the mentioned water usage in the beginning of the film. The maggots are far more threatening than in Lucio Fulci's Paura Nella Citta dei Morti Viventi, a otherwise great horror film which has also a scene involving huge amount of maggots. The faces of characters are very important here as Argento uses very much a close ups of faces and face expressions. Jessica Harper does great acting since she is the focus in most of the scenes, and her face is full of innocence and childlike undisturbedness throughout the film, and she never shows signs of nervousness or other things connected to bad acting. But the most memorable faces are the ones that depict the forthcoming horror. The mysterious servant Pavlos and the mother and son are among the characters of evil that haunt throughout the film and as they keep silent all the time, it becomes far more disturbing. The scene where Susy is blinded by shining piece of glass by the mother/son duo, is again among the most memorable pieces of the film.The magic of all the aforementioned magic put together - Suspiria is perhaps the greatest Italian horror film, and is in my opinion ever greater than Mario Bava's often hailed masterpiece La Maschera del Demonio. Still these both films are masterpieces and I don't feel a need to compare them in any way. Suspiria's power lies in its music and visuality, so if I had to mention three most important characters that have created Suspiria this wonderful, I'd say Argento, Tovoli and Simonetti. Daria Nicolodi is also important as she gave her knowledge to the screenplay, but still I'd mention those three without leaving anyone out. The scenes of violence are horrific, but very aesthetic and never gratuitous or unnecessarily explicit. The opening double murder is among the most fierce murder scenes ever filmed and it wouldn't be as near as powerful without the Goblin music. The violence in Suspiria is perhaps little more symbolic and un-graphic than in Argento's other films, but since the power of Argento's films doesn't lie in gore, I cannot and don't want to concentrate too much on the violence as his films have their real merits elsewhere; violence is only one element that is handled and depicted with the power and magic of his most personal and unique styles and cinematic brilliance.People and so called horror fans tend to complain about plots in Argento films and they think always that plot is too thin or confusing or something like that. I really can't believe and understand those opinions since very often those people really don't find the real merits from Argento's films, the things Argento shows by using the plot only as a skeleton to be filled with the power of his art. If you are looking for great plot and entertaining twists and turns, forget Argento and please never judge his films without finding the real merits of them.Suspiria would be my choice among all the movies, if I had a possibility to choose one film that I would see in a movie theatre on big screen. This far, this is Argento's movie that suffers the most on television, being still very powerful and stunning experience when viewed on video. Suspiria is for horror genre what Gattaca by Andrew Niccol is for science fiction totally unique masterpiece of the genre and a film that is too often neglected or judged by wrong reasons. Suspiria is 10 out of 10 bright stars immortal classic and Argento has already earned his place in the history of cinema, alongside many other great masters in different genres, horror or non-horror.Magic is everywhere, all over the world. -Suspiria, 1977  "},{"Title":"Artsy?  Maybe.  Good?  Anything but.","Date":"18 December 2007","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","Review":" Okay. I sat down to watch this movie with a couple of my friends. I had heard it was interesting and was Dario Argento's masterpiece. I was not familiar with the director and while I'm not a huge fan of 1970s cult horror, against my better judgment I threw it into the DVD player. And then watched it. From beginning to end. Yeah. Okay. Now, first, before I go on a tirade about why and just how hard this film sucked, let me tell something to all your cult horror fans who love this movie. I understood it, it's not existential and complex, it just sucks. Just because something is bizarre, doesn't make it cool. All you artsy douche bags think that because it was rejected by mainstream media as trash, it must have some underlying genius. Somethings are just trash. And if you think I'm too Hollywood or mainstream, I like indies probably more than the next guy, but things become mainstream because they work well and i don't know... aren't giant piles of crap. Now, the plot of this film could be written out on the backside of a fortune cookie so I'll summarize it real quick. A young dancer Suzy (Jessica Harper) goes to a European dance school just as a a girl dies a gristly death and after a while realizes that the school is run by a cult of witches and the head witch is this invisible woman from the 1800s, but she's still alive (this is the kind of logic we're dealing with). Okay, did that blow your mind? It blew mine. The film grabs you with a totally bizarre and graphic opening death sequence, stabbed, hung and all kinds of crazy glass wounds. It's all down hill after that. I'll admit Suspiria has one thing going for it, Goblin offers a great soundtrack to the film, very chilling. Okay, back to why this film sucks ass. Most of the people who regard this film as a cult masterpiece because of the atmosphere it creates. Okay, the set design is creative, is it good? Hell no. Just because something looks crazy doesn't make it the best thing since sliced bread. And by the way, basking everything in technicolor lights isn't creative, it's annoying as hell. The film is visually interesting, but with the lack of plot and anticlimactic ending, it sucks on way to many counts to call this movie anything but bad. Are the deaths gory, yes but there are four of them and none are adequately explained. The villains motives are skipped over and the film just ends. I'm going to ruin it for everyone. Suzy stabs an invisible witch then the building begins to shake and bursts into flames just as she runs out the door. What about the children? Oh right, they were conveniently out at the opera or somewhere. In the end, this movie sucks. I can almost see the argument for why it's great, but I don't buy it one bit. This film is not scary unless you're on acid and atmosphere alone does not make a film. A great example of why when people think of film, they think of Hollywood, not crazy Italian drug addicts. Terrible on nearly every account.

For this, it has too many flaws. It is a good movie and I consider it as one of the best in Dario Argentos body of work. But as in other movies by the Italian horror maestro the main problem lies in the bad writing (which is even enhanced in the English version). The movie tells the story of Susie (Jessica Harper), a young American ballerina who arrives in Germany to study at a dance academy. After several bad things (including worms falling from the ceiling and of course some nasty killings) have happened there she finally finds out that it is run by witches. Yes, that's it, there is not much more of a story here!! Beyons these problems (bad writing and thin story line) Argento made a nightmarish masterpiece which he knows well how to orchestrate He uses great camera work, effective lighting and music to create atmosphere.

From about the first five minutes of Argentos first film, (The Bird with the Crystal Plumage) I was completely gripped by Darios nail-biting murder-mystery Giallo screenplay,and by his impressive,inventive directing.Whilst watching the last in his Animals Giallo trilogy (the very striking Four Flies on Gray Velvet)I noticed that Argento seemed to be injecting a bit of a supernatural undertone into the film,with the main clue that helps the lead character solve the case,being one that is very much based in Sc-Fi/supernatural horror.Whilst searching round to find out about peoples thoughts on Argentos amazing Giallos,I was caught a bit off-guard when I started to realise that Darios Giallos seem to get all the attention taken away from them,with most peoples eyes being glued to his supernatural-horror films.As I kept reading up,I began to notice that a horror of his called Suspiria seemed to be the main film that people connected Argento with.Due to now being very interest in seeing why Suspiria is such a landmark (to most people) in Argentos career,I decided that this was a film of his,that I needed to see as soon as possible.The plotAmerican student Suzy Banyon grabs a taxi to take her to a new ballet school which she will be attending.At the front entrance of the door,Suzy is startled when a girl (Pat Hingle) comes running out of the building and yells something at her (which she is unable to hear properly,due to there being a huge thunderstorm) After running away from the ballet school,Pat finds a friend who is living in the town near by,who kindly offers to let Pat stay the night.Just as Hingle is about to get into bed.She notices two strange faceless eyes staring at her through the window.Getting closer to the window to try and discover who (or what) is looking at her,an arm breaks through the glass window and,pushes Hingles head against a side window until she is dead.Having killed Pat Hingle,the murderer gets hold of her friend,who ends up getting killed in an elaborate hanging. Meanwhile at the ballet school,Suzy Banyon is starting to wonder if something a bit wrong might be happening at the school.With having been forced against her wishes to share an apartment on the campus with a student (Sarah) who she is at first not that keen on.Suzy is then left with her jaw on the ground,when the teachers fire the schools pianist,after his dog had launched an unexpected attack on one of the teachers nephews. Later on in the night when all the staff have gone home and Suzy is trying to get some sleep ,she starts to hear some very strange noises that sound like they are coming from a hidden part of the school.The next day,she goes to Sarah to ask her what the sounds are,Sarah tells Suzy that a few days before Pat ran off,Pat had been telling her that she thinks the teachers are not going home at night,but are instead doing something very disturbing in the hidden iris corridors of the school..View on the filmFor the screenplay,the influence of Argentos then new partner Daria Nicolodi (who also wrote a huge chunk of the screenplay)is extremely noticeable.Whilst women characters had played a part in Argentos Giallos (especially with his fantastic twist endings) here they are given the role of the main protagonist,compared to his earlier films where they would mostly be there to play supporting roles,to the wrongly accused man.Although this excellent film is usually called a Giallo horror,I feel that Argento shows that, with this film he has clearly moved away from murder/mystery plots by giving the film an extremely enchanting atmosphere.Whilst the screenplay is a little bit loose,the fantastic mix of a atmospheric supernatural horror (with the first 30 minutes of the film,moving at a speed that will make you breathless)with a surprising fairy tale like Innocent,which is given a very strong presence thanks to the great Red Riding Hood style performance of Jessica Harper,makes the film completely mesmerising.Looking at the directing,Argento (and overlooked cinematography Luciano Tovoli) create a true work of art,with Argento turning the film into a living dream (or nightmare) by using colours to give a powerful feeling that the school is in another world.Along with spine tingling directing and the very original screenplay,the excellent haunting music by progressive rock band Goblin makes sure that the film grabs you from the very first moment,and pulls you deep into a strange enchanting world. Final view on the filmAn amazing supernatural horror film,with an unforgettable mood and astonishingly creative directing from Argento.

It is said SUSPIRIA may be the best Italian horror flick. The story line is not really clear at times and definitely not obvious. Special effects are pretty gory and the music is really good and sets a scary atmosphere. The opening sequence is a bit mysterious, but makes sense when the finale plays out. To be exact, the final fifteen minutes or so are the best of the whole movie. The sets resemble nothing I've seen before. Shadows usually nurture fear.An American dancer enters a renowned European ballet academy to waltz into an eerie situation. A secret door is opened and leads to the discovery that the staff is a wicked coven with intentions of gaining converts. It is sensed the newcomer must be eliminated and become part of the ever growing body count. Starring are Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Alida Valli, Flavio Bucci, Udo Kier and veteran actress Joan Bennett.

It's too bad her career near the end was in schlocky films like this!This horror story, featuring witches, is not usually my cup of tea but I could see where this would have been a very interesting film had made some changes in the dialog and did a better of dubbing.

It is so amazing to me, then, that despite this and the rather predictable plot at times, the movie is so effective at scaring the viewer. So, it isn't really the plot, the acting or the special effects that make it a good film. Instead, the director, cinematographer and musical director deserve the kudos as the movie builds and builds and builds in intensity thanks almost completely to lighting and a suspenseful (though somewhat repetitive) score. Together, they create a visceral reaction that transcends the plot and acting--almost as if your mind is unaware of the terror while your body begins to react strongly with a quickening pulse and nerves that are on end.
