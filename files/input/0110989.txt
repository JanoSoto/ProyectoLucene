Well, the comic book on which it's based is not exactly Stan Lee either&#133; From a pedagogical point of view, one must say that Richie takes control of his situation in the absence of his parents, makes decisions that are largely sensible and practical, and carries them out mostly without adult help.

The movies themselves did poorly at cinemas and in critical terms.In 1994, Macaulay Culkin was 13/14 years old. He was in his early adolescence, so he was growing. A difficult phase for him. Ridiculously, people began to ignore him because of that - either that or they simply thought his cuteness was disappearing and gave him little value for that. But he always proved to be a terrific actor. True, there were many, many great child actors but he was one of them for sure. Sure, his cuteness took him far, but it was his talent that made him a legend.After playing a completely different role in the 1993 film 'The Good Son' (where he played a psychopath that could very well disguise that nature thanks to his angelical looks, a wolf in sheep's clothe), he returned to the roles of 'good guys' in all of his 1994 films.'Richie Rich' is not much of a film, but perhaps it's a little more interesting than 'The Pagemaster'. It's not a bad movie, but it's a somewhat complex film for me to give a fair rating. It has good moments but also very stupid moments, particularly from the 2nd half on (in my opinion, where the movie is at its weakest).Macaulay Culkin plays the title character. Richie Rich is rich (like his name suggests), lives in a fancy mansion surrounded by comfort and luxury and can even count with a chauffeur that takes him in his majestic and elegant Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud whenever it's necessary. But Richie realizes that there is one thing that money can't buy happiness. He feels the lack of friends and possibly bored with his tedious life. He just wants to be like the other kids.About the things I found funny in this film, a good example of that is the line «Oh my God, I look like Michael Jackson!» by Richie's mother. Come to think of it... that's not untrue - lol. I'm surprised they put this line in the film because Macaulay Culkin stars in it and considering the friendship he had with the eccentric singer... Other funny details are, for example, the cute dog that has dollar signs instead of spots and appropriately named Dollar, and the scene when Richie doesn't wanna wake up but stares at his personal trainer when he realizes what a beauty she is (she is portrayed by the supermodel Claudia Schiffer).Macaulay Culkin had everything to be a great name of the cinema. And he was, for a few years, mostly thanks to the success of the first two 'Home Alone' films. He was talented, charismatic and good-looking. Too bad he trashed his life later, but I believe he turned out to be like this because of his personal problems.

He seemed about as close to growing from boy to man as you can get, while still being a boy. His voice was deeper than in any of his movies back then, and on the verge of growing. The Rich's own $70,000,000,000, and Richie has his own Mcdonald's, extreme roller coaster, a diversion I forget what you call that launches you up in the air and lands you on a mattress, and four wheelers to name a few! Reggie Jackson is his baseball coach and Arnold is his fitness trainer! he has Herbert Cadberry, as his very likable and proper butler. Richie Miraculously possesses all this, while still being likable and not a brat. Mac may seem like a spoiled brat in real life, but I know he's a likable person, his parents just gave him it. he's not like Brad Renfro. Richie has class with a hilarious teacher played once again by Ben Stein, in the same way he plays the economics teacher that gave him his name, only funnier here. The only thing he doesn't have is friends. He meets some sandlot kids, which makes him yearn deeply for friends, so he becomes aqquainted with them. The kids include, the Mr. COOL kid, the overweight kid that eats a lot, the jock, and one that seems stuck-up and bossy until a little later. the villain is the industries top executive, Laurence Van Dough (John Larroquette) who arranges for Richie and his parents to be killed in a plane by a bomb, but Richie wasn't even in it, and his parents survive by floating on the inflatable boat. The action is great and goes on for a long time with violence and weapons, and Cadberry dresses up like a gangster, high tech spying, fatal suspense in the science lab, and a great climax on Mt.

As usual, there were some good things, but some not so good things as well.THE GOOD THINGS 1) Macaulay Culkin, personally I think he is better an actor than people give him credit for. He is one of the main reasons why I love the first two Home Alone movies so much. Here, he gives a very spirited lead performance, admittedly not as cute as he was when he was starring in underrated gems like Uncle Buck, but he shows once again what a talented actor he was.2) Jonathan Hyde as the butler comes very close to stealing the show, a very funny and sly performance. Also Edward Hermann and Christine Ebersole give humorous performances, while John Larroquette plays the villain of the piece more than adequately.3) The scenery is quite impressive, captured well by the breezy cinematography. The Biltmore estate was gorgeous.4) The soundtrack was decent, nice background music especially.5) I liked the moral the film taught; All the money in the world can't make you happy, thinking about it that is true.THE NOT SO GOOD THINGS 1) While I liked the moral of the film, the story itself is predictable and somewhat contrived. it probably doesn't help you have seen it all before.2) The script is quite weak in general. Don't get me wrong there were some good spots like Oh my god I look like Michael Jackson! but the jokes are admittedly very silly and juvenile, and the scripting does fall in the danger of becoming clichéd.3) The pacing. Now I don't mind films that move fast. I do have more of a problem if the pacing is TOO fast, despite the feel good nature of the film, and its valiant attempt to rise above superficial material, the film feels a little too rushed, the ending particularly felt skimmed over.4) The characters feel rather stereotypical. Maybe that is an unfair complaint as it probably couldn't be avoided, but I couldn't help thinking yeah I recognise that type of character.Overall, definitely not a bad film, worth watching at least once, but I personally didn't find it that great. 5/10 Bethany Cox "},{"Title":"Interesting adaptation","Date":"18 November 2006","Score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":" The comic is older then I am, but it still stands the test of time.

With a role virtually crafted for him, this movie seems like it was made for the sole purpose of capitalising on the waning youth of the growing star Macaulay Culkin, star of box office smashes like Home Alone 1 and 2 (now those were funny).Richard 'Richie' Rich is the richest boy in the world, and sole heir to the bazillions of dollars owned by his fathers company / huge-amalgated-yet-somehow-wholesome-corporation.  It follows a pivotal period in the young gazillionare's life, as he attempts to make friends while at the same time defend his fathers company from an evil and ambitious...guy, high ranking employee Lawrence Van Dough (an excellent villain performance from John Larroquette..whoever the hell that is), who attempts to kill Richie's parents while they're flying through the Bermuda Triangle.Richie struggles to maintain a sickeningly wholesome stranglehold over his company, while Van Dough attempts to remove all obstacles.I'll try not to spoil too much.. Relatively humourous gags like the whoopass butler Herbert, and some nice juxtaposition with scenes like the kids rollerblading through a hall filled with men in suits.  The movie also raises some fundamental questions about material wealth and...friend wealth (you know what I mean), which doesn't answer the questions so much as cover them up with roller coasters, a personal McDonalds and the 'Kidapult'.Culkin manages to look like Draco Malfoy or a cousin of the Addams Family throughout the film, which would help to explain his initial difficulty in making/obtaining friends. Speaking of which, his friends are practically dirty urchin robots, who's job of delivering cliched one-liners (generic fat boy  hey, these gumballs are free!) would've been performed just as easily by cardboard cut-outs.Professor Keenbean and the Rich parents give some humorous performances, like the use of Keenbean's sticky black adhesive, and the smell detector which reveals the dynamite hidden in the Rich's plane.The closing scene to the movie shows Richie playing baseball with his new pals, bonded, or rather, scripted, together by the conflict and all those persuasive material possessions of Richie's that we have unfortunately just born witness to, in what could be the most stunningly mediocre 95 minutes of our life.Everybody is happy  Richie has 'pals', his parents are alive, and even the butler gets some nookie, but then again, the sculptor is distraught at having her giant masterpiece Mt Richmore torn apart by a huge laser, Professor Keenbean is still stuck to the floor of his lab (as far as we know), Van Dough is gardening, fortunately just as unquestionably evil as ever, and Macaulay Culkin has just starred in his last major role before enduring the painfully ...'textured' years of puberty.

Unfortunately, nothing else begged much attention in terms of how Richie Rich conducts itself as a piece of family entertainment. Is it serviceable? Absolutely. Just prepare for a rather long and tedious ninety-four minutes. Kids will appreciate it, seeing their favorite hero from Home Alone getting into more hairy little circumstances, but the true victims, the parents, will likely be contemplating better things they could be doing with their time.Make no mistake; I was enjoying Richie Rich for about forty-five minutes on a simply, passable level. Then at the hour mark, I grew restless, and by the finale, I was shaking my head at the missed opportunity the film could've capitalized on. I'll come back to this later. The story is inspired from the comic-book character who made quite the name for himself in books and strips that I never found myself reading. He is played by Macaulay Culkin, who was born to Richard and Regina Rich (Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole), a couple worth a dollar over $70 billion thanks to their immensely successful Rich Industries. The three live in a house that appears to be sitting two full-size golf courses, and embrace their wealthy status in the way of philanthropy, and not personal narcissism.While Richie enjoys living a lavish life, traveling in helicopters, playing basketball in doors, and carrying thousand-dollar bills in his wallet, he greatly envies the lives of regular, middle-class children, who have very little priorities and can spend their days playing baseball in an open sandlot.With this kind of setup, you'd think the film would be on the track of setting up a lonely rich boy sort of moral, emphasizing that all the money in the world can't buy true, wholesome companionship, right? Well, just as we're about to further dive into that, a pesky plot point involving corruption, attempted-murder, and industry takeover begins to plague the Rich family, and with rumor that his parents are dead after a nice pack of TNT was on their private plane, Richie assumes the role as the CEO of the company. But just as we're about to go further into that detail, we focus on one of Richard Rich's employees, who tried to murder the couple and their kid to take over Rich Industries for himself. Not if Richie and his loyal butler Herbert Cadbury (Jonathan Hyde) can help it, though.Right off the bat, we just passed up two solid directions this film could've taken instead of the contrived, foreseeable one it settled on. Yet if there's one thing that can't be overlooked about this film, it's the abundance of character-actors, who all do a capable job of doing what they can with what they have - especially Macaulay Culkin. Culkin's gifted, easy-going performance makes one sad that this was his last big film as a child actor, before landing roles in several under-performing independent films before fading into tabloid obscurity.Co-writer of Richie Rich Neil Tolkin worked on License to Drive, a potent, lively comedy about a teen and his two friends going out after hours in his grandfather's Cadillac even after failing his driver's test. After that, he settled for very little doing both Richie Rich and the atrocious Pauly Shore comedy Jury Duty a year later. When glancing through director Donald Petrie's filmography, it appears that he has made a career out of making spur-of-the-moment comedies that usually do fairly well at the box office before becoming safe-bets on cable. He has a formula and he should stick to it. It's just sort of upsetting that Richie Rich aspires to be functional, rather than successful.Starring Macaulay Culkin, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole, Jonathan Hyde, and John Larroquette.

He's basically dirty rich and lives with his pretty nice parents who give him everything he wants, except he kind of wants to play with other kids from the street rather than the private school friends he has. The film is one of those one's you can imagine watching on a Sunday afternoon, and this can be enjoyed too but maybe it just isn't so clinical.The comedy side of the movie is really kind of non existent, it tries it really does but by the end your kind of feeling disappointed. The story I'll give it is not boring, it has it's moments where you actually are maybe rooting for Richie and his fellow friends and butler(Jonathan Hyde), but in truth it's hard to like Culkin. Our main star in this is just too unbelievable and wastes any talent he has by being a dull main character, top that also with a poor script and you have Macaulay Culkin acting and sounding like some kind of badly built robot actor. Donald Petrie directs and he is pretty average really, doesn't do enough to make the story or actors better but also the general direction Is just well, not done well enough really. Now I'm not the biggest fan of these kind of comedies, in fact most I watch I don't expect much in terms of laughter, and here is another example. One thing I am trying to say though is that this didn't bore me strangely, I mean it is still a pretty bad movie but at times interesting.Listen this is the kind of movie where at times it tries to flash it's crazy gadgets and cool rich persons items, but only really succeeds in making us the slightest bit interested in the ending. And on that point the end, actually not too bad but followed up just too poor a beginning and middle, Culkin also seems to get better but when he is sad, he just can't act at all!. Now don't watch this and expect to hate it, some could definitely enjoy it, some will hate, but always remember if this movie made you laugh because this movie labels itself as a comedy.And what about the other cast?, well not everyone is necessarily bad, Jonathan Hyde as the butler is pretty good and when he features the film can be a slight bit more interesting. John Larroquette as the scheming Van Dough is also not that bad, should have played into the jokes a bit more and maybe even have been a bit more in to what he is actually doing, kind of looks bored in this movie really.So overall a movie I found to be well, just not good really, it isn't awful just not acceptable, the kind of movie only a few will like but at least there isn't only one person who likes it. If you like your family comedies you may enjoy it, Culkin has really grown up too much for Home Alone fans to come a knocking but still if your a big fan of his then sure, give this a go.

This was never going to be a masterpiece, was it?There are some likable performances here and there - Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole as Richie's parents, Stephi Lineberg as one of the kids, Jonathan Hyde as Cadbury - but the gags are so leaden and the dialogue so terminally banal that they all struggle to breathe life into the proceedings. The writers seem to think that a rich kid being rich is novelty enough to sustain the film, which it isn't, and that having a posh English butler say things like 'Let's kick some butt' is comedy gold, which it isn't. Meanwhile Laroquette's plan of child murder, terrorism and faked suicides hardly sits well with the inconsequential, hollow tone of the rest of the movie.

Richie and his new inner-city friends must save his estate from a couple of disloyal employees who plan to whack his parents and take over the estate.Sex None Violence  Plenty of slapstick comedy.  There are several scenes of kids in peril; in one scene, a villian tries to send Richie and his friends through a subatomic recycling machine, but they are rescued in the nick of time. In another, Richie is shot at point-blank range, but is wearing a bulletproof vest.  In the climax of the movie, the Rich family is gunned at by a laser cannon worthy of Star Wars.

As a 14 year old playing the younger 12 year richest kid in the world, Culkin and his management must have realized quickly that he could not stay a child actor forever. Richie Rich, therefore became Culkin's last major project until his return to film as a 23-year-old young adult in 2003's Party Monster.In Rich, no actor is in top form. The laughs were too few and too far between, especially for a family comedy. The post-Jurassic Park CGI robot bee may have even been a hindrance rather than a creative flourish. None of the characters were developed beyond the simple caricatures we'd expect and further stripped of comedic potential. By the time the antagonist breaks into the vault, anyone over the age of 17 probably knew what was inside; that is if they hadn't already stopped paying attention and fallen asleep.Had the film starred another adolescent lead, we may have been forgiving, but the overall quality of this venture paled in comparison with the Culkin we knew from Uncle Buck, the Home Alone pictures, My Girl, and even his brief appearance in Michael Jackson's 9 minute Black or White rampage. Being that it was filmed in and around the Chicagoland area, and that this reviewer is a sucker for anything local, this reviewer feels generous giving Richie Rich 4 out of 10 IMDb stars.

My favorite scene with him is the one in The Good Son involving the cliff. I had a nice laugh with that one. Here there is no such scene and the film might as well be called Home Alone 3 this time the kids rich! as it has almost the same premise. Granted the parents did not really leave him, but rather got into an airplane crash, but it is essentially the same as that brat is in this one too. So the story is the kid is lonely and tries to make friends, parents disappear after a plane crash, some dude is trying to get all the money for himself and there is no robot like there was in the original cartoon still trying to debate if that is a bad or good thing. All I know is that the film for the most part is cringe worthy, but as I have said I can not stand Macualay at all so I am going to tend to be against anything he is in. I did not like Uncle Buck, Home Alone or any of the movies he has been in. Except for said scene, ah yes plunge to your death you spoiled sack of...ahem, the only reason I give this movie a two is that there was a joke in it that actually got me to laughing involving this laser or something blowing a chunk out of a stone statue. Other than that, barf. "},{"Title":"Typical standard moralistic comedy.

He's got it all private baseball coach Reggie Jackson, personal trainer Claudia Schiffer, a huge mansion, limos, helicopter. But still, there wassomething missing. Something money couldn't buy friends.          Richie's parents, Richard and Regina Rich, were always away on business and Richie's schoolmates were too busy to hang around with him. Richie's only companion was his faithful butler, Herbert Cadbury. One day, Richard and Regina were going to fly to England for the Queen's birthday. What they didn't know was that one of their crooked employees Lawrence VanDough and his twisted sidekick Mr. Ferguson, had planted a bomb aboard the plane.           Meanwhile, Richie had made friends with a group of kids who were playing baseball in a field. They're invited over to Richie's house and are in awe when they see what he has his own personal McDonald's, roller coaster, Kid-apult, and more! Richie get's the news about his parents. They didn't die, instead they were drifting at sea on a life raft; Richie decided to take full control, against Mr.VanDough. Everything was going great until VanDough framed Cadbury for the murder of Mr. and Mrs. Rich so he was taken to jail.VanDough then resumed full control. With the help of the brilliant Professor Keenbean, Richie get's Cadbury out of jail, and together, with the help of his new friends, stop VanDough and rescue Richie's parents when VanDoiugh finds them and holds them hostage.        Pretty good movie. One of Macaulay Culkin's last. We all remember how he got his big start in Home Alone. Actually, he started before that in Uncle Buck. Jonathan Hyde is Herbert Cadbury, Richie's gentleman's gentleman. John Larroquette is Larry VanDough, fresh off the John Larroquette Show, or before he did it. Anyway, a very good family film! I recommend it!-- "},{"Title":"Fair Family Fare. Not What I Would Call Rich Though.","Date":"10 October 2003","Score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  Fair little production has Macaulay Culkin starring as the titled character, the popular comic book hero for the youngest of age groups. Culkin has everything, but lacks companionship from other children. When Culkin's very wealthy parents (Edward Herrmann and Christine Ebersole) are kidnapped by evil company businessman John Larroquette, it is up to Culkin, his butler (Jonathan Hyde of Titanic fame) and some inner-city youngsters he has befriended to save the day and hold on to the family's estate. Richie Rich is for younger audiences and will keep most in that group entertained and interested. However, this is far from cinematic excellence. The story is second-rate and nothing really becomes too interesting as the film advances. Average overall. 2.5 out of 5 stars.

The whole thing about the cabal trying to seize his money was merely an excuse for what was basically a glorification of money. I think that there's a reason that Macaulay Culkin disappeared after this movie (although that was already coming). There are some clever lines - namely the Michael Jackson comment - but there are plenty of good movies out there, so there's NO REASON to waste your time on this. Also starring John Larroquette, Edward Herrmann, Christine Ebersole and Jonathan Hyde; they probably don't wish to include this on their resumes.

Gosh, I think I'm going to give 'Richie Rich' a 8/10. That's 1 point for the movie and 7 points for Jonathan Hyde ( Cadbury ) who was the only one I actually enjoyed. A good advice for you movie-addicts and normal people out there please find Home Alone (2) or pop in Jumanji once more so that ( if you saw Richie Rich, of course ) you can forget this horrible experience!!!

I don't really know.","Date":"2 April 2003","Score":"0 out of 6 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Family","Review":"  Richie RichHis personal trainer is Claudia Claudia Schiffer. His sports coach is Reggie Jackson. His backyard contains a rollercoaster, a kid-a-pault and enough room for about three thousand kids much less one. His name? Richie Rich. Based on the famous Harvey comic strip comes a film about friendship, love, loyalty, and a last mainstream acting job for Macaulay Culkin.Culkin plays Richie Rich, who seems to have it all money. His father is a billionaire. Because of this, he can have just about anything. He even has a McDonald's in his mansion. But he yearns for friends every day. Soon he starts to become friends with a group of sandlot baseball players. But things go downhill when the evil John Laroquette tries to kill off Richie's family on a plane. Little does he know Richie wasn't on the plane--and even further does he not know that Richie's parents are still alive at sea, waiting to be picked up by a plane.Richie Rich is, in a way, horrible. Everything is very cartoony, stupid, and stereotypical (check out the sandlot group and the mother from New York's accent--woof!). But even further is how god-awful of an actor Macaulay Culkin is. However, Richie Rich has a strange attraction to it that is truly unplaceable. It's a bit like a Lewis Carroll story. Everything is so strange and different, and intriguing. Some things are unexplainably stupid. Take this for instance Richie's parents are out at sea on a raft, floating about helplessly. Back at home, Richie has become the head of his dad's business. We see the front of famous newspapers with his face one them, saying Whiz kid learns the biz! and etc. Now, as we all know, to publish a magazine centered around a business person can take quite a while. They don't print straight away--it takes a while to actually print the magazine. And we are shown at least TEN magazine covers. Now, this could be a matter of months--we are shown Richie dealing business, etc...hiring new members for the business...this could take a while, all right...but then we cut back to Richie's parents, STILL ALIVE on the raft. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the average human cannot go for more than a few days without drinking, right? Well, Richie's parents are still alive and well, talking about hosting dinner parties. Things like those are unexplainable. Still, little things aren't biggies.The world of Richie Rich is strangely attractive. I don't quite know why I enjoy it. It's like those awful movies on TV, that you really despise, yet at the same time find yourself watching every time they come on. So many things in Richie Rich are corny, stupid, and so very predictable. The ending is ludicrous, and the whole thing with Richie's friends from the sandlot helping him out is awful.So why, oh why do I like this movie? I don't really know.

Lame jokes and flagrant waste of character actors like Herrmann and McShane who get through the material without completely scarring their careers. Culkin is much to blame for the film's downfall...he's simply lost the touch and it shows.  "}]
