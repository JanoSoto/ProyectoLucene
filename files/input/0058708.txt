Because they had known the old girl herself (the real Mrs. Margaret Brown, that is) back in the early years of the century, both in Leadville and Denver, they were keen on seeing what Hollywood and Debbie had done with the story.I remember vividly watching their reactions turn from initial pleasure with the opening number to puzzlement when Debbie started to chew the scenery and behave like, well, Debbie Reynolds.  This was followed by Ed Begley and the boys in the saloon hooting it up, and the two old ladies next to me started to frown a bit and whisper something to the effect that it was not like that at all.  They were becoming quite restless until the Denver bits began, but they seemed to accept the remainder of the story with a good deal of resignation that it was all just good fun and nonsense, and wasn't that what going to the movies was all about?Afterward, as we strolled over to the Brown Palace for dinner, they regaled me with a complete history of the real Mrs. Brown and the many mutual friends they had enjoyed meeting at that same venue from roughly 1895 to 1915 when they were themselves just being presented into Denver society. I learned, among other things, that Mrs. Brown was considered an eccentric but generally well-liked and articulate woman who, despite never really being accepted at the toniest levels, became a legend in her own time after the Titanic episode.  That part of the story was not only true, but actually a larger-than-life experience, the details of which they agreed should have been featured more profoundly in the film version. The next time I drove down Wadsworth Blvd. and saw Mrs. Brown's Summer House, a rather grand Victorian edifice like the better known one in the center of Denver, I tried to picture Debbie Reynolds in that setting and could not quite fit the two together.  That in spite of the fact that Debbie herself grew up in El Paso at the southern end of the same Rocky Mountains that rise northward through Colorado.

Inever put Debbie Reynolds in the same class as her bigger contemporaries-- Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Doris Day, etc.  Reynolds always managedto charm me, even in tough roles like THE RAT RACE.  She's wonderful inSINGIN' IN THE RAIN, but that's more supporting.  In the 50s, she appeared in  lots of fluffy movies such as TAMMY AND THE BACHELOR and as the decadeended, she was a popular leading lady entering a decade that wouldn't be kind  to the well-established studio stars.  Molly Brown was a role to show that she  could do it all--act, sing, dance, and demonstrate her remarkable energy.  I fell  in love the movie from the first frame and it's been one of my very favorites ever  since.  I own the DVD (after replacing my VHS edition).  The choreography byPeter Gennaro won't set any new standards, but it's athletic and exciting,nowhere better than in the big party scene where Molly is showing off theEuropean royalty to Denver society.  You can't help but get caught up in thesheer joyousness of what's happening on screen.  Harve Presnell is a handsome presence as Molly's husband, Johnny Brown. His handsome baritone is a pleasure to hear.  The rest of the cast is excellent,  and would be one of the last and one of the most lavish of  MGM's big studiomusicals.I've seen the film innumerable times.  If you don't like musicals, MOLLY BROWN  won't change your mind.  But if you do, this lively story of a dirt-poor country girl  who marries a miner and gets filthy rich and becomes famous for her heroicshelping survivors of the TITANIC, is pure delight.

Debbie Reynolds does a wonderful job portraying Molly Brown, a poor, uncultured country girl who makes good, but then finds herself having to fight (none too successfully) for acceptance among the rich crowd she finds herself suddenly thrown into. Always rising when she's down (unsinkable in other words) there's also a sense of discovery involved for Molly, as she finally comes to understand in a wonderfully dramatic moment in an otherwise hilarious film that even among her wealthy and regal European friends she is accepted because they find her amusing, and not because she's really accepted as one of them. The title of the movie, of course, comes specifically from the real-life Molly Brown's experience in surviving the Titanic disaster, as she returns home after making this discovery.Yes, the movie is undoubtedly full of tall tales. But it's full of wonderful songs (Harve Presnell as Johnny Brown has a marvellous singing voice), pretty good acting and just a general sense of fun. Well worth the watching.

It's a film role perfectly suited to Debbie Reynolds both musically and dramatically.The Meredith Willson musical ran for 532 performances on Broadway and starred Tammy Grimes there. In the Hollywood tradition though, a movie name was thought to be needed. 1964 was a bad year for Broadway actresses who originated roles and did not get the film role. Julie Andrews also knew exactly how Tammy Grimes felt.The one big difference is that no one had to dub Debbie Reynolds. Her singing and dancing is all a part of one remarkable role where the character ages and matures and there's a big difference in those two life functions. I'm of the firm belief that MGM cast her in this part because of her musical numbers in How the West Was Won which they also produced. Debbie may also still have been under contract to them from the old days.Harve Presnell came over from Broadway to play her husband John J. Brown of Leadville, Colorado and who makes them both rich beyond their wildest dreams. But Molly's dreams are larger than John's and it causes their parting. Presnell has a terrific baritone voice and he unfortunately came along at the tail end of movie musicals. His next film was Paint Your Wagon and he got to sing They Call the Wind Maria which requires a real singer to do, not something Lee Marvin or Clint Eastwood could fake. Presnell's developed into a fine character actor though.Years ago I happened to meet Ed Begley's widow at an event. She mentioned to me that her husband for all the great dramatic parts he played including winning an Oscar for Sweet Bird of Youth was at heart a song and dance man. He loved to get up and perform at parties and such. I said to her that the role of Debbie Reynolds's father in The Unsinkable Molly Brown must have been one he loved and she said it was his favorite. Begley certainly looks like he's having a great old time in the part.Meredith Willson's score, while not as good as The Music Man still has some fine numbers. Debbie's infectious singing of I Ain't Down Yet is the high point. For Presnell his anthem to Colorado My Home if it isn't, it should be that state's official song. The only criticism I have of the film is that as good as Molly Brown is here there was so much more to the woman that The Unsinkable Molly Brown doesn't even get into. She was a suffragette, a leader in reform of juvenile offender laws, a noted philanthropist, she wasn't just a party girl who got a chance for heroism on the Titanic. I wish that had been dealt with in the film and the Broadway musical.For a rollicking good musical experience though, you cannot beat The Unsinkable Molly Brown. No putting this woman or this film down, ever.

We see the same desire for upward mobility as a George Eastman in A Place in the Sun. Naturally, for Reynolds, this desire is framed around this excellent musical.As she grows up, she meets her husband-to-be, an engaging Harve Presnell, whose great voice, as in his rendition I'll Never Say No Again is great. After they marry, Molly's accidental burning of the money she was hiding for safe-keeping is hilarious. In his anger, Johnny (Presnell) strikes gold purely by accident. This supposedly will lift the newlyweds to a new life filled with wealth.Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Uneducated and lacking polish, they are immediately rejected by Denver's socialite families. When they throw their own party, no one shows up with the exception of the faithful, kindly pastor.Her inability to move up socially will ultimately cause a separation from Johnny. Molly and her husband head off to Europe to become a cultured. They achieve this as she mingles with the elite of European society. Johnny wants to go home and when Molly refuses, the two part.Regarded well by her new friends, Molly decides to come home as her heart longs for John. History was apparently on Molly's side. She was on the Titanic and was credited for calming the hysterical women survivors during this disaster. Coming home, she is heralded by Denver's elite-including neighbor and arch enemy, Audrey Christie. (Remember her as Natalie Wood's mother in Splendor in the Grass?) Naturally, Mrs. McGraw's (Christie) mother is Buttercup, a wonderful common Hermione Baddeley, who has become a good friend to the man who reared Molly- Ed Begley, in a gem of a performance with his full Irish brogue.The singing and dancing are great. The musical scene where the elite of Europe dance with the people of Denver is hilarious.A great film with a marvelous ensemble cast. A wonderful realization of social mobility in America. Did it really have to take the heroic efforts of Molly to establish herself among the elite of Denver?

I frankly found that aspect of her personality bothersome, yet she did grow in maturity, as the picture wore on.   Debbie Reynolds does a good job with the lead, although I personally would have preferred Tammy Grimes, from the Broadway debut of this musical. Harve Presnell is great as Johnny, and that voice is awesome. Ed Begley absolutely steals the show, as Shamus Tobin.    The spirited musical numbers are quite fun to watch, with He's My Friend being a standout. The film does seem to go on too long somewhat, as towards the end it was starting to drag.

Tammy Grimes, as the Molly Brown of the title, received, perhaps, the best reviews of her acting career. When it was made into an MGM musical, Miss Grimes, lost her creation to Debbie Reynolds, who had a bigger name and was a favorite of the movie going public.Meredith Wilson, the man behind another hit, The Music Man, created a musical comedy that showcased a fictionalized account of the larger than life character of Molly, a woman who went from humble beginnings to bigger, and better things. As a matter of fact, she was truly unsinkable as proved by having survived the Titanic disaster.Not having seen this film for quite some time, didn't quite make it for this viewer, on a second viewing, in spite of glowing comments from other IMDb contributors. However, it must be noted, our memory of having seen it before was more positive than the impression we got in watching it again. Part of the problem is the plot, which is silly, in the way the material is presented. Then again, this film has a dated feeling.Debbie Reynolds threw herself into the role of Molly with gusto. It's one of her best achievements in the movies, and it should be recognized. Herve Presnell, who played Johnny Brown on Broadway, seemed destined for bigger and better things, as he shows here with his handsome looks and powerful singing voice. The cast includes several character actors that enhance the movie, notably, Ed Begley, Hermione Baddeley, Jack Krushen and Martita Hunt, among others.The film could be seen as a curiosity, although it shows its age. The songs, with only a few exceptions don't have the quality of other Meredith Wilson's work. Only a couple of songs stay with the viewer after all is said and done. Charles Walters' direction was not too inspired and perhaps that seems to be the basic flaw with this Molly.

Flashback some 30 years to the mid 1960's when Reynolds got the chance to play another leading role in a Meredith Willson show, and a real-life woman of legend. It has been 100 years since the Titanic sank and the real life Molly Brown assisted panicky passengers on the lifeboats. While the stories vary to her involvement, the legend has not died. The 1960 Broadway show was a critically mixed musical that had a respectful run. After The Music Man was a smash movie, MGM set their sights on Molly Brown, and cast their peppiest star of the 1950's in the role for which she is now most famous for. The result An Oscar Nominated performance that many viewers claim the prize should have been hers.Baby Molly is first seen floating down the Colorado River, having survived a flood, and when next seen, she is a rambunctious teenager boasting I Ain't Down Yet! to her bullying cousins who tease her about her desire to leave their mountain home for the beautiful people of Denver. Leaving her loving grandfather (Ed Begley Sr.), Reynolds briefly works in a saloon, but her efforts to get to Denver are delayed when she falls in love with and marries Johnny Brown (Harve Presnell), a miner searching for gold. When they strike it rich, Molly and Johnny end up in Denver, but find that society, lead by the snooty Mrs. McGraw (stage veteran Audrey Christie) isn't going to cater to riffraff like her, no matter how many millions they are worth. So to show the stuffy society up, they go off to Europe and bag themselves a royal flush, come back, throw an outrageous party, then fight, separate, and long for each other in spite of their problems. It is when Molly returns home that she finds herself aboard the Titanic, grabbing herself a piece of history and proving herself truly unsinkable.This is a movie musical that works better on screen than on stage with its colorful Colorado mountain setting. I saw Reynolds and Presnell in a touring production of the show in 1988 and noticed a difference between the two, mostly based upon a book that while entertaining needed much tweaking. Reynolds and Presnell are supported by a wonderful supporting cast which also includes Hermoine Baddley as Mrs. McGraw's brassy mother who puts her daughter down a peg or two, and the delightfully imperious Martita Hunt (Great Expectation's Miss Haversham) as the Duchess who also adds her two cents to Mrs. McGraw for previously snubbing Molly. Do you play, Mrs. McGraw?, she asks her after Molly promises to entertain them on the piano, obviously having set this up. No, sorry. Pity, she replies dryly as if dismissing a naughty servant.But this is Reynolds' show, and I personally feel that she deserved the Oscar this year. No other performer (maybe Judy Garland) could make you laugh and cry, yet sing, dance, be funny and serious, like Debbie Reynolds. She is outrageous in the dancing sequences, whether bellying up to the bar, or doing the high kicks of He's My Friend, a wonderful new production added for the movie. Fortunately, she got to do this as well in the touring production, as well as sing the songs cut from the movie. (My Own Brass Bed is particularly memorable, but didn't make it into the film.) Presnell is a handsome leading man with a wonderful singing voice, but when I saw this on the big screen, I found his tendency to cross his eyes a bit distracting. This probably cut his leading man career down, but as a character actor (most memorably the father-in-law in Fargo) he would find roles more suitable. Reynolds and Presnell have a wonderful duet, I'll Never Say No, and Presnell has several fine solos as well, showing off his manly physique while building a home for Molly.Rumors have had Molly Brown as a possible contender for a Broadway revival with a tweaked book. I hope this is true, because Willson's songs, the magnificent choreography and the tale of a feisty heroine are the stuff that legends are made of.

In other words, if you want a true account of the life of Molly Brown, you might want to look elsewhere.The film begins with Molly as a child. She is washed away by a flood, but being unsinkable, she manages to pull herself to safety. The story is set in Colorado, where she grew up a rough and tumble tom-boy. However, despite being VERY unladylike, she had a dream of one day living in a fine house, with a brass bed, a warm fireplace and all the niceties money can buy. When Mr. Brown falls for her, the rather mercenary Molly insists she won't marry any man who can't provide her with all these things....and he does. Soon (and only in a Hollywood film can it be THIS soon), Mr. Brown is very, very, very rich and his wife has many, many things....but she is still unhappy because she doesn't fit in with society. So, she sets off very determined to go off to Europe to refine herself and make friends with royalty. Well, she does....but somehow in the process she ends up losing what is really important--though in real life, no such realization and reconciliation ever actually occurred.The film is VERY bouncy and, at times, quite fun. Debbie Reynolds throws herself into the role and it's one of her best. As for poor Mr. Brown, Harve Presnell was GREAT. He really, really sang beautifully and it's sad he never really became a household name. And, the film is pretty good. However, there was one weakness that prevented the movie from being any better--the leading character was unbelievably selfish and hard to like--especially as the film progressed.

The Unsinkable Molly Brown is a movie that I've loved ever since my Mom dragged the whole family to see in 1964 when it came out. My reaction after reading a lot of these reviews is that most of the naysayers should lighten up. It is a musical COMEDY film made right at the end of the studio era in Hollywood. In comedy performers are quite broad. This wasn't a film that was supposed to be sophisticated...remember that one of the biggest TV hits of the time was The Beverly Hillbillies. In my opinion Debbie Reynolds should have taken home the Oscar for Best Actress as she nails the part in all 3 aspects--singing, dancing, and acting. If you disagree with me about the acting, just re-watch the scene in Europe when she encounters Gladys MacGraw in the fancy restaurant while she's missing Johnny. Julie was wonderful too, but her character of Mary Poppins was rather a one-note one. She won simply because she was denied the role of Eliza Dolittle by Jack Warner, and she was much, much better that year in The Americanization of Emily and in 1965 in The Sound of Music. The Unsinkable Molly Brown is one of the last of the old-style Hollywood musicals and rates as the 7th best film of 1964 on my 10 Best List for that year.

The leading role was passed from Shirley MacLaine to Debbie Reynolds, who were box office stars in 1964 (positioned at #7 and #12 in the Quigley Publications annual poll that year). Grimes won a Tony for her performance, and Reynolds was considered for a Best Actress award. She is certainly energetic, but this performance is overrated. Reynolds yells rather than sings her songs, and Mr. Willson's soundtrack is strikingly inferior to The Music Man. And the story is superficial...Don't expect much from the Titanic connection.

This movie, with Debbie Reynolds starring as Molly Brown and Harve Presnell as John J.

This movie version of Molly Brown's story received 6 Oscar nominations, and was adapted from the very successful stage production. I like this tiny Texan, Debbie Reynolds. She was so good in 'Singing In The Rain' a decade earlier with Gene Kelly, and here you can see how well the dancing instruction from Kelly paid off in her subsequent roles. She brings the appropriate Molly Brown spunk to the role, but is probably quite a bit more attractive than the real Molly Brown, whose home I visted while in Denver back about 25 years ago. It is fun to make all those historical connections.I'm even a bigger fan of Presnell's. To me it shows how much it is worth to be in the right place at the right time.' Presnell wasn't. He was a bit late for most of the big musicals, and as a result his wonderful trained baritone voice has gone mostly under-appreciated. I saw him on stage in Houston about 15 or 16 years ago, and to me was the star of the production. Now, in his later years he has had good dramatic roles (notably in 'Fargo' as Macy's rich father in law), but he is an example of a very talented, and handsome, singer and actor who could have done so much more, had he been in the right place at the right time.

Debbie Reynolds was right. (Shirley MacLaine years later would play Debbie in Postcards From The Edge, perhaps a bit of payback?) I recommend this colorful and great musical from the greatest studio of its time MGM.

But this is a movie musical. It's loosely based on the life and fortunes (pun intended) of a real person. But the details of that life are turned to fiction to fit the romance, comedy and music and dance of a musical. And what a great piece of entertainment it is. The Unsinkable Molly Brown is a first-rate film with great music and dance numbers, and with a good plot to boot. It has a good serving of comedy, a tender love story, and lessons about life. The sets and costumes are spectacular and the film has some great Rocky Mountain scenery. The movie was a box office success, and the fact that it received six Academy Award nominations says something about its quality &#x96; including the best actress nomination for Reynolds. Just consider the competition it was up against. Film historians say that musicals were waning in appeal by the mid-1960s. Yet, 1964 was one of the most competitive years in the history of Hollywood for musicals. Besides Molly Brown, Mary Poppins scored a best actress for Julie Andrews, and My Fair Lady took the best picture prize. Indeed, 1964 was a great year for movies period, so the Academy Awards for that year was a showcase of great movies that have endured with time. Other great films were Becket, Zorba the Greek, Dr Strangelove, The Night of the Iguana, Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte, The Pink Panther, Seven Days in May, What a Way to Go, The Best Man, and The Fall of the Roman Empire. As one who greatly enjoys musicals for the many song and dance talents of show biz, including group songs and dance routines, I find it hard to rate one top performance over another. Especially in a year when three great musicals came out. Mary Poppins surely had the most popular tunes, including the incomparable Julie Andrews singing Chim Chim Cher-ee. My Fair Lady had the unique Rain in Spain series with Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, and two good choreographed scenes. But I liked the boisterous numbers Debbie Reynolds had in Molly Brown, the very good songs that baritone Harve Presnell sang, and the two large-scale group song and dance episodes. Then, I like the story line of Molly Brown best &#x96; even fictionalized &#x96; because it's about a real person, who lived a most unusual life, with times and places I knew about and could recognize as a viewer. So, I give The Unsinkable Molly Brown a rating of 9 out of 10 stars &#x96; the same as for Mary Poppins; and just one-notch away from the 10 rating I give to My Fair Lady. (My only other 10 ratings for the year were Becket and Dr. Strangelove, and the only other 9 ratings I gave were for Zorba the Greek and The Pink Panther. And, very few years dating since the 1920s do I have six films that I rate 9 or 10.)

The scene of Reynolds barking out orders at the other women on the Titanic lifeboat feels like an SNL skit. The film is a corny piece of Americana that's more busy than entertaining. Harve Persnell has a powerful voice, but is largely wooden and adrift, and he and Reynolds are not well-matched. The scenes depicting the sinking of the Titanic and its aftermath are rushed, and the ending is anti-climatic. Like many movie musicals, it has a few decent musical numbers, I particularly liked He's My Friend, but little else is memorable. Molly Brown's story is so much more interesting than what is presented here.

Whether it's her youthful zeal in Singin' in the Rain, her over-the-top turn as Grace's ditzy diva mother Bobbi on Will & Grace, or her daughter Carrie's vituperative portrayal of her (and Shirley MacLaine's tough-minded interpretation) in the roman-à-clef, Postcards from the Edge, Reynolds keeps on ticking with her enduring, all-American brand of foot-stomping peppiness. Based on the 1960 Broadway hit, this overlong 1964 musical is arguably her career highpoint since it's a true star vehicle and one of the last of MGM's big musicals that yielded a profit. The 2000 DVD does the film justice with a nice print that captures the vibrancy of the colors and the bombast of the musical arrangements. However, despite a musical score from Meredith Wilson (The Music Man), the problem remains that it's just not a very memorable entertainment. It certainly isn't for lack of Reynolds' all-cylinders-on approach.Directed by Charles Walters and written by Helen Deutsch, the story is a fictionalized biopic of the legendary Molly Brown, an ill-mannered, illiterate backwoods girl intent on leaving her small town of Leadville to marry rich. She meets John Brown, who for no obvious reason is smitten with her, as he teaches her to read and she entertains the miners at the local tavern. They marry, strike it rich in silver and gold mines, and move to fashionable Pennsylvania Avenue in Denver. Shunned by the social register, they go to Europe where Molly is so embraced by royalty that she brings them back to Denver. The Browns hold a big society party which turns into a brawl, and they separate. Coming back from another European trip, Molly becomes a survivor of the Titanic as she keeps the spirits of her fellow passengers up as they await rescue. Yes, this is the same Molly Brown that Kathy Bates portrays in the 1997 mega-hit.Fresh off The Music Man, Wilson has written a score that doesn't feature anything close to the gems of his previous hit with Belly Up the Bar, Boys! the only one with enough rowdy energy to be considered rousing. In a role ironically slated for MacLaine, Reynolds is rambunctious and performs with exhausting brio, but there's no getting around the fact that Molly is a superficially driven character. I also find it amusing how contemporary she looks in her final scenes. Translating his Broadway role, Harve Presnell evokes Howard Keel's baritone and barrel-chested virility as her husband. With the decline of musicals, he didn't really find success in movies until he played the doomed father-in-law in Fargo over three decades later. Titanic aficionados will be disappointed that this part of the story is given short shrift toward the end with recycled footage from 1958's A Night to Remember. The DVD has the original theatrical trailer and a silly vintage short about the making of one of Reynolds' gowns. Only for fans of movie musicals.

Her acting is too broad, loud and abrasive. It boggles the mind that she was nominated for an Oscar here. I understand that Debbie's a very energetic performer, but unfortunately she went waaaay over-the-top in The Unsinkable Molly Brown, playing a screeching hillbilly whose vocal and physical contortions had me cringing in disbelief. Maybe her acting is extreme so that we'll be more impressed by Debbie's transformation into a refined lady later - but I found the characterization cartoonish.Apart from that...I have a problem with pretty much everything else about the movie! Debbie's leading man is unappealing, the songs are unmemorable, the humour is unsubtle (and unfunny), the plot is unfaithful to the true story of the *real* Molly Brown, and the apparent moral is hard to swallow. I'm supposed to root for Molly and her ambitions for wealth and social status? I'm supposed to be angry at her husband for not supporting her shallow aim in life? For loving her the way she was when they met (miraculously!) and not wanting her, or their life, to change? I guess a lot of people wouldn't have a problem with this film's message, because they too are pursuing the American Dream and envying the idle rich. But I don't care to watch folks with superficial values and greedy goals in life, desperately try to climb social ladders. Those who see movies such as My Fair Lady primarily as Cinderella stories, where the main objective is to ooh and aah over rags-to-riches transformations and gaze at the heroine's fancy clothes/rich lifestyle... might enjoy The Unsinkable Molly Brown. But I'd kinda like to see her sink like a stone.

The rest was just... there, not horrible, but definitly not above average, either.Debbie Reynolds should have been very well suited to the role of Molly Brown, but for all her teeth-gritting, yelling, and wailing, she just doesn't rise to the occasion.  Why this is often considered her best role, and why she was nominated for an Oscar for it, I really couldn't tell you.  Harve Presnell has a soaring voice, but again, just is average.  The Merideth Willson score is rather pedestrian.  (Apparently several songs were cut from the Broadway show; maybe they were better.)  But really, this guy did The Music Man?  And the Titanic sinking is done and dispensed with in maybe two minutes, if that.  Come on!  The one reason this musical was made was because of Mrs. Brown's legendary courage after that sinking.  Not much evidence of that here.  Oh, and yes, the musical is pretty accurate in terms of the many legends surrouding Margaret Brown, but not so faithful to the real person.  (Many minute things she was never rescued from a flood as a baby, she was actually born and raised in Hannibal, Missouri, her husband was always called J.J., never Johnny, they never really did reconcile, she actually had two children with him that were not mentioned, she never really was accepted by the Sacred Thirty-Six, her many contributions to the juvenile and suffrage movements were ignored as always, etc. and so forth.  She was never even called Molly, always Margaret.)  You get the point...It simply wasn't anything special.

(Harve Presnell) in the form of a musical.  This review is being written by someone who can't stand most musicals, keep in mind, except for a few classics (i.e. Fiddler on the Roof, Grease).  The songs in those two said movies were quite enjoyable, but the songs in Molly Brown are all about thirty seconds long and ten minutes apart, and consist of Reynolds singing along with Presnell.  It's quite disturbing really, when the woman has a more masculine voice than the man.The only remotely likable performance in this movie is by Reynolds, but that's only because all of the other characters either whine about being poor or whine about being bugged by the poor.  Oh, Presnell's character whines about being rich too.  You're left with one question after viewing this movie What the hell was everyone's problem?  Each character whines about something.  Some songs are even devoted to whining.  It gets very annoying.And another thing Molly Brown got her nickname because she survived the Titanic.  Unfortunately, this movie spends all of one minute on this fact.  The title would have more relevance if it were The Rich Molly Brown or The Classy Molly Brown or even Whining Songs and Husky Voices.In the end, The Unsinkable Molly Brown disappoints in almost every  way, 6/10.

Reynolds, especially at the beginning, has the habit of screeching her songs and using awkward movements as her dancing steps. She also seems to enjoy screaming out randomly; I guess she thinks this is how people raised in the mountains act. I have fun remembering every scene and laughing at how awful it is (e.g. John's crying scene is he supposed to be crying or is he contorting his face?). While Molly grows more refined, John becomes more unbearable, and also more and more resembles a fish. This movie is over the top, and not in a good way.

Perhaps all genres go through a life cycle and eventually fade away, or so most observers believe. But I think there was a more fundamental shift at work, a shift in how we see film stories. Musicals demand that we enter a work that wavers between reality (in the story) and a stylized non-reality where a song-and-dance theatrical entertainment is presented. Since the 60s, we've been unwilling to shift realities without one of the explicit conventions that have evolved, some quite sophisticated.They tried something like one of these conventions by having an onstage band whenever Christmas and gang appeared.But there are other interesting things about this project. First, that it really is rooted in reality, more so than others of its ilk. At least Molly Brown did live, and her life was roughly as depicted. Second, there was another fold with reality a celebrity scandal involving the good Debbie and the bad Liz, with Debbie fighting back (as a pudgy 32 year old).But there's another level that is lost today. The 60's in particular and the decades before as well were periods when the American social conscience was in a populist camp. Movies and books reflected this the rich were either evil, or selfish, or blind or simply stupid while the real wisdom and joy and meaning of America was found in its ordinary people.Many were the dramas that reduced things as they are here genuine but rough, simple people contrasted with the stodgy, sober unimaginative rich. That was before the American scene shifted. Most people now consider themselves middle class and don't mind being a bit pretentious consumption-wise. What was simple and genuine has been co-opted by their commercial abstractions in various worlds (country and hiphop for example).The model for Molly has now shifted to the explicitly dumb but well-intentioned and pure- hearted as in Legally Blond.Once again, we have a Technicolor redheaded heroine. She's no Charisse and danced with a loping wide athletic stance that Gene Kelly would famously criticize. Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3 You can find something better to do with this part of your life.

I certainly can't blame Debbie for wanting the part (many a musical actress of the time, including me, who hadn't a chance, lusted for it). Tammy, I suppose, was not well enough known. Pity. Harve Presnell was kept, but dieted (no doubt at the direction of the studio) from a hefty hunky miner to a boyish way-too-slender and soft leading man. With his loss of weight, the power of his Baritone voice diminished. Left as he was, he might have become a big movie star. Again, it's a pity. For those of you who have not seen it on stage with all the songs intact, by all means see the film; there is a lot in there that is worthy. Then go out and buy the Original Broadway Cast album.

I remember seeing it in 1964 and felt even as a 10 year old that they skimped on that scene because it was SO short. Well 40 years later now I realise why. Yes I agree with someone who said it would have been great casting to have seen Reynolds as Molly again in the James Cameron TITANIC given her role here. Yet another obvious disappointment and another missed opportunity. MOLLY BROWN is a lot of fun, my only reservations being Harve Presnell bellowing about Colorado and that infuriating crap footage.
