[{"Title":"Revenge of the 80'sThe reinvention of Rodney Dangerfield continues..","Date":"25 January 2005","Score":"34 out of 36 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sport","Review":" Back to School (1986) was a surprise hit for stand up comedian actor Rodeny Dangerfield. After making a big impression with audiences with his spot in the golf comedy Caddyshack and a lead role in Easy Money, his star was slowly rising. But it was this film that cemented his spot in American pop culture as a true icon of the 80's and a transition star.Rodney stars as Thorton Melon (nee Meloni) a successful entrepreneur who had to drop out of school when he was younger to take care of the family business. Years later his son is in college but feel dissatisfied with life in general. After a series of comical events, Mr. Melon decides to visit his son's exclusive university to see how he's really doing. Along the way he decides to give book learning a try.A very enjoyable film. Rodney Dangerfield made the transaction from a stand-up act to an actor. The director wisely let him improvise his dialog and work in some of his material into the movie. The cast features Sally Kellerman, Robert Downey Jr., Keith Gordon, Burt Young, Terry Farrell and guest star slots for Adrienne Barbeau and Ned Beatty.Not a masterpiece by any means but an enjoyable film none the less. Recommended, especially on a slow Sunday afternoon.

If you do something wrong they make you do it again are what carry this movie. There's not a lot of them but when they do pop-up they're hilarious.I do believe the director and producers made a mistake not taking Jim Carrey on for the role of the History Teacher because he was too young, because it wasn't a believable kind of movie any way. I must say though that the man who did play the History Teacher did a great job and seeing him teaching was one of the best parts of the movie.So if your into comedies or a Rodney fan don't be put off by how old this movie is like I was because its age, if anything, makes the movie even better.

Harold Ramis is genius in working in a lot of Dangerfield quips into the script. The movie flows well, and the supporting cast is appropriate & stronger than any of Rodney's other films.Sally Kellerman is in her best form since M*A*S*H as the English Professor who is Rodney's love interest. Robert Downey Jr. is cast perfectly as a character who resembles him in real life - a drugged out pacifist who protests campus life & all about it without knowing what message he is really sending. The actors who play straight men for Rodney from Dean Martin to the Business Professor are perfectly cast. The late Sam Kinneson is perfect in his small role in this as the History Professor. Wish he could have done more work like this. If there any extra scenes of him cut in this film, it would be great if they could be restored.Harold Ramis, who also did work ranging from GHOSTBUSTERS (trendy) to GROUND HOG DAY (classic), touches show in the script. He works Rodney's character in perfect & the plot shows some of the imagination that makes Bill Murrays classic comedy so great. He allows Rodney to be himself, but frames his character so well that he is a perfect a fit as the clothing store Mellon runs.Special kudos to Mellon's son, as he plays straight very well to his dad. Weakest of the cast is the girlfriend, but she is not given quite enough script to work with here so she makes do with what she has. At least she does OK with it. All the characters show a lot of class & this film is a fine comedy from start to finish.

Back to School came out in 1986 -a year after I graduated from Tufts University- and it nearly perfectly encapsulates (if slightly exaggerates) and skewers college life during the heedlessly hedonistic and materialistic '80s.At first Thorton Melon (Rodney's character in the movie) seemingly has two altruistic motives for applying to college 1) personal improvement, and 2) desire to help his only son Jason (Kevin Gordon) succeed, especially when Thorton discovers that Jason is not exactly the epitome of the BMOC. However, once he essentially bribes his way into college by convincing the venally avaricious Dean Martin (he, he) to let him endow the Thorton Melon school of Business Administration, high school dropout Thorton apparently has it made. One might argue that this scenario is implausible, but given universities' rapacity for more cash, I could believe they would bend the rules to let wealthy Thorton in.Thorton then proceeds to embody every college student's wet dream - to be the perpetually fun-loving slacker who has the dough to show himself and others an endless good time and buy himself out of any trouble! Again, philistine critics may argue that no college would tolerate Thorton's party-boy person; wouldn't the cops arrest him for the voyeuristic dormitory scene or the out-of-control party scene, instead of reprimanding him or bringing Lite beer (remember Rodney was one of the shills for Lite)? However, Back to School's college satire necessarily must employ a little hyperbole to get its point across.For example, in the classroom scenes with the history professor (the late Sam Kinison) and the business instructor (Paxton Whitehead), the movie does also go a little over the top but also tweaks college for its well-meaning but unrealistically theoretical approach (i.e. head up its a$$ approach) to working and life. Yeah, especially Thornton's take on the corruption and shady dealing it would really take to start a business really do have a germ of truth. Also, the way Thorton prepares for his classes -his secretary takes notes for him in class and his research team does his reports and homework- is off the wall but also possesses scientific veracity. I'm sure at Tufts and other colleges, some students never went to class and got others to take notes and do reports. However, (and this is one of my favorite scenes from the movie) only Thornton would heft a report created by his research team and crack, I dunno; it feels like a C; add some more multicolored graphs. And of course only Thornton would hire Kurt Vonnegut to appraise his own work.Nevertheless, Back to School lets Rodney collide with harsh, poignant reality without sacrificing laughs. Thornton is failing his classes; even the professor most sympathetic to him (Sally Kellerman) suspects him of plagiarism. His son Jason angrily refuses to let Thornton's think tank do his astronomy work. Thornton will be expelled unless he passes a multi-part oral exam (!) by all of his course professors. After a pep talk from Thornton's chauffeur (Burt Young) about Thornton's School of Hard Knocks life, Jason realizes that just as his dad came to school to show him how to loosen up and enjoy life, he must show his dad how to handle college responsibilities. And isn't that what college is all about - balancing responsibility and fun to have a meaningfully productive experience?Therefore, Back to School is more than just an Animal House retread. It uses Rodney's older, wry perspective (and those priceless one-liners) to point out both the absurdity and importance of college life. Heck, I would even recommend high school seniors applying to colleges to give Back to School a look if only to show them (with a grain of salt, of course) that while college is a worthwhile experience, it's also a unique, unfamiliar world all its own.P.S. I would advise Cedric the Entertainer to abandon his 2006 remake of Back to School as an ill-advised travesty.

In addition to Dangerfield, who is terrific as usual, we also get to see Sally Kellerman, Burt Young, Ned Beatty, and an introduction to the brilliance of Robert Downey Jr. who is unforgettable as Derek Lutz. Although the movie is silly, lacking any convincing realism or plot, it is nontheless wonderful fun...especially if you are a Dangerfield fan. His rendition of Twist and Shout is a classic. And the scene at registration where his chauffeur Lou, played by the redoubtable Young, is priceless when he holds up a sign by the limo with Bruce Springstein's name on it and all the students rush out to mob the car while Dangerfield, his son, his son's love interest, and Lutz have the pick of classes.Generally good viewing when you want a brainless, fun night.

What's next...a remake of Animal House with P-Diddy as Bluto (or whatever he calls himself these days)? Rodney is already turning over in his grave knowing how bad the remake is going to be. Somewhere up there I hope he can convince God to strike the set with thunderous bolts of lightning and 14 inch hailstones. Can't Hollywood leave well enough alone?

The movie is really an excuse for Dangerfield to be a complete goof-off, containing every silly thing imaginable. Possibly the best line is Thornton's comment about Longfellow.As for the other characters, Keith Gordon does OK as Thornton's son Jason, but Robert Downey Jr. is even neater as Jason's ultra-left-wing friend Derek, who even has a theory about the fascism of football. Sally Kellerman, Burt Young, M. Emmet Walsh, Adrienne Barbeau, Ned Beatty, Sam Kinison and Robert Picardo are all pretty good in their roles (there's even an appearance by Kurt Vonnegut). It's just that this is Rodney Dangerfield's movie all the way. I think that it's quite safe to assert that the Man Who Got No Respect will truly be missed.A hilarious movie.

He plays a crass self-made millionaire whose son is away at college. After divorcing the second wife--a shrew (Adrienne Barbeau)--he drops in on the kid (Keith Gordon) to discover the kid is not if a fraternity or on the diving team. The kid wants to drop out so Rodney decides to go BACK TO SCHOOL to encourage the kid. Great premise.Of course Rodney becomes a free-spending, beer-swilling college frosh to the delight of the student body and school administration. Rodney spews and almost unending barrage of jokes and one-liners and is hysterically funny. But beyond the crass character, this is one time when Dangerfield also shows some acting chops and some sweetness to his character. And it works! Top supporting cast helps out a lot too. Sally Kellerman is the English prof. Paxton Whitehead is the snotty business teacher. Robert Downey is the bizarro roomie. Ned Beatty plays Dean Martin. William Zabka is the obnoxious rival. Terry Farrell is the too-tall girl friend. Burt Young plays Lou the bodyguard. Edie McClurg is the secretary. Sam Kinison is the shell-shocked history prof. Severn Darden is the lab guy. M. Emmett Walsh is the diving coach. Jason Hervey is Dangerfield as a kid. And Danny Elfman appears as his Oingo Boingo self and scored the film.The diving finale is hysterically funny and the perfect ending for this sweet and funny movie.

I remember having enjoyed it when it came out fifteen years ago, but who knew it could stand beside 'Caddyshack' as a timeless comedy about the anti-establishment starring some guy in his fifties?Nowadays you could never assemble such a talented cast for such a light-weight comedy. The best thing about this film is its restraint to avoid easy, obvious jokes. The humor is simple and inoffensive and the characters are believable in this setting. Here, a college world is created that could never be, but we are sucked in because the story makes its own rules and doesn't go overboard trying to be unconventional. Even when the late Sam Kinison as a history teacher is screaming about Vietnam, we buy it because his schtick is funny, to-the-point and above all, brief. The individual jokes come so fast that even if you don't like one specific bit, it's over in the blink of an eye and another zinger is right behind it.The stock characters are all here but they are never boring or entirely predictable. The pretty teacher played by Sally Kellerman is smart and honest. Although she would probably never be attracted physically to someone like Rodney Dangerfield, we can see how she would be drawn to him because of his popularity with the other students. The stuffy business teacher (Paxton Whitehead) would also be on hand to try and keep the rowdies down, but if this were made today, he'd end up in the hospital or worse due to a college prank. The only disappointment is Keith Gordon who plays Dangerfield's son. He's not charismatic enough to play such a major role, but his love interest Terry Farrell is just as bland so they're perfect for each other. Robert Downey Jr. is perfect as the misfit rebel. Something tells me he was really like this growing up which is why he is still thumbing his nose at authority and sitting in jail or rehab as I write this. Adrienne Barbeau is, as usual, playing the busty bitch, but I've been in love with her since 'Maude.' Burt Young as Rodney's chauffeur is basically playing Pauley from 'Rocky' while wearing different funny hats (why the beret at the diving meet?). Ned Beatty and M. Emmet Walsh are also on hand to round out the school faculty with their character acting chops firmly in place (actually I always thought they were the same person).There are classic scenes that will not be forgotten. The young Rodney in 1940. The bookstore spending spree. The secretary taking notes in Rodney's absence. The last-minute studying session. The combining of three dorm rooms into one. The Kurt Vonnegut Jr. scene. I already mentioned Sam Kinison but it bears repeating. The 'Twist and Shout' song. The hot-tub party. And, of course, the Triple Lindy.All this and Danny Elfman and Harold Ramis to boot. If you haven't seen this and you're a fan of Rodney, shame on you. Go get it tonight. Right now! Go, before someone beats you to it.

There didn't seem to be any gel there.Performances Sally Kellerman (the love interest), Adrienne Barbeau (briefly as the unscrupulous wife), Burt Young (same act, no matter the role), a baby-faced Robert Downey Jr (who was sorely underused, and should've been cast as Rodney's son), and cameo roles by Kurt Vonnegut Jr, M Emmet Walsh, and a hillarious Sam Kinison.Rodney also takes a sarcastic poke at the ivory towers, apparently echoing some autobigraphical sentiment towards self-made men, such as himself, who make it big despite not having fancy diplomas to back them up.  One such scene puts his street smarts squarley at odds with a hooty professor who gets a lesson himself in how to open a manufacturing plant in the real world.If you like Rodney Dangerfield, rent this movie.

A gifted stand-up comedian, Rodney is an old school Las Vegas comic known for delivering scathing, self-deprecating, yet wholesomely witty one-liners. His unique comedy is further enhanced by his bulbous eyes, deep voice and hysterical intonations.Rodney plays Thornton Melon, an eccentric millionaire, doting father, and former college diving competition champ. Thornton went from rags to riches selling men's custom-tailored suits to the big and tall. His only child and son Jason is a freshman in college, painfully single, and having a tough time adjusting to academia, campus life, and his chosen sport - diving. Hilarity ensues when Thornton comes to his son's rescue by enrolling in the same university, partying, throwing money around and slacking off. Then he is literally put to the test, having to pass a series of exams, or get expelled by his nemesis, the pompous Dr. Phillip Barbay, Dean of Students. Thornton also has to learn to stop smothering his son and be a normal dad. Of course, Rodney doesn't do normal, which brings the laughs consistently, with an explosive dive competition-climax that has to be seen to be believed. Back to School immortalized Rodney Dangerfield like no other movie. This movie also has a great supporting cast (Burt Lancaster and the late Sam Kinison come to mind) and a fitting, cheery score by none other than Danny Elfman (three years before he did Batman and The Simpsons). You'll laugh and cheer for Thornton Melon, and after you do, you'll watch this wonderful 80's comedy gem again and again.

So I decided to go ahead and give Back to School a chance. I really had a good time watching it, I just miss comedies like this where it was dirty or over the top, it was just plain fun to watch and you have a good time viewing the film. Rodney is such a lovable goof and he always makes it look like he and the cast enjoy making these comedies. The story is so crazy, but so hilarious that it makes you wanna go back to school with Rodney and just have a good time with him and his son.Thornton Melon's father made one thing clear to him at a young age, no matter how old, young, poor, rich you are, education is one of the most important things in life. Well, Thornton has grown into a successful clothes store owner and is very rich and powerful. But when his son, Jason, is discouraged with college, Thornton goes back to school to help encourage his son to get through it. While for Jason it's all studies and trying to fit in, it's all fun and games for Thornton and he's having the time of his life while being the big man on campus.Back To School is a great comedy that I highly recommend, it's all in good fun and Rodney is just such a great comedian. I just loved it when he was going to the college to visit his son and he accidentally enters the sorority house and walks in on a girl showering and says Oh, don't worry, you're perfect, lol, I just couldn't stop laughing. Also I loved Keith Gordon in the film, I can't believe this guy didn't make it big in acting, but he just does such a terrific job keeping up with Rodney.

This movie became such a hit due to the story what better stuff could you ask for as Rodney Dangerfield as a self-made millionaire who becomes a college drop-in. Sure I know this story is far from real everybody knows that a high school dropout doesn't receive admission to college no matter how rich they may be! The scene with the dean (Ned Beatty) when Thornton Melon (Rodney Dangerfield) buys his way admission is just funny and crazy. This comedy is not like other comedies it is not a comedy of parody, Dangerfield makes Back to School funny with his dialogue and actions they are just down-to-earth even though we know the story is so not true. Other characters in Back to School that made this a very successful movie are Keith Gordon he was just right as the goofy son that Dangerfield drops in at college to help out. No matter how different you just wanted to cheer for his character so much as he tried to become a winner. Robert Downey Jr., Terry Farrell, and M. Emmet Walsh all gave great and funny performances. The characters who worked good with Rodney and great with the story had to be Sally Kellerman as the concerned and caring literature professor who makes Thornton Melon learn and understand that life is more than money and a good time. Paxton Whitehead also can't be forgotten as the cold and snobbish economics professor. I just love the scenes when Rodney puts him in his place! The funniest scene in the movie is the face to face between Rodney and Sam Kinison in history class, that is all most sure comedy history!

He's seen to it that it's full of memorable one-liners that are just as sassy as any he uses in his stand-up nightclub act.And he's surrounded himself with a cast that really gets into the spirit of things. SALLY KELLERMAN is the vivacious English professor that soon becomes the love of his life; ADRIENNE BARBEAU is his shrewish ex-wife; KEITH GORDON is the son who is not exactly Big Man on the Campus; and ROBERT DOWNEY, JR. is the kind of left-wing activist you can find on any college campus, making the most of a role that he could play in his sleep. For subtlety, if there is any, there's a Dean Martin (NED BEATTY) who allows the uneducated Dangerfield to enter the halls of ivy merely because he's got a pocket full of cash and wants to splurge it on the school's administration, good philanthropist that he is.It's strictly a funfest for RODNEY DANGERFIELD fans -- of which there are many, judging from the comments here -- but it's an enjoyable romp that has some telling truths to say about a variety of college subjects, all the while injecting its own brand of wild humor on every situation.

How can you go wrong? 'Back to School' is definitely a comedy worth seeing. It is one of the best of Rodney Dangerfield's performances.Jubilent Thorton Melon (Dangerfield) is a pretty wealthy businessman. As a kid (the younger Thorton is played by Jason Hervey), he never put much stock in school. It was enough to know the basics, but he just wanted to inherit the business. Now it's years later. He may be stuck in a rotten marriage, but otherwise, business is great. His son, Jason (Kieth Gordon), is having doubts however, about his future. He's a quiet kid with one solitary friend, Derek (Robert Downey, Jr. as a total fun-loving goofball), he's just a towel boy for the diving team, and even his grades aren't so hot. Thorton is willing to help his son out to put some self-esteem in the boy. So, Thorton dumps his dumb wife and grabs his slick driver, Lou (Burt Young), and off to college they go.Thorton pretty much makes a mockery out of a college education (although I guess that could be done anyways), expecting to coast through the semester by buying off those obstacles along the way. In fact, Thorton seems to be the campus hot shot now in part because of his wild attitude and extreme generosity (he thinks any problem just requires a little cash). He expanded Jason's and Derek's dorm to be high class resort. He hires a huge staff to do the homework for his finals. And, it starts to annoy those around him, especially his son, because he doesn't expect something to come to him so easily (like making the diving team or passing a test), and he doesn't want his dad to bribe someone to make it that easy. He's gotta show his father that once in a while, he has to put some real effort into doing things, or otherwise he's never going to learn anything, much less appreciate it. Thorton's excursion teaches his son to lighten up a little, too.It's a pretty good movie about what a middle-aged rich businessman would do as a college freshman. It's got a big 80s cast with Billy Zabka as the typical jock bully that he seemed to type casted for in those days. Likewise, Keith Gordon, who plays Thorton's son, Jason, is the typical timid geek type that he always seemed to be as well (see Christine). Frankly, I like the guy better as a director. Plus, Oingo Boingo rocks out the dormitory? And I think it is one of the best comedies I've seen Rondey Dangerfield in. His sarcasm is terrific when met with the resistance of the stuffy English professor who doesn't want Thorton around. In fact, Thorton, with his great sense of humor, gets everyone to lighten up.Have a go, eh?

Ned Beatty is hilarious as Dean Martin, a college administrator who never met a rich donator he didn't love.  Poorly educated but rich Rodney donates a ton of money as a bribe so he can be admitted, has a new school building named after him due to this generosity and several of the teachers have it out for him as a result.  Sam Kinison is hilarious as a dedicated psychotic history teacher and Sally Kellerman is great playing Rodney's college love interest (as well as the college poetry teacher.

Thirty years later, this colleague was twice my age with half my wage, while his cousin turned out to be the successful manager of six garages all over the town.So much for the merit of education! So when Alan Metter's Back to School came to its fifth minute, I was immediately thinking of this story. The film opens with young Thornton Meloni, decided to leave school and work with his father, an Italian immigrant who's obviously failed to communicate about the virtue of education. Was that a loss? Not quite the opening sequence is a brilliant illustration of the American Dream, showing Meloni's ascension, becoming Melon, the head of a 'Fat and Tall' tailor-made costumes empire. Whether it's Melon, or the garage owner, are typical self-made men who didn't wait for any certificate to work hard, they had the talent, the personality, and luck did the rest.And Rodney Dangerfield, with his bulging eyes, obnoxious mannerisms and self-deprecating one-liners, proves that you can be wealthy and successful in business without being corrupted by a snobbish etiquette or pompous arrogance. You can be among the city's top businessmen and speak people's language. There's also no doubt that 'education' isn't his strong suit he's not comfortable with tuxedos and his driver (played by Burt Young) looks like a truck driver crossed with a moving mug-shot from America's Most Wanted. So, it doesn't come as a surprise that the dinner organized by his gold-digging socialite second-wife gets as disastrous as Mr. Burns presenting his son Larry in the Simpsons episode that guest-starred Dangerfield. The divorce is quickly set and Melon had one urge, visiting his son, Jason, played by Keith Jordan.Jason is an interesting character, in a frustrating way, despite obvious diving skills inherited from his father, he's just the locker boy, and despite his only friend's encouragement to talk to the girl of his dreams, he's more or less resigned to give up (the friend is played with delightful zaniness by a young Robert Downey Jr., and you could tell the promising talent rising even from a secondary role). Melon can't believe Jason is not some fraternity member or just more popular, much more, that he's about to drop college. But the father's experience doesn't convince on the necessity of education, but like any father, he wants the 'best' for his son, and if it can set an example to his son, he'll also study with him, and pass the same exams.The set-up is as simple as that, but it says something very nice about the film, it's moved by the love of a father for his son, and all Melon's good intentions are built on that, no matter how over-the-top and sometimes disastrous they end up. But Dangerfield plays such a charming, positive, cheerful character that it's impossible to resist to his appeal, he makes everything fun and enjoyable, like a never-ending party, and the embarrassing moments cause more harm to him than his son. And what I liked about the film is that the son likes his father and doesn't mind his presence. In a lesser comedy, the father-and-son relationship would've been the source of predictable gags consisting on one ruining another's fun, but the dynamics is more subtle and touching, and makes the conflict more serious when it happens.And the conflict says a lot about the film's commentary on money and education. The class's jock and Jason's rival accuses him of being an opportunistic nouveau riche benefiting from his father's helps, including him being part of the diving team. Jason thinks his father bribed the coach (played by M. Emmet Walsh, oddly enough, a role he also played in Ordinary People). But the bribe accusation isn't that irrelevant as Melon literally bought his way to the school, through a generous donation, that left the spineless Dean speechless (Ned Beatty makes a funny pairing with Dangerfield) and that didn't please the Business Professor and main antagonist, Professor Barbay, played by Paxton Whitehead. But Melon thinks money is the answer.Melon is actually a pragmatic guy, and in what constitutes the best scene of the film, he deconstructs the whole theoretical approach of Barbay's business course, reminding him there are many extra-costs to count, from the politicians to grease, to the waste disposal, to the unions (and you see students taking notes). Melon has made his way by learning how to make things simple and quick, and if he can buy people to ghostwrite his work, if he can hire someone for the NASA to work on his son's project, he doesn't see any harm to it. Melon is ignoring the basis of education, which, as worthless as it can be (and it can) for a man's success is also the builder of a positive state of mind, something that allow people to surpass their level and learn things that go beyond practicality&#x85;.like a beautiful English teacher, played by Sally Kellerman, who'd unveil the man's sensitive side.As the fun comedy as it is, Back to School has the merit to keep constantly in line with its message, not much an hymn to education, but an invitation to enjoy the time that is given to have fun and learn, before getting to the real world. And on a personal level, it reminded me of my preppy and school years which ultimately made me realize that education is like Karate, we study things not to have to use them.Not sure this one-liner would have done well in this comedy&#x85; but there's one that I immediately put in my Top 10 funniest ever Say hello to my nieces (especially when you know the context).

And, Paxton Whitehead is very effective as Dr. Phillip Barbay, an economics professor that serves as an antagonist to Melon. Naturally, Dangerfield stole the show in his role, every single minute that he was on screen shined like gold, he put the 'L' back in laughs. But hey, that is usually expected in just about any movie that he appears in, and in this movie, that definitely applies to him.How many hilarious scenes does this movie contain? There are too many to list. Among them include the scene near the beginning featuring Melon's Tall And Fat Brand, then there is Melon's first economics class in which he keeps interrupting it, not to mention the scene where he donates the building. Then there's a scene featuring Sam Kinison as a professor who goes absolutely nuts while teaching his class. All in all, if you are a fan of Dangerfield, then the chances of you enjoying this movie are very high, as it contains a very big amount of laughs. So sit back and join Rodney Dangerfield on a trip to school that you will never forget, that is his 1986 marvel, Back To School.9/10 "},{"Title":"She gives great headache.....","Date":"15 February 2015","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sport","Review":" Millionaire businessman Thornton Melon is upset when his son Jason announces that he is not sure about staying at college. Thornton insists that college is the best thing for him, and to prove his point, he agrees to enroll in school along with his son. Thornton is a big hit on campus always throwing the biggest parties, knowing all the right people, but is this the way to pass college?.....Here in the UK, Dangerfield is a drama that was shown on the BBC back in the nineties starring some bloke your mum used to fancy, because he looked trustworthy, not a stand up comedian.So the only thing I've ever seen him in is Natural Born Killers. I knew of him, but the only films of this that had anything near a prolific release here were, Ladybugs, Rover Dangerfield, and this.And if it wasn't for him, this would have been your average fish out of water comedy,that would have had mild success, because during this stage of the eighties, college movies were the fashion, so to speak.But he lights up every scene he's in, treating the film like a stand-up routine rather than a narrative, and this kind of hides the predictable fish out of water cliché.But you find all the regular tropes that you would expect....The Professor who wants him to fail.... The Love interest who just happens to be seeing said professor..... The Jock who causes trouble..... The make or break exam..... And of course, the last minute act that saves the day......But it's never dull, there are a lot if laughs, and it's always good to see Downey Jr.A good addition to the sub-genre..

He's at his funniest and most engaging, reeling off one priceless one-liner after another; you just can't help but like his character. He plays Thornton Melon, a self made millionaire who created a big business without the benefit of a higher education. When his geeky college age son Jason (Keith Gordon) expresses desire to drop out, not happy with his lot in life, Thornton is motivated to do whatever he can to help out the kid. His brainstorm is simple enroll in college himself! He manages to buy his way in (donating money to a new business centre) and once settled in proceeds to not exactly take his education that seriously, becoming a life-of-the-party type who sometimes embarrasses Jason. He even has a team of professionals do his homework for him. When he's found out, it's up to him to actually learn some things in order to salvage the whole endeavour. With a screenplay co-written by Harold Ramis, director Alan Metter allows the cast and subsequently the viewer to simply have a lot of fun. The movies' good vibes are pretty hard to resist. There are some brilliant touches; just to name one, author Kurt Vonnegut Jr. cameos as himself, hired to write a paper about his own works, after which a professor exclaims that the writer doesn't know the first thing about Vonnegut! Dangerfields' lines are instantly quotable (They should donate my body to science fiction!) and he also has a whale of a time singing a cover of the Beatles tune Twist and Shout (the same year that Matthew Broderick did this in Ferris Bueller's Day Off). The supporting cast is equally solid and memorable, especially adorable Sally Kellerman as Dangerfields' English professor and love interest. Also appearing are Burt Young, Robert Downey Jr., lovely Terry Farrell, M. Emmet Walsh, Adrienne Barbeau, Karate Kid villain William Zabka, Ned Beatty, Severn Darden, the late, great Sam Kinison, Robert Picardo, Edie McClurg, Timothy Stack, and Jason Hervey of 'The Wonder Years'. It's particularly great to see composer Danny Elfman on screen, performing with his band at the time, Oingo Boingo. Overall the movie IS very much of its time, but this is nothing but good if you are like this viewer and retain a fondness for the comedies of this era. If Thornton weren't a basically likable man who just wanted the best for his son, this wouldn't work as well as it does. But it DOES work, and we want to see these characters succeed, and take satisfaction in the way things turn out. The choice of Aretha Franklins' Respect to accompany the end credits is most appropriate. Eight out of 10. "},{"Title":"Dangerfield's School Days","Date":"19 March 2012","Score":"","Genre":"Comedy, Romance, Sport","Review":" Back to School (1986) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Box office hit has Rodney Dangerfield playing Thorton Melon, a millionaire who decides to go back to school when his son (Keith Gordon) talks about dropping out. Melon is a hit on campus and even hits it off with one of his teachers (Sally Kellerman) but soon all the attention begins to push his son away. BACK TO SCHOOL is certainly a charming movie and it certainly has some funny moments but overall I don't think it works as well as it could have. For the most part the entire story is poorly written and there's really not too much that happens. The entire father-son relationship just comes off fake and especially towards the end when they have a falling out. This here leads to some scenes that are meant to be touching but they just come off rather melodramatic. Another problem I had is that there really aren't any funny moments that just happen. In other words, all of the funny material comes from Dangerfield's one-liners that he basically just looks into the camera and says. Some of these are certainly funny but the way they're filmed it really takes you out of the movie. With all of that said, yes, there's no question that seeing Dangerfield back at school contains a certain cuteness that can't be denied. The actor does a good job in the role as he has no problem throwing out the jokes and he handles the more dramatic moments just fine even if they are melodramatic. Burt Young does his typical good performance as does Kellerman in her role. Robert Downey, Jr. isn't too bad in his brief role and we get brief but entertaining spots by M. Emmet Walsh, Ned Beatty and Adrienne Barbeau. I found Gordon's performance somewhat annoying and the same with the quick cameo by Sam Kinison. BACK TO SCHOOL is pretty much pure 80s in term of its style and comedy. The cast makes it much better than it actually is but fans of Dangerfield will still want to check it out.

Thornton discovers that college is harder than it looks and must learn to be more responsible for his academic studies or he'll get expelled. Director Alan Metter, working from a bright and witty script co-written by Harold Ramis, keeps the pace hurtling along at a constant zippy rate, maintains a winningly wacky tone throughout, and, most of all, gives Dangerfield free reign to really strut his hilariously hearty and obnoxious stuff. The supporting cast are likewise on the money excellent and effective Sally Kellerman as sexy and passionate English professor Dr. Diane Turner, Burt Young as Thornton's grubby, loyal chauffeur/bodyguard Lou, Robert Downey, Jr. as Jason's sarcastic misfit roommate buddy Derek, Paxton Whitehead as stuffy, pompous economics professor Dr. Phillip Barbay, Ned Beatty as the jolly, unprincipled Dean David Martin, Terry Farrell as the sweet, fetching Valerie Desmond, Sam Kinison as crazed, irate history Professor Terguson, William Zabka as mean, cocky frat jerk Chas, M. Emmet Walsh as nice guy diving Coach Turnbull, Severn Darden as the flaky Dr. Borozini, and Adrienne Barbeau as Thornton's shrewish adulterous second wife Vanessa. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. has an amusing cameo as himself. Comic highlights include a wild barroom brawl, a rowdy frat bash (Oingo Boingo appear as themselves singing the great Dead Man's Party), and Thornton doing his famously dangerous Triple Lindy dive. Danny Elfman's jaunty score, Thomas E. Ackerman's slick cinematography, and the cool rock soundtrack are all up to speed. But it's Dangerfield who makes this picture such an always enjoyable and often sidesplitting treat to watch The Rodman's obviously having a ball in a tailer-made lead role and brings a positively infectious sense of incredibly lively and zany fun to the whole film that's impossible to either resist or dislike. An absolute hoot.

Taking his father's advice to work harder, we flash forward many years and Rodney opens up his own clothing store business called Tall and Fat. (Some very funny lines in this part of the film, when we see the ad commercial!) Meanwhile, Rodney discovers that his no-good wife is unfaithful at a party, and Rodney's son, played by Keith Gordon, is having problems fitting in at his college.Eager to help his son, and to instill confidence in himself, Rodney decides to visit him at college, and discovers that they can both help and learn from each other, so Rodney decides to enroll as well!!! He pulls a few strings by using the company funds from his Tall and Fat store to donate a new business building for the school. After being accepted by Dean Martin, (LOL!) Rodney's antics don't suit well with one particular professor, who intends on making life as miserable for him as possible. Meanwhile, he falls in love with the beautiful English professor who is not only teaching his Literature class, but also happens to be dating the business professor who hates him! Dangerfield struggles because all through life, the movie shows that he has been somewhat of a slacker himself. Using his business background, he bribes professional people to do his son's and his homework for him while rapidly becoming the campus party guy. His son Jason has trouble making the diving team, until Rodney pulls a few strings with the coach. Eventually, Jason becomes fed-up, because the entire campus learns what Rodney is doing. Jason wants to do his own work. Father and son have a big blow up fight about this, and the college administrator's determine that in order to prove evidence that Rodney did not plagiarize his work, he has to take oral final exams in all of his subjects.What I like most about Back to School, is that Dangerfield finally shows that he can be funny, without being obscene. There is a soft, sympathetic side to him in this movie that I don't see from him in other films. All of the supporting roles of Rodney's professors are very good. Rodney's jokes about his classroom and exam experiences, are well related from college students, especially if college was/is a trying time for them.The only downside is the song Twist and Shout. It was not only too long, but unnecessary. However, the movie is recommended. See Back to School. It is a fun time!

To me that one is a lot funnier than this one, which has some good stuff within it, but it just runs to long and gets to sentimental near the end. The story has a successful business man who never went to school with a son in college. Well the son is not having a good time of it and wants to drop out, but his father does not want him to. Well the son says the father did not go so why should he and this spurs the father (played by Dangerfield) to go to the same college to prove a point. There are some funny things initially, but like a lot of comedies of this type it gets to sentimental at times, there are a few lags between the laughs and after a point you just wish it to be over. Dangerfield is mostly funny in this one, though he is at his best near the beginning of the movie while at a party thrown by his wife. A few good scenes when he is first going to college as I enjoyed his first meeting with Sam Kinneson as a professor. Like I said though this movie just seems to go on to long and they have to invent plot points to make the movie more serious than it need be.
