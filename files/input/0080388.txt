[{"Title":"A gem","Date":"12 September 2002","Score":"52 out of 68 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" (Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.)Europeans have always delighted in introducing America to itself. (I am thinking of de Tocqueville and Nabokov.) There is something very valuable about seeing ourselves through the eyes of others. In Atlantic City, assumptions about the American way of life, the American dream and the America reality, circa 1978, are examined through the artistry of master French film director, Louis Malle (Murmur of the Heart (1971), Pretty Baby (1978), Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987), etc.)The film begins with a shot of Sallie Matthews (Susan Sarandon at 34) at the kitchen sink of her apartment squeezing lemons and rubbing them on her arms, her neck, her face as Lou Pasco (Burt Lancaster at 68) watches unbeknownst to her from across the way, the window of his apartment looking into hers. She works at a clam bar in a casino on the boardwalk, which is why she smells like fish, which is why she is squeezing lemon on herself to get rid of the smell. She is taking classes to be a blackjack dealer. Her dream is to go to Monaco and deal blackjack in one of resort casinos and perhaps catch a glimpse of Princess Grace. She listens to French tapes and achieves...an amusing accent. He is a has-been who never was, a pathetic old numbers runner well past any dream of his prime, pretending to be a fancy man as he picks up a few extra bucks waiting on an invalid woman.Enter a hippy couple with all their belongings on their backs. It turns out that he is Sallie's estranged husband, a deceitful little guy who has found a bag of cocaine that he intends to cut and sell; and she is Sallie's not too bright sister, very pregnant. They need a place to stay and have the gall to impose on her.Both Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances, as was director Louis Malle and writer John Guare for his script. But none of them won. This was the year of On Golden Pond with Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn taking the Oscars while Warren Beatty won Best Director for Reds. (Best film was Chariots of Fire with Colin Welland winning the Oscar for his original screenplay.) Nonetheless, Lancaster and Sarandon are outstanding, and they are both beautifully directed by Malle. Lancaster in particular demonstrated that at age 68 he could still fill up the screen with his sometimes larger than life presence. The familiar flamboyance and sheer physical energy that he displayed in so many films, e.g., Come Back, Little Sheba (1952), From Here to Eternity (1953), The Rose Tattoo (1955), Elmer Gantry (1960), to name four of my favorites, are here properly subdued. He moves slowly and is easily winded. He is a sad, cowardly old man whom Malle, to our delight, will miraculously transform.Sarandon's performance is also one of her best, on a par with, or even better than her work in Thelma and Louise (1991) for which she was also nominated for Best Actress and also did not win. She is an actress with legs (this is a pun and an allusion to an inside joke about her famous other attributes&#x96;nicely displayed in Pretty Baby--over which perhaps too much fuss has already been made!)--an actress with legs, as in a fine wine that will only get better with age. She, like Goldie Hawn, Catherine Deneuve and a few others, have the gift of looking as good (or better) at fifty as they did at thirty.Louis Malle films are characterized by a tolerance of human differences, a deep psychological understanding, a gentle touch and an overriding sense of humanity. Atlantic City is no exception. What Malle is aiming at here is redemption. He wants to show how this pathetic old man finds self-respect (in an ironic way) and how the clam bar waitress might be liberated. But he also wants to say something about America, and he uses Atlantic City, New Jersey--the lungs of Philadelphia, the mafia's playground, the New Yorker's escape, a slum by the sea saved (actually further exploited) by the influx of legalized gambling in the seventies--as his symbol. He begins with decadence and ends with renewal and triumph, and as usual, somewhere along the way, achieves something akin to the quality of myth. Even though he emphasizes the tawdry and the commonplace the untalented trio singing off key, the slums semi-circling the casinos where Lou sells numbers, the boarded-up buildings, the sad, tiny apartments about to be torn down, Robert Goulet as a cheap Vegas-style lounge act, etc., in the end we feel that it's not so bad after all.I should also mention Kate Reid who played Grace, the invalid, ex-beauty queen widow of a mobster, who orders Lou about. She does a great job. Her character too will be transformed.If the late, great Louis Malle was running the world the gross transgressors would surely get theirs and the rest of us would find forgiveness for our sins, and renewal.

At the same time, an elderly, small-time hood (Burt Lancaster) is stuck taking care of a gangster's widow (Kate Reid). Sarandon's husband and her younger sister ran off together and unexpectedly reappear looking for a place to stay. Her sister is now pregnant and her low-life husband is trying to sell drugs stolen from a big-time dealer in Philadelphia. Sarandon's husband meets Lancaster in a bar while trying to set up a deal to sell the drugs, and he convinces Lancaster to be his mule.  Lancaster and Sarandon being neighbors -- with her brother in law as the mutual acquaintance -- are brought together and become involved in more trouble than they ever thought imaginable.The refreshing aspect of this motion picture is that it avoids the typical Hollywood pitfall where character development and dialogue play second fiddle to car chases and stunt scenes. In Atlantic City the odious characters and sticky situations are secondary to the development/relationships of the lead characters.  This is the first excellent performance on film of a young Sarandon, and one of the finest performances of Lancaster's distinguished career.This film has been butchered on cable, VHS, and laserdisc.

It's well above the routine. Malle knows how to tell a story conventionally, without screaming shock effects or outsize explosions or in-your-face directorial banner headlines. When a pistol is fired, it doesn't boom like dirty Harry's. It simply pops unobtrusively. It all flows along smoothly. And it's aptly titled. The story is as much about Atlantic City as it is about the residents and visitors we meet. It's like a Robert Altman movie except that it has a fascinating narrative that draws us in. We see the city first. A decrepit faux urban setting whose good days are long in the past. (Woodrow Wilson used to summer nearby.) It was called the lungs of Philadelphia. It boomed as a summer resort before commercial airlines vulgarized travel and brought Miami and Bermuda within easy temporal reach of the Northeast corridor. The older apartment buildings, the ones with Queen Anne towers, are being demolished, to be replaced by the casinos that everyone assumes will bring prosperity back. (They never did. The money stayed in the casinos or went out of state.) But those sturdy old brick palaces were built to last and the apartments we see are shabby but cozy too. People have made nests in them over the years. The residents have accomodated their existences to the frames of the places they live in. People work in oyster bars, or run numbers in the falling-apart rubbish-strewn black neighborhoods. They can, if they have the money to do so, dine in reasonably good restaurants or stroll on the boardwalks, and we can almost hear the hoofbeats of yesteryear.What modern Atlantic City is to its brassy past, Burt Lancaster is to his own history. He stalks the streets in his overcoat, wearing the only tie he owns, mutters things about how important he used to be, once having shared a cell with Bugsy Siegal. He used to have to kill people once in a while, he tells a young man confidentially. He always felt bad about it afterward and used to take a long swim in the ocean to feel clean again. I never saw the Atlantic Ocean until today, says the kid. Lancaster turns around and looks out to sea and waves expansively. You should of seen the ocean then, he says. The Atlantic Ocean was really somethin' in them days. His glorious career, it turns out, has about the same epistemological status as that of the city he hasn't been outside of for the past twenty years. The Atlantic Ocean was really somethin' in them days. What a line! And Lancaster handles it well too. He's no Crimson Pirate here, just a quiet older guy with curly white hair trying to make a buck by running errands for small-time hoods, and trying to sell a silver cigarette case, a memento of his past, for a double sawbuck. He looks exactly right too. Not old, exactly, but well aged, like a mature burgundy. His generously featured face hasn't drooped with the passage of the years. His eyebrows are dark and set off his surprisingly gentle eyes. He doesn't clip off the terminal contours of his sentences, as he did before. It's a splendid performance.His performance is matched by that of the other principle actors. There are some quietly amusing episodes between him and the woman he takes care of. (There is also a pretty gruesome lethal stabbing, although without blood.) Only the villains are one-dimensional villains. Susan Sarandon is marvelous as the young oyster-bar employee who wants to become a casino dealer, even if it means putting up with hits from the oily French guy who teaches the fine art of dealing in a school run by the casinos. He smokes with a cigarette holder and sounds like Charles Boyer, the swine. What a fine actress she is. Even here, dressed in threadbare clothes, her skirts around her ankles, wearing clumsy boots, her hair a mop of Scottish red, she fixes a viewer's interest when she's on the screen. She's as vulnerable under those oyster shells as Lancaster is when he discovers he can't protect her from the villains. And the two of them have a tender love scene together, and later a more raucous good time. In the end they go their separate ways -- Lancaster back to his destiny, and Sarandon in search of hers. The characters in the film bounce around at first, at odds with one another, or simply unaware of the others' presence, but Malle draws them together into a community whose welfare we finally come to care about. It's a fine movie.

Kate Reid as a faded gangster's moll is a standout in the fine supporting cast.  This is perhaps Louis Malle's finest movie, and, in my opinion, one of the 10 best movies of the 80s.

This time he's Lou Pascal, an old-time small hood playing out his days in pathetic manner in a dingy Atlantic City. In fact, seedy describes Atlantic City in this picture.There's nothing seedy about the opening scene, however. It's an attention- grabber, at least if you're a male. We see Susan Sarandon, squeezing lemon juice over her breasts at the kitchen window. Later, we see her do the same thing.The film is no lemon, however. It's an excellent film and Lancaster, Sarandon (Sally Matthews) and her husband Dave (Robert Joy) comprise most the early going. Joy's role as Sally's loser druggie husband was ugly but he doesn't last long in the film. The second half of the film features mostly the two stars, both of whom were up for Academy Awards for their performance (and lost out in a sentimental vote for the On Golden Pond crowd). Not only do Lancaster and Sarandon excel, but so does director Louis Malle.Malle makes this almost a modern-day film noir with the grittiness of the characters and the setting, when Atlantic City looked its worst. It's just solid film-making all-around, and few people could play intense characters, young or old, as well as Lancaster.My only regret is the transfer on the DVD. It's a little grainy and this film deserves better treatment. although, come to think of it - the grain is appropriate considering it's a gritty story.

He plays a one-time gangster (in his own mind at least quite a big shot) who, like the city that gives the film its title, isn't what he used to be. Susan Sarandon, in an early-career performance, plays a woman who works in one of the casinos and whose life intersects with Lancaster's because of a drug deal her no-good husband was involved in. The two don't ever become friends exactly, but they each get something from the other until the sad ending, when Lancaster realizes that there isn't a place in his life for Sarandon, and that there may not be a place in the world for him.The film is a low-key character study that completely satisfies, and gives Lancaster perhaps his last great role.Grade A "},{"Title":"I Don't Wear Seatbelts, I Don't Believe in Gravity","Date":"21 July 2003","Score":"15 out of 24 people found the following review useful","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" Atlantic City is a great film where the setting is just as rich and complex a character as the people traversing its streets (and boardwalk). Louis Malle delivers one of the most understated directorial turns working with a delightfully witty script (that has many great lines, like the one above) and a great cast (Lancaster perfect in a comeback role, Sarandon stunning in one of her early great performances). Things are so subtle here that you don't even realize you just watched a work of art until it is over. Atlantic City is shown truthfully (in despair, in shadowed glory, and in the glitz and glamor that was to return thanks to the casinos circa the late 70's) and the people inhabiting it gloriously reflect all of those varying degrees. This is the human condition (searching for that first break or that last chance) in all its quiet charms.

Atlantic City is undergoing a transformation, with new casinos and hotels dotting its shoreline while a few blocks in, out of the tourists sight, the full time residents live in what's left over from the past. Louis Malle captures it all with this story about a retired small time member of the local organized crime syndicate (Burt Lancaster) who comes into a small fortune worth of stolen cocaine when the guy that stole it (Robert Joy) is killed by the dealers who meant to buy it in the first place down in Philadelphia, and are now hot on his heels as well. Back in the life, though unwittingly, he sells the coke to an ongoing poker game in one of the suites in a new hotel, bit by bit, and falls into the romance of his dreams with young Susan Sarandon, whom he watched every night from his hotel room as she bathed her breasts with lemon juice in her room across the way. Like the refurbishing city its set in, he feels rejuvenated and in one instance even fearless in the face of the ruthless Philly dealers. The film put Lancaster back in the limelight for a while, and refreshingly so. Its gritty realism and characters, especially Joy, who makes an excellent hippie con-man, marked the end of an era of that realistic 70's urban crime drama genre that deftly mixed romance with drugs and violence, and portrayed the underworld, mostly minus the cops, so well.

Malle achieves directorial power through camera work that is near-objective and not judgmental, similar to his far-more-disturbing (but definitely worth watching) Pretty Baby. As previous reviewers have mentioned, Atlantic City's sensibility also puts one in mind of similar cinematic masters Anderson and Altman.Sally (Susan Sarandon) is a comically ambitious young waitress, Lou (Burt Lancaster) a comically dignified old two-bit hood. That is to say, they are, respectively, a wanna-be and a has-been (or perhaps more of a never-was). They meet and interact over the course of about 48 hours that bring them together briefly and bring both what they seek most Sally a fresh start, Lou the chance to start over.The greatness of a film can often be evaluated by how fascinating the secondary characters are. Grace (Kate Reid), Lou's verbally abusive friend/lover, is the widow of one of Lou's fellow small-time crooks; she has spent much of her life being taken care of and staying in bed. She, too, achieves transformation and transcendence; at the end, it is she who finally is taking care of someone else (Sally's pathetically naive, pregnant younger sister), getting out of bed and dressing up to promenade the faded boardwalk on the arm of Lou, who has finally earned her respect. This last scene shows that these two old folks -- like Atlantic City itself -- may be down, but far from out.

Lancaster plays Lou, a small-time mobster from the old days of Atlantic City. He is handsome, dresses very grandly, and pretends that he used to be in the big-time. Actually he worked in some menial job for a mobster and now takes care of his widow Grace (Kate Reid) who appears bedridden at first. He takes care of her dog, makes her food, rubs her limbs to increase circulation, and occasionally sleeps with her. She's verbally abusive to him. Grace came to Atlantic City in the '40s as a contestant in a Betty Grable lookalike contest, met her future husband, and never left.Lou meets a young waitress and would-be croupier, Sally, and their lives soon collide. He's attracted to her. Sally's sister has run off with Sally's husband, and the two show up to stay with her. Her sister is pregnant. Sally's husband Dave is there to do a drug deal; he meets Lou and stores the cocaine in Lou's apartment. People are after him, so he sends Lou to someone's apartment on a delivery, and Lou is to pick up the money. When Lou arrives home after the errand, Dave is dead. The thugs didn't get their dope, so eventually they turn to Sally. In fact, Lou has the dope and also the money from the first delivery. And he plans on taking up where Dave left off.This is such a well-done film, hearkening back to the old days of Atlantic City just as the city is being rebuilt as a eastern Las Vegas. Lou is part of the old days; Sally is ambitious and wants to better herself. Lou, never anybody, now longs to be somebody for her.The acting is wonderful. Burt Lancaster is magnificent as Lou, an old man who still has young dreams. It's a very subtle performance, very touching and sometimes funny. Susan Sarandon does a great job as Sally, creating a totally believable character.John Guare has written a great script, the first important component of a film, and it was in the hands of a master, Louis Malle. The film was made in Canada, and I recognized many Canadian actors, but the location shots are excellent.Highly recommended, a sublime experience.

As you might have reasonably guessed from the title role this all takes place in Atlantic City which in 1980 was undergoing a rebirth.The one time resort town was undergoing a face-lift when this film takes place. Legalized gambling was coming in and a lot of the old town was being torn down to make room for spanking new casinos. Burt's story parallels that of Susan Sarandon who is working in one of the hotel buffet lines and also going to school to learn to be a dealer when new casinos do finally open up. They live in adjoining buildings.But like the proverbial bad penny her husband Robert Joy shows up with a pregnant Holly McLaren. Joy has stolen a nice little package of heroin from the mob and he's looking to make a quick sale. He brings Lancaster into the deal, but manages to get himself killed in the process. That forces Lancaster and Sarandon into an alliance of convenience, but who would think at Burt's age and he was 76 when he made Atlantic City, he'd find love as well. Both Lancaster and Sarandon are so good as players they don't look foolish in the romance department.And after over 30 years in the lower levels of the underworld, Burt finally makes his bones. It's a surprise unto himself.Atlantic City was shot in Atlantic City, an Atlantic City we'll not see any more because it's now looking so different than what you're seeing in this film. Some interior stuff was shot in Montreal and the film wrapped on the last day of 1980 and released in 1981.Atlantic City got Oscar nominations for Lancaster and for Susan Sarandon and both ran up against On Golden Pond and lost to Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn. Director Louis Malle and the film itself were up as well, but lost to Warren Beatty for Reds and Chariots of Fire for Best Film. Chariots of Fire writer Colin Welland also beat writer John Guare for Best Original Screenplay. Five nominations, but not a winner for any of the categories.Still Atlantic City has become a minor classic and it did revive the career of Burt Lancaster somewhat. Lancaster was aging and he knew it. He transitioned nicely into character parts in his last productive decade as a result of Atlantic City.Not a bad reason for him to take this film assignment.

Susan Sarandon offers solid support with a typically excellent performance, while Michel Piccoli and Kate Reid make the most of their respective roles (both eccentrics in their own way).The film provides a surprising milieu for Malle but he manages to bring a European sensibility or, if you like a Continental style, to a fundamentally American setting. While there are a couple of exciting action sequences (most memorable is Lancaster's killing of two hoods/drug dealers, his first 'hit' which makes him giddy with delight and finally proud of himself, after having spent his life spinning tall tales of his stature in the underworld!), it's clearly a character-driven piece - courtesy of John Guare's incisive script - and its tone introspective and bittersweet over a vanished way of life (the good old days as they're typically referred to); and, yet, everything is not bleak but actually quite funny on occasion! Atlantic CITY deservedly won several accolades at the time - including the Golden Lion Prize at the Venice Film Festival and quite a few plums to Lancaster himself - but, then, it was criminally neglected at the Oscars (even if the film was up for the 5 top awards and was, in my opinion, better than most of the eventual winners)!

You will love it because they are all crooked and they all want only one thing, to fool and rob the others. Killing is not really their job, but they enjoy doing it when it is not by accident and they relish the sensations they get when it is by accident. They rob, they deal and not only cards, they kill and assassinate, they cheat and they lie, they show off and they pretend, in one words they are all freaks who are petty criminals of no real nature and ambition. They manage to kill one another for a few thousand dollars, mind you something like thirteen or maybe seventeen thousand. Peanuts, even in 1980 or some time before.That was the time when Atlantic City was finding some new gambling dimension after the downfall, when Las Vegas was investing beyond its own city limits and on the east coast for a while, that is to say close to New York, Philadelphia and some other cities of that size. That could not be the big losers and the big betters and the big winners, but many regular small or average addicted gamblers are more profitable than a few erratic big ones.And when we are speaking of small, we mean small. Some plain white powder cut down by half anyway for twice the price. That powder was stolen and the money that came with it was just as much stolen as the white powder itself, from the first thief, to the second thief, to third thief, and the stolen money goes around just as much as the stolen white powder on a never ending merry-go-round.Among these small young amateurish criminals a couple of two older and by now wasted uncouth people are trying to get everything for themselves and yet they realize their age does not fit that kind of activity and life, and they just collect a few crumbs and they let the only surviving younger one get away with the loot.The only really good interest of the film is the decadent dimension of it. The younger generation was in the process of taking over but the golden boys had not arrived yet, the yuppies as they were going to be called. But all the same, it reeks of decadence with an after taste of poverty, particularly mental poverty. That world took so much time and energy to get wiped away. That was the time when a completely new approach was necessary and the older actor known as Ronald Reagan was going to be elevated to the position of president and that will bring this and this will mean that.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU "},{"Title":"Some Great Scenery and Acting","Date":"6 July 2013","Score":"","Genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance","Review":" Watch this if...you want to see a well acted drama film that has some really nice scenery of Atlantic City.

The opening voyeuristic gaze towards a young Susan Sarandon's bare breasts is a brazen invitation to a tale of lust and passion, but when it reveals its beholder is a weather-beaten codger, an ethical uneasiness has been motivated on the subject matter as a knee-jerking response, a December-may obsession has its intrinsic inclination to prompt its viewers with polarized acceptance. Luckily, Burt Lancaster is spry and self-aware as the pip-squeak, who sends off a dignity-ballasted aplomb even when he is dictated by his old flame for money, and Malle and screenwriter John Guare mercifully glistens his twilight years with a belated opportunity to spice up his low-end life, and the ending is a tad out of left field but also understandable with its benevolent gesture to a sympathetic soul. This is authentically Ms. Sarandon's big breakthrough role, a simple girl always on-the-make and striving for a better life (getting married with a sad sack to get out of a provincial town, taking croupier class to secure a job in the casino), not that Oscar-worthy in my opinion, but she is a natural performer to oscillates between spitfire honesty and self-serving shrewdness; by contrast, Lancaster's Oscar-nomination is more deserving, merely a cipher would be left unnoticed at the shady corner of casino shindig, finally pays his dues to save a lady and revitalize his own life, though Sarandon's sexual allure is the precondition, Malle and Guare carefully skirt around the prickly issue by injecting a more acceptable closure of their relationship. Kate Reid, as garish as she is in the role of an aging silk-stocking widow, embellishes the film with her own way of levity (the ineffable expression when Lancaster cops a feel in her bed) while other supporting cast is purely bells and whistles. I cannot say this is Malle's apotheosis, my favorite among his oeuvre (so far) is still THE FIRE WITHIN (1963, 9/10), nevertheless Atlantic CITY never loses its zest in spinning a yarn for the aged generation, and it is also a sensible elegy to those who dies without fulfilling their dreams, it is never too late to shoot a few mobsters!

This movie is both an unconventional love story and a crime drama but it's also a story about past disappointments and dreams of a better future.Sally Matthews (Susan Sarandon) is an ambitious young woman who left her drab life in Canada to look for something better in Atlantic City. She works at a local oyster bar but is also learning French and training to be a blackjack dealer as she dreams of someday working in a casino in Monte Carlo. At the end of her working day, she returns to the run down apartment block where she lives and routinely cuts lemons and rubs the juice into her upper body to eliminate the smell of fish.Lou Pascal (Burt Lancaster) is an elderly numbers runner who lives in a neighbouring apartment and regularly watches Sally's nightly ritual. In the past, he used to work for some notorious gangsters who he greatly admired but these days he takes care of the bedridden Grace Pinza (Kate Reid) who's his old boss' widow. She lives in the same building and habitually insults and humiliates him because she knows he depends on the money she pays him.Sally's past life is brought back into sharp focus when her ex-husband Dave (Robert Joy) unexpectedly turns up with her pregnant sister Chrissie (Hollis McLaren) who's the current woman in his life. Sally is angry that they've followed her to her new home but even more serious problems follow as Dave has stolen a substantial quantity of cocaine from some mobsters in Philadelphia and they're on his tail. Dave gets to know Lou and uses him to help to sell the dope.When the Philadephia mob catch up with Dave and kill him, Lou is left with the cocaine and a significant amount of money. This transforms his life as he suddenly has the means to buy a new suit and hat and be generous to Sally as they begin a relationship. Suddenly this impoverished, lonely old man who's nostalgic for the good old days and tells people exaggerated stories about his exploits and importance in the criminal world, finds himself financially well off. Even better, however, when Sally's threatened by the gangsters who think that she must have their stolen cocaine, he steps in and protects her and this makes him feel incredibly proud and exhilarated.Neither Sally nor Lou genuinely expect their offbeat relationship to be forever but it does, nevertheless, have a very positive effect on both their lives.Atlantic City is well written and skilfully balances the poignancy of its story with some moments of humour and a very unexpected ending. Its greatest quality, however, is its ability to convey so powerfully, the plight of its two main characters who are both regretful about the disappointments of their pasts and preoccupied by dreams of a better future. Their circumstances are portrayed with great sensitivity and warmth and placing them in an environment that is also undergoing a period of transformation is extremely effective.Burt Lancaster is equally as convincing in portraying Lou's pathetic nostalgia for his fictionalised past as he is at conveying his immense pride and excitement when he successfully protects Sally. His performance and that of Susan Saradon are top class and contribute massively to the success of this wonderful movie.

For lack of a better tag, and because both city and script are built around the magnetic lure of easy money, the film might be called a crime story, but the richness of John Guare's screenplay, filled as it is with broken dreams and rose colored memories (says a nostalgic Bert Lancaster, You should've seen the Atlantic Ocean back then&#x85;) can't be pigeon-holed so lightly.

It has an excellent acting of Burt Lancaster as Lou, and then young Susan Sarandon. Lou is an old man who used to talk too much about things he never did. He liked to say that he worked with Al Capone, Luciano and other gangsters, and that he was famous in Las Vegas. Lou, in conclusion, talked a lot but did little. However, he was able to find means for his subsistence, being the lover and servant of an old woman, and taking numbers from different people for playing illegal lottery in Atlantic city. His life was blessed the day he met a young guy who was stealing coca left in a telephone cabin. Lou knew the entire guy was doing with the drug, he was able to involve himself in this business, and continued smuggling even after the guy was discovered and killed by the true smugglers. Lou made a lot of money and, by coincidence, wanted the guy's wife (Sally). He made a lot of good services to her when her husband was killed, and finally could touch her body as he desired. Lou also was able to kill the true smugglers. He could not believe it when he did. This incidence forced Lou and Sally to leave Atlantic city for a while. The fact is that he knew well that Sally was to leave him and to take some money from him, and he let her go and came back to Atlantic City continuing smuggling.  Lou was a person who talked too much and wanted to show himself as a great man, he was also kind with his friends. Nearly at the end of the film when he read the news of two smugglers killed, he innocently told the receptionist of the hotel that he was the killer, something that the receptionist took as a lie.

Trying to pick himself up in whatever way he can he one day meets up with Sally Matthews (Oscar nominated Susan Sarandon) who is trying to become a casino croupier and realise her dream to go to Monte Carlo.

A likable, charming, quite enigmatic but very friendly man named Lou Pascal, a old resident of Atlantic City who gets with his neighbor (Susan Sarandon) after the murder of her husband, Dave (Robert Joy), whom Lou recently met and started a business that might complicate the lives of everyone involved with him. Louis Malles's Atlantic City is a reminder that cities can be reborn and people's lives can do the same too as long as they know how to find each other in this complicated and dangerous world. The author of this is famous play-writer John Guare of the famous play Six Degrees of Separation and in this film we are reminded through the whole experience about the connections of life and how they work sometimes for good things, other times for bad things. And the city is constantly presented as a different place than in its older days, everything's being demolished (including the place where the main characters live) where new casinos will be made.Lou is a sad figure in the beginning, his mob days are over and now he's taking care of old lady (Kate Reid), wife of a old friend of his, and she keeps bothering this guy all the time, ringing his bell wherever she needs him. His resurrection will appear when he mets Dave and starts doing some drug dealing business that will give him a lot of money and also show to himself that life can be good again. And there's his close relation with Dave's wife, first watching her at distance while she baths herself with lemons (the beautiful opening scene); and then helping her after Dave's death. Destiny will prepare some surprises to these characters in this magnificent place called Atlantic City.The plot is easy to follow, very simple and very absorbing, very good written (the sequence of Dave's death is one of the most planned moments in film history with a thrilling chase through a car elevator). And the acting? The best possible! Lancaster and Sarandon have a great chemistry on screen, and like I said he was born to perform this role, can't imagine other actor playing. Sadly, it lost out all the five big awards in which was nominated for the Oscar, but at least, it built a enormous reputation within its audience and critics making one of the best films ever made in 1980's, a true cult film.

Malle's direction in showing the old and new, the past and the future, with Atlantic City as the backdrop (gambling had only been legalised in New Jersey in 1979) is beyond criticism. Lancaster and Sarandon represent all this from the character side and both give exception performances. The plot in many ways plays second fiddle to the character building, the relationship between the two protagonists and the numerous metaphors used throughout.Robert Joy has stolen a bag of cocaine from the mob and is soon on the run with his pregnant girlfriend (McLaren) and hides out at her sister's flat (Sarandon), who is also his ex-wife. He then by chance, meets Lancaster (who is also Sarandon's neighbour and is infatuated with her), who likes to make out he was a big time person, but is and always was a nothing! This leads to Lancaster helping out in what he hopes will make him a somebody at last before a completely new city he won't know is built and people who don't want to know him arrive.If you haven't seen this or heard much about it, please do so.

John Guare's loopy script is played at just the right speed, and the funny lines of dialogue--like wobbly baseballs--come at you in slow-motion (they catch you unaware). Present-day oyster bar waitress/ croupier-in-training Susan Sarandon crosses paths with former Old World gangster Burt Lancaster while dealing with her estranged drug-trafficking husband, a relationship that ignites a final fire under the romantic-minded gentleman who remembers Atlantic City the way it used to be. Malle seems to personally relate to Guare's theme of a gambling town (and its inhabitants) in transition. It may indeed be the best work of the filmmaker's career, and Burt Lancaster visibly relishes the chance to be quick and adept and clever again; he's like a lion relearning how to roar. The mood is occasionally muted, and the deliberate pacing might put some viewers off--but, if so, it wouldn't be for long. Atlantic City sneaks up on you.

Soon her dead beat lowlife happens upon Lou, who has been yearning for Sally a long timethey are neighbors..he watches her bath her naked flesh with lemons, and proposes a partnership of sorts for distributing coke to a rich man. The dead beat husband knocked up Sally's sister, Chrissie(Hollis McLaren)who is too impressionable for her own good. You have an amusing turn by Michel Piccoli as Joseph, the man who trains card dealers so that they won't lose focus if a group of con artists try to read and cheat. Soon the dead beat husband(Robert Joy, who fits the bill)is murdered when the ones whose cocaine he stole find him. They will soon go after Sally who has no clue that Lou is the man with the dope and money that was to go into her husband's hands. Soon Lou and Sally will fall in love as Lou pays for the dead beat husband's airlift and burial in Canada. The money and coke, though, will be sought after as the hoods who murdered the dead beat husband will probe Sally for what actually belongs to them.The film's seedy drug and money sub-plot is merely a diversion or plot point to set up the meeting between Lou and Sally as they find the spark despite their age gap. Burt Lancaster seems to have found the sad tragedy behind the supposed mob guy. He lives a lie and deceives himself often, only realizing his whole life is a joke in a moment of clarity when the hoods, who find Sally and smack her around for information about the drugs and loot, hold him at bay as he couldn't protect her. The other moment of realization comes when he shoots and kills them as they plan to do Sally harm and end their meetings on a sour note.Kate Reid steals every scene as Grace Pinza, an elderly widow of famed mobster Cookie Pinza, for who she constantly reminds Lou of his failings as a real mobster as he takes care of her. She is pretty much an arthritic head case who doesn't cease to remind Lou where he'd be without her. Underneath all this is a bond they truly have. Lou really does depend on Grace and vice versa. She is another reminder of a past Atlantic City that now is a decaying relic.What Lou and Sally develop over the course of the film is magic. I totally really only thought of their age gap glancingly for they just spark and function on screen so well. There's a great scene where Lou admits to peeping in on Sally's lemon bathing and she seems so turned on by his honesty and in, especially, how Lou describes it in such erotic detail. It's an event in Lou's life, every night, that actually brings feeling. I think that them finding each other brought life back into Lou. As the film closes, we know that Lou and sally was never meant to be. She could leave Atlantic City, but Lou is too much of a fixture. He, in a sense, is Atlantic City, just like Grace and that old decaying building that will soon be driven to the ground giving way to a new more modern age.

Also side characters in the story like her sister, husband etc seem enveloped by the 70s - sort of transitional hippies. Definitely a time-stamp.

This is what I consider the hidden meaning behind this Atlantic City based fairytale by Louis Malle. Slow moving stories like this always have some big life meaning lurking behind it's characters, which is very true of this piece. Basically, Sarandon is working to become a card dealer in the city with a minor goal of ridding herself of her drug dealer husband and Lancaster's character is kind of a servant to a washed-up old lady and is trying to make the here and now as good as the good old days. He's attracted to Sarandon's character because of her youthful spirit and she's attracted to him because of his romantic flair and his tendency to want to protect those in his life. There are a lot of subplots in this story but what I have already said is the meat of it. This is a movie that you have to let grow on you.

(Is Atlantic City a metaphor for the filmmakers' America? Probably.) For the renegade sixties couple Dave (the talented Canadian actor Robert Joy) and Chrissie (Hollis McLaren, the schizo of Outrageous), the boardwalk is a substitute for the San Francisco of 1966, buried as completely as Atlantis. The pregnant Chrissie wants to take LSD so we can learn from the baby's wisdom and Dave, a coke dealer, wants to dump his stash and his past.Sally (Susan Sarandon), who is both Chrissie's sister and Dave's estranged wife, shovels shrimp behind the counter of a casino oyster bar but meanwhile sees to her dream by attending dealers' school - I gotta develop my blackjack; I'm gonna deal my way to Europe - and, total woman that she is, works on improving her body with lemon juice and her soul with a cassette of Bellini's Norma. When she becomes romantically involved with Lou, she has one request Teach me stuff. Near Sally's tattered domicile (Sally would use that word, rather than the mundane apartment) Lou waits gallantly on Grace (Kate Reid), a former beauty queen and mobster's moll reduced by time and Lou's lack of discipline to a state of kitschy caterwaul.Grace, lying in a bed strewn with ribbons and poodles and other fussy things, bitches at and about Lou; if she were an inanimate object, she'd be a battered pink plastic lawn flamingo, but Lou, a romantic to the tips of his carefully ironed silk ties, cherishes the memory of what she was, while mildy grousing at the monstrous Baby Jane she is.Lou's most notable characteristic is his tolerance a man old enough to have run numbers for the dinosaurs, a man who can say wistfully, The Atlantic Ocean was something then - this is not a man apt to be angry long at infirmity, senility or even cruelty.Lou's dapper, chivalrous, compassionate existence informs the sensibility of Atlantic City with something very much like love; the movie's unpredictably explosive, joke-like tone can be inferred from the fact that Lou's splendid reviviscence is made possible by murder. Atlantic City is a cautionary comedy about a place where dreams can come true. Too true. Benjamin Miller, Filmbay Editor.

America, to a uniquely American city. And this movie is precisely about America in 1978 (when it's set), approaching recovery from the economic miasma of the 70's and the political one of the 60's, struggling under Carter but seeing a light at the end of the tunnel that ultimately proved to be a false idol (the Reagan era).As a nine-year-old growing up in Philly in 1977, I visited A.C. on Labor Day, right before the fall and subsequent rebirth, when the boardwalk was about freak shows, frozen custard and pizza slices as big as your face for 55 cents (and salt water taffy, which remains a staple today), and the rest of the town was about poverty, unemployment and lost hope. All right before the town became the Vegas of the east, full of casinos and glitter and development dollars that led to, today, a seaside slum no better, and in many ways worse, than it was in '77.This film, released at a perfect time (1981), and today the perfect retrospective film, is about the transition from despair to prosperity, with those participating totally unaware of the even greater despair to come.It's Atlantic City, and America, 1978-1982.

It's pleasingly voyeuristic without crossing the line into perversion, and hey, it's just a nice way to start the movie.At first I found it a little hard to accept Lou Pascal (Burt Lancaster, 67 years-old but still ten times as dapper as you or I will ever be) as the small-time former gangster that he's evidently supposed to have been. How could Burt Lancaster have ever been known to his mob cronies as Numbnuts, I wondered. By the end of the film he had me convinced that he really was a small-timer who'd lucked out and gotten one last shot at being what he always wanted to be. I still wondered exactly why he'd never made good before, but for me the fact that he convinced me but still left a lot of unexplored depth to the character is what makes his performance so great.Director Louis Malle strikes exactly the right balance between nostalgia and a bizarre sort of hopeful redemption. You'll know what I mean when you see Lou's exhilaration, towards the end, at a deed which shouldn't really leave one feeling exhilarated (is that a spoiler). He's just so happy that, despite his various criminal undertakings, you can't help but feel good for the old guy.The cinematography made me feel good too, Atlantic City is really a beautifully shot film. There's a great synthesis of natural and artificial light that makes everything look just *a little* better than realistic. Speaking of nostalgia, this sort of cinematography is a talent that sadly seem to have fallen off these days. If you haven't seen it in the theater or on DVD you should do so, it's a world apart from the grimy cable version I first saw.

The beginning of the film determines this key unpredictability that gives it so much of its liveliness. The sequence starts with a close-up of a young woman, who seems as worn out as she is gorgeous, seen through a tenement window in golden lamplight. Systematically she rubs her hands, arms, shoulders, and breasts with lemon halves. As the camera widens, we become aware that she's being watched by an elderly man from a likewise tattered room across the air shaft. Then the events that occur that obliquely cause them to confront one another have all the capricious randomness of life.What makes this lyrical tale rewarding is the tenderness with which Lou treats his only hope at adding up to something, and the insight with which Sally treats Lou. Lou longs to take the drug money as a reward from the heavens and restore his prime. Malle's gratifyingly hard-edged serendipitous drama is set in an tenement near the Boardwalk. It's scheduled for destruction, and everywhere are empty lots full of debris and the sky-cranes of new construction. Each exterior shot looks to have a backdrop of wreckage being heaved out of upper windows, or bulldozers cleaning up empty lots.In this condemned building live three people Oyster-bar waitress Sally, aging numbers runner Lou and widow Grace. The relationship with Grace starts with the detail that she requires Lou to live. To cover her despair, she offends and disparages him like a diva, and he sees right through her. Grace the aging beauty discovers an instinctive bond with Chrissie the hippie, who believes in reincarnation and foot reflexology. They're far apart in age, approach and viewpoints, yet they both form dreams to separate the bleak truth encircling them.As for Lou and Sally, there's something kindhearted and understated happening. Neither is without horse sense. Both have ideas. Both have endured disillusionment. Albeit they could be lovers, they have no prospects together, and perhaps none individually. They need not vocalize this. When he helps her, it's because she needs help, and because he needs to help. His inducement is not the standard fairy-tale stock phrase, but in having an observer who knows that at least once during his decline into anonymity he stepped up to bat and acted as he believes a man should, men who may have been crooks but were influential and appreciated. The movie doesn't reject reality. It ends how, when and why it must, provided what has gone before.

There are points in this finely directed and well-written film where we think something wonderful (or tragic) will happen to them, that they've gotten a lucky break which will enable them to break free from their shallow dreams (or perhaps go down in flames), but in the end, they go right on living like they did before, albeit with a little more money. I daresay everyone on the planet has known someone like Sarandon's Sally, a young woman struggling to make it who's already been through a bad marriage and hard times and is trying to start over. She's pretty but not gorgeous, energetic; she's also foolish, a little crazy, and emotionally unstable to a degree. Sally is training to be a casino dealer, a career she almost blindly hopes will solve all her problems and maybe even allow her to live in France. She approaches the training with all the fervor of someone who's been talked into a pyramid scheme. But just below the almost manic surface, one can tell she is bound to burn out on the idea sooner or later. She never gets the chance though. Burt Lancaster is Lou Pascal, a former mobster (so he says) who hasn't been outside of Atlantic City in twenty-seven years, even though there is nothing for him there anymore, if in fact there ever really was. He is reduced to taking fifty-cent bets from people, mostly tenement dwellers in the poor black community. His companion of sorts is Grace, a woman about his age who, like him, lives in a past that frankly doesn't sound like it's much worth reliving. He waits on her, gets her groceries and does other errands for no particularly good reason other than he's been doing it so long, it's become a habit. They argue a lot but seem to feel genuine affection for each other. Atlantic City itself is shown in the early days of the casino boom, where there are two kinds of people those like Sally who are going to work in the casinos, and those like Lou and Grace who are being pushed aside to make room for the glitzy gambling dens. The old run-down hotels are being torn down. Lou lives in a shabby room in one of them, as does Sally next door, though they don't know each at first. Lou finds himself unexpectedly making big money dealing cocaine (inadvertently courtesy of Sally's ex-husband) and begins playing the high-roller he always wanted to be, and pretends that he once was. But he really does have a heart, and he tries to help and 'protect' Sally. As a quirky slice-of-life, 'Atlantic City' hits almost all the right notes. But as a satisfying drama/character study, it leaves us hanging with an 'is that all there is?' kind of feeling. The thing about the ending isn't that it's such a huge downer, but that it is neither here nor there. We half-expect Lou to die trying to help Sally, or Sally to come to the realization she's been used and that learning French really isn't the answer. Instead, Sally steals most of the drug money from Lou and takes off down the road, none the wiser as far as can be told. And Lou goes back to Grace; the last shot is of them walking down the boardwalk, apparently content to be back where they started. It's more depressing than a genuinely depressing ending.

A once picturesque city with Hollywood-like gangsters big time gamblers, when gambling was illegal, and elegant hotels is now, in 1979, being demolished in order to built a string of flashy casinos and high-rise, mostly hotels, buildings making it look like Disneyland on the Atlantic. One of the old timers who still lives in the city and had seen it's better days is petty hoodlum and once cell-mate, or so he claims, of the notorious Busy Seagel the well dressed tall and impressive looking Lou Pascal, Burt Lancaster. Lou supplements his income of running numbers for local mobster Fred, John McCurry, by being a nursemaid and occasional lover to his shut-in neighbor Grace Pinza, Kate Reid, a former contestant in an Atlantic City Betty Grable look-like contest.Having really nothing to look forward to but being evicted because his apartment building is to soon be knocked down, and replaced with a brand new 40 stories high hotel/casino, Lou spends his free time gazing out of his window and seeing his next door neighbor Sally Matthews, Susan Sarandon, unknowingly do a strip tease act for him by dousing herself with lemon juice and perfume; thats to get out the fishy smell she has from working as a waitress at a casino seafood and oyster bar restaurant.It's later when Sally's estranged husband and pregnant sister Dave & Chrissie, Robert Joy & Hollis McLaren, show up that things become almost unbearable for her and at the same time gives her secret admirer and next-door neighbor Lou the chance he waited for to make a play for Sally but at a very frightful and deadly price. David had heisted a kilo of coke in a Philadelphia telephone booth that was a drop for the local mob and now is trying to find someone in Atlantic City to sell it to. What David doesn't realize is that the word is out all over town that anyone, with no mob connection or references, trying to get that amount of coke on the streets is dead meat courtesy of the Philidelphia Crime Syndicate.Sally reluctantly letting her ex, David, and sister say at her apartment has David roaming the streets in order to find a dealer who can take the stolen coke off his hand for a hefty price and ends up in Fred's place a bar off the boardwalk. Unknown to David Fred is in cahoots with the crime syndicate and secretly has him set up to be hit by mobsters Felix & Vinnie, Moses Znaimer & Angus MacLnnes, who the kilo of coke that he stole back in Philadelphia belongs to.Having met Lou, who helped him out, at Fred's bar David get's the old guy to deliver the coke to Atlantic City mobster Alfie, Al Waxman, who Fred told him to contact. David thinks that Lou, in being such a good friend of local mobster Fred, is a big man with the mob he won't have any trouble doing business, unlike himself a total unknown, with it. Being told by David that he'll pay him $100.00 to deliver the goods or drugs to Alfie Lou desperately needing the money does just that and get's a cool $4,000.00 from a grateful Alfie for his effort. It turns out that as David is waiting to get his money from the drug sale he's spotted and attacked by Vinnie and Filex who end up plunging a knife in his chest killing him.Stuck with the $4,000.00 and the almost kilo of coke Lou is now the odd man out in this drug deal being the only person who has no connection with David and thus home free to sell the rest of the dope unhindered by the mob, who have no idea that he has it. Lou instead tries to do the right thing and use the money to help David's sister Sally who's now suspected by the Phillie mobsters to be in possession of their coke stash.Touching and sensitive drama with a May to December romance between Lou and Sally who at first gets involved in her brothers criminal activities and later the two have to count on each other to have them escape mob vengeance and retribution. Thinking that Sally has somehow hidden the stolen, by the late David, coke Vinnie and Felix ransack her apartment and finding nothing there they grab her, as she's walking on the boardwalk with Lou, and almost beat her unconscious. Lou unable to help Sally, he was knocked on his back by the two half his age hoods, starts to feel less then a man for not at least trying to come to Sally's rescue.It's that incident on the boardwalk that gets Lou into a deep depression since he was always trying to impress everyone he talked to who didn't know the truth about him, being a petty hood and gofer for the mob, in what a big shot he was back then in the good old days. Lou being unable to prevent or protect Sally from the two hoods made him feel like a coward and it was later, with him drowning his troubles with a bottle of booze, that he got a second chance to redeem himself and this time, unlike the first, Lou came through and to the rescue with flying colors.Heartwarming movie with an upbeat ending despite it's depressing subject matter, murder drug dealing betrayal and justifiable homicide, Atlantic City makes no pretenses about how the real world, in this case the city itself, is and how tough it is for someone to survive it like both Lou and Sally. It's sad, even though very necessary, that it took the both primitive and brutal law of the jungle for them to do it.

Lancaster is wonderful as a forgotten old man who likes to think of himself as a big time criminal. Sarandon is equally good as a woman who, having escaped from Saskatechewan, dreams of a life in France or Monaco. The most memorable scenes of the movie have to do with lemons, as Miss Sarandon demonstrates a better use for them than making lemonade. Kate Reid is also good as the woman Lancaster takes care of. Malle does a good job of evoking the atmosphere of a decaying part of Atlantic City. Everything is kept low-key, with the focus on character development.

It was directed by Louis Malle - a European - and reminded me in parts of Leon and Easy Rider. It has a wonderful late career role for the great Burt Lancaster. He plays a two-bit ex-hood who is now nothing more than a servant for his late friends widow. He constantly reminisces about the past grandeur of Atlantic City - even the Atlantic Ocean was different back then! The moment he gets some money, he goes out and buys a white suit and white shoes and wears them through the rest of the movie - looking like a man totally out of place with his surroundings and totally out of touch with reality.Susan Sarandon in an early role is the ambitious small town girl who wants to work in a casino in France. The film opens with her rubbing lemon juice on her breasts. We find out late in the film the very logical explanation for that.This is not a classic because the soundtrack, supporting roles and dialogue are ordinary. Its the two stars that you should watch this film for.

Standout performances, terrific dialogue, beautiful cinematography - so what's not to like? The truth is, I'm just not sure. Something about it rang falsely to me. It may take a while to sort it out. Until then, here's the best I can do.Atlantic City is the tale of Lou Pascal (Burt Lancaster), a small-time former Mafia hood. The Mafia was pushed out of Atlantic City by a bad element (read black gangs) and ever since then, Lou's been running numbers for them and taking care of his old boss's moll, Grace (the marvelous Kate Reid).Living next door to Lou is Sally Matthews (Susan Sarandon, in what is surely her best, most honest work), who works at an oyster bar, takes classes in dealing blackjack, and dreams of going to Monte Carlo to be a professional dealer. Her life is turned upside down when her husband Dave and sister Chrissie (Robert Joy & Hollis McLaren), who ran off together some seven months ago, turn up with Chrissie pregnant and Dave looking to get rid of a massive amount of cocaine he ripped off from some Eurotrash bad guys (one good example of an unbelievable element I disliked).Lou has been watching Sally for some time and has developed something of a crush on her. When he helps Dave unload the cocaine and Dave turns up dead, Lou sees an opportunity to help Sally and gain her confidence - and maybe more.Burt Lancaster invests Lou with more pathos than I've seen him deliver to any other role. There's something almost Method about his work here - he's completely believable, especially near the end, when Lou begins to really confront his failures and deal with them. His moment of catharsis is chilling in the way he revels in its joy. I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just let you watch it and see what I mean. Susan Sarandon is large-eyed and wistful without making you want to slap her. She invests enough naivete in Sally to make her real without making her a caricature.Ultimately, the movie has something to do with how the past is simultaneously healing and murderous, a creature to fear and to cautiously welcome into your heart. It's also about dreams, and where your past and your potential future intersect and why. In both those themes, it has some similarities to Paul Thomas Anderson's work, particularly his Hard Eight, another movie about an old player taking a younger person under his wing.On the whole, it doesn't work as well as Louis malle probably intended, perhaps because of the Eurotrash bad guys, or perhaps because of the bizarre, all-too-Hollywood turn the movie takes a little over an hour in. Nonetheless, it's a worthy and fascinating little piece of work.

It's an apt visual metaphor for the whole film ... sour and vinegary. You've got four or five ordinary people, all living drab lives, who, in their interactions ... complain, gripe, nag, fret, and bark. Except for young Chrissie (Hollis McLaren) who seems to be a bit spaced-out, there's not an optimist in the bunch. Everyone is angry. Even Peppy, the dog, is mad.And who can blame them? Their environment reeks of crime, drugs, thugs, filthy bathrooms, dingy tenement buildings, augmented by the enchanting sounds of construction hammers pounding away on old, dilapidated buildings. Visually, Atlantic City, the film, is uninviting.The story is not memorable because, although the script does provide appropriate character arcs, the characters themselves are not memorable. They are too conventional, too common and inconsequential.One of the two main characters is Sally (Susan Sarandon) who, to the screenwriter's credit, at least makes an effort to improve her life. She is training to be a blackjack dealer, and dreams of working in a European casino. The other main character is Lou (Burt Lancaster), an older gent from Las Vegas who tells people he is, was, or will be an important gangster. I will admit that Sarandon's performance is good and, in my opinion, is the strongest element of the film. Lancaster is, well, Lancaster, and will no doubt appeal to fans of ... Lancaster. In addition to Sarandon's acting, the other element that I found likable was the background instrumental music, though it was not nearly enough to offset the film's overall acidic, lemony, cinematic tone.If the local chamber of commerce had visions that this film could revive their city, they are, by now, clearly attuned to reality. People have continued to leave, since 1980. And, after 85 years in Atlantic City even Miss America has fled to Vegas.
